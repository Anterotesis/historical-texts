 AN ESSAY At Removing  National Prejudices  AGAINST A UNION with  SCOTLAND  To be continued during the Treaty here  PART I  LONDON  Printed in the Year  AN ESSAY at removing National Prejudices  c  HItherto all the Tracts I have seen upon the Subject of the Union serve only to Two Ends  Either Historically to relate what has been done towards a Union in other and former Treaties with the particular Obstructions on either Side  Or to debate the present Question What sort of Union is most proper for the Nations at this time  The several Authors have done so much on the first of these that nothing is wanting to be added to their Work and on the second their Reasonings are many on both Sides which I shall abridge first and then perhaps add something farther which may not be useless in the Case and which as a Column erected on a prepar'd Pedestal may rise up to a compleat Form agreeable in Order and Beauty to the Design  'Tis in vain to commence a Treaty of Union and which must after be referr'd to the great collected Councils on either Side while National Aversions remain unmov'd and Immortal Prejudices fill the Minds of the People  These are the Mountains which must be levell'd to make smooth this Valley of Peace and this is the Feaver in the Blood which 'till 'tis abated and the Inflammation carry'd off the great National Wound can never be cur'd  A Temper to Peace must be found or  if not found  must be form'd in hoth Nations as the great Preliminary to this Treaty and without which it will be in vain to enter upon the greater Articles of it  If this be wanting to what purpose does the Queen invite the Parliament prepare and Commissioners meet other than to furnish Authors to compleat their Historical Accounts of what has been to little purpose attempted towards a Union  And yet I am not speaking here of the Temper of the Commissioners on either Hand with Respect to Union I make no Question but they come on both Sides heartily inclin'd to the thing in general I wish them as sincerely agreing in the Methods  But as what they do is to be recommended to and laid before the Parliaments of both Kingdoms whose Members without any Reflection on them may be variously influenc'd from Causes too many to repeat here and on whom the ancient Prejudices of the Times may have made too large Impressions  For these Reasons I cannot but think 'tis necessary to Essay the Removing those Prejudices in the best manner I can as a thing no Man has yet attempted and as what is absolutely necessary to the great Work we are upon  I believe I may be allow'd to say without any Charge of Partiality or Affectation to our selves or of our real Merit That there are not Two braver Nations in the World or that have more shown their Courage and Gallantry upon all Occasions than the  English  and the  Scots  And as these Two People inhabit one Island neither seperated by dangerous Seas or unpassible Mountains neither bounded with vast Deserts or great Rivers by which either the Communications of Peace and Trade or the Access of War might be rendred difficult the onlooking World has beheld with no less Wonder than Pleasure that they have not to this Day been able to unite in one Body  Their Wonder must needs arise from its being the apparent Interest of both Nations long since to have joyn'd Hands to their mutual Interest and to have joyn'd their Force to their mutual Strength and Defence no Nations in  Europe  whom Nature had seem'd to prepare for such a Union and laid up in store so many visible Advantages of Uniting being to  be supposed so blind to their real Interests without great Scandal even to their Understandings or at least to their Temper It cannot but have seem'd strange to all the Nations of the World who see into the vast Advantages of a Union to both these Kingdoms that they themselves who have neither of them been counted among the foolishest Nations of the World should not see it also and that so many Revolutions of State and of Years as have pass'd over their Heads so many afflicting Circumstances War Blood Devastation and Destruction have not yet been able to make them wise to their own Peace and show them even by the contrary the Necessity as well as the Profit of a firm Union between them such as may for ever shut the Door against the fatal Invasions Depredations and terrible Eruption of Blood and War which with but small Intermissions have alternately afflicted both Kingdoms  Nor has it been without some secret Satisfaction that our Neighbours have observ'd this especially those of them as have either envy'd or apprehended the Addition of Strength such a Union would be to these Nations and the formidable Encrease it would be to the  Britannick  Power It cannot but have been very pleasing to the  French  and  Spanish  Governments with whom we have been at open Wars to observe how the National Animosities between the  English  and  Scots  have always kept them embroyl'd and by spending their Native Fury  terrible to them  upon one another prevented the Mischiefs and lessen'd the Powers  of the English especially  which they had Reason to fear might have otherwise been too formidable for them to oppose  It would be too tedious here to recite the innumerable Instances how the Divisions of these Nations have assisted to the rising Glory of our Neighbours and he that has not read how  France  under  Charles  the Dauphin afterwards  Charles  the VIIth when by the Conquest of  Henry  the Vth she was almost entirely subjected to the  English  recovered  her self chiefly by the Valour and Assistance of the  Scots  must not pass with me for a Historian  Had  Scotland  been then united to  England  and the Thirty Thousand  Scots  which at sundry Times went over to assist that dejected Prince been sent thither to joyn the  English  Armies then under the brave Duke of  Bedford  Regent of  France  and the best Generals  England  ever saw  France  had for ought we know been entirely subjected to the  English  Power and  Britain  had given Law to all these Parts of the World  'T would be endless to trace Antiquity and bring upon the Stage the very many Instances when  Scotland  has had the Fate of  England  in her Hand and again when  England  has put the Yoke upon the Neck of the  Scots  Power The only useful Observation from which to the present purpose is How these alternate Advantages over one another have tended to the weakening both and by a Chain of Disasters has helpt to reduce us both to the present Condition and Danger of being overpower'd by our too potent Neighbours who had these Nations been long ago united under prudent and politick Measures had perhaps been always kept too low to have lookt us in the Face  Now Disaster begins to make us wise and though the Steps both Nations have made toward Union have been very slow yet it is a long time since they both saw it their Interest and have exprest a Willingness to bring it to pass  Whether Providence for Ends yet unknown to us or the Nature of things has retarded it so long is not for me to determine but very small have been the Beginnings and Progress of this Willingness to Unite  The first Step towards a common Courtesy between the Nations was in the Marriage of the Lady  Elizabeth  Daughter of  Henry  the VIIth to  James  the Fourth King of  Scotland  and 'tis remarkable that wise Prince was the first in  England  that foresaw an Advantage to  England  by a Union with  Scotland  the Particulars of which we find noted in History  viz  That when the Match was proposed in Council it met with great Opposition there from an Apprehension that one time other such an Alliance might bring the Crown of  England  into the Line of  ScotlandAnd what is it should  says that wise Prince with a Spirit one would think had been Prophetical  If any such thing should happen I foresee that it will come to pass that our Kingdom of  England  will lose nothing thereby because there will not be an Accession of  England  to  Scotland  but on the contrary of  Scotland  to  England  as to that is by much the more noble Head of the whole Island  Vide  Speed's  Chron Reign of  Henry  the VIIth  Had any Man been by the King that had known what we now come by Length of Time to understand they might have added but it will be the certain Depressing and Ruin of  Scotland  by removing her Court and Gentry by losing the Concourse of Strangers Residence of Ambassadors and consequently the Expence of Money and the Helps to Trade from her Capital City by lessening her Interest in foreign Courts and her Value in the World with innumerable Mischiefs attending the Meanness of a Kingdom without a Head  That  Scotland  by this means would rather seem a Province than a Kingdom and yet remain without the proper Advantages of a Province of  England  also as being treated like Aliens in every thing injurious and detrimental to  England  and as Subjects in every thing advantageous to  England  tho' prejudicial to  Scotland  From this relative Union with  Scotland  under  Henry  VIIth a settled Peace with  Scotland  began and saving some short Intervals under  Henry  the VIIIth from a meer Capricio of that warm Prince the long Peace between the Nations seem'd to prepare them on both Sides for more strict Engagements by wearing out the Remembrance of former Injuries and lessening the Native Animosities of the People  Since this we have had four Conjunctures in which the  oser Union we are now to treat about has been in some more than common manner enter'd upon and which I may say were especially proper to have brought it to pass  The First under King  Edward  the VI when the Protestant Religion being just settled here  England  courted her Siser  Scotland  to joyn Hands and become one Family under that good Prince It was the first Juncture that we read of that  England  was governed by a young unmarry'd King and  Scotland  by a young unmarry'd Queen at the same time nothing was so natural as that by Marriage the Kingdom would become one in the next Blood of both Races  The  English  made the Offer first in  Henry  the VIIIth's time and now renew'd it and the Contempt the  Scots  seem'd to show of it and which appear'd to be the Faction of the Popish Party fearing the Reformation provok'd the  English  to a War in which the  Scots  were overthrown in the great Battel at  Pink  or  Muscelburgh  'Twas at this time the famous Declaration was emitted by the Duke of  Somerset  the  English  General when though he was Conquerour he told the  Scots  he came not to conquer them but unite with them and to offer them all the Advantages of the  English  Amity Some of the most significant Expressions of which Declaration are such as these  We Conquer and yet we propose Peace We gain Victory by War and we offer Amity and Friendship by Peace We seek not Conquest but Alliance that you may be united in all things with us in Marriage in Trade and all the Advantages of a lasting Amity  If any Man please to read the said Declaration at large too long to be incerted here he will easily see that Age had quite different Thoughts from us concerning a Treaty with  Scotland  that they knew a Possession of Conquest would never keep  Scotland  and that Union not Victory was the common Interest of this Nation  But the  Scots  then could not see their Interest the Power of Popish Councils prevail'd upon them and for Fear of Reformation they rejected the just Advantages to the State and sent away the Queen privately to  France  The next Turn was more effectual and this was at the Coming of King  James  the VIth of  Scotland  to the Crown of  England  The Prophetick Expressions quoted before from the Mouth of  Henry  the VIIth were now come to pass and the Crown of  England  devolv'd upon the House of  Scotland  Had K  James  done Justice to his Native Country had he thought of their future Prosperity in short had he thought of any thing but neglecting his own Kingdom and suppressing the true Interest of itit was without doubt absolutely in his Power to have brought an entire Union to pass and to have ended all the Difficulties Disputes and Quarrels that afterward embroil'd these Kingdoms in bloody Wars to their mutual Ruin and Destruction But as there were People and Parties then to be found who envy'd and perhaps fear'd the publick Tranquility so there has never since wanted a succeeding Race to inherit their Rancour and who on all Occasions blow the Coals of Dissaffection between the two Nations  How the good Endeavours of those People who at the Death of Queen  Elizabeth  labour'd hard to begin the new Reign with a Union of Nations came to be defeated and the further Prosecution of it dropt how King  James  forgetting the true Interest of his Country instead of gratifying the  Scots  with what might have been for the general Good of the Kingdom only brought a long Train of them hither who gaping for Preferment and equally neglecting their own Country serv'd only to make the  English  jealous and uneasy and consequently averse to uniting These are Stories too tedious and too remote to engage in here 'tis enough to leave it to Posterity that the thing was attempted but ill persued the blessed healing Juncture being reserv'd to an Opportunity yet to come  How after this the  Scots  differ'd with K  Charles  the Ist on his Attempt to impose the  English  Servicebook upon them How they came to a Pacification without Blood or with but a little How afterwards they fully paid the ill Treatment of the Father K  James  upon the Son whose Ruin their Army then entring  England  compleated by turning the Scale of the King's Affairs and overballancing his Forces at the Great Battel at  Marstonmoor  I leave for those Gentlemen to consider who upon all Occasions are for reckoning the  Scots for nothing  in their Calculations and thinking they merit no Regard in the general Account of the Strengths of  Europe  In the Interval of Affairs here under the Parliament and  O Cromwel  we find a real Union between the Kingdoms carried on to a kind of Settlement though something imperfect but whoever contriv'd it such a Settlement it was as had the next Government thought fit to have built upon it might have risen up to all the Parts of a compleat Union but this dyed with the Times and the Constitution of  Scotland  return'd to its full Exercise under King  Charles  the IId  At the Revolution under King  William  I must own the  Scots  had the fairest Opportunity of perfecting the thing that perhaps they will ever again be trusted with  The  English  Affairs were then in that Condition that I cannot but say the  Scots  might have almost forc'd it upon us if they would There could have been hardly any Article in the Matters of Trade or Government which the Crown of  England  would not have been in a manner very free to give up to secure the  Scots  then in the Interest of the new establish'd Government which for some time 'twas expected they would waver in whether the  Scots  in the so speedy Concession and falling in with the  English  Settlement did not show more Generosity than Discretion and whether they have been gratefully treated for it since I purposely omit because being to treat of a Union of the Two Kingdoms with Design to prepare both Sides for it I would  p up no old Sores nor  bring to Remembrance any thing that should tend to prepossess either Nation against the other  This Opportunity has been lost and now the last Juncture perhaps that ever may offer it self for the closing this mortal Breach seems to appear  What Steps were made toward it  or rather from it  in a late Commission and  seeming Treaty  I also purposely omit and though the Umbrage taken here at the  Scots  Act of Security the  preposterous Lav  made here which was in its Nature a Declaration of War the marching Troops to the North fortifying of  Hull  and the like are things merit some Satyr yet they who consider this Nation then under the Influence of a Party  and of such a Party  as were especially known by their Aversion to  Scotland  as well as  to Ʋnion in general  will easily forget these Things as the Remains of a Temper always destructive to the Good of both Kingdoms and as Indications only that this was not the proper Season for a Union  But Time and the Consequences of Things have brought both the Nations to more healing Measures and  England  now under the Influence of better Counsels has thought fit to show the  Scots  their Forwardness to take away all just Pretences from those People that willingly lay hold of them to widen the Breaches of the Nations In order to this the Parliament has rescinded and abrogated that Act which gave such Offence to the  Scots  and without which they had declar'd they could not Treat And I cannot but observe that the  Scots  not puting the Notice they took of that Act into their Bill in Parliament but into an Address to the Queenand the  English  Parliament voluntarily repealing the Act which was injurious to  Scotland  in order to make way for this Treaty seems to be two healing Steps and such mutual Advances as gives great Encouragement to those People who hope for a good Issue of the present Treaty By these Things those People were intirely disappointed who waiting for an Advantage ov  the  Scots  laid hold of the Case of  Green and his Crew  exaggerating  and exclaiming against the pretended Injustice of those Executions as a sufficient Ground of a  National Quarrel  though at the same time there were two  Scots  hang'd to one  English  Man and those condemn'd by the Ordinary Forms of Justice and Legal Process in which the forgot that had they all been  English  Men and had after appear'd to be perfectly innocent yet that as a Nation the  Scots  can be answerable for no more than giving Persons a fair and legal Tryal according to the ordinary Course of Justice under which if unhappy Circumstances invol d them and they fell yet by the Law of Nations no Publick Blame can by this be fixt upon the  Scots  nor any Pretence of a Quarrel be justly rais'd upon that Foundation  I know now nothing to hinder the good Issue and Conclusion of the present Treaty no Cloud upon the Prospect of the Success of it nothing to apprehend so much from real as imaginary Difficulties that are raised and kept alive by those that really are afraid so great a Blessing should befal this Nation  In order therefore to remove the Mists and Vapours of Imagination from the Eyes of the People and prepare Mens Minds for Union the Design of this Work is To remove the Prejudices settled or that seem to be settled in the Minds of the Common People of both Nations against each other that a Union of the Nations may as already it is to all wise Men be really desireable to both Sides  As this is what no Man has yet attempted I hope it may be an acceptable thing to both Sides and may open our Eyes to a second Article  viz  the Advantage of a Union to both the Nations  And having in this Tract gone thro' these Heads I shall in the subsequent Part of the Work examine a little the Terms of a Union remove the Difficulties expose the Artifice of those that form Objections from needless Fears and Jealousies show how a Union may be made without any Danger to or clashing in the Interests of the Establish'd Churches of or the tollerated  Dissenters in either Nation clear up their Eyesight who cannot see the Interest of their Native Country and so go on to state the Fact in such proper Schemes of Eternal Peace as may backt with the Wisdom of both Nations terminate in the lasting Tranquility and visible Encrease of the Power Wealth and Magnificence of the most powerful Island in the World  st In removing the Prejudice on both Sides I cannot but observe There is a manifest Difference in such things as these and a Difference which more than ordinarily influences the Success of such an Action between coming to a Treaty WILLING designing and prepar'd TO REMOVE Difficulties and bring the thing it self to a happy Conclusion And on the other hand coming PREPAR'D TO RAISE Difficulties Cavil Dispute and Embarrass a Treaty that in Time may end in a Rupture vanish into Air and come to nothing  National Prejudices are some of the worst sort of Humane Antipathies and as they may be applyed have frequently very bad Effects And I cannot clear the  English  from the just Charge of being the Nation in the World the most addicted to them and when once they have entertain'd such unhappy Notions are the hardest of any Nation in the World to be brought off from them again tho' I hope they will not be so influenc'd here  It is too long a Work here to examine this Particular or to give Originals for inbred Antipathies of Nations to say why the wild ungovern'd  Irish  that mortally hate the very Name of an  English  Man and have often with the utmost Barbarity murther'd Thousands of our People in cold Blood are less hated by us than the  Dutch  between whom and this Nation mutual Engagements and National Kindnesses have frequently pass'd to the common Advantage of both why the  French  between whom and this Nation frequent terrible and bloody Wars have often happen'd are more respected than the  Scots  who inhabit the same  Terra Firma  Natives of the same Island  ally'd by Intermarriages both in Kings Nobility and Common People and who live  among one another  trade together speak the same Language prosess the same Protestant Religion and confederated together by a relative Union under the same Head  'Tis true former Wars Invasions and Depredation on either Side have laid the Foundation of these Animo  ties which 'tis impossible to say which Nation has acted with  Blame  Blood Devastation  all sorts of  Cruelties  Br  Fa  Honour  and the  Laws  of  Nations  have been too common on both Sides and that Action of King  Edward  the III  tho' otherwise a glorious Prince  in hanging up the Two Sons of the Brave Governor of  Berwick given as Hostages for the Surrender of the Town if not reliev'd before such a time  only because he would not give up the Town before the Time was expir'd  is a thing so detestable in its kind  and such a Blot to the Memory of that great Conqueror that if there were no other things to be mention'd against us we ought for ever to be silent as to former Reproaches An Action so horrid that their own Mother fill'd with Indigation at the Barbarity came to her Husband and entreated him not to betray his Country into the Hands of so cruel an Enemy to save her Children justly arguing that after he had thus broke his Faith with them in the Case of her Children what Honour could they expect from him in the rest that her Sons would die with Honour and be an eternal Infamy to the Memory of the cruel Mutherer that God might give them more Children but their Country once betray'd could never be recovered One would therefore think Time should now race out the Remembrance of these Things on both Sides and since the Injuries of War were always reciprocal and the  Scots  had perhaps as much to complain of as we it seems strange the Seeds of that antient Strife should remain now the Generations concern'd are remov'd out of the way and the several Occasions of those Animosities are absolutely buried  in the Grave of Time never to be reviv'd but by the most unaccountable Folly and Madness this Age can be guilty of  But not to enter too far back upon the ungrateful Task of examining our Forefathers Miscarriages I shall come to the present National Prejudices which I think seem to prepare the Minds of the People with unhappy Aversions to Union And these I take to be such as follow  I On Our Side against the  Scots  For  st  Their Share in the last Civil War  As to this I can only say 'tis too long a Quarrel to decide here and merits on all Sides to be buried in Oblivion since take it from Beginning to End the  Scots  suffered deeply had their Share in the blood and Ruin of their Kingdom and at last suffer'd almost an entire Reduction to  England  for attempting to restore our Monarchy Of which by it self  As to the vulgar Mob Charge of  selling the King  which ignorant People  and no other  reproach them with 'Tis needless to enter into the History of it but refer the Objector to these few Observations  They had no Power to have protected his Majesty or to defend themselves against an inevitable War with  England  which with a potent and victorious Army threatned to fall upon them if they had carried the King away  They were under no Ties of Obligation to the King as a Prisoner taken They were in Arms against him and he came and put himself into their Hands to their great Surprize which is a yielding at Discretion and by the Law of Arms left them at Liberty to dispose of him as they thought fit and his Majesty was sensible the Necessity of their Affairs made it impossible for them to detain him unless they would immediately have come over to his Cause which they could not do nor did the King expect they would having been in Arms against it  Nor did they take any Mony as a Price for the King only agreed to depart and deliver the King who they durst  not keep and capitulated to have the Money paid them which was due from the Parliament to them before  And lastly Nor did  they part with the King  without making Articles with the  English  in his Behalf that they should treat him with Freedom Honour and Safety which Articles if they had been kept the King had been a Gainer by what the  Scots  did on his Behalf And if these Agreements were after broken and the King ill treated 'tis the  English  must answer for that not the  Scots  who not only complain'd of it but resented it so highly that they took Arms against the Parliament on that very Score to revenge his Death and made great Attempts to restore his Son even to their own Ruin and the Subversion of their Constitution  So that doing Justice this Prejudice is absolutely groundless and unreasonable and seems to be rais'd upon the  Scots  only to extenuate what some People sell into with respect to that Prince and can therefore leave no just Reproach upon the  Scots  who 'tis evident by the Ruin they brought upon themselves in endeavouring to restore the Son were no way capable of defending the Father  Whether then shall we come for a Prejudice against the  Scots  the most significant Objection we have against uniting with them is that they are Presbyterians and  What if they were Papists  Are Differences in Opinion incompatible with Union How do we see the Numbers of  Roman  Catholicks in  Holland  no manner of Obstruction to the Union of the Provinces the Popish and Protestant Cantons of the  Swiss  united in a perpetual Confederacy All the Prejudices that arise from this Suggestion amount to no more than this not that it impedes a Union in the most absolute and extensive Meaning at all but that 'tis with Reluctan  e that they should see it  This without any Injustice I call PartyPrejudice and now they begin to  us the Danger of the Church of  England  will be brought upon the Stage again and that here will be an evident Proof of it which no body can answer and we begin already to be threatned with that Clamour  To remove at least the Groundwork of this Pretence I think it may be proper a little to enter into a History of Probabilities and calculate the Strength of Parties here as briefly as possible  There is indeed some Difference here not between Author and Author among our High Church Champions but between Authors and themselves sometimes they will have the Dissenters so inconsiderable a Party that they can be eas  ly supprest and ought to be so to prevent growing Mischiefs at other times the same Authors will have them be so formidable that they are every Day frighting their Children with their running and overturning both Church and State What shall we do with such People as these If it serves their Turn to cry out of  the Danger of the Church  and the fatal Plots of the Dissenters then they are a formidable Party and the Government must be warn'd against them and the Church is call'd upon to stand fast and quit themselves like Men  and the like  If they find it proper to vaunt a little and insult the Dissenters then they are a mean and contemptible Party and not worth any Body's Notice  Upon this Uncertainty 'tis evident there can no just Calculation be made from these People's Judgments but let us come to the Case  If we come to unite  say these Gentlemen  the Presbyterian Power of  Scotland  joyn'd to the Dissenters in  England  will be too strong for the Church and we shall be overwhelm'd by the Party and the Church destroy'd  Let us see if  the Reverse of this  be not most probable It is the general Opinion that as to Numbers the Dissenters in  England  set against the Church are not more than One to Twelve as to Wealth and Interest in Trade they are allow'd to be much more but as to Numbers 'tis all wise Mens Opinion that one in Twelve is the Outside In  Scotland  by the same general Calculations the Episcopal Party who I now call Dissenters are at least accounted to Now tho' the whole Number of  Scots  were joyned to the Dissenters in  England  and were put in a Ballance of Numbers 'tis certain they would fall short of being a Match for the Church then add their Poverty to the rest which is the certain and constant Destruction  of great Designs the Church can be in no Danger in Point of Strength if Providence were to stand neuter and the Arms of Flesh to try it out  Let no Prejudices therefore fill our Minds with respect to the Interest of the Church of  England  the Wealth and Strength of  England  whose Government is wholly a Church of  England  Establishment is beyond all Comparison superior to the Power of the Dissenters were they so bereav'd of their Senses as to attempt to disturb it  Whoever therefore forms Prejudices in the Heads of the People of  England  concerning Dangers to the Church from this Union must give me leave to say it is done with a sinister Des gn against the publick Peace of both Nations and without any manner of Foundation grounded either upon Reason Truth or the Nature of Things  Not but that there are other Reasons to prove that the Church of  England  can take no Umbrage from this Union which are drawn from the Interests of each Nation and from the Circumstances of the  Scots  which I omit here as not to this purpose  But when we consult the Article of meer Strength there is no Shaddow of Danger to the Church from the Union but what at the same time will hold good to make us fear an entire Conquest of this Nation by the  Scots  WITHOUT A UNION which they will allow to be ridiculous  If I was to turn the Argument I confess I cannot speak with the same Assurance that there is the same Safety to the  Scots  in the Case of their uniting with so powerful a Government as the Church of  England  Establishment in this Nation what an encroaching Party here may not attempt or at least what they would not attempt if the  Sacred Postulata  of this Union should not be backt with the Protection of the Government I will not answer for but the Security of the Publick Faith will have some Reasons besides the Hone  ty of such a Cause to protect the  Scots  in all their just Rights Of which I shall speak by it self  I cannot imagine why it should remain as a Prejudice in the Minds of the People of either Nation that they differ in some Articles of Religion since a general Uniformity in Religious  Matters is not so much as hoped for in this Nation and can really justify the Prejudices against the  Scots  no more than it does our own unnatural Divisions one among another  The Difference in both Nations is not  of Religion  but in  Religious Circumstances  both are Protestant both Orthodox in Principle and equally opposite to Popery and Antichristianism The Establishments of either Nation have no manner of Occasion to interfere and an alternate Toleration might easily make a Reconciliation of Charity be universal  How foolish then must National Prejudices be and how much to our own Detriment as well as to the Encouragement of the Enemies of both Nations in that they tend to keep disunited two Nations whose Divisions have been the Destruction of so many hundred thousand brave stout Fellows whose Force employ'd against Foreign Nations might have made  Britain  Mistress of half the Nations of  Europe  II The next Rank of Prejudices is of the  Scots  Side against us  These are such as our possessing their Sovereign removing their Court oppressing their Trade neglecting them in our publick Treaties excluding them in Advantages as Aliens and using them as Natives in Cases to their Loss ruining their Collony in  Da  ten  seizing their East  India  Ships and the like  Of these I only say in general as they are the proper Reasons why the  Scots  should desire this Union so they cannot prejudice them against it because by a Union they will be all remov'd and in the pursuit of this Work I shall undertake to show how they may be remov'd to the general Satisfaction of both Nations  I know there are Prejudices relating to Trade and some People have entertain'd Opinions of the  Scots  ruining us and enriching themselves by Encroachments upon our Trade but if I make it appear that a Freedom of Trade is our Advantage more than the  Scots  that the  Scots  have been opprest by us in Trade and that tho' they shall grow rich it shall be also our Advantage I shall then effectually remove this Prejudice Of which by it self  And this leads me of Course to examine the Advantages of this Union on the Mistakes of which farther Prejudices are grounded and tho' I cannot enter into the particular and separate Advantages till I come to examine the Heads of Commerce  and the relative Consequences with Respect to one another and with Respect to our Neighbours yet I cannot but a little consider the general Advantages which both Nations shall obtain in the Conclusion of this happy Union in order to open Peoples Eyes to their own Felicity and to move our Posterity to bless us for putting an End to the ruinous Distempers of both Nations  I am not ignorant that in all Cases it is Natural for Men to examine what Benefit what Advantage shall fall to them by every thing they undertake Nor is any Man that has consider'd or discours d in  England  of this Union ignorant that  s labour'd very diligently  by some Men  to fill our common Peoples Mouths with this QuestionWhat shall We  We Englishmen get by it  We don't doubt but  Scotland  shall be the better by it by being let into our Trade and let into our Manufactures and let into all the Advantages of an  Englishman  But what shall WE get by it  If then the ensuing Sheets open this Scene to the View of the People and prove to the common Understanding that the Advantages of this Union  shall be greater  to  England than to Scotland  it must of Course reconcile all unprejudic'd impartial People to the Union in general and this Inference I purpose shall run through every Head of the ensuing Discourse  And First  after which if I was name no more it was sufficient to move us all to desire this Union above all National Blessings  the inestimable Advantage  of GENERAL PEACE a settled a  Perpetual  Peace a final End of Depredation Ruin Devastation and Blood a  National Friendship  succeeding the most inveterate  National Feuds  a general Tranqu  ty following unsettled and precarious Circumstances which has so often broke out into fierce and destructive Wars as has at several times been supposed to cost the Price of four Millions of the best Blood in  Chri  endom  Can either Nation  if in their Wits  say this is not a sufficient Advantage to make us desire this Union Let us lock back to the Fields of  Bannocksbourn  Muscelborough  and  Dunbar  and  if the Fountains of Blood opened at those fatal Places merit not to be stopt and whether it is not the Wisdom  of both Nations to covet the preventing our Posterity running into the same Violence and Excesses Let the Nobility and Gentry of both Nations examine  the Line of their Families  back but a few Ages and see what noble Branches of their Ancestors spilt their Blood on the desolate Borders and how the Bones of their Noble Progenitors lie buried blended with the Carcasses of the common People and buried in the Ditches of  both Countries  by the Hands of the Conquerors  Let the Curious look back into History and tell me what has been the Consequences to the Northern Countries of  England  from above three Hundred formal Invasions of the  Scots  Armies In some of which we have seen them on the Banks of the  Humber  and in others they have pierc'd even to the rich Valleys on the  Trent  let them describe if they know how the Ruin and Destruction of the Country the Burnings Plunderings Rapes and Violences which in all Ages are the Consequences of Armies ranging an open and defenceless Country If they can find proper Epethets for I profess my self uncapable let them represent in moving and suited Expressions the  Complaints  of the distress  d Country the  Groans  of the murther'd Innocents the Cries of the Widows and Mothers for their Husbands and Children the  Despair  of flourishing Families ruin'd and undone with their Fields  over run  their Barns and Houses  plunder'd and burnt  their Cattle  driven away  and their whole Substance  destroy'd  Why should these things be less present with us for the Circumstances being remote  as to time  unless we were  throughly assur'd  it should never fall out so again  If it were thus now or if it be possible to suppose these things acting upon the present Stage of this Nation if we were to suppose a  Scotch  Army enter'd upon the Northern Countries What would be the Language of the Inhabitants What their Request to an  English  Parliament  Let him that cannot guess  look back no farther than to the Petition of the Country in the Time of King  Charles  the Ist when the  Scots  having given the  English  a Brush at the Passage of  Newnham  Bridge possess'd themselves of  NewCastle  and all the best and richest of the Northern Parts of  England  the Cry of the People was then as it would be now and as is most Natural to suppose  PEACE PEACE  But some say we are too strong for the  Scots  now and there is no Fear that ever they shall invade our Country any mere for that our Wealth and Strength is so much encreased that we are able to crush them presently and can always keep the War  out of our own Country  that as we are become more powerful the  Scots  are become weaker as we are richer they are poorer than  ver and therefore the Case alters  I shall speak more particularly to this when I come to examine the separate Interests of both Nations in which perhaps it may be necessary to make some Calculations and compare Circumstances And I only take Leave at present to assure the judicious considering Reader of these Sheets that even comparing Circumstances the  English  Nation has as much  or perhaps more  Reason to covet a lasting indissolvable Peace between the Nations than the  Scots  and consequently to press for a National Union as the only way effectually to bring it to pass  But I am now upon  the General only  in which when I speak of Peace as the Consequence of a General Union methinks I should speak to the general Understanding of every Man And without examining whether we have more need of Peace than the  Scots  let me ask a few Questions  Have our Northern Counties got any thing by the long Intervals of Peace which for the last Years has with some Interruption been establish'd between the Nations Let any Man view the Borders let them examine the Rents of Lands in  Northumberland  and  Cumberland  and tell me if they are not more than three times encreas'd in Value besides the Differences in the general Value of things since the Battel at  Muscelborough  Is there any different Face upon the Outsides of things  since mutual Depredations laid and kept all things waste  Are the  Scots  Borders waste so were Ours Are Ours improv'd so might Theirs be For I make no Question the Country North by  Tweed  is as capable of Improvement as that on the South of the same River But as the present Difference  is owing to to another Cause  I shall treat of that by it self only I say and I make no Question to prove had the Lands from  Berwick  to  Edenburgh  been under the same Tenantry but under  English  Articles of Possession and Leases from the Landlord as the Lands from  Berwick  to  NewCastle  they would have been eq al in Value both as to Landlord and Tenant some few Mountains excepted equally fruitful and pleasant and the unhappy Circumstances Customs and Constitution of  Scotland  not the Want of Native Wealth Fruitfulness of Soil or Industrious Inhabitants makes her a poor and barren Nation and which it is not yet too late to recover whether this Union proceed or not  General National Peace  therefore is a most desirable Article and the greatest Advantage imaginable to both Nations  To This  to preserve what Wealth they have gain'd and secure the flourishing Condition they are arriv'd to  To That  for recovering them from the Poverty and Decay of their Affairs to which they want nothing but Freedom of Circumstances and Peace as the only thing which made us rise without them  If Peace then shall be the Consequence of this Union never let any Man ask me  What We shall get by it  We shall get the Security and quiet Possession of the Wealth and Improvements of our own Country a thing which  let us boast never so much of our Strength  will be very precarious and exposed to manifest Hazards  in Case of a War  and as our Circumstances in  England  may be and our Hands full another way  as they are now  may be impossible to defend  I could here enter into the Inquiry of the strange  unproportion'd Circumstances  of a War if ever that unhappy time should come in  England  between the Nations and tho' we flatter our selves with reducing the  Scots  by Force and some  very weak Debates  have pass'd on both Sides upon that Head yet to come closer to the Matter I must beg Pardon to tell my Warlike Readers that such People may understand for ought I know what belongs to fighting with the  French  or  which they had rather be at  with the  Dutch  or  which most of all they would be glad of  with ONE ANOTHER but they seem not at all to understand what it is  to fight with the SCOTS  Perhaps therefore such will think these following Conclusions of mine strange Paradoxes and for the present I shall leave them uninterpreted not doubting but knowing Men on both Sides  will reach their Meaning and for the rest I shall explain my self hereafter  Supposing the present happy Temper of both Nations towards a Union should  to all our Misfortunes  go off and end as to me it seems inevitably necessary in a bloody War between the Nations    If the  Scots  should beat you  invade  Northumberland  pierce even into  Yorkshire  rout your Forces destroy the Country and the like  they would be      If you invade  Scotland beat their Armies traverse the Country and driving the  Scots  to their Inaccessibles and Retreats make what you call a Conquest  you are undone  Every Victory you gain over them in the Field  you are beaten  the  Scots  are Conquerors by it and  you Losers  If you will keep an Army upon them to maintain your Conquest and keep them in Subjection  you make them  and they shall thank you  At the End of every War  they shall have the better of you  it shall cost you more to hold them than to gain them and more to lose them again  than both  There are more of these Paradoxes which in Time I may enter upon the Explication of and which I doubt not will be made plain to the Understandings of all those that can view Things with an impartial Judgment and free from National Prejudices on either Side by which it will appear the Advantages of this Union will be greater to the  English  than to the  Scots  But to proceed  about this Article of Peace there  is another Peace  which tho' equally a Blessing  I doubt I am not talking to a People equally desirous of  and such is our Unhappiness that it is the Fear of  this Peace  which for ought I know may be the greatest Obstruction to some Peoples Desire  of a Ʋnion  and this is  an Ecclesiastical Peace  a Peace of Religion or rather  a Church Peace  I confess I cannot but wonder at the Temper of those Christians  they would be angry if I should not call them such  who will have it be that the Church of  England  and the Church of  Scotland  are Two Religions or that the Nations profess Two Religions  Such People as first they seem to know little what Religion means and that it is indivissible in it self by any other Article than the Object of Religion  so they will not understand  that nothing can intitle any People to the Charge of professing a  different Religion  but the Worship of a  differing Deity  But some People will have Breaches seem wider than they really are in order to fright the Lovers of Union from the Attempt of closing  I could heartily wish there were no such Thing as a Difference in the Opinions of Christians worshipping the same Original Author and Maker of all Things professing  the same Faith  in the  same Redeemer  the same  Hope  and on the  same Terms  with one another But the Wisdom of inscrutable Providence whose End in it 'tis  neither possible  nor  needful  for us to know has even from the Beginning of the Christian Religion in the World permitted it to be otherwise  and who are we that we should pretend to dispute it with him  Perhaps these Things are suffer'd in the Church of  Christ  for the Exercise of the Charity Forbearance and mutual Temper of Christians to prevent worse Inconveniencies which from the Pride of Prosperity the Power and Glory of an united Church might in Conjunction with Human Infirmity have risen in the World but whether this is a rational Conjecture or no 'tis manifest that these Offences must come and tho' I will not subjoin the Text  Woe be to him by whom they come  I cannot refrain saying  Woe be to him  by whom they are willfully increased and continued  But to proceed  for I desire to abridge the most needful Digressions as much as possible as to them that desire to widen  our Church Breaches  God in his Mercy open their Eyes to judge better of Things and to be more concern'd for the Peace of their Native Country on both Sides  and there I leave them  as a Sort of Incorrigibles capable of no other Conviction than what shall proceed from the irresistable Force of an invisible Worker of as great Miracles as these  and loe I turn to the Christians  for these can hardly merit that Name  To you  Gentlemen of both Nations  that desire to see the Protestant Churches of  Britain  flourish that desire to see the Union of the Body  under One united Head  join'd in Charity Forbearance  and Love  that are zealous sor Christian Liberty  as well as Civil Liberty and that would rejoice to see differing Establishments agree to go Hand in Hand  the direct Road to Heaven  you cannot but covet this Union you cannot but foresee it will remove all the secret Grudgings Repinings and Jealousies between Two Nations of whom never was Scripture better adapted to the Circumstances of both than that of  Abraham  to  Lot Let no Strife be between us for we are Brethren  Gen  Would then those Gentlemen who cry out of Persecution and Severities exercis'd upon their Episcopal Brethren in  Scotland tho' those Things are far lesstrue than have been suggested  would they obtain a settled legal Tolleration in  Scotland  for  Episcopal Dissenters  founded in the Charity and Tenderness to them on the Part of the Government and their peaceable obedient and Christian Behaviour and Submission to the Laws on their Part Things on which all Christian Governments do depend  this would effect it  Establishments and National Churches are here sixt on both Hands and 'tis the farther establishing and fortifying those Settlements  not the exposing them to change or invasion on either Hand  which is the Principle End of all the Religious Part of a Union  As for those People who expect the  Scots  to rescind their Settlement restore a Church Government which they do not approve of and subject National Principles to Foreign Constitution they show indeed their Zeal for their own Opinion  but not their Sense of the Circumstances of both Nations  in which unalterable Establishments both Civil and Religious are already consented to by the Legislature of each Kingdom nor do these People seem to understand what the Union we are upon means  'tis no Way the Business of a Ʋnion TO ALTER  but  TO CONFIRM  secure and render impregnable the present Settlements of both Kingdoms that when we come to live as Brethren under One Administration there may be a  Noli me tangere  plac'd upon these Things and they may be capable of no Invasion Alteration or Dissolution either by the Power of the Strongest or the Concessions of the Weakest  The Constitutions and Establishment of Religious Matters being thus settled made Sacred and inviolable a thoro' effectual legal Tolleration  of Orthodox Opinions  dissenting from the Establishments in either Kingdom will be  an Alternative  which no Christian Member on either Side  will debate  being a Debt from  One  Kingdom  to the Other  and  from Both  to the Weakness and good Meaning of  their fellow Christians  as also a due Homage paid to  the Sovereignty of Conscience  which is and ought to remain free and unimpos'd upon in all Things the general Subjection to the Being and Authority of our Maker and Acknowledgment of him by religious Worship only preserv'd and supported  Shall any Man say to me These Things are not Advantages sufficient to move us on both Sides to a sincere  Concurrence in  and  Pursuit of  a National Union What shall they have to object when all our Religious  or rather Irreligious  Feuds shall die and be buried under  the Immortal Column  of National Establishment and Legal Tolleration when Envy and Invasion shall be render'd impracticable and the Doors be barr'd and secur'd by the Locks and Bolts of the Law against all manner of Divisions that can be any Way fatal to the general Harmony of the Whole when the Nations shall be united  in nothing wherein they ought to differ  and differ  in nothing wherein they ought to unite  when they shall unite in Affection where they cannot unite in Opinion and never differ in Charity tho' they may differ in Judgment  And I cannot but note here one Observation of my own As a Man that is safely landed on a firm and high Rock out of the Reach of the insulting Waves by which he was in Danger of Shipwreck surveys the distant Dangers with Inexpressible Satisfaction from both the Sence of his own Security and the more clear Discovery of the Reality of the Hazards he had run which did not perfectly see before  So it will not only be an inexpressible Pleasure to us to  look back  and see the Dangers we shall be delivered from in  bot h Nations  when this happy Union shall once be obtained but we shall then with Astonishment see plainly such Rocks such Shelves and such inevitable Gulphs of Destruction avoided as our keenest Understanding will not permit us now to imagine possible  I have heard that when the  Spanish Armada  in was  after all our fabulous Stories of Sir  Fra Drake  and his Wonders  by the meer Hand of Providence Storm and Tempest  more than our Opposition  disperss'd scatter'd and by various Disasters render'd useless to the Design and the Expedition overthrown Q  Elizabeth  was often heard to say that  had they enter'd the Mouth of the Thames  and been joyn'd by the Duke of  Parma  from  Flanders  who lay ready to come over with Men of the best Troops the World ever saw  England must have submitted  and she had been undone and her Majesty own'd  she say more of the Danger then after  they were beaten  than she did before  I have not Room to prove here that the Queen's Observation was just which  any that knows  the History of those Times that the D of  Parma  who was one of the greatest Generals and the  Spanish  Troops then the best Soldiers of that Age and that the Queen's Forces were all raw undisciplin'd new rais'd and rather Crowds of  Militia  than a real Army  will readily join in it  But my Observation is from the Queen s reflecting back on this  more particularly after the Danger was over  and the Nation delivered  than before  And I firmly believe if ever this happy Union of the Nations comes to a Conclusion those Gentlemen that talk very slightly of it now and seem rather willing to keep open the Breach than to close it will see things with a different Aspect will have their Opticks extended and see the Gulphs and Precipices which they blinded by Ignorance and Prejudices are now willing to push the Nations upon not having Reach enough to discern the Danger  But to go on with our Head of Advantages from a National Union    Safety and Security  And by this Head I do not mean barely  against one another  and the many unhappy Consequences of the present precarious Circumstances of both Nations as they respect future War or Peace but I mean also the mighty Additions of Strength and Security against any Foreign Enemy when the Power of both Nations is twisted together and interwoven one with another by their mutual Interests and in this I must be allow'd to say without the least Partiality that the Advantage is  wholly on Englands Side  whose Power is by the Addition of  Scotland  so fortify'd that it must be her own Fault if she does not make a different Figure in all the Affairs of  Europe  to what she ever did before  Some have the ill Nature to object here that this Union will  enrich Scotland  which they think  no Advantage to England  but if  Scotland  shall now become a Branch of  England  and we are no more divided into Kingdoms and Governments but make one united Government of  Great Britainr▪ Whose shall be the Wealth  And when shall the Consequences of that Accession terminate  When I come to discuss the Articles of Trade I shall make it evident That indeed  Scotland  shall grow rich  and so they may without a Ʋnion if you will do them Justice and they persue the just Advantages Nature and Providence dictate to them  That their Riches shall not be our Poverty nor their Encrease any way interrupt or interfere with Ours but rather add to it  Suppose then the Scots to grow rich by the Ʋnion  what shall be the Consequence but this among a thousand others that their Lands shall obtain Improvements and both these shall end in keeping their numerous Hands at home  And whose shall be the Advantage of keeping those thousands of People at home which now fill the Armies and spread the Colonies of all the Nations in  Europe  If the Wealth and Strength of a Nation consists in the Multitude of its Inhabitants what Addition of Strength shall it be to this Nation when the  Scots  shall be kept at home and tempted by the Profits of their Labour to stay where they can live easy which they would always do if they could and if so shall for ever after be your Assistants and Defenders bound by the Bonds of their own Interest  Men never seek their Bread by Arms nor by travelling into Foreign Countries  generally speaking  till some sort of Hardships Want or other Uneasinesses renders them a little desperate and  living hardly at home  they find themselves under Necessity of going abroad to avoid the Meannesses and Difficulties they meet with in theit own Country  Improvements of Land Application to Manufactures Encrease of Trade Fishing Shipping and the like will certainly produce this Effect to  Scotland  that it will kerp their People at home Of which by it self  And whose shall the Advantages of their Numbers be To whom shall their Duty their Power and their Encrease of all kinds revolve but to the Advantage of  England  Some People have had the Vanity to say We are in  England  a Match for the whole World and our Naval Strength will defend us against all Invasion  I pray God we may never find Occasion to put this to the Trial  But without doubt were  Scotland  effectually united to  England  peopled improv'd and strengthen'd as it may  and ought to be  it would in time more than double our Strength and perhaps at last we might be an Overmatch for any single Nation in the World  We do not indeed seek or expect an immediate Addition of Wealth by a Union with the  Scots tho' some are very fond of making the  Scots  seem poorer than they are  But  Additions of Strength  are very good Equivalents and very material to us and as useful to preserve as our Trade is to encrease our Wealth What is it we fight for now in  Europe  Not for Money not to encrease our Wealth  but to preserve that we have already got  If an Addition of  Scotland  does not encrease our Wealth  tho' I do not grant that neither  if it does fortify us to keep and defend what we have already 'tis an Article no wise Man will despise  Scotland  is an inexhaustible Treasure of Men as may be demonstrated by the vast Numbers they have in our Armies and Navy and in the Armies of the  Swede  the  Pole  the  Muscovite  the Emperor  Holland  and  France what might not  England  now do  had she in her Pay all the  Scots  actually in the Service of these Princes where they are daily cutting one anothers Throats and at the Expence of their Country's Impoverishment gain the empty Reputation of being the best Soldiers in the World  This is a Treasure beyond the  Indies  and what  few People know how to value  and it has hitherto been our Happiness that the  Scots  are thus dispeopled and impoverish'd for had the  Scots  been  as rich as they are populous  had they been as well furnish'd with  the Sinews  as they have been with  the Humour  of War had they  as much  Money as  Men  and as much Design upon us as Courage and Bravery to execute we should long ago have sought this Union more eagerness than  we fancy  they seek it now  'Tis therefore without doubt our Interest  to secure these Advantages now  the Particulars of which I shall enter upon when I come to discourse of Improvements in Trade  There are innumerable Advantages which I cannot touch at here on the  Scots  Side as the Increase of  the Estates and Freehold of the Nobility and Gentry  the Increase of their Trade and the bringing their Country into a perfectly  new Posture  both as to the Way and Manner of Living Thriving and growing Rich not to talk of their  Fishing Trade  which is an  India  at their own Door a Treasure sent them from Heaven which they cannot be long so weak to let another Nation rob them of as hitherto they have done  Thus  Peace  both Civil and Religious  Safety Strength  and by Consequence the Increase both of  Trade  and  Wealth  are the immediate general Advantages of this Union to both Nations  I think there should seem but small Occasion after all this to enter upon the Necessity of this Union to either Nation Advantages are real Necessities and it may very properly be said We cannot be without that which we cannot be without but to our great Loss and Inconvenience  I have not touch'd the Article of the Succession yet nor have I room for it here I am fully of Opinion and belive I reflect on neither Nation if I say The Consequence of the present Dispute between the Nations must be a firm effectual Union or an open declar'd Rupture and I would only tell those Gentlemen who too hastily declare for the latter that I could bring a great many Reasons to prove that if ever this Matter should break out into a War it will be the most bloody implacable and cruel that ever happen'd between the Nations The  Scots  are poor and that may be allow'd beyond what we pretend to but there are such Circumstances attending  Scotland  and which render her a Nation which the other Powers of  Europe  will so gladly espouse that we have unforeseen Events to encounter with in such a Breach and they judge with small Discretion that pretend to account for the Consequences▪ But I hope this Head is needless to inlarge upon  I shall conclude this Tract  which I design chiefly as an Introduction to the Work and useful to prepare the Minds of the People to entertain the grateful Notion of General Union with  laying down the Scheme of my farther Design in which if I have leisure to pursue it I shall attempt to examine the Terms of Union which the Nature of Things and Circumstances of both the Nations seem to lead us directly upon  I shall not undertake to examine the imperfect Schemes of other Men nor assume the Vanity of being arriv'd to a Perfection in my own I know there are Difficulties in a Thing so Nice and where Prerogatives and Priviledges both of Prince and People seem to clash where Emulations in Families Honours Trade and Circumstances of State seem immovable and Differences and Animosities of Religion and Parties have run high  But a Propensity in both Sides to Union a Sense of mutual Advantages and a View of the absolute Necessity of a Union will remove abundance of these Difficulties  Trifles must not stand in the Way of superior Peace and Things are justly call'd Trifles with respect to Nations and the weighty Concerns of the Blood of Ages that are otherwise in themselves considerable  I know some People are very fond of what they call a Federal Union and abundance of Considerations move them to it tho' I believe the greatest Reason most of them can give is because they cannot see thro' another and think a general intire or incorporate Union impracticable or at least that they think both Nations will not come up to it  I shall prescribe nothing but endeavour to show how both are feasible and lay open the Articles of either as plain as I can  The HEADS now to be treated of with respect to this Union I take to be Three RELIGION STATE and TRADE and if in all these I can by Enquiry find out such Mediums as may to the mutual Advantages of both Nations amount to a Settlement I cannot but think we ought not to fall out about the Enqu  y Whether those Advantages may seem to be more to one Nation than another  And should that be the unkind Debate the Gentlemen that raise it will have this Misfortune that in all the Three Articles mentioned the Ballance of Advantage shall turn on our Side and against their pretended Exceptions which I make no question to prove even in the Article of TRADE it self in which some People are so very clamorous  FINIS
