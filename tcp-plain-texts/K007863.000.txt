 THE ROYAL VISION IN AN ODE TO PEACE BY HENRY JONES Author of the EARL OF ESSEX KEW GARDEN c  DUBLIN Printed for WILLIAM WATSON Bookseller at the Poets Heads in Capelstreet  M DCC LXIII  THE ROYAL VISION  THE mighty God of armies bows his ear  To wailing mankind's moan  The Lord of Hosts from heav'n looks down  No more with awful eye severe  He hears the bleeding nations groan  He sees the vanquish'd fall the victor frown  He turns aside his face  By pity touch'd and godlike grace  He calls BRITANNIA's guardian angel loud  Go quell the sanguine and assuage the proud  Thy glorious lot on yonder orb below  That globe shall rule my laurel there shall grow  Arrest the rapid bolt beat down the mortal steel  For man laid waste my tender mercies feel  He said and pointed to the bless'd around  The gasping soldier and the gushing wound  With human nature fainting on the ground  The bless'd themselves seem'd sad that space  And begg'd that mankind might have peace  Go forth my strength thy mighty wings outspread  Yon crimson guilty banners tread  Beneath the foot of peace he said  And sheath oh sheath the murd'rous sword  This olive from thy radiant wing  That near my mercyseat still grows  In GEORGE's breast make joyful spring  And with it wast my world creating word  Let famine pestilence and slaughter cease  'Tis my command give weeping EUROPE peace  And let her angry kings no more be foes  With loud hosannas heav'ns eternal concave rung  And halleluiahs to the God of peace were sung  Th' obedient angel cleaves th' ethereal skies  To GEORGE's downy pillow straight he flies  When balmy slumbers closed his happy eyes  And on the organs of his fancy wrought  The inmost fibres of his feeling heart  With mystic sketch divine angelic trace  Before his melting mental eye he spread  The sick the wounded dying and the dead  The burning city sack'd the raging battle fought  In hideous groupes by form creating art  With all the barb'rous mischiefs that deface  The works of God since CAIN his brother slew  He placed before his visionary view  The infant sprawling on the soldier's spear  Or clinging to the murther'd mother's breast  Whose face retains a tenderness in death  What heart of flesh a sight like this can bear  See for her babe she looks ev'n now distress'd  Her swelling sorrows seem to give her breath  How agonizing fear her features fix  Lest with her flowing blood her milk should mix  The venerable sire see by the hoary hairs  Athwart the pavement dragg'd that floats in blood  The dagger through the matrons bosom thrust  Who 'twixt the murd'rer and her husband stood  The screaming daughter mad her tresses tears  When ravish'd at her gasping mother's feet  Whilst fury blood and lust  Polute each guilty street  As if some fiend had snatch'd the love of kind  And hell itself was lodg'd within the human mind  There mines and caves of death their entrails burst  At one infernal blast one horrid blow accurst  See limbs and heads of men and bodies fly  Like whirling feathers scatter'd thro' the frighted sky  There wrapt in smoke in sulphur stench and fire  Whole armies in th' astonish'd air expire  But those alas are scenes of single woe  Behold vast empires fall at one destructive blow  The king lamented inly as he slept  With tender throbs for murder'd mankind wept  When straight before his eye the angel plac'd  Those human fiends that lay all nature waste  Ambition in the guilty front was there  Who tortures heav'n and earth and sea and air  And tyranny with smiling frown  Whose iron rod seems deck'd in down  Discord in human gore deep dy'd  With fire and water at her side  Her hostile visage with itself at war  Inverted eyes that glare and horrid brows that jar  And bigotry in meek disguise  With dagger'd hand and upcast eyes  And envy daughter of despair  With palid lip and ghastly air  Who copies from tormented fiends her face  The pest of hell and bane of human race  And pride that parent of th' infernal crew  With haughty eye askance and sanguine hue  All these were martial'd in their dread array  And horrid attributes before his eye  The monarch startled as in sleep he lay  And from his inmost soul upheav'd a sigh  The angel now with pow'r serene  All gracious chang'd the horrid scene  A milder vision gently drew  The kings of EUROPE in his view  With lifted hands and bended knees  Imploring peace he pitying sees  The christian virtues all around  Were kneeling near him on the ground  Religion mounted mild up to her sacred place  Sublime she rose awful with heav'nly grace  That whiterob'd queen of sweet command  Still near his bestlov'd throne and heart would stand  The cross erect in one seraphic hand  She held before the royal eye  His love immense that would for mankind die  A precious crown by purest virtue won  Richer than rubies brighter than the sun  Where twice ten thousand various gems unite  Their trembling rays in one celestial light  Her other hand divine holds up to view  The horrid vices dazzled at the glorious sight  Sunk down at once to hell's eternal night  Whilst ravag'd realms and sea and air look new  Bid mankind smile whom heav'n ordains  To bind EUROPA's bleeding veins  Religion said bid discord cease  And open wide the gates of peace  Call back that precious dove my son proceed  Compleat the god like work behold thy glorious meed  With seraphs thron'd thy diadem shall shine  This crown to all eternity is thine  Let christian kings in christian leagues agree  And give the human heart to God and me  The king bid EUROPE's prostrate monarchs rise  Whilst tears of pity from his flowing eyes  Ran trickling down his crimson cheek  Religion made him mild and meek  And half his soul consented  He bad the weeping world rejoyce  With intellectual voice  And ev'ry manly faculty relented  CAESAR himself might now give o'er  Conquest has her fill  A christian monarch should do more  Forbear the christian blood to spill  Let glory hide her guilty rays  Be mercy now my highest praise  Let me my foes forgive  Arise ye vanquish'd monarchs rise and live  The social angel when by pity press'd  That moment lodg'd the heav'nly olive in his breast  And fill'd his heart with clemency and grace  The king awoke he will'd and all was peace  HENRY JONES
