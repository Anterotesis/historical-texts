Rara temporum felicitas ubi sentire quae velis quae sentias dicere licet  Tacit  _THE Arguments of an Author lose a great deal of their Weight when we are persuaded that he only writes for Argument's sake and has no real Concern in the Cause which he espouses This is the Case of one who draws his Pen in the Defence of Property without having any except perhaps in the Copy of a Libel or a Ballad One is apt to suspect that the Passion for Liberty which appears in a Grubstreet Patriot arises only from his Apprehensions of a Gaol and that whatever he may pretend he does not write to secure but to get something of his Own Should the Government be  overturn'd he has nothing to lose but an old Standish  I question not but the Reader will conceive a Respect for the Author of this Paper from the Title of it since he may be sure I am so considerable a Man that I cannot have less than forty Shillings a Year  I have rather chosen this Title than any other because it is what I most glory in and what most effectually calls to my Mind the Happiness of that Government under which I live As a  British  FreeHolder I should not scruple taking place of a  French  Marquis and when I see one of my Countreymen amusing himself in his little CabbageGarden I naturally look upon him as a greater Person than the Owner of the richest Vineyard in  Champagne  The House of Commons is the Representative of Men in my Condition I consider my self as one who give my Consent to every Law which passes A FreeHolder in our Government being of the Nature of a Citizen of  Rome  in that famous Commonwealth who by the Election of a Tribune had a kind of remote Voice in every Law that was enacted So that a Freeholder is but one Remove from a Legislator and for that Reason ought to stand up in the Defence of those Laws which are in some degree of his own making For such is the Nature of our happy Constitution that the Bulk of the People virtually give their Approbation to every thing they are bound to obey and prescribe to themselves those Rules by which they are to walk  At the same time that I declare I am a Freeholder I do not exclude my self from any other Title A FreeHolder may be either a  Voter or a Knight of the Shire a Wit or a Foxhunter a Scholar or a Soldier an Alderman or a Courtier a Patriot or a StockJobber But I chuse to be distinguish'd by this Denomination as the FreeHolder is the Basis of all other Titles Dignities may be grafted upon it but this is the substantial Stock that conveys to them their Life Taste and Beauty and without which they are no more than Blossoms that would fall away with every Shake of Wind  And here I cannot but take occasion to congratulate my Countrey upon the Increase of this happy Tribe of Men since by the Wisdom of the present Parliament I find the Race of FreeHolders spreading into the remotest Corners of the Island I mean that Act which pass'd in the late Session for the Encouragement of Loyalty in  Scotland  By which it is provided  That all and every Vassal and Vassals in  Scotland  who shall continue peaceable and in dutiful Allegiance to His Majesty His Heirs and Successors holding Lands or Tenements of any Offender  guilty of HighTreason  who holds such Lands or Tenements immediately of the Crown shall be vested and seized and are hereby enacted and ordained to hold the said Lands or Tenements of His Majesty His Heirs and Successors in Fee and Heritage for ever by such manner of holding as any such Offender held such Lands or Tenements of the Crown  c  By this Means it will be in the Power of a Highlander to be at all times a good Tenant without being a Rebel and to deserve the Character of a faithful Servant without thinking himself obliged to follow his Master to the Gallows  How can we sufficiently extol the Goodness of His present Majesty who is not willing to have a single Slave in his Dominions Or enough rejoice in the Exercise of that Loyalty which instead of betraying a Man into the most ignominious Servitude as it does in some of our neighbouring Kingdoms entitles him to the highest Privileges of Freedom and Property It is now to be hoped that we shall have few Vassals but to the Laws of our Countrey  When these Men have a Taste of Property they will naturally love that Constitution from which they derive so great a Blessing There is an unspeakable Pleasure in calling any thing one's Own A FreeHold tho' it be but in Ice and Snow will make the Owner pleased in the Possession and stout in the Defence of it and is a very proper Reward of our Allegiance to our present King who by an unparallel'd Instance of Goodness in a Sovereign and Infatuation in Subjects contends for the Freedom of his People against themselves and will not suffer many of them to fall into a State of Slavery which they are bent upon with so much Eagerness and Obstinacy  A FreeHolder of  Great Britain  is bred with an Aversion to every thing that tends to bring him under a Subjection to the arbitrary Will of another Of this we find frequent Instances in all our Histories where the Persons whose Characters are the most amiable and strike us with the highest Veneration are those who stood up manfully against the Invasions of Civil Liberty and the complicated Tyranny which Popery imposes upon our Bodies our Fortunes and our Minds What a despicable Figure then must the present MockPatriots make in the Eyes  of Posterity who venture to be hang'd drawn and quartered for the Ruin of those Civil Rights which their Ancestors rather than part with chose to be cut to Pieces in the Field of Battel And what an Opinion will after Ages entertain of Their Religion who bid fair for a Gibbet by endeavouring to bring in a Superstition which their Forefathers perished in Flames to keep out  But how instructive soever the Folly of these Men may prove to future Times it will be my Business more immediately to consult the Happiness of the Age in which I live And since so many profligate Writers have endeavoured to varnish over a bad Cause I shall do all in my Power to recommend a good One which indeed requires no more than barely to explain what it is While many of my gallant Countreymen are employed in pursuing Rebels half discomfited through the Consciousness of their Guilt I shall labour to improve those Victories to the Good of my FellowSubjects by carrying on our Successes over the Minds of Men and by reconciling them to the Cause of their King their Countrey and their Religion  To this End I shall in the Course of this Paper to be published every  Monday  and  Friday  endeavour to open the Eyes of my Countreymen to their own Interest to shew them the Privileges of an  English  FreeHolder which they enjoy in common with my self and to make them sensible how these Blessings are secured to us by his Majesty's Title his Administration and his Personal Character  I have only one Request to make to my Readers that they will peruse these Papers with the same Candour and Impartiality in which they are  written and shall hope for no other Prepossession in favour of them than what one would think should be natural to every Man a Desire to be happy and a good Will towards those who are the Instruments of making them so  No Monday December  Non de Demino sed de Parente loquimur Intelligamus ergo bona nostra dignosque nos illius usu probemus atque identidem cogitemus si majus principibus praestemus obsequium qui servitute civium quam qui libertate laetantur  Plin  HAving in my first Paper set forth the Happiness of my Station as a FreeHolder of  Great Britain  and the Nature of that Property which is secured to me by the Laws of my Countrey I cannot forbear considering in the next place That Person who is entrusted with the Guardianship and Execution of those Laws I have lived in one Reign when the Prince instead of invigorating the Laws of our Countrey or giving them their proper Course assum'd a Power of dispensing with them And in another when the Sovereign was flattered by a Set of Men into a Persuasion that the Regal Authority was unlimited and uncircumscribed In either of these Cases good Laws are at best but a dead Letter and by shewing the People how happy they ought to be only serve to aggravate the Sense of their Oppressions  We have the Pleasure at this Time to see a King upon the Throne who hath too much  Goodness to wish for any Power that does not enable Him to promote the Welfare of His Subjects and too much Wisdom to look upon those as His Friends who would make their Court to Him by the Profession of an Obedience which they never practised and which has always proved fatal to those Princes who have put it to the Trial His Majesty gave a Proof of His Sovereign Virtues before He came to the Exercise of them in this Kingdom His Inclination to Justice led Him to rule His  German  Subjects in the same Manner that our Constitution directs Him to govern the  English  He regarded those which are our Civil Liberties as the natural Rights of Mankind and therefore indulged them to a People who pleaded no other Claim to them than from His known Goodness and Humanity This Experience of a good Prince before we had the Happiness to enjoy Him must give great Satisfaction to every thinking Man who considers how apt Sovereignty is to deprave human Nature and how many of our own Princes made very ill Figures upon the Throne who before they ascended it were the Favourites of the People  What gives us the greatest Security in the Conduct of so excellent a Prince is That Consistency of Behaviour whereby He inflexibly pursues those Measures which appear the most just and equitable As He hath the Character of being the most prudent in laying proper Schemes He is no less remarkable for being steady in accomplishing what He has once concerted Indeed if we look into the History of His present Majesty and reflect upon that wonderful Series of Successes which have attended Him I think they cannot be ascribed to any thing so  much as to this Uniformity and Firmness of Mind which has always discovered it self in His Proceedings It was by This that He surmounted those many Difficulties which lay in the Way to His Succession and by which we have reason to hope He will daily make all Opposition fall before Him The fickle and unsteady Politicks of our late  British  Monarchs have been the perpetual Source of those Dissentions and Animosities which have made the Nation unhappy Whereas the constant and unshaken Temper of His present Majesty must have a natural Tendency to the Peace of His Government and the Unanimity of His People  Whilst I am enumerating the publick Virtues of our Sovereign which are so conducive to the Advantage of those who are to obey Him I cannot but take Notice that His Majesty was bred up from His Infancy with a Love to this our Nation under a Princess who was the most accomplished Woman of her Age and particularly famous for her Affection to the  English  Our Countreymen were dear to Him before there was any Prospect of their being His Subjects and every one knows that nothing recommended a Man so much to the distinguishing Civilities of His Court as the being born in  Great Britain  To the Fame of His Majesty's Civil Virtues we may add the Reputation He has acquired by His Martial Atchievements It is observed by Sir  William Temple  that the  English  are particuly fond of a King who is Valiant Upon which Account His Majesty has a Title to all the Esteem that can be paid the most Warlike Prince tho' at the same time for the Good of His Subjects He studies to decline all Occasions of  Military Glory and chuses rather to be distinguished as the Father than as the Captain of His People I am glad his rebellious Subjects are too inconsiderable to put him upon exerting that Courage and Conduct which raised him so great a Reputation in  Hungary  and the  Morea  when he fought against the Enemies of Christianity and in  Germany  and  Flanders  where he commanded against the great Disturber of the Peace of  Europe  One would think there was Reason for the Opinion of those who make Personal Courage to be an Hereditary Virtue when we see so many Instances of it in the Line of  Brunswick  To go no farther back than the Time of our present King where can we find among the Soveraign Houses of  Europe  any other Family that has furnished so many Persons of distinguished Fortitude Three of His Majesty's Brothers have fallen gloriously in the Field fighting against the Enemies of their Native Countrey And the Bravery of his Royal Highness the Prince of  Wales  is still fresh in our Memory who fought with the Spirit of his Father at the Battel of  Audenarde  when the Children of  France  and the Pretender fled before him  I might here take Notice of His Majesty's more private Virtues but have rather chosen to remind my Countreymen of the publick Parts of His Character which are supported by such incontestable Facts as are universally known and acknowledged  Having thus far consider'd our Happiness in His Majesty's Civil and Military Character I cannot forbear pleasing my self with regarding him in the View of One who has been always Fortunate  Cicero  recommends  Pompey  under  this particular Head to the  Romans  with whom the Character of being Fortunate was so popular that several of their Emperors gave it a Place among their Titles Good Fortune is often the Reward of Virtue and as often the Effect of Prudence And whether it proceeds from either of these or from both together or whatever may be the Cause of it every one is naturally pleased to see his Interests conducted by a Person who is Used to good Success The Establishment of the Electoral Dignity in His Majesty's Family was a Work reserved for him finally to accomplish A large Accession of Dominion fell to Him by His succeeding to the Dukedom of  Zell  whereby He became one of the Greatest Princes of  Germany  and one of the most powerful Persons that ever stood next Heirs to the Throne of  Great Britain  The Dutchy of  Bremen  and the Bishoprick of  Osnaburg  have considerably strengthned his Interests in the Empire and given a great additional Weight to the Protestant Cause But the most remarkable Interpositions of Providence in favour of him have appeared in removing those seemingly invincible Obstacles to his Succession in taking away at so critical a Juncture the Person who might have proved a dangerous Enemy in confounding the secret and open Attempts of his traiterous Subjects and in giving him the delightful prospect of transmitting his Power through a numerous and stillincreasing Progeny  Upon the whole it is not to be doubted but every wise and honest Subject will concur with Providence in promoting the Glory and Happiness of His present Majesty who is endowed with all those Royal Virtues that will naturally  secure to us the national Blessings which ought to be dear and valuable to a free People  No Friday December  Quibus otio vel magnifice vel molliter vivere copia erat incerta pro certis bellum quam pacem malebant  Sall  EVERY one knows that it is usual for a  French  Officer who can Write and Read to set down all the Occurrences of a Campaign in which he pretends to have been Personally concern'd and to publish them under the Title of his  Memoirs  when most of his FellowSoldiers are dead that might have contradicted any of his Matters of Fact Many a gallant young Fellow has been killed in Battel before he came to the third Page of his secret History when several who have taken more care of their Persons have lived to fill a whole Volume with their military Performances and to astonish the World with such Instances of their Bravery as had escaped the Notice of every Body else One of our late  Preston  Heroes had it seems resolved upon this Method of doing himself Justice And had he not been nipp'd in the Bud might have made a very formidable Figure in his own Works among Posterity A Friend of mine who had the Pillage of his Pockets has made me a Present of the following Memoirs which he desires me to accept as a Part of the Spoils of the Rebels I  have omitted the Introduction as more proper for the Inspection of a Secretary of State and shall only set down so much of the Memoirs as seem to be a faithful Narrative of that won+derful Expedition which drew upon it the Eyes of all  Europe  'HAving thus concerted Measures for a Rising we had a general Meeting over a Bowl of Punch It was here proposed by one of the Wisest among us to draw up a Manifesto setting forth the Grounds and Motives of our taking Arms For as he observed there had never yet been an Insurrection in  England  where the Leaders had not thought themselves obliged to give some Reasons for it To this End we laid our Heads together to consider what Grievances the Nation had suffered under the Reign of King  George  After having spent some Hours upon this Subject without being able to discover any we unanimously agreed to Rebel first and to find out Reasons for it afterwards It was indeed easy to guess at several Grievances of a private Nature which influenced particular Persons One of us had spent his Fortune Another was a younger Brother A third had the Incumbrance of a Father upon his Estate But that which principally disposed us in favour of the Chevalier was that most of the Company had been obliged to take the Abjuration Oath against their Will Being at length thoroughly enflamed with Zeal and Punch we resolved to take Horse the next Morning which we did accordingly having been joined by a considerable Reinforcement of  Roman Catholicks  whom we could rely  upon as knowing them to be the best  Tories  in the Nation and avow'd Enemies to  Presbyterianism  We were likewise joined by a very useful Associate who was a Fidler by Profession and brought in with him a Body of lusty young Fellows whom he had tweedled into the Service About the third Day of our March I was made a Colonel tho' I must need say I gained my Commission by my Horse's Virtues not my own having leapt over a sixbar Gate at the Head of the Cavalry My General who is a discerning Man hereupon gave me a Regiment telling me  He did not question but I would do the like when I came to the Enemies Palisadoes  We pursued our March with much Intrepidity thro' two or three open Towns to the great Terror of the Market People and the Miscarriage of half a Dozen bigbelly'd Women Notwithstanding the Magistracy was generally against us we could discover many Friends among our Spectators particularly in two or three Balconies which were filled with several tawdry Females who are known in that Countrey by the ancient Name of  Harlots  This Sort of Ladies received us every where with great Demonstrations of Joy and promised to assist us with their Prayers After these signal Successes in the North of  England  it was thought advisable by our General to proceed towards our  Scotch  Confederates During our first Day's March I amused my self with considering what Post I should accept of under  James  the Third when we had put him in Possession of the  British  Dominions Being a great Lover of Countrey Sports I absolutely determined not  to be a Minister of State nor to be fobb'd off with a Garter till at length passing by a noble CountreySeat which belongs to a  Whig  I resolved to beg it and pleased myself the Remainder of the Day with several Alterations I intended to make in it For though the Situation was very delightful I neither liked the Front of the House nor the Avenues that led to it We were indeed so confident of Success that I found most of my FellowSoldiers were taken up with Imaginations of the same Nature There had like to have been a Duel between two of our Subalterns upon a dispute which of them should be Governour of  Portsmouth  A  Popish  Priest about the same Time gave great Offence to a  Northumberland  Squire whom he threatned to Excommunicate if he did not give up to him the ChurchLands which his Family had usurped ever since the Reformation In short every Man had cut out a Place for himself in his own Thoughts so that I could reckon up in our little Army two or three LordTreasurers half a Dozen Secretaries of State and at least a Score of Lords Justices in Eyre for each Side of  Trent  We pursued our March thro' several Villages which we drank dry making Proclamation at our Entrance in the Name of  James  the Third against all Concealments of Ale or Brandy Being very much fatigued with the Action of a whole Week it was agreed to rest on  Sunday  when we heard a most excellent Sermon Our Chaplain insisted principally upon Two Heads Under the First he proved to us that the Breach of Publick Oaths is no Perjury And under the Second expounded to us the Nature of NonResistance  which might be interpreted from the  Hebrew  to signify either Loyalty or Rebellion according as the Soveraign bestowed his Favours and Preferments He concluded with exhorting us in a most pathetick Manner to Purge the Land by Wholesome Severities and to Propagate Sound Principles by Fire and Sword We set forward the next Day towards our Friends at  Kelso  but by the Way had like to have lost our General and some of our most active Officers For a Fox unluckily crossing the Road drew off a considerable Detachment who clapped Spurs to their Horses and pursued him with Whoops and Hollows till we had lost Sight of them A Covey of Patridges springing in our Front put our Infantry in Disorder on the same Day It was not long after this that we were joined by our Friends from the other Side of the  Frith  Upon the Junction of the Two Corps our Spies brought us Word that they discovered a great Cloud of Dust at some distance upon which we sent out a Party to Reconnoitre They returned to us with Intelligence that the Dust was raised by a great Drove of Black Cattel This News was not a little welcome to us the Army of both Nations being very Hungry We quickly formed ourselves and received Orders for the Attack with positive Instructions to give no Quarter Every thing was executed with somuch good Order that we made a very plentiful Supper We had three Days after the same Success against a Flock of Sheep which we were forced to eat with great Precipitation having received Advice of General  Carpenter  's March as we were at Dinner Upon  this Alarm we made incredible Stretches towards the South with a Design to gain the Fastnesses of  Preston  We did little remarkable in our Way except setting Fire to a few Houses and frighting an old Woman into Fits We had now got a long Day's March of the Enemy and meeting with a considerable Refreshment of  October  all the Officers assembled over it among whom were several  Popish  Lords and Gentlemen who toasted many loyal Healths and Confusions and wept very plentifully for the Danger of the Church We sat till Midnight and at our Parting resolved to give the Enemy Battel but the next Morning changed our Resolutions and prosecuted our March with indefatigable Speed We were no sooner arrived upon the Frontiers of  Cumberland  but we saw a great Body of Militia drawn up in Array against us Orders were given to Halt and a Council of War was immediately called wherein we agreed with that great Unanimity which was so remarkable among us on these Occasions to make a Retreat But before we could give the Word the Trainbands taking Advantage of our Delay fled first We arrived at  Preston  without any memorable Adventure where after having formed many Barricades and prepared for a vigorous Resistance upon the Approach of the King's Troops under General  Wills  who was used to the Outlandish Way of making War we thought it high Time to put in Practice that PassiveObedience in which our Party so much glories and which I wou'd advise them to stick to for the future'  Such was the End of this Rebellion which in all Probability will not only tend to the Safety of our Constitution but the Preservation of the Game  No Monday January  Ne se mulier extra virtutum cogitationes extraque bellorum casus putet ipsis incipientis matrimonii auspiciis admonetur venire se laborum periculorumque sociam idem in pace idem in praelio passuram ausuramque Sic vivendum sic pereundum  Tacit  IT is with great Satisfaction I observe that the Women of our Island who are the most eminent for Virtue and good Sense are in the Interest of the present Government As the fair Sex very much recommend the Cause they are engaged in it would be no small Misfortune to a Soveraign tho' he had all the Male Part of the Nation on his Side if he did not find himself King of the most beautiful Half of his Subjects Ladies are always of great use to the Party they espouse and never fail to win over Numbers to it Lovers according to Sir  William Petty  's Computation make at least the Third Part of the fencible Men of the British Nation and it has been an uncontroverted Maxim in all Ages that though a Husband is sometimes a stubborn Sort of a Creature a Lover is always at the Devotion of his Mistress By this means it lies in the Power of every fine Woman to secure at least half a Dozen ablebodied Men to His Majesty's Service The  Female World are likewise indispensably necessary in the best Causes to manage the Controversial Part of them in which no Man of tolerable Breeding is ever able to refute them Arguments out of a pretty Mouth are unanswerable  It is indeed remarkable that the Inferiour Tribe of common Women who are a Dishonour to their Sex have in most Reigns been the profess'd Sticklers for such as have acted in Opposition to the true Interest of the Nation The most numerous Converts in King  James  's Reign were particularly noted to be of this kind I can give no other Reason for such a Behaviour unless it be that it is not for the Advantage of these Female Adventurers the Laws of the Land should take Place and that they know  Bridewell  is a Part of our Constitution  There are many Reasons why the Women of  Great Britain  shou'd be on the Side of the Freeholder and Enemies to the Person who would bring in Arbitrary Government and Popery As there are several of our Ladies who amuse themselves in the reading of Travels they cannot but take Notice what uncomfortable Lives those of their own Sex lead where PassiveObedience is professed and practis'd in its utmost Perfection In those Countries the Men have no Property but in their Wives who are the Slaves to Slaves every married Woman being subject to a domestick Tyrant that requires from her the same Vassalage which he pays to his Sultan If the Ladies would seriously consider the evil Consequences of arbitrary lower they would find that it spoils the Shape of the Foot in  China  where the barbarous  Politicks of the Men so diminish the Basis of the Female Figure as to unqualify a Woman for an Evening Walk or Countrey Dance In the  East Indies  a Widow who has any Regard to her Character throws her self into the Flames of her Husband's Funeral Pile to shew forsooth that she is faithful and loyal to the Memory of her deceased Lord In  Persia  the Daughters of  Eve  as they call them are reckoned in the Inventory of their Goods and Chattels and it is a usual Thing when a Man sells a Bale of Silk or a Drove of Camels to toss half a dozen Women into the Bargain Thro' all the Dominions of the Great  Turk  a Woman thinks her self happy if she can get but the twelfth Share of a Husband and is thought of no manner of use in the Creation but to keep up a proper Number of Slaves for the Commander of the Faithful I need not set forth the ill Usage which the fair Ones meet with in those despotick Governments that lie nearer us Every one hath heard of the several Ways of locking up Women in  Spain  and  Italy  where if there is any Power lodged in any of the Sex it is not among the young and the beautiful whom Nature seems to have formed for it but among the old and wither'd Matrons known by the frightful Name of  Gouvernantes  and  Duegna  's If any should alledge the Freedoms indulged to the French Ladies he must own that these are owing to the natural Gallantry of the People not to their Form of Government which excludes by its very Constitution every Female from Power as naturally unfit to hold the Sceptre of that Kingdom  Women ought in reason to be no less averse to Popery than to arbitrary Power Some  merry Authors have pretended to demonstrate that the  Roman Catholick  Religion could never spread in a Nation where Women would have more Modesty than to expose their innocent Liberties to a Confessor Others of the same Turn have assured us that the fine  British  Complection which is so peculiar to our Ladies would suffer very much from a FishDiet And that a whole  Lent  would give such a Sallowness to the celebrated Beauties of this Island as would scarce make them distinguishable from those of  France  I shall only leave to the serious Consideration of my CountreyWomen the Danger any of them might have been in had Popery been our National Religion of being forced by their Relations to a State of perpetual Virginity The most blooming Toast in the Island might have been a Nun and many a Lady who is now a Mother of fine Children condemned to a Condition of Life disagreeable to herself and unprofitable to the World To this I might add the melancholy Objects they would be daily entertained with of several sightly Men delivered over to an inviolable Celibacy Let a young Lady imagine to herself the brisk embroidered Officer who now makes Love to her with so agreeable an Air converted into a Monk or the Bea  who now addresses himself to her in a full bottom'd Wig distinguished by a little bald Pat  covered with a black Leather SkullCap  forbear to mention many other Objections▪ which the Ladies who are no Strangers to th  Doctrines of Popery will easily recollect Th  I do not in the least doubt but those I hav  already suggested will be sufficient to persuad  my fair Readers to be zealous in the Protesta  Cause  The Freedom and Happiness of our  British  Ladies is so singular that it is a common Saying in foreign Countries  If a Bridge were built cross the Seas all the Women in  Europe  would flock into  England It has been observed that the Laws relating to them are so favourable that one would think they themselves had given Votes in enacting them All the Honours and Indulgences of Society are due to them by our Customs and by our Constitution they have all the Privileges of  English  born Subjects without the Burdens I need not acquaint my fair FellowFreeholders that every Man who is anxious for our sacred and civil Rights is a Champion in their Cause since we enjoy in common a Religion agreeable to that reasonable Nature of which we equally partake and since in Point of Property our Law makes no Distinction of Sexes  We may therefore justly expect from them that they will act in concert with us for the Preservation of our Laws and Religion which cannot subsist but under the Government of His present Majesty and would necessarily be subverted under that of a Person bred up in the most violent Principles of Popery and arbitrary Power Thus may the fair Sex contribute to fix the Peace of a brave and generous People who for many Ages have disdained to bear any Tyranny but theirs and be as famous in History as those illustrious Matrons who in the Infancy of  Rome  reconciled the  Romans  and the  Sabines  and united the two contendng Parties under their new King  No Friday January  Omnium Societatum nulla est gravior nulla cario  quam ea quae cum republica est unicuique nostrum Cari sunt parentes cari liberi propinqui familia+res Sed omnes omnium caritates patria una com plexa est Pro qua quis bonus dubitet morten oppetere si ei sit profuturus  Cic  THere is no greater Sign of a general Decay of Virtue in a Nation than a Want of Zeal in its Inhabitants for the Good of their Countrey This generous and publickspirited Passior has been observed of late Years to languish and grow cold in this our Island where a Party of Men have made it their Business to represent it as chimerical and romantick to destroy in the Minds of the People the Sense of national Glory and to turn into Ridicule our natural and ancient Allies who are united to us by the common interests both of Religion and Policy It may not therefore be unseasonable to recommend to this present Generation the Practice of that Virtue for which their Ancestors were particularly famous and which is call'd  The Love of one's Countrey  This Love to our Countrey as a moral Virtue is a fix'd Disposition of Mind to promote the Safety Welrare and Reputation of the Community in which we are born and of the Constitution under which we are protected Our Obligation to this great Duty may appear to us from several Considerations  In the first Place we may observe that we are directed to it by one of those secret Suggestions of Nature which go under the Name of  Instinct  and which are never given in vain As Selflove is an Instinct planted in us for the Good and Safety of each particular Person the Love of our Countrey is impress'd on our Minds for the Happiness and Preservation of the Community This Instinct is so remarkable that we find Examples of it in those who are born in the most uncomfortable Climates or the worst of Governments We read of an Inhabitant of  Nova Zembla  who after having liv'd some Time in  Denmark  where he was cloath'd and treated with the utmost Indulgence took the first Opportunity of making his Escape tho' with the Hazard of his Life into his native Regions of Cold Poverty and Nakedness We have an Instance of the same Nature among the very  Hottentots  One of these Savages was brought into  England  taught our Language and in a great Measure polish'd out of his natural Barbarity But upon being carry'd back to the Cape of  Good Hope  where it was thought he might have been of Advantage to our  English  Traders he mix'd in a kind of Transport with his Countreymen brutaliz'd with 'em in their Habit and Manners and wou'd never again return to his foreign Acquaintance I need not mention the common Opinion of the  Negroes  in our Plantations who have no other Notion of a future State of Happiness than that after Death they shall be convey'd back to their native Countrey The  Swiss  are so remarkable for this Passion that it often turns to a Disease among them for which there is a particular Name in the  German  Language and which the  French  call  The Distemper of the Countrey  For nothing is mor  usual than for several of their common Soldiers who are listed into a foreign Service to hav  such violent Hankerings after their Home as  pine away even to Death unless they have  Permission to return which on such an Occa…sion is generally granted them I shall onl  add under this Head that since the Love of one'  Countrey is natural to every Man any particula  Nation who by false Politicks shall endeavou  to stifle or restrain it will not be upon a Lev  with others  As this Love of our Countrey is natural to e+very Man so it is likewise very  reasonable  and that in the first Place because it inclines us to be Beneficial to those who are and ought to  dearer to us than any others It takes in ou  Families Relations Friends and Acquaintance  and in short all whose Welfare and Security we are oblig'd to consult more than that  those who are Strangers to us For this Rea…son it is the most sublime and extensive of  social Virtues Especially if we consider that  does not only promote the Wellbeing of these who are our Contemporaries but likewise  their Children and their Posterity Hence it  that all Casuists are unanimous in determining▪ that when the Good of the Countrey interferes even with the Life of the most beloved Relation▪ dearest Friend or greatest Benefactor it is to be preferred without Exception  Farther tho' there is a Benevolence due to all Mankind none can question but a superior Degree of it is to be paid to a Father a Wife or a Child In the same Manner tho' our Love should reach to the whole Species a greater Proportion of it should exert it self towards  that Community in which Providence has placed us This is our proper Sphere of Action the Province allotted to us for the Exercise of all our Civil Virtues and in which alone we have Opportunities of expressing our Good Will to Mankind I cou'd not but be pleas'd in the Accounts of the late  Persian  Embassy into  France  with a particular Ceremony of the Embassador who every Morning before he went abroad religiously saluted a Turf of Earth dug out of his own native Soil to remind him that in all the Transactions of the Day he was to think of his Countrey and pursue its Advantages If in the several Districts and Divisions of the World Men would thus study the Welfare of those respective Communities to which their Power of doing Good is limited the whole Race of reasonable Creatures would be happy as far as the Benefits of Society can make them so At least we find so many Blessings naturally flowing from this noble Principle that in Proportion as it prevails every Nation becomes a prosperous and flourishing People  It may be yet a farther Recommendation of this particular Virtue if we consider that no Nation was ever famous for its Morals which was not at the same Time remarkable for its publick Spirit Patriots naturally rise out of a  Spartan  or  Roman  Virtue And there is no Remark more common among the Antient Historians than that when the State was corrupted with Avarice and Luxury it was in Danger of being Betray'd or Sold  To the foregoing Reasons for the Love which every good Man owes to his Countrey we may add that the Actions which are most celebrated in History and which are read with the greatest  Admiration are such as proceed from this Principle The establishing of good Laws the detecting of Conspiracies the crushing of Seditions and Rebellions the falling in Battel or the devoting of a Man's self to certain Death for the Safety of FellowCitizens are Actions that always warm the Reader and endear to him Persons of the remotest Ages and the most distant Countries  And as Actions that proceed from the Love of one's Countrey are more Illustrious than any other in the Records of Time so we find that those Persons who have been eminent in other Virtues have been particularly distinguished by This It would be endless to produce Example  of this Kind out of  Greek  and  Roman  Authors▪ To confine my self therefore in so wide and beaten a Field I shall choose some Instances from Holy Writ which abounds in Accounts of this Nature as much as any other History whatsoever And this I do the more willingly because in some Books lately written I find it objected against Revealed Religion that it does not inspire the Love of one's Countrey Here I must pr  mise that as the Sacred Author of our Religion chiefly inculcated to the  Jews  those Parts of their Duty wherein they were most defective so there was no Need of insisting upon this The  Jews  being remarkable for an Attachment to their own Countrey even to the Exclusion of all common Humanity to Strangers We see in the Behaviour of this Divine Person the Practice of this Virtue in Conjunction with all others He deferr'd working a Miracle in the Behalf of a  SyroPhoenician  Woman 'till he had declar'd his Superiour GoodWill to his own Nation and was prevail'd upon to heal the Daughter of a  Roman  Centurion by hearing from the  Jews  that he was one who lov'd their Nation and had built them a Synagogue But to look out for no other Instance what was ever more moving than his Lamentation over  Jerusalem  at his first Approach to it notwithstanding he had foretold the cruel and unjust Treatment he was to meet with in that City For he foresaw the Destruction which in a few Years was to fall upon that People a Destruction not to be parallell'd in any Nation from the Beginning of the World to this Day and in the View of it melted into Tears His Followers have in many Places expressed the like Sentiments of Affection for their Countreymen among which none is more extraordinary than that of the great Convert who wish'd he himself might be made a Curse provided it might turn to the Happiness of his Nation or as he words it  Of his Brethren and Kinsmen who are  Israelites This Instance naturally brings to Mind the same Heroick Temper of Soul in the great  Jewish  LawGiver who would have devoted himself in the same Manner rather than see his People perish It would indeed be difficult to find out any Man of extraordinary Piety in the Sacred Writings in whom this Virtue is not highly conspicuous The Reader however will excuse me if I take Notice of one Passage because it is a very fine One and wants only a Place in some Polite Author of  Greece  or  Rome  to have been admired and celebrated The King of  Syria  lying sick upon his Bed sent  Hasael  one of his Great Officers to the Prophet  Elisha  to enquire of him whether he should recover The Prophet look'd so attentively on this Messenger that it put him into some Confusion or to quote this Beautiful Circumstance and the whole Narrative  in the pathetick Language of the Scripture  Elisha settled his Countenance stedfastly upon him until he was ashamed And  Hasael  said why weepeth my Lord    And he said because I know the Evil that thou wilt do unto the Children of  Israel  Their strong Holds wilt thou set on Fire and their Men wilt thou slay with the Sword and wilt dash their Children and rip up their Women with Child And  Hasael  said But what is thy Servant a Dog that he should do this great Thing    And  Elisha  answered The Lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be King over Syria  I might enforce these Reasons for the Love of our Countrey by Considerations adapted to my Readers as they are  Englishmen  and as by that Means they enjoy a purer Religion and a more excellent Form of Government than any other Nation under Heaven But being persuaded that every One must look upon himself as indispensably obliged to the Practice of a Duty which is recommended to him by so many Arguments and Examples I shall only desire the honest wellmeaning Reader when he turns his Thoughts towards the Publick rather to consider what Opportunities he has of doing Good to his Native Countrey than to throw away his Time in deciding the Rights of Princes or the like Speculations which are so far beyond his Reach Let us leave these great Points to the Wisdom of our Legislature and to the Determination of those who are the proper Judges of our Constitution We shall otherwise be liable to the just Reproach which is  such Christians as waste their Lives in the  and intricate Disputes of Religion when they should be practising the Doctrine which it teaches If there be any Right upon Earth any relying on the Judgment of our most  Eminent Lawyers and Divines or indeed any Certainty in human Reason our Present Sovereign has an Undoubted Title to our Duty and Obedience But supposing for Argument's sake that This Right were doubtful and that an  Englishman  could be divided in his Opinion as to the Person to whom he should pay his Allegiance In this Case there is no Question but the Love of his Countrey ought to cast the Ballance and to determine him on that Side which is most conducive to the Welfare of his Community To bring this to our present Case A' Man must be destitute of common Sense who is capable of imagining that the Protestant Religion could flourish under the Government of a Bigotted  RomanCatholick  or that our Civil Rights could be Protected by One who has been trained up in the Politicks of the most Arbitrary Prince in  Europe  and who could not acknowledge his Gratitude to his Benefactor by any remarkable Instance which would not be detrimental to the  British  Nation And are these such desirable Blessings that an honest Man would endeavour to arrive at 'em through the Confusions of a Civil War and the Blood of many Thousands of his FellowSubjects On the contrary the Arguments for our Steady Loyal and Affectionate Adherence to King  GEORGE  are so evident from this single Topick that if every  Briton  instead of A spiring after private Wealth or Power would sincerely desire to make his Countrey happy His Present Majesty would not have a single Malecontent in his whole Dominions  No Monday January  Fraus enim asiringit non dissolvit Perjurium  Cic  AT a Time when so many of the King's Subjects present themselves before their respective Magistrates to take the Oaths required by Law it may not be improper to awaken in the Minds of my Readers a due Sense of the Engagement under which they lay themselves It is a melancholy Consideration that there should be several among us so hardened and deluded as to think an Oath a proper Subject for a Jest and to make this which is one of the most solemn Acts of Religion an Occasion of Mirth Yet such is the Depravation of our Manners at present that nothing is more frequent than to near profligate Men ridiculing to the best of their Abilities these Sacred Pledges of their Duty and Allegiance and endeavouring to be witty upon themselves for daring to prevaricate with God and Man A poor Conceit of their own or a Quotation out of  Hudibras  shall make 'em treat with Levity an Obligation wherein their Safety and Welfare are concern'd both as to this World and the next Raillery of this Nature is enough to make the Hearer tremble As these Miscreants seem to glory in the Profession of their Impiety there is no Man who has any Regard to his Duty or even to his Reputation that can appear in their Defence But if there are Others of a more serious Turn who join with us deliberately in these Religious Professions of Loyalty to our Sovereign with any private Salvo's or Evasions  they would do well to consider those Maxims in which all Casuists are agreed who have gained any Esteem for their Learning Judgment or Morality These have unanimously determined that an Oath is always to be taken in the Sense of that Authority which imposes it And that those whose Hearts do not concur with their Lips in the Form of these publick Protestations or who have any mental Reserves or who take an Oath against their Consciences upon any Motive whatsoever or with a Design to break it or repent of it are guilty of Perjury Any of these or the the like Circumstances instead of alleviating the Crime make it more hainous as they are premediated Frauds which it is the chief Design of an Oath to prevent and the most flagrant instances of Insincerity to Men and Irreverence to their Maker For this Reason the Perjury of a Man who takes an Oath with an Intention to keep it and is afterwards seduced to the Violation of it tho' a Crime not to be thought of without the greatest Horror is yet in some Respects not quite so black as the Perjury abovementioned It is indeed a very unhappy Token of the great Corruption of our Manners that there should be any so inconsiderate among us as to sacrifice the standing and essential Duties of Morality to the Views of Politicks and that as in my last Paper it was no unseasonable to prove the Love of our Countrey to be a Virtue so in this there should be any Occasion to shew that Perjury is a Sin But it is our Misfortune to live in an Age when such wild and unnatural Doctrines have prevailed among some of our FellowSubjects that if One looks into their Schemes of Government they seem according as they are in the Humour to believe that a  Soveraign is not to be restrained by his Coronation Oath or his People by their Oaths of Allegiance Or to represent them in a plainer Light in some Reigns they are both for a Power and an Obedience that is unlimited and in others are for retrenching within the narrowest Bounds both the Authority of the Prince and the Allegiance of the Subject  Now the Guilt of Perjury is so selfevident that it was always reckoned among the greatest Crimes by those who were only govern'd by the Light of Reason The inviolable observing of an Oath like the other practical Duties of Christianity is a Part of Natural Religion As Reason is common to all Mankind the Dictates of it are the same through the whole Species And since every Man's own Heart will tell him that there can be no greater Affront to the Deity whom he worships than to appeal to him with an Intention to deceive nor a greater Injustice to Men than to betray them by false Assurances it is no Wonder that Pagans and Christians Infidels and Believers should concur in a Point wherein the Honour of the Supream Being and the Welfare of Society are so highly concerned For this Reason  Pythagoras  to his first Precept of honouring the Immortal Gods immediately subjoyns that of paying Veneration to an Oath We may see the Reverence which the Heathens shew'd to these Sacred and Solemn Engagements from the Inconveniences which they often suffered rather than break through them We have frequent Instances of this Kind in the  Roman  CommonWealth which as it has been observed by several Eminent  Pagan  Writers very much excell'd all other  Pagan  Governments in the Practice of Virtue How far they exceeded in this Particular  those great Corrupters of Christianity and indeed of Natural Religion the Jesuists may appear from their Abhorrence of every Thing that looked like a fraudulent or mental Evasion Of this I shall only produce the following Instance Several  Romans  who had been taken Prisoners by  Hannibal  were released upon obliging themselves by an Oath to return again to his Camp Among these there was One who thinking to elude the Oath went the same Day back to the Camp on Pretence of having forgot something But this Prevarication was so shocking to the  Roman  Senate that they order'd him to be apprehended and deliver'd up to  Hannibal  We may farther see the just Sense the Heathens had of the Crime of Perjury from the Penalties which they inflicted on the Persons guilty of it Perjury among the  Scythians  was a Capital Crime and among the  Egyptians  also was punished with Death as  Diodorus Siculus  relates who observes that an Offender of this Kind is guilty of those two Crimes wherein the Malignity of Perjury truly consists a failing in his Respect to the Divinity and in his Faith towards Men 'Tis unnecessary to multiply Instances of this Nature which may be found in almost every Author who has written on this Subject  If Men who had no other Guide but their Reason consider'd an Oath to be of such a tremendous Nature and the Violation of it to be so great a Crime it ought to make a much deeper Impression upon Minds enlighten'd by Revealed Religion as they have more exalted Notions of the Divinity A supposed Heathen Deity might be so poor in his Attributes so stinted in his Knowledge Goodness or Power that a Pagan might hope to conceal his Perjury from his  Notice or not to provoke him shou'd he be discover'd or shou'd he provoke him not to be punish'd by him Nay he might have produced Examples of Falshood and Perjury in the Gods themselves to whom he appeal'd But as Revealed Religion has given us a more just and clear Idea of the Divine Nature He whom we appeal to is Truth it self the Great Searcher of Hearts who will not let Fraud and Falshood go unpunished or  hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain  And as with Regard to the Deity so likewise with Regard to Man the Obligation of an Oath is stronger upon Christians than upon any other Part of Mankind and that because Charity Truth mutual Confidence and all other Social Duties are carry'd to greater Heights and enforc'd with stronger Motives by the Principles of our Religion  Perjury with Relation to the Oaths which are at present requir'd of us has in it all the aggravating Circumstances which can attend that Crime We take them before the Magistrates of Publick Justice are reminded by the Ceremony that it is a Part of that Obedience which we learn from the Gospel expressly disavow all Evasions and mental Reservations whatsoever appeal to Almighty God for the Integrity of our Hearts and only desire Him to be our Helper as we fulfil the Oath we there take in His Presence I mention these Circumstances to which several other might be added because it is a received Doctrine among those who have treated of the Nature of an Oath that the greater the Solemnities are which attend it the more they aggravate the Violation of it And here what must be the Success that a Man can hope for who turns a Rebel after having disclaimed the Divine Assistance  but upon Condition of being a Faithful and Loyal Subject He first of all desires that God may help him as he shall keep his Oaths and afterwards hope to prosper in an Enterprize which is the direct Breach of it  Since therefore Perjury by the common Sense of Mankind the Reason of the Thing and from the whole Tenor of Christianity is a Crime of so flagitious a Nature we cannot be too careful in avoiding every Approach towards it  The Virtue of the Ancient  Athenians  is very remarkable in the Case of  Euripides  This great Tragick Poet tho' famous for the Morality of his Plays had introduced a Person who being reminded of an Oath he had taken reply'd  I swore with my Mouth but not with my Heart  The Impiety of this Sentiment set the Audience in an Uproar made  Socrates  tho' an intimate Friend of the Poet go out of the Theatre with Indignation and gave so great Offence that he was publickly accused and brought upon his Tryal as One who had suggested an Evasion of what they thought the most Holy and Indissoluble Bond of human Society So jealous were these Virtuous Heathens of any the smallest Hint that might open a Way to Perjury  And here it highly imports us to consider that we do not only break our Oath of Allegiance by Actual Rebellion but by all those other Methods which have a natural and manifest Tendency to  ▪ The Guilt may lye upon a Man where the Penalty cannot take Hold of him Those who speak irreverently of the Person to whom they have sworn Allegiance who endeavour to alienate from Him the Hearts of His Subjects or to inspire the People with Disaffection to His Government cannot be thought to be true to the  Oath they have taken And as for those who by concerted Falshoods and Defamations endeavour to blemish His Character or weaken His Authority they incur the complicated Guilt both of Slander and Perjury The moral Crime is compleated in such Offenders and there are only accidental Circumstances wanting to work it up for the Cognizance of the Law  Nor is it sufficient for a Man who has given these Solemn Assurances to his Prince to forbear the doing Him any Evil unless at the same Time he do Him all the Good he can in his proper Station of Life  Loyalty is of an Active Nature and ought to discover it self in all the Instances of Zeal and Affection to our Sovereign And if we carefully examine the Duty of that Allegiance which we pledge to His Majesty by the Oaths that are tendred to us we shall find that  We do  not only  renounce refuse and abjure any Allegiance or Obedience to the Pretender  but  Swear to defend King  George  to the utmost of our Power against all Traiterous Conspiracies and Attempts whatsoever and to disclose and make known to His Majesty all Treasons and Traiterous Conspiracies which we shall know to be against Him  To conclude as among those who have bound themselves by these Sacred Obligations the actual Traytor or Rebel is guilty of Perjury in the Eye of the Law the secret Promoter or WellWisher of the Cause is so before the Tribunal of Conscience And tho' I should be unwilling to pronounce the Man who is indolent or indifferent in the Cause of his Prince to be absolutely perjured I may venture to affirm that he falls very short of that Allegiance to which he is obliged by Oath Upon the whole we may be  assured that in a Nation which is tyed down by such Religious and Solemn Engagements the People's Loyalty will keep pace with their Morality and that in Proportion as they are sincere Christians they will be faithful Subjects  No Friday January  Veritas pluribus modis infracta Primum inscitiâ reipublicae ut alienae mox libidine assentandi aut rursus odio adversus dominantes Obtrectatio livor pronis auribus accipiuntur quippe adulationi foedum crimen servitutis malignitati falsa species libertatis inest  Tac  THERE is no greater Sign of a bad Cause than when the Patrons of it are reduced to the Necessity of making use of the most wicked Artifices to support it Of this Kind are the Falshoods and Calumnies which are invented and spread abroad by the Enemies to our King and Countrey This Spirit of Malice and Slander does not discover itself in any Instances so ridiculous as in those by which seditious Men endeavour to depreciate His Majesty's Person and Family without considering that his Court at  Hanover  was always allowed to be one of the Politest in  Europe  and that before he became our King he was reckoned among the greatest Princes of  Christendom  But the most glorious of His Majesty's Predecessors was treated after the same Manner Upon that Prince's first Arrival the inconsiderable Party who then laboured to make him odious  to the People gave out That he brought with him twenty thousand  Laplanders  cloathed in the Skins of Bears all of their own killing and that they mutiny'd because they had not been regaled with a bloody Battel within two Days after their Landing He was no sooner on the Throne than those who had contributed to place him there finding that he had made some Changes at Court which were not to their Humour endeavoured to render him Unpopular by Misrepresentations of his Person his Character and his Actions They found that his Nose had a Resemblance to that of  Oliver Cromwel  and clapt him on a huge Pair of Mustachoes to frighten his People with His Mercy was Fear his Justice was Cruelty his Temperance Oeconomy prudent Behaviour and Application to Business were  Dutch  Virtues and such as we had not been used to in our  English  Kings He did not fight a Battel in which the  Tories  did not slay double the Number of what he had lost in the Field nor ever raised a Siege or gain'd a Victory which did not cost more than 'twas worth In short he was contriving the Ruin of his Kingdom and in order to it advanc'd Dr  Tul  tson  to the highest Station of the Church my Lord  Sommers  of the Law Mr  Mountague  of the Treasury and the Admiral at  la Hegue  of the Fleet Such were the Calumnies of the Party in those Times which we see so faithfully copied out by Men of the same Principles under the Reign of His present Majesty  As the Schemes of these Gentlemen are the most absurd and contradictory to common Sense the Means by which they are promoted must be of the same Nature Nothing but Weakness  and Folly can dispose  Englishmen  and  Protestants  to the Interests of a  Popish Pretender  And the same Abilities of Mind will naturally qualify his Adherents to swallow the most palpable and notorious Falshoods Their selfinterested and designing Leaders cannot desire a more ductile and easy People to work upon How long was it before many of this simple deluded Tribe were brought to believe that the  Highlanders  were a Generation of Men that could be conquer'd The Rabble of the Party were instructed to look upon 'em as so many  Giants  and  Saracens  and were very much surprized to find that every one of 'em had not with his broad Sword mow'd down at least a Squadron of the King's Forces There were not only publick Rejoycings in the Camp at  Perth  but likewise many private Congratulations nearer us among these Wellwishers to their Countrey upon the Victories of their Friends at  Preston  which continued till the Rebels made their solemn Cavalcade from  Highgate  Nay there were then some of these wise Partisans who concluded the Government had hired two or three hundred hale Men who looked like Foxhunters to be Bound and Pinion'd if not to be Executed as Representatives of the pretended Captives Their Victories in  Scotland  have been innumerable and no longer ago than last Week they gained a very remarkable One in which the  Highlanders  cut off all the  Dutch  Forces to a Man and afterwards disguising themselves in their Habits came up as Friends to the King's Troops and put them all to the Sword This Story had a great Run for a Day or two and I believe one might still find out a Whisper among their secret Intelligence that the Duke of  Mar  is actually  upon the Road to  London  if not within two Days march of the Town I need not take Notice that their Successes in the Battel of  Dunblain  are magnified among some of them to this Day though a  Tory  may very well say with King  Pyrrhus    That such another Victory would undo them  But the most fruitful Source of Falshood and Calumny is that which one would think should be the least apt to produce them I mean a pretended Concern for the Safety of our Established Religion Were these People as anxious for the Doctrines which are essential to the Church of  England  as they are for the nominal Distinction of adhering to its Interests they would know that the sincere Observation of publick Oaths Allegiance to their King Submission to their Bishops Zeal against Popery and Abhorrence of Rebellion are the great Points that adorn the Character of the Church of  England  and in which the Authors of the Reformed Religion in this Nation have always gloried We justly reproach the  Jesuits  who have adapted all Christianity to Temporal and Political Views for maintaining a Position so repugnant to the Laws of Nature Morality and Religion That evil may be committed for the sake of Good which may arise from it But we cannot suppose even this Principle as bad a One as it is should influence those Persons who by so many absurd and monstrous Falshoods endeavour to delude Men into a Belief of the Danger of the Church If there be any relying on the solemn Declarations of a Prince famed for keeping his Word constant in the publick Exercises of our Religion and determined in the Maintenance of our Laws we have all the Assurances  that can be given to us for the Security of the established Church under His Government When a leading Man therefore begins to grow apprehensive for the Church you may be sure that he is either in danger of losing a Place or in despair of getting one It is pleasant on these Occasions to see a notorious Profligate seized with a Concern for his Religion and converting his Spleen into Zeal These narrow and selfish Views have so great an Influence in this Cry that among those who call themselves the Landed Interest there are several of my Fellow FreeHolders who always fancy the Church in Danger upon the rising of BankStock But the standing Absurdities without the Belief of which no Man is reckoned a staunch Churchman are That there is a Calves Head Club for which by the way some pious  Tory  has made suitable Hymns and Devotions That there is a Confederacy among the greatest part of the Prelates to destroy Episcopacy and that all who talk against  Popery  are  Presbyterians  in their Hearts The Emissaries of the Party are so diligent in spreading ridiculous Fictions of this Kind that at present if we may credit common Report there are several remote Parts of the Nation in which it is firmly believed that all the Churches in  London  are shut up and that if any Clergyman walks the Streets in his Habit 'tis ten to one but he is knock'd down by some sturdy Schismatick  We may observe upon this Occasion that there are many particular Falshoods suited to the particular Climates and Latitudes in which they are published according as the Situation of the Place makes them less liable to Discovery There is many a Lye that will not thrive within  a hundred Miles of  London  Nay we often find a Lye born in  Southwark  that dies the same Day on this Side the Water And several produced in the loyal Ward of  Portsoken  of so feeble a Make as not to bear Carriage to the  RoyalExchange  However as the Mints of Calumny are perpetually at work there are a great Number of curious Inventions issued out from Time to Time which grow current among the Party and circulate through the whole Kingdom  As the Design of this Paper is not to exasperate but to undeceive my Countreymen let me desire them to consider the many Inconveniencies they bring upon themselves by these mutual Intercourses of Credulity and Falshood I shall only remind the Credulous of the strong Delusion they have by this Means been led into the greatest part of their Lives Their hopes have been kept up by a Succession of Lyes for rear thirty Years How many Persons have starved in Expectation of those profitable Employments which were promised them by the Authors of these Forgeries How many of them have died with great Regret when they thought they were within a Month of enjoying the inestimable Blessings of a Popish and Arbitrary Reign  I would therefore advise this blinded Set of Men not to give Credit to those Persons by whom they have been so often fooled and imposed upon but on the contrary to think it an Affront to their Parts when they hear from any of them such Accounts as they would not dare to tell them but upon the Presumption that they are Ideots Or if the Zeal for the Cause shall dispose them to be Credulous in any Points  that are favourable to it I would beg of them not to venture Wagers upon the Truth of them And in this present Conjuncture by no means to sell out of the Stocks upon any News they shall hear from their good Friends at  Perth  As these Party Fictions are the proper Subjects of Mirth and Laughter their deluded Believers are only to be treated with Pity or Contempt But as for those Incendiaries of Figure and Distinction who are the Inventors and Publishers of such gross Falshoods and Calumnies they cannot be regarded by others but with the utmost Detestation and Abhorrence nor one would think by themselves without the greatest Remorse and Compunction of Heart when they consider that in order to give a Spirit to a desperate Cause they have by their false and treacherous Insinuations and Reports betrayed so many of their Friends into their own Destruction  No Monday January  Adveniet qui vestra dies Muliebribus armis Verbaredargueret  Virg  I Have heard that several Ladies of Distinction upon the Reading of my Fourth Paper are studying Methods how to make themselves useful to the Publick One has a Design of keeping an open TeaTable where every Man shall be welcome that is a Friend to King  George  Another is for setting up an Assembly for Basset where none shall be admitted to  Punt  that  have not taken the Oaths A Third is upon an Invention of a Dress which will put every  Tory  Lady out of Countenance I am not informed of the Particulars but am told in general that she has contrived to shew her Principles by the setting of her Commode so that it will be impossible for any Woman that is  disaffected  to be in the Fashion Some of them are of Opinion that the Fan may be made use of with good Success against Popery by exhibiting the Corruptions of the Church of  Rome  in various Figures and that their Abhorrence of the superstitious Use of Beads may be very aptly expressed in the make of a Pearl Necklace As for the Civil Part of our Constitution it is unanimously agreed among the Leaders of the Sex that there is no Glory in making a Man their Slave who has not naturally a Passion for Liberty and to disallow of all Professions of Passive Obedience but from a Lover to his Mistress  It happens very luckily for the Interest of the  Whigs  that their very Enemies acknowledge the finest Women of  Great Britain  to be of that Party The  Tories  are forced to borrow their Toasts from their Antagonists and can scarce find Beauties enough of their own Side to supply a single Round of  October  One may indeed sometimes discover among the Malignants of the Sex a Face that seems to have been naturally designed for a  Whig  Lady But then it is so often flushed with Rage or sowered with Disappointments that one cannot but be troubled to see it thrown away upon the Owner Would the pretty Malecontent be persuaded to love her King and Countrey it would diffuse a Chearfulness through all her Features and give  her quite another Air I would therefore advise these my gentle Readers as they consult the Good of their Faces to forbear frowning upon Loyalists and Pouting at the Government In the mean Time what may we not hope from a Cause which is recommended by the Allurement of Beauty and the Force of Truth It is therefore to be hoped that every fine Woman will make this laudable Use of her Charms and that she may not want to be frequently reminded of this great Duty I will only desire her to think of her Countrey every Time she looks in her Glass  But because it is impossible to prescribe such Rules as shall be suitable to the Sex in general I shall consider them under their several Divisions of Maids Wives and Widows  As for Virgins who are unexperienced in the Wiles of Men they would do well to consider how little they are to rely on the Faith of Lovers who in less than a Year have broken their Allegiance to their lawful Soveraign and what Credit is to be given to the Vows and Protestations of such as shew themselves so little afraid of Perjury Besides what would an innocent young Lady think should she marry a Man without examining his Principles and afterwards find herself got with Child by a Rebel  In the next Place every Wife ought to answer for her Man If the Husband be ingaged in a seditious Club or drinks mysterious Healths or be frugal of his Candles on a rejoycing Night let her look to him and keep him out of Harms way or the World will be apt to say she has a Mind to be a Widow before her Time She ought in such Cases to exert the Authority of the Curtain Lecture and if she finds him of a  rebellious Disposition to tame him as they do Birds of Prey by dinning him in the Ears all Night long  Widows may be supposed Women of too good Sense not to discountenance all Practices that have a Tendency to the Destruction of Mankind Besides they have a greater Interest in Property than either Maids or Wives and do not hold their Jointures by the precarious Tenure of Portions or PinMoney So that it is as unnatural for a Dowager as a FreeHolder to be an Enemy to our Constitution  As nothing is more Instructive than Examples I would recommend to the Perusal of our  British  Virgins the Story of  Clelia  a  Roman  Spinster whose Behaviour is represented by all their Historians as one of the chief Motives that discouraged the  Tarquins  from prosecuting their Attempt to regain the Throne from whence they had been expelled Let the Marry'd Women reflect upon the Glory acquired by the Wife of  Coriolanus  who when her Husband after long Exile was returning into his Countrey with Fire and Sword diverted him from so cruel and unnatural an Enterprize And let those who have out lived their Husbands never forget their Countreywoman Widow  Boadicia  who headed her Troops in Person against the Invasion of a  Roman  Army and encouraged them with this memorable Saying  I who am a Woman am resolv'd upon Victory or Death But as for you who are Men you may if you please chuse Life and Slavery  But I do not propose to our  British  Ladies that they should turn  Amazons  in the Service of their Soveraign nor so much as let their Nails grow for the Defence of their Countrey The  Men will take the Work of the Field off their Hands and shew the World that  English  Valour cannot be matched when it is animated by  English  Beauty I do not however disapprove the Project which is now on Foot for a  FEMALE ASSOCIATION  and since I hear the fair Confederates cannot agree among themselves upon a Form shall presume to lay before them the following rough Draught to be corrected or improved as they in their Wisdom shall think fit  'WE the Consorts Relicts and Spinsters of the Isle of  Great Britain  whose Name are underwritten being most passionately Offended at the Falshood and Perfidiousness of certain faithless Men and at the Lukewarmth and Indifference of others have entered into a voluntary Association for the Good and Safety of our Constitution And we do hereby engage our selves to raise and arm our Vassals for the Service of His Majesty King  George  and Him to Defend with our Tongues and Hearts our Eyes EyeLashes Favourites Lips Dimples and every other Feature whether natural or acquired We promise publickly and openly to avow the Loyalty of our Principles in every Word we shall utter and every Patch we shall stick on We do farther promise to annoy the Enemy with all the Flames Darts and Arrows with which Nature has armed us never to correspond with them by Sigh Ogle or Billetdoux not to have any Intercourse with them either in Snuff or Tea nor to accept the Civility of any Man's Hand who is not ready to use it in the Defence of his Countrey We  are determined in so good a Cause to endure the greatest Hardships and Severities if there shou'd be Occasion and even to wear the Manufacture of our Countrey rather than appear the Friends of a foreign Interest in the richest  French  Brocade And forgetting all private Feuds Jealousies and Animosities We do unanimously oblige ourselves by this our Association to stand and fall by one another as Loyal and Faithful Sisters and FellowSubjects'  N B  This Association will be lodged at Mr  Motteux  's where Attendance will be given to the Subscribers who are to be ranged in their respective Columns as Maids Wives and Widows  No Friday January  Confilia qui dant prava cautis Hominibus  Et perdunt Operam deridentur turpiter  Phaedr  THOUGH I have already seen in  The TownTalk  a Letter from a Celebrated  English  Man to the Pretender which is indeed an Excellent Answer to His Declaration the Title of this Paper obliges me to publish the following Piece which considers it in different Lights  The Declaration of the FreeHolders of  GreatBritain  in Answer to that of the Pretender  WE by the Mercy of God FreeHolders of  GreatBritain  to the Popish Pretender who stiles himself King of  Scotland  and  England  and  Defender of our Faith DEFIANCE Having seen a Libel which you have lately published against the King and People of these Realms under the Title of a DECLARATION We  in Justice to the Sentiments of our own Hearts  have thought fit to return you the following Answer wherein we shall endeavour to reduce the Method the several Particulars which you have contrived to throw together with much Malice and no less Confusion  We believe you sincere in the first Part of your Declaration where you own it would be a great Satisfaction to you to be placed upon the Throne by our Endeavours But you discourage us from making use of them by declaring it to be your Right  both by the Laws of God and Man  As for the Laws of God we should think ourselves great Transgressors of them should we for your Sake rebel against a Prince who under God is the most powerful Defender of that Religion which we think the most pleasing to Him And as for the Laws of Man we conceive those to be of that Kind which have been enacted from Time to Time for near thirty Years past against you and your Pretensions by the Legislature of this Kingdom  You afterwards proceed to Invectives against the Royal Family Which we do assure you is a very unpopular Topick except to your few deluded Friends among the Rabble  You call them  Aliens to our Countrey  not considering that King  George  has lived above a Year longer in  England  than ever you did You say they are  Distant in Blood  whereas no Body ever doubted that King  George  is great Grandson to King  James  the First though many believe that you are not Son to King  James  the Second  Besides all the World acknowledges he is the nearest to our Crown of the Protestant Blood of which you cannot have one Drop in your Veins unless you derive it from such Parents as you don't care for owning  Your next Argument against the Royal Family is that they are  Strangers to our Language  But they must be Strangers to the  British  Court who have told you so However you must know that we plain Men should prefer a King who was a Stranger to our Language before one who is a Stranger to our Laws and Religion For we could never endure  French  Sentiments though delivered in our native Dialect and should abhor an arbitrary Prince though he tyranniz'd over us in the finest  English  that ever was spoken For these Reasons Sir we cannot bear the Thought of hearing a Man that has been bred up in the Politicks of  Lewis  the Fourteenth talk intelligibly from the  British  Throne especially when we consider however he may boast of his speaking  English  he says his Prayers in an unknown Tongue  We come now to the Grievances for which in your Opinion we ought to take up Arms against our present Soveraign The greatest you seem to insist upon and which is most in the Mouths of your Party is the Union of the two Kingdoms for which his Majesty ought most certainly to be deposed because it was made under the Reign of her whom you call your  Dear Sister of Glorious Memory  Other Grievances which you hint at under His Majesty's Administration are the Murder of King  Charles  the First who was Beheaded before King  George  was born and the Sufferings of King  Charles  the Second which perhaps His present Majesty cannot  wholly clear Himself of because He came into the World a Day before His Restoration  As on the one Side you arraign His present Majesty by this most extraordinary Retrospect on the other Hand you condemn His Government by what we may call the Spirit of Second Sight You are not content to draw into His Reign those Mischiefs that were done a hundred Years ago unless you anticipate those that may happen a hundred Years hence So that the keenest of your Arrows either fall short of Him or fly over his Head We take it for a certain Sign that you are at a loss for present Grievances when you are thus forced to have recourse to your  future Prospects and future Miseries  Now Sir you must know that we FreeHolders have a natural Aversion to Hanging and don't know how to answer it to our Wives and Families if we should venture our Necks upon the Truth of your Prophecies In our ordinary Way of Judging we guess at the King's future Conduct by what we have seen already and therefore beg you will excuse us if for the present we defer entring into a Rebellion to which you so graciously invite us When we have as bad a Prospect of our King  George  's Reign as we should have of yours then will be your Time to date another Declaration from your Court at  Commerci  Which if we may be allowed to Prophecy in our Turn cannot possibly happen before the hundred and fiftieth Year of your Reign  Having considered the past and future Grievances mentioned in your Declaration we come now to the present all of which are founded upon this Supposition That whatever is done by His Majesty or His Ministers to keep you out of  the  British  Throne is a Grievance These Sir may be Grievances to you but they are none to us On the contrary we look upon them as the greatest Instances of His Majesty's Care and Tenderness for His People To take them in Order The first relates to the Ministry who are chosen as you observe very rightly out of the Worst and not the Best of  Your  Subjects Now Sir can you in Conscience think us to be such Fools as to rebel against the King for having employed those who are His most eminent Friends and were the greatest Sufferers in His Cause before He came to the Crown and for having removed a General who is now actually in Arms against him and two Secretaries of State both of whom have listed themselves in your Service or because He chose to substitute in their Places such Men who had distinguished themselves by their Zeal against you in the most famous Battels Negotiations and Debates  The second Grievance you mention is that the Glory of the late Queen has suffered who you insinuate  had secured to you the Enjoyment of that Inheritance out of which you had been so long kept  This may indeed be a Reason why Her Memory shall be precious with you But you may be sure we shall think never the better of Her for Her having your good Word For the same Reason it makes us stare when we hear it objected to His present Majesty  That he is not kind to Her faithful Servants  since if we can believe what you yourself say it is impossible they should be  His faithful Servants  And by the way many of your private Friends here wish you would forbear blabbing at this rate For to tell you a Secret we are very apt to suspect  that any  English  Man who deserves your Praise deserves to be Hanged  The next Grievance which you have a mighty Mind to redress among us is the Parliament of  Great Britain  against whom you bring a stale Accusation which has been used by every Minority in the Memory of Man namely that it was procured by unwarrantable Influences and Corruptions We cannot indeed blame you for being angry at those who have set such a round Price upon your Head Your Accusation of our High Court of Parliament puts us in Mind of a Story often told among us  FreeHolders  concerning a rattlebrain'd young Fellow who being indicted for two or three Pranks upon the Highway told the Judge he would swear the Peace against him for putting him in fear of his Life  The next Grievance is such a one that we are amazed how it could come into your Head Your Words are as follow  Whilst the Principal Powers engaged in the late Wars do enjoy the Blessings of Peace and are attentive to discharge their Debts and ease their People  Great Britain  in the midst of Peace feels all the Load of War  New Debts  are contracted  new Armies  are raised at Home  Dutch  Forces are brought into these Kingdoms  What in the Name of Wonder do you mean Are you in earnest or do you design to banter us Whom is the Nation obliged to for all this Load of War that it feels Had you been wise enough to have slept at  Barleduc  in a whole Skin we should not have contracted new Debts raised new Armies or brought over  Dutch  Forces to make an Example of you  The most pleasant Grievance is still behind and indeed a most proper one to close up this Article  King  George  has taken Possession of the Dutchy of  Bremen  whereby a Door is opened to let in an Innundation of Foreigners from Abroad and to reduce these Nations to the State of a Province to one of the most inconsiderable Provinces of the Empire  And do you then really believe the MobStory that King  George  designs to make a Bridge of Boats from  Hanover  to  Wapping  We would have you know that some of us read  Baker  's Chronicle and don't find that  William  the Conqueror ever thought of making  England  a Province to his Native Dutchy of  Normandy  notwithstanding it lay so much more convenient for that Purpose Nor that King  James  the First had ever any Thoughts of reducing this Nation to the State of a Province to his ancient Kingdom of  Scotland  though it lies upon the same Continent But pray how comes it to pass that the Electorate of  Hanover  is become all of a sudden one of the most inconsiderable Provinces of the Empire If you undervalue it upon the Account of its Religion you have some Reason for what you say though you should not think we are such Strangers to Maps and live so much out of the World as to be ignorant that it is for Power and Extent the second Protestant State in  Germany  and whether you know it or no the Protestant Religion in the Empire is looked upon as a sufficient Balance against Popery Besides you should have considered that in your Declaration upon the King's coming to the Throne of  Great Britain  you endeavoured to terrify us from receiving him by representing him  as a powerful foreign Prince supported by a numerous Army of his own Subjects  Be that as it will we are no more afraid of being a Province to  Hanover  than the  Hanoverians  are apprehensive of being a Province to  Bremen  We have now taken Notice of those great Evils which you are come to rescue us from But as they are such as we have neither felt or seen we desire you will put yourself to no farther Trouble for our sakes  You afterwards begin a kind of  Te Deum  before the Time in that remarkable Sentence  We adore the Wisdom of the Divine Providence which has opened a way to our Restoration by the Success of those very Measures that were laid to disappoint us for ever  We are at a loss to know what you mean by this Devout Jargon But by what goes before and follows we suppose it to be this That the coming of King  George  to the Crown has made many Malecontens and by that Means opened a Way to your Restoration whereas you should consider that if he had not come to the Crown the Way had been open of itself In the same pious Paragraph  You most earnestly conjure us to pursue those Methods for your Restoration which the Finger of God seems to point out to us  Now the only Methods which we can make use for that End are Civil War Rapine Bloodshed Treason and Perjury Methods which we Protestants do humbly conceive can never be pointed out to us by the Finger of God  The Rest of your Declaration contains the Encouragements you give us to Rebell First you promise to share with us  all Dangers and Difficulties  which we shall meet with in this worthy Enterprize You are very much in the Right on't You have nothing to lose and hope to get a Crown We don't hope for any new FreeHolds and only desire to keep what we have As therefore you are in the right to undergo Dangers and Difficulties to make yourself our Master we shall think ourselves as much in  the right to undergo Dangers and Difficulties to hinder you from being so  Secondly You promise to  refer your and our Interest to a  Scotch  Parliament  which you are resolved to call immediately We suppose you mean if the Frost holds But Sir we are certainly informed there is a Parliament now sitting at  Westminster  that are busy at present in taking care both of the  Scotch  and  English  Interest and have actually done every thing which you would  let  be done by our Representatives in the HighLands  Thirdly  You promise that if we will Rebel for you against our present Soveraign you will remit and discharge all Crimes of HighTreason Misprision and all other Crimes and Offences whatsoever done or committed against you or your Father  But will you answer in this Case that King  George  will forgive us Otherwise we beseech you to consider what poor Comfort it would be for a  British  FreeHolder to be conveyed up  Holbourn  with your Pardon in his Pocket And here we cannot but remark that the Conditions of your General Pardon are so stinted as to shew that you are very cautious lest your good Nature should carry you too far You exclude from the Benefit of it all those who do not  from the time of your Landing lay hold on Mercy and return to their Duty and Allegiance  By this means all Neuters and Lookers on are to be executed of Course And by the studied Ambiguity in which you couch the Terms of your gracious Pardon you still leave room to gratify yourself in all the Pleasures of Tyranny and Revenge  Upon the Whole we have so bad an Opinion of Rebellion as well as of your Motives to  it and Rewards for it that you may rest satisfied there are few FreeHolders on this Side the  Forth  who will engage in it And we verily believe that you will suddenly take a Resolution in your Cabinet of  Highlanders  to scamper off with your new Crown which we are told the Ladies of those Parts have so generously Clubbed for And you may assure yourself that it is the only One you are like to get by this notable Expedition And so we bid you heartily Farewel  Dated  Jan    in the Second Year of our Publick Happiness  No Monday January  Potior visa est periculosa Libertas quieto Servitio  Sall  ONE may venture to affirm that all honest and disinterested  Britons  of what Party soever if they understood one another are of the same Opinion in Points of Government And that the Gross of the People who are imposed upon by Terms which they do not comprehend are  Whigs  in their Hearts They are made to believe that Passive Obedience and NonResistance Unlimited Power and Indefeasible Right have something of a venerable and religious Meaning in them whereas in Reality they only imply that a King of  Great Britain  has a Right to be a Tyrant and that his Subjects are obliged in Conscience to be Slaves Were the  Case truly and fairly laid before them they would know that when they make a Profession of such Principles they renounce their legal Claim to Liberty and Property and unwarily submit to what they really abhor  It is our Happiness under the present Reign to hear our King from the Throne exhorting us to be  zealous Assertors of the Liberties of our Countrey  which exclude all Pretensions to an arbitrary tyrannick or despotick Power Those who have the Misfortune to live under such a Power have no other Law but the Will of their Prince and consequently no Privileges but what are precarious For though in some arbitrary Governments there may be a Body of Laws observed in the ordinary Forms of Justice they are not sufficient to secure any Rights to the People because they may be dispensed with or laid aside at the Pleasure of the Soveraign  And here it very much imports us to consider that Arbitrary Power naturally tends to make a Man a bad Soveraign who might possibly have been a good One had he been invested with an Authority limited and circumscrib'd by Laws None can doubt of this Tendency in Arbitrary Power who consider that it fills the Mind of Man with great and unreasonable Conceits of Himself raises Him into a Belief that He is of a Superior Species to His Subjects extinguishes in Him the Principle of Fear which is one of the greatest Motives to all Duties and creates an Ambition of magnifying Himself by the Exertion of such a Power in all its Instances So great is the Danger that when a Soveraign can do what He will He will do what He can  One of the most Arbritary Princes in our Age was  Muley Ishmael  Emperour of  Morocco  who after a long Reign dy'd about a Twelve Month ago This Prince was a Man of much Wit and natural Sense of an active Temper undaunted Courage and great application He was a Descendent of  Mahomet  and so exemplary for his Adherence to the Law of his Prophet that he abstained all his Life from the Taste of Wine began the annual Fast or  Lent  of  Ramadan  two Months before his Subjects was frequent in his Prayers and that he might not want Opportunities of Kneeling had fixed in all the spacious Courts of his Palace large Consecrated Stones pointing towards the East for any occasional Exercise of his Devotion What might not have been hoped from a Prince of these Endowments had they not all been rendered useless and ineffectual to the Good of his People by the Notion of that Power which they ascribed to him This will appear if we consider how he exercised it towards his Subjects in those three great Points which are the chief Ends of Government the Preservation of their Lives the Security of their Fortunes and the Determinations of Justice between Man and Man  Foreign Envoys who have given an Account of their Audiences describe this holy Man mounted on horseback in an open Court with several of his  Alcaydes  or Governours of Provinces about him standing bare foot trembling bowing to the Earth and at every Word he spoke breaking out into passionate Exclamations of Praise as  Great is the Wisdom of our Lord the King Our Lord the King speaks as an Angel from Heaven  Happy was the Man among them who was so much a Favourite as to be  sent on an Errand to the most remote Street in his Capital which he performed with the greatest Alacrity ran through every Puddle that lay in his Way and took Care to return out of Breath and cover'd with Dirt that he might shew himself a diligent and faithful Minister His Majesty at the same Time to exhibit the Greatness of his Power and shew his Horsemanship seldom dismiss'd the Foreigner from his Presence 'till he had entertain'd him with the Slaughter of two or three of his Liege Subjects whom he very dexterously put to Death with the Tilt of his Launce St  Olon  the  French  Envoy tells us that when he had his last Audience of him he receiv'd him in Robes just stain'd with an Execution and that he was blooded up to his Elbows by a Couple of  Moors  whom he had been butchering with his own Imperial Hands By the Calculation of that Author and many Others who have since given an Account of his Exploits we may reckon that by his own Arm he killed above Forty Thousand of his People To render himself the more awful he chose to wear a Garb of a particular Colour when he was bent upon Executions so that when he appear'd in Yellow his Great Men hid themselves in Corners and durst not pay their Court to him till he had satiated his Thirst of Blood by the Death of some of his loyal Commoners or of such unwary Officers of State as chanc'd to come in his Way Upon this Account we are told that the first News enquir'd after every Morning at  Mequinez  was Whether the Emperour were stirring and in a good or bad Humour As this Prince was a great Admirer of Architecture and employ'd many Thousands in Works of  that Kind if he did not approve the Plan or the Performance it was usual for him to shew the Delicacy of his Taste by demolishing the Building and putting to Death all that had a Hand in it I have heard but of one Instance of his Mercy which was shewn to the Master of an  English  Vessel This our Countreyman presented him with a curious Hatchet which he receiv'd very graciously and asking him whether it had a good Edge try'd it upon the Donor who slipping aside from the Blow escap'd with the Loss only of his right Ear for Old  Muley  upon second Thoughts considering that it was not one of his own Subjects stopp'd his Hand and would not send him to Paradise I cannot quit this Article of his Tenderness for the Lives of his People without mentioning one of his Queens whom he was remarkably fond of as also a Favourite Prime Minister who was very dear to him The first dy'd by a Kick of her Lord the King when she was big with Child for having gather'd a Flower as she was walking with him in his Pleasure Garden The Other was bastinado'd to Death by his Majesty who repenting of the Drubs he had given him when it was too late to manifest his Esteem for the Memory of so Worthy a Man executed the Surgeon that could not cure him  This Absolute Monarch was as notable a Guardian of the Fortunes as of the Lives of his Subjects When any Man among his People grew rich in Order to keep him from being dangerous to the State he used to send for all his Goods and Chattels His Governours of Towns and Provinces who form'd themselves upon the Example of their  Grand Monarque    practised Rapine Violence Extortion and all the Arts of Despotick Government in their respective Districts that they might be the better enabled to make him their yearly Presents For the greatest of his Viceroys could only propose to himself a comfortable Subsistence out of the Plunder of his Province and was in certain Danger of being recall'd or hang'd if he did not remit the Bulk of it to his Dread Soveraign That he might make a right Use of these Prodigious Treasures which flow'd in to him from all the Parts of his wide Empire he took Care to bury them under Ground by the Hands of his most trusty Slaves and then cut their Throats as the most effectual Method to keep them from making Discoveries These were his  Ways  and  Means  for raising Money by which he weaken'd the Hands of the Factious and in any Case of Emergency could employ the whole Wealth of his Empire which he had thus amassed together in his subterraneous Exchequer  As there is no such Thing as Property under an Arbitrary Government you may learn what was  Muley Ishmael  's Notion of it from the following Story Being upon the Road amidst his LifeGuards a little before the Time of the  RamFeast  he met one of his  Alcaydes  at the Head of his Servants who were driving a great Flock of Sheep to Market The Emperor ask'd whose they were The  Alcayde  answered with profound Submission  They are mine  O Ishmael  Son of  Elcherif  of the Line of  Hassan Thine  thou Son of a Cuckold  said this SERVANT OF THE LORD  I thought I had been the only Proprietor in this Countrey  upon which he run him through the Body with his Launce and very  piously distributed the Sheep among his Guards for the Celebration of the Feast  His Determinations of Justice between Man and Man were indeed very summary and decisive and generally put an End to the Vexations of a LawSuit by the Ruin both of Plaintiff and Defendant Travellers have recorded some Samples of this Kind which may give us an Idea of the Blessings of his Administration One of his  Alcaydes  complaining to him of a Wife whom he had received from his Majesty's Hands and therefore could not divorce her that she used to pull him by the Beard the Emperor to redress this Grievance order'd his Beard to be plucked up by the Roots that he might not be liable to any more such Affronts A Countrey Farmer having accus'd some of his Negro Guards for Robbing him of a Drove of Oxen the Emperor readily shot the Offenders But afterwards demanding Reparation of the Accuser for the Loss of so many Brave Fellows and finding him insolvent compounded the Matter with him by taking away his Life There are many other Instances of the same Kind I must observe however under this Head that the only good Thing he is celebrated for during his whole Reign was the clearing of the Roads and HighWays of Robbers with which they used to be very much infested But his Method was to slay Man Woman and Child who lived within a certain Distance from the Place where the Robbery was committed This extraordinary Piece of Justice could not but have its Effect by making every Road in his Empire unsafe for the Profession of a FreeBooter  I must not omit this Emperor's Reply to Sir  Cloudesly Shovel  who had taken several of his Subjects by Way of Reprizal for the  English  Captives that were detained in his Dominions Upon the Admiral's offering to exchange them on very advantageous Terms this good Emperor sent him Word The Subjects he had taken were poor Men not worth the Ransoming and that he might throw them over Board or destroy them otherwise as he pleased  Such was the Government of  Muley Ishmael The Servant of God the Emperor of the Faithful who was Courageous in the Way of the Lord the Noble the Good  To conclude this Account which is extracted from the best Authorities I shall only observe that he was a great Admirer of His late Most Christian Majesty In a Letter to him he Compliments him with the Title of  Sovereign Arbiter of the Actions and Wills of his People  And in a Book published by a  French  Man who was sent to him as an Ambassador is the following Passage  He is absolute in his States and often compares himself to the Emperor of  France  who he says is the only Person that knows how to reign like himself and to make his Will the Law  This was that Emperor of  France  to whom the Person who has a great Mind to be King of these Realms owed his Education and from whom he learned his Notions of Government What should hinder One whose Mind is so well seasoned with such Prepossessions from attempting to copy after his Patron in the Exercise of such a Power especially considering that the Party who espouse his Interest never fail to compliment a Prince that distributes all his Places among  them with unlimited Power on his Part and unconditional Obedience on that of his Subjects  No Friday January  HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE  BY our latest Advices both from Town and Countrey it appears that the Ladies of  Great Britain  who are  able to bear Arms  that is to Smile or Frown to any Purpose have already begun to commit Hostilities upon the Men of each opposite Party To this End we are assared that many of them on both Sides  Exercise  before their Glasses every Morning that they have already cashiered several of their Followers as Mutineers who have contradicted them in some political Conversations and that the  Whig  Ladies in particular design very soon to have a general Review of their Forces at a Play bespoken by one of their Leaders This Sett of Ladies indeed as they daily do Duty at Court are much more expert in the Use of their Airs and Graces than their female Antagonists who are most of them bred in the Countrey So that the Sisterhood of Loyalists in respect of the fair Malecontents are like an Army of regular Forces compared with a raw undisciplined Militia  It is to this Misfortune in their Education that we may ascribe the rude and opprobrious Language with which the disaffected Part of the Sex treat the present Royal Family A little lively  Rustick who hath been trained up in Ignorance and Prejudice will prattle Treason a whole Winter's Evening and string together a Parcel of silly seditious Stories that are equally void of Decency and Truth Nay you sometimes meet with a zealous Matron who sets up for the Pattern of a Parish uttering such Invectives as are highly misbecoming her both as a Woman and a Subject In answer therefore to such distoyal Termagants I shall repeat to them a Speech of the honest and blunt Duke  du Sully  to an Assembly of  Popish  Ladies who were railing very bitterly against  Henry  the Fourth at his Accession to the  French  Throne  Ladies  said he  you have a very good King if you know when you are well However set your Hearts at rest for he is not a Man to be scolded or seratched out of his Kingdom  But as I never care to speak of the fair Sex unless I have an Occasion to Praise them I shall take my Leave of these ungentle Damsels and only beg of them not to make themselves less amiable than Nature designed them by being Rebels to the Best of their Abilities and endeavouring to bring their Countrey into Bloodshed and Confusion Let me therefore recommend to them the Example of those beautiful Associates whom I mentioned in my eighth Paper as I have received the Particulars of their Behaviour from the Person with whom I lodged their Association  This Association being written at length in a large Roll of the finest Vellum with three distinct Columns for the Maids Wives and Widows was opened for the Subscribers near a Fortnight ago Never was a Subscription for a  Raffiing  or an  Opera  more crowded There is  scarce a celebrated Beauty about Town that you may not find in one of the three Lists insomuch that if a Man who did not know the Design should read only the Names of the Subscribers he would fancy every Column to be a Catalogue of Toasts Mr  Motteux  has been heard to say more than once that if he had the Portraits of all the Associates they would make a finer Auction of Pictures than he or any Body else had ever exhibited  Several of these Ladies indeed criticised upon the Form of the Association One of them after the Perusal of it wondered that among the Features to be used in Defence of their Countrey there was no mention made of  Teeth  upon which she smiled very charmingly and discovered as fine a Sett as ever Eye beheld Another who was a tall lovely Prude holding up her Head in a most majestick Manner said with some Disdain She thought a  good Neck  might have done His Majesty as much Service as Smiles or Dimples A Third looked upon the Association as defective because so necessary a Word as  Hands  was omitted and by her Manner of taking up the Pen it was easy to guess the Reason of her Objection  Most of the Persons who associated have done much more than by the Letter of the Association they were obliged to having not only set their Names to it but subscribed their several Aids and Subsidies for the carrying on so good a Cause In the Virgin Column is one who subscribes fifteen Lovers all of them good Men and true There is another who subscribes five Admirers with one tall handsom black Man fit to be a Colonel In short there is scarce one in this List who does not engage  herself to supply a Quota of brisk young Fellows many of them already equipt with Hats and Feathers Among the rest was a pretty sprightly Coquette with sparkling Eyes who subscribed two Quivers of Arrows  In the Column of Wives the first who took Pen in Hand writ her own Name and one Vassal meaning her Husband Another subscribes her Husband and three Sons Another her Husband and six CoachHorses Most in this Catalogue paired themselves with their respective Mates answering for'em as Men of honest Principles and fit for the Service  N B  There were two in this Column that wore Association Ribbons The first of them subscribed her Husband and her Husband's Friend the second a Husband and five Lovers but upon enquiry into their Characters they are both of them found to be  Tories  who hung out false Colours to be Spies upon the Association or to insinuate to the World by their Subscriptions as if a Lady of  Whig  Principles could love any Man besides her Husband  The Widows Column is headed by a fine Woman who calls herself  Boadicea  and subscribes six hundred Tenants It was indeed observed that the Strength of the Association lay most in this Column every Widow in Proportion to her Jointure having a great Number of Admirers and most of them distinguished as able Men Those who have examined this List compute that there may be three Regiments raised out of it in which there shall not be one Man under fix Foot high  I must not conclude this Account without taking Notice of the ASSOCIATIONRIBBON by which these Beautiful Confederates  have agreed to distinguish themselves It is indeed so very pretty an Ornament that I wonder any  English  Woman will be without it  A Lady of the  ASSOCIATION who bears this Badge of Allegiance upon her Breast naturaly produces a Desire in every MaleBeholder of gaining a Place in a Heart which carries on it such a visible Mark of its Fidelity When the Beauties of our Island are thus industrious to shew their Principles as well as their Charms they raise the Sentiments of their Countreymen and inspire them at the same time both with Loyalty and Love What Numbers of Proselytes may we not expect when the most amiable of the  Britons  thus exhibit to their Admirers the only Terms upon which they are to hope for any Correspondence or Alliance with them It is well known that the greatest Blow the  French  Nation ever receiv'd was the dropping of a fine Lady's Garter in the Reign of King  Edward  the Third The most remarkable Battels which have been since gained over that Nation were fought under the Auspices of a Blue RIBBON As our  British  Ladies have still the same Faces and our Men the same Hearts why may we not hope for the same glorious Atchievements from the Influence of this Beautiful BreastKnot  No Monday January  Quapropter de summâ salute vestrâ P C de vestris conjugibus ac liberis de aris ac focis de fanis ac templis de totius urbis tectis ac sedibus de imperio de libertate de salute Patriae deque universâ Republicâ decernite diligenter ut instituistis ac fortiter  Cic  THIS Day having been set apart by Publick Authority to raise in us an Abhorrence of the  GREAT REBELLION  which involved this Nation in so many Calamities and ended in the Murder of their Soveraign it may not be unseasonable to shew the Guilt of Rebellion in general and of that Rebellion in particular which is stirred up against His present Majesty  That Rebellion is one of the most hainous Crimes which it is in the Power of Man to commit may appear from several Considerations  First  as it destroys the End of all Government and the Benefits of Civil Society Government was instituted for maintaining the Peace Safety and Happiness of a People These great Ends are brought about by a general Conformity and Submission to that Frame of Laws which is established in every Community for the Protection of the Innocent and the Punishment of the Guilty As on the one Side Men are secured the quiet Possession of their Lives Properties and every Thing they have a Right to So on the other Side those who  offer them any Injury in these Particulars are subject to Penalties proportioned to their respective Offences Government therefore mitigates the Inequality of Power among particular Persons and makes an innocent Man tho' of the lowest Rank a Match for the Mightiest of his FellowSubjects since he has the Force of the whole Community on his Side which is able to controul the Insolence or Injustice of any private Oppressor Now Rebellion disappoints all these Ends and Benefits of Government by raising a Power in Opposition to that Authority which has been established among a People for their mutual Welfare and Defence So that Rebellion is as great an Evil to Society as Government itself is a Blessing  In the next Place Rebellion is a Violation of all those Engagements which every Government exacts from such Persons as live under it and consequently the most base and pernicious Instance of Treachery and Perfidiousness The Guilt of Rebellion Increases in Proportion as these Engagements are more Solemn and Obligatory Thus if a Man makes his Way to Rebellion through Perjury he gives additional Horrors to that Crime which is in itself of the blackest Nature  We may likewise consider Rebellion as a greater Complication of Wickedness than any other Crime we can commit It is big with Repine Sacrilege and Murder It is dreadful in its mildest Effects as it impoverishes the Publick ruins particular Families begets and perpetuates Hatreds among FellowSubjects Friends and Relations makes a Countrey the Seat or War and Desolation and exposes it to the Attempts of its foreign Enemies In short  as it is impossible for it to take Effect or to make the smallest Progress but through a continued Course of Violence and Bloodshed a Robber or a Murderer looks like an Innocent Man when we compare him with a Rebel  I shall only add that as in the Subordinations of a Government the King is offended by any Insults or Oppositions to an inferior Magistrate so the Soveraign Ruler of the Universe is affronted by a Breach of Allegiance to those whom he has set over us Providence having delegated to the Supream Magistrate in every Countrey the same Power for the Good of Men which that Supreme Magistrate transfer to those several Officers and Substitutes who  under Him for the preserving of Order and Ju+stice  Now if we take a View of the present Rebel+lion which is formed against His Majesty we shall find in it all the Guilt that is naturally inhe+rent in this Crime without any single Circum+stance to alleviate it Insurrections among  People to rescue themselves from the most vio…lent and illegal Oppressions to throw off a Ty+ranny that makes Property precarious and Li  painful to preserve their Laws and their Reli…gion to themselves and their Posterity are ex+cused from the Necessity of such an Underta+king when no other Means are left for the Se+curity of every Thing that is dear and valua  to reasonable Creatures By the Frame of  Constitution the Duties of Protection and Alle…giance are reciprocal and as the Safety of  Community is the ultimate End and Design  Government when this instead of being pre…served is manifestly destroy'd Civil Societi  are excusable before God and Man if they en+  deavour to recover themselves out of so miserable a Condition For in such a Case Government becomes an Evil instead of a Blessing and is not at all preferable to a State of Anarchy and mutual Independence For these Reasons we have scarce ever yet heard of an Insurrection that was not either coloured with Grievances of the highest Kind or countenanced by one or more Branches of the Legislature But the present Rebellion is form'd against a King whose Right has been establish'd by frequent Parliaments of all Parties and recogniz'd by the most solemn Oaths who has not been charged with one illegal Proceeding who acts in perfect Concert with the Lords and Commons of the Realm who is famed for his Equity and Goodness and has already very much advanc'd the Reputation and Interest of our Countrey The Guilt therefore of this Rebellion has in it all the most aggravating Circumstances which will still appear more plainly if we consider in the first Place the real Motives to it  The Rebellion which was one of the most flagitious in itself and describ'd with the most Horrour by Historians is that of  Catiline  and his Associates Their Motives to it are display'd at large by the  Roman  Writers in order to inspire the Reader with the utmost Detestation of it  Catiline  the Chief of the Rebellion had been disappointed in his Competition for one of the first Offices in the Government and had involved himself in such private Debts and Difficulties as nothing could extricate him out of but the Ruin of an Administration that would not entrust him with Posts of Honour or Profit His principal Accomplices were Men of the same Character and animated by the same Incentives  They complained that Power was lodged in the Hands of the Worst to the Oppression of the Best and that Places were conferred on unworthy Men to the Exclusion of themselves and their Friends Many of them were afraid of publick Justice for past Crimes and some of them stood actually condemned as Traitors to their Countrey These were joined by Men of desperate Fortunes who hoped to find their Account in the Confusions of their Countrey were applauded by the meanest of the Rabble who always delighted in Change and privately abetted by Persons of a considerable Figure who aimed at those Honours and Preferments which were in the Possession of their Rivals These are the Motives with which  Catiline  's Rebellion is branded in History and which are expressly mentioned by  Sallust  I shall leave it to every unprejudiced Reader to compare them with the Motives which have kindled the present Rebellion in His Majesty's Dominions  As this Rebellion is of the most criminal Nature from its Motives so it is likewise if we consider its Consequences Should it Succeed a Supposition which God be thanked is very extravagant what must be the natural Effects of it upon our Religion What could we expect from an Army blest by the Pope headed by a zealous  RomanCatholick  encouraged by the most bigotted Princes of the Church of  Rome  supported by Contributions not only from these several Potentates but from the Wealthiest of their Convents and officer'd by  Irish  Papists and Outlaws Can we imagine that the  RomanCatholicks  of our own Nation would so heartily embark in an Enterprize to the visible Hazard of their Lives and Fortunes did they only hope  to enjoy their Religion under those Laws which are now in Force In short the Danger to the Protestant Cause is so manifest that it would be an Affront to the Understanding of the Reader to endeavour farther to prove it  Arbitrary Power is so interwoven with Pope  y and so necessary to introduce it so agreeable  the Education of the Pretender so conforma  to the Principles of his Adherents and so  ural to the Insolence of Conquerors that  ould our Invader gain the Soveraign Power  Violence there is no doubt but he would  eserve it by Tyranny I shall leave to the  eader's own Consideration the Change of  operty in general and the utter Extinction of  our National Funds the Inundation of No  s without Estates Prelates without Bisho  cks Officers Civil and Military without  ces and in short the several Occasions of  ine and Revenge which would necessarily  upon such a fatal Revolution But by  Blessing of Providence and the Wisdom of Majesty's Administration this melancholly  spect is as distant as it is dreadful  These are the Consequences which would  essarily attend the Success of the present  ellion But we will now suppose that the  of it should for some time remain Doubt  ▪ In this Case we are to expect all the Mise  of a Civil War Nay the Armies of the  est Foreign Princes would be subsisted and  Battels of  Europe  fought in  England  The  have already shewn us that they want  clination to promote their Cause by Fire  word where they have an Opportunity of  sing their Barbarities Should such a fierce  apacious Host of Men as that which is  now in the Highlands fall down into our Countrey that is so well Peopled adorned and cultivated how would their March be distinguished by Ravage and Devastation Might not we say of them in the sublime and beautiful Word of the Prophet describing the Progress of an enraged Army from the North  Before them as  Garden of  Eden  and behind them as  desolate Wilderness yea and nothing shall  them  What then can we think of a Party  would plunge their native Countrey into  Evils as these when the only avowed Mo  for their Proceedings is a Point of Theory  has been already determined by those who  proper Judges and in whose Determination  have so many Years acquiesced If the Ca  +mities of the Nation in General can make  Impression on them let them at least in  to themselves their Friends and Depend  forbear all open and secret Methods of En  +raging a Rebellion so destructive and so  provoked All human Probabilities are aga  them and they cannot expect Success but  a miraculous Interposition of the Almig  ▪ And this we may with all Christian Hum  hope will not turn against us who ob  those Oaths which we have made in His  …sence who are zealous for the Safety of  Religion which we think most acceptab  His Sight and who endeavour to preserve  Constitution which is most conducive to  Happiness of our Countrey  No Friday February  Ignavum sucos pecus à praesepibus arcent  Virg  THE most common and indeed the most natural Division of all Offences is into those of Omission and those of Commission We may make the same Division of that particular Set of Crimes which regard Human Society The greatest Crime which can be committed against it is Rebellion as was shewn in my last Paper The greatest Crime of Omission is an Indifference in the particular Members of a Society when a Rebellion is actually begun among them In such a Juncture though a Man may be innocent of the great Breach which is made upon Government he is highly culpable if he does not use all the Means that are suitable to his Station for reducing the Community into its former State of Peace and good Order  Our Obligation to be active on such an Occasion appears from the very Nature of Civil Government which is an Institution whereby we are all confederated together for our mutual Defence and Security Men who profess a State of Neutrality in Times of Publick Danger desert the Common Interest of their FellowSubjects and act with Independence to that Constitution into which they are incorporated The Safety of the whole requires our joint Endeavours When this is at Stake the indifferent are not properly a Part of the Community  or rather are like dead Limbs which are an Incumbrance to the Body instead of being of Use to it Besides that the Protection which all receive from the same Government justly calls upon the Gratitude of All to Strengthen it as well as upon their SelfInterest to preserve it  But farther If Men who in their Hearts are Friends to a Government forbear giving it their utmost Assistance against its Enemies they put it in the Power of a few desperate Men to ruine the Welfare of those who are much superior to them in Strength Number and Interest It was a remarkable Law of  Solon  the great Legislator of the  Athenians  that any Person who in the Civil Tumults and Commotions of the Republick remained Neuter or an indifferent Spectator of the contending Parties should after the Reestablishment of the publick Peace forfeit all his Possessions and be condemned to perpetual Banishment This Law made it necessary for every Citizen to take his Party because it was highly probable the Majority would be so Wise as to espouse that Cause which was most agreeable to the publick Weal and by that Means hinder a Sedition from making a successful Progress At least as every prudent and honest Man who might otherwise favour any Indolence in his own Temper was hereby engaged to be active such a one would be sure to join himself to that Side which had the Good of their Countrey most at Heart For this Reason their famous Lawgiver condemned the Persons who sate Idle in Divisions so dangerous to the Government as Aliens to the Community and therefore to be cut off from it as unprofitable Members  Further Indifference cannot but be criminal when it is conversant about Objects which are so far from being of an indifferent Nature that they are of the highest Importance to our selves and our Countrey If it be indifferent to us whether we are FreeSubjects or Slaves whether our Prince be of our own Religion or of one that obliges him to extirpate it we are in the right to give ourselves no trouble in the present Juncture A Man governs himself by the Dictates of Virtue and good Sense who acts without Zeal or Passion in Points that are of no Consequences But when the whole Community is shaken and the Safety of the Publick endanger'd the Appearance of a Philosophical or an affected Indolence must arise either from Stupidity or Perfidiousness  When in the Division of Parties among us Men only strove for the first Place in the Prince's Favour when all were attached to the same Form of Government and contended only for the highest Offices in it a prudent and an honest Man might look upon the Struggle with Indifference and be in no great Pain for the Success of either Side But at present the Contest is not in Reality between  Whigs  and  Tories  but between  Loyalists  and  Rebels  Our Countrey is not now divided into two Parties who propose the same End by different Means but into such as would preserve and such as would destroy it Whatever Denominations we might range our selves under in former Times Men who have any natural Love to their Countrey or Sense of their Duty should exert their united Strength in a Cause that is common to all Parties as they are Protestants and  Britons  In such a Case an avowed Indifference is Treachery to our FellowSubjects  and a Lukewarm Allegiance▪ may prove as pernicious in its Consequences as Treason  I need not repeat here what I have proved at large in a former Paper that we are obliged to an active Obedience by the solemn Oaths we have taken to His Majesty and that the neutral Kind of Indifference which is the Subject of this Paper falls short of that Obligation they lie under who have taken such Oaths as will easily appear to any one who considers the Form of those sacred and religious Engagements  How then can any Man answer it to himself if for the sake of managing his Interest or Character among a Party or out of any personal Pique to those who are the most conspicuous for their Zeal in His Majesty's Service or from any other private and selfinterested Motive he stands as a Looker on when the Government is attacked by an open Rebellion especially when those engaged in it cannot have the least Prospect of Success but by the Assistance of the ancient and hereditary Enemies to the  British  Nation It is strange that these Luke warm Friends to the Government whose Zeal for their Soveraign rises and falls with their Credit at Court do not consider before it be too late that as they strengthen the Rebels by their present Indifference they at the same time establish the Interest of those who are their Rivals and Competitors for publick Posts of Honour When there is an End put to this Rebellion these Gentlemen cannot pretend to have had any Merit in so good a Work And they may well believe the Nation will never care to see those Men it the highest Offices of Trust who when they an out of them will not stir a Finger in its De+fence  No Monday February  Periculosum est credere non credere  Utriusque exemplum breviter exponam rei  Hippolytus obiit quia novercae creditum est  Cassandrae quia non creditum ruit Ilium  Ergo exploranda est veritas multùm priùs  Quam stulta pravè judicet sententia  Phaedr  HAVING in the Seventh Paper consider'd many of those Falshoods by which the Cause of our Malecontents is supported I shall here speak of that extravagant Credulity which disposes each particular Member of their Party to believe them This strange Alacrity in Believing Absurdity and Inconsistence may be called the  Political Faith  of a Tory  A Person who is thoroughly endowed with this Political Faith like a Man in a Dream is entertained from one end of his Life to the other with Objects that have no Reality or Existence He is daily nourished and kept in Humour by Fiction and Delusion and may be compared to the old obstinate Knight in  Rabelais  that every Morning swallowed a Chimera for his Breakfast  This Political Faith of a Malecontent is altogether founded on Hope He does not give Credit to any thing because it is probable but because it is pleasing His Wishes serve him instead of Reasons to confirm the Truth of what he hears There is no Report so incredible or contradictory in itself which he doth not chearfully  believe if it tends to the Advancement of the Cause In short a Malecontent who is a good Believer has generally reason to repeat the celebrated Rant of an Ancient Father  Credo quia impossibile est  Which is as much as to say  It must be True because it is Impossible  It has been very well observed that the most credulous Man in the World is the Atheist who believes the Universe to be the Production of Chance In the same Manner a Tory who is the greatest Believer in what is improbable is the greatest Infidel in what is certain Let a Friend to the Government relate to him a Matter of Fact he turns away his Ear from him and gives him the Lye in every Look But if one of his own Stamp should tell him that the King of  Sweden  would be suddenly at  Perth  and that his Army is now actually marching thither upon the Ice he hugs himself at the good News and gets Drunk upon it before he goes to Bed This sort of People puts one in Mind of several Towns in  Europe  that are inaccessible on the one Side while they lie open and unguarded on the other The Minds of our Malecontents are indeed so depraved with those Falshoods which they are perpetually imbibing that they have a natural Relish for Error and have quite lost the Taste of Truth in political Matters I shall therefore dismiss this Head with a Saying of King  Charles  the Second This Monarch when he was at  Windsor  us'd to amuse himself with the Conversation of the famous  Vossius  who was full of Stories relating to the Antiquity Learning and Manners of the  Chinese  and at the same time a Freethinker in Points of Religion The King upon hearing him repeat some incredible Accounts of these  Eastern People turning to those who were about him  This Learned Divine  said he  is a very strange Man He believes every thing but the Bible  Having thus far considered the political Faith of the Party as it regards Matters of Fact let us in the next Place take a View of it with respect to those Doctrines which it embraces and which are the Fundamental Points whereby they are distinguished from those whom they used to represent as Enemies to the Constitution in Church and State How far their great Articles of political Faith with respect to our Ecclesiastical and Civil Government are consistent with themselves and agreeable to Reason and Truth may be seen in the following Paradoxes which are the Essentials of a  Tory  's Creed with relation to political Matters Under the Name of  Tories  I do not here comprehend Multitudes of welldesigning Men who were formerly included under that Denomination but are now in the Interest of His Majesty and the present Government These have already seen the evil Tendency of such Principles which are the  Credenda  of the Party as it is opposite to that of the  Whigs  Article  I That the Church of  England  will be always in Danger till it has a Popish King for its Defender  II That for the Safety of the Church no Subject should be Tolerated in any Religion different from the Establish'd but that the Head of our Church may be of that Religion which is most repugnant to it  III That the Protestant Interest in this Nation and in all  Europe  could not but flourish under the Protection of One who thinks himself obliged on Pain of Damnation to do all that lies in his Power for the Extirpation of it  IV That we may safely rely upon the Promises of One whose Religion allows him to make them and at the same Time obliges him to break them  V That a good Man should have a greater Abhorrence of Presbyterianism which is Perverseness than of Popery which is but Idolatry  VI That a Person who hopes to be King of  England  by the Assistance of  France  would naturally adhere to the  British  Interest which is always opposite to that of the  French  VIIThat a Man has no Opportunities of learning how to Govern the People of  England  in any foreign Countrey so well as in  France  VIII That ten Millions of People should rather choose to fall into Slavery than not acknowledge their Prince to be invested with an Hereditary and Indefeasible Right of Oppression  IX That we are obliged in Conscience to become Subjects of a Duke of  Savoy  or of a  French  King rather than enjoy for our Soveraign a Prince who is the First of the Royal Blood in the Protestant Line  X That NonResistance is the Duty of every Christian whilst he is in a good Place  XI That we ought to profess the Doctrine of PassiveObedience till such Time as Nature rebels against Principle that is till we are put to the Necessity of practising it  XII That the Papists have taken up Arms to defend the Church of  England  with the utmost Hazard of their Lives and Fortunes  XIII That there is an Unwarrantable Faction in this Island consisting of King Lords and Commons  XIV That the Legislature when there is a Majority of  Whigs  in it has not Power to make Laws  XV That an Act of Parliament to impower the King to Secure Suspected Persons in Times of Rebellion is the Means to Establish the Soveraign on the Throne and consequently a great Infringement of the Liberties of the Subject  No Friday February  Auxilium quoniam sic cogitis ipsi  Dixit ab Hoste petam Vultus avertite vestros  Si quis Amicus adest Et Gorgonis extulit ora  Ovid  IT is with great Pleasure that I see a Race of FemalePatriots springing up in this Island The fairest among the Daughters of  GreatBritain  no longer confine their Cares to a Domestick Life but are grown anxious for the Welfare of their Countrey and shew themselves good Stateswomen as well as good Housewives  Our SheConfederates keep pace with us in quashing that Rebellion which had begun to spread itself among Part of the fair Sex If the Men who are true to their King and Countrey have taken  Preston  and  Perth  the Ladies have possess'd themselves of the Opera and the PlayHouse with as little Opposition or Bloodshed The Nonresisting Women like their Brothers in the  Highlands  think no Post tenable against an Army that makes so fine an Appearance and dare not look them in the Face when they are drawn up in Battelarray  As an Instance of the Chearfulness in our fair FellowSubjects to oppose the Designs of the Pretender I did but suggest in one of my former Papers  That the Fan might be made use of with good Success against Popery by exhibiting the Corruptions of the Church of  Rome  in various Figures  when immediately they took the Hint  and have since had frequent Consultations upon several Ways and Methods  to make the Fan useful  They have unanimously agreed upon the following Resolutions which are indeed very suitable to Ladies who are at the same Time the most Beautiful and the most Loyal of their Sex To hide their Faces behind the Fan when they observe a  Tory  gazing upon 'em Never to peep through it but in Order to pick out Men whose Principles make them worth the Conquest To return no other Answer to a  Tory  's Addresses than by counting the Sticks of it all the while he is talking to them To avoid dropping it in the Neighbourhood of a Malecontent that he may not have an Opportunity of taking it up To shew their Disbelief of any  Jacobite  Story by a Flirt of it To fall a Fanning themselves when a Tory comes into one of their Assemblies as being disorder'd at the Sight of him  These are the Uses by which every Fan may in the Hands of a fine Woman become serviceable to the Publick But they have at present under Consideration certain Fans of a Protestant Make that they may have a more extensive Influence and raise an Abhorrence of Popery in a whole Crowd of Beholders For they intend to let the World see what Party they are of by Figures and Designs upon these Fans as the Knights Errant used to distinguish themselves by Devices on their Shields  There are several Sketches of Pictures which have been already presented to the Ladies for their Approbation and out of which several have made their Choice A pretty young Lady will very soon appear with a Fan which has on it a Nunnery of lively blackEyed Vestals who  are endeavouring to creep out at the Grates Another has a Fan mounted with a fine Paper on which is represented a Groupe of People upon their Knees very devoutly worshipping an old TenPenny Nail A certain Lady of great Learning has chosen for her Device the Council of  Trent  and another who has a good Satyrical Turn has filled her Fan with the Figure of a huge tawdry Woman representing the Whore of  Babylon  which she is resolved to spread full in the Face of any SisterDisputant whose Arguments have a Tendency to Popery The following Designs are already executed on several Mountings The Ceremony of the Holy Pontiff opening the Mouth of a Cardinal in a full Consistory An old Gentleman with a Triple Crown upon his Head and big with Child being the Portrait of Pope  Joan  Bishop  Bonner  purchasing great Quantities of Faggots and BrushWood for the Conversion of Hereticks A Figure reaching at a Sceptre with one Hand and holding a Chaplet of Beads in the other With a distant View of  Smithfield  When our Ladies make their Zeal thus visible upon their Fans and every Time they open them display an Error of the Church of  Rome  it cannot but have a good Effect by shewing the Enemies of our present Establishment the Folly of what they are contending for At least every One must allow that Fans are much more innocent Engines for propagating the Protestant Religion than Racks Wheels Gibbets and the like Machines which are made Use of for the Advancement of the RomanCatholick Besides as every Lady will of course study her Fan she will be a perfect Mistress of the Controversy at least in one Point of Popery  and as her Curiosity will put her upon the Perusal of every other Fan that is fashionable I doubt not but in a very little Time there will scarce be a Woman of Quality in  GreatBritain  who would not be an OverMatch for an  Irish  Priest  The beautiful Part of this Island whom I am proud to number amongst the most candid of my Readers will likewise do well to reflect that our Dispute at present concerns our Civil as well as Religious Rights I shall therefore only offer it to their Thoughts as a Point that highly deserves their Consideration Whether the Fan may not also be made Use of with Regard to our Political Constitution As a FreeHolder I would not have them confine their Cares for us as we are Protestants but at the same Time have an Eye to our Happiness as we are  Britons  In this Case they wou'd give a new Turn to the Minds of their Countreymen if they wou'd exhibit on their Fans the several Grievances of a Tyrannical Government Why might not an Audience of  Muley Ishmael  or a  Turk  dropping his Handkerchief in his Seraglio be proper Subjects to express their Abhorrence both of Despotick Power and of Male Tyranny Or if they have a Fancy for Burlesque what wou'd they think of a  French  Cobler cutting Shoes for several of his FellowSubjects out of an old AppleTree On the contrary a fine Woman who wou'd maintain the Dignity of her Sex might bear a String of GallySlaves dragging their Chains the whole Breadth of her Fan and at the same Time to celebrate her own Triumphs might order every Slave to be drawn with the Face of one of her Admirers  I only propose these as Hints to my gent  Readers which they may alter or improve  they shall think fit But cannot conclude with+out congratulating our Countrey upon this Dis+position among the most amiable of its Inhabi+tants to consider in their Ornaments the Ad+vantage of the Publick as well as of their Per+sons It was with the same Spirit tho' not with the same Politeness that the ancient  British  Women had the Figures of Monsters painted on their naked Bodies in Order as our Historians tell us to make themselves Beautiful in the Eyes of their Countreymen and terrible to their Enemies If this Project goes on we may boast that our Sister  Whigs  have the finest Fans as well as the most Beautiful Faces of any Ladies in the World At least we may venture to foretel that the Figures in their Fans will lessen the  Tory  Interest much more than those in the  Oxford  Almanacks will advance it  No Monday February  Itaque quod plerumque in atroci negotio solet Senatus decrevit darent Operam Consules nè quid Respublica Detrimenti caperet Ea Potestas per Senatum More Romano Magistratui maxuma permittitur exercitum parare bellum gerere coercere omnibus modis Socios atque Cives domi militiaeque Imperium atque Judicium summum habere Aliter sine Populi jussu nulli earum Rerum Consuli Jus est  Sall  IT being the Design of these Papers to reconcile Men to their own Happiness by removing  those wrong Notions and Prejudices which hinder them from seeing the Advantage of themselves and their Posterity in the present Establishment I cannot but take Notice of every Thing that by the Artifice of our Enemies is made a Matter of Complaint  Of this Nature is the Suspension of the  Habeas Corpus  Act by which His Majesty has been enabled in these Times of Danger to seize and detain the Persons of such who He had Reason to believe were Conspiring against His Person and Government The Expediency and Reasonableness of such a temporary Suspension in the present Juncture may appear to every considerate Man who will turn his Thoughts impartially on this Subject  I have chosen in Points of this Nature to draw my Arguments from the first Principles of Government which as they are of no Party but assented to by every reasonable Man carry the greater Weight with them and are accommodated to the Notions of all my Readers Every One knows who has consider'd the Nature of Government that there must be in each particular Form of it an Absolute and Unlimited Power and that This Power is lodg'd in the Hands of those who have the Making of its Laws whether by the Nature of the Constitution it be in One or more Persons in a single Order of Men or in a mixt Body of different Ranks and Degrees It is an Absurdity to imagine that those who have the Authority of Making Laws cannot suspend any particular Law when they think it expedient for the Publick Without such a Power all Government would be defective and not arm'd with a sufficient Force for its own Security As  SelfPreservation by all honest Methods is the first Duty of every Community as well as of every private Person so the publick Safety is the general View of all Laws When therefore any Law does not conduce to this great End but on the contrary in some extraordinary and unnatural Junctures the very Observation of it would endanger the Community that Law ought to be laid asleep for such a Time by the proper Authority Thus the very Intention of our  Habeas Corpus  Act namely the Preservation of the Liberties of the Subject absolutely requires that Act to be now suspended since the Confinement of dangerous and suspected Persons who might strengthen this Rebellion and spread a Civil War through all Parts of this Kingdom secures to us our Civil Rights and every Thing that can be valuable to a Free People  As every Government must in its Nature be arm'd with such an Authority we may observe that those Governments which have been the most famous for publick Spirit and the most jealous of their Liberty have never failed to exert it upon proper Occasions There cannot be a greater Instance of this than in the old Common wealth of  Rome  who flatter'd themselves with an Opinion that their Government had in it a due Temper of the Regal Noble and Popular Power represented by the Consuls the Senators and the Tribunes The Regal Part was however in several Points notoriously defective and particularly because the Consuls had not a Negative in the passing of a Law as the other two Branches had Nevertheless in this Government when the Republick was threaten'd with any great and imminent Danger  they thought it for the common Safety to appoint a Temporary Dictator invested with the whole Power of the three Branches who when the Danger was over retired again into the Community and left the Government in its natural Situation But what is more to our Case the Consular Power itself tho' infinitely short of the Regal Power in  Great Britain  was intrusted with the whole Authority which the Legislature has put into the Hands of His Majesty We have an Eminent Instance of this in the Motto of my Paper which I shall Translate for the Benefit of the  English  Reader after having advertised him that the Power there given to the Consul was in the Time of a Conspiracy  The Senate therefore made a Decree as usual when they have Matters before them of so Horrid a Nature That the Consuls should take Care the CommonWealth did not suffer any Prejudice By Virtue of this very great Power which the Senate allows to the Magistrate according to the Antient Customs of  Rome  He may raise an Army wage War make Use of all kinds of Methods to restrain the Associates and Citizens of  Rome  and exercise the Supreme Authority both at Home and Abroad in Matters Civil and Military whereas otherwise the Consul is not invested with any of these Powers without the express Command of the People  There now only remains to shew that His Majesty is legally possest of this Power and that the Necessity of the present Affairs requires He should be so He is entrusted with it by the Legislature of the Nation and in the very Notion of a Legislature is implied a Power to change repeal and suspend what Laws are in Being as well as to make what new Laws they shall think fit for the Good of the  People This is so uncontroverted a Maxim that I believe never any Body attempted to refute it Our Legislature have however had that just Regard for their FellowSubjects as not to entertain a Thought of abrogating this Law but only to hinder it from operating at a Time when it would endanger the Constitution The King is empowered to act but for a few Months by Virtue of this Suspension and by that Means differs from a King of  France  or any other Tyrannical Prince who in Times of Peace and Tranquillity and upon what Occasion he pleases sends any of his Subjects out of the Knowledge of their Friends into such Castles Dungeons or Imprisonments as he thinks fit Nor did the Legislature do any Thing in this that was unprecedented The  Habeas Corpus  Act was made but about five and thirty Years ago and since that Time has been suspended four Times before his present Majesty's Accession to the Throne Twice under the Reign of King  William  and Queen  Mary  once under the Reign of King  William  and once under the Reign of Queen  Anne  The Necessity of this Law at this Time arose from the Prospect of an Invasion which has since broke out into an actual Rebellion and from Informations of secret and dangerous Practices among Men of considerable Figure who could not have been prevented from doing Mischief to their Countrey but by such a Suspension of this Act of Parliament  I cannot however but observe that notwithstanding the Lawfulness and Necessity of such a Suspension had not the Rebellion broke out after the passing of this Act of Parliament I do not know how those who had been the most  instrumental in procuring it could have escap'd that popular Odium which their malicious and artful Enemies have now in vain endeavoured to stir up against them Had it been possible for the Vigilance and Endeavours of a Ministry to have hindered even the Attempt of an Invasion their very Endeavours might have proved prejudicial to them Their prudent and resolute Precautions would have turned to their Disadvantage had they not been justified by those Events which they did all that was in their Power to obviate This naturally brings to Mind the Reflection of  Tully  in the like Circumstances  That  amidst the Divisions of  Rome a Man was in an unhappy Condition who had a Soare in the Administration nay even in the Preservation of the CommonWealth  O conditionem miseram non modo administrandae verum etiam conservandae Reipublicae  Besides every unprejudiced Man will consider how mildly and equitably this Power has been used The Persons confined have been treated with all possible Humanity and abridged of nothing but the Liberty of hurting their Countrey and very probably of ruining both themselves and their Families And as to the Numbers of those who are under this short Restraint it is very observable that People do not seem so much surpized at the Confinement of some as at the Liberty of many Others But we may from hence conclude what every  Englishman  must observe with great Pleasure that His Majesty does not in this great Point regulate Himself by any private Jealousies or Suspicions but by those Evidences and Informations which he has received  We have already found the good Consequences of this Suspension in that it has hindered the Rebellion from gathering the Strength it would otherwise have gained not to mention those Numbers it has kept from engaging in so desperate an Enterprize with the many Lives it has preserved and the Desolations it has prevented  For these and many other Reasons the Representatives of  Great Britain  in Parliament could never have answered it to the People they represent who have found such great Benefits from the Suspension of the  Habeas Corpus  Act and without it must have felt such fatal Consequences had they not in a Case of such great Necessity made Use of this customary legal and reasonable Method for Securing His Majesty on the Throne and their Countrey from Misery or Ruine  No Friday February  Hic Niger est hunc tu Romane caveto  Hor  WE are told that in  Turkey  when any Man is the Author of Notorious Falshoods it is usual to blacken the whole Front of his House Nay we have sometimes heard that an Embassador whose  Business it is  if I may quote his Character in Sir  Henry Wotton  's Words  to  for the Good of his Countrey  has sometimes had this Mark set upon his House when he  been detected in any Piece of feign'd Intelligence that has prejudiced the Government and misled the Minds of the People One cou'd almost wish that the Habitations of such of our own Countreymen as deal in Forgeties detrimental to the Publick were distinguished in the same Manner that their FellowSubjects might be cautioned not to be too easy in giving Credit to them Were such a Method put in Practice this Metropolis wou'd be strangely checquer'd some entire Parishes wou'd be in Mourning and several Streets darkned from one End to the other  But I have given my Thoughts in two preceding Papers both on the Inventors and the Believers of these publick Falshoods and Calumnies and shall here speak of that Contempt with which they are and ought to be received by those in high Stations at whom they are levell'd Any Person indeed who is zealous for promoting the Interest of his Countrey must conquer all that Tenderness and Delicacy which may make him afraid of being spoken ill of or his Endeavours will often produce no less Uneasiness to himself than Benefit to the Publick Among a People who indulge themselves in the utmost Freedoms of Thought and Speech a Man must either be insignificant or able to bear an undeserved Reproach A true Patriot may comfort himself under the Attacks of Falshood and Obloquy from several Motives and Reflections  In the first Place he shou'd consider that the chief of his Antagonists are generally acted by Spirit of Envy which wou'd not rise against him if it were not provoked by his Desert A Statesman who is possest of real Merit shou'd  look upon his political Censurers with the same Neglect that a good Writer regards his Criticks who are generally a Race of Men that are not able to discover the Beauties of a Work they examine and deny that Approbation to Others which they never met with themselves Patriots therefore shou'd rather rejoyce in the Success of their honest Designs than be mortified by those who misrepresent them  They shou'd likewise consider that not only Envy but Vanity has a Share in the Detraction of their Adversaries Such Aspersions therefore do them Honour at the same Time that they are intended to lessen their Reputation They shou'd reflect That those who endeavour to stir up the Multitude against them do it to be thought considerable and not a little applaud themselves in a Talent that can raise Clamours out of nothing and throw a Ferment among the People by Murmurs or Complaints which they know in their own Hearts are altogether groundless There is a pleasant Instance of this Nature recorded at length in the First Book of the Annals of  Tacitus  When a great Part of the  Roman  Legions were in a Disposition to mutiny an Impudent Varlet who was a private Centinel being mounted upon the Shoulders of his FellowSoldiers and resolved to try the Power of his Eloquence address'd himself to the Army in all the Postures of an Orator after the following Manner  You have given Liberty to these miserable Men  said he pointing to some Criminals whom they had rescued  but which of you can restore Life to my Brother    Who can give me back my Brother    He was murder'd no longer ago than  Night by the Hands of those Ru  ians who are eatertain'd by the General to butcher the poor S  ery  Tell me  Blaesus for that was the Name of the General who was then sitting on the Tribunal  tell me Where hast thou cast his dead Body    An Enemy does not grudge the Rites of Burial When I have tired my self with kissing his cold Corps and weeping over it order me to be slain upon it All I ask of my FellowSoldiers since we both dye in their Cause is that they wou'd lay me in the same Grave with my Brother  The whole Army was in an Uproar at this moving Speech and resolved to do the Speaker Justice when upon Enquiry they found that he never had a Brother in his Life and that he had stirred up the Sedition only to shew his Parts  Publick Ministers would likewise do well to consider that the principal Authors of such Reproaches as are cast upon them are those who have a Mind to get their Places And as for a Censure arising from this Motive it is in their Power to escape it when they please and turn it upon their Competitors Malecontents of an inferiour Character are acted by the same Principle for so long as there are Employments of all Sizes there will be Murmurers of all Degrees I have heard of a CountreyGentleman who made a very long and melancholy Complaint to the late Duke of  Buckingham  when he was in great Power at Court of several publick Grievances The Duke after having given him a very patient Hearing  My dear Friend  says he  this is but too true but I have thought of an Expedient which will set all Things right and that very soon  His Countrey Friend asked him what it was  You must know  says the Duke  there's a Place of five Hundred Pounds a Year fallen this very Morning which I  to put you in Possession of  The Gentleman  thanked his Grace went away satisfied and thought the Nation the happiest under Heaven during that whole Ministry  But farther every Man in a publick Station ought to consider that when there are two different Parties in a Nation they will see Things in different Lights An Action however conducive to the Good of their Countrey will be represented by the Artful and appear to the Ignorant as prejudicial to it Since I have here according to the usual Liberty of EssayWriters rambled into several Stories I shall fetch one to my present Purpose out of the  Persian  History We there read of a virtuous young Emperor who was very much afflicted to find his Actions misconstrued and defamed by a Party among his Subjects that favour'd another Interest As he was one Day sitting among the Ministers of his  Divan  and amusing himself after the  Eastern  Manner with the Solution of difficult Problems and Aenigma's he proposed to them in his Turn the following one  What is the Tree that bears three Hundred and sixty five Leaves which are all Black on the one Side and White on the other  His Grand Visier immediately replied it was the Year which consisted of three Hundred and sixty five Days and Nights  But Sir  says he  permit me at the same Time to take Notice that these Leaves represent your Actions which carry different Faces to your Friends and Enemies and will always appear black to those who are resolv'd only to look upon the wrong Side of 'em  A virtuous Man therefore who lays out his Endeavours for the Good of his Countrey should never be troubled at the Reports which are made of him so long as he is conscious of  his own Integrity He should rather be pleased to find People descanting upon his Actions because when they are thoroughly canvassed and examined they are sure in the End to turn to his Honour and Advantage The reasonable and unprejudiced Part of Mankind will be of his Side and rejoyce to see their common Interest lodged in such honest Hands A strict Examination of a great Man's Character is like the Trial of a suspected Chastity which was made among the  Jews  by the Waters of Jealousy  Moses  assures us that the Criminal burst upon the drinking of them but if she was accused wrongfully the  Rabbins  tell us they heighten'd her Charms and made her much more amiable than before So that they destroyed the Guilty but beautified the Innocent  No Monday February  Inopem me Copia fecit  Ovid  EVery  Englishman  will be a good Subject to King  George  in Proportion as he is a good  Englishman  and a Lover of the Constitution of his Countrey In Order to awaken in my Readers the Love of this their Constitution it may be necessary to set forth its superior Excellency to that Form of Government which many wicked and ignorant Men have of late Years endeavour'd to introduce among us I shall not therefore think it improper to take Notice from Time to Time of any particular Act of Power exerted by those among whom the Pretender  to His Majesty's Crown has been educated which wou'd prove fatal to this Nation shou'd it be Conquer'd and Govern'd by a Person who in all Probability wou'd put in Practice the Politicks in which he has been so long instructed  There has been nothing more observable in the Reign of His present  Gallick  Majesty than the Method he has taken for supplying his Exchequer with a necessary Sum of Money The Ways and Means for raising it has been an Edict or a Command in Writing signed by himself to encrease the Value of  Louis d' Ors  from Fourteen to Sixteen  Livres  by Virtue of a new Stamp which shall be struck upon them As this Method will bring all the Gold of the Kingdom into his Hands it is provided by the same Edict that they shall be payed out again to the People at Twenty  Livres  each so that Four  Livres  in the Score by this Means accrue to His Majesty out of all the Money in the Kingdom of  France  This Method of raising Money is consistent with that Form of Government and with the repeated Practice of their late  Grand Monarque  so that I shall not here consider the many evil Consequences which it must have upon their Trade their Exchange and publick Credit I shall only take Notice of the whimsical Circumstances a People must lie under who can be thus made poor or rich by an Edict which can throw an Alloy into a  Louis d' Or  and debase it into half its former Value or if His Majesty pleases raise the Price of it not by the Accession of Metal but of a Mark By the present Edict many a Man in  France  will swell into a Plumb who fell several Thousand Pounds  short of it the Day before its Publication This conveys a Kind of  Fairy  Treasure into their Chests even whilst they are under Lock and Key and is a Secret of Multiplication without Addition It is natural enough however for the Vanity of the  French  Nation to grow insolent upon this imaginary Wealth not considering that their Neighbours think them no more Rich by Virtue of an Edict to make Fourteen Twenty than they wou'd think 'em more formidable should there be another Edict to make every Man in the Kingdom Seven Foot high  It was usual for his late Most Christian Majesty to sink the Value of their  Louis d' Ors  about the Time he was to receive the Taxes of his good People and to raise them when he had got them safe into his Coffers And there is no Question but the present Government in that Kingdom will so far observe this Kind of Conduct as to reduce the Twenty  Livres  to their old Number of Fourteen when they have paid them out of their Hands which will immediately sink the present Timpany of Wealth and reestablish the natural Poverty of the  Gallick  Nation  One cannot but pity the melancholy Condition of a Miser in this Countrey who is perpetually telling his  Livres  without being able to know how Rich he is He is as ridiculously puzzled and perplexed as a Man that counts the Stones on  SalisburyPlain  which can never be settled to any certain Number but are more or fewer every Time he reckons them  I have heard of a young  French  Lady a Subject of  Louis  the Fourteenth who was contracted to a Marquis upon the Foot of a Five Thousand Pound Fortune which she had by her in  Specie but one of these unlucky Edicts coming out a Week before the intended Marriage she lost a Thousand Pound and her Bridegroom into the Bargain  The Uncertainty of Riches is a Subject much discoursed of in all Countries but may be insisted on more emphatically in  France  than any other A Man is here under such a Kind of Situation as One who is managed by a Jugler He fancies he has so many Pieces of Money in his Hand but let him grasp them never so carefully upon a Word or two of the Artist they encrease or dwindle to what Number the Doctor is pleased to name  This Method of lowering or advancing Money we who have the Happiness to be in another Form of Government should look upon as an unwarrantable Kind of Clipping and Coining However as it is an Expedient that is often practised and may be justify'd in that Constitution which has been so thoroughly studied by the Pretender to His Majesty's Crown I do not see what should have hinder'd him from making Use of so expeditious a Method for raising a Supply if he had succeeded in his late Attempt to dethrone His Majesty and subvert our Constitution I shall leave it to the Consideration of the Reader if in such a Case the following Edict or something very like it might not have been expected  'WHereas these our Kingdoms have long groaned under an expensive and consuming LandWar which has very much exhausted the Treasure of the Nation we being willing to increase the Wealth of our People and not thinking it advisable for this Purpose  to make Use of the tedious Methods of Merchandise and Commerce which have been always promoted by a Faction among the worst of our Subjects and were so wisely discountenanc'd by the best of them in the late Reign do hereby Enact by our sole Will and Pleasure that every Shilling in  GreatBritain  shall pass in all Payments for the Sum of fourteen Pence till the first of  September  next and that every other Piece of Money shall rise and pass in current Payment in the same Proportion The Advantage which will accrue to these Nations by this our Royal Donative will visibly appear to all Men of sound Principles who are so justly famous for their Antipathy to Strangers and would not see the Landed Interest of their Countrey weaken'd by the Importations of Foreign Gold and Silver But since by Reason of the great Debts which we have contracted Abroad during our fifteen Years Reign as well as of our present Exigencies it will be necessary to fill our Exchequer by the most prudent and expeditious Methods we do also hereby order every one of our Subjects to bring in these his fourteenpenny Pieces and all the other current Cash of this Kingdom by what new Titles soever dignified or distinguished to the Master of our Mint who after having set a Mark upon them shall deliver out to them on or after the first of  September  aforesaid their respective Sums taking only Four Pence for our self for such his Mark on every Fourteen Penny Piece which from henceforth shall pass in Payment for Eighteen Pence and so in Proportion for the rest By this Method the Money of this Nation will be more  by one Third than it is at present and we shall content our self with not quite one Fifth Part of the Current Cash of our loving Subjects which will but barely suffice to clear the Interest of those Sums in which we stand indebted to our most dear Brother and ancient Ally We are glad of this Opportunity of shewing such an Instance of our Goodness to our Subjects by this our Royal Edict which shall be Read in every Parish Church of  GreatBritain  immediately after the Celebration of High Mass  FOR SUCH IS OUR PLEASURE  '  No Friday February  Pulchrum est bene facere reipublicae etiam bene dicere haud absurdum est  Sall  IT has been usual these many Years for Writers who have approved the Scheme of Government which has taken Place to explain to the People the Reasonableness of those Principles which have prevailed and to justify the Conduct of those who act in Conformity to such Principles It therefore happens well for the Party which is undermost when a Work of this Nature falls into the Hands of those who content themselves to attack their Principles without exposing their Persons or singling out any particular Objects for Satyr and Ridicule This Manner of Proceeding is no inconsiderable Piece of Merit in Writers who  are often more influenc'd by a Desire of Fame than a Regard to the publick Good and who by this Means lose many fair Opportunities of shewing their own Wit or of gratifying the IllNature of their Readers  When a Man thinks a Party engaged in such Measures as tend to the Ruine of his Countrey it is certainly a very laudable and virtuous Action in him to make War after this Manner upon the whole Body But as several Casuists are of Opinion that in a Battel you shou'd discharge upon the Gross of the Enemy without levelling your Piece at any particular Person so in this Kind of Combat also I cannot think it fair to aim at any one Man and make his Character the Mark of your Hostilities There is now to be seen in the Castle of  Milan  a CannonBullet inscribed  This to the Mareschal de Crequi  which was the very Ball that shot him An Author who points his Satyr at a Great Man is to be looked upon in the same View with the Engineer who signalized himself by this ungenerous Practice  But as the Spirit of the  Whigs  and  Tories  shews itself upon every Occasion to be very widely different from one another so is it particularly visible in the Writings of this Kind which have been published by each Party The latter may indeed assign one Reason to justify themselves in this Practice that having nothing of any Manner of Weight to offer against the Principles of their Antagonists if they speak at all it must be against their Persons When they cannot refute an Adversary the shortest Way is to libel him and to endeavour at the making his Person odious when they cannot represent his Notions as absurd  The  Examiner  was a Paper in the last Reign which was the FavouriteWork of the Party It was usher'd into the World by a Letter from a Secretary of State setting forth the great Genius of the Author the Usefulness of his Design and the mighty Consequences that were to be expected from it It is said to have been written by those among 'em whom they looked upon as their most celebrated Wits and Politicians and was dispersed into all Quarters of the Nation with great Industry and Expence Who would not have expected that at least the Rules of Decency and Candour would be observed in such a Performance But instead of this you saw all the great Men who had done eminent Services to their Countrey but a few Years before draughted out one by one and baited in their Turns No Sanctity of Character or Privilege of Sex exempted Persons from this barbarous Usage Several of our Prelates were the standing Marks of publick Raillery and many Ladies of the first Quality branded by Name for Matters of Fact which as they were false were not heeded and if they had been true were innocent The Dead themselves were not spared And here I cannot forbear taking Notice of a Kind of Wit which has lately grown into Fashion among the Versifiers Epigrammatists and other Authors who think it sufficient to distinguish themselves by their Zeal for what they call the HighChurch while they sport with the most tremendous Parts of Revealed Religion Every one has seen Epigrams upon the deceased Fathers of our Church where the whole Thought has turned upon HellFire Patriots who ought to be remember'd with Honour by their Posterity have been introduced  as Speakers in a State of Torments There is something dreadful even in repeating these execrable Pieces of Wit which no Man who really believes in another Life can peruse without Fear and Trembling It is astonishing to see Readers who call themselves Christians applauding such Diabolical Mirth and seeming to rejoyce in the Doom which is pronounced against their Enemies by such abandoned Scriblers A Wit of this Kind may with great Truth be compared to the Fool in the  Proverbs    who plays with Arrows Firebrands and Death and says am I not in Sport    I must in Justice to the more sober and considerate of that Party confess that many of them were highly scandalized at that Personal Slander and Reflection which was flung out so freely by the Libellers of the last Reign as well as by those profane Liberties which have been since continued And as for those who are either the Authors or Admirers of such Compositions I would have them consider with themselves whether the Name of a good Churchman can attone for the want of that Charity which is the most essential Part of Christianity They would likewise do well to reflect how by these Methods the Poison has run freely into the Minds of the Weak and Ignorant heightned their Rage against many of their FellowSubjects and almost divested them of the common Sentiments of Humanity  In the former Part of this Paper I have hinted that the Design of it is to oppose the Principles of those who are Enemies to the present Government and the main Body of that Party who espouse those Principles But even in such general Attacks there are certain Measures  to be kept which may have a Tendency rather to gain than to irritate those who differ with you in their Sentiments The  Examiner  would not allow such as were of a contrary Opinion to him to be either Christians or FellowSubjects With him they were all Atheists Deists or Apostates and a separate CommonWealth among themselves that ought either to be extirpated or when he was in a better Humour only to be banished out of their Native Countrey They were often put in mind of some approaching Execution and therefore all of them advised to prepare themselves for it as Men who had then nothing to take care of but how to die decently In short the  Examiner  seemed to make no distinction between Conquest and Destruction  The Conduct of this Work has hitherto been regulated by different Views and shall continue to be so unless the Party it has to deal with draw upon themselves another kind of Treatment For if they shall persist in pointing their Batteries against particular Persons there are no Laws of War that forbid the making of Reprisals In the mean time this Undertaking shall be managed with that generous Spirit which was so remarkable among the  Romans  who did not subdue a Countrey in order to put the Inhabitants to Fire and Sword but to incorporate them into their own Community and make them happy in the same Government with themselves  No Monday February  Privatus illis Census erat brevis  Commune magnum  Hor  IT is very unlucky for those who make it their Business to raise Popular Murmurs and Discontents against His Majesty's Government that they find so very few and so very improper Occasions for them To shew how hard they are set in this Particular there are several who for want of other Materials are forced to represent the Bill which has passed this Session for laying an additional Tax of Two Shillings in the Pound upon Land as a kind of Grievance upon the Subject If this be a Matter of Complaint it ought in Justice to fall upon those who have made it necessary Had there been no Rebellion there would have been no Increase of the LandTax so that in Proportion as a Man declares his Aversion to the one he ought to testify his Abhorrence of the other But it is very remarkable that those who would persuade the People that they are aggrieved by this additional Burthen are the very Persons who endeavour in their ordinary Conversation to extenuate the Hainousness of the Rebellion and who express the greatest Tenderness for the Persons of the Rebels They shew a particular Indulgence for that unnatural Insurrection which has drawn this Load upon as and are angry at the Means which were necessary for suppressing it There needs no clearer  Proof of the Spirit and Intention with which they act I shall therefore advise my FellowFreeHolders to consider the Character of any Person who would possess them with the Notion of a Hardship that is put upon the Countrey by this Tax If he be one of known Affection to the present Establishment they may imagine there is some Reason for Complaint But if on the contrary he be one who has shewn himself Indifferent as to the Success of the present Rebellion or is suspected as a private Abettor of it they may take it for granted his Complaint against the LandTax is either the Rage of a disappointed Man or the Artifice of one who would alienate their Affections from the present Government  The Expence which will arise to the Nation from this Rebellion is already computed at near a Million And it is a melancholy Consideration for the FreeHolders of  Great Britain  that the Treason of their FellowSubjects should bring upon them as great a Charge as the War with  France  At the same Time every reasonable Man among them will pay a Tax with at least as great Chearfulness for stifling a Civil War in its Birth as for carrying on a War in a Foreign Countrey Had not our first Supplies been effectual for the crushing of our Domestick Enemies we should immediately have beheld the whole Kingdom a Scene of Slaughter and Desolation Whereas if we had failed in our first Attempts upon a distant Nation we might have repaired the Losses of one Campaign by the Advantages of another and after several Victories gained over us might still have kept the Enemy from our Gates  As it was thus absolutely necessary to raise a Sum that might enable the Government to put a speedy Stop to the Rebellion so could there be no Method thought of for raising such a Sum more proper than this of laying an additional Tax of Two Shillings in the Pound upon Land  In the first Place This Tax has already been so often tried that we know the exact Produce of it which in any new Project is always very doubtful and uncertain As we are thus acquainted with the Produce of this Tax we find this adequate to the Services for which  is designed and that the additional Tax is proportioned to the Supernumerary Expence which falls upon the Kingdom this Year by the unnatural Rebellion as it has been above stated  In the next Place No other Tax could have been thought of upon which so much Money would have been immediately advanced as was necessary in so critical a Juncture for pushing our Successes against the Rebels and preventing the Attempts of their Friends and Confederates both at Home and Abroad No Body cares to make Loans upon a new and untried Project whereas Men never fail to bring in their Money upon a LandTax when the Praemium or  nterest allowed them is suited to the Hazard  hey run by such Loans to the Government And here one cannot but bewail the Misfortune of our Countrey when we consider that the House of Commons had last Year reduced this  nterest to Four  per Cent  by which Means there was a considerable Saving to the Nation but  hat this Year they have been forced to give Six  per Cent  as well knowing the fatal Consequences that might have ensued had there not  een an Interest allowed which would certainly  encourage the Lender to venture in such a Time of Danger what was indispensably necessary for the Exigences of the Publick  Besides This is a Method for raising a Sum of Money that with the ordinary Taxes will in all Probability defray the whole Expence of the Year So that there is no Burden laid upon our Posterity who have been sufficiently loaded by other Means of raising Money nor any Deficiency to be hereafter made up by our selves which has been our Case in so many other Subsidies  To this we may add That we have no Example of any other Tax which in its Nature would so particularly affect the Enemies to His Majesty's Government Multitudes of  Papists  and  Nonjurors  will be obliged to furnish a double Proportion out of their Revenues towards the clearing of that Expence which by their open and secret Practices they have been Instrumental in bringing upon their FellowSubjects  I shall only mention one Consideration more That no other Tax is so likely to cease as this is when there is no farther Occasion for it This Tax is established by a House of Commons which by Virtue of an Act of Parliament passed a few Years ago must consist for the most Part of Landed Men so that a great Share of the Weight of it must necessarily fall upon the Members of their own Body As this is an Instance of their Publick Spirit so we may be sure they would not have exerted it had there not been an absolute Necessity Nor can we doubt that for the same Reasons when this Necessity ceases they will take the first Opportunity of easing themselves in this Particular  as well as those whom they represent It is a celebrated Notion of a Patriot who signally distinguished himself for the Liberties of his Countrey That a House of Commons should never grant such Subsidies as are easy to be raised and give no Pain to the People lest the Nation should acquiesce under a Burden they did not feel and see it perpetuated without repining Whether this Notion might not be too refined I shall not determine but by what has been already said I think we may promise our selves that this additional Tax of Two Shillings in the Pound will not be continued another Year because we may hope the Rebellion will be entirely ended in This  And here I believe it must be obvious to every one's Reflection that the Rebellion might not have concluded so soon had not this Method been made use of for that End A foreign Potentate trembles at the Thought of entering into a War with so wealthy an Enemy as the  British  Nation when he finds the whole Landed Interest of the Kingdom engaged to oppose him with their united Force and at all Times ready to employ against him such a Part of their Revenues as shall be sufficient to baffle his Designs upon their Countrey Especially when none can imagine that he expects any Encouragement from those whose Fortunes are either lodged in the Funds or employed in Trade  The Wisdom therefore of the present House of Commons has by this Tax not only enabled the King to subdue those of his own Subjects who have been actually in Arms against him but to divert any of his Neighbours from the Hopes of lending them a competent Assistance  No Friday March  Qualis in Eurotae ripis aut per juga Cynthi  Exercet Diana choros quam mille secutae  Hinc atque hinc glomerantur Oreades illa pharetram  Fert humero gradiens{que} Deas supereminet omnes  Virg  IT is not easy for any one who saw the Magnificence of Yesterday in the Court of  Great Britain  to turn his Thoughts for some time after on any other Subject It was a Solemnity every way suited to the BirthDay of a Princess who is the Delight of our Nation and the Glory of her Sex  Homer  tells us that when the Daughter of  Jupiter  presented herself among a Crowd of Goddesses she was distinguished from the rest by her graceful Stature and known by her superiour Beauty notwithstanding they were all beautiful Such was the Appearance of the Princess of  Wales  among our  British  Ladies or to use a more solemn Phrase of  the King's Daughter among her honourable Women  Her Royal Highness in the midst of such a Circle raises in the Beholder the Idea of a fine Picture where notwithstanding the Diversity of pleasing Objects that fill up the Canvas the principal Figure immediately takes the Eye and fixes the Attention  When this excellent Princess was yet in her Father's Court she was so celebrated for the Beauty of her Person and the Accomplishments  of her Mind that there was no Prince in the Empire who had room for such an Alliance that was not ambitious of gaining her into his Family either as a Daughter or as a Consort He who is now the Chief of the Crowned Heads in  Europe  and was then King of  Spain  and Heir to all the Dominions of the House of  Austria  sought her in Marriage Could her Mind have been captivated with the Glories of this World she had them all laid before her but she generously declined them because she saw the Acceptance of them was inconsistent with what she esteems more than all the Glories of this World the Enjoyment of her Religion Providence however kept in Store a Reward for such an exalted Vertue and by the secret Methods of its Wisdom opened a Way for her to become the Greatest of her Sex among those who profess that Faith to which she adhered with so much Christian Magnanimity  This her illustrious Conduct might in the Eye of the World have lost its Merit had so accomplished a Prince as his Royal Highness declared his Passion for the same Alliance at that time It would then have been no Wonder that all other Proposals had been rejected But it was the Fame of this heroick Constancy that determined his Royal Highness to desire in Marriage a Princess whose personal Charms which had before been so universally admired were now become the least Part of her Character We of the  British  Nation have reason to rejoice that such a Proposal was made and accepted and that her Royal Highness with regard to these two successive Treaties of Marriage shewed as much Prudence in her Compliance  with the one as Piety in her Refusal of the other  The Princess was no sooner arrived at  Hanover  than she improved the Lustre of that Court which was before reckoned among the Politest in  Europe  and increased the Satisfaction of that People who were before looked upon as the Happiest in the Empire She immediately became the Darling of the Princess  Sophia  who was acknowledged in all the Courts of  Europe  the most accomplished Woman of the Age in which she lived and who was not a little pleased with the Conversation of one in whom she saw so lively an Image of her own Youth  But I shall insist no longer on that Reputation which Her Royal Highness has acquired in other Countries We daily discover those admirable Qualities for which she is so justly famed and rejoyce to see them exerted in our own Countrey where we our selves are made happy by their Influence We are the more pleased to behold the Throne of these Kingdoms surrounded by a numerous and beautiful Progeny when we consider the Virtues of those from whom they descend Not only the Features but the Mind of the Parent is often copied out in the Offspring But the Princess we are speaking of takes the surest Method of making her Royal Issue like herself by instilling early into their Minds all the Principles of Re+ligion Virtue and Honour and seasoning thei  tender Years with all that Knowledge which they are capable of receiving What may  not hope from such an uncommon Care in  Education of the Children of  Great Britain    are directed by such Precepts and will be  +ed by such an Example  The Conjugal Virtues are so remarkable in her Royal Highness as to deserve those just and generous Returns of Love and Tenderness for which the Prince her Husband is so universally celebrated  But there is no Part of her Royal Highness's Character which we observe with greater Pleasure than that Behaviour by which she has so much endear'd herself to His Majesty tho' indeed we have no Reason to be surprized at this mutual Intercourse of Duty and Affection when we consider so wise and virtuous a Princess possessing in the same sacred Person the kindest of Fathers and the best of Kings And here it is natural for us to congratulate our own good Fortune who see our Soveraign blest with a numerous Issue among whom are Heirs Male in two direct Descents which has not happened in the Reign of any  English  King since the Time of His Majesty's Great Ancestor  Edward  III and is a Felicity not enjoyed by the Subjects of any other of the Kings of  Europe  who are his Contemporaries We are like Men entertained with the View of a spacious Landskip where the Eye passes over one pleasing Prospect into another till the Sight is lost by degrees in a Succession of delightful Objects and leaves us in the Persuasion that there remain still more behind  But if we regard her Royal Highness in that Light which diffuses the greatest Glory round a Humane Character we shall find the Christian no less conspicuous than the Princess She is as eminent for a sincere Piety in the Practice of Religion as for an inviolable Adherence to its Principles She is constant in her Attendance on the daily Offices of our Church and by her  serious and devout Comportment on these solemn Occasions gives an Example that is very often too much wanted in Courts  Her Religion is equally free from the Weakness of Superstition and the Sourness of Enthusiasm It is not of that uncomfortable melancholy Nature which disappoints its own End by appearing unamiable to those whom it would gain to its Interests It discovers itself in the genuine Effects of Christianity in Affability Compassion Benevolence Evenness of Mind and all the Offices of an active and universal Charity  As a cheerful Temper is the necessary Result of these Virtues so it shines out in all the Parts of her Conversation and dissipates those Apprehensions which naturally hang on the Timorous or the Modest when they are admitted to the Honour of her Presence There is none that does not listen with Pleasure to a Person in so high a Station who condescends to make herself thus agreeable by Mirth without Levity and Wit without Ill Nature  Her Royal Highness is indeed possest of all those Talents which make Conversation either delightful or improving As she has a fine Taste of the elegant Arts and is skilled in several modern Languages her Discourse is not confined to the ordinary Subjects or Forms of Conversation but can adapt itself with an uncommon Grace to every Occasion and entertain the politest Persons of different Nations I need not mention what is observed by every one that agreeable Turn which appears in her Sentiments upon the most ordinary Affairs of Life and which is so suitable to the Delicacy of her Sex the Politeness of her Education and the Splendor of her Quality  It would be vain to think of drawing into the Compass of this Paper the many eminent Virtues which adorn the Character of this Great Princess but as it is one chief End of this Undertaking to make the People sensible of the Blessings which they enjoy under His Majesty's Reign I could not but lay hold on this Opportunity to speak of That which ought in Justice to be reckoned among the greatest of them  No Monday March  Studiis rudis sermone barbarus impetu strenuus manu promptus cogitatione celer  Vell Paterc  FOR the Honour of His Majesty and the Safety of His Government we cannot but observe that those who have appeared the greatest Enemies to both are of that Rank of Men who are commonly distinguished by the Title of  Foxhunters  As several of these have had no Part of their Education in Cities Camps or Courts it is doubtful whether they are of greater Ornament or Use to the Nation in which they live It would be an everlasting Reproach to Politicks should such Men be able to overturn an Establishment which has been formed by the wisest Laws and is supported by the ablest Heads The wrong Notions and Prejudices which cleave to many of these CountreyGentlemen who have always  out of the way of being better informed are not easy to be conceived by a Person who has never conversed with them  That I may give my Readers an Image of these Rural Statesmen I shall without farther Preface set down an Account of a Discourse I chanced to have with one of them some Time ago I was Travelling towards one of the remote Parts of  England  when about Three aClock in the Afternoon seeing a CountreyGentleman trotting before me with a Spaniel by his Horse's Side I made up to him Our Conversation opened as usual upon the Weather in which we were very unanimous having both agreed that it was too dry for the Season of the Year My FellowTraveller upon this observed to me that there had been no good Weather since the Revolution I was a little startled at so extraordinary a Remark but would not interrupt him till he proceeded to tell me of the fine Weather they used to have in King  Charles  the Second's Reign I only answered that I did not see how the Badness of the Weather could be the King's Fault and without waiting for his Reply asked him whose House it was we saw upon a RisingGround at a little Distance from us He told me it belonged to an old Fanatical Cur Mr Such a one  You must have heard of him  says he  He's one of the Rump  I knew the Gentleman's Character upon hearing his Name but assured him that to my Knowledge he was a good Churchman  Ay  says he with a kind of Surprize  We were told in the Countrey that he spoke twice in the Queen's Time against taking of the Duties upon  French  Claret  This naturall  led us into the Proceedings of late Parliaments▪ upon which Occasion he affirmed roundly tha  there had not been one good Law passed sinc  King  William  's Accession to the Throne excep  the Act for preserving the Game I had a mind to see him out and therefore did not care for contradicting him  Is it not hard  says he  that honest Gentlemen should be taken into Custody of Messengers to prevent them from acting according to their Consciences    But  says he  what can we expect when a Parcel of Factious Sons of Whores  He was going on in great Passion but chanced to miss his Dog who was amusing himself about a Bush that grew at some Distance behind us We stood still till he had whistled him up when he fell into a long Panegyrick upon his Spaniel who seem'd indeed excellent in his Kind But I found the most remarkable Adventure of his Life was that he had once like to have worried a DissentingTeacher The Master could hardly sit on his Horse for laughing all the while he was giving me the Particulars of this Story which I found had mightily endeared his Dog to him and as he himself told me had made him a great Favourite among all the honest Gentlemen of the Countrey We were at length diverted from this Piece of Mirth by a PostBoy who winding his Horn at us my Companion gave him two or three Curses and left the Way clear for him  I fancy  said  I    that Post brings News from  Scotland  I shall long to see the next  Gazette  Sir  says he  I make it a Rule never to believe any of your printed News We never see Sir how Things go except now and then in  Dyer'  s Letter and I read that more for the Style than the News The Man has a  Pen it must be own'd But is it not  that we should be making War upon Church  England  Men with  Dutch  and  Swiss  Soldiers Men of Antimonarchical Principles    These Foreigners will never be loved in  England  Sir    they have not  that Wit and GoodBreeding that we have  I must confess I did not expect to hear my new Acquaintance value himself upon these Qualifications but finding him such a Critick upon Foreigners I ask'd him if he had ever Travelled He told me he did not know what Travelling was good for but to teach a Man to ride the Great Horse to jabber  French  and to talk against PassiveObedience To which he added that he scarce ever knew a Traveller in his Life who had not forsook his Principles and lost his HuntingSeat  For my Part  says he  I and my Father before me have always been for PassiveObedience and shall be always for opposing a Prince who makes use of Ministers that are of another Opinion But where do you intend to Inn to Night  for we were now come in Sight of the next Town  I can help you to a very good Landlord if you will go along with me He's a lusty jolly Fellow that lives well at least three Yards in the Girt and the best Church of  England  Man upon the Road  I had a Curiosity to see this HighChurch Innkeeper as well as to enjoy more of the Conversation of my FellowTraveller and therefore readily consented to set our Horses together for that Night As we rode Side by Side through the Town I was let into the Characters of all the principal Inhabitants whom we met in our Way One was a Dog another a Whelp another a Cut and another the Soa of a Bitch under which several Denominations were comprehended all that Voted on the  Whi  Side in the last Election of Burgesses As for those of his own Party he distinguished then by a Nod of his Head and asking them how they did by their Christian Names Upon on Arrival at the Inn my Companion fetch'  out the jolly Landlord who knew him by his Whistle Many Endearments and private Whispers passed between them tho' it was easy to see by the Landlord's scratching his Head that Things did not go to their Wishes The Landlord had swell'd his Body to a prodigious Size and work'd up his Complexion to a standing Crimson by his Zeal for the Prosperity of the Church which he expressed every Hour of the Day as his Customers dropt in by repeated Bumpers He had not time to go to Church himself but as my Friend told me in my Ear had headed a Mob at the pulling down of two or three Meetinghouses While Supper was preparing he enlarged upon the Happiness of the neighbouring Shire  For  says he  there is scarce a Preshyterian in the whole County except the Bishop  In short I found by his Discourse that he had learned a great deal of Politicks but not one Word of Religion from the Parson of his Parish and indeed that he had scarce any other Notion of Religion but that it consisted in Hating Presbyterians I had a remarkable Instance of his Notions in this Particular Upon seeing a poor decrepid Old Woman pass under the Window where we fate he desired me to take Notice of her and afterwards informed me that she was generally reputed a Witch by the Countrey People but that for his Part he was apt to believe she was a Presbyterian  Supper was no sooner served in than he took occasion from a Shoulder of Mutton that lay before us to cry up the Plenty of  England  which would be the happiest Countrey in the World provided we would live within our selves Upon which he expatiated on the Inconveniencies  of Trade that carried from us the Commodities of our Countrey and made a Parcel of Upstarts as rich as Men of the most ancient Families of  England  He then declared frankly that he had always been against all Treaties and Alliances with Foreigners  Our Wooden Walls  says he  are our Security and we may bid Defiance to the whole World especially if they should attack us when the Militia is out  I ventured to reply that I had as great an Opinion of the  English  Fleet as he had but I could not see how they could be pay'd and mann'd and fitted out unless we encouraged Trade and Navigation He replied with some Vehemence That he would undertake to prove Trade would be the Ruine of the  English  Nation I would fain have put him upon it but he contented himself with affirming it more eagerly to which he added two or three Curses upon the  London  Merchants not forgetting the Directors of the Bank After Supper he asked me if I was an Admirer of Punch and immediately called for a Sneaker I took this Occasion to insinuate the Advantages of Trade by observing to him that Water was the only Native of  England  that could be made use of on this Occasion But that the Lemons the Brandy the Sugar and the Nutmeg were all Foreigners This put him into some Confusion but the Landlord who overheard me brought him off by affirming That for constant use there was no Liquor like a Cup of  English  Water provided it had Malt enough in it My Squire laughed heartily at the Conceit and made the Landlord sit down with us We sate pretty late over our Punch and amidst a great deal of improving Discourse drank the Healths of several Persons in the Countrey  whom I had never heard of that they both assur'd me were the ablest Statesmen in the Nation And of some  Londoners  whom they extoll'd to the Skies for their Wit and who I knew passed in Town for silly Fellows It being now Midnight and my Friend perceiving by his Almanack that the Moon was up he called for his Horses and took a sudden Resolution to go to his House which was at three Miles distance from the Town after having bethought himself that he never slept well out of his own Bed He shook me very heartily by the Hand at parting and discover'd a great Air of Satisfaction in his Looks that he had met with an Opportunity of shewing his Parts and left me a much wiser Man than he found me  No Friday March  Illis ira modum supra est et saepe venenum  Morsibus inspirant  Virg  IN the Wars of  Europe  which were waged among our Forefathers it was usual for the Enemy when there was a King in the Field to demand by a Trumpet in what Part of the Camp he resided that they might avoid firing upon the Royal Pavillion Our PartyContests in  England  were hertofore managed with the same kind of Decency and GoodBreeding The Person of the Prince was always looked upon as Sacred and whatever severe Usage his Friends or Ministers met with none presumed to direct their Hostilities at their Soveraign  The Enemies of our present Settlement are of such a coarse kind of Make and so equally void of Loyalty and Good Manners that they are grown Scurrilous upon the Royal Family and treat the most exalted Characters with the most opprobrious Language  This Petulance in Conversation is particularly observed to prevail among some of that Sex where it appears the most unbecoming and the most unnatural Many of these act with the greater Licentiousness because they know they can act with the greater Impunity This Confideration indeed engages the most generous and wellbred even of our She Malecontents to make no ill Use of the Indulgence of our Lawgivers and to discover in their Debates at least the Delicacy of the Woman if not the Duty of the Subject But it is generally remarked that every one of them who is a Shrew in domestick Life is now become a Scold in Politicks And as for those of the Party who are of a superior Rank and unblemished Virtue it must be a melancholy Reflexion for them to consider that all the Common Women of the Town are of their Side for which Reason they ought to preserve a more than ordinary Modesty in their Satyrical Excursions that their Characters may not be liable to Suspicion  If there is not some Method found out for allaying these Heats and Animosities among the Fair Sex one does not know to what Outrages they may proceed I remember a Heroe in  Scarron  who finding himself opposed by a mix'd Multitude of both Sexes with a great deal of virulent Language after having brought them to a Submission gave Order to keep them from doing farther Mischief that the Men should be  disarmed of their Clubs and that the Women should have their Nails pared We are not yet reduced to the Necessity of applying such violent Remedies but as we daily receive Accounts of Ladies batteling it on both Sides and that those who appear against the Constitution make War upon their Antagonists by many unfair Practices and unwarrantable Methods I think it is very convenient there should be a Cartel settled between them If they have not yet agreed upon any thing of this Nature among themselves I would propose to them the following Plan in which I have sketched out several Rules suited to the politest Sex in one of the most civilized Nations  THAT in every Political Rencounter between Woman and Woman no Weapon shall be made use of but the Tongue  That in the Course of the Engagement if either of the Combatants finding herself hard prest by her Adversary shall proceed to personal Reflexions or Discovery of Secrets they shall be parted by the Standers by  That when both Sides are drawn up in a full Assembly it shall not be lawful for above Five of them to talk at the same Time  That if any shall detract from a Lady's Character unless she be absent the said Detractness shall be forth with ordered to the lowest place of the Room  That none presume to speak disrespectfully of His Majesty or any of the Royal Family on Pain of three Hours Silence  That none be permitted to talk spightfully of the Court unless they can produce Vouchers that they have been there  That the making use of News which goes about in Whisper unless the Author be produced or the Fact well attested shall be deemed Fighting with white Powder and contrary to the Laws of War  That any one who produces Libels or Lampoons shall be regarded in the same manner as one who shoots with poisoned Bullets  That when a Lady is throughly convinced of the Falshood of any Story she has related she shall give her Parole not to tell it for a certain Truth that Winter  That when any Matter of Doubt arises which cannot otherwise be decided Appeal shall be made to a Toast if there be any such in the Company  That no Coquette notwithstanding she can do it with a good Air shall be allowed to Sigh for the Danger of the Church or to shiver at the Apprehensions of Fanaticism  That when a Woman has talked an Hour and a half it shall be lawful to call her down to Order  As this Civil Discord among the Sisterhood of  Great Britain  is likely to engage them in a long and lingring War consisting altogether of Drawn Battels it is the more necessary that there should be a Cartel settled among them Besides as our  English  Ladies are at present the greatest Stateswomen in  Europe  they will be in danger of making themselves the most unamiable Part of their Sex if they continue to give a Loose to intemperate Language and to a low kind of Ribaldry which is not used among the Women of Fashion in any other Countrey  Discretion and good Nature have been always looked upon as the distinguishing Ornaments of  Female Conversation The Woman  whose Price is above Rubies  has no Particular in the Character given of her by the Wise Man more endearing than that  she openeth her Mouth with Wisdom and in her Tongne is the Law of Kindness  Besides every fierce SheZealot should consider that however any of the other Sex may seem to applaud her as a Partisan there is none of them who would not be afraid of associating himself with her in any of the more private Relations of Life  I shall only add that there is no Talent so pernicious as Eloquence to those who have it not under Command For which Reason Women who are so liberally gifted by Nature in this Particular ought to study with the greatest Application the Rules of Female Oratory delivered in that excellent Treatise entitul'd  The Government of the Tongue  Had that Author foreseen the Political Ferment which is now raised among the Sex he would probably have made his Book larger by some Chapters than it is at present But what is wanting in that Work may I hope in some Measure be supplyed by the abovewritten Cartel  No Monday March  Bellum importunum cives cum gente deorum  Invictisque viris geritis  Virg  A Physician makes Use of various Methods for the Recovery of sick Persons and tho' some of them are painful and all of them disagreeable  his Patients are never angry at him because they know he has nothing in View besides the restoring of them to a good State of Health I am forced to treat the disaffected Part of His Majesty's Subjects in the same Manner and may therefore reasonably expect the same Returns of GoodWill I propose nothing to my self but their Happiness as the End of all my Endeavours and am forced to adapt different Remedies to those different Constitutions which are to be found in such a distemper'd Multitude Some of them can see the unreasonable and some of them the ridiculous Side of wrong Principles and according to the different Frame of their Minds reject an Opinion as it carries in it either the Appearance of Wickedness or of Danger or of Folly  I have endeavoured to expose in these several Lights the Notions and Practices of those who are the Enemies to our present Establishment But there is a Set of Arguments which I have not yet touched upon and which often succeed when all others fail There are many who will not quit a Project tho' they find it pernicious or absurd But will readily desist from it when they are convinced it is impracticable An Attempt to subvert the present Government is God be thanked of this Nature I shall therefore apply the Considerations of this Paper rather to the Discretion than the Virtue of our Malecontents who should act in the present Juncture of Affairs like experienced Gamesters that throw up their Cards when they know the Game is in the Enemy's Hand without giving themselves any unnecessary Vexation in playing it out  In the Reign of our two last  British  Soveraigns those who did not favour their Interest might be ungenerous enough to act upon the Prospect of a Change considering the precarious Condition of their Health and their Want of Issue to succeed them But at present we enjoy a King of a longlived Family who is in the Vigour of his Age and blest with a numerous Progeny To this we may add his remarkable Steadiness in adhering to those Schemes which he has formed upon the maturest Deliberation and that submissive Deference of his Royal Highness both from Duty and Inclination to all the Measures of his Royal Father Nor must we omit that personal Valour so peculiar to His Majesty and his Illustrious House which would be sufficient to vanquish as we find it actually deters both his foreign and domestick Enemies  This Great Prince is supported by the whole Protestant Interest of  Europe  and strengthened with a long Range of Alliances that reach from one End of the Continent to the other He has a great and powerful King for his SoninLaw and can Himself command when he pleases the whole Strength of an Electorate in the Empire Such a Combination of Soveraigns puts one in Mind of the Apparition of Gods which discouraged  Aeneas  from opposing the Will of Heaven When his Eyes were cleared of that mortal Cloud which hung upon them he saw the several Celestial Deities acting in a Confederacy against him and immediately gave up a Cause which was excluded from all Possibility of Success  But it is the greatest Happiness as well as the greatest Pleasure of our Soveraign that his  chief Strength lies in his own Kingdoms Both the Branches of our Legislature espouse his Cause and Interest with a becoming Duty and Zeal The most considerable and wealthy of his Subjects are convinced that the Prosperity of our Soveraign and his People are inseparable And we are very well satisfied that his Majesty if the Necessity of Affairs should require it might find among the most dutiful of his Subjects Men celebrated for their military Characters above any of the Age in which they live There is no Question but his Majesty will be as generally valued and beloved in his  British  as he is in his  German  Dominions when he shall have Time to make his Royal Virtues equally known among us In the mean while we have the Satisfaction to find that his Enemies have been only able to make ill Impressions upon the low and ignorant Rabble of the Nation and to put the Dregs of the People into a Ferment  We have already seen how poor and contemptible a Force has been raised by those who have dared to appear openly against his Majesty and how they were headed and encouraged by Men whose Sense of their Guilt made them desperate in forming so rash an Enterprize and dispirited in the Execution of it But we have not yet seen that Strength which would be exerted in the Defence of His Majesty the Protestant Religion and the  British  Liberties were the Danger great enough to require it Should the King be reduced to the Necessity of setting up the Royal Standard how many Thousands would range themselves under it What a Concourse would there be of Nobles and Patriots We should see Men of another Spirit than what has appeared among the Enemies to our Countrey  and such as would outshine the rebellious Part of their FellowSubjects as much in their Gallantry as in their Cause  I shall not so much suspect the Understandings of our Adversaries as to think it necessary to enforce these Considerations by putting them in Mind of that Fidelity and Allegiance which is so visible in His Majesty's Fleet and Army or of many other Particulars which in all humane Probability will perpetuate our present Form of Government and which may be suggested to them by their own private Thoughts  The Party indeed that is opposite to our present happy Settlement seem to be driven out of the Hopes of all human Methods for carrying on their Cause and are therefore reduced to the poor Comfort of Prodigies and old Women's Fables They begin to see Armies in the Clouds when all upon the Earth have forsaken them Nay I have been lately shewn a written Prophecy that is handed among them with great Secresy by which it appears their chief Reliance at present is upon a  Cheshire  Miller that was born with two Thumbs upon one hand  I have addressed this whole Paper to the Despair of our Malecontents not with a Design to aggravate the Pain of it but to use it as a Means of making them happy Let them seriously consider the Vexation and Disquietude of Mind that they are treasuring up for themselves by struggling with a Power which will be always too hard for them and by converting His Majesty's Reign into their own Misfortune which every impartial Man must look upon as the greatest Blessing to his Countrey Let them extinguish those Passions which can only imbitter their Lives to them and deprive  them of their Share in the Happiness of the Community They may conclude that His Majesty in Spite of any Opposition they can form against him will maintain his just Authority over them and whatever Uneasiness they may give themselves they can create none in him excepting only because they prevent him from exerting equally his natural Goodness and Benevolence to every Subject in his Dominions  No Friday March  Quid est Sapientiae semper idem velle atque idem nolle  Senec  IF we may believe the Observation which is made of us by Foreigners there is no Nation in  Europe  so much given to Change as the  English  There are some who ascribe this to the Fickleness of our Climate and Others to the Freedom of our Government From one or both of these Causes their Writers derive that Variety of Humours which appears among the People in general and that Inconsistency of Character which is to be found in almost every particular Person But as a Man should always be upon his Guard against the Vices to which he is most exposed so we should take a more than ordinary Care not to lie at the Mercy of the Weather in our moral Conduct nor to make a capricious Use of that Liberty which we enjoy by the Happiness of our Civil Constitution  This Instability of Temper ought in a particular Manner to be check'd when it shews itself in Political Affairs and disposes Men to wander from one Scheme of Government to another Since such a Fickleness of Behaviour in publick Measures cannot but be attended with very fatal Effects to our Countrey  In the first Place It hinders any great Undertaking which requires Length of Time for its Accomplishment from being brought to its due Perfection There is not any Instance in History which better confirms this Observation than that which is still fresh in every one's Memory We engaged in the late War with a Design to reduce an exorbitant Growth of Power in the most Dangerous Enemy to  GreatBritain  We gained a long and wonderful Series of Victories and had scarce any Thing left to do but to reap the Fruits of them When on a sudden our Patience failed us we grew tired of our Undertaking and received Terms from those who were upon the Point of giving us whatever we could have demanded of them  This Mutability of Mind in the  English  makes the ancient Friends of our Nation very backward to engage with us in such Alliances as are necessary for our mutual Defence and Security It is a common Notion among Foreigners that the  English  are good Confederates in an Enterprize which may be dispatched within a short Compass of Time but that they are not to be depended upon in a Work which cannot be finished without Constancy and Perseverance Our late Measures have so blemished the National Credit in this Particular that those Potentates who are entered into Treaties  with His present Majesty have been solely encouraged to it by their Confidence in His personal Firmness and Integrity  I need not after this suggest to my Reader the Ignominy and Reproach that falls upon a Nation which distinguishes it self among its Neighbours by such a wavering and unsettled Conduct  This our Inconsistency in the Pursuit of Schemes which have been thoroughly digested has as bad an Influence on our Domestick as on our Foreign Affairs We are told that the Famous Prince of  Conde  used to ask the  English  Embassador upon the Arrival of a Mail  Who was Secretary of State in  England  by that Post  as a Piece of Raillery upon the Fickleness of our Politicks But what has render'd this a Misfortune to our Countrey is that Publick Ministers have no sooner made themselves Masters of their Business than they have been dismissed from their Employments and that this Disgrace has befallen very many of them not because they have deserved it but because the People love to see new Faces in High Posts of Honour  It is a double Misfortune to a Nation which is thus given to Change when they have a Soveraign at the Head of them that is prone to fall in with all the Turns and Veerings of the People  Sallust  the Gravest of all the  Roman  Historians who had form'd his Notions of Regal Authority from the Manner in which he saw it exerted among the Barbarous Nations makes the following Remark  Plerumque Regiae Voluntates uti vehementes sic mobiles saepe ipsae sibi advorsae The Wills of Kings as they are generally vehement are likewise very fickle    and at different Times opposite to themselves  Were there any Colour for this general Observation how much does it redound to the Honour of such Princes who are Exceptions to it▪  The natural Consequence of an unsteady Government is the perpetuating of Strife and Faction among a divided People Whereas a King who persists in those Schemes which He has laid and has no other View in them but the Good of His Subjects extinguishes all Hopes of Advancement in those who would grow Great by an Opposition to His Measures and insensibly unites the Contending Parties in their Common Interest  Queen  Elizabeth  who makes the greatest Figure among our  English  Soveraigns was most eminently remarkable for that Steadiness and Uniformity which ran through all Her Actions during that long and Glorious Reign She kept up to Her chosen Motto in every Part of Her Life and never lost Sight of those Great Ends which She proposed to Herself on Her Accession to the Throne the Happiness of Her People and the strengthening of the Protestant Interest She often interposed Her Royal Authority to break the Cabals which were forming against her First Ministers who grew old and died in those Stations which they filled with so great Abilities By this Means she baffled the many Attempts of her foreign and domestick Enemies and entirely broke the whole Force and Spirit of that Party among her Subjects which was popishly affected and which wasnot a little Formidable in the Beginning of her Reign  The frequent Changes and Alterations in publick Proceedings the Multiplicity of Schemes introduced one upon another with the Variety of shortlived Favourites that prevailed in their several Turns under the Government of Her Successors have by Degrees broken us into those unhappy Distinctions and Parties which have given so much Uneasiness to our Kings and so often endangered the Safety of their People  I question not but every Impartial Reader hath been beforehand with me in considering on this Occasion the Happiness of our Countrey under the Government of his present Majesty who is so deservedly Famous for an inflexible Adherence to those Counsels which have a visible Tendency to the publick Good and to those Persons who heartily concur with Him in promoting these His generous Designs  A Prince of this Character will be dreaded by his Enemies and served with Courage and Zeal by his Friends and will either instruct us by his Example to fix the Unsteadiness of our Politicks or by his Conduct hinder it from doing us any Prejudice  Upon the Whole as there is no Temper of Mind more unmanly in a private Person nor more pernicious to the Publick in a Member of a Community than that Changeableness with which we are too justly branded by all our Neighbours it is to be hoped that the sound Part of the Nation will give no farther Occasion for this Reproach but continue steady to that happy Establishment which has now taken place among us And as Obstinacy in Prejudices which are detrimental to our Countrey ought not to be mistaken for that virtuous Resolution and Firmness of Mind which is necessary to our  Preservation it is to be wished that the Enemies to our Constitution would so far indulge themselves in this National Humour as to come into one Change more by falling in with that Plan of Government which at present they think fit to oppose At least we may expect they will be so wise as to shew a Legal Obedience to the best of Kings who profess the Duty of Passive Obedience to the Worst  No Monday March  Bella Viri pacemque gerant queis bella gerenda  Virg  WHen the  Athenians  had long contended against the Power of  Philip  he demanded of them to give up their Orators as well knowing their Opposition would be soon at an end if it were not irritated from Time to Time by these TongueWarriors I have endeavoured for the same Reason to gain our Female Adversaries and by that Means to disarm the Party of its principal Strength Let them give us up their Women and we know by Experience how inconsiderable a Resistance we are to expect from their Men  This sharp political Humour has but lately prevailed in so great a Measure as it now does among the beautiful Part of our Species They used to employ themselves wholly in the Scenes of a domestick Life and provided a Woman could keep her House in Order she never troubled herself about regulating the Commonwealth  The Eye of the Mistress was wont to make her Pewter shine and to inspect every Part of her Houshold Furniture as much as her Looking Glass But at present our discontented Matrons are so conversant in Matters of State that they wholly neglect their private Affairs for we may always observe that a Gossip in Politicks is a Slattern in her Family  It is indeed a melancholy Thing to see the Disorders of a Houshold that is under the Conduct of an angry Stateswoman who lays out all her Thoughts upon the Publick and is only attentive to find out Miscarriages in the Ministry Several Women of this Turn are so earnest in contending for Hereditary Right that they wholly neglect the Education of their own Sons and Heirs and are so taken up with their Zeal for the Church that they cannot find Time to teach their Children their Catechism A Lady who thus intrudes into the Province of the Men was so astonishing a Character among the old  Romans  that when  Amaesia  presented herself to speak before the Senate they looked upon it as a Prodigy and sent Messengers to inquire of the Oracle what it might portend to the Commonwealth  It would be manifestly to the Disadvantage of the  British  Cause should our pretty Loyalists profess an Indifference in StateAffairs while their disaffected Sisters are thus industrious to the Prejudice of their Countrey and accordingly we have the Satisfaction to find our SheAssociates are not idle upon this Occasion It is owing to the good Principles of these His Majesty's fair and faithful Subjects that our CountreyWomen appear no less amiable in the Eyes of the MaleWorld than they have done  in former Ages For where a great Number of Flowers grow the Ground at a Distance seems entirely cover'd with them and we must walk into it before we can distinguish the several Weeds that spring up in such a beautiful Mass of Colours Our great Concern is to find that Deformity can arise among so many Charms and that the most lovely Parts of the Creation can make themselves the most disagreeable But it is an Observation of the Philosophers that the best Things may be corrupted into the worst and the Ancients did not scruple to affirm that the Furies and the Graces were of the same Sex  As I should do the Nation and themselves good Service if I could draw the Ladies who still hold out against His Majesty into the Interest of our present Establishment I shall propose to their serious Consideration the several Inconveniencies which those among them undergo who have not yet surrender'd to the Government  They should first reflect on the great Sufferings and Persecutions to which they expose themselves by the Obstinacy of their Behaviour They lose their Elections in every Club where they are set up for Toasts They are obliged by their Principles to stick a Patch on the most unbecoming Side of their Foreheads They forego the Advantage of BirthDay Suits They are insulted by the Loyalty of Claps and Hisses every Time they appear at a Play They receive no Benefit from the Army and are never the better for all the young Fellows that wear Hats and Feathers They are forced to live in the Countrey and feed their Chicken at the same Time that they might shew themselves at  Court and appear in Brocade if they behaved themselves well In short what must go to the Heart of every fine Woman they throw themselves quite out of the Fashion  The abovemention'd Motive must have an Influence upon the gay Part of the Sex and as for those who are acted by more sublime and moral Principles they should consider that they cannot signalize themselves as Malecontents without breaking through all the amiable Instincts and softer Virtues which are peculiarly Ornamental to Womankind Their timorous gentle modest Behaviour their Affability Meekness GoodBreeding and many other beautiful Dispositions of Mind must be sacrificed to a blind and furious Zeal for they do not know what A Man is startled when he sees a pretty Bosom heaving with such PartyRage as is disagreeable even in that Sex which is of a more coarse and rugged Make And yet such is our Misfortune that we sometimes see a Pair of Stays ready to burst with Sedition and hear the most masculine Passions exprest in the sweetest Voices I have lately been told of a CountreyGentlewoman pretty much famed for this Virility of Behaviour in PartyDisputes who upon venting her Notions very freely in a strange Place was carry'd before an honest Justice of Peace This prudent Magistrate observing her to be a large black Woman and finding by her Discourse that she was no better than a Rebel in a RidingHood began to suspect her for my Lord  Nithisdale  till a Stranger came to her Rescue who assur'd him with Tears in his Eyes that he was her Husband  In the next Place our  British  Ladies may consider that by interesting themselves so zealously in the Affairs of the Publick they are engaged without any necessity in the Crimes which are often committed even by the Best of Parties and which they are naturally exempted from by the Privilege of their Sex The worst Character a Female could formerly arrive at was of being an ill Woman but by their present Conduct she may likewise deserve the Character of an ill Subject They come in for their Share of political Guilt and have found a Way to make themselves much greater Criminals than their Mothers before them  I have great Hopes that these Motives when they are assisted by their own Reflections will incline the Fair Ones of the adverse Party to come over to the National Interest in which their own is so highly concern'd especially if they consider that by these superfluous Employments which they take upon them as Partisans they do not only dip themselves in an unnecessary Guilt but are obnoxious to a Grief and Anguish of Mind which doth not properly fall within their Lot And here I would advise every one of these exasperated Ladies who indulges that opprobrious Eloquence which is so much in fashion to reflect on  Aesop  's Fable of the Viper  This little Animal  says the old Moralist  chancing to meet with a File began to lick it with her Tongue till the Blood came which gave her a very silly Satisfaction as imagining the Blood came from the File notwithstanding an the Smart was in her own Tongue  No Friday March  dii Visa secundant  Luc  IT is an old Observation that a Time of Peace is always a Time of Prodigies for as our NewsWriters must adorn their Papers with that which the Criticks call  The Marvellous  they are forced in a dead calm of Affairs to ransack every Element for proper Amusements and either to astonish their Readers from Time to Time with a strange and wonderful Sight or be content to lose their Custom The Sea is generally filled with Monsters when there are no Fleets upon it Mount  Aetna  immediately began to rage upon the Extinction of the Rebellion And woe to the People of  Catanea  if the Peace continues for they are sure to be shaken every Week with Earthquakes till they are relieved by the Siege of some other great Town in  Europe  The Air has likewise contributed its Quota of Prodigies We had a Blazing Star by the last Mail from  Genea  and in the present Dearth of Battels have been very opportunely entertained by Persons of undoubted Credit with a Civil War in the Clouds where our sharpsighted Malecontents discovered many Objects invisible to an Eye that is dim'd by  Whig  Principles  I question not but this Paper will fall in with the present Humour since it contains a very remarkable Vision of a  Highland  Seer who is famous among the Mountains and known by the Name of  SecondSightedSawney  Had he been  able to Write we might probably have seen this Vision sooner in Print for it happened to him very early in the late hard Winter and is transmitted to me by a Student of  Glasgow  who took the whole Relation from him and stuck close to the Facts though he has delivered them in his own Style  Sawney  was descended of an ancient Family very much renowned for their Skill in Prognosticks Most of his Ancestors were SecondSighted and his Mother but narrowly escaped being burnt for a Witch As he was going out one Morning very early to steal a Sheep he was seized on the sudden with a Fit of SecondSight The Face of the whole Countrey about him was changed in the Twinkling of an Eye and presented him with a wide Prospect of new Scenes and Objects which he had never seen till that Day  He discovered at a great Distance from him a large Fabrick which cast such a glistering Light about it that it looked like a huge Rock of Diamond Upon the Top of it was planted a Standard streaming in a strong Northern Wind and embroidered with a Mixture of Thisles and Flowerdeluces As he was amusing himself with this strange Sight he heard a  at some Distance behind him and turning about saw a General who seemed very much animated with the Sound of it marching towards him at the Head of a numerous Ar  He learnt upon Enquiry that they were  Procession to the Structure which stood  and which he found was the Tem  He immediately struck in with  described this March to the Temple  with so much Horrour that he shivered every Joynt all the while he spoke of it They were forced to clamber over so many Rocks and to tread upon the Brink of so many Precipices that they were very often in danger of their Lives  Sawney  declared that for his own Part he walked in fear of his Neck every Step he took Upon their coming within a few Furlongs of the Temple they passed through a very thick Grove consecrated to a Deity who was known by the Name of  Treason  They here dispersed themselves into abundance of Labyrinths and covered Walks which led to the Temple The Path was so very slippery the Shade so exceeding gloomy and the whole Wood so full of Ecchoes that they were forced to march with the greatest Wariness Circumspection and Silence They at length arrived at a great Gate which was the principal Avenue to that magnificent Fabrick  Sawney  stood some Time at the Entrance to observe the Splendour of the Building and was not a little entertained with a prodigious Number of Statues which were planted up and down in a spacious Court that lay before it but upon examining it more nicely he found the whole Fabrick which made such a glittering Appearance and seemed Impregnable was composed of Ice and that the several Statues which seemed at a distance to be made of the whitest Marble were nothing else but so many Figures in Snow The Front of the Temple  very curiously adorned with Stars and Garters▪ Ducal Coronets General's Staffs and many o…ther Emblems of Honour wrought in the  beautiful FrostWork After having stood at ga  some Time before this great Gate he discover+ed on it an Inscription signifying it to be  Gate of Perjury  There was erected near it a great Colossus in Snow that had two Faces and was drest like a  Jesuit  with one of its Hands upon a Book and the other grasping a Dagger Upon entring into the Court he took a particular Survey of several of the Figures There was Sedition with a Trumpet in her Hand and Rapine in the Garb of a Highlander Ambition Envy Disgrace Poverty and Disappointment were all of them represented under their proper Emblems Among other Statues he observed that of Rumour whispering an Ideot in the Ear who was the Representative of Credulity and Faction embracing with her hundred Arms an oldfashioned Figure in a SteepleCrown'd Hat that was design'd to express a cunning old Gipsy call'd PassiveObedience Zeal too had a Place among the rest with a Bandage over her Eyes tho' one would not have expected to have seen her represented in Snow But the most remarkable Object in this CourtYard was a huge Tree that grew up before the Porch of the Temple and was of the same kind with that which  Virgil  tells us flourished at the Entrance of the infernal Regions For it bore nothing but Dreams which hung in Clusters under every Leaf of it The Travellers refreshed themselves in the Shade of this Tree before they entered the  Temple of Rebellion  and after their Frights and Fatigues received great Comfort in the Fruit which fell from it At length the Gates of the Temple flew open and the Crowd rushed into it In the Centre of it was a grim Idol with a Sword in the Right Hand and a Firebrand in the Left The Forepart of the Pedestal was curiously embossed with a Triumph while the Backpart that  lay more out of Sight was filled with Gibbets and Axes This dreadful Idol is worshipped like several of old with human Sacrifices and his Votaries were consulting among themselves how to gratify him with Hecatombs when on a sudden they were surprized with the Alarm of a great Light which appeared in the Southern Part of the Heavens and made its Progress directly towards them This Light appeared as a great Mass of Flame or rather Glory like that of the Sun in its Strength There were three Figures in the midst of it who were known by their several Hieroglyphicks to be Religion Loyalty and Valour The last had a graceful Air a blooming Countenance and a Star upon its Breast which shot forth several pointed Beams of a peculiar Lustre The Glory which encompassed them covered the Place and darted its Rays with so much Strength that the whole Fabrick and all its Ornaments began to melt The several Emblems of Honour which were wrought on the Front in the brittle Materials abovementioned trickled away under the first Impressions of the Heat In short the Thaw was so violent that the Temple and Statues ran off in a sudden Torrent and the whole WinterPiece was dissolved The covered Walks were laid open by the Light which shone through every Part of them and the DreamTree withered like the famous Gourd that was smitten by the NoonDay Sun As for the Votaries they left the Place with the greatest Precipitation and dispersed themselves by Flight into a Thousand different Paths among the Mountains  No Monday March  Incendia lumen  Praebebant aliquisque malo fuit usus in illo  Ov Met  SIR  Francis Bacon  in the Dedication before his History of  Henry  the Seventh observes that peaceable Times are the best to live in though not so proper to furnish Materials for a Writer As hilly Countries afford the most entertaining Prospects though a Man would chuse to travel through a plain One To this we may add That the Times which are full of Disorders and Tumults are likewise the fullest of Instruction History indeed furnishes us with very distinct Accounts of Factions Conspiracies Civil Wars and Rebellions with the fatal Consequences that attend them But they do not make such deep and lasting Impressions on our Minds as Events of the same Nature to which we have our selves been Witnesses and in which we or our Friends and Acquaintance have been Sufferers As Adversity makes a Man Wise in his private Affairs civil Calamities give him Prudence and Circumspection in his publick Conduct  The Miseries of the Civil War under the Reign of King  Charles  the First and the Consequences which ensued upon them did for many Years deter the Inhabitants of our Island from the Thoughts of engaging anew in such desperate Undertakings and convinced them  by fatal Experience that nothing could be so pernicious to the  English  and so opposite to the Genius of the People as the Subversion of Monarchy In the like Manner we may hope that the great Expences brought upon the Nation by the present Rebellion the Sufferings of innocent People who have lived in that Place which was the Scene of it with that dreadful Prospect of Ruine and Confusion which must have followed its Success will secure us from the like Attempts for the future and fix His Majesty upon the Throne of  Great Britain  especially when those who are prompted to such wicked Practices reflect upon the Punishments to which the Criminals have exposed themselves and the Miseries in which they have involved their Relations Friends and Families  It will be likewise worth their while to consider how such Tumults and Riots as have been encouraged by many who we may hope did not propose to themselves such fatal Consequences lead to a Civil War and how naturally that seditious kind of Conversation which many seem to think consistent with their Religion and Morality ends in an open Rebellion I question not but the more virtuous and considerate Part of our Malecontents are now stung with a very just Remorse for this their Manner of Proceeding which has so visibly tended to the Destruction of their Friends and the Sufferings of their Countrey This may at the same Time prove an instructive Lesson to the Boldest and Bravest among the Dissaffected not to build any Hopes upon the talkative Zealots of their Party who have shewn by their whole Behaviour that their Hearts are equally filled with Treason and Cowardice An Army of Trumpeters  would give as great a Strength to a Cause as this Confederacy of TongueWarriours who like those military Musicians content themselves with animating their Friends to Battel and run out of the Engagement upon the first Onset  But one of the most useful Maxims we can learn from the present Rebellion is That nothing can be more contemptible and insignificant than the Scum of a People when they are instigated against a King who is supported by the Two Branches of the Legislature A Mob may pull down a Meeting House but will never be able to overturn a Government which has a courageous and wise Prince at the Head of it and one who is zealously assisted by the great Council of the Nation that best know the Value of him The Authority of the Lords and Commons of  Great Britain  in Conjunction with that of their Soveraign is not to be controul'd by a tumultuary Rabble It is big with Fleets and Armies can fortify itself with what Laws it shall judge proper for its own Defence can command the Wealth of the Kingdom for the Security of the People and engage the whole Protestant Interest of  Europe  in so good and just a Cause A disorderly Multitude contending with the Body of the Legislature is like a Man in a Fit under the Conduct of one in the Fullness of his Health and Strength Such a one is sure to be overruled in a little Time though he deals about his Blows and exerts himself in the most furious Convulsions while the Distemper is upon him  We may farther learn from the Course of the present Rebellion who among the foreign States in our Neighbourhood are the true and natural Friends of  Great Britain  if we observe  which of them gave us their Assistance in reducing our Countrey to a State of Peace and Tranquillity and which of them used their Endeavours to heighten our Confusions and plunge us into all the Evils of a Civil War I shall only take Notice under this Head that in former Ages it was the constant Policy of  France  to raise and cherish intestine Feuds and Discords in the Isle of  Great Britain  that we might either fall a Prey into their Hands or that they might prosecute their Designs upon the Continent with less Interruption Innumerable Instances of this Nature occur in History The most remarkable One was that in the Reign of King  Charles  the First Though that Prince was married to a Daughter of  France  and was personally beloved and esteemed in the  French  Court it is well known that they abetted both Parties in the Civil War and always furnished Supplies to the weaker Side lest there should be an End put to those fatal Divisions  We might also observe that this Rebellion has been a Means of discovering to His Majesty how much he may depend upon the Professions and Principles of the several Parties among his own Subjects who are those Persons that have espoused his Interests with Zeal or Indifference and who among them are influenced to their Allegiance by Places Duty or Affection But as these and several other Considerations are obvious to the Thoughts of every Reader I shall conclude with observing how naturally many of those who distinguish themselves by the Name of the  HighChurch  unite themselves to the Cause of  Popery  since it is manifest that all the Protestants concerned  in the Rebellion were such as gloried in this Distinction  It would be very unjust to charge all who have ranged themselves under this new Denomination as if they had done it with a Design to favour the Interests of Popery But it is certain that many of them who at their first setting out were most averse to the Doctrines of the Church of  Rome  have by the Cunning of our Adversaries been inspired with such an unreasonable Aversion to their Protestant Brethren and taught to think so favourably of the  RomanCatholick  Principles not to mention the Endeavours that have been used to reconcile the Doctrines of the Two Churches which are in themselves as opposite as Light and Darkness that they have been drawn over insensibly into its Interests It is no wonder therefore that so many of these deluded Zealots have been engaged in a Cause which they at first abhorr'd and have wished or acted for the Success of an Enterprize that might have ended in the Extirpation of the Protestant Religion in this Kingdom and in all  Europe  In short they are like the  Syrians  who were first smitten with Blindness and unknowingly led out of their Way into the Capital of their Enemy's Countrey insomuch that the Text tells us  When they opened their Eyes they found themselves in the midst of  Samaria  No Friday March  Dis te minorem quod geris imperas  Hinc omne principium huc refer exitum  Dii multa neglecti dederunt  Hesperiae mala luctuosae  Hor  THis being a Day in which the Thoughts of our Countreymen are or ought to be employed on serious Subjects I shall take the Opportunity of that Disposition of Mind in my Readers to recommend to them the Practice of those Religious and Moral Virtues without which all Policy is vain and the best Cause deprived of its greatest Ornament and Support  Common Sense as well as the Experience of all Ages teaches us that no Government can flourish which doth not encourage and propagate Religion and Morality among all its particular Members It was an Observation of the ancient  Romans  that their Empire had not more increased by the Strength of their Arms than by the Sanctity of their Manners And  Cicero  who seems to have been better versed than any of them both in the Theory and the Practice of Politicks makes it a Doubt whether it were possible for a Community to exist that had not a prevailing Mixture of Piety in its Constitution Justice Temperance Humility and almost every other Moral Virtue do not only derive the Blessings of Providence upon those who exercise them but are the natural Means for acquiring the publick Prosperity Besides Religious  Motives and Instincts are so busy in the Heart of every reasonable Creature that a Man who would hope to govern a Society without any regard to these Principles is as much to be contemned for his Folly as to be detested for his Impiety  To this we may add that the World is never sunk into such a State of Degeneracy but they pay a natural Veneration to Men of Virtue and rejoyce to see themselves conducted by those who act under the Awe of a supreme Being and who think themselves accountable for all their Proceedings to the great Judge and Superintendent of human Affairs  Those of our FellowSubjects who are sensible of the Happiness they enjoy in His Majesty's Accession to the Throne are obliged by all the Duties of Gratitude to adore that Providence which has so signally interposed in our Behalf by clearing a Way to the Protestant Succession through such Difficulties as seemed insuperable by detecting the Conspiracies which have been formed against it and by many wonderful Events weakening the Hands and baffling the Attempts of all His Majesty's Enemies both foreign and domestick  The Party who distinguish themselves by their Zeal for the present Establishment should be careful in a particular Manner to discover in their whole Conduct such a Reverence for Religion as may shew how groundless that Reproach is which is cast upon them by their Enemies of being averse to our national Worship While others engross to themselves the Name of  The Church  and in a Manner excommunicate the best Part of their FellowSubjects let us shew our selves the genuine Sons  of it by practising the Doctrines which it teach+es The Advantage will be visibly on our Side▪ if we stick to its Essentials while they triumph in that empty Denomination which they bestow upon themselves Too many of them are already dipt in the Guilt of Perjury and Sedition▪ and as we remain unblemished in these Particulars let us endeavour to excel them in all the other Parts of Religion and we shall quickly find that a regular Morality is in its own Nature more popular as well as more meritorious than an intemperate Zeal  We have likewise in the present Times of Confusion and Disorder an Opportunity of shewing our Abhorrence of several Principles which have been ascribed to us by the Malice of our Enemies A Disaffection to Kings and Kingly Government with a Proneness to Rebellion have been often very unjustly charged on that Party which goes by the Name of  Whigs  Our steady and continued Adherence to His Majesty and the present happy Settlement will the most effectually confute this Calumny Our Adversaries who know very well how odious Commonwealth Principles are to the  English  Nation have inverted the very Sense of Words and Things rather than not continue to brand us with this imaginary Guilt For with some of these Men at present Loyalty to our King is Republicanism and Rebellion PassiveObedience  It has been an old Objection to the Principles of the  Whigs  that several of their Leaders who have been zealous for redressing the Grievances of Government have not behaved themselves better than the  Tories  in domestick Scenes of Life But at the same time have been publick  Patriots and private Oppressors This Objection were it true has no Weight in it since the Misbehaviour of particular Persons does not at all affect their Cause and since a Man may act laudably in some Respects who does not so in others However it were to be wished that Men would not give occasion even to such Invectives but at the same time they consult the Happiness of the Whole that they would promote it to their utmost in all their private Dealings among those who lie more immediately within their Influence In the mean while I must observe that this Reproach which may be often met with both in Print and Conversation tends in reality to the Honour of the  Whigs  as it supposes that a greater Regard to Justice and Humanity is to be expected from them than from those of the opposite Party And it is certain we cannot better recommend our Principles than by such Actions as are their natural and genuine Fruits  Were we thus careful to guard our selves in a particular Manner against these groundless Imputations of our Enemies and to rise above them as much in our Morality as in our Politicks our Cause would be always as flourishing as it is just It is certain that our Notions have a more natural Tendency to such a Practice as we espouse the Protestant Interest in Opposition to that of Popery which is so far from advancing Morality by its Doctrines that it has weakned or entirely subverted many of the Duties even of Natural Religion  I shall conclude with recommending one Virtue more to the Friends of the present Establishment wherein the  Whigs  have been remarkably deficient which is a general Unanimity and  Concurrence in the Pursuit of such Measures as are necessary for the wellbeing of their Countrey As it is a laudable Freedom of Thought which unshackles their Minds from the poor and narrow Prejudices of Education and opens their Eyes to a more extensive View of the publick Good the same Freedom of Thought disposes several of them to the embracing of particular Schemes and Maxims and to a certain Singularity of Opinion which proves highly prejudicial to their Cause especially when they are encouraged in them by a vain Breath of Popularity or by the artificial Praises which are bestowed on them by the opposite Party This Temper of Mind though the Effect of a noble Principle very often betrays their Friends and brings into Power the most pernicious and implacable of their Enemies In Cases of this Nature it is the Duty of an honest and prudent Man to sacrifice a doubtful Opinion to the concurring Judgment of those whom he believes to be well intentioned to their Countrey and who have better Opportunities of looking into all its most complicated Interests An honest Party of Men acting with Unanimity are of infinitely greater Consequence than the same Party aiming at the same End by different Views As a large Diamond is of a thousand Times greater Value whilst it remains entire than when it is cut into a Multitude of smaller Stones notwithstanding they may each of them be very curiously set and are all of the same Water  No Monday April  I verbis virtutem illude superbis  Virg  AS I was some Years ago engaged in Conversation with a Fashionable French  Abbé  upon a Subject which the People of that Kingdom love to start in Discourse the comparative Greatness of the two Nations he asked me  How many Souls I thought there might be in  London I replied being willing to do my Countrey all the Honour I fairly could That there were several who computed them at near a Million But not finding that Surprize I expected in his Countenance I returned the Question upon him How many he thought there might be in  Paris  To which he answered with a certain Grimace of Coldness and Indifference  About ten or twelve Millions  It would indeed be incredible to a Man who has never been in  France  should one relate the extravagant Notion they entertain of themselves and the mean Opinion they have of their Neighbours There are certainly notwithstanding the visible Decay of Learning and Taste which has appear'd among them of late Years many particular Persons in that Countrey who are eminent in the highest Degree for their Good Sense as well as for their Knowledge in all the Arts and Sciences But I believe every one who is acquainted with them will allow that the People in general fall far short of those who border upon them in Strength and Solidity of Understanding  One would therefore no more wonder to see the most shallow Nation of  Europe  the most Vain than to find the most empty Fellows in every distinct Nation more conceited and censorious than the rest of their Countreymen Prejudice and SelfSufficiency naturally proceed from Inexperience of the World and Ignorance of Mankind As it requires but very small Abilities to discover the Imperfections of another we find that none are more apt to turn their Neighbours into Ridicule than those who are the most Ridiculous in their own private Conduct  Those among the  French  who have seen nothing but their own Countrey can scarce bring themselves to believe that a Nation which lies never so little North of them is not full of  Goths  and  Vandals  Nay those among them who travel into foreign Parts are so prejudiced in favour of their own imaginary Politeness that they are apt to look upon every thing as barbarous in Proportion as it deviates from what they find at Home No less a Man than an Ambassador of  France  being in Conversation with our King of glorious Memory and willing to encourage his Majesty told him that he talked like a  Frenchman  The King smiled at the Encomium which was given him and only reply'd  Sir I am sure you do  An eminent Writer of the last Age was so offended at this Kind of Insolence which shewed itself very plentifully in one of their Travellers who gave an Account of  England  that he vindicated the Honour of his Countrey in a Book full of just Satyr and Ingenuity I need not acquaint my Reader that I mean Bishop  Sprat  's Answer to  Sorbiere  Since I am upon this Head I cannot forbear mentioning some profound Remarks that I have been lately shewn in a  French  Book the Author of which lived it seems some Time in  England The  English says this curious Traveller  very much delight in  Pudding  This is the favourite Dish not only of the Clergy but of the People in general Provided there be a  Pudding  upon the Table no matter what are the other Dishes they are sure to make a Feast They think themselves so happy when they have a  Pudding  before them that if any one would tell a Friend he is arrived in a lucky Juncture the ordinary Salutation is Sir I am glad to see you you are come in  PuddingTime  One cannot have the Heart to be angry at this judicious Observer notwithstanding he has treated us like a Race of  Hottentots  because he only taxes us with our inordinate Love of Pudding which it must be confess'd is not so elegant a Dish as Frog and Sallat Every one who has been at  Paris  knows that  Un gros Milord Anglois  is a frequent Jest upon the  French  Stage as if Corpulence was a proper Subject for Satyr or a Man of Honour could help his being Fat who Eats suitable to his Quality  It would be endless to recount the Invectives which are to be met with among the  French  Historians and even in  Mezeray  himself against the Manners of our Countreymen Their Authors in other Kinds of Writing are likewise very liberal in Characters of the same Nature I cannot forbear mentioning the learned Monsieur  Patin  in particular who tells us in so many Words  That the  English  are a People whom he naturally abhors  And in another place  That he looks upon the  English  among the several Nations  of Men as he does upon Wolves among the several Species of Beasts  A  British  Writer would be very justly charged with want of Politeness who in return to this Civility should look upon the  French  as that Part of Mankind which answers to a Species in the Brute Creation whom we call in  English  by the Name of Monkies  If the  French  load us with these Indignities we may observe for our Comfort that they give the rest of their Borderers no better Quarter If we are a dull heavy phlegmatick People we are it seems no worse than our Neighbours As an Instance I shall set down at large a remarkable Passage in a famous Book intituled  Chevraeana  written many Years ago by the celebrated Monsieur  Chevreau  after having advertised my Reader that the Dutchess of  Hanover  and the Princess  Elizabeth  of  Bohemia  who are mentioned in it were the late excellent Princess  Sophia  and her Sister  Tilenus pour un Allemand parle ecrit bien François  dit Scaliger  Gretzer a bien de l'esprit pour un Allemand  dit le Cardinal du Perron Et le P Bouhours met en question  Si un Allemand peut être bel esprit  On ne doit juger ni bien ni mal d'une Nation par un particulier ni d'un particulier par sa Nation Il y a des Allemands comme des François qui n'ont point d'esprit des Allemands qui ont scû plus d' Hebreu plus de Grec que Scaliger le Cardinal du Perron J'honore fort le P Bouhours qui a du merite mais J'ose dire que la France n'a point de plus bel Esprit que  Madame la Duchesse de Hanovre d'aujourdhui  ni de personne plus solidement savante en Philosophie que l'etoit  Madame la Princesse Elizabeth de Boheme sa Soeur  Et je ne croi pas que 'on  refuse le même titre à beaucoup d'Academiciens d'Allemagne dont les Ouvrages meriteroient bien d'être traduits Il y a d'autres Princesses en Allemagne qui ont infiniment de l'esprit Les François disent  ce'st un Allemand  pour exprimer un homme pesant brutal les Allemands comme les Italiens  c'est un François  pour dire un fou un etourdi C'est aller trop loin comme le Prince de  Salé  dit de  Ruyter Il est honnête homme c'est bien dommage qu'il soit Chrétien  Chevraeana    Tom  I  '  Tilenus  says  Scaliger  speaks and writes well for a  German Gretzer  has a great deal of Wit for a  German  says Cardinal  Perron  And Father  Bouhours  makes it a Question Whether a  German  can be a Wit One ought not to judge well or ill of a Nation from a particular Person nor of a particular Person from his Nation There are  Germans  as there are  French  who have no Wit and  Germans  who are better skilled in  Greek  and  Hebrew  than either  Scaliger  or the Cardinal  du Perron  I have a great Honour for Father  Bouhours  who is a Man of Merit but will be bold to say that there is not in all  France  a Person of more Wit than the present Dutchess of  Hanover  nor more thoroughly knowing in Philosophy than was the late Princess  Elizabeth  of  Bohemia  her Sister and I believe none can refuse the same Title to many Academicians in  Germany  whose Works very well deserve to be translated into our Tongue There are other Princesses in  Germany  who have also an infinite deal of Wit The  French  say of a Man that he is a  German  when they would signify that he is dull and heavy and the  Germans  as well as the  Italians  when they would call a  Man a Hairbrain'd Coxcomb say he is a  French  Man This is going too far and is like the Governour of  Sally  's Saying of  De Ruyter  the  Dutch  Admiral  He's an honest Man 'tis great Pity he is a Christian  '  Having already run my Paper out to its usual Length I have not room for many Reflections on that which is the Subject of it The last cited Author has been before hand with me in its proper Moral I shall only add to it that there has been an unaccountable Disposition among the  English  of late Years to fetch the Fashion from the  French  not only in their Dress and Behaviour but even in their Judgments and Opinions of Mankind It will however be reasonable for us if we concur with them in their Contempt of other neighbouring Nations that we should likewise regard our selves under the same View in which they are wont to place us The Representations they make of us are as of a Nation the least favoured by them and as these are agreeable to the natural Aversion they have for us are more disadvantageous than the Pictures they have drawn of any other People in  Europe  No Friday April  Omnes homines P C qui de rehus dubiis consultant ab  amicitia ira atque misericordia vacuos esse decet  Caesar ap Sallust  I Have purposely avoided during the whole Course of this Paper to speak any thing concerning  the Treatment which is due to such Persons as have been concerned in the late Rebellion because I would not seem to irritate Justice against those who are under the Prosecution of the Law nor incense any of my Readers against unhappy though guilty Men But when we find the Proceedings of our Government in this Particular traduced and misrepresented it is the Duty of every good Subject to set them in their proper Light  I am the more prompted to this Undertaking by a Pamphlet entituled  An Argument to prove the Affections of the People of  England  to be the best Security of the Government humbly offer'd to the Consideration of the Patrons of Severity and apply'd to the present Juncture of Affairs  Had the whole Scope of the Author been answerable to his Title he would have only undertaken to prove what every Man in his Wits is already convinced of But the Drift of the Pamphlet is to stir up our Compassion towards the Rebels and our Indignation against the Government The Author who knew that such a Design as this could not be carried on without a great deal of Artifice and Sophistry has puzzled and perplex'd his Cause by throwing his Thoughts together in such a study'd Confusion that upon this Account if upon any his Pamphlet is as the Party have represented it Unanswerable  The famous Monsieur  Bayle  compares the answering of an immethodical Author to the Hunting of a Duck When you have him full in your Sight and fancy your self within reach  he gives you the Slip and becomes in  ble His Argument is lost in such a Varie  of Matter that you must catch it where you  as it rises and disappears in the several  of his Discourse  The Writer of this Pamphlet could doubt+less have ranged his Thoughts in much bette  Order if he had pleased But he knew very well that Error is not to be advanced by Per+spicuity In order therefore to answer this Pamphlet I must reduce the Substance of it under proper Heads and disembroil the Thoughts of the Author since he did not think fit to do it himself  In the first Place I shall observe that the Terms which the Author makes use of are loose general and undefined as will be shewn in the Sequel of this Paper and what less becomes a fair Reasoner he puts wrong and invidious Names on every thing to colour a false Way of Arguing He allows that  the Rebels indisputably merit to be severely Chastised  that they  deserve it according to Law  and that  if they are punished they have none to thank but themselves  p How can a Man after such a Concession make use sometimes of the Word  Cruelty  but generally of  Revenge  when he pleads against the Exercise of what according to his own Notion is at the most but rigid Justice Or why are such Executions which according to his own Opinion are legal so often to be called  Violences  and  Slaughter  Not to mention the Appellations given to those who do not agree with him in his Opinion for Clemency as the  Bloodthirsty  the  Political Butchers    State Chirugeons  and the like  But I shall now speak of that Point which is the great and reigning Fallacy of the Pamphlet and runs more or less through every Paragraph His whole Argument turns upon this single Consideration Whether the King should exert Mercy or Justice towards those who have openly  appeared in the present Rebellion By Mercy he means a general Pardon by Justice a general Punishment So that he supposes no other Method practicable in this Juncture than either the Forgiving All or the Executing All Thus he puts the Question  Whether it be the Interest of the Prince to destroy the Rebels by Fire Sword or Gibbet  p And speaking of the  Zealots for the Government  he tells us  They think no Remedy so good as to make clear Work and that they declare for the utter Extirpation of All who are its Enemies in the most minute Circumstance As if Amputation were the sole Remedy these political Butchers cou'd find out for the Distempers of a State or that they thought the only Way to make the Top flourish were to lop off the Under Branches  p He then speaks of the  Coffeehouse Polititians and the Casuists in RedCoats Who  he tells us  are for the utmost Rigour that their Laws of War or Laws of Convenience can inspire them with  p Again  It is represented  says he  that the Rebels deserve the highest Punishment the Laws can inflict  p And afterwards tells us  The Question is Whether the Government shall shew Mercy or take a Reverend Divine's Advice to slay Man and Woman Insant and Suckling  p Thus again he tells us  The Friends to severe Counsels alledge that the Government ought not to be moved by compassion  and that  the Law should have its Course  p And in another Place puts these Words in their Mouths  He may still retain their Affection and yet let the Laws have their Course in punishing the Guilty  p He goes upon the same Supposition in the following Passages  It is impracticable in so general a Corruption to destroy  All  who are infected and unless you destroy  All  you do nothing to the purpose  p  Shall our  Rightful King shew himself less the true Father of his People and afford his Pardon to  None  of those People who like King  Lear  to his Daughters had so great a Confidence in his Virtue as to give him All  p I shall only add that the concluding Paragraph which is worked up with so much artificial Horrour goes upon a Supposition answerable to the whole Tenor of the Pamphlet and implies that  the Impeach'd Lords  were to be Executed without Exception or Discrimination  Thus we see what is the Author's Idea of that Justice against which all his Arguments are levell'd If in the next Place we consider the Nature of that Clemency which he recommends we find it to be no less universal and unrestrain'd  He declares for a  General Act of Indemnity  p and tells us  It is the Sense of every dispassionate Man of the Kingdom that the Rebels may and ought to be Pardoned  p  One popular Act  says he  wou'd even yet retrieve all  p He declares himself not  overfond of the Doctrines of making Examples of Traitors  ibid And that  the Way to prevent Things from being brought to an Extremity is to deal mildly with those unfortunate Gentlemen engaged in the Rebellion  The Reader may now see in how fallacious a Manner this Writer has stated the Controversy He supposes there are but two Methods of treating the Rebels that is by cutting oft every one of them to a Man or pardoning every one of them without Distinction Now it there be a third Method between these two Extremes which is on all Accounts more eligible than either of them it is certain that the whole Course of his Argumentation comes to nothing  Every Man of the plainest Understanding will easily conclude that in the Case before us as in most others we ought to avoid both Extremes that to destroy every Rebel would be an excessive Severity and to forgive every one of them an unreasonable Weakness The proper Method of Proceeding is that which the Author has purposely omitted Namely to temper Justice with Mercy and according to the different Circumstances that aggravate or alleviate the Guilt of the Offenders to restrain the Force of the Laws or to let them take their proper Course Punishments are necessary to shew there is Justice in a Government and Pardons to shew there is Mercy and both together convince the People that our Constitution under a good Administration does not only make a Difference between the Guilty and the Innocent but even among the Guilty between such as are more or less criminal  This middle Method which has been always practised by wise and good Governors has hitherto been made use of by our Soveraign If indeed a Stranger and one who is altogether unacquainted with His Majesty's Conduct should read this Pamphlet he would conclude that every Person engaged in the Rebellion was to die  by the Sword the Halter or the Axe  nay that their Friends and Abettors were involved in the same Fate Would it be possible for him to imagine that of the several Thousands openly taken in Arms and liable to Death by the Laws of their Countrey not above Forty have yet suffered How would he be surpriz'd to hear that notwithstanding His Majesty's Troops have been Victorious in every Engagement more of His Friends have lost their Lives in  this Rebellion than of His traiterous Subjects though we add to those who have dy'd by the Hand of Justice those of them who fell in Battel And yet we find a more popular Compassion endeavoured to be raised for the Deaths of the Guilty who have brought such Calamities on their Countrey than for the Innocent who perished in the Defence of it  This middle Method of Proceeding which has been pursued by His Majesty and is wilfully overlooked by the Author best answers the Ends of Government which is to maintain the Safety of the Publick by Rewards and Punishments It is also incumbent on a Governor according to the received Dictates of Religion Which instructs us  That he beareth not the Sword in vain but ought to be a Terror to Evildoors and a Praise to them that do Well  It is likewise in a particular manner the Duty of a  British  King who obliges himself by his CoronationOath to execute  Justice in Mercy  that is to mix them in his Administration and not to exercise either of them to the total Exclusion of the other  But if we consider the Arguments which this Author gives for Clemency from the good Effects it would produce we shall find that they hold true only when apply'd to such a Mercy as serves rather to mitigate than exclude Justice The Excellence of that unlimited Clemency which the Author contends for is recommended by the following Arguments  First  That it endears a Prince to his People This he descants on in several Parts of his Book  Clemency will endear his Person to the Nation and then they will neither have the Power nor Wi  to disturb him  p  Was there ever a cruel  Prince that was not hated by his Subjects  p  A mercifull goodnatur'd Disposition is of all others the most amiable Quality and in Princes always attended with a popular Love  p  It is certain that such a popular Love will always rise towards a Good Prince who exercises such a Mercy as I have before described which is consistent with the Safety of the Constitution and the Good of his Kingdom But if it be thrown away at random it loses its Virtue lessens the Esteem and Authority of a Prince and cannot long recommend him even to the weakest of his Subjects who will find all the Effects of Cruelty in such an illgrounded Compassion It was a famous Saying of  William Rufus  and is quoted to his Honour by Historians "Whosoever spares perjured Men Robbers Plunderers and Traitors deprives all good Men of their Peace and Quietness and lays a Foundation of innumerable Mischiefs to the Virtuous and Innocent"  Another Argument for unlimited Clemency is that it shews a couragious Temper  Clemency is likewise an Argument of Fearlessness whereas Cruelty not only betrays a weak abject depraved Spirit but also is for the most part a certain Sign of Cowardice  p  He had a truly great Soul and such will always disdain the Coward's Virtue which is Fear and the Consequence of it which is Revenge  p This Panegyrick on Clemency when it is governed by Reason is likewise very right but it may so happen that the putting of Laws in Execution against Traitors to their Countrey may be the Argument of Fearlessness when our Governors are told that they dare not do it and such Methods may be made use of to extort Pardons as would make it look  like Cowardice to grant them In this last Case the Author should have remembred his own Words that  then only Mercy is meritorious when it is voluntary and not extorted by the Necessity of Affairs  p Besides the Author should have considered that another Argument which he makes use of for his Clemency are the Resentments that may arise from the Execution of a Rebel An Argument adapted to a cowardly not a fearless Temper This he infers from the Disposition of  the Friends Wellwishers or Associates of the Sufferers  p  Resentment will inflame some in others Compassion will by degrees rise into Resentment This will naturally beget a Disposition to overturn what they dislike and then there will want only a fair Opportunity  p This Argument like most of the others pleads equally for Malefactors of all kinds whom the Government can never bring to Justice without disobliging their Friends Wellwishers or Associates But I believe if the Author would Converse with any Friend Wellwisher or Associate of these Sufferers he would find them rather deterr'd from their Practices by their Sufferings than disposed to rise in a new Rebellion to revenge them A Government must be in a very weak and melancholy Condition that is not armed with a sufficient Power for its own Defence against the Resentment of its Enemies and is afraid of being overturn'd if it does Justice on those who attempt it But I am afraid the main Reason why these Friends Wellwishers and Associates are against Punishing any of the Rebels is that which must be an Argument with every wise Governor for doing Justice upon some of them namely that it is a likely Means to come at the Bottom of this  Conspiracy and to detect those who have been the private Abettors of it and who are still at work in the same Design if we give Credit to the Suggestions of our Malecontents themselves who labour to make us believe that there is still Life in this wicked Project  I am wonderfully surprized to see another Argument made use of for a general Pardon which might have been urged more properly for a general Execution The Words are these  The Generality will never be brought to believe but that those who suffer only for Treason have very hard Measure nor can you with all your Severity undeceive them of their Error  If the Generality of the  English  have such a favourable Opinion of Treason nothing can cure them of an Error so fatal to their Countrey as the Punishment of those who are guilty of it It is evident that a General Impunity would confirm them in such an Opinion For the Vulgar will never be brought to believe that there is a Crime where they see no Penalty As it is certain no Error can be more destructive to the very Being of Government than this a proper Remedy ought to be applied to it And I would ask this Author Whether upon this Occasion  The Doctrine of making Examples of Traitors  be not very seasonable though he declares himself  not overfond of it  The way to awaken Men's Minds to the Sense of this Guilt is to let them see by the Sufferings of some who have incurr'd it how hainous a Crime it is in the Eye of the Law  The foregoing Answer may be apply'd likewise to another Argument of the same Nature  If the Faction be as numerous as is pretended if the Spirit has spread itself over the whole Kingdom if it has mixed with the Mass of the People then  certainly all bloody Measures will but whet Men the more for Revenge  If Justice inflicted on a few of the most flagrant Criminals with Mercy extended to the Multitude may be called  bloody Measures  they are without doubt absolutely necessary in case the Spirit of Faction be thus spread among the Mass of the People who will readily conclude that if open Rebellion goes unpunished every Degree of Faction which leads to it must be altogether innocent  I am come now to another Argument for Pardoning all the Rebels which is that it would inspire them all with Gratitude and reduce them to their Allegiance  It is truly Heroick to overcome the Hearts of one's Enemies and when it is compassed the Undertaking is truly Politick  p  He has now a fair Opportunity of Conquering more Enemies by one Act of Clemency than the most successful General will be able to do in many Campaigne  p  Are there not infinite Numbers who would become most Dutiful upon any fair Invitation upon the least Appearance of Grace  p  Which of the Rebels could be ungrateful enough to resist or abuse Goodness exemplified in Practice as well as extoll'd in Theory  p Has not His Majesty then shewn the least Appearance of Grace in that generous Forgiveness which he has already extended to such great Numbers of his Rebellious Subjects who must have died by the Laws of their Countrey had not his Mercy interpos'd in their Behalf But if the Author means as he doth thro' this whole Pamphlet by the like Expressions an universal Forgiveness no unprejudiced Man can be of his Opinion that it wou'd have had this good Effect We may see how little the Conversion of Rebels is to be depended on when we observe that several of the  Leaders in this Rebellion were Men who had been pardoned for Practices of the same Nature And that most of those who have suffered have avowed their Perseverance in their Rebellious Principles when they spoke their Minds at the Place of Execution notwithstanding their Professions to the contrary while they solicited Forgiveness Besides were Pardon extended indifferently to All which of them would think himself under any particular Obligation Whereas by that prudent Discrimination which His Majesty has made between the Offenders of different Degrees He naturally obliges those whom he has considered with so much Tenderness and distinguished as the most proper Objects of Mercy In short those who are pardoned would not have known the Value of Grace if none had felt the Effects of Justice  I must not omit another Reason which the Author makes use of against Punishments  Because  he says  those very Means or the Apprehensions of them have brought Things to the pass in which they are and consequently will reduce them from bad to worse  p And afterwards  This Growth of Dissaffection is in a great Measure owing to the groundless Jealousies Men entertain'd of the present Administration as if they were to expect nothing but Cruelty under it  If our Author would have spoken out and have applied these Effects to the real Cause he could ascribe this Change of Affections among the People to nothing else but the Change of the Ministry For we find that a great many Persons lost their Loyalty with their Places and that their Friends have ever since made use of the most base Methods to infuse those groundless Discontents into the Minds of the Common People which  have brought so many of them to the Brink of Destruction and proved so detrimental to their FellowSubjects However this Proceeding has shewn how dangerous it would have been for His Majesty to have continued in their Places of Trust a Set of Men some of whom have since actually joined with the Pretender to His Crown While others may be justly suspected never to have been faithfull to Him in their Hearts or at least whose Principles are precarious and visibly conducted by their Interest In a Word if the Removal of these Persons from their Posts has produced such popular Commotions the Continuance of them might have produced something much more fatal to their King and Countrey and have brought about that Revolution which has now been in vain attempted The Condition of a  British  King would be very poor indeed should a Party of his Subjects threaten Him with a Rebellion upon his bringing Malefactors to Justice or upon his refusing to employ those whom he dares not trust  I shall only mention another Argument against the Punishment of any of the Rebels whose Executions he represents as very shocking to the People because they are their  Countreymen  p And again  The Quality of the Sufferers their Alliances their Characters their being  Englishmen  with a thousand other Circumstances will contribute to breed more ill Blood than all the StateChirurgeons can possibly let out  p The Impeached Lords likewise in the last Paragraph of the Pamphlet are recommended to our Pity because they are our  Countreymen  By this way of Reasoning no Man that is a Gentleman or born within the three Seas should be subject  to Capital Punishment Besides who can be guilty of Rebellion that are not our  Countreymen  As for the endearing Name of  Englishman  which he bestows upon every one of the Criminals he should consider that a Man deservedly cuts himself off from the Affections as well as the Privileges of that Community which he endeavours to subvert  These are the several Arguments which appear in different Forms and Expressions thro' this whole Pamphlet and under which every one that is urged in it may be reduced There is indeed another Set of them derived from the Example and Authority of Great Persons which the Author produces in Favour of his own Scheme These are  William  the Conqueror  Henry  IV  th  of  France  our late King  William  King  Solomon  and the  Pretender  If a Man were disposed to draw Arguments for Severity out of History how many Instances might one find of it among the greatest Princes of every Nation But as different Princes may act very laudably by different Methods in different Conjunctures I cannot think this a conclusive Way of Reasoning However let us examine this Set of Arguments and we shall find them no less defective than those abovementioned  One of the greatest of our  English  Monarchs  says our Author  was  William the Conqueror  and he was the greater because he put to Death only one Person of Quality that we read of and him after repeated Treacheries yet he was a Foreigner had Power sufficient and did not want Provocations to have been more bloody  p This Person of Quality was the Earl  Waltheof  who being overtaken with Wine engaged in a Conspiracy against this Monarch but repenting of it the  next Morning repaired to the King who was then in  Normandy  and discovered the whole Matter Notwithstanding which he was beheaded upon the Defeat of the Conspiracy for having but thus far tampered in it And as for the rest of the Conspirators who rose in an actual Rebellion the King used them with the utmost Rigour he cut off the Hands of some put out the Eyes of others some were hanged upon Gibbets and those who fared the best were sent into Banishment There are indeed the most dreadful Examples of Severity in this Reign Tho' it must be confess'd that after the Manner of those Times the Nobility generally escaped with their Lives tho' Multitudes of them were punished with Banishment perpetual Imprisonment Forfeitures and other great Severities While the poor People who had been deluded by these their Ringleaders were executed with the utmost Rigour A Partiality which I believe no Commoner of  England  will ever think to be either just or reasonable  The next Instance is  Henry  the IV  th  of  France    who  says our Author  so handsomely expressed his Tenderness for his People when at signing the Treaty of  Vervins  he said That by one Dash of his Pen he had overcome more Enemies than he cou'd ever be able to do with his Sword  Would not an ordinary Reader think that this Treaty of  Vervins  was a Treaty between  Henry  the IV  th  and a Party of his Subjects For otherwise how can it have a Place in the present Argument But instead of that it was a Treaty between  France  and  Spain  so that the Speech expressed an equal Tenderness to the  Spaniards  and  French  as Multitudes of either Nation must have fallen in that War had it continued longer As for this King's Treatment of Conspirators tho' he is quoted  thrice in the Pamphlet as an Example of Clemency you have an eminent Instance of it in his Behaviour to the Mareschal  de Biron  who had been his old faithful Servant and had contributed more than any one to his Advancement to the Throne This Mareschal upon some Discontent was enter'd into a Conspiracy against his Master and refusing to open the whole Secret to the King he was sent to the  Bastile  and there beheaded notwithstanding he sought for Mercy with great Importunities and in the most moving Manner There are other Instances in this King's Reign who notwithstanding was remarkabable for his Clemency of Rebels and Conspirators who were hanged beheaded or broken alive on the Wheel  The late King  William  was not disturbed by any Rebellion from those who had once submitted to him But we know he treated the Persons concerned in the AssassinationPlot as so horrid a Conspiracy deserved As for the Saying which this Author imputes to that Monarch it being a Piece of secret History one doth not know when it was spoken or what it alluded to unless the Author had been more particular in the Account of it  The Author proceeds in the next Place to no less an Authority than that of  Solomon    Among all the general Observations of the wisest Princes we know of I think there is none holds more universally than Mercy and Truth preserve a King and his Throne is established in Mercy  p If we compare the different Sayings of this wise King which relate to the Conduct of Princes we cannot question but that he means by this Mercy that kind of it which is consistent with Reason and Government and by which we  hope to see his Majesty's Throne established But our Author shou'd consider that the same wise Man has said in another Place that "An evil Man seeketh Rebellion therefore a cruel Messenger shall be sent against him" Accordingly his Practice was agreeable to his Proverb No Prince having ever given a greater Testimony of his Abhorrence to Undertakings of this treasonable Nature For he dispatched such a cruel Messenger as is here mentioned to those who had been engaged in a Rebellion many Years before he himself was on the Throne and even to his elder Brother upon the bare Suspicion that he was projecting so wicked an Enterprize  How the Example of the Pretender came into this Argument I am at a Loss to find out  The Pretender declared a general Pardon to All And shall our rightful King shew himself less the true Father of his People and afford his Pardon to none  c p The Pretender's general Pardon was to a People who were not in his Power and had he ever reduced them under it it was only promised to such as immediately joined with him for the Recovery of what he called his Right It was such a general Pardon as would have been consistent with the Execution of more than nine Parts in ten of the Kingdom  There is but one more Historical Argument which is drawn from King  Philip  's Treatment of the  Catalans I think it would not be unseasonable for some Men to recollect what their own Notions were of the Treatment of the  Catalans  how many Declamations were made on the Barbarity used towards them by King  Philip  c  p If the Author remembers these Declamations as he calls them were not made so much on the Barbarity  used towards them by King  Philip  as on the Barbarity used towards them by the  English  Government King  Philip  might have some Colour for treating them as Rebels but we ought to have regarded them as Allies and were obliged by all the Ties of Honour Conscience and publick Faith to have shelter'd them from those Sufferings which were brought upon them by a firm and inviolable Adherence to our Interest However none can draw into a Parallel the Cruelties which have been inflicted on that unhappy People with those few Instances of Severity which our Government has been obliged to exert towards the  British  Rebels I say no Man would make such a Parallel unless his Mind be so blinded with Passion and Prejudice as to assert in the Language of this Pamphlet  That no Instances can be produced of the least Lenity under the present Administration from the first Hour it commenc'd to this Day  p with other astonishing Reflexions of the same Nature which are contradicted by such innumerable Matters of Fact that it would be an Affront to a Reader's Understanding to endeavour to confute them But to return to the  Catalans    During the whole Course of the War  says the Author  which ever of them submitted to Discretion were received to Mercy  p This is so far from being truly related that in the beginning of the War they were executed without Mercy But when in Conjunction with their Allies they became Superior to King  Philip  's Party in Strength and extended their Conquests up to the very Gates of  Madrid  it cannot be supposed the  Spanish  Court would be so infatuated as to persist in their first Severities against an Enemy that could make such terrible Reprizals However  when this Reason of State ceased how dreadful was the Havock made among this brave but unhappy People The whole Kingdom without any Distinction to the many Thousands of its innocent Inhabitants was stript of its Immunities and reduced to a State of Slavery  Barcelona  was filled with Executions and all the Patriots of their antient Liberties either beheaded stowed in Dungeons or condemned to work in the Mines of  America  God be thanked we have a King who punishes with Reluctancy and is averse to such Cruelties as were us'd among the  Catalans  as much as to those practised on the Persons concern'd in  Monmouth  's Rebellion Our Author indeed condemns these  Western  Assizes in King  James  's Reign p And it would be well if all those who still adhere to the Cause of that unfortunate King and are clamorous at the Proceedings of his present Majesty would remember that notwithstanding that Rebellion fell very much short of this both in the Number and Strength of the Rebels and had no Tendency either to destroy the National Religion to introduce an Arbitrary Government or to subject us to a Foreign Power not only the Chief of the Rebels was beheaded but even a Lady who had only harbour'd one of the Offenders in her House was in her extreme old Age put to the same kind of Death That about two hundred and thirty were hanged drawn and quartered and their Limbs dispersed through several Parts of the Countrey and set up as Spectacles of Terror to their FellowSubjects It would be too tedious a Work to run through the numberless Fines Imprisonments Corporal Punishments and Transportations which  were then likewise practised as wholsome Severities  We have now seen how fallaciously the Author has stated the Cause he has undertaken by supposing that nothing but unlimited Mercy or unlimited Punishment are the Methods that can be made use of in our present Treatment of the Rebels That he has omitted the middle way of Proceeding between these two Extremes That this middle Way is the Method in which His Majesty like all other wise and good Kings has chosen to proceed That it is agreeable to the Nature of Government Religion and our  British  Constitution And that every Argument which the Author has produced from Reason and Example would have been a true one had it been urged for that restrain'd Clemency which His Majesty has exercised But is a false one when apply'd to such a general undistinguishing Mercy as the Author would recommend  Having thus answered that which is the main Drift and Design of this Pamphlet I shall touch upon those other Parts of it which are interwoven with the Arguments to put Men out of Humour with the present Government  And here we may observe that it is our Author's Method to suppose Matters of Fact which are not in being and afterwards to descant upon them As he is very sensible that the Cause will not bear the Test of Reason he has indeed every where chosen rather Topicks for Declamation than Argument▪ Thus he entertains us with a laboured Invective against a standing Army But what has this to do in the present Case I suppose he wou'd not advise his Majesty to disband his Forces while there is an  Army of Rebels in his Dominions I cannot imagine he would think the Affections of the People of  England  a Security of the Government in such a Juncture were it not at the same time defended with a sufficient Body of Troops No Prince has ever given a greater Instance of his Inclinations to rule without a StandingArmy if we consider that upon the very first News of the Defeat of the Rebels he declared to both Houses of Parliament that he had put an immediate Stop to the Levies which he had begun to raise at their Request and that he would not make use of the Power which they had entrusted him with unless any new Preparations of the Enemy should make it necessary for our Defence This Speech was receiv'd with the greatest Gratitude by both Houses and it is said that in the House of Commons a very can did and honourable Gentleman who generally votes with the Minority declared that he had not heard so gracious a Speech from the Throne for many Years last past  In another Place he supposes that the Government has not endeavoured to gain the Applause of the Vulgar by doing something for the Church and very gravely makes Excuses for this their pretended Neglect What greater Instances could His Majesty have given of his Love to the Church of  England  than those he has exhibited by his most solemn Declarations by his daily Example and by his Promotions of the most eminent among the Clergy to such Vacancies as have happened in his Reign To which we must add for the Honour of his Government in this Particular That it has done more for the Advantage of the Clergy than those who are the  most zealous for their Interest could have expected in so short a Time which will farther appear if we reflect upon the valuable and Royal Donative to one of our Universities and the Provision made for those who are to officiate in the Fifty New Churches His Majesty is indeed a Prince of too much Magnanimity and Truth to make use of the Name of the Church for drawing his People into any thing that may be prejudicial to them for what our Author says to this Purpose redounds as much to the Honour of the present Administration as to the Disgrace of others  Nay I wish with all my Soul they had stooped a little  ad captum vulgi  to take in those shallow fluttering Hearts which are to be caught by any thing baited with the Name of  Church  p      Again The Author asks  Whether Terror is to become the only National Principle  With other Questions of the same Nature And in several Parts of his Book harangues very plentifully against such a Notion Where he talks in Generals upon this Topick there is no question but every  Whig  and  Tory  in the Kingdom perfectly agree with him in what he says But if he would insinuate as he seems to do in several Places that there should be no Impressions of Awe upon the Mind of a Subject and that a Government should not create Terror in those who are disposed to do ill as well as encourage those that do their Duty In short if he is for an entire Exclusion of that Principle of Fear which is supposed to have some Influence in every Law he opposes himself to the Form of every Government in the World and to the Common Sense of Mankind  The Artifice of this Author in starting Objections  to the Friends of the Government and the foolish Answers which he supposes they return to them is so very visible that every one sees they are designed rather to divert his Reader than to instruct him  I have now examined this whole Pamphlet which indeed is written with a great deal of Art and as much Argument as the Cause would bear And after having stated the true Notion of Clemency Mercy Compassion Goodnature Humanity or whatever else it may be called so far as it is consistent with Wisdom and the Good of Mankind or in other Words so far as it is a moral Virtue I shall readily concur with the Author in the highest Panegyricks that he has bestowed upon it As likewise I heartily join with him in every thing he has said against Justice if it includes as his Pamphlet supposes the Extirpation of every Criminal and is not exercised with a much greater Mixture of Clemency than Rigour Mercy in the true Sense of the Word is that Virtue by which a Prince approaches nearest to Him whom he represents and whilst he is neither remiss nor extreme to animadvert upon those who offend him that Logick will hold true of him which is apply'd to the Great Judge of all the Earth  With thee there is Mercy therefore shalt thou be Feared  No Monday April  Heu miserae Cives non hostem inimicaque castra  Argivum vestras spes uritis  Virg  I Question not but the  British  Ladies are very well pleased with the Compliment I have payed them in the Course of my Papers by regarding them not only as the most amiable but as the most important Part of our Community They ought indeed to resent the Treatment they have met with from other Authors who have never troubled their Heads about them but address'd all their Arguments to the Male Half of their FellowSubjects and taken it for granted that if they could bring these into their Measures the Females would of Course follow their political Mates The Arguments they have made use of are like  Hudibras  's Spur which he apply'd to one Side of his Horse as not doubting but the other would keep Pace with it These Writers seem to have regarded the Fair Sex but as the Garniture of a Nation and when they consider them as Parts of the Commonwealth it is only as they are of use to the Consumption of our Manufacture  Could we perswade our  British  Women  says one of our eminent Merchants in a Letter to his Friend in the Countrey upon the Subject of Commerce  to cloath themselves in the comely Apparel which might be made out of the Wooll of their own Countrey and instead of Coffee Tea and Chocolate to delight in those wholsome and palatable  Liquors which may be extracted from our  British  Simples they would be of great Advantage to Trade and therein to the Publick Weal  It is now however become necessary to treat our Women as Members of the Body Politick since it is visible that great Numbers of them have of late eloped from their Allegiance and that they do not believe themselves obliged to draw with us as YokeFellows in the Constitution They will judge for themselves look into the State of the Nation with their own Eyes and be no longer led Blindfold by a Male Legislature A Friend of mine was lately complaining to me that his Wife had turned off one of the best CookMaids in  England  because the Wench had said something to her FellowServants which seemed to favour the Suspension of the  HabeasCorpus  Act  When Errors and Prejudices are thus spread among the Sex it is the hardest thing in the World to root them out Arguments which are the only proper Means for it are of little use They have a very short Answer to all Reasonings that turn against them  Make us believe That if you can  which is in  Latin  if I may upon this occasion be allowed the Pedantry of a Quotation  Non persuadebis etiamsi persuaseris  I could not but smile at a young University Disputant who was complaining the other Day of the Unreasonableness of a Lady with whom he was engaged in a Point of Controversy Being left alone with her he took the opportunity of pursuing an Argument which had been before started in Discourse and put it to her in a Syllogism Upon which as he informed us with some Heat she granted him him both the Major  and the Minor but deny'd him the Conclusion  The best Method therefore that can be made use of with these polemical Ladies who are much more easy to be Refuted than Silenced is to shew them the ridiculous Side of their Cause and to make them laugh at their own Politicks It is a kind of ill Manners to offer Objections to a fine Woman and a Man would be out of Countenance that should gain the Superiority in such a Contest A Coquette Logician may be railly'd but not contradicted Those who would make use of solid Arguments and strong Reasonings to a Reader or Hearer of so delicate a Turn would be like that foolish People whom  Aelian  speaks of that worshipped a Fly and sacrificed an Ox to it  The Truth of it is a Man must be of a very disputatious Temper that enters into StateControversies with any of the fair Sex If the Malignant be not Beautiful she cannot do much Mischief and if she is her Arguments will be so enforced by the Charms of her Person that her Antagonist may be in danger of betraying his own Cause  Milton  puts this Confession into the Mouth of our Father  Adam  who tho' he asserts his Superiority of Reason in his Debates with the Mother of Mankind adds  Yet when I approach  Her Loveliness so absolute she seems  And in herself Complete so well to know  Her own that what she wills to do or say  Seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best  All higher Knowledge in her presence falls  Degraded Wisdom in Discourse with her  Loses discount'nanc'd and like Folly shews  Authority and Reason on her wait  If there is such a native Loveliness in the Sex as to make them Victorious even when they are in the wrong how resistless is their Power when they are on the Side of Truth And indeed it is a peculiar good Fortune to the Government that our Fair Malecontents are so much overmatched in Beauty as well as Number by those who are Loyal to their King and Friends to their Countrey  Every Paper which I have hitherto address'd to our beautiful Incendiaries hath been filled with Considerations of a different Kind by which Means I have taken Care that those who are Enemies to the Sex or to my self may not accuse me of Tautology or pretend that I attack them with their own Weapon For this Reason I shall here lay together a new Set of Remarks and observe the several Artifices by which the Enemies to our Establishment do raise such unaccountable Passions and Prejudices in the Minds of our discontented Females  In the first Place it is usual among the most Cunning of our Adversaries to represent all the Rebels as very handsome Men If the Name of a Traitor be mentioned they are very particular in describing his Person and when they are not able to extenuate his Treason commend his Shape This has so good an Effect in one of our Female Audiences that they represent to themselves a thousand poor tall innocent freshcoloured young Gentlemen who are dispers'd among the several Prisons of  Great Bretain  and extend their generous Compassion towards a Multitude of agreeable Fellows that never were in being  Another Artifice is to instill Jealousies into their Minds of Designs upon the Anvil to retrench  the Privileges of the Sex Some represent the  Whigs  as Enemies to  Flanders  Lace Others had spread a Report that in the late Act of Parliament for four Shillings in the Pound upon Land there would be inserted a Clause for raising a Tax upon PinMoney That the Ladies may be the better upon their Guard against Suggestions of this Nature I shall beg Leave to put them in mind of the Story of  Papirius  the Son of a  Roman  Senator This young Gentleman after having been present in publick Debates was usually teazed by his Mother to inform her of what had passed In order to deliver himself from this Importunity he told her one Day upon his Return from the SenateHouse that there had been a Motion made for a Decree to allow every Man two Wives The good Lady said nothing but managed Matters so well among the  Roman  Matrons that the next Day they met together in a Body before the SenateHouse and presented a Petition to the Fathers against so unreasonable a Law This groundless Credulity raised so much Raillery upon the Petitioners that we do not find the Ladies offer'd to direct the Lawgivers of their Countrey ever after  There has been another Method lately made use of which has been practised with extraordinary Success I mean the spreading abroad Reports of Prodigies which has wonderfully gratified the Curiosity as well as the Hopes of our fair Malignants Their Managers turn Water into Blood for them frighten them with SeaMonsters make them see Armies in the Air and give them their Word the more to ingratiate themselves with them that they signify nothing less than future Slaughter and Desolation  The disloyal Part of the Sex immediately hug themselves at the News of the Bloody Fountain look upon these Fish as their Friends have great Expectations from the Clouds and are very angry with you if you think they do not All portend Ruine to their Countrey  Secret History and Scandal have always had their Allurements and I have in other Discourses shewn the great Advantage that is made of them in the present Ferment among the fair Ones  But the Master Engine to overturn the Minds of the Female World is the  Danger of the Church  I am not so uncharitable as to think there is any thing in an Observation made by several of the  Whigs  that there is scarce a Woman in  England  who is troubled with the Vapours but is more or less affected with this Cry Or to remark with others that it is not utter'd in any part of the Nation with so much Bitterness of Tongue and Heart as in the Districts of  Drurylane  On the contrary I believe there are many devout and honourable Women who are deluded in this Point by the Artifice of designing Men To these therefore I would apply my self in a more serious Manner and desire them to consider how that laudable Piety which is natural to the Sex is apt to degenerate into a groundless and furious Zeal when it is not kept within the Bounds of Charity and Reason Female Zeal though proceeding from so good a Principle has been infinitely detrimental to Society and to Religion itself If we may believe the  French  Historians it often put a Stop to the Proceedings of their Kings which might have ended in a  Reformation For upon their breaking with the Pope the Queens frequently interposed and by their Importunities reconciled them to the Usurpations of the Church of  Rome  Nay it was this vicious Zeal which gave a remarkable Check to the first Progress of Christianity as we find it recorded by a sacred Historian in the following Passage which I shall leave to the Consideration of my Female Readers  But the  Jews  stirred up the devout and honourable Women and the chief Men of the City and raised a Persecution against  Paul  and  Barnabas  and expelled them out of their Coasts  No Friday April  Nulli adversus Magistratus ac Reges gratiores sunt nec immerito nullis enim plus praestant quam quibus frui tranquillo otio licet Itaque hi quibus ad propositum bene vivendi confert Securitas publica necesse est auctorem hujus boni ut parentem colant  Senec Ep  WE find by our publick Papers the University of  Dublin  have lately presented to the Prince of  Wales  in a most humble and dutiful Manner their Diploma for constituting His Royal Highness Chancellor of that Learned Body and that the Prince received this their Offer with the Goodness and Condescension which is natural to his illustrious House As the College of  Dublin  have been long famous for their great Learning they have now given us an Instance of their Good Sense and it is  with Pleasure that we find such a Disposition in this famous Nursery of Letters to propagate sound Principles and to act in its proper Sphere for the Honour and Dignity of the Royal Family We hope that such an Example will have its Influence on other Societies of the same Nature and cannot but rejoice to see the Heir of  Great Britain  vouchsafing to Patronize in so peculiar a Manner that Noble Seminary which is perhaps at this Time training up such Persons as may hereafter be Ornaments to his Reign  When Men of Learning are acted thus by a Knowledge of the World as well as of Books and shew that their Studies naturally inspire them with a Love to their King and Countrey they give a Reputation to Literature and convince the World of its Usefulness But when Arts and Sciences are so perverted as to dispose Men to act in Contradiction to the rest of the Community and to set up for a kind of separate Republick among themselves they draw upon them the Indignation of the Wise and the Contempt of the Ignorant  It has indeed been observed that Persons who are very much esteemed for their Knowledge and Ingenuity in their private Characters have acted like Strangers to Mankind and to the Dictates of right reason when joined together in a Body Like several Chymical Waters that are each of them clear and transparent when separate but ferment into a thick troubled Liquor when they are mixed in the same Vial  There is a Piece of Mythology which bears very hard upon Learned Men and which I shall here relate rather for the Delicacy of the Satyr  than for the Justness of the Moral When the City of  Athens  was finished we are told that  Neptune  and  Minerva  presented themselves as Candidates for the Guardianship of the Place The  Athenians  after a full Debate upon the Matter came to an Election and made choice of  Minerva  Upon which  Neptune  who very much resented the Indignity upbraided them with their Stupidity and Ignorance that a Maritime Town should reject the Patronage of him who was the God of the Seas and could defend them against all the Attacks of their Enemies He concluded with a Curse upon the Inhabitants which was to stick to them and their Posterity namely  That they should be all Fools  When  Minerva  their Tutelary Goddess who presides over Arts and Sciences came among them to receive the Honour they had conferr'd upon her they made heavy Complaints of the Curse which  Neptune  had laid upon the City and begg'd her if possible to take it off But she told them it was not in her Power for that one Deity could not reverse the Act of another  However  said she  I may alleviate the Curse which I cannot remove It is not possible for me to hinder you from being Fools but I will take care that you shall be Learned  There is nothing which Bodies of Learned Men should be more careful of than by all due Methods to cultivate the Favour of the Great and Powerful The Indulgence of a Prince is absolutely necessary to the Propagation the Defence the Honour and Support of Learning It naturally creates in Men's Minds an Ambition to distinguish themselves by Letters and multiplies the Number of those who are dedicated to the Pursuits of Knowledge It protects them against  the Violence of Brutal Men and gives them Opportunities to pursue their Studies in a State of Peace and Tranquillity It puts the Learned in Countenance and gives them a Place among the fashionable Part of Mankind It distributes Rewards and encourages Speculative Persons who have neither Opportunity nor a Turn of Mind to increase their own Fortunes with all the Incentives of Place Profit and Preferment On the contrary nothing is in itself so pernicious to Communities of Learned Men nor more apprehended by those that wish them well than the Displeasure of their Prince which those may justly expect to feel who would make use of his Favour to his own Prejudice and put in Practice all the Methods that lye within their Power to vilify his Person and distress his Government In both these Cases a Learned Body is in a more particular Manner exposed to the Influence of their King as described by the wisest of Men  The Wrath of a King is as the Roaring of a Lion but his Favour is as the Dew upon the Grass  We find in our  English  Histories that the Empress  Matilda  who was the great Ancestor of His present Majesty and whose Granddaughter of the same name has a Place upon several of the  Hanover  Medals was particularly favoured by the University of  Oxford  and defended in that Place when most Parts of the Kingdom had revolted against her Nor is it to be questioned but an University so famous for Learning and sound Knowledge will shew the same Zeal for her illustrious Descendent as they will every Day discern His Majesty's Royal Virtues through those Prejudices which have been raised in their Minds by artful and designing Men It is  with much Pleasure we see this great Fountain of Learning already beginning to run clear and recovering its Natural Purity and Brightness None can imagine that a Community which is taxed by the worst of its Enemies only for overstraining the Notions of Loyalty even to bad Princes will fall short of a due Allegiance to the best  When this happy Temper of Mind is fully established among them we may justly hope to see the largest Share of His Majesty's Favours fall upon that University which is the Greatest and upon all Accounts the most Considerable not only in his Dominions but in all  Europe  I shall conclude this Paper with a Quotation out of  Cambden  's History of Queen  Elizabeth  who after having described that Queen's Reception at  Oxford  gives an Account of the Speech which she made to them at her Departure concluding with a Piece of Advice to that University Her Counsel was  That they would first serve God not after the Curiosity of some but according to the Laws of God and the Land that they would not go before the Laws but follow them nor dispute whether better might be prescribed but keep those prescribed already obey their Superiors and lastly embrace one another in Brotherly Piety and Concord  No Monday April  saevus apertam  In rabiem coepit verti jocus  Hor  IT is very justly as well as frequently observed that if our Nation be ever ruined it must be by itself The Parties and Divisions which reign among us may several Ways bring Destruction upon our Countrey at the same Time that our united Force would be sufficient to secure us against all the Attempts of a foreign Enemy Whatever Expedients therefore can be found to allay those Heats and Animosities which break us into different Factions and Interests cannot but be useful to the Publick and highly tend to its Safety Strength and Reputation  This dangerous Dissention among us discovers itself in all the most indifferent Circumstances of Life We keep it up and cherish it with as much Pains as if it were a kind of National Blessing It insinuates itself into all our Discourses mixes in our Parties of Pleasure has a Share in our Diversions and is an Ingredient in most of our publick Entertainments  I was not long ago at the Play call'd Sir  Courtly Nice  where to the eternal Reproach of good Sense I found the whole Audience had very gravely ranged themselves into two Parties under  Hothead  and  Testimony Hothead  was the applauded Hero of the  Tories  and  Testimony  no  less the Favourite of the  Whigs  Each Party followed their Champion It was wonderful to see so polite an Assembly distinguishing themselves by such extraordinary Representatives and avowing their Principles as conformable either to the Zeal of  Hothead  or the Moderation of  Testimony  Thus the two Parts which were designed to expose the Faults of both Sides and were accordingly received by our Ancestors in King  Charles  the Second's Reign meet with a kind of Sanction from the Applauses which are respectively bestowed on them by their wise Posterity We seem to imagine that they were written as Patterns for Imitation not as Objects of Ridicule  This Humour runs so far that most of our late Comedies owe their Success to it The Audience listens after nothing else I have seen little  Dicky  place himself with great Approbation at the Head of the  Tories  for five Acts together and  Pinky  espouse the Interest of the  Whigs  with no less Success I do not find that either Party has yet thrown themselves under the Patronage of Scaramouch or that Harlequin has violated that Neutrality which upon his late Arrival in  Great Britain  he professed to both Parties and which it is thought he will punctually observe being allowed on all Sides to be a Man of Honour It is true that upon his first Appearance a violent  Whig  Tradesman in the Pit begun to compliment him with a Clap as overjoyed to see him mount a Ladder and fancying Him to be drest in a Highland Plad  I question not but my Readers will be surprised to find me animadverting on a Practice that has been always favourable to the Cause  which now prevails The  British  Theatre was  Whig  even in the worst of Times and in the last Reign did not scruple to testify its Zeal for the Good of our Countrey by many magnanimous Claps in its lower Regions answered with loud Huzzas from the upper Gallery This good Disposition is so much heightened of late that the whole Neighbourhood of the  Drurylane  Theater very often shakes with the Loyalty of the Audience It is said that a young Author who very much relies on this prevailing Humour is now writing a Farce to be called  A Match out of Newgate  in Allusion to the Title of a Comedy called  A Match in Newgate  and that his chief Person is  a roundshoulder'd Man with a pretty large Nose and a wide Mouth  making his Addresses to a lovely black Woman that passes for a Peeress of  Great Britain  In short the whole Play is built upon the late Escape of General  Forster  who is supposed upon the Road to fall in Love with my Lord  Nithisdale  whom the Ingenious Author imagines to be still in his RidingHood  But notwithstanding the good Principles of a  British  Audience in this one Particular it were to be wished that every thing should be banished the Stage which has a Tendency to exasperate Men's Minds and enflame that Party Rage which makes us such a miserable and divided People And that in the first Place because such a Proceeding as this disappoints the very Design of all publick Diversions and Entertainments The Institution of Sports and Shews was intended by all Governments to turn off the Thoughts of the People from busying themselves in Matters of State which did not belong to them to reconcile them to one another by the  common Participations of Mirth and Pleasure and to wear out of their Minds that Rancour which they might have contracted by the interfering Views of Interest and Ambition It would therefore be for the Benefit of every Society that is disturbed by contending Factions to encourage such innocent Amusements as may thus disembitter the Minds of Men and make them mutually rejoice in the same agreeable Satisfactions When People are accustomed to sit together with Pleasure it is a Step towards Reconciliation But as we manage Matters our politest Assemblies are like boisterous Clubs that meet over a Glass of Wine and before they have done throw Bottles at one another's Heads Instead of multiplying those desirable Opportunities where we may agree in Points that are indifferent we let the Spirit of Contention into those very Methods that are not only foreign to it but should in their Nature dispose us to be Friends This our Anger in our Mirth is like Poison in a Perfume which taints the Spirits instead of chearing and refreshing them  Another manifest Inconvenience which arises from this Abuse of publick Entertainments is that it naturally destroys the Taste of an Audience I do not deny but that several Performances have been justly applauded for their Wit which have been written with an Eye to this predominant Humour of the Town But it is visible even in these that it is not the Excellence but the Application of the Sentiment that has raised Applause An Author is very much disappointed to find the best Parts of his Productions received with Indifference and to see the Audience discovering Beauties which he never intended The Actors in the midst of an innocent  old Play are often startled with unexpected Claps or Hisses and do not know whether they have been talking like good Subjects or have spoken Treason In short we seem to have such a Relish for Faction as to have lost that of Wit and are so used to the Bitterness of Party Rage that we cannot be gratified with the highest Entertainment that has not this kind of Seasoning in it But as no Work must expect to live long which draws all its Beauty from the Colour of the Times so neither can that Pleasure be of greater Continuance which arises from the Prejudice or Malice of its Hearers  To conclude Since the present Hatred and Violence of Parties is so unspeakably pernicious to the Community and none can do a Better Service to their Countrey than those who use their utmost endeavours to extinguish it we may reasonably hope that the more elegant Part of the Nation will give a good Example to the rest and put an end to so absurd and foolish a Practice which makes our most refined Diversions detrimental to the Publick and in a particular Manner destructive of all Politeness  No Friday April  Atheniensium res gestae sicut ego existumo satis amplae magnificaeque fuere verum aliquanto minores tamen quam fama feruntur Sed quia provenere ibi magna Scriptorum ingenia per terrarum orbem Atheniensium facta pro maxumis celebrantur Ita eorum qui ea fecere virtus tanta habetur quantum verbis ea potuere extollere praeclara ingenia  Sallust  GRATIAN  among his Maxims for raising a Man to the most consummate Character of Greatness advises first to perform extraordinary Actions and in the next Place to secure a good Historian Without the last he considers the first as thrown away as indeed they are in a great Measure by such illustrious Persons as make Fame and Reputation the End of their Undertakings The most shining Merit goes down to Posterity with Disadvantage when it is not placed by Writers in its proper Light  The Misfortune is that there are more Instances of Men who deserve this kind of Immortality than of Authors who are able to bestow it Our Countrey which has produced Writers of the first Figure in every other kind of Work has been very barren in good Historians We have had several who have been able to compile Matters of Fact but very few who have been able to digest them with that Purity and Elegance of Style that Nicety and  Strength of Reflection that Subtilty and Discernment in the Unravelling of a Character and that Choice of Circumstances for enlivening the whole Narration which we so justly admire in the antient Historians of  Greece  and  Rome  and in some Authors of our neighbouring Nations  Those who have succeeded best in Works of this kind are such who besides their natural good Sense and Learning have themselves been versed in publick Business and thereby acquired a thorough Knowledge of Men and Things It was the Advice of the great Duke of  Schomberg  to an eminent Historian of his Acquaintance who was an  Ecclesiastick  That he should avoid being too particular in the drawing up of an Army and other Circumstances of the Day of Battel for that he had always observed most notorious Blunders and Absurdities committed on that Occasion by such Writers as were not conversant in the Art of War We may reasonably expect the like Mistakes in every other kind of Publick Matters recorded by those who have only a distant Theory of such Affairs Besides it is not very probable that Men who have passed all their Time in low and vulgar Life should have a suitable Idea of the several Beauties and Blemishes in the Actions or Characters of Great Men For this Reason I find an old Law quoted by the famous Monsieur  Bayle  that no Person below the Dignity of a  Roman  Knight should presume to write an History  In  England  there is scarce any one who has had a Tincture of Reading or Study that is not apt to fancy himself equal to so great a Task tho' it is plain that many of our Countreymen  who have tampered in History frequently shew that they do not understand the very Nature of those Transactions which they recount Nay nothing is more usual than to see every Man who is versed in any particular Way of Business finding fault with several of these Authors so far as they treat of Matters within his Sphere  There is a Race of Men lately sprung up among this sort of Writers whom one cannot reflect upon without Indignation as well as Contempt These are our  GrubStreet  Biographers who watch for the Death of a great Man like so many Undertakers on purpose to make a Penny of him He is no sooner laid in his Grave but he falls into the Hands of an Historian who to swell a Volume ascribes to him Works which he never wrote and Actions which he never performed celebrates Virtues which he was never famous for and excuses Faults which he was never guilty of They fetch their only authentick Records out of  Doctors Commons  and when they have got a Copy of his last Will and Testament they fancy themselves furnished with sufficient Materials for his History This might indeed enable them in some Measure to write the History of his Death but what can we expect from an Author that undertakes to write the Life of a Great Man who is furnished with no other Matters of Fact besides Legacies and instead of being able to tell us what he did can only tell us what he bequeathed This manner of exposing the private Concerns of Families and sacrificing the Secrets of the Dead to the Curiosity of the Living is one of those licentious Practices which might well deserve the Animadversion of our  Government when it has Time to contrive Expedients for remedying the many crying Abuses of the Press In the mean while what a poor Idea must Strangers conceive of those Persons who have been famous among us in their Generation should they form their Notions of them from the Writings of these our Historiographers What would our Posterity think of their illustrious Forefathers should they only see them in such weak and disadvantageous Lights But to our Comfort Works of this Nature are so shortlived that they cannot possibly diminish the Memory of those Patriots which they are not able to preserve  The Truth of it is as the Lives of Great Men cannot be written with any tolerable Degree of Elegance or Exactness within a short Space after their Decease so neither is it fit that the History of a Person who has acted among us in a publick Character should appear till Envy and Friendship are laid asleep and the Prejudice both of his Antagonists and Adherents be in some Degree softned and subdued There is no question but there are several eminent Persons in each Party however they may represent one another at present who will have the same Admirers among Posterity and be equally celebrated by those whose Minds will not be distempered by Interest Passion or Partiality It were happy for us could we prevail upon our selves to imagine that one who differs from us in Opinion may possibly be an honest Man and that we might do the same Justice to one another which will be done us hereafter by those who shall make their Appearance in the World when this Generation is no more But in our present miserable and divided Condition  how just soever a Man's Pretensions may be to a great or blameless Reputation he must expect his Share of Obloquy and Reproach and even with regard to his Posthumous Character content himself with such a kind of Consideration as induced the famous  Sir Francis Bacon  after having bequeathed his Soul to God and his Body to the Earth to leave his Fame to foreign Nations and after some Years to his own Countrey  No Monday April  Illa se jactet in Aula  Virg  AMONG all the Paradoxes in Politicks which have been advanced by some among us there is none so absurd and shocking to the most ordinary Understanding as that it is possible for  Great Britain  to be quietly governed by a  Popish  Sovereign King  Henry  the Fourth found it impracticable for a  Protestant  to reign even in  France  notwithstanding the Reformed Religion does not engage a Prince to the Persecution of any other and notwithstanding the Authority of the Sovereign in that Countrey is more able to support it self and command the Obedience of the People than in any other  European  Monarchy We are convinced by the Experience of our own Times that our Constitution is not able to bear a  Popish  Prince at the Head of it King  James  the Second was endowed with many Royal Virtues and might have made a Nation of  RomanCatholicks  happy  under his Administration The Grievances we suffered in his Reign proceeded purely from his Religion But they were such as made the whole Body of the Nobility Clergy and Commonalty rise up as one Man against him and oblige him to quit the Throne of his Ancestors The Truth of it is we have only the Vices of a  Protestant  Prince to fear and may be made happy by his Virtues But in a  Popish  Prince we have no Chance for our Prosperity his very Piety obliges him to our Destruction and in Proportion as he is more Religious he becomes more Insupportable One would wonder therefore to find many who call themselves  Protestants  favouring the Pretensions of a Person who has been bred up in the utmost Bitterness and Bigotry of the Church of  Rome  and who in all Probability within less than a Twelvemonth would be opposed by those very Men that are industrious to set him upon the Throne were it possible for so wicked and unnatural an Attempt to succeed  I was some Months ago in a Company that diverted themselves with the Declaration which he had then published and particularly with the Date of it  In the Fourteenth Year of our Reign  The Company was surprized to find there was a King in  Europe  who had Reigned so long and made such a Secret of it This gave occasion to one of them who is now in  France  to enquire into the History of this remarkable Reign which he has digested into Annals and lately transmitted hither for the Perusal of his Friends  have suppressed such Personal Reflexions as are mixed in this short Chronicle as not being to the Purpose and find that the whole History of his Regal Conduct and Exploits may be  comprized in the remaining Part of this HalfSheet  The History of the  Pretender  's Fourteen Years Reign digested into Annals  ANno Regni    o  He made Choice of his Ministry the First of whom was his Confessor This was a Person recommended by the Society of Jesuits who represented him as one very proper to guide the Conscience of a King that hoped to rule over an Island which is not within the Pale of the Church He then proceeded to name the President of his Council his Secretaries of State and gave away a very honourable Sinecure to his principal Favourite by constituting him his LordHighTreasurer He likewise signed a dormant Commission for another to be his HighAdmiral with Orders to produce it whenever he had SeaRoom for his Employment  Anno Regni    o  He perfected himself in the Minuet Step  Anno Regni    o  He grew half a Foot  Anno Regni    o  He wrote a Letter to the Pope desiring him to be as kind to him as his Predecessor had been who was his Godfather In the same Year he ordered the LordHighTreasurer to pay off the Debts of the Crown which had been contracted since his Accession to the Throne particularly a MilkScore of three Years standing  Anno Regni    o  He very much improved himself in all Princely Learning having read over the Legends of the Saints with the History of those several Martyrs in  England  who had  attempted to blow up a whole Parliament of Hereticks  Anno Regni    o  He apply'd himself to the Arts of Government with more than ordinary Diligence took a Plan of the Bastile with his own hand visited the Galleys and studied the Edicts of his great Patron  Louis  XIV  Anno Regni    o  Being now grown up to Years of Maturity he resolved to seek Adventures but was very much divided in his Mind whether he should make an Expedition to  Scotland  or a Pilgrimage to  Loretto  being taught to look upon the latter in a religious Sense as the Place of his Nativity At length he resolved upon his  Scotch  Expedition and as the first Exertion of that Royal Authority which he was going to assume he Knighted himself After a short Piece of Errantry upon the Seas he got safe back to  Dunkirk  where he paid his Devotions to St  Antony  for having delivered him from the Dangers of the Sea and Sir  George Byng  Anno Regni    o  He made a Campaign in  Flanders  where by the Help of a Telescope he saw the Battle of  Oudenarde  and the Prince of  Hanover  's Horse shot under him being posted on a high Tower with two  French  Princes of the Blood  Anno Regni    o  He made a second Campaign in  Flanders  and upon his Return to the  French  Court gained a great Reputation by his Performance in a Rigadoon  Anno Regni    o  The Pope having heard the Fame of these his Military Atchievements made him the Offer of a Cardinal's Cap which he was advised not to accept by some of his Friends in  England  Anno Regni    o  He retir'd to  Lorrain  where every Morning he made great Havock among the WildFowl by the Advice and with the Assistance of his PrivyCouncil He is said this Summer to have shot with his own Hands fifty Brace of Pheasants and one wild Pig to have set thirty Coveys of Partridges and to have hunted down forty Brace of Hares to which he might have added as many Foxes had not most of them made their Escape by running out of his Friend's Dominions before his Dogs could finish the Chace He was particularly animated to these Diversions by his Ministry who thought they would not a little recommend him to the good Opinion and kind Offices of several  British  FoxHunters  Anno Regni    o  He made a Visit to the Duke  d'Aumont  and passed for a  French  Marquis in a Masquerade  Anno Regni    o  He visited several Convents and gathered Subscriptions from all the welldisposed Monks and Nuns to whom he communicated his Design of an Attempt upon  Great Britain  Anno Regni    o  He now made great Preparations for the Invasion of  England  and got together vast Stores of Ammunition consisting of Reliques GunPowder and CannonBall He received from the Pope a very large Contribution one Moiety in Money and the other in Indulgences An  Irish  Priest brought him an authentick Tooth of St  Thomas a Becket  and it is thought was to have for his Reward the Archbishoprick of  Canterbury  Every Monastery contributed something One gave him a thousand Pound and another as many Masses  This Year containing farther the Battels which he fought in  Scotland  and the Towns which he took is so fresh in every one's Memory that we shall say no more of it  No Friday April  quod si  Frigida curarum fomenta relinquere posses  Quo te coelestis sapientia duceret ires  Hoc opus hoc studium parvi properemus ampli  Si patriae volumus si nobis vivere cari  Hor  IT is a melancholy Reflection that our Countrey which in times of Popery was called the Nation of Saints should now have less appearance of Religion in it than any other neighbouring State or Kingdom whether they be such as continue still immersed in the Errors of the Church of  Rome  or such as are recovered out of them This is a Truth that is obvious to every one who has been conversant in foreign Parts It was formerly thought dangerous for a young Man to Travel lest he should return an  Atheist  to his native Countrey But at present it is certain that an  Englishman  who has any tolerable Degree of Reflection cannot be better awakened to a Sense of Religion in general than by observing how the Minds of all Mankind are set upon this important Point how every Nation is serious and attentive to the great Business of their Being and that in other Countries a Man is not out of the Fashion  who is bold and open in the Profession and Practice of all Christian Duties  This Decay of Piety is by no Means to be imputed to the  Reformation  which in its first Establishment produced its proper Fruits and distinguished the whole Age with shining Instances of Virtue and Morality If we would trace out the Original of that flagrant and avowed Impiety which has prevailed among us for some Years we should find that it owes its Rise to that opposite Extream of  Cant  and  Hypocrisie  which had taken Possession of the People's Minds in the Times of the great Rebellion and of the Usurpation that succeeded it The Practices of these Men under the Covert of a feigned Zeal made even the Appearances of sincere Devotion ridiculous and unpopular The Raillery of the Wits and Courtiers in King  Charles  the Second's Reign upon every thing which they then called Precise was carried to so great an Extravagance that it almost put Christianity out of Countenance The Ridicule grew so strong and licentious that from this time we may date that remarkable Turn in the Behaviour of our fashionable  Englishmen  that makes them Shamefaced in the Exercise of those Duties which they were sent into the World to perform  The late Cry of the  Church  has been an Artifice of the same Kind with that made use of by the Hypocrites of the last Age and has had as fatal an Influence upon Religion If a Man would but seriously consider how much greater Comfort he would receive in the last Moments of his Life from a Reflection that he has made one virtuous Man than that he has made a thousand  Tories  we should not see the Zeal of so  many Good Men turned off from its proper End and employed in making such a kind of Converts What Satisfaction will it be to an Immoral Man at such a Time to think he is a good  Whig  Or to one that is conscious of Sedition Perjury or Rebellion that he dies with the Reputation of a  HighChurchman    But to consider how this Cry of the  Church  has corrupted the Morals of both Parties Those who are the loudest in it regard themselves rather as a political than a religious Communion and are held together rather by StateNotions than by Articles of Faith This fills the Minds of weak Men who fall into the Snare with groundless Fears and Apprehensions unspeakable Rage towards their Fellow Subjects wrong Ideas of Persons whom they are not acquainted with and uncharitable Interpretations of those Actions of which they are not competent Judges It instills into their Minds the utmost Virulence and Bitterness instead of that Charity which is the Perfection and Ornament of Religion and the most indispensable and necessary Means for attaining the End of it In a Word among these mistaken Zealots it sanctifies Cruelty and Injustice Riots and Treason  The Effects which this Cry of the  Church  has had on the other Party are no less manifest and deplorable They see themselves unjustly aspersed by it and vindicate themselves in Terms no less opprobrious than those by which they are attacked Their Indignation and Resentment rises in Proportion to the Malice of their Adversaries The unthinking Part of them are apt to contract an unreasonable Aversion even to that Ecclesiastical Constitution to which they  are represented as Enemies and not only to particular Persons but to that Order of Men in general which will be always held Sacred and Honourable so long as there is Reason and Religion in the World  I might mention many other Corruptions common to both Parties which naturally flow from this Source and might easily shew upon a full Display of them that this Clamour which pretends to be raised for the Safety of Religion has almost worn out the very Appearance of it and rendered us not only the most divided but the most immoral People upon the Face of the Earth  When our Nation is overflowed with such a Deluge of Impiety it must be a great Pleasure to find any Expedient take Place that has a Tendency to recover it out of so dismal a Condition This is one great Reason why an honest Man may rejoyce to see an Act so near taking effect for making Elections of Members to serve in Parliament less frequent I find my self prevented by other Writings which have considered the Act now depending in this particular Light from expatiating upon this Subject I shall only mention two short Pieces which I have been just now reading under the following Titles  Arguments about the Alteration of the Triennial Elections of Parliament  And  The Alteration in the Triennial Act considered  The Reasons for this Law as it is necessary for settling His Majesty in his Throne for extinguishing the Spirit of Rebellion for procuring foreign Alliances and other Advantages of the like Nature carry a great Weight with them But I am particularly pleased with it as  it may compose our unnatural Feuds and Animosities revive an honest Spirit of Industry in the Nation and cut off frequent Occasions of brutal Rage and Intemperance In short as it will make us not only a more safe a more flourishing and a more happy but also a more Vertuous People  No Monday April  Longum formosa Vale  Virg  IT is the Ambition of the MalePart of the World to make themselves Esteemed and of the Female to make themselves Beloved As this is the last Paper which I shall address to my Fair Readers I cannot perhaps oblige them more than by leaving them as a kind of Legacy a certain Secret which seldom fails of procuring this Affection which they are naturally formed both to Desire and to Obtain This  Nostrum  is comprized in the following Sentence of  Seneca  which I shall translate for the Service of my Countreywomen  Ego tibi monstrabo Amatorium sine medicamento sine herba sine ullius Veneficae carmine si vis Amari Ama I will discover to you a Philter that has neither Drug nor Simple nor Enchantment in it Love if you would raise Love  If there be any Truth in this Discovery and this be such a Specifick as the Author pretends there is nothing which makes the Sex more unamiable than PartyRage The finest Woman in a Transport of Fury  loses the Use of her Face Instead of charming her Beholders she frights both Friend and Foe The latter can never be smitten by so bitter an Enemy nor the former captivated by a Nymph who upon Occasion can be so very Angry The most endearing of our beautiful FellowSubjects are those whose Minds are the least imbittered with the Passions and Prejudices of either Side and who discover the native Sweetness of the Sex in every part of their Conversation and Behaviour A lovely Woman who thus flourishes in her Innocence and GoodHumour amidst that mutual Spite and Rancour which prevails among her exasperated Sisterhood appears more amiable by the Singularity of her Character and may be compared with  Solomon  's Bride to  a Lilly among Thorns  A Stateswoman is as ridiculous a Creature as a CottQuean Each of the Sexes should keep within its particular Bounds and content themselves to excel within their respective Districts When  Venus  complained to  Jupiter  of the wound which she had received in Battel the Father of the Gods smiled upon her and put her in mind that instead of mixing in a War which was not her Business she should have been officiating in her proper Ministry and carrying on the Delights of Marriage The Delicacy of several modern Criticks has been offended with  Homer's Billingsgate  Warriors but a scolding Heroe is at the worst a more tolerable Character than a Bully in Petticoats To which we may add that the keenest Satyrist among the Antients looked upon nothing as a more proper Subject of Raillery and Invective than a Female Gladiator  I am the more disposed to take into Consideration these Ladies of Fire and Politicks because it would be very monstrous to see Feuds and Animosities kept up among the soft Sex when they are in so hopeful a Way of being composed among the Men by the Septennial Bill which is now ready for the Royal Assent As this is likely to produce a Cessation of Arms till the Expiration of the present Parliament among one half of our Island it is very reasonable that the more beautiful Moiety of His Majesty's Subjects should establish a Truce among themselves for the same Term of Years Or rather it were to be wished that they would summon together a kind of Senate or Parliament of the fairest and wisest of our Sister Subjects in order to enact a perpetual Neutrality among the Sex They might at least appoint something like a Committee chosen from among the Ladies residing in  London  and  Westminster  in order to prepare a Bill to be laid before the Assembly upon the first Opportunity of their Meeting The Regulation might be as follows  'That a Committee of Toasts be forthwith appointed to consider the present State of the Sex in the  British  Nation  'That this Committee do meet at the House of every respective Member of it on her Vi+sitingDay and that every one who comes  it shall have a Vote and a Dish of Tea  'That the Committee be empowered to  for Billetsdoux Libels Lampoons Li  Toasts or any other the like Papers and R  +cords  'That it be an Instruction to the said Com+mittee to consider or proper Ways and M  +thods  to reclaim the obstinately Opprobrious and Virulent and how to make the DuckingStool more useful'  Being always willing to contribute my Assistances to my Countreywomen I would propose a Preamble setting forth 'That the late Civil War among the Sex has tended very much to the Lessening of that antient and undoubted Authority which they have claimed over the Male Part of the Island to the Ruin of good Houswifery and to the Betraying of many important Secrets That it has produced much Bitterness of Speech many sharp and violent Contests and a great Effusion of CitronWater That it has raised Animosities in their Hearts and Heats in their Faces That it has broke out in their Ribbons and caused unspeakable Confusions in their Dress And above all That it has introduced a certain Frown into the Features and a Soureness into the Air of our  British  Ladies to the great Damage of their Charms and visible Decay of the National Beauty'  As for the enacting Part of the Bill it may  of many Particulars which will naturally arise from the Debates of the TeaTable and must therefore be left to the Discretion and Experience of the Committee Perhaps it might not be amiss to enact among other Things  'That the Discoursing on Politicks shall be  upon as dull as Talking on the Wea    'That if any Man troubles a Female Assembly with ParliamentNews he shall be marked out as a Blockhead or an Incendiary  'That no Woman shall henceforth presume to stick a Patch upon her Forehead unless it be in the very middle that is in the neutral part of it  'That all Fans and SnuffBoxes of what Principles soever shall be called in And that Orders be given to  Motteux  and  Mathers  to deliver out in exchange for them such as have no Tincture of Party in them  'That when any Lady bespeaks a Play she shall take effectual Care that the Audience be pretty equally checquered with  Whigs  and  Tories  'That no Woman of any Party presume to influence the Legislature  'That there be a general Amnesty and Oblivion of all former Hostilities and Distinctions all publick and private Failings on either side And that every one who comes into this Neutrality within the Space of Weeks shall be allowed an Ell extraordinary above the present Standard in the Circumference of her Petticoat  'Provided always nevertheless That nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to any Person or Persons Inhabiting and Practising within the Hundreds of  Drury  or to any other of that Society in what Part soever of the Nation in like manner Practising and Residing who are still at liberty to Rail Calumniate Scold Frown and Pout as in aforetimes any thing in this Act to the contrary notwithstanding'  No Friday May  Prodesse quam Conspici  IT often happens that extirpating the Love of Glory which is observed to take the deepest Root in noble Minds tears up several Virtues with it and that suppressing the Desire of Fame is apt to reduce Men to a State of Indolence and Supineness But when without any Incentive of Vanity a Person of great Abilities is zealous for the Good of Mankind and as solicitous for the Concealment as the Performance of illustrious Actions we may be sure that he has something more than ordinary in his Composition and has a Heart filled with Goodness and Magnanimity  There is not perhaps in all History a greater Instance of this Temper of Mind than what appeared in that excellent Person whose Motto I have placed at the Head of this Paper He had worn himself out in his Application to such Studies as made him useful or ornamental to the World in concerting Schemes for the Welfare of his Countrey and in prosecuting such Measures as were necessary for making those Schemes effectual But all this was done with a View to the Publick Good that should rise out of these generous Endeavours and not to the Fame which should accrue to himself Let the Reputation of the Action fall where it would so his Countrey reaped the Benefit of it he was  satisfied As this Turn of Mind threw off in a great Measure the Oppositions of Envy and Competition it enabled him to gain the most Vain and Impracticable into his Designs and to bring about several great Events for the Safety and Advantage of the Publick which must have died in their Birth had he been as desirous of appearing Beneficial to Mankind as of being so  As he was admitted into the secret and most retired Thoughts and Counsels of his Royal Master King  William  a great Share in the Plan of the Protestant Succession is universally ascribed to him And if he did not entirely project the Union of the two Kingdoms and the Bill of Regency which seem to have been the only Methods in Humane Policy for securing to us so inestimable a Blessing there is none who will deny him to have been the chief Conductor in both these glorious Works For Posterity are obliged to allow him that Praise after his Death which he industriously declined while he was Living His Life indeed seems to have been prolonged beyond its Natural Term under those Indispositions which hung upon the latter part of it that he might have the Satisfaction of seeing the happy Settlement take Place which he had proposed to himself as the principal End of all his publick Labours Nor was it a small Addition to his Happiness that by this Means he saw those who had been always his most intimate Friends and who had concerted with him such Measures for the Guaranty of the Protestant Succession as drew upon them the Displeasure of Men who were averse to it advanced to the highest Posts of Trust and Honour under His present Majesty  I believe there are none of these Patriots who will think it a Derogation from their Merit to have it said that they received many Lights and Advantages from their Intimacy with my Lord  Somers  Who had such a general Knowledge of Affairs and so tender a Concern for his Friends that whatever Station they were in they usually applied to him for his Advice in every Perplexity of Business and in Affairs of the greatest Difficulty  His Life was in every Part of it set off with that graceful Modesty and Reserve which made his Virtues more beautiful the more they were cast in such agreeable Shades  His Religion was sincere not ostentatious and such as inspired him with an universal Benevolence towards all his FellowSubjects not with Bitterness against any Part of them He shewed his firm Adherence to it as model'd by our national Constitution and was constant to its Offices of Devotion both in Publick and in his Family He appeared a Champion for it with great Reputation in the Cause of the seven Bishops at a Time when the Church was Really in Danger To which we may add that he held a strict Friendship and Correspondence with the Great Archbishop  Tillotson  being acted by the same Spirit of Candor and Moderation and moved rather with Pity than Indignation towards the Persons of those who differed from him in the unessential Parts of Christianity  His great Humanity appeared in the minutest Circumstances of his Conversation You found it in the Benevolence of his Aspect the Complacency of his Behaviour and the Tone of his Voice His great Application to the severer Studies of the Law had not infected his Temper  with any thing positive or litigious He did not know what it was to wrangle on indifferent Points to triumph in the Superiority of his Understanding or to be Supercilious on the Side of Truth He joined the greatest Delicacy of GoodBreeding to the greatest Strength of Reason By approving the Sentiments of a Person with whom he conversed in such Particulars as were just he won him over from those Points in which he was mistaken and had so agreeable a Way of conveying Knowledge that whoever conferred with him grew the wiser without perceiving that he had been instructed We may probably ascribe to this masterly and engaging Manner of Conversation the great Esteem which he had gained with the late Queen while she pursued those Measures which had carried the  British  Nation to the highest Pitch of Glory notwithstanding she had entertained many unreasonable Prejudices against him before she was acquainted with his personal Worth and Behaviour  As in his political Capacity we have before seen how much he contributed to the Establishment of the Protestant Interest and the Good of his Native Countrey he was always true to these great Ends His Character was uniform and consistent with itself and his whole Conduct of a Piece His Principles were founded in Reason and supported by Virtue and therefore did not lie at the Mercy of Ambition Avarice or Resentment His Notions were no less steady and unshaken than just and upright In a Word he concluded his Course among the same wellchosen Friendships and Alliances with which he began it  This Great Man was not more Conspicuous as a Patriot and a Statesman than as a Person of universal Knowledge and Learning As by dividing his Time between the publick Scenes of Business and the private Retirements of Life he took care to keep up both the Great and Good Man so by the same Means he accomplished himself not only in the Knowledge of Men and Things but in the Skill of the most refined Arts and Sciences That unwearied Diligence which followed him through all the Stages of his Life gave him such a thorough Insight into the Laws of the Land that he passed for one of the greatest Masters of his Profession at his first Appearance in it Though he made a regular Progress through the several Honours of the Long Robe he was always looked upon as one who deserved a Superior Station to that he was possessed of till he arrived at the highest Dignity to which those Studies could advance him  He enjoyed in the highest Perfection two Talents which do not often meet in the same Person the greatest Strength of good Sense and the most exquisite Taste of Politeness Without the first Learning is but an Incumbrance and without the last is ungraceful My Lord  Somers  was Master of these two Qualifications in so eminent a Degree that all the Parts of Knowledge appeared in him with such an additional Strength and Beauty as they want in the Possession of others If he delivered his Opinion of a Piece of Poetry a Statue or a Picture there was something so just and delicate in his Observations as naturally produced Pleasure and Assent in those who heard him  His Solidity and Elegance improved by the reading of the finest Authors both of the Learned and Modern Languages discovered itself in all his Productions His Oratory was masculine and persuasive free from every thing trivial and affected His Style in Writing was chaste and pure but at the same time full of Spirit and Politeness and fit to convey the most intricate Business to the Understanding of the Reader with the utmost Clearness and Perspicuity And here it is to be lamented that this extraordinary Person out of his natural Aversion to Vainglory wrote several Pieces as well as performed several Actions which he did not assume the Honour of Though at the same time so many Works of this Nature have appeared which every one has ascribed to him that I believe no Author of the greatest Eminence would deny my Lord  Somers  to have been the best Writer of the Age in which he lived  This noble Lord for the great Extent of his Knowledge and Capacity has been often compared with the Lord  Verulam  who had also been Chancellor of  England  But the Conduct of these two extraordinary Persons under the same Circumstances was vastly different They were both Impeached by a House of Commons One of them as he had given just Occasion for it sunk under it and was reduced to such an abject Submission as very much diminished the Lustre of so exalted a Character But my Lord  Somers  was too well fortified in his Integrity to fear the Impotence of an Attempt upon his Reputation and though his Accusers would gladly have dropped their Impeachment he was instant with them for the Prosecution of it and  would not let that Matter rest till it was brought to an Issue For the same Virtue and Greatness of Mind which gave him a Disregard of Fame made him impatient of an undeserved Reproach  There is no question but this wonderful Man will make one of the most distinguish'd Figures in the History of the present Age but we cannot expect that his Merit will shine out in its proper Light since he wrote many things which are not published in his Name was at the Bottom of many excellent Counsels in which he did not appear did Offices of Friendship to many Persons who knew not from whom they were derived and performed great Services to his Countrey the Glory of which was transfer'd to others In short since he made it his Endeavour rather to do worthy Actions than to gain an illustrious Character  No Monday May  Urit enim fulgore suo qui praegravat artes  Infra se positas extinctus amabitur idem  Hor  IT requires no small Degree of Resolution to be an Author in a Countrey so Facetious and Satyrical as this of  Great Britain  Such a one raises a kind of Alarm among his FellowSubjects and by pretending to distinguish himself from the Herd becomes a Mark of publick Censure and sometimes a standing Object of Raillery and Ridicule Writing is indeed a Provocation to the Envious and an Affront to the  Ignorant How often do we see a Person whose Intentions are visibly to do Good by the Works which he publishes treated in as scurrilous a Manner as if he were an Enemy to Mankind All the little Scramblers after Fame fall upon him publish every Blot in his Life depend upon Hearsay to defame him and have recourse to their own Invention rather than suffer him to erect himself into an Author with Impunity Even those who write on the most indifferent Subjects and are conversant only in Works of Taste are looked upon as Men that make a kind of Insult upon Society and ought to be humbled as Disturbers of the publick Tranquillity Not only the Dull and the Malicious which make a formidable Party in our Island but the whole Fraternity of Writers rise up in Arms against every new Intruder into the World of Fame and a thousand to one before they have done prove him not only to be a Fool but a Knave Successful Authors do what they can to exclude a Competitor while the Unsuccessful with as much Eagerness lay in their Claim to him as a Brother This natural Antipathy to a Man who breaks his Ranks and endeavours to signalize his Parts in the World has very probably hindered many Persons from making their Appearance in Print who might have enriched our Countrey with better Productions in all kinds than any that are now extant The Truth of it is the active Part of Mankind as they do most for the Good of their Contemporaries very deservedly gain the greatest Share in their Applauses whilst Men of Speculative Endowments who employ their Talents in Writing as they may equally benefit or amuse succeeding Ages have generally the greatest  Share in the Admiration of Posterity Both good and bad Writers may receive great Satisfaction from the Prospects of Futurity as in Afterages the former will be remember'd and the latter forgotten  Among all Sets of Authors there are none who draw upon themselves more Displeasure than those who deal in political Matters which indeed is very often too justly incurred considering that Spirit of Rancour and Virulence with which Works of this Nature generally abound These are not only regarded as Authors but as Partisans and are sure to exasperate at least one half of their Readers Other Writers offend only the Stupid or Jealous among their Countreymen but these let their Cause be never so Just must expect to irritate a supernumerary Party of the selfinterested prejudiced and ambitious They may however comfort themselves with considering that if they gain any unjust Reproach from one Side they generally acquire more Praise than they deserve from the other and that Writings of this kind if conducted with Candour and Impartiality have a more particular Tendency to the Good of their Countrey and of the present Age than any other Compositions whatsoever  To consider an Author farther as the Subject of Obloquy and Detraction We may observe with what Pleasure a Work is received by the invidious Part of Mankind in which a Writer falls short of himself and does not answer the Character which he has acquired by his former Productions It is a fine Simile in one of Mr  Congreve  's Prologues which compares a Writer to a Buttering Gamester that stakes  all his Winnings upon every Cast So that if he loses the last Throw he is sure to be undone It would be well for all Authors if like that Gentleman they knew when to give over and to desist from any farther Pursuits after Fame whilst they are in the full Possession of it On the other Hand there is not a more melancholy Object in the Learned World than a Man who has written himself down As the Publick is more disposed to Censure than to Praise his Readers will ridicule him for his last Works when they have forgot to applaud those which preceded them In this Case where a Man has lost his Spirit by old Age and Infirmity one could wish that his Friends and Relations would keep him from the use of Pen Ink and Paper if he is not to be reclaimed by any other Methods  The Author indeed often grows old before the Man especially if he treats on Subjects of Invention or such as arise from Reflections upon Human Nature For in this case neither his own Strength of Mind nor those Parts of Life which are commonly unobserved will furnish him with sufficient Materials to be at the same Time both pleasing and voluminous We find even in the outward Dress of Poetry that Men who write much without taking Breath very often return to the same Phrases and Forms of Expression as well as to the same Manner of Thinking Authors who have thus drawn off the Spirit of their Thoughts should lie still for some Time till their Minds have gathered fresh Strength and by Reading Reflection and Conversation laid in a new Stock of Elegancies Sentiments and Images of Nature The Soil that is worn with  too frequent Culture must lie fallow for a while till it has recruited its exhausted Salts and again enriched itself by the Ventilations of the Air the Dews of Heaven and the kindly Influences of the Sun  For my own Part notwithstanding this general Malevolence towards those who communicate their Thoughts in Print I cannot but look with a friendly Regard on such as do it provided there is no Tendency in their Writings to Vice and Prophaneness If the Thoughts of such Authors have nothing in them they at least do no harm and shew an honest Industry and a good Intention in the Composer If they teach me any thing I did not know before I cannot but look upon my self as obliged to the Writer and consider him as my particular Benefactor if he conveys to me one of the greatest Gifts that is in the Power of Man to bestow an Improvement of my Understanding an innocent Amusement or an Incentive to some moral Virtue Were not Men of Abilities thus communicative their Wisdom would be in a great Measure useless and their Experience uninstructive There would be no Business in Solitude nor proper Relaxations in Business By these Assistances the retir'd Man lives in the World if not above it Passion is composed Thought hindred from being barren and the Mind from preying upon itself That Esteem indeed which is paid to good Writers by their Posterity sufficiently shews the Merit of Persons who are thus employed Who does not now more admire  Cicero  as an Author than as a Consul of  Rome  And does not oftner talk of the celebrated Writers of our own Countrey who lived in former Ages than of any other particular  Persons among their Contemporaries and FellowSubjects  When I consider my self as a  British  Freeholder I am in a particular Manner pleased with the Labours of those who have improved our Language with the Translation of old  Latin  and  Greek  Authors and by that Means let us into the Knowledge of what passed in the famous Governments of  Greece  and  Rome  We have already most of their Historians in our own Tongue And what is still more for the Honour of our Language it has been taught to express with Elegance the Greatest of their Poets in each Nation The illiterate among our Countreymen may learn to judge from  Dryden  's  Virgil  of the most perfect Epic Performance And those Parts of  Homer  which have already been published by Mr  Pope  give us reason to think that the  Iliad  will appear in  English  with as little Disadvantage to that immortal Poem  There is another Author whom I have long wished to see well translated into  English  as his Work is filled with a Spirit of Liberty and more directly tends to raise Sentiments of Honour and Virtue in his Reader than any of the poetical Writings of Antiquity I mean the  Pharsalia  of  Lucan  This is the only Author of Consideration among the  Latin  Poets who was not explained for the Use of the  Dauphin  for a very obvious Reason because the whole  Pharsalia  would have been no less than a Satyr upon the  French  Form of Government The Translation of this Author is now in the Hands of Mr  Rowe  who has already given the World some admirable Specimens of it and not only kept up the Fire of the Original but delivered  the Sentiments with greater Perspicuity and in a finer Turn of Phrase and Verse  As Undertakings of so difficult a Nature require the greatest Encouragements one cannot but rejoyce to see those general Subscriptions which have been made to them especially since if the two Works last mentioned are not finished by those masterly Hands which are now employed in them we may despair of seeing them attempted by others  No Friday May  Dissentientis conditionibus  Foedis et exemplo trahenti  Perniciem veniens in aevum  Hor  AS the Care of our National Commerce redounds more to the Riches and Prosperity of the Publick than any other Act of Government it is pity that we do not see the State of it marked out in every particular Reign with greater Distinction and Accuracy than what is usual among our  English  Historians We may however observe in general that the best and wisest of our Monarchs have not been less industrious to extend their Trade than their Dominions as it manifestly turns in a much higher Degree to the Welfare of the People if not to the Glory of the Soveraign  The first of our Kings who carried our Commerce and consequently our Navigation to a very great Height was  Edward  the Third This victorious Prince by his many excellent Laws  for the Encouragement of Trade enabled his Subjects to support him in his many glorious Wars upon the Continent and turned the Scale so much in Favour of our  English  Merchandise that by a Balance of Trade taken in his Time the Exported Commodities amounted to Two Hundred Ninety Four Thousand Pounds and the Imported but to Thirty Eight Thousand  Those of his Successors under whose Regulations our Trade flourish'd most were  Henry  the Seventh and Queen  Elizabeth  As the first of these was for his great Wisdom very often styled the  English Solomon  he followed the Example of that wise King in nothing more than by advancing the Traffick of his People By this Means he reconciled to him the Minds of his Subjects strengthened himself in their Affections improved very much the Navigation of the Kingdom and repelled the frequent Attempts of his Enemies  As for Queen  Elizabeth  she had always the Trade of her Kingdom very much at Heart and we may observe the Effects of it through the whole Course of her Reign in the Love and Obedience of her People as well as in the Defeats and Disappointments of her Enemies  It is with great Pleasure that we see our present Soveraign applying his Thoughts so successfully to the Advancement of our Traffick and considering himself as the King of a Trading Island His Majesty has already gained very considerable Advantages for his People and is still employed in concerting Schemes and forming Treaties for retrieving and enlarging our Privileges in the World of Commerce  I shall only in this Paper take Notice of the Treaty concluded at  Madrid  on the  th  of  December  last and by comparing it with that concluded at  Utrecht  on the  th  of  December  shew several particulars in which the Treaty made with his present Majesty is more advantageous to  Great Britain  than that which was made in the last Reign after this general Observation that it is equally surprizing how so bad a Treaty came to be made at the end of a glorious and successful War and how so good a One has been obtained in the Beginning of a Reign disturbed by such intestine Commotions But we may learn from hence that the Wisdom of a Soveraign and the Integrity of his Ministers are more necessary for bringing about Works of such Consequence for the publick Good than any Juncture of Time or any other the most favourable Circumstance  We must here premise that by the Treaty concluded at  Madrid  in the Duties of Importation payable upon the Manufactures and Products of  Great Britain  amounted upon the established Valuation in the  Spanish  Book of Rates after the Deduction of the Gratia's In  Andalusia  to ⅓  per Cent  in  Valentia  to  per Cent  and in  Catalonia  to about  per Cent  or less and consequently upon the whole aforesaid Trade those Duties could not exceed  per Cent  in a medium  After this short Account of the State of our Trade with  Spain  before the Treaty of  Utrecht  under the late Queen we must observe that by the explanatory Articles of this last mentioned Treaty the Duties of Importation upon the Products and Manufactures of  Great Britain  were augmented in  Andalusia  to ⅕  per Cent  at a Medium  But by the late Treaty made with His present Majesty at  Madrid  the said Duties are again reduced according to the aforesaid Treaty of And the Deduction of the Gratia's is established as an inviolable Law whereas before the Gratia's of the Farmers particularly were altogether precarious and depended entirely upon Courtesy  That the common Reader may understand the Nature of these Gratia's he must know that when the King of  Spain  had laid higher Duties upon our  English  Goods than what the Merchants were able or willing to comply with he used to abate a certain Part which Indulgence or Abatement went under the Name of a Gratia But when he had Farmed out these his Customs to several of his Subjects the Farmers in order to draw more Merchandise to their respective Ports and thereby to increase their own particular Profits used to make new Abatements or Gratia's to the  British  Merchants endeavouring sometimes to outvy one another in such Indulgences and by that Means to get a greater Proportion of Custom into their own Hands  But to proceed The Duties on Exportation may be computed to be raised by the  Utrecht  Treaty near as much as the foresaid Duties of Importation Whereas by the Treaty made with His present Majesty they are reduced to their ancient Standard  Complaint having been made that the  Spaniards  after the Suspension of Arms had taken several  NewEngland  and other  British  Ships gathering Salt at the Island of  Tertuga  a very full  and just Report concerning that Affair was laid before Her late Majesty of which I shall give the Reader the following Extract  'Your Majesty's Subjects have from the first Settlement of the Continent of  America  had a free Access to this Island and have without Interruptions unless in Time of War used to take what Salt they pleased there And we have Proofs of that Usage for above Years as appears by Certificates of Persons who have been employed in that Trade  'It doth not appear upon the strictest Enquiry that the  Spaniards  ever inhabited or settled on the said Island nor is it probable they ever did it being all either barren Rock or dry Sand and having no fresh Water or Provisions in it  'We take Leave to lay before Your Majesty the Consequence of Your Majesty's Subjects being prohibited to fetch Salt at  Tertuga  which will in part appear from the Number of Ships using that Trade being as we are informed one Year with another about Sail  'The Salt carried from thence to  NewEngland  is used chiefly for curing of Fish which is either  Cod    ScaleFish  or  Mackrel  The former of which is the principal Branch of the Returns made from the Continent to  Great Britain  by Way of  Spain    Portugal  and the  Straits  for the Woollen and other Goods sent from this Kingdom thither Besides which the  ScaleFish  and  Mackrel  are of such Consequence that the Sugar Islands cannot subsist without them their Negroes being chiefly supported by this Fish So that if they were not supplied therewith from  NewEngland  which they cannot be if Your Majesty's  Subjects are prohibited from getting Salt at  Tertuga  they would not be able to carry on their Sugar Works This hath been confirmed to us by several considerable Planters concerned in those Parts  'Upon the whole Your Majesty's Subjects having enjoyed an uninterrupted Usage of gathering Salt at  Tertuga  ever since the first Settlement of the Continent as aforesaid we humbly submit to Your Majesty the Consequence of preserving that Usage and Right upon which the Trade of Your Majesty's Plantations so much depends'  Notwithstanding it appears from what is abovewritten that our SugarIslands were like to suffer considerably for want of Fish from  NewEngland  no Care was taken to have this Matter remedied by the Explanatory Articles which were posterior to the above mentioned Report  However in the Third Article of the Treaty made with His present Majesty this Business is fully settled to our Advantage  The  British  Merchants having had several Hardships put upon them at  Bilboa  which occasioned the Decay of our Trade at that Place the said Merchants did make and execute in the Year a Treaty of Privileges with the Magistrates and Inhabitants of St  Ander  very much to the Advantage of this Kingdom in order to their removing and settling there The Effect of which was prevented by the Death of King  Charles  the Second of  Spain  and the War which soon after ensued This Matter it seems wa  slighted or neglected by the Managers of the  U…trecht  Treaty For by the  th  Article of tha  Treaty there is only  a Liberty given to the  Bri+  tish  Subjects to settle and dwell at St  Ander  upon the Terms of the    th  and    th  Articles of the Treaty of  which are general But no Regard was had to the forementioned Treaty of Privileges in whereas by the Second Article of the Treaty now made with His present Majesty the forementioned Treaty of Privileges with St  Ander  is confirmed and ratified  Another considerable Advantage is that the  French  by the Treaty made with His present Majesty are to pay the same Duties at the  DryPorts  through which they pass by LandCartiage as we pay upon Importation or Exportation by Sea Which was not provided for by the  Utrecht  Treaty  By the Cedula's annexed to the Treaty of the valuable Privilege of having JudgeConservators appointed to make a more speedy and les expensive Determination of all Controversies arising in Trade was fully established But by the  th  Article of  Utrecht  that Privilege was in effect given up For it is therein only stipulated  That in case any other Nation have that Privilege we shall in like Manner enjoy it  But by the  th  Article of the Treaty now made with his present Majesty it is stipulated that  We shall enjoy all the Rights Privileges Franchises Exemptions and Immunities whatsoever which we enjoyed by virtue of the Royal Cedula's or Ordinances by the Treaty of  So that hereby the Privilege of JudgeConservators is again confirmed to us  As nothing but the Reputation of His Majesty in foreign Countries and of his fixed Purposes to pursue the real Good of His Kingdoms could bring about Treaties of this Nature So 'tis impossible to reflect with Patience on the  Folly and Ingratitude of those Men who labour to disturb Him in the midst of these His Royal Cares and to misrepresent His generous Endeavours for the Good of His People  No Monday May  O Fortunatos Mercatores  Hor  SEveral Authors have written on the Advantage of Trade in general which is indeed so copious a Subject that as it is impossible to exhaust it in a short Discourse so it is very difficult to observe any thing new upon it I shall therefore only consider Trade in this Paper as it is absolutely necessary and essential to the Safety Strength and Prosperity of our own Nation  In the first Place as we are an Island accommodated on all Sides with convenient Ports and encompassed with navigable Seas we should be inexcusable if we did not make these Blessings of Providence and Advantages of Nature turn to their proper Account The most celebrated Merchants in the World and those who make the greatest Figure in Antiquity were situated in the little Island of  Tyre  which by the prodigious Increase of its Wealth and Strength at Sea did very much influence the most considerable Kingdoms and Empires on the neighbouring Continent and gave birth to the  Carthaginians  who afterwards exceeded all other Nations in Naval Power The old  Tyre  was  indeed seated on the Continent from whence the Inhabitants after having been besieged by the Great King of  Assyria  for the Space of thirteen Years withdrew themselves and their Effects into the Island of  Tyre  where by the Benefit of such a Situation a Trading People were enabled to hold out for many Ages against the Attempts of their Enemies and became the Merchants of the World  Further as an Island we are accessible on every Side and exposed to perpetual Invasions against which it is impossible to fortify ourselves sufficiently without such a Power at Sea as is not to be kept up but by a People who flourish in Commerce To which we must add that our inland Towns being destitute of Fortifications it is our indispensable Concern to preserve this our Naval Strength which is as a general Bulwark to the  British  Nation  Besides as an Island it has not been thought agreeable to the true  British  Policy to make Acquisitions upon the Continent In lieu therefore of such an Increase of Dominion it is our Business to extend to the utmost our Trade and Navigation By this means we reap the Advantages of Conquest without Violence or Injustice we not only strengthen ourselves but gain the Wealth of our Neighbours in an honest Way and without any Act of Hostility lay the several Nations of the World under a kind of Contribution  Secondly  Trade is fitted to the Nature of our Countrey as it abounds with a great Profusion of Commodities of its own Growth very convenient for other Countries and is naturally  titute of many Things suited to the Exigences Ornaments and Pleasures of Life which  may be fetched from foreign Parts But that which is more particularly to be remarked our  British  Products are of such Kinds and Quantities as can turn the Balance of Trade to our Advantage and enable us to sell more to Foreigners than we have occasion to buy from them  To this we must add that by extending a wellregulated Trade we are as great Gainers by the Commodities of many other Countries as by those of our own Nation and by supplying foreign Markets with the Growth and Manufactures of the most distant Regions we receive the same Profit from them as if they were the Produce of our own Island  Thirdly  We are not a little obliged to Trade as it has been a great Means of civilizing our Nation and banishing out of it all the Remains of its antient Barbarity There are many bitter Sayings against Islanders in general representing them as fierce treacherous and inhospitable Those who live on the Continent have such Opportunities of a frequent Intercourse with Men of different Religions and Langua+ges and who live under different Laws and Governments that they become more kind▪ benevolent and openhearted to their Fellow Creatures than those who are the Inhabitant  of an Island that hath not such Conversation  with the rest of the Species  Caesar  's Observa…tion upon our Forefathers is very much to  present Purpose who remarks That those  'em that lived upon the Coast or in Sea Port Towns were much more Civilized tha  those who had their Dwellings in the Inlan  Countrey by reason of frequent Communica+tions with their Neighbours on the Continent  In the last Place Trade is absolutely necessary for us as our Countrey is very populous It employs Multitudes of Hands both by Sea and Land and furnishes the poorest of our FellowSubjects with the Opportunities of gaining an honest Livelihood The skilful or industrious find their Account in it And many who have no fixed Property in the Soil of our Countrey can make themselves Masters of as considerable Estates as those who have the greatest Portions of the Land descending to them by Inheritance  If what has been often charged upon us by our Neighbours has any Truth in it That we are prone to Sedition and delight in Change there is no Cure more proper for this Evil than Trade which thus supplies Business to the Active and Wealth to the Indigent When Men are easy in their Circumstances they are naturally Enemies to Innovations And indeed we see in the Course of our  English  Histories many of our popular Commotions have taken their Rise from the Decay of some Branch of Commerce which created Discontents among Persons concerned in the Manufactures of the Kingdom When Men are sowred with Poverty and unemployed they easily give into any Prospect of Change which may better their Condition and cannot make it much worse  Since therefore it is manifest that the promoting of our Trade and Commerce is necessary and essential to our Security and Strength our Peace and Prosperity it is our particular Happiness to see a Monarch on the Throne who is sensible of the true Interest of his Kingdoms and applies himself with so much Success to the Advancement of our National Commerce  The Reader may see in my last Paper the Advantages which His Majesty has gained for us in our  Spanish  Trade In this I shall give a short Account of those procured for us from the  Austrain  LowCountries by Virtue of the  th  Article of the Barrier Treaty made at  Antwerp  the  th  of  November  last  This Branch of our Trade was regulated by a  Tariff  or Declaration of the Duties of Import and Export in the Year which was superseded by another made in that continued till this last  Tariff  settled in with His present Majesty As for the two former those who are at the Pains of perusing them will find the  Tariff  of laid higher Duties on several considerable Branches of our Trade than that of but in many Particulars was more favourable to us than the latter Now by the present  Tariff  of these Duties are fixed and regulated for the future by those which were most favourable in either of the former  Tariffs  And all our Products and Manufactures one only excepted which I shall name by and by settled upon rather an easier foot than ever  Our Woollen Cloths being the most profitable Branch of our Trade into these Countries have by this means gained a very considerable Advantage For the  Tariff  of having laid higher Duties upon the finer sorts and lower Duties on ordinary Cloth than what were settled in the  Tariff  of His Majesty has by the present Treaty reduced the Duties on the finer sorts to the  Tariff  of and confirmed the Duties on ordinary Cloth according to the  Tariff  of Insomuch that this present  Tariff  of  considered with relation to this valu+  able part of our Trade reduces the Duties at least one sixth Part supposing the Exportation of all sorts to be equal But as there is always a much greater Exportation of the ordinary Cloth than of the finer sorts the Reduction of these Duties becomes still much more considerable  We must farther observe that there had been several Innovations made to the Detriment of the  English  Merchant since the  Tariff  of all which Innovations are now entirely set aside upon every Species of Goods except Butter which is here particularly mentioned because we cannot be too minute and circumstantial in Accounts of this Nature This Article however is moderated and is rated in proportion to what has been and is still to be paid by the  Dutch  As our Commerce with the  Netherlands  is thus settled to the Advantage of our  British  Merchants so is it much to their Satisfaction And if His Majesty in the several succeeding Parts of his Reign which we hope may be many Years prolonged should advance our Commerce in the same Proportion as he has already done we may expect to see it in a more flourishing Condition than under any of His Royal Ancestors He seems to place his Greatness in the Riches and Prosperity of his People and what may we not hope from him in a Time of Quiet and Tranquillity Since during the late Distractions he has done so much for the Advantage of our Trade when we could not reasonably expect he should have been able to do any thing  No Friday May  Hoc fonte derivata clades  In patriam populumque fluxit  Hor  ONE would wonder how any Person endowed with the ordinary Principles of Prudence and Humanity should desire to be King of a Countrey in which the Established Religion is directly opposite to that which he himself professes Were it possible for such a one to accomplish his Designs his own Reason must tell him there could not be a more uneasy Prince not a more unhappy People But how it can enter into the Wishes of any private Persons to be the Subjects of a Man whose Faith obliges him to use the most effectual means for extirpating their Religion is altogether incomprehensible but upon the Supposition that whatever Principles they seem to adhere to their Interest Ambition or Revenge is much more active and predominant in their Minds than the Love of their Countrey or of its National Worship  I have never heard of any one particular Benefit which either the  Pretender  himself or the Favourers of his Cause could promise to the  British  Nation from the Success of his Pretensions though the Evils which would arise from it are numberless and evident These Men content themselves with one general Assertion which often appears in their Writings and in their Discourse That the Kingdom will never be Quiet till he is upon the Throne If by  this Position is meant that those will never be quiet who would endeavour to place him there it may possibly have some Truth in it tho' we hope even these will be reduced to their Obedience by the Care of their Safety if not by the Sense of their Duty But on the other side how ineffectual would this strange Expedient be for establishing the publick Quiet and Tranquillity should it ever take place for by way of Argument we may suppose Impossibilities Would that Party of Men which comprehends the most wealthy and the most valiant of the Kingdom and which were the Cause put to a Tryal would undoubtedly appear the most numerous for I am far from thinking all those who are distinguished by the Name of  Tories  to be Favourers of the  Pretender  can we I say suppose these Men would live Quiet under a Reign which they have hitherto opposed and from which they apprehend such a manifest Destruction to their Countrey Can we suppose our present Royal Family who are so powerful in foreign Dominions so strong in their Relations and Alliances and so universally supported by the Protestant Interest of  Europe  would continue Quiet and not make vigorous and repeated Attempts for the Recovery of their Right should it ever be wrested out of their Hands Can we imagine that our  British  Clergy would be Quiet under a Prince who is zealous for his Religion and obliged by it to subvert those Doctrines which it is their Duty to defend and propagate Nay would any of those Men themselves who are the Champions of this desperate Cause unless such of them as are professed RomanCatholicks or disposed to be so live Quiet under a Government which  at the best would make use of all indirect Methods in favour of a Religion that is inconsistent with our Laws and Liberties and would impose on us such a Yoke as neither We nor our Fathers were able to bear All the Quiet that could be expected from such a Reign must be the Result of absolute Power on the one Hand and a despicable Slavery on the other And I believe every reasonable Man will be of the  Roman  Historian's Opinion That a disturbed Liberty is better than a quiet Servitude  There is not indeed a greater Absurdity than to imagine the Quiet of a Nation can arise from an Establishment in which the King would be of one Communion and the People of another especially when the Religion of the Soveraign carries in it the utmost Malignity to that of the Subject If any of our  English  Monarchs might have hoped to Reign quietly under such Circumstances it would have been K  Charles  II who was received with all the Joy and Goodwill that are natural to a People newly rescu'd from a Tyranny which had long oppressed them in several Shapes But this Monarch was too wise to own himself a  Roman  Catholick even in that Juncture of Time or to imagine it practicable for an avowed Popish Prince to govern a Protestant People His Brother tryed the Experiment and every one knows the Success of it  As Speculations are best supported by Facts I shall add to these domestick Examples one or two parallel Instances out of the  Swedish  History which may be sufficient to shew us that a Scheme of Government is impracticable in which the Head does not agree with the Body in that Point which is of the greatest Concern to reasonable  Creatures  Sweden  is the only Protestant Kingdom in  Europe  besides this of  Great Britain  which has had the Misfortune to see Popish Princes upon the Throne and we find that they behaved themselves as we did and as it is natural for Men to do upon the same Occasion Their King  Sigismond  having contrary to the Inclinations of his People endeavour'd by several clandestine Methods to promote the  Roman  Catholick Religion among his Subjects and shewn several Marks of Favour to their Priests and Jesuits was after a very short Reign deposed by the States of that Kingdom being represented as one who could neither be held by Oaths nor Promises and overruled by the Influence of his Religion which dispenses with the Violation of the most sacred Engagements that are opposite to its Interests The States to shew farther their Apprehensions of Popery and how incompatible they thought the Principles of the Church of  Rome  in a Soveraign were with those of the Reform'd Religion in his Subjects agreed that his Son should succeed to the Throne provided he were brought up a Protestant This the Father seemingly complyed with but afterwards refusing to give him such an Education the Son was likewise set aside and for ever excluded from that Succession The famous Queen  Christina  Daughter to the Great  Gustavus  was so sensible of those Troubles which would accrue both to her self and her People should she avow the Roman Catholick Religion while she was upon the Throne of  Sweden  that she did not make an open Profession of that Faith till she had resigned her Crown and was actually upon her Journey to  Rome  In short if there be any political Maxim which may be depended upon as sure and infallible this is one that it is impossible for a Nation to be happy where a People of the Reformed Religion are govern'd by a King that is a Papist Were he indeed only a nominal  Roman  Catholick there might be a possibility of Peace and Quiet under such a Reign but if he is sincere in the Principles of his Church he must treat Heretical Subjects as that Church directs him and knows very well that he ceases to be Religious when he ceases to be a Persecutor  No Monday May

Oats out of his Pocket and with a great deal of Pleasure gathering the Ducks about him Upon my coming up to him who should it be but my Friend the Foxhunter whom I gave  some Account of in my  d  Paper I immediately joined him and partook of his Diversion till he had not an Oat left in his Pocket We then made the Tour of the Park together when after having entertained me with the Description of a DecoyPond that lay near his Seat in the Countrey and of a Meeting House that was going to be rebuilt in a neighbouring MarketTown he gave me an Account of some very odd Adventures which he had met with that Morning and which I shall lay together in a short and faithful History as well as my Memory will give me Leave  My Friend who has a natural Aversion to  London  would never have come up had not he been subpaena'd to it as he told me in order to give his Testimony for one of the Rebels whom he knew to be a very fair Sportsman Having travelled all Night to avoid the Inconveniencies of Dust and Heat he arrived with his Guide a little after break of Day at  CharingCross  where to his great Surprize he saw a running Footman carried in a Chair followed by a Waterman in the same kind of Vehicle He was wondering at the Extravagance of their Masters that furnished them with such Dresses and Accommodations when on a sudden he beheld a ChimneySweeper convey'd after the same manner with three Footmen running before him During his Progress through the  Strand  he met with several other Figures no less wonderful and surprizing Seeing a great many in rich MorningGowns he was amazed to find that Persons of Quality were up so early And was no less astonished to see many Lawyers in their BarGowns when he knew by his Almanack the Term was ended As he was extremely  puzzled and confounded in himself what all this should mean a HackneyCoach chancing to pass by him Four  Batts  popp'd out their Heads all at once which very much frighted both him and his Horse My Friend who always takes Care to cure his Horse of such starting Fits spurred him up to the very side of the Coach to the no small Diversion of the  Batts  who seeing him with his long Whip Horsehair Perriwig Jockey Belt and Coat without Sleeves fancied him to be one of the Masqueraders on Horseback and received him with a loud Peal of Laughter His Mind being full of idle Stories which are spread up and down the Nation by the Disaffected he immediately concluded that all the Persons he saw in these strange Habits were Foreigners and conceived a great Indignation against them for pretending to laugh at an  English  CountreyGentleman But he soon recovered out of his Error by hearing the Voices of several of them and particularly of a Shepherdess quarrelling with her Coachman and threatning to break his Bones in very intelligible  English  though with a masculine Tone His Astonishment still increased upon him to see a continued Procession of Harlequins Searamouches Punchinello's and a thousand other merry Dresses by which People of Quality distinguish their Wit from that of the Vulgar  Being now advanced as far as  SomersetHouse  and observing it to be the great Hive whence this Swarm of Chimeras issued forth from Time to Time my Friend took his Station among a Cluster of Mob who were making themselves merry with their Betters The first that came out was a very venerable Matron with a Nose and Chin that were within a very littl  of  touching one another My Friend at the first View fancying her to be an old Woman of Quality out of his good breeding put off his Hat to her when the Person pulling off her Masque to his great Surprize appear'd a Smockfaced young Fellow His Attention was soon taken off from this Object and turned to another that had very hollow Eyes and a wrinkled Face which flourished in all the Bloom of Fifteen The Whiteness of the Lilly was blended in it with the Blush of the Rose He mistook it for a very whimsical kind of Masque but upon a nearer View he found that she held her Vizard in her Hand and that what he saw was only her natural Countenance touched up with the usual Improvements of an aged Coquette  The next who shew'd her self was a Female Quaker so very pretty that he could not forbear licking his Lips and saying to the Mob about him  'Tis ten thousand Pities she is not a ChurchWoman  The Quaker was followed by half a dozen Nuns who filed off one after another up  Catherinestreet  to their respective Convents in  Drurylane  The 'Squire observing the Preciseness of their Dress began now to imagine after all that this was a Nest of Sectaries for he had often heard that the Town was full of them He was confirmed in this Opinion upon seeing a Conjurer whom he guess'd to be the Holderforth However to satisfie himself he asked a Porter who stood next him What Religion these People were of The Porter reply'd  They are of no Religion 'tis a Masquerade  Upon that says my Friend I began to smoak that they were a Parcel of Mummers and being himself one of the Quorum in his own County  could not but wonder that none of the  Middlesex  Justices took Care to lay some of them by the Heels He was the more provoked in the Spirit of Magistracy upon discovering two very unseemly Objects The first was a Judge who rapp'd out a great Oath at his Footman and the other a big belly'd Woman who upon taking a Leap into the Coach miscarry'd of a Cushion What still gave him greater Offence was a drunken Bishop who reeled from one side of the Court to the other and was very sweet upon an  Indian  Queen But his Worship in the midst of his Austerity was mollify'd at the Sight of a very lovely Milkmaid whom he began to regard with an Eye of Mercy and conceived a particular Affection for her 'till he found to his great Amazement that the Standers by suspected her to be a Dutchess  I must not conclude this Narrative without mentioning one Disaster which happened to my Friend on this Occasion Having for his better Convenience dismounted and mixed among the Crowd he found upon his Arrival at the Inn that he had lost his Purse and his Almanack And though 'tis no Wonder such a Trick should be played him by some of the curious Spectators he cannot beat it out of his Head but that it was a Cardinal who picked his Pocket and that this Cardinal was a Presbyterian in Disguise  No Friday May  Nimium Risus pretium est si Probitatis impendio constat  Quintil  I Have lately read with much Pleasure the Essays upon several Subjects published by Sir  Richard Blackmore  and though I agree with him in many of his excellent Observations I cannot but take that reasonable Freedom which he himself makes use of with regard to other Writers to dissent from him in some few particulars In his Reflections upon Works of Wit and Humour he observes how unequal they are to combat Vice and Folly and seems to think that the finest Raillery and Satyr though directed by these generous Views never reclaimed one vicious Man or made one Fool depart from his Folly  This is a Position very hard to be contradicted because no Author knows the Number or Names of his Converts As for the  Tatlers  and  Spectators  in particular which are obliged to this ingenious and useful Author for the Character he has given of them they were so generally dispersed in single Sheets and have since been printed in so great Numbers that it is to be hoped they have made some Proselytes to the Interests if not to the Practice of Wisdom and Virtue among such a Multitude of Readers  I need not remind this learned Gentleman that  Socrates  who was the greatest Propagator of Morality in the Heathen World and a Martyr  for the Unity of the Godhead was so famous for the Exercise of this Talent among the politest People of Antiquity that he gained the Name of    the Drole  There are very good Effects which visibly arose from the abovementioned Performances and others of the like Nature as in the first Place they diverted Raillery from improper Objects and gave a new Turn to Ridicule which for many Years had been exerted on Persons and Things of a sacred and serious Nature They endeavoured to make Mirth instructive and if they failed in this great End they must be allowed at least to have made it Innocent If Wit and Humour begin again to relapse into their former Licentiousness they can never hope for Approbation from those who know that Raillery is Useless when it has no Moral under it and Pernicious when it attacks any thing that is either unblameable or praiseworthy To this we may add what has been commonly observed that it is not difficult to be merry on the side of Vice as serious Objects are the most capable of Ridicule as the Party which naturally favour such a Mirth is the most numerous and as there are the most standing Jests and Patterns for Imitation in this kind of Writing  In the next Place Such Productions of Wit and Humour as have a Tendency to expose Vice and Folly furnish useful Diversions to all kinds of Readers The good or prudent Man may by these Means be diverted without Prejudice to his Discretion or Morality Raillery under such Regulations unbends the Mind from serious Studies and severer Contemplations without throwing it off from its proper  Byass It carries on the same Design that is promoted by Authors of a graver Turn and only does it in another manner It also awakens Reflection in those who are the most indifferent in the Cause of Virtue or Knowlege by setting before them the Absurdity of such Practices as are generally unobserved by reason of their being Common or Fashionable Nay it sometimes catches the Dissolute and Abandoned before they are aware of it who are often betrayed to laugh at themselves and upon Reflection find that they are merry at their own Expence I might farther take Notice that by Entertainments of this Kind a Man may be cheerful in Solitude and not be forced to seek for Company every Time he has a Mind to be merry  The last Advantage I shall mention from Compositions of this Nature when thus restrained is that they shew Wisdom and Virtue are far from being inconsistent with Politeness and good Humour They make Morality appear amiable to People of gay Dispositions and refute the common Objection against Religion which represents it as only fit for gloomy and melancholy Tempers It was the Motto of a Bishop very eminent for his Piety and good Works in King  Charles  the Second's Reign  Inservi Deo et Laetare    Serve God and be cheerful  Those therefore who supply the World with such Entertainments of Mirth as are instructive or at least harmless may be thought to deserve well of Mankind to which I shall only add that they retrieve the Honour of polite Learning and answer those sower Enthusiasts who affect to stigmatize the sinest and most elegant Authors both ancient  and modern which they have never read as dangerous to Religion and destructive of all sound and saving Knowledge  Our Nation are such Lovers of Mirth and Humour that it is impossible for detached Papers which come out on stated Days either to have a general Run or long Continuance if they are not diversify'd and enlivened from Time to Time with Subjects and Thoughts accommodated to this Taste which so prevails among our Countreymen No Periodical Author who always maintains his Gravity and does not sometimes sacrifice to the Graces must expect to keep in vogue for any considerable Time Political Speculations in particular however Just and Important are of so dry and austere a Nature that they will not go down with the Publick without frequent Seasonings of this Kind The Work may be well performed but will never take if it is not set off with proper Scenes and Decorations A mere Politician is but a dull Companion and if he is always wise is in great Danger of being tiresome or ridiculous  Besides Papers of Entertainment are necessary to increase the Number of Readers especially among those of different Notions and Principles who by this Means may be betray'd to give you a fair Hearing and to know what you have to say for your self I might likewise observe that in all political Writings there is something that grates upon the Mind of the most candid Reader in Opinions which are not conformable to his own Way of thinking and that the Harshness of Reasoning is not a little softned and smoothed by the Infusions of Mirth and Pleasantry  Political Speculations do likewise furnish us with several Objects that may very innocently be ridiculed and which are regarded as such by Men of Sense in all Parties of this Kind are the Passions of our Stateswomen and the Reasonings of our Foxhunters  A Writer who makes Fame the chief End of his Endeavours and would be more desirous of pleasing than of improving his Readers might find an inexhaustible Fund of Mirth in Politicks Scandal and Satyr are neverfailing Gratifications to the Publick Detraction and Obloquy are received with as much Eagerness as Wit and Humour Should a Writer single out particular Persons or point his Raillery at any Order of Men who by their Profession ought to be exempt from it should be slander the Innocent or satyrize the Miserable or should he even on the proper Subjects of Derision give the full Play to his Mirth without regard to Decency and good Manners he might be sure of pleasing a great Part of his Readers but must be a very ill Man if by such a Proceeding he could please himself  No Monday May  male nominatis  Parcite verbis  Hic dies vere mihi festus atras  Eximet curas ego nec tumultum  Nec mori per vim metuam tenente  Caesare terras  Hor  THE usual Salutation to a Man upon his Birth day among the ancient  Romans  was  Multos et Foe  ices  in which they wished him many happy Returns of it When  Augustus  celebrated the Secular Year which was kept but once in a Century and received the Congratulations of his People on that Account an eminent CourtWit saluted him in the Birth day Form  Multos et Foe  ices  which is recorded as a beautiful Turn or Compliment expressing a Desire that he might enjoy a happy Life of many Hundreds of Years This Salutation cannot be taxed with Flattery since it was directed to a Prince of whom it is said by a great Historian  It had been happy for  Rome  if he had never been  he had never died  Had he never been born  Rome  would in all Probability have recovered its former Liberty Had he never died it would have been more happy under his Government than it could have been in the Possession of its ancient Freedom  It is our good Fortune that our Soveraign whose Nativity is celebrated on this Day  gives us a Prospect which the  Romans  wanted under the Reign of their  Augustus  of his being succeeded by an Heir both to his Virtues and his Dominions In the mean Time it happens very luckily for the Establishment of a new Race of Kings upon the  British  Throne that the first of this Royal Line has all those high Qualifications which are necessary to fix the Crown upon his own Head and to transmit it to his Posterity We may indeed observe that every Series of Kings who have kept up the Succession in their respective Families in spite of all Pretensions and Oppositions formed against them has been headed by Princes famous for Valour and Wisdom I need only mention the Names of  William the Conqueror    Henry  II  Henry  IV  Edward  IV and  Henry  VII As for King  James  I the Founder of the  Stuart  Race had he been as well turned for the Camp as the Cabinet and not confined all his Views to the Peace and Tranquillity of his own Reign his Son had not been involved in such fatal Troubles and Confusions  Were an honest  Briton  to wish for a Soveraign who in the present Situation of Affairs would be most capable of advancing our national Happiness what could he desire more than a Prince mature in Wisdom and Experience renowned for his Valour and Resolution successful and fortunate in his Undertakings zealous for the Reformed Religion related or allied to all the most considerable Protestant Powers of  Europe  and blest with a numerous Issue A Failure in any one of these Particulars has been the Cause of infinite Calamities to the  British  Nation but when they all thus happily concur in the same Person they are as much as can be suggested even by  our Wishes for making us a happy People so far as the Qualifications of a Monarch can contribute to it  I shall not attempt a Character of his present Majesty having already given an imperfect Sketch of it in my second Paper but shall chuse rather to observe that cruel Treatment which this excellent Prince has met with from the Tongues and Pens of some of his disaffected Subjects The Baseness Ingratitude and Injustice of which Practice will appear to us if we consider  First that it reflects highly upon the good Sense of the  British  Nation who do not know how to set a just Value upon a Prince whose Virtues have gained him the universal Esteem of foreign Countries Those Potentates who as some may suppose do not wish well to his Affairs have shewn the greatest Respect to his personal Character and testified their Readiness to enter into such Friendships and Alliances as may be advantageous to his People The Northern Kings solicite him with Impatience to come among them as the only Person capable of settling the several Claims and Pretensions which have produced such unspeakable Calamities in that Part of the World Two of the most remote and formidable Powers of  Europe  have entertained Thoughts of submitting their Disputes to his Arbitration Every one knows His ancient Subjects had such a long Experience of his Soveraign Virtues that at his Departure from them his whole People were in Tears which were answered with all those Sentiments of Humanity that arise in the Heart of a good Prince on so moving an Occasion What a Figure therefore must we make among  Mankind if we are the only People of  Europe  who derogate from his Merit that may be made happy by it and if in a Kingdom which is grown glorious by the Reputation of such a Soveraign there are Multitudes who would endeavour to lessen and undervalue it  In the next Place such a Treatment from any part of our FellowSubjects is by no means answerable to what we receive from His Majesty His Love and Regard for our Constitution is so remarkable that as we are told by those whose Office it is to lay the Business of the Nation before him it is his first Question upon any Matter of the least Doubt or Difficulty whether it be in every Point according to the Laws of the Land He is easy of Access to those who desire it and is so gracious in his Behaviour and Condescension on such Occasions that none of his Subjects retire from his Presence without the greatest Idea of his Wisdom and Goodness His continued Application to such publick Affairs as may conduce to the Benefit of his Kingdoms diverts him from those Pleasures and Entertainments which may be indulged by Persons in a lower Station and are pursued with Eagerness by Princes who have not the Care of the Publick so much at Heart The least Return which we can make to such a Soveraign is that Tribute which is always paid by honest Men and is always acceptable to great Minds the Praise and Approbation that are due to a virtuous and noble Character Common Decency forbids opprobrious Language even to a bad Prince and common Justice will exact from us towards a good Prince the same Benevolence and Humanity with which he treats his Subjects Those who are influenced  by Duty and Gratitude will rise much higher in all the Expressions of Affection and Respect and think they can never do too much to advance the Glory of a Soveraign who takes so much Pains to advance their Happiness  When we have a King who has gain'd the Reputation of the most unblemish'd Probity and Honour and has been fam'd through the whole Course of his Life for an inviolable Adherence to his Promises we may acquiesce after his many solemn Declarations in all those Measures which it is impossible for us to judge rightly of unless we were let into such Schemes of Council and Intelligence as produce them and therefore we should rather turn our Thoughts upon the Reasonableness of his Proceedings than busy our selves to form Objections against them The Consideration of His Majesty'd Character should at all Times suppress our Censure of his Conduct And since we have never yet seen or heard of any false Steps in his Behaviour we ought in Justice to think that he governs himself by his usual Rules of Wisdom and Honour 'till we discover something to the contrary  These Considerations ought to reconcile to His Majesty the Hearts and Tongues of all His People But as for those who are the obstinate irreclaimable professed Enemies to our present Establishment we must expect their Calumnies will not only continue but rise against him in proportion as he pursues such Measures as are likely to prove successful and ought to recommend him to his People  No Friday June  cessit furor et rabida ora quierunt  Virg  I Question not but most of my Readers will be very well pleased to hear that my Friend the Foxhunter of whose Arrival in Town I gave Notice in my  th  Paper is become a Convert to the present Establishment and a good Subject to King  GEORGE  The Motives to his Conversion shall be the Subject of this Paper as they may be of use to other Persons who labour under those Prejudices and Prepossessions which hung so long upon the Mind of my worthy Friend These I had an Opportunity of learning the other Day when at his Request we took a Ramble together to see the Curiosities of this great Town  The first Circumstance as he ingenuously confessed to me while we were in the Coach together which helped to disabuse him was seeing King  Charles  I on Horseback at  CharingCross  for he was sure that Prince could never have kept his Seat there had the Stories been true he had heard in the Countrey that  Forty One  was come about again  He owned to me that he looked with Horror on the new Church that is half built in the  Strand  as taking it at first sight to be half demolished But upon enquiring of the Workmen was agreeably surprized to find that instead of pulling it down they were building it  up and that Fifty more were raising in other Parts of the Town  To these I must add a third Circumstance which I find had no small Share in my Friend's Conversion Since his coming to Town he chanced to look into the Church of St  Paul  about the middle of Sermontime where having first examined the Dome to see if it stood safe for the ScrewPlot still ran in his Head he observed that the LordMayor Aldermen and City Sword were a part of the Congregation This Sight had the more Weight with him as by good Luck not above two of that Venerable Body were fallen asleep  This Discourse held us till we came to the Tower for our first Visit was to the Lions My Friend who had a great deal of Talk with their Keeper enquired very much after their Health and whether none of them had fallen sick upon the taking of  Perth  and the Flight of the  Pretender  and hearing they were never better in their Lives I found he was extremely startled For he had learned from his Cradle that the Lions in the Tower were the best Judges of the Title of our  British  Kings and always sympathized with our Soveraigns  After having here satiated our Curiosity we repaired to the  Monument  where my FellowTraveller being a wellbreathed Man mounted the Ascent with much Speed and Activity I was forced to halt so often in this perpendicular March that upon my joining him on the Top of the Pillar I found he had counted all the Steeples and Towers which were discernible from this advantageous Situation and was endeavouring to compute the Number of Acres  they stood upon We were both of us very well pleased with this part of the Prospect but I found he cast an evil Eye upon several Warehouses and other Buildings that looked like Barns and seemed capable of receiving great Multitudes of People His Heart misgave him that these were so many MeetingHouses but upon communicating his Suspicions to me I soon made him easy in this particular  We then turned our Eyes upon the River which gave me an Occasion to inspire him with some favourable Thoughts of Trade and Merchandize that had fill'd the  Thames  with such Crowds of Ships and covered the Shore with such Swarms of People  We descended very leisurely my Friend being careful to count the Steps which he register'd in a blank Leaf of his new Almanack Upon our coming to the bottom observing an  English  Inscription upon the Basis he read it over several Times and told me he could scarce believe his own Eyes for that he had often heard from an old Attorney who lived near him in the Countrey that it was the Presbyterians who burned down the City whereas says he this Pillar positively affirms in so many Words that  the burning of this ancient City was begun and carried on by the Treachery and Malice of the Popish Faction in order to the carrying on their horrid Plot for extirpating the Protestant Religion and old  English  Liberty and introducing Popery and Slavery  This Account which he looked upon to be more authentick than if it had been in Print I found made a very great Impression upon him  We now took Coach again and made the best of our Way for the  Royal Exchange  though I  found he did not much care to venture himself into the Throng of that Place for he told me he had heard they were generally speaking Republicans and was afraid of having his Pocket pick'd amongst them But he soon conceived a better Opinion of them when he spied the Statue of King  Charles  II standing up in the middle of the Crowd and most of the Kings in  Baker  's Chronicle ranged in order over their Heads from whence he very justly concluded that an Antimonarchical Assembly could never chuse such a Place to meet in once a Day  To continue this good Disposition in my Friend after a short stay at  Stocks Market  we drove away directly for the  Meuse  where he was not a little edified with the Sight of those fine Sets of Horses which have been brought over from  Hanover  and with the Care that is taken of them He made many good Remarks upon this Occasion and was so pleased with his Company that I had much ado to get him out of the Stable  In our Progress to St  James  's  Park  for that was the end of our Journey he took Notice with great Satisfaction that contrary to his Intelligence in the Countrey the Shops were all open and full of Business that the Soldiers walked civilly in the Streets that Clergymen instead of being affronted had generally the Wall given them and that he had heard the Bells ring to Prayers from Morning to Night in some Part of the Town or another  As he was full of these honest Reflections it happened very luckily for us that one of the King's Coaches passed by with the three young Princesses in it whom by an accidental Stop we had an Opportunity of surveying for some  Time My Friend was ravished with the Beauty Innocence and Sweetness that appeared in all their Faces He declared several Times that they were the finest Children he had ever seen in all his Life and assured me that before this Sight if any one had told him it had been possible for three such pretty Children to have been born out of  England  he should never have believed them  We were now walking together in the Park and as it is usual for Men who are naturally warm and heady to be transported with the greatest Flush of Goodnature when they are once sweetened he owned to me very frankly he had been much imposed upon by those false Accounts of things he had heard in the Countrey and that he would make it his Business upon his Return thither to set his Neighbours right and give them a more just Notion of the present State of Affairs  What confirm'd my Friend in this excellent Temper of Mind and gave him an inexpressible Satisfaction was a Message he received as we were walking together from the Prisoner for whom he had given his Testimony in his late Tryal This Person having been condemned for his Part in the late Rebellion sent him word that His Majesty had been graciously pleased to Reprieve him with several of his Friends in order as it was thought to give them their Lives and that he hoped before he went out of Town they should have a cheerful Meeting and drink Health and Prosperity to King  George  No Monday June  Tu tamen si habes aliquam spem de Republica sive desperas ea para meditare cogita quae esse in eo cive ac viro debent qui sit Rempublicam afflictam et oppressam miseris temporibus ac perditis moribus in veterem dignitatem ac libertatem vindicaturus  Cicer  THE Condition of a Minister of State is only suited to Persons who out of a Love to their King and Countrey desire rather to be useful to the Publick than easy to themselves When a Man is posted in such a Station whatever his Behaviour may be he is sure beside the natural Fatigue and Trouble of it to incur the Envy of some and the Displeasure of others as he will have many Rivals whose Ambition he cannot satisfy and many Dependents whose Wants he cannot provide for These are Misfortunes inseparable from such publick Employments in all Countries but there are several others which hang upon this Condition of Life in our  British  Government more than any other Soveraignty in  Europe  As in the first Place there is no other Nation which is so equally divided into two opposite Parties whom it is impossible to please at the same Time Our Notions of the publick Good with relation both to our selves and Foreigners are of so different a Nature that those Measures which are extolled by one half of the Kingdom are naturally decryed by the other Besides that in a  British  Administration many Acts of Government are  absolutely necessary in which one of the Parties must be favoured and obliged in opposition to their Antagonists So that the most perfect Administration conducted by the most consummate Wisdom and Probity must unavoidably produce Opposition Enmity and Defamation from Multitudes who are made happy by it  Farther It is peculiarly observed of our Nation that almost every Man in it is a Politician and hath a Scheme of his own which he thinks preferable to that of any other Person Whether this may proceed from that Spirit of Liberty which reigns among us or from those great Numbers of all Ranks and Conditions who from Time to Time are concerned in the  British  Legislature and by that Means are let into the Business of the Nation I shall not take upon me to determine But for this Reason it is certain that a  British  Ministry must expect to meet with many Censurers even in their own Party and ought to be satisfied if allowing to every particular Man that his private Scheme is wisest they can persuade him that next to his own Plan that of the Government is the most eligible  Besides We have a Set of very honest and wellmeaning Gentlemen in  England  not to be met with in other Countries who take it for granted they can never be in the wrong so long as they oppose Ministers of State Those whom they have admired through the whole Course of their Lives for their Honour and Integrity though they still persist to act in their former Character and change nothing but their Stations appear to them in a disadvantageous Light as soon as they are placed upon StateEminences Many of these Gentlemen have been used to think there is a kind of Slavery in concurring with  the Measures of Great Men and that the Good of the Countrey is inconsistent with the Inclinations of the Court By the Strength of these Prejudices they are apt to fancy a Man loses his Honesty from the very Moment that it is made the most capable of being useful to the Publick and will not consider that it is every whit as honourable to assist a good Minister as to oppose a bad one  In the last Place We may observe that there are greater Numbers of Persons who solicit for Places and perhaps are fit for them in our own Countrey than in any other To which we must add That by the Nature of our Constitution it is in the Power of more particular Persons in this Kingdom than in any other to distress the Government when they are disobliged A  British  Minister must therefore expect to see many of those Friends and Dependents fall off from him whom he cannot gratify in their Demands upon him since to use the Phrase of a late Statesman who knew very well how to form a Party  The Pasture is not large enough  Upon the Whole The Condition of a  British  Minister labours under so many Difficulties that we find in almost every Reign since the Conquest the chief Ministers have been New Men or such as have raised themselves to the greatest Posts in the Government from the State of private Gentlemen Several of them neither rose from any Conspicuous Family nor left any behind them being of that Class of eminent Persons whom Sir  Francis Bacon  speaks of who like Comets or blazing Stars draw upon them the whole Attention of the Age in which they appear though no Body knows whence they came not where they are lost Persons of Hereditary  Wealth and Title have not been over forward to engage in so great a Scene of Cares and Perplexities nor to run all the Risques of so dangerous a Situation Nay many whose Greatness and Fortune were not made to their Hands and had sufficient Qualifications and Opportunities of rising to these high Posts of Trust and Honour have been deterred from such Pursuits by the Difficulties that attend them and chose rather to be Easie than Powerful or if I may use the Expression to be Carried in the Chariot than to Drive it  As the Condition of a Minister of State in general is subject to many Burthens and Vexations and as that of a  British  Minister in particular is involved in several Hazards and Difficulties peculiar to our own Countrey so is this high Station exposed more than ordinary to such Inconveniencies in the present Juncture of Affairs first as it is the beginning of a new Establishment among us and secondly as this Establishment hath been disturbed by a dangerous Rebellion  If we look back into our  English  History we shall always find the first Monarch of a new Line received with the greatest Opposition and reconciling to himself by Degrees the Duty and Affection of his People The Government on such Occasions is always shaken before it settles The Inveteracy of the Peoples Prejudices and the Artifices of domestick Enemies compelled their Rulers to make use of all Means for reducing them to their Allegiance which perhaps after all was brought about rather by Time than by Policy When Commotions and Disturbances are of an extraordinary and unusual Nature the Proceedings of the Government must be so  too The Remedy must be suited to the Evil and I know no Juncture more difficult to a Minister of State than such as requires uncommon Methods to be made use of when at the same Time no others can be made use of than what are prescribed by the known Laws of our Constitution Several Measures may be absolutely necessary in such a Juncture which may be represented as hard and severe and would not be proper in a Time of publick Peace and Tranquillity In this Case  Virgil  's Excuse which he puts in the Mouth of a fictitious Sovereign upon a Complaint of this Nature hath the utmost force of Reason and Justice on its Side  Res dura et regni Novitas me talia cogunt  The Difficulties I meet with in the beginning of my Reign make such a Proceeding necessary  In the next Place As this Establishment has been disturbed by a dangerous Rebellion the Ministry has been involved in many additional and supernumerary Difficulties It is a common Remark that  English  Ministers never fare so well as in a Time of War with a foreign Power which diverts the private Feuds and Animosities of the Nation and turns their Efforts upon the common Enemy As a foreign War is favourable to a Ministry a Rebellion is no less dangerous if it succeeds they are the first Persons who must fall a Sacrifice to it if it is defeated they naturally become odious to all the secret Favourers and Abettors of it Every Method they make use of for preventing or suppressing it and for deterring others from the like Practices for the future must be unacceptable and displeasing  to the Friends Relations and Accomplices of the Guilty In Cases where it is thought necessary to make Examples it is the Humour of the Multitude to forget the Crime and remember the Punishment However we have already seen and still hope to see so many Instances of Mercy in his Majesty's Government that our chief Ministers have more to fear from the Murmurs of their too violent Friends than from the Reproaches of their Enemies  No Friday June  jam nunc sollennes ducere pompas  Ad delubra juvat  Virg  YEsterday was set apart as a Day of Publick Thanksgiving for the late extraordinary Successes which have secured to us every Thing that can be esteemed and delivered us from every Thing that can be apprehended by a Protestant and a Free People I cannot but observe upon this Occasion the natural Tendency in such a National Devotion to inspire Men with Sentiments of religious Gratitude and to swell their Hearts with inward Transports of Joy and Exultation  When Instances of Divine Favour are great in themselves when they are fresh upon the Memory when they are peculiar to a certain Countrey and commemorated by them in large and solemn Assemblies A Man must be of a very cold or degenerate Temper whose Heart doth not burn within him in the midst of that Praise  and Adoration which arises at the same Hour in all the different Parts of the Nation and from the many Thousands of the People  It is impossible to read of Extraordinary and National Acts of Worship without being warmed with the Description and feeling some Degree of that Divine Enthusiasm which spreads it self among a joyful and religious Multitude A Part of that exuberant Devotion with which the whole Assembly raised and animated one another catches a Reader at the greatest Distance of Time and makes him a kind of Sharer in it  Among all the publick Solemnities of this Nature there is none in History so glorious as that under the Reign of King  Solomon  at the Dedication of the Temple Besides the great Officers of State and the Inhabitants of  Jerusalem  all the Elders and Heads of Tribes with the whole Body of the People ranged under them from one end of the Kingdom to the other were summoned to assist in it We may guess at the prodigious Number of this Assembly from the Sacrifice on which they feasted consisting of a Hundred and Twenty Thousand Sheep and Two Hundred and Twenty Hecatombs of Oxen When this vast Congregation was formed into a regular Procession to attend the Ark of the Covenant the King marched at the Head of his People with Hymns and Dances to the new Temple which he had erected for its Reception  Josephus  tells us that the  Levites  sprinkled the Way as they passed with the Blood of Sacrifices and burned the holy Incense in such Quantities as refreshed the whole Multitude with its Odours and filled all the Region about them with Perfume When the Ark was deposited  under the Wings of the Cherubims in the holy Place the great Consort of Praise began It was enlivened with a Hundred and Twenty Trumpets assisted with a proportionable Number of other kinds of musical Instruments and accompanied with innumerable Voices of all the Singers of  Israel  who were instructed and set apart to religious Performances of this kind As this mighty Chorus was extolling their Maker and exciting the whole Nation thus assembled to the Praise of his neverceasing Goodness and Mercy the  Shekinah  descended Or to tell it in the more emphatical Words of holy Writ  It came to pass as the Trumpets and Singers were as one to make one Sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord and when they lift up their Voice with the Trumpets and Cymbals and Instruments of Musick and praised the Lord saying  For he is good for his Mercy endureth for ever  that then the House was filled with a Cloud  The Priests themselves not able to bear the Awfulness of the Appearance retired into the Court of the Temple where the King being placed upon a brazen Scaffold so as to be seen by the whole Multitude blessed the Congregation of  Israel  and afterwards spreading forth his Hands to Heaven offered up that Divine Prayer which is twice recorded at length in Scripture and has always been looked upon as a Composition fit to have proceeded from the wisest of Men He had no sooner finished his Prayer when a Flash of Fire fell from Heaven and burned up the Sacrifice which lay ready upon the Altar The People whose Hearts were gradually moved by the Solemnity of the whole Proceeding having been exalted by the religious Strains of Musick and aw'd by the Appearance of that  Glory which filled the Temple seeing now the miraculous Consumption of the Sacrifice and observing the Piety of their King who lay prostrate before his Maker  bowed themselves with their Faces to the Ground upon the Pavement and worshipped and praised the Lord saying  For he is good for his Mercy endureth for ever  What Happiness might not such a Kingdom promise to itself where the same elevated Spirit of Religion ran through the Prince the Priests and the People But I shall quit this Head to observe that such an uncommon Fervour of Devotion shewed itself among our own Countreymen and in the Persons of three Princes who were the greatest Conquerors in our  English  History These are  Edward  the Third his Son the  Black Prince  and  Henry  the Fifth As for the first we are told that before the famous Battel of  Cressy  he spent the greatest Part of the Night in Prayer and in the Morning received the Sacrament with his Son the chief of his Officers and Nobility The Night of that glorious Day was no less piously distinguished by the Orders which he gave out to his Army that they should forbear all insulting of their Enemies or boasting of their own Valour and employ their Time in returning Thanks to the great Giver of the Victory The  Black Prince  before the Battel of  Poictiers  declared that his whole Confidence was in the Divine Assistance and after that great Victory behaved himself in all Particulars like a truly Christian Conqueror Eight Days successively were appointed by his Father in  England  for a Solemn and Publick Thanksgiving and when the young Prince returned in Triumph with a King of  France  as his Prisoner the Pomp of the Day consisted chiefly  in extraordinary Processions and Acts of Devotion The Behaviour of the  Black Prince  after a Battel in  Spain  whereby he restored the King of  Castile  to his Dominions was no less remarkable When that King transported with his Success flung himself upon his Knees to thank him the generous Prince ran to him and taking him by the Hand told him it was not He who could lay any Claim to his Gratitude but desired they might go to the Altar together and jointly return their Thanks to whom only it was due  Henry  V who at the Beginning of his Reign made a publick Prayer in the Presence of his Lords and Commons that he might be cut off by an immediate Death if Providence foresaw he would not prove a just and good Governor and promote the Welfare of his People manifestly derived his Courage from his Piety and was scrupulously careful not to ascribe the Success of it to himself When he came within Sight of that prodigious Army which offered him Battel at  Agincourt  he ordered all his Cavalry to dismount and with the rest of his Forces to implore upon their Knees a Blessing on their Undertaking In a noble Speech which he made to his Soldiers immediately before the first Onset he took Notice of a very remarkable Circumstance namely that this very Day of Battel was the Day appointed in his own Kingdom to offer up publick Devotions for the Prosperity of his Arms and therefore bid them not doubt of Victory since at the same Time that they were fighting in the Field all the People of  England  were lifting up their Hands to Heaven for their Success Upon the close of that memorable Day in which the King had performed  Wonders wirh his own Hand he ordered the CXV  th  Psalm to be repeated in the midst of his victorious Army and at the Words  Not unto us not unto us but unto thy Name be the Praise  He himself with his whole Host fell to the Earth upon their Faces ascribing to Omnipotence the whole Glory of so great an Action  I shall conclude this Paper with a Reflection which naturally rises out of it As there is nothing more beautiful in the Sight of God and Man than a King and his People concurring in such extraordinary Acts of Devotion one cannot suppose a greater Contradiction and Absurdity in a Government than where the King is of one Religion and the People of another What Harmony or Correspondence can be expected between a Soveraign and his Subjects when they cannot join together in the most joyful the most solemn and most laudable Action of reasonable Creatures in a word where the Prince considers his People as Hereticks and the People look upon their Prince as an Idolater  No Monday June  O quisquis volet impias  Caedes et rabiem tollere civicam  Si quaeret pater urbium  Subscribi statuis indomitam audeat  R  are licentiam  Clarus posigenitis  Hor  WHEN  Mahomet  had for many Years endeavoured to propagate his Imposture among  his FellowCitizens and instead of gaining any Number of Proselytes found his Ambition frustrated and his Notions ridiculed he forbad his Followers the Use of Argument and Disputation in the advancing of his Doctrines and to rely only upon the Scimeter for their Success Christianity he observed had made its way by Reason and Miracles but he profess'd it was his Design to save Men by the Sword From that time he began to knock down his FellowCitizens with a great deal of Zeal to plunder Caravans with a most exemplary Sanctity and to fill all  Arabia  with an unnatural Medly of Religion and Bloodshed  The Enemies of our happy Establishment seem at present to copy out the Piety of this seditious Prophet and to have Recourse to his laudable Method of Club Law when they find all other Means for enforcing the Absurdity of their Opinions to be ineffectual It was usual among the antient  Romans  for those who had saved the Life of a Citizen to be drest in an Oaken Garland but among us This has been a Mark of such wellintentioned Persons as would betray their Countrey if they were able and beat out the Brains of their FellowSubjects Nay the Leaders of this poor unthinking Rabble to shew their Wit have lately decked them out of their Kitchen Gardens in a most insipid Pun very well suited to the Capacity of such Followers  This manner of proceeding has had an Effect quite contrary to the Intention of these ingenious Demagogues For by setting such an unfortunate Mark on their Followers they have exposed them to innumerable Drubs and Confusions They have been cudgell'd most  unmercifully in every part of  London  and  Westminster  and over all the Nation have avowed their Principles to the unspeakable Damage of their Bones In short if we may believe our Accounts both from Town and Countrey the Noses and Ears of the Party are very much diminished since they have appeared under this unhappy Distinction  The Truth of it is there is such an unaccountable Frenzy and Licentiousness spread through the basest of the People of all Parties and Denominations that if their Skirmishes did not proceed to too great an Extremity one would not be sorry to see them bestowing so liberally upon one another a Chastisement which they so richly deserve Their Thumps and Bruises might turn to account and save the Government a great deal of Trouble if they could beat each other into good Manners  Were not Advice thrown away on such a thoughtless Rabble one would recommend to their serious Consideration what is suspected and indeed known to be the Cause of these popular Tumults and Commotions in this great City They are the  Popish  Missionaries that lie concealed under many Disguises in all Quarters of the Town who mix themselves in these dark Scuffles and animate the Mob to such mutual Outrages and Insults This profligate Species of Modern Apostles divert themselves at the Expence of a Government which is opposite to their Interests and are pleased to see the broken Heads of Hereticks in what Party soever they have listed themselves Their Treatment of our silly Countreymen puts me in mind of an Account in  Tavernier  's Travels through the  East Indies  This Author tells us there is a  great Wood in those Parts very plentifully stocked with Monkies that a large Highway runs through the middle of this Wood and that the Monkies who live on the one Side of this Highway are declared Enemies to those who live on the other When the Inhabitants of that Countrey have a Mind to give themselves a Diversion it is usual for them to set these poor Animals together by the Ears which they do after this Manner They place several Pots of Rice in the middle of the Road with great Heaps of Cudgels in the Neighbourhood of every Pot The Monkies on the first Discovery of these Provisions descend from the Trees on either Side in prodigious Numbers take up the Arms with which their good Friends have furnished them and belabour one another with a Storm of Thwacks to the no small Mirth and Entertainment of the Beholders This Mob of Monkies act however so far reasonably in this Point as the victorious Side of the Wood find upon the Repulse of their Enemies a considerable Booty on the Field of Battel whereas our PartyMobs are betrayed into the Fray without any Prospect of the Feast  If our common People have not Virtue enough left among them to lay aside this wicked and unnatural Hatred which is crept into their Hearts against one another nor Sense enough to resist the Artifice of those Incendiaries who would animate them to the Destruction of their Countrey it is high time for the Government to exert it self in the repressing of such seditious Tumults and Commotions If that extraordinary Lenity and Forbearance which has been hitherto shewn on those Occasions proves ineffectual to that Purpose these Miscreants of the Community  ought to be made sensible that our Constitution is armed with a sufficient Force for the Reformation of such Disorders and the Settlement of the publick Peace  There cannot be a greater Affront to Religion than such a tumultuous Rising of the People who distinguish the Times set apart for the National Devotions by the most brutal Scenes of Violence Clamour and Intemperance The Day begins with a Thanksgiving and ends in a Riot Instead of the Voice of mutual Joy and Gladness there is nothing heard in our Streets but opprobrious Language Ribaldry and Contention  As such a Practice is scandalous to our Religion so it is no less a Reproach to our Government We are become a Byword among the Nations for our ridiculous Feuds and Animosities and fill all the publick Prints of  Europe  with the Accounts of our Midnight Brawls and Confusions  The Mischiefs arising to private Persons from these vile Disturbers of the Common wealth are too many to be enumerated The Great and Innocent are insulted by the Scum and Refuse of the People Several poor Wretches who have engaged in these Commotions have been disabled for their Lives from doing any Good to their Families and Dependents nay several of them have fallen a Sacrifice to their own inexcusable Folly and Madness Should the Government be wearied out of its present Patience and Forbearance and forced to execute all those Powers with which it is invested for the Preservation of the publick Peace what is to be expected by such Heaps of turbulent and seditious Men  These and the like Considerations though they may have no Influence on the headstrong unruly Multitude ought to sink into the Minds of those who are their Abettors and who if they escape the Punishment here due to them must very well know that these several Mischiefs will be one Day laid to their Charge  No Friday June  Quod si in hoc erro libenter erro nec mihi hunc errorem quo delector dum vivo extorqueri volo  Cicer  AS there is nothing which more improves the Mind of Man than the reading of antient Authors when it is done with Judgment and Discretion so there is nothing which gives a more unlucky Turn to the Thoughts of a Reader when he wants Discernment and loves and admires the Characters and Actions of Men in a wrong Place  Alexander  the Great was so inflamed with false Notions of Glory by reading the Story of  Achilles  in the Iliad that after having taken a Town he ordered the Governor who had made a gallant Defence to be bound by the Feet to his Chariot and afterwards dragg'd the brave Man round the City because  Hector  had been treated in the same barbarous manner by his admired Hero  Many  Englishmen  have proved very pernicious to their own Countrey by following blindly the Examples of Persons to be met with in  Greek  and  Roman  History who acted in Conformity with their own Governments after a quite different  manner than they would have acted in a Constitution like that of ours Such a Method of proceeding is as unreasonable in a Politician as it would be in a Husbandman to make use of  Virgil  's Precepts of Agriculture in managing the Soil of our Countrey that lies in a quite different Climate and under the Influence of almost another Sun  Our Regicides in the Commission of the most execrable Murder used to justify themselves from the Conduct of  Brutus  not considering that  Caesar  from the Condition of a FellowCitizen had risen by the most indirect Methods and broken through all the Laws of the Community to place himself at the Head of the Government and enslave his Countrey On the other side several of our  English  Readers having observed that a Passive and Unlimited Obedience was payed to  Roman  Emperors who were possessed of the whole Legislative as well as Executive Power have formerly endeavoured to inculcate the same kind of Obedience where there is not the same kind of Authority  Instructions therefore to be learned from Histories of this Nature are only such as arise from Particulars agreeable to all Communities or from such as are common to our own Constitution and to that of which we read Atenacious Adherence to the Rights and Liberties transmitted from a wise and virtuous Ancestry Publick Spirit and a Love of ones Countrey Submission to established Laws impartial Administrations of Justice a strict Regard to National Faith with several other Duties which are the Supports and Ornaments of Government in general cannot bee too much admired among the States of  Greece  and  Rome  nor too much imitated by our own Community  But there is nothing more absurd than for Men who are conversant in these Antient Authors to contract such a Prejudice in favour of  Greeks  and  Romans  as to fancy we are in the wrong in every Circumstance whereby we deviate from their Moral or Political Conduct Yet nothing hath been more usual than for Men of warm Heads to refine themselves up into this kind of StatePedantry Like the Countrey Schoolmaster who being used for many Years to admire  Jupiter    Mars    Bacchus  and  Apollo  that appear with so much Advantage in Classick Authors made an Attempt to revive the Worship of the Heathen Gods In short we find many worthy Gentlemen whose Brains have been as much turned by this kind of reading as the grave Knight's of  Mancha  were by his unwearied Application to Books of KnightErrantry  To prevent such Mischiefs from arising out of Studies which when rightly conducted may turn very much to our Advantage I shall venture to assert that in our perusal of  Greek  or  Roman  Authors it is impossible to find a Religious or Civil Constitution any way comparable to that which we enjoy in our own Countrey Had not our Religion been infinitely preferable to that of the antient Heathens it would never have made its way through Paganism with that amazing Progress and Activity It's Victories were the Victories of Reason unassisted by the Force of human Power and as gentle as the Triumphs of Light over Darkness The sudden Reformation which it made among Mankind and which was so justly and frequently boasted of by the first Apologists for Christianity shew how infinitely preferable it is  to any System of Religion that prevailed in the World before its Appearance This Preeminence of Christianity to any other general Religious Scheme which preceded it appears likewise from this Particular that the most eminent and the most enlightned among the Pagan Philosophers disclaimed many of those superstitious Follies which are condemned by revealed Religion and preached up several of those Doctrines which are some of the most essential Parts of it  And here I cannot but take Notice of that strange Motive which is made use of in the History of Freethinking to incline us to depart from the revealed Doctrines of Christianity as adhered to by the People of  Great Britain  because  Socrates  with several other eminent  Greeks  and  Cicero  with many other learned  Romans  did in the like Manner depart from the religious Notions of their own Countreymen Now this Author should have consider'd that those very Points in which these wise Men disagreed from the Bulk of the People are Points in which they agreed with the received Doctrines of our Nation Their Freethinking consisted in asserting the Unity and Immateriality of the Godhead the Immortality of the Soul a State of future Rewards and Punishments and the necessity of Virtue exclusive of all silly and superstitious Practices to procure the Happiness of a separate State They were therefore only Freethinkers so far forth as they approach'd to the Doctrines of Christianity that is to those very Doctrines which this kind of Authors would persuade us as Free thinkers to doubt the Truth of Now I would appeal to any reasonable Person whether these great Men should not  have been proposed to our Imitation rather as they embraced these divine Truths than only upon the Account of their breaking loose from the common Notions of their FellowCitizens But this would disappoint the general Tendency of such Writings  I shall only add under this Head that as Christianity recovered the Law of Nature out of all those Errors and Corruptions with which it was overgrown in the Times of Paganism our National Religion has restored Christianity it self to that Purity and Simplicity in which it appeared before it was gradually disguised and lost among the Vanities and Superstitions of the  Romish  Church  That our Civil Constitution is preferable to any among the  Greeks  or  Romans  may appear from this single Consideration that the greatest Theorists in Matters of this Nature among those very People have given the Preference to such a Form of Government as that which obtains in this Kingdom above any other Form whatsoever I shall mention  Aristotle    Polybius  and  Cicero  that is the greatest Philosopher the most impartial Historian and the most consummate Statesman of all Antiquity These famous Authors give the Preeminence to a mixt Government consisting of three Branches the Regal the Noble and the Popular It would be very easie to prove not only the Reasonableness of this Position but to shew that there was never any Constitution among the  Greeks  or  Romans  in which these three Branches were so well distinguished from each other invested with such suitable Proportions of Power and concurred together in the Legislature that is in the most soveraign Acts of Government with  such a necessary Consent and Harmony as are to be met with in the Constitution of this Kingdom But I have observed in a foregoing Paper how defective the  Roman  Commonwealth was in this Particular when compared with our own Form of Government and it will not be difficult for the Reader upon singling out any other ancient State to find how far it will suffer in the Parallel  No Monday June  An tu Populum Romanum esse illum putas qui constat ex iis qui mercede conducuntur qui

apprehensive of every Tendency in the People or in any particular Member of the Community to endanger or disturb that Form of Rule which is established by the Laws and Customs of their Countrey This political Jealousy is absolutely requisite in some degree  for the Preservation of a Government and very reasonable in Persons who are persuaded of the Excellency of their Constitution and believe that they derive from it the most valuable Blessings of Society  This publickspirited Passion is more strong and active under some Governments than others The Commonwealth of  Venice  which hath subsisted by it for near fourteen hundred Years is so jealous of all its Members that it keeps continual Spies upon their Actions and if any one of them presume to censure the established Plan of that Republick or touch upon any of its Fundamentals he is brought before a Secret Council of State tried in a most rigorous manner and put to Death without Mercy The usual way of proceeding with Persons who discover themselves unsatisfied with the Title of their Soveraign in Despotick Governments is to confine the Malecontent if his Crimes are not Capital to some Castle or Dungeon for Life There is indeed no Constitution so tame and careless of their own Defence where any Person dares to give the least Sign or Intimation of being a Traitour in his Heart Our  English  History furnishes us with many Examples of great Severities during the Disputes between the Houses of  York  and  Lancaster  inflicted on such Persons as shew'd their Disaffection to the Prince who was on the Throne Every one knows that a factious Innkeeper in the Reign of  Henry  the Seventh was hanged drawn and quartered for a saucy Pun which reflected in a very dark and distant manner upon the Title of that Prince to the Crown I do not mention the Practice of other Governments as what should be imitated in ours which God be thanked  affords us all the reasonable Liberty of Speech and Action suited to a Free People nor do I take Notice of this last Instance of Severity in our own Countrey to justify such a Proceeding but only to display the Mildness and Forbearance made use of under the Reign of His present Majesty It may however turn to the Advantage of those who have been instrumental in stirring up the late Tumults and Seditions among the People to consider the Treatment which such a lawless ungoverned Rabble would have met with in any other Countrey and under any other Soveraign  These Incendiaries have had the Art to work up into the most unnatural Ferments the most heavy and stupid part of the Community and if I may use a fine Saying of  Terence  upon another Occasion  to convert Fools into Madmen  This Frenzy hath been raised among them to such a degree that it has lately discovered it self in a Sedition which is without a Parallel They have had the Foolhardiness to set a Mark upon themselves on the  Pretender  's Birthday as the declared Friends to his Cause and profest Enemies to their King and Countrey How fatal would such a distinction of which every one knew the meaning have proved in former Reigns when many a Circumstance of less Significancy has been construed into an Overt Act of High Treason This unexampled Piece of Insolence will appear under its just Aggravations if we consider in the first place that it was aimed personally at the King  I do not remember among any of our popular Commotions when Marks of this Nature have been in Fashion that either Side were so void of common Sense as to intimate by them  an Aversion to their Soveraign His Person was still held as sacred by both Parties The Contention was not who should be the Monarch over them but whose Scheme of Policy should take Place in his Administration This was the Conduct of Whigs and Tories under King  Charles  the Second's Reign when Men hung out their Principles in different coloured Ribbons Nay in the Times of the Great Rebellion the avowed Disaffection of the People always terminated in evil Counsellors Such an open Outrage upon Majesty such an Ostentation of Disloyalty was reserved for that infamous Rabble of  Englishmen  who may be justly looked upon as the Scandal of the present Age and the most shameless and abandoned Race of Men that our Nation has yet produced  In the next Place It is very peculiar to this Mob of Malecontents that they did not only distinguish themselves against their King but against a King possessed of all the Power of the Nation and one who had so very lately crushed all those of the same Principles that had Bravery enough to avow them in the Field of Battel When ever was there an Instance of a King who was not contemptible for his Weakness and want of Power to resent insulted by a few of his unarmed dastard Subjects  It is plain from this single Consideration that such a base ungenerous Race of Men could rely upon nothing for their Safety in this Affront to His Majesty but the known Gentleness and Lenity of his Government Instead of being deterred by knowing that he had in his Hands the Power to punish them they were encouraged by knowing that he had not the Inclination In a word they presumed upon that Mercy  which in all their Conversations they endeavour to depreciate and misrepresent  It is a very sensible Concern to every one who has a true and unfeigned Respect for our National Religion to hear these vile Miscreants calling themselves Sons of the Church of  England  amidst such impious Tumults and Disorders and joining in the Cry of HighChurch at the same Time that they wear a Badge which implies their Inclination to destroy the Reformed Religion Their Concern for the Church always rises highest when they are acting in direct opposition to its Doctrines Our Streets are filled at the same Time with Zeal and Drunkenness Riots and Religion We must confess if Noise and Clamour Slander and Calumny Treason and Perjury were Articles of their Communion there would be none living more punctual in the Performance of their Duties but if a peaceable Behaviour a love of Truth and a Submission to Superiors are the genuine Marks of our Profession we ought to be very heartily ashamed of such a profligate Brotherhood Or if we will still think and own these Men to be true Sons of the Church of  England  I dare say there is no Church in  Europe  who will envy her the Glory of such Disciples But it is to be hoped we are not so fond of Party as to look upon a Man because he is a bad Christian to be a good Church of  England  Man  No Friday June  Bellua Centiceps  Hor  THERE is scarce any Man in  England  of what Denomination soever that is not a Freethinker in Politicks and hath not some particular Notions of his own by which he distinguishes himself from the rest of the Community Our Island which was formerly called a Nation of Saints may now be called a Nation of Statesmen Almost every Age Profession and Sex among us has its Favourite Set of Ministers and Scheme of Government  Our Children are initiated into Factions before they know their Right Hand from their Left They no sooner begin to speak but Whig and Tory are the first Words they learn They are taught in their Infancy to hate one half of the Nation and contract all the Virulence and Passion of a Party before they come to the Use of their Reason  As for our Nobility they are Politicians by Birth and though the Commons of the Nation delegate their Power in the Community to certain Representatives every one reserves to himself a private Jurisdiction or Privilege of censuring their Conduct and rectifying the Legislature There is scarce a Freshman in either University who is not able to mend the Constitution in several Particulars We see 'Squires and Yeomen coming up to Town every Day so full of Politicks that to use the Thought of  an ingenious Gentleman we are frequently put in mind of  Roman  Dictators who were called from the Plough I have often heard of a Senior Alderman in  Buckinghamshire  who at all publick Meetings grows drunk in Praise of Aristocracy and is as often encountered by an old Justice of Peace who lives in the Neighbourhood and will talk you from Morning till Night on the  Gothic  Balance Who hath not observed several Parish Clerks that have ransacked  Hopkins  and  Sternbold  for Staves in favour of the Race of  Jacob  after the Example of their Politick Predecessors in  Oliver  's Days who on every Sabbath were for binding Kings in Chains and Nobles in Links of Iron You can scarce see a Bench of Porters without two or three Casuists in it that will settle you the Right of Princes and state the Bounds of the Civil and Ecclesiastical Power in the drinking of a Pot of Ale What is more usual than on a Rejoicing Night to meet with a drunken Cobler bawling out for the Church and perhaps knocked down a little after by an Enemy in his own Profession who is a Lover of Moderation  We have taken notice in former Papers of this Political Ferment being got into the Female Sex and of the wild Work it makes among them We have had a late most remarkable Instance of it in a Contest between a Sister of the  White Rose  and a beautiful and loyal young Lady who to shew her Zeal for RevolutionPrinciples had adorned her pretty Bosom with a  Sweet William  The Rabble of the Sex have not been ashamed very lately to gather about Bonfires and to scream out their Principles in the Publick Streets In short there is hardly  a Female in this our Metropolis who is not a competent Judge of our highest Controversies in Church and State We have several Oisterwomen that hold the Unlawfulness of Episcopacy and Cinder wenches that are great Sticklers for indefeasible Right  Of all the Ways and Means by which this Political Humour hath been propagated among the People of  Great Britain  I cannot single out any so prevalent and universal as the late constant Application of the Press to the publishing of StateMatters We hear of several that are newly erected in the Countrey and set apart for this particular Use For it seems the People of  Exeter    Salisbury  and other large Towns are resolved to be as great Politicians as the Inhabitants of  London  and  Westminster  and deal out such News of their own Printing as is best suited to the Genius of the MarketPeople and the Taste of the County  One cannot but be sorry for the sake of these Places that such a pernicious Machine is erected among them for it is very well known here that the making of the Politician is the breaking of the Tradesman When a Citizen turns a  Machiavel  he grows too cunning to mind his own Business and I have heard a curious Observation that the Woollen Manufacture has of late Years decayed in Proportion as the Paper Manufacture has encreased Whether the one may not properly be looked upon as the Occasion of the other I shall leave to the Judgment of Persons more profound in political Enquiries  As our Newswriters record many Facts which to use their own Phrase  afford great Matter of Speculation  their Readers speculate accordingly and by their variety of Conjectures  in a few Years become consummate Statesmen besides as their Papers are filled with a different PartySpirit they naturally divide the People into different Sentiments who generally consider rather the Principles than the Truth of the Newswriter This Humour prevails to such a Degree that there are several wellmeaning Persons in the Nation who have been so misled by their favourite Authors of this kind that in the present Contention between the  Turk  and the Emperor they are gone over insensibly from the Interests of Christianity and become Wellwishers to the  Mahometan  Cause In a word almost every Newswriter has his Sect which considering the natural Genius of our Countreymen to mix vary or refine in Notions of State furnishes every Man by Degrees with a particular System of Policy For however any one may concur in the general Scheme of his Party it is still with certain Reserves and Deviations and with a Salvo to his own private Judgment  Among this innumerable Herd of Politicians I cannot but take Notice of one Sett who do not seem to play fair with the rest of the Fraternity and make a very considerable Class of Men These are such as we may call the  Afterwise  who when any Project fails or hath not had its desired Effect foresaw all the Inconveniencies that would arise from it though they kept their Thoughts to themselves till they discovered the issue Nay there is nothing more usual than for some of these wise Men who applauded publick Measures before they were put in Execution to condemn them upon their proving unsuccessful The Dictators in Coffeehouses are generally of this Rank who  often give shrewd Intimations that Things would have taken another Turn had They been Members of the Cabinet  How difficult must it be for any Form of Government to continue undisturbed or any Ruler to live uncensured where every one of the Community is thus qualified for modelling the Constitution and is so good a Judge in Matters of State A famous  French  Wit to shew how the Monarch of that Nation who has no Partners in his Soveraignty is better able to make his Way through all the Difficulties of Government than an Emperor of  Germany  who acts in concert with many inferior FellowSoveraigns compares the first to a Serpent with many Tails to one Head and the other to a Serpent with one Tail to many Heads and puts the Question which of them is like to glide with most Ease and Activity through a Thicket The same Comparison will hold in the Business of a Nation conducted by a Ministry or a whole Kingdom of Politicians  No Monday June  Tu nisi ventis  Debes ludibrium cave  Nuper solicitum quae mihi taedium  Nunc desiderium curaque non levis  Hor  THE general Division of the  British  Nation is into Whigs and Tories there being very few if any who stand Neuters in the Dispute  without ranging themselves under one of these Denominations One would therefore be apt to think that every Member of the Community who embraces with Vehemence the Principles of either of these Parties had thoroughly sifted and examined them and was secretly convinced of their Preference to those of that Party which he rejects And yet it is certain that most of our FellowSubjects are guided in this particular either by the Prejudice of Education private Interest personal Friendships or a Deference to the Judgment of those who perhaps in their own Hearts disapprove the Opinions which they industriously spread among the Multitude Nay there is nothing more undoubtedly true than that great Numbers of one side concur in reality with the Notions of those whom they oppose were they able to explain their implicit Sentiments and to tell their own Meaning  However as it becomes every reasonable Man to examine those Principles by which he acts I shall in this Paper select some Considerations out of many that might be insisted on to shew the Preference of what is generally called the WhigScheme to that which is espoused by the Tories  This will appear in the First place if we reflect upon the Tendency of their respective Principles supposing them carried to their utmost Extremity For if in this case the worst Consequences of the one are more eligible than the worst Consequences of the other it is a plain Argument that those Principles are the most eligible of the two whose Effects are the least pernicious Now the Tendency of these two different Sets of Principles as they are charged upon each Party by its Antagonists is as follows  The Tories tell us that the WhigScheme would end in Presbyterianism and a Commonwealth The Whigs tell us on the other side that the ToryScheme would terminate in Popery and Arbitrary Government Were these Reproaches mutually true which would be most preferable to any Man of common Sense Presbyterianism and a Republican Form of Government or Popery and Tyranny Both Extremes are indeed dreadful but not equally so both to be regarded with the utmost Aversion by the Friends of our Constitution and Lovers of our Countrey But if one of them were inevitable who would not rather chuse to live under a State of excessive Liberty than of Slavery and not prefer a Religion that differs from our own in the Circumstantials before one that differs from it in the Essentials of Christianity  Secondly Let us look into the History of  England  and see under which of these two Schemes the Nation hath enjoyed most Honour and Prosperity If we observe the Reigns of Queen  Elizabeth  and King  James  I which an impudent  Frenchman  calls the Reigns of King  Elizabeth  and Queen  James  We find the WhigScheme took place under the first and the ToryScheme under the latter The first in whom the Whigs have always gloried opposed and humbled the most powerful among the  Roman  Catholick Princes raised and supported the  Dutch  assisted the  French  Protestants and made the Reformed Religion an Overbalance for Popery through all  Europe  On the contrary her Successor aggrandized the Catholick King alienated himself from the  Dutch  suffered the  French  Power to increase till it was too late to remedy it and abandoned the Interests of the King of  Bohemia  Grandfather  to His present Majesty which might have spread the Reformed Religion through all  Germany  I need not describe to the Reader the different state of the Kingdom▪ as to its Reputation Trade and Wealth under these two Reigns We might after this compare the Figure in which these Kingdoms and the whole Protestant Interest of  Europe  were placed by the Conduct of King  Charles  the Second and that of King  Wiliam  and every one knows which of the Schemes prevailed in each of those Reigns I shall not impute to any Tory Scheme the Administration of King  James  the Second on Condition that they do not reproach the Whigs with the Usurpation of  Oliver  as being satisfied that the Principles of those Governments are respectively disclaimed and abhorred by all the Men of Sense and Virtue in both Parties as they now stand But we have a fresh Instance which will be remembred with Grief by the present Age and all our Posterity of the Influence both of Whig and Tory Principles in the late Reign Was  England  ever so glorious in the Eyes of  Europe  as in that Part of it when the first prevailed Or was it ever more contemptible than when the last took Place  I shall add under this Head the Preference of the WhigScheme with regard to Foreignners All the Protestant States of  Europe  who may be considered as Neutral Judges between both Parties and are Well wishers to us in general as to a Protestant People rejoice upon the Success of a WhigScheme whilst all of the Church of  Rome  who contemn hate and detest us as the great Bulwark of Heresy are as much pleased when the opposite Party triumphs in its Turn And here let any impartial Man put this  Question to his own Heart whether that Party doth not act reasonably who look upon the  Dutch  as their genuine Friends and Allies considering that they are of the Reformed Religion that they have assisted us in the greatest Times of Necessity and that they can never entertain a Thought of reducing us under their Power Or on the other hand let him consider whether that Party acts with more Reason who are the avowed Friends of a Nation that are of the  Roman  Catholick Religion that have cruelly persecuted our Brethren of the Reformation that have made Attempts in all Ages to conquer this Island and supported the Interest of that Prince who abdicated the Throne and had endeavoured to subvert our Civil and Religious Liberties  Thirdly Let us compare these two Schemes from the Effects they produce among our selves within our own Island and these we may consider first with regard to the King and secondly with regard to the People  st With regard to the King The Whigs have always professed and practised an Obedience which they conceive agreeable to the Constitution whereas the Tories have concurred with the Whigs in their Practice though they differ from them in their Professions and have avowed a Principle of PassiveObedience to the Temptation and afterwards to the Destruction of those who have relied upon it Nor must I here omit to take Notice of that firm and zealous Adherence which the WhigParty have shewn to the Protestant Succession and to the Cause of His present Majesty I have never heard of any in this Principle who was either guilty or suspected of Measures to defeat this Establishment or to overturn it since it has taken effect A Consideration  which it is hoped may put to silence those who upbraid the WhigSchemes of Government with an Inclination to a Commonwealth or a Dissaffection to Kings    dly  With regard to the People Every one must own that those Laws which have most conduced to the Ease and Happiness of the Subject have always passed in those Parliaments which their Enemies branded with the Name of Whig and during the Time of a WhigMinistry And what is very remarkable the Tories are now forced to have Recourse to those Laws for Shelter and Protection by which they tacitly do Honour to the WhigScheme and own it more accommodated to the Happiness of the People than that which they espouse  I hope I need not quality these Remarks with a Supposition which I have gone upon through the whole Course of my Papers that I am far from considering a great Part of those who call themseves Tories as Enemies to the present Establishment and that by the Whigs I always mean those who are Friends to our Constitution both in Church and State As we may look upon these to be in the main true Lovers of their Religion and Countrey they seem rather to be divided by accidental Friendships and Circumstances than by any essential Distinction  No Friday June  caestus artemque repono  Virg  A Rising of Parliament being a kind of Cessation from Politicks the  Freeholder  cannot  let his Paper drop at a more proper Juncture I would not be accessary to the continuing of our Political Ferment when Occasions of Dispute are not administer'd to us by Matters depending before the Legislature and when Debates without Doors naturally fall with those in the two Houses of Parliament At the same time a  British  Freeholder would very ill discharge his Part if he did not acknowledge with becoming Duty and Gratitude the Excellency and Seasonableness of those Laws by which the Representatives of Men in his Rank have recover'd their Countrey in a great measure out of its Confusions and provided for its future Peace and Happiness under the present Establishment Their unanimous and regular Proceeding under the Conduct of that honourable Person who fills their chair with the most consummate abilities and hath justly gained the Esteem of all sides by the Impartiality of his Behaviour the absolute Necessity of some Acts which they have passed and their Disinclination to extend them any longer than that Necessity required Their manifest Aversion to enter upon Schemes which the Enemies of our Peace had insinuated to have been their Design together with that Temper so suitable to the Dignity of such an Assembly at a Juncture when it might have been expected that very unusual Heats would have arisen in a House of Commons so zealous for their King and Countrey will be sufficient to quiet those groundless Jealousies and Suspicions which have been industriously propagated by the Ill wishers to our Constitution  The Undertaking which I am now laying down was entered upon in the very Crisis of the late Rebellion when it was the Duty of every  Briton  to contribute his utmost Assistance to the Government in a manner suitable to his Station and Abilities All Services which had a Tendency to this End had a Degree of Merit in them in proportion as the Event of that Cause which they espoused was then doubtful But at present they might be regarded not as Duties of private Men to their endanger'd Countrey but as Insults of the successful over their defeated Enemies  Our Nation indeed continues to be agitated with Confusions and Tumults but God be thanked these are only the impotent Remains of an unnatural Rebellion and are no more than the Aftertossings of a Sea when the Storm is laid The Enemies of His present Majesty instead of seeing him driven from his Throne as they vainly hoped find him in a Condition to visit his Dominions in  Germany  without any Danger to himself or to the Publick whilst his dutiful Subjects would be in no ordinary Concern upon this occasion had they not the Consolation to find themselves left under the Protection of a Prince who makes it his Ambition to copy out his Royal Father's Example and who by his Duty to His Majesty and Affection to His People is so well qualified to be the Guardian of the Realm  It would not be difficult to continue a Paper of this kind if one were disposed to resume the same Subjects and weary out the Reader with the same Thoughts in a different Phrase or to ramble through the Cause of Whig and Tory without any certain Aim or Method in every particular Discourse Such a Practice in Political Writers is like that of some Preachers taken Notice of by Dr  South  who being prepared only upon two or three Points of Doctrrine run the  same Round with their Audience from one end of the Year to the other and are always forced to tell them by way of Preface These are Particulars of so great Importance that they cannot be sufficiently  inculcated  To avoid this Method of Tautology I have endeavoured to make every Paper a distinct Essay upon some particular Subject without deviating into Points foreign to the Tenor of each Discourse They are indeed most of them Essays upon Government but with a View to the present Situation of Affairs in  Great Britain  so that if they have the good Fortune to live longer than Works of this Nature generally do future Readers may see in them the Complexion of the Times in which they were written However as there is no Employment so irksome as that of transcribing out of one's self next to that of transcribing out of others I shall let drop the Work since there do not occur to me any material Points arising from our present Situation which I have not already touched upon  As to the Reasonings in these several Papers I must leave them to the Judgment of others I have taken particular Care that they should be conformable to our Constitution and free from that Mixture of Violence and Passion which so often creeps into the Works of Political Writers A good Cause doth not want any Bitterness to support it as a bad one cannot subsist without it It is indeed observable that an Author is scurrilous in proportion as he is dull and seems rather to be in a Passion because he cannot find out what to say for his own Opinion than because he has discovered any pernicious Absurdities in that of his Antagonists A Man satirized by Writers of this Class is like one burnt  in the Hand with a cold Iron There may be ignominious Terms and Words of Infamy in the Stamp but they leave no Impression behind them  It would indeed have been an unpardonable Insolence for a FellowSubject to treat in a vindictive and cruel Style those Persons whom His Majesty has endeavoured to reduce to Obedience by  Gentle Methods  which he has declared from the Throne to be  most agreeable to his Inclinations  May we not hope that all of this kind who have the least Sentiments of Honour or Gratitude will be won over to their Duty by so many Instances of Royal Clemency in the midst of so many repeated Provocations May we not expect that  Cicero  's Words to  Caesar  in which he speaks of those who were  Caesar  's Enemies and of his Conduct towards them may be applied to His Majesty  Omnes enim qui fuerunt aut suá pertinaciâ vitam amiserunt aut tuá Misericordid retinuerunt ut aut nulli supersint de inimicis aut qui superfuerunt amicissimi sintQuare gaude tuo  tam excellenti bono et fruere cum fortuná et gloriá tum etiam naturá et moribus tuis Ex quo quidem maximus est fructus jucunditasque sapientiNihil habet nec fortuna tua majus quam ut possis nec natura tua melius quam ut velis quamplurimos conservare  As for those Papers of a gayer Turn which may be met with in this Collection my Reader will of himself consider how requisite they are to gain and keep up an Audience to Matters of this Nature and will perhaps be the more Indulgent to them if he observes that they are none of them without a Moral nor contain any thing but what is consistent with Decency and Good Manners  It is obvious that the Design of the whole Work has been to free the Peoples Minds from those Prejudices conveyed into them by the Enemies to the present Establishment against the King and Royal Family by opening and explaining their real Characters to set forth His Majesty's Proceedings which have been very grossly misrepresented in a fair and impartial Light to shew the Reasonableness and Necessity of our opposing the Pretender to his Dominions if we have any Regard to our Religion and Liberties And in a word to incline the Minds of the People to the Desire and Enjoyment of their own Happiness There is no Question humanly speaking but these great Ends will be brought about insensibly as Men will grow weary of a fruitless Opposition and be convinced by Experience of a Necessity to acquiesce under a Government which daily gathers Strength and is able to disappoint the utmost Efforts of its Enemies In the mean while I would recommend to our Malecontents the Advice given by a great Moralist to his Friend upon another Occasion that he would shew it was in the Power of Wisdom to compose his Passions and let that be the Work of Reason which would certainly be the Effect of Time  I shall only add that if any Writer shall do this Paper so much Honour as to inscribe the Title of it to others which may be published upon the laying down of this Work the whole Praise or Dispraise of such a Performance will belong to some other Author this  th  being the last Paper that will come from the Hand of the  Freeholder  The END  ERRATA  PAge l for  Jesuists  r  Jesuits  p l for  Oaths  r  Oath  p l for  the  r  their  p l for  Name  r  Names  p l
