 The Invasion A POEM TO THE QUEEN  By Mr  HILL    Nil actum est inquit nisi  Gallo  milite Portas  Frangimus  Regno  vexillum pono  Britanno  Quantulus at rediit  Juv Sat  LONDON  Printed for THO BICKERTON at the  Golden FlowerdeLuce  in St  Paul's ChurchYard    The Invasion A POEM  PRIDE  of the World permit an humble Muse  To snatch the Theme her Duty bids her choose  That so the boundless Zeal which now inspires  And warms my glowing Breast with  Loyal Fires    May teach my tow'ring Fancy to reherse  Your  Godlike  Actions in a lofty Verse  So shall Your  spreading Laurels  never die  Nor Your bright Deeds in dark  Oblivion  lie  But Ages yet unborn shall learn to bless  The  Author  of those Joys  their Children  must possess  Oh cou'd You see with how sincere a Flame  My Soul expands in Raptures at Your Name  How  pure  my Praise how  innocent  my Song  My Pray'rs how  ardent  and my Zeal how  strong    You  wou'd not cou'd not  think Your Virtuous Rays  Produc'd so base a Plant as  mercenary Praise    No hopes of Gain can stain my  honest  Pen  Nor can I stoop to write like flatt'ring Men  For tho'  Obscure  'mongst vulgar Crowds I lie  Skreen'd from the SUN of Your enliv'ning Eye  I bear a Loyal Soul and dare to do  Beyond the Pow'r of Man to serve a QUEEN like YOU  But 'tis a needless Art I practise now  Too low to HEAV'N and YOU we cannot bow  For Majesty like Yours and Pow'r Divine  Whose dazling Rays with spotless Lustre shine  By  innate  Force draw Praise from ev'ry Land  Nor  can  we give You  more  than You command  Envy  herself can spy no  doubtful  Act  Nor Malice from your  witness'd  Worth detract  Faction  disarm'd  submits to what You do  Nor can the brightest Praise reach  Pow'r  to flatter YOU  Long had  BRITANNIA  mourn'd a cloudy Fate  Depress'd with Fears for her  divided  State  Long had each willing Sister  wish'd  in vain  For Dreams  alternate  of the Crown and Chain  Invite 'em oft oft bear 'em  wide  again  Till Heav'n indulgent to the doubtful Isle  Look'd down with Pity and vouchsaf'd a Smile  What common Kings had found too hard to do  Some Pow'r  Coelestial  must attempt  anew    Thence  Jove  shot down from Heav'n his brightest Ray  To animate the purest part of Clay  From which Great UNION Godlike  ANNA  came  ANNA  the darling Favourite of Fame  By  Her  the wond'rous Task was bravely done  And the  Coy  Nymphs to kind Embraces won  At  Her Desire  Heav'ns mighty Mandates fly  And firm a  Gordian Knot  that Hell can ne'r unty  In a rough part of  Gallia  's Warlike Land  A craggy Ridge of Rocky Mountains stand  Whose steep Ascents and vast  unmeasur'd  Height  With pleasing Wonder strike the distant sight  Their solid sides vast Tracts of Land surround  And skreen bright Prospects of  Enchanted Ground    Here on a gaudy Throne of glitt'ring State  As Fortune  changeable  but  fix'd  as Fate  With Eagles Wings and Virgins lovely Face  Of Form inviting and unequall'd Grace  The Fiend  Ambition  sits and shines around the place  Imperial Crowns of Gold adorn her Head  From whence in wanton Curls her Tresses spread  Her Hands are elevated as her Look  One holds a Bloody Sword and one a Golden Book  On her Righthand appears her Sister  Pride    And crawling  Envy  guards the other side  Of either Sex unnumbred Swarms appear  And throng in Crowds to pay their Homage here  On all alike the crafty  Fury  smiles  With equal Art their various Thoughts beguiles  First draws them on to Fate then glories in their Spoils  For round large Hills o'erspread with shining Light  With Gold  refulgent  and with Diamonds  bright    Ten thousand Deaths in strange Disguises stand  And crush the rash Invaders of that LAND  Hither the News of  ANNA  's Honours came  The  pond'rous  Message burst the Trump of  Fame    And ev'ry Fiend grew pale and trembl'd at Her Name  An awful Silence swiftly follow'd this  And  Envy  's Snakes with fright forgot to hiss  Till from her Throne the shock'd Ambition starts  And in these Words her fix'd Resolves imparts  Ha shall I lose  at last  my boasted Pow'r  Long  have the Books of Fate foretold this Hour  Either my Empire falls or  ANNA  bleeds  But I waste time in  Words  behold my  Deeds    She saidand on the Ground her Ensigns threw  Extended wide her Wings and upward flew  And left her Train amaz'd and wondring at the View  Near the fam'd Borders of the River  Seine    Whose gentle Streams in large  Maeanders  twine  Whose swelling Floods by fertil Show'rs advance  And kindly wash the fairest Plains of  France    Versailles  a small but stately City lies  And rears her lofty Turrets to the Skies  Proudly she boasts the  Source  whence Honours spring  From the fix'd Residence of  Gallia  's King  For  there  that Mighty Monarch's Palace stands  Guarded by brawny Slaves in chosen Bands  Here  on a Bed of State the Tyrant lies  Pregnant with Hopes to make the World his Prize  Here  different Passions round his Bosom roll  And various Tortures rack his anxious Soul  Here  conscious Guilt invades his  wish'd  Repose  And magnifies the Number of his Foes  Now  he has mounted the Triumphant Car  Now  sinks beneath the Weight of adverse War  Here  Hopes and Fears  alternate  Changes bring  And  here  AMBITION finds her Fav'rite King  An unexpected Sleep had clos'd his Eyes  And seiz'd his Senses with a soft Surprize  When to the place the angry Fury came  Her Breast all boiling and her Eyes shot Flame  Son says the Fiend bright Darling of my Care  Pride of my Hopes and Subject of my Pray'r  Rouze from the Damps in which your Senses steep  'Tis not oh 'tis not  Now  a time to sleep  Have I for  this  your  lost  Advantage sought  For  this  your Pow'r with Blood of  Nations  bought  Have I for  this  your daring Breast inspir'd  And with hot Flames of War your Bosom fir'd  Have your great Stratagems bound  Europe  fast  And must a  Woman  break the Chain at last  Ah Prince  betimes  exert a vig'rous Care  Betimes  for Death or Victory prepare  For oh I fear nay more than  fear  I  know    From'  ANNA  's Arm you must expect a Blow  And who opposes  Her  has Heav'n to be his Foe  In vain abroad your dreadful  Cannons  roar  In vain your  Fleets  at home defend your Shoar  In vain your  Armies  Foreign Vict'ries gain  In vain  Almanza  gave you conquer'd  Spain    And oh in vain your baffl'd Soldiers fight  While the two  Barriers  of your Pow'r  Unite    BRITAIN Great Prince by Heav'n and  ANNA  led  Has join'd  Two Bodies  to  One Sovereign Head    And if  divided  She cou'd shake your Throne  She may o'erturn it  Now  since into  UNION  grown  Rouze then and swiftly form some vast Design  Impending Dangers shou'd Dispatch incline  Speed  gives  Success  by Time 'tis lost or won  'Tis not 'twas bravely  Thought  but bravely  Done    I know your Courage  great  I know you  Wise    And therefore but  remind  you not  advise    You have a  British Prince  attends your Court  At least a  Prince  by His and Our Report  Contested Titles we dispute in vain  Kings  should not mind the  Justice  but the  Gain    Strike now a Wound just clos'd you'll soon renew  But if neglected  long  you'll find it hard to do  She saidand vanish'd swiftly from his sight  Lost in the sable Clouds of dusky Night  The frighted King in furious haste arose  Forgot the softer thoughts of his Repose  The Fury's Sting had touch'd his Vital Flood  And raging Fevers heats enflam'd his Blood  Revolving Thoughts consum'd the tedious Night  And Eastern Skies display'd the Morning Light  When the fierce King a hasty Summons sends  And each commanded Officer attends  The wond'ring Council in Confusion met  By the King's side the young  Pretender  sate  Fires in his Soul a flaming Wrath provoke  While thus with sparkling Eyes the  Gallick Tyrant  spoke  Lords of this Land where I so long have reign'd  Whose Loyalty your Courage has maintain'd  I call'd you hither  now  to let you know  I aim my Arrows at a  British  Foe  Their sudden  UNION  has my Hopes betray'd  We must dissolve the Tye that Knot has made  Not meanly  guard  our own but Hostile Shoars  invade    And  You  young Prince whose too unhappy Fate  Has cast you roughly from your Father's State  Shall have my Help to lift you to a Throne  That justly is  or ought to be  your own  It then remains You shou'd the Dangers weigh  That may a while defer the happy Day  Which if  You  dare but meet the Task be  Mine  To guide you safely through the vast Design  The  Gallick Fleet  shall shake the  British Shoar  With Force they never felt nor fear'd before  My best Commanders shall attend your Fate  And  chosen Troops  support your  Kingly State    This is my  Will  your  Answer  I expect  I have propos'd the  Task  and will the  Deed  effect  A rising Murmur from the buzzing Croud  Proclaim'd their Wonder and their Pleasure loud  While the  Pretender  spoke and as he spoke he bow'd  Illustrious Prince from whom my Fortune springs  Great Dread of  Nations  and great Chief of  Kings    Words  want the Pow'r to speak my rising Joy  Nor can my Tongue vain  Eloquence  employ  Give me my  Crown  and its  Command  shall shew  How much to  Your great Soul  I and my Subjects owe  Green  in the Field  unus'd  to Wars Alarms  Soldier in  bloom  and yet  unskill'd  in Arms  I'll bravely lead your conqu'ring  Squadrons  on  And wade through Seas of  Blood  to reach my Throne  Nor fear I  Dangers  nor can doubt  Success    Hell  cannot  curse  the Man whom  You  vouchsafe to  bless    He spokeThe smiling King the Speech commends  And sudden  Orders  o'er his Kingdom sends  Surpris'd  the Council rose and the great  Congress  ends  Now  from all parts the Din of War grows high  And  Trumpets  sound their  Summons  to the Sky  Tonitruous  Drums  in rougher Notes proclaim  The  Soldiers  Bus'ness and their  Leaders  Aim  Arms  long neglected now begin to  shine    And  neighing  Horses  snort  a Great Design  The Warlike  Ensigns  that the Chiefs prepare  In pendant  Curlings  fan the wanton Air  Love  's softer Arts no more amuse the Swains  And Nymphs are left abandon'd in the  Plains    To  War  's great Call Troops of bold Youths advance  The  Pride  of Valour and the  Bloom  of  France    With sprightly Joy they hear the loud Alarms  Forget their  softer Dress  and shine in glitt'ring  Arms  To  Dunkirk  's Port with hasty Zeal they fly  Where ready Ships of  War  in graceful Order lie  And now the fatal Morn' began to peep  When the strong Fleet must plough the Stormy Deep  In the gay  Town  the chosen Army lay  And with loud Shouts salute the welcome Day  The tuneful Trumpets echo from afar  With all the noisie Instruments of  War    The summon'd  Chiefs  to their fix'd places flew  And into Order all their Forces drew  The tops of Houses Crouds of Gazers heap  And from the Windows  Wives  and  Mothers  weep  With wringing hands a last Farewell they take  And wish the War Success  each  for her Husband's sake  In the broad  Front  with an unequall'd Pride  They saw the rash  Pretender  boldly ride  Grac'd by the  Warlike Chiefs  who rode on either side  Twice Fifty gallant Troops march slowly on  Whose Swords in frequent  Wars  had Vict'ries won  With graceful  Pride  their tall Commanders tread  And feather'd Plumes adorn each  elevated  Head  Their sloping Spears shine thro' the Citygate  And others bear for  Arms  the fiery Tubes of Fate  Thus march the haughty Train in pompous State  To gain the Strand where ready Vessels wait  A tempting  Gale  invites 'em soon aboard  And from the  Port  their hasty Ships unmoor'd  Saluting Cannons from the Bulwarks roar  And the Fleets  Thunder  shakes the Friendly Shoar  And  now  the formidable Ships of  France  From their strong Port to the wide Seas advance  Their tallow'd Keels divide the rolling Waves  And their smooth sides the rising Ocean laves  The skilful Mariners unfurl their Sails  Whose flutt'ring Canvass courts the swelling Gales  The manag'd Rudders break the Billows pow'r  And make 'em  guide  what they wou'd else  devour    To dreadful breadth the bulky Squadrons spread  Afrighted  Neptune  hides his hoary Head  And the  SeaMonsters  fly struck with a pannnick Dread  To  Caledonian  Land their Course they bend  And on her Coast their threatning Pow'rs descend  The craggy Rocks that guard the  Northern Shoar    Trembl'd and shook at their loud Thunders roar  And loos'n'd from their Roots that never mov'd before  But hold my MuseForget thy Foes a while  And turn a pleasing look to  BRITAIN  's Isle  On whose bless'd Fortunes Heav'n and  ANNA  smile  Soon had the watchful Eyes of PROVIDENCE  That ever wake and move for Her Defence  Perceiv'd the black Design their Forces seen  And told their  Numbers  to the happy QUEEN  The  Loyal Senate  flame with gen'rous Fire  And  their Examples  ev'ry Breast inspire  At the first Summons Crouds unnumber'd meet  And throw their  Lives  and  Fortunes  at Her Feet  Two  British  Fleets then plough'd the distant Main  One bore her  Natives  to the Coast of  Spain    Others in  Midland Seas  Vict'ries on Vict'ries gain  Mean while  Domestick Shoars unguarded lie  No equal Force to meet the Foe was nigh  But  ANNA  needs not  that  for Heav'n is Her ALLIE  Yet at Her Call tall Ships in Numbers meet  And form with wond'rous haste a Mighty Fleet  O'er the rough Seas commanded Squadrons fly  In their swift way no  dang'rous Barriers  lie  From  Her  they claim their  Force  their  Fortune  from the  Sky    Now the  brave Britons  whom the Seas obey  O'er moving Mountains force their watry Way  Their  crowded Sails  leave  loit'ring Birds  behind  And their stretch'd Breadth  monopolize  the Wind  Eager to fight their Ships for  War  prepare  Fly thro' the  Seas  and sail upon the  Air    Each lab'ring Hull the wond'ring Waves divides  And shakes the frighted Billows from her sides  Their bending Masts yield to the pow'rful Gales  And groaning Beams below proclaim the pond'rous Sails  When from their Watch the Fleets each other spy  With equal Joy contiguous Sails they ply  And look like two black  Clouds  gath'ring from either  Sky    Each to just length contract their spreading Line  And glitt'ring Weapons from their Rigging shine  Death  here invited leaves the peaceful Shoar  And lies conceal'd in ev'ry Cannon's Bore  Tempting their  fiery Rage  and courting them to roar  Britannia  's Sons with chearful Shouts come nigh  And their loud Triumphs pierce the vaulted Sky  On the high Decks the graceful Chiefs appear  Invite the Battle and disdain to fear  Their sprightly Trumpets loud Defiance sound  And wond'ring Fishes dance in Shoals around  With gentle force the Southern Breezes blow  And bear their dreadful Thunder on the Foe  But when the bold  Pretender  saw their Pow'r  And felt their Anger in a Sulph'rous Show'r  His  gifted Sword  forsook his trembling Hand  And his roll'd Eyes survey'd the distant Land  His fault'ring Tongue forgot a while to speak  And knocking Knees with sudden shocks grow weak  Strangely surpriz'd his anxious Thoughts appear  And drowns his Senses in the Gulph of Fear  Thus when the Noble Lion  sleeping  lies  Nor dreads the Danger of a base  Surprize    Some envious Fox who fears an  open  Strife  With  treach'rous  Guile attempts his  Royal  Life  But when He's  seiz'd  and in vindictive Claws  Quakes with a guilty Fear beneath the grasping Paws  Now the rash  Gallick  Chiefs amaz'd look'd round  No Hopes of Safety but by Flight they found  With heedless haste they clap their  Helms alee    And raise a shortliv'd Storm by  breaking  up the Sea  No more the Ships in their first Order join  Confusion  now divides the scatter'd Line  O'er the wide  Ocean  spread they lose their State  And fly  disorder  'd from pursuing Fate  They crowd more Sail than Rigging can supply  Grasp all the Winds that whizz along the Sky  And  court  the Tempests they were us'd to  fly    O'erloaden Vessels crack beneath their weight  And ev'ry Plank gapes wide and opens Death a Gate  Close to the Waves they lay their prostrate sides  The chalky  Keel  high o'er the Surges rides  And their swift  Prows  raise Foam upon the  murm'ring Tides    The wond'ring  Britons  view their sudden Flight  And bless with shouts the unexpected sight  With  equal haste  by  diff'rent Causes  led  To  equal breadth  their  Conqu'ring Squadrons  spread  Wellmanag'd Sails their stately Line extend  And their stiff Masts to the strong Canvass bend  Swiftly they scud along the wat'ry Plain  And by degrees a short Advantage gain  Then tempt their Rivals to dispute the Day  And with loud Cannons summon them to stay  From their tall sides a gen'rous Thunder roars  Echoing Defiance to the distant Shoars  While from the  Gallick  Sterns base Bullets fly  And Clouds of  shameful  Smoak invade the blushing Sky  In vain th'intrepid  Britains  tempt the Fight  In vain they strive to stop their eager Flight  In vain to animate their Foes they try  Beckon the Dangers Nature bids 'em fly  And court the bloody Blows which  Heav'n  and  France  deny  Long had their Ships  divided  urg'd their way  And grac'd the Seas that did their Pow'r obey  When a brave  Few  more happy than the rest  With  greater Speed  but  equal Courage  bless'd  O'ertake the hindmost of the Hostile Fleet  And with  unwelcome  Shouts their pow'rful Rivals greet  From each side  now  successive Thunder flies  On the rough Waves contending Vessels rise  Alternate Show'rs of Death blue Sulphur rain  Oceans of Blood the wat'ry Surface stain  And spread their purple Horror o'er the Main  Britannia  's Sons with brave Resentment flame  Gallia  must now support her sinking Fame  One side for  Honour  fights and one for  Shame    Hot Wombs of  Brass  new Births of  Fire  prepare  Thunder on Thunder shakes the smoaky Air  Sulphureous Clouds in curling Volumes rise  And Nitrous Gloom obscures the ambient Skies  Till dreadful Lightning flashing thro' the Night  Discloses horrid Scenes with momentary Light  Promiscuously the Ships in Battle join  Observe no Order keep no formal Line  But strive by diff'rent Arts to compass one Design  With deadly Force  Here  adverse Bullets meet  And with rough Shocks and  breaking  Fury greet  Here  rising Waves the meeting Vessels dash  And join their bulky Sides with hideous Crash  Now  grapling  Sailors Hand to Hand contend  Some desp'rately assail what some defend  Here  Sword from Sword with fearful Noise rebounds  Here  weighty Fauchions fix their dreadful Wounds  Here  by destructive Musquets Crowds expire  And  adverse  Parties fight in Storms of Fire  Three Elements in strange Disorder join  In vain the  strugling  Flames attempt to shine  Thro'  rising  Surges redhot Bullets fly  And dash the  hissing  Waters to the Sky  With  unresisted  Force they onward roar  Disjoin the Ships that  closely  fought before  And shake the  troubled  Seas and drive 'em to the Shoar  Now was the Time BRITANNIA shou'd advance  Her deathless Glories on the Fall of  France    Sing Loyal  Muse  by what strange turn of Fate  The faithless  Foe  preserv'd his sinking State  Say by what means  Jove  's Favour was obtain'd  And how by him secur'd they  Dunkirk  's Port regain'd  Shock'd at the  growing  Thunder of the Fight  And eager to behold the bloody Sight  Imperial  Jove  descends enthron'd on  Clouds    And  Heav'n's  bright Host attends in  shining  Crouds  At his Command the strengthen'd Air supports  The num'rous  Rulers  of Celestial Courts  Who stretch'd at wanton Ease  observant  lye  And frame a glorious  Heav'n  below the Sky  Not far from hence amidst th'unfathom'd Sea  There stands a  Rock  strong in a vast degree  Its  tow'ring  sides the roughest Storms outbrave  And mock the Fury of the  fiercest  Wave  High on its craggy  Top  old  Neptune  stood  Lord  of the  Regions  of the briny Flood  Around his Head a  whistling  Tempest blew  And his long Hair high from his Temples flew  His  rais'd  Right Hand his powerful  Trident  shook  And the loud  Ocean  trembled at his Look  Soon as he saw the  thund'ring  God descend  And fear'd the Consequence that might attend  He rais'd his dreadful Voice and thus began  While the  hush'd  Seas in  awful  silence ran  Brother  whose happier Fate has plac'd you high  And fix'd you  Ruler  of the starry Sky  Welcome  oh  welcome  for you come in time  To see me punish an unequal'd Crime  ANNA  the  Great  the  Just  of matchless Worth  Whom  Fate  decrees the Empress of the Earth  Urg'd by the pious Flames of  mutual  Love  And such as almost equals yours above  Gives the Command of the subjected  Main  To her blest  Consort GEORGE  the  Royal  DANE  Long has that happy PRINCE successful been  And Rul'd the  Navies  of his Darling QUEEN  Till o'er the wond'ring World  He  spread Her  Fame    And distant  Nations  trembled at her Name  My self  with Pleasure all my Pow'r resign'd  Gave  Him  a full Command o'er  Seas  and  Wind    For I submitted  still  to all that She design'd  Yet  Now  O daring Insolence this Foe  Whose wide  Ambition  injur'd Nations know  At her  lov'd  Breast has aim'd a  treach'rous  Blow  But  see  the conqu'ring  British  Fleet advance  Whose dreadful Cannons bear the Fate of  France    He saidand as he wou'd have spoken more  Jove  cast his Eyes upon the  Gallick  Shoar  Henceforth he cry'd  Rash  Prince more humble grow  Nor tempt the Anger of your  British  Foe  Fate  now  protects you if again you dare  Invade that Land a bloody Fall beware  This saida dusky Cloud he  downwards  threw  And Scenes of  Darkness  'twixt the  Navies  drew  Then smil'd in  Neptune  's Face and  upwards  flew  The furious  God  with Wonder view'd the Deed  And curs'd the Safety  Jove  to  France  decreed  He bent his stormy Brow against the Skies  Amazing Fires flash'd swiftly from his Eyes  And mad with raging  Passion  loudly cryes  Hah dares he thus invade a Brother's Right  Tho' I can ne'er repel his  Newfram'd  Night  I'll curse with equal  Plagues  their shameful Flight  He saidand made his willing  Tritons  meet  To guard from gath'ring Storms the  British  Fleet  Then with his  Trident  struck the hollow Rock  That three times trembled with the mighty shock  Thence issued  Boreas  with impetuous roar  And shook the  boyst'rous  Seas from Shoar to Shoar  Successive  Waves  in wat'ry Hills rise  steep    Disclosing all the  Horrors  of the Deep  Commission'd  Billows o'er each other roul  And  frightful  Prospects shock the bravest Soul  The  Gallick  Fleet the  Tempest  soon o'ertakes  And on their Ships with dreadful Horror breaks  Now  with strange Force the swelling Surges rise  And lift the mounting Vessels to the Skies  Then  from their  Keels  the  faithless  Waters fall  And to the muddy  Bottom  drop 'em all  The trembling  Sailors  ply their Ropes in vain  And gaping Planks admit the roaring Main  Their shatter'd Sails in num'rous pieces fly  And Tempests blow their  Streamers  to the Sky  Disjointed Rudders float upon the Waves  And groaning Numbers sink in wat'ry Graves  Disabled Vessels  meet  with sudden Shocks  And some are dash'd with force upon the Rocks  Some shrieking  Mariners  midst Waves Expire  Some dye by strange  Diseases  some by Fire  Death  in all Shapes and horrid Pomp appears  And  growing  Dangers swell beyond their Fears  Plague Wind  and  Sea  'gainst perjur'd  France  combine  And in her Ruin firm Confed'rates join  Till  longdeserv'd  Fatigues and Hazards o'er  A  scatter'd  Remnant gain their native Shore  Such Fate may  ANNA  's Foes for ever find  May HEAV'N on Her still smile nor  Hell  disturb Her Mind  FINIS
