 ELEGIES  I ON THE DEATH OF SAMUEL FOOTE ESQ  II ON AGE  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT Of the Theatre Royal DruryLane  LONDON Printed for J BEW in PaterNosterRow M DCC LXXVII  Price One Shilling  ADVERTISEMENT  EVERY one who amuses himself with writing Works of Imagination has a View to either Profit or Fame Though the Author of the following Trifles does not pretend to be above such Motives yet he hopes his Anxiety is not powerful enough to render him unhappy one Moment should he be entirely disappointed He is sensible how much Success depends upon Circumstances A Poem must be read before it can be admired nay more it must be read with some Share of that Temper and Spirit in which it was written or it will appear languid A good Character or a bad one given by those Gentlemen  who take upon themselves the Office of Public Censors in literary Matters will frequently at least for a Time determine its Fate As he is entirely unknown he is not in any Dread of a partial Sentence If these Poems are worthless let them rest in that Oblivion which is the utmost Happiness Unworthiness can know if the contrary happens to be the Case he has no doubt but their Merits will be seen and acknowledged by every one whom Heaven has blest with Taste and Judgment sufficient to form the true Critic  ELEGY I ON THE Death of S FOOTE Esq  ELEGY  I  AH what avails the fancied Lore of Man  Or all the envied Gifts the Gods bestow  His Wisdom Folly Length of Time a Span  His Life is Vanity his Death is Woe  II  Could Wit protect had Genius power to save  Did they immortal Life with Fame impart  Alexis ne'er had known a dreary Grave  Death ne'er had drench'd an Arrow in his Heart  III  Mourn mourn ye Spirits who delight in Mirth  In yonder Tomb Alexis breathless lies  The Soul of Wit that gave your Laughter Birth  Inhabits once again her native Skies  IV  How fix'd those Features which so well pourtray'd  The Cobweb Virtues of the canting Saint  How dull those Eyes that could so well upbraid  And Mimas' Vice in Mimas' Manner paint  V  Weep ye who bend beneath the savage Rod  Of stern Oppression spurning human Laws  Your Champion cover'd by yon senseless Sod  Hears not your Griefs or sure he'd plead your Cause  VI  Rejoice ye Sons of Rapine Io your Foe  Who dragg'd your dark Misdeeds to public Shame  Your scourge is fled no longer shall ye know  The Stings of guilty Terrot at his Name  VII  Where's now the pliant Muscle big with Whim  The Eye that fill'd with Laughter ev'ry Face  The various Voice the oftdistorted Limb  And all the mirthfed Features of Grimace  VIII  How ghastly  now  his Grin No latent Spark  Of newfound Wit sheds Dimples o'er his Cheek  No heavy Blockhead dreads himself the Mark  On whom the biting Gibe shall shortly break  IX  Where now the Shouts that Theatres have rent  While Laughter roar'd and begg'd to be reliev'd  Ah where the Plaudits every Hand has sent  When Humour brought forth all that Wit conceiv'd  X  Mourn every MUSE in Elegiac Song  In Metre melancholic let if flow  Adown the doleful Breeze your Griefs prolong  In Wails and Sighs and Tears shrill sad and slow  XI  But oh THALIA be thy Sorrows loud  Tho' allunus'd to Accents so severe  Ah shed the Drop most precious o'er his Shroud  For sure a Son like him deserves a Tear  XII  Full well he once was known thy dear Delight  Thou ne'er deny'd'st whate'er he deign'd to ask  Thy choicest Pen was his whene'er he'd write  And his whene'er he'd act thy choicest Mask  XIII  Ye shagged SATYRS leave the deep Recess  The dark close Woodland and the braky Dell  Quit every pointed Weapon of Redress  Hear shriek and hear your Fav'rite's passing Bell  XIV  No more we catch  your  Meaning from  his  Eye  No more he wields the manybarbed Dart  Or guides your galling Arrows as they fly  To strike the guilty Sinner thro' the Heart  XV  Ye lightwing'd SPRITES who sport in Fancy's Dome  With Freaks and Bounds in antic Circles play  Attend your kindred Genius to his Home  Proclaim him welcome to the Realms of Day  XVI  Ye SYLPHS who down the Sunbeams love to flit  And round the Poet's Temples Laurel twine  Or jocund on the dancing Ignis sit  Or quaff from azure Streams aetherial Wine  XVII  Forsake your Sports and if you know to weep  If e'er your silken Lids sustain such Dew  Here pour your Tearsbehold in endless Sleep  The Swain who all your Haunts and Frolics knew  XVIII  Ye FAUNS and FAIRIES wheresoe'er ye rove  O'er Hill o'er Dale or mid the Virgin Throng  Ye NYMPHS ye DRYADS of the Brook the Grove  Who sing so sweet in many a witching Song  XIX  Come FANCY'S OFFSPRING every CHILD of VERSE  Whatever Clime your printless Feet shall tread  Assemble ALLalternate Griefs rehearse  In solemn Song funereal Honours shed  XX  And as ye pass the Mountain Mead or Dell  Where lavish Nature strews her Gifts profuse  From Hawthorn's Point Grub's Beard or Lilly's Bell  Collect the Sweets that most delight the Muse  XXI  Bring every Spell and Charm each Fruit and Flower  Each Herb each Plant to Poet fragrant found  With all due Rites erect the Cypress Bower  And bless the Turf and consecrate the Ground  XXII  Then while coy Phoebe grants her glimm'ring Beam  And flitting Ghosts entrance the fearful Eye  On broken Vows while Maids forsaken dream  And start and weep with many a mournful Sigh  XXIII  While wanton RearMouse winds her mazy Rout  And squeaks to list'ning GlowWorm antic Song  Your Vigils keepwith shrill and sudden Shout  Scare each unhallow'd Foot from forth your Throng  XXIV  Enough fair FANCY lightly bound away  Advance PHILOSOPHY Lo TRUTH appears  Who with her sober Mien and moral Lay  Foretels the sad Events of future Years  XXV  Young Ammon  Alexander the Great  once admir'd belov'd obey'd  Grasp'd half the Globe and daft the Hours away  Crowns gave for Playthings Slaves of Monarchs made  Then dropt a little Lump of lifeless Clay  XXVI  Now what avails the fair historic Page  Where all his Acts are blazon'd to the World  What tho' th'Antipodes once selt his Rage  And 'gainst the Poles his Thunderbolts were hurl'd  XXVII  Had he not better far in peaceful Lore  Turn'd o'er the moral Page and smil'd serene  Than thus delighting in the Battle's Roar  T'have made the shrieking World one tragic Scene  XXVIII  Lost is his Valour lost to him his Fame  He heeds not hears not RUMOUR'S fickle Blast  And all who live to hear and read his Name  Are posting after him with heedless Haste  XXIX  With fancied Dignity important grown  Man acts as tho' his Follies were to last  Builds plants or mounts perhaps a thornstrew'd Throne  Dies rots and gives the Worms a short Repast  XXX  What melancholy Scenes salute his Eyes  Prophetic Lessons of approaching Fate  Still he pursues each Phantom as it flies  And loses Happiness in finding State  XXXI  Blest be the Sons of Science Nymph sublime  She lures her Children to the calm Retreat  And solves the Problem and suggests the Rhyme  And to the dulcet Sound directs the Feet  XXXII  She prompts the Song to Love to Peace and Joy  The matchless Music of Content she chants  Her heav'nborn Beauties ne'er her Lovers cloy  She knows no Sorrows for she feels no Wants  XXXIII  She philosophic Temp'rance loves to chear  And bids to shun like Death imagin'd Ills  Their Sweets are bitter thro' the plenteous Year  Who know no Medium to their wayward Wills  XXXIV  Blest be Alexis Science loves the Name  He well approv'd him of her darling Race  And be that Wretch accurst who damns his Fame  Or would his little Follies backward trace  ELEGY II ON AGE  ADVERTISEMENT  THERE is not any Thing I believe which calls forth the melancholy and sympathetic Passions more forcibly than a Sight of those Men who have once been great or famous and have outlived their Fortune or Faculties Who can forbear sighing when he beholds a BELISARIUS Whose Heart is not wrung when he views a SWIFT in his DotageReflections of this Kind gave Birth to the following Stanzas They were written upon an old Man in a CountryVillage whose Strength Activity and rustic Accomplishments were once the frequent Admiration of his FellowSwains and when Age had deprived  him of them and rendered him feeble and decrepid the Remembrance of his past Exploits was often the Subject of their Exclamations and the honest Motive of their Pity and Condolence as well as the frequent Topic of his own Lamentation The Effect that this Remembrance had upon his Mind cannot perhaps be conveyed more feelingly than by informing the Reader that the Sentence which I have chosen for a Motto was common in his Mouth and generally attended with a Sigh  ELEGY  There is a Time to be born and a Time to die  I  I ONCE was young alack the Day  And Mirth and Jollity my Theme  Now fourscore Summers flown away  Appear a halfforgotten Dream  II  I once could dance who nimbler seen  When MayDay Garlands deck'd the Pole  Or Prize propos'd to glide the Green  Who sooner reach'd the distant Goal  III  How slow and feeble now my Tread  Those Feet which erst have won the Prize  Are only swift to reach the Bed  Where undistinguish'd Merit lies  IV  This Arm athletic once could raise  The massy Beam the pond'rous Stone  Loud echo'd forth the Village Praise  When I the whirling Quoit have thrown  V  Behold it wither'd now and weak  Its brawny Texture quite forgot  Its languid Pulse slow winding seek  The Mansion where to rest and rot  VI  When I into the Circle sprung  What hardy Youth durst e'er engage  Who but would check his daring Tongue  If much provok'd he saw my Rage  VII  Where's now the Terror of my Eye  What Coward quakes tho' I should frown  When agile Feats they yearly try  Who brings to me the festive Crown  VIII  My auburn Ringlets once so gay  Could win the Sigh the wishing Glance  And envied went that Lass away  Who join'd me in the rustic Dance  IX  My bald Head sprinkled o'er with grey  Wins nothing but predictive Tears  Reminding Man from Day to Day  Th'Effects of muchdesired Years  X  I once could sing what Voice so sweet  Could charm an inattentive Ear  Or move the merrymaking Feet  Or melt the sighing Virgin's Tear  XI  Who now delights to hear my Voice  Who now shall press the cheerly Song  Who now shall listen who rejoice  Or give the Praise they gave me young  XII  Alas what Voice hath drooping Age  To charm the sprightly Ear of Youth  His Eye delights not in the Sage  His Heart delights not in the Truth  FINIS
