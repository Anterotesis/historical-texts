 ALFRED  A TRAGEDY  AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  LECTORI CREDERE MAVULT  HOR  DUBLIN PRINTED BY BYRN AND SON SYCAMOREALLEY FOR THE COMPANY OF BOOKSELLERS  MDCCLXXVII  PREFACE  THE success of a Dramatic piece on the Stage depends says Voltaire upon accidental circumstances but the day of publication decides its fate  Persuaded of the truth of this remark the Author of the Tragedy of Alfred would have submitted his performance to the final judgment of the Reader without preface or apology if he had not been advised and indeed urged to make a reply to some hostile criticisms which appear to have been founded upon prejudice and opinion rather than reason and argument  It has been alledged that the character of Alfred in the Tragedy does not agree with the character of Alfred in History "That the Hero the Legislator is degraded to a Lover who enters the Danish camp from a private not a public motive and acts the part of an impostor"  In Tragedy if the subject be Historical an author is not permitted to introduce events contrary  to the great established facts of History for instance in the Tragedy of Alfred the Hero must not be killed nor driven out of England by the Danes but preserving those ancient foundations as the piers of his bridge the Author may bend his arches and finish the fabrick according to his taste and fancy for the poet is at liberty and it is the essence of his art to invent such intermediate circumstances and incidents as he thinks will produce the most affecting situations In this department the Poet's fancy is controuled by nothing but probability and consistence of character the barriers of dramatic truth Let us apply this principle to the point in dispute  Alfred was a young man when he fought the battle of Ethendune The victory which gave him possession of the kingdom must have been gained before he begun to model the state Is it improbable to suppose that a young hero was in love Is it inconsistent to represent the person who was a Legislator when advanced in years as a lover in his youth Does it degrade the character of a hero to suppose that he was in love with the princess whom he afterwards married Is it not rather injurious to his heroism to conclude that he chose a consort whom he did not love If this reasoning is just there will be no difficulty in vindicating the subsequent conduct of the hero The dramatic and the real Alfred are both involved in the charge of imposture both entered the Danish camp in disguise the previous events as narrated in the tragedy are nearly the same with those mentioned in history Alfred for almost two years had wandered thro' England concealing himself under feigned names and characters He lived in the midst of his enemies by being supposed to be dead Emerging from this obscurity he appears in the tragedy and is informed of the alarming ambiguous situation of Ethelswida his usual stratagems present themselves one would think naturally to his mind extremely  agitated and prone both by temper and habit to the most daring and romantic enterprizes He resolves to enter the Danish camp to learn the fate of Ethelswida and observe the strength and order of the enemy's army before he ventures a decisive engagement  The continued artifice is inevitable The conduct of Alfred in the camp of Hinguar the manner in which he deceives the Dane is extremely similar to the conduct of Orestes in the Electra of Sophocles which no critic hitherto has blamed Orestes enters the palace of Aegisthus as the messenger of his own death carrying an urn which contains he says the ashes of Orestes whose untimely fate he most circumstantially relates The Grecian hero practises the deceit with an intention to kill the persons whom he deceives The English hero deceives Hinguar only to gain access to Ethelswida without meaning to hurt the person of his enemy To praise Sophocles and blame the author of Alfred for the same conduct seems a direct contradiction which can only be accounted for in one way an imaginary idea has been formed of the character of Alfred as an old mortified ascetic sage of spirit too sublime and aetherial to descend to human passions or human actions But the real as well as the dramatic Alfred was a young hero a bard a winner of battles brave and magnanimous but compelled by the pressure of those desperate times in which he lived to practise a thousand arts to exist by simulation and dissimulation Whoever recollects and weighs these circumstances will it is presumed readily pardon the artifice of Alfred in the Tragedy and acknowledge that the  feigned  incidents of the piece are altogether consistent with the true If not the author must be contented to labour under the imputation of an erroneous judgment for he meant nothing less than to degrade the character of Alfred on the contrary finding in the  records of a remote and barbarous age a hero of great renown but from the defect of his historians involved in clouds and darkness  Qui caput inter nubila condit  he was tempted to seize his name and display his character in new situations connected with the old and well known events of his life and fortune The play is printed as it was performed An alteration has been made in one scene and sent to the Theatre which if the Tragedy should be resumed or revived may perhaps contribute to heighten its effect  PROLOGUE  To furnish a new Prologue for each Play  To dress the selfsame dish a different way  Exhausts the poet's art And every year  Palates grow nicer rarities more dear  The cabinet who in the green room sit  The secret junto of the realm of wit  In these hard times resolved their stock to spare  And crib the Prologue from the bill of fare  Alfred  on English ground  alone  may stand  The darling hero of his native land  No no  our Poet cry'd  this is no time  Nor is it prudent now to save your rhime  Fir'd with my subject I have rashly dar'd  And you in Prologue should protect your bard  When my adventurous muse indulg'd before  Now vent'ring further needs indulgence more  She dares to trace the workings of a mind  The greatest and the best of human kind  Adjust its movements to dramatic plan  And blend the godlike hero with the man  The greater  Alfred's  fame our bard risks more  Such weight the flying courser never bore  Alfred  whose life such strange events adorn  That history beholds romance with scorn  Him to present here in his native land  Where still his genius and his laws command  Is an attempt like his who rashly tried  The burning chariot of the sun to guide  Yet this attempt from admiration rose  Nor should  he  find in  Alfred  's kingdom foes  He who by temper led not love of fame  Is the fond echo of your hero's name  EPILOGUE  BY Mr GARRICK  OUR bards of late so tragic in their calling  Have scarce preserv'd one  heroine  from falling  Whether the dame be widow maid or wife  She seldom from  their  hands escapes with life  If this green cloth could speak would it not tell  Upon its wellworn nap how oft I fell  To death in various forms deliver'd up  Steel kills me one night and the next the  Cup  The tragic process is as short as certain  With  She makes the motion of stabbing  THIS  or  And here of drinking po  on  THIS  I dropthen drops the curtain  No saint can lead a better life than I  For half is spent in study'ng how to die  The learn'd dispute how Tragedies should end  O happily  say someSome  death  defend  Mild  criticks wish good fortune to the good  While others  hotbrain'd  roar for blood blood blood  The fair tho' nervous tragic to the soul  Delights in daggers and the poison'd bowl  "I would not give a blackpin for a Play  "Unless in tenderness I melt away  "From pangs and death no lovers would I save  "They should be wretched and despairand rave  "And ne'er together liebut in the grave"  The brave  rough soldier  a  soft  heart discovers  He swears and weeps at once when dead the lovers  As down his cheeks run trickling nature's tide  "Damn itI wish those young ones had not dy'd"  Tho' from his eyes the drop of pity falls  He fights like  Caesar  when his country calls  In spite of critic laws our bard takes part  And joins in concert with the soldier's heart  O let  your  feelings with his party side  For once forgive me that I have not dy'd  Too hard that fate which kills a  virgin bride  Dramatis Personae  MEN  ALFRED King of England  Mr LEWIS  EDWIN Earl of Devonshire  Mr HULL  EARL of SURREY  Mr WHITEFIELD  HINGUAR King of the Danes  Mr AIKIN  ROLLO

TRAGEDY  ACT I  SCENE I A Camp  Earl of  DEVONSHIRE  and  OFFICER  OFFICER  THE name of Surrey and the shield he bore  With ease deceived the unsuspecting soldier  I knew the port of Alfred  DEVONSHIRE  So he thought  And ere he laid his weary limbs to rest  Gave me in charge to warn thee to be silent  OFFICER  My lord of Devonshire on me depend  Steel shall not tear the secret from my breast  Astonish'd as I am at such a secret  Who can unfold the cause Why at this hour  When big with England's fate each moment rolls  Does Alfred hide himself in clouds and darkness  And spread uncertain rumours of his state  Confounding all belief  DEVONSHIRE  He spread them not  From his uncertain fate those rumours rose  Ere since that time when the perfidious Dane  Attack'd the English in the hour of peace  On Alfred's wedding day  OFFICER  It was believed  That Alfred in the general carnage fell  At Cyppenham that in the swelling flood  Of wintry Avon Ethelswida perish'd  DEVONSHIRE  Such was the first report  OFFICER  Fain would I hear  Th' eventful tale of muchenduring Alfred  And what is yet of Ethelswida known  DEVONSHIRE  When faithless Hinguar with his host advanc'd  The King distracted for his lovely bride  Sent off a hundred knights by Surrey led  To guard the Princess to a place of safety  Then furious fac'd the Danewith odds opprest  Around their King his faithful nobles fell  Alfred by favour of the night escap'd  And wander'd long obscure from place to place  Thro' woods and forests like some beast of prey  By cruel hunters chac'd Much he endur'd  And much his people suffer'd English virtue  Like England's oak grew firmer from the storm  Often the peasant his last morsel brought  To the dark wood or cave where Alfred lay  If questioned by the Dane denied the deed  And died undaunted to preserve his prince  OFFICER  The story▪ thrills my blood by heaven and earth  Where did he rest at last  DEVONSHIRE  He never rested  Even when he had a place of refuge found  Where the deep winding streams Parret and Thone  Their waters mix a little island lies  With alders overgrown No name it had  Tho' now the name of Athelney it bears  Marshes and pools by inundation form'd  Perplex the dire approach There Alfred fix'd  His dreary habitation Two brave knights  At first were all his train Day after day  The numbers grew and many a gallant knight  Found out the wild asylum of his Lord  From thence with inroads fierce they gall'd the Dane  Dark as the spirits of the night they came  And vanish'd at the dawn In that retreat  The sun thro' every sign o'er Alfred roll'd  OFFICER  Did Ethelswida there rejoin her Lord  DEVONSHIRE  Nor she herself nor any of her train  Have ere been heard of since she left her Lord  OFFICER  For certain then she lives If she had perish'd  Her fate would have been known  DEVONSHIRE  The Danes ascrib'd  To me the inroads made by daring Alfred  And both the Danish princes took the field  Hinguar with fire and sword laid waste the land  Hubba his host to Kenwith castle led  And with strong siege begirt my ancient towers  Then Alfred issued from his lonely isle  Conceal'd as now beneath another name  OFFICER  Did Alfred fight in Kenwith's bloody field  DEVONSHIRE  He fix'd the fortune of that doubtful day  When Hubba with his life the REAFEN lost  Th' inchanted standard on whose magic wings  Conquest till then had flown The battle won  Alfred impatient bent his rapid course  To Westmorland where as he fondly hop'd  His Ethelswida dwelt He found her not  And late last night in deep despair return'd  OFFICER  I see the clouded tract thro' which he pass'd  InvisibleNow he has reach'd the point  And will break forth in splendor We shall fight  Tomorrow or today  DEVONSHIRE  On these steep hills  By nature and by art impregnable  Which far and wide command Wiltonia's vale  In absence of the King my camp I pitch'd  Audacious Hinguar occupies the plain  And braves us to descend  OFFICER  Proclaim the King  The King of England at his people's head  Then roll their rising valour on the foe  DEVONSHIRE  Thy zeal becomes thee He will chuse his time  Mean while the story of his death believ'd  Lessens the weight and burden of the war  Prevents the junction of the Danish chiefs  And makes our foes secure Soldier farewell  TheKing expects me In my tent he rests  OFFICER  My bosom throbs to see him rise in arms  Exit  Manet  'DEVONSHIRE  Spirits in Heaven may there attain perfection  But weakness in this world is nature's stamp  With which she marks the sons of men her own  Who can compare with this accomplish'd Prince  In valour or in virtue He excells  The Counsellor the Sage in civil wisdom  The light of ancient times shines in his soul  And the Bards listen to his voice divine  But vain his virtue and his wisdom vain  Against affection's power too much he lov'd  And mourns too much his Ethelswida lost  He comes with grief oppress'd  Enter  ALFRED  Health to the King  Has balmy sleep descended on his cares  ALFRED  My sleep is haunted with my waking thoughts  The vision of the night is Ethelswida  Sometimes a broken seene of other woes  My troubled fancy to her image joins  And adds the monarch's to the lover's grief  This very night in dreams I thought myself  Under the friendly roof where once I lay  Beset on every side with Danish spears  When to preserve my life a noble youth  The only offspring of a widow'd dame  Unknown to me my personage assum'd  And stopp'd the hounds that bay'd for Alfred's blood  DEVONSHIRE  O gen'rous youth  ALFRED  Full in the gate he stood  And brandishing his sword aloud proclaim'd  That England's King alive should ne'er be taken  Headlong the foes rush'd on Numbers he slew  At last unshrinking in his place he fell  And still the Danes believe that youth was Alfred  DEVONSHIRE  No wonder that they should  ALFRED  This very night  Pale in his wounds the gallant form appear'd  Whilst o'er the bleeding body of her son  Majestic in her grief his mother hung  Enter a  MESSENGER  MESSENGER  to  Devonshire  A warrior from the Danish camp demands  Admittance to thy presence  ALFRED  Let him enter  Exit  Mess  Alfred  walks aside  Enter a  WARRIOR  with his beaver down  DEVONSHIRE  Stranger unfold thy purpose  He takes off his helmet  Surrey by heaven  In Danish armour  Alfred  turning sees him  ALFRED  Ha  SURREY  My royal master  ALFRED  Surrey that strangearray thy aspect sad  Denounce thy tidingsEthelswida  SURREY  Lives  ALFRED  She livesWhy like the messenger of death  Dost thou before me stand Some dreadful thing▪  Thou smother'st in that pause I charge thee speak  What has befallen my love  SURREY  Captivity  ALFRED  Is Ethelswida captive  SURREY  Yes my Lord  ALFRED  To whom  SURREY  To Hinguar  ALFRED  To my mortal foe  Is she in Hinguar's power Is brutal Hinguar  The master of her fate  SURREY  Would that I durst  This painful truth deny  ALFRED  O wretched Alfred  Destin'd to suffer misery and shame  That princes seldom feel All other ills  Altho' in troops they came I have endur'd  Manhood and patience yield to this O Surrey  Had I been Surrey and hadst thou been Alfred  I ne'er had brought such tidings to my friend  SURREY  Great is the grief that renders thee unjust  Hear me O King and if thou blam'st me then  Illfated Surrey shall offend no more  ALFRED  What has my passion spoke Thy pallid cheek  Thy hollow eye those inauspicious arms  Are signals of distress  SURREY  The story hear  Of Ethelswida's fortune how it chanced  That Surrey lives to tell it  ALFRED  O my friend  Forget my words With destiny at odds  And with myself impatience glanc'd at thee  The martyr of my cause  SURREY  That fatal night  When with my precious charge I left my Lord  Thro' many dangers happily we pass'd  But when we reached fair Eden's distant vale  We found no refuge there  ALFRED  Too well I know  The Scots had raz'd Pendragon's lofty tower  Then whither didst thou fly  SURREY  There I dismiss'd  Most of my faithful Knights A few I kept  Of chosen men the choice Eastward we steer'd  Towards the wilds beyond the source of Tine  By midnight marches in untrodden paths  That wind o'er mountains vast thro' valley's deep  We reach'd a lonely mansion in a dale  Which at the foot of snowclad Cheviot lies  There Ethelswida found a safe retreat  And in those deserts wild she might have dwelt  Unheard of and unknown  ALFRED  Why did she not  SURREY  The rumour of thy death a tempest rais'd  Which from that harbour drove her out to sea  On me she laid her absolute commands  To guide and guard her as I could to Kenwith  My friends I warn'd to meet us on our way  And on we went till one unhappy time  The Danes surpriz'd us in a narrow vale  Against their fierce attack our little band  Around the Princess form'd a fence of steel  More and more narrow still the circle grew  Till I alone was left with Ethelswida  Alone I fought till at her feet I fell  Her dismal shrieks her piercing cries I heard  More grievous sar than all the wounds I bore  ALFRED  Methinks I hear her cries She call'd on Alfred  Did she not Surrey Providence divine  Why was not Alfred near  SURREY  As I have heard  From some who in the troops of Hinguar fought  For he it was who led the hostile band  She swoon'd with grief and terror on the spot  The Dane to her unwonted pity show'd  And rais'd her from the ground  ALFRED  Tell me the truth  Do not deceive me Surrey  SURREY  O my Lord  I never did nor will l now deceive thee  But of the Princess this I only know  That in the Danish camp she still remains  Guarded with care her name and rank unknown  ALFRED  What should I think Can she submit to live  To live her honour lost How didst thou 'scape  From such a slaughter And how cam'st thou hither  Commission'd by the Dane  SURREY  When night came on  Some English peasants who had seen the fight  Crept from their huts in secret to the field  With pious purpose to inter the dead  In me alone some sparks of life they found  Their care preserv'd me When my strength return'd  To Hinguar's camp I went gave out myself  Of Danish race altho' in England born  My service was accepted I have found  Favour in Hinguar's sight and in the band  That guards his person serve From them I learn'd  That Ethelswida near his tent is lodg'd  A mournful captive  ALFRED  Near his tent O heaven  How have I merited  DEVONSHIRE  Raise not thine eyes  Nor lift thy hands to heaven Far other looks  Far other actions heaven of thee requires  Thou art a king a soldier and a lover  Fight for thy crown thy country and thy bride  Go forth this instant animate thy troops  And lead them to revenge their wrongs and thine  Alfred  muses  Why does my royal master hang his head  And bend on earth his eyes  ALFRED  Forbear my Lord  To  Surrey  What is thine errand to the camp of England  SURREY  To offer battleBut the true intent  Of Hinguar is to learn if Alfred lives  For various rumours have perplex'd the Dane  ALFRED  He shall be satisfied I see a ray  Which thro' the darkness breaks It grows more bright  My friend the tumult of my thoughts forgive  Surrey  Goes aside with  Surrey  Manet  DEVONSHIRE  What does he meditate I know  His mind with dreadful images is fill'd  In Hinguar's arms he sees his ravish'd bride  Ravish'd or not she's captive to his foe  Enflav'd by force 'tis force must set her free  He cannot treat with Hinguar that he knows  By sad experience for the woes of Alfred  And all the evils of this hapless land  Arose from England's confidence in Denmark  No ties divine or human bind the Danes  Of all the impious race by far the worst  And most profane is Hinguar  ALFRED  to  Surrey  Go prepare  For my reception  SURREY  Ah may heaven avert  Those ills which my prophetic soul forebodes  Exit  Surrey  DEVONSHIRE  I heard the parting words of faithful Surrey  Which mark too well the colour of thy purpose  ALFRED  Thy approbation I do not expect  None can approve but those who feel like me  The Danish camp disguis'd I will explore  Clad in the vesture of a British Bard  And learn for certain Ethelswida's fate  Whatever has befallen my hapless bride  Assur'd of that my heart shall shake no more  DEVONSHIRE  Something like this my anxious soul foretold  ALFRED  I read thy thoughts but urge me not to hear  Thy friendly counsels which I cannot follow  In great events the agitated mind  Consults its genius only Low or high  The active spirits in that level flow  Nor fall nor rise to act another's counsel  That potent counsellor directs me now  I feel the impulse oft in perils felt  Nor is my arm confin'd to Ethelswida  The strength and order of the Danish host  How and what quarter I may best attack  Attentive I'll observe  DEVONSHIRE  Since thou hast fix'd  Thy resolution to contend is vain  The part of friendship now is to consult  How we may guard thee best  ALFRED  By the moon's light  As with a swift career their camp I pass'd  A wood extended on the right I saw  Their left the village Ethendune defends  Canst thou inform if they have opened paths  Or planted watches there  DEVONSHIRE  Neither my Lord  Presumptuous Hinguar holds such caution vain  ALFRED  When dusky eve descends in the dark time  Between the fall of night and the moon's rise  In silence thither march a thousand men  Chosen with care the bravest of our host  There let them watch till morn if no alarm  Comes ere the dawn at dawn they may retire  DEVONSHIRE  To choose and lead that band shall be my care  My warriours are the hunters of the Hill  Accustom'd to the woods fearless they move  By the pale glimpses of the clouded moon  To them the changeful aspects of the night  Whose false presentments armies oft confound  In all their forms are known  ALFRED  I wou'd not wish  A better leader nor a braver band  DEVONSHIRE  The word  ALFRED  St George  DEVONSHIRE  O may he guard the King  And as the minds of yonder heathen host  In darkness lie so may their eyes be dark  And blind to Alfred  ALFRED  As they still have been  This is no new tho' seeming bold attempt  I have essay'd it for a slighter cause  When in the Isle of Athelney Ilay  The quarters of the Dane I oft explor'd  In this disguise and mark'd destruction's line  Farewell thy wisdom no direction needs  Nor shall I long be absent

equal love is not return'd  HINGUAR  More grievous still The fair my soul desires  Cannot distinguish nor reward my love  If thou her cruel malady can'st charm  And drive wild frenzy from her troubled

alarm The English horse  When we advanced against them wheel'd and fled  What judgment hast thou form'd Did she say ought  In her Confession  ALFRED  She flew off at once  From that conceit Her mind's a burning fire  Where sudden thoughts like wreaths of smoak arise  And parting from the flame disperse in air  Her shatter'd fancy like a mirror broken  Reflects no single image just and true  But many false ones  HINGUAR  Dost thou hope to cure  The malady which thou describ'st so well  ALFRED  There is more ground of hope than cause of fear  HINGUAR  Forthwith the wonders of thine art essay  Meanwhile within the circle of my tents  Secure remain Gothred's imperious daughter  Whom in an evil hour when new in England  To please the Danes I was induc'd to wed  Is in the camp arriv'd I guess

desarts reign  But fair and fertile England is my own  The sword that won shall keep the pleasant land  I conquer'd for myself  RONEX  Talk'st thou of conquest  Thou woman's warrior who consum'st thy days  In secret lawless and inglorious love  Whilst o'er thy head thy slaughter'd brother's ghost  For vengeance shrieks in vain  HINGUAR  None of my foes  Of whom the fellest far I reckon thee  Shall

proof of my suspicion  For in thy presence with amazing art  She counterseits distraction Well I knew  Thy partial love would ill receive a charge  On mere conjecture founded What I saw  This day to certainty has chang'd my doubts  Try her my Lord and if I have deceived thee  I ask no mercy  HINGUAR  If she has deceiv'd me  As I believe she has I'll show her none  This is the Lover whom her songs

To practise upon me  ALFRED  Take back those names  Which utter'd here do not dishonour me  But on thy self return  HINGUAR  Ha Dost thou brave me  I'll pull thy courage down  ALFRED  Thou can'st not Hinguar  I mock the lifted sword and smile at death  HINGUAR  Tell me impostor who thou really art  And who that woman is thy false associate  In this vile artifice  ALFRED  Not from the dread  Of what thy vengeance can inflict I answer  But to assert my honour To thy tents  Altho' disguised I came no traitor I  I came not Hinguar to attempt thy life  But to enquire a muchlov'd sister's fate  For whom I trembled since the hour I heard  She was thy captive  HINGUAR  Ha thy sister say'st thou  What is thy name  ALFRED  Surrey  HINGUAR  Thy name is known  Of great account amongst the foes of Denmark  Thou art the chosen friend of English Alfred  ALFRED  His faithful subject  HINGUAR  What's thy sister's name  ALFRED  Emma Alas to great misfortune born  HINGUAR  Suspend a while thy judgment of her fortune  Retire  To the  GUARDS  who go off  The tale of Alfred was devised  To smooth thy way to Emma  ALFRED  So it was  Yet Alfred if alive in peril lives  And doubtful at this moment is his fate  HINGUAR  Dead or alive I care not If he lives  He never can regain his kingdom lost  Nor England e'er shake off the yoke of Denmark  Surrey tho' war and battle are my joy  Yet I desire sometimes in peace to dwell  Thy sister's beauty has inflam'd my heart  And policy accords with love's desire  The charming Emma shall be Hinguar's bride  And England partial to her own obey  Princes whose blood is native to the land  ALFRED  Thou hast a Queen  HINGUAR  What then The Gods of Denmark  Do not like yours their votaries confine  To the domestic bondage of one wife  My soul abhors the daughter of old Gothred  That furious woman who was once my Queen  Her I divorce and on her vacant throne  Will place thy sister  ALFRED  That her faith forbids  A Christian cannot wed a

fear we are discover'd and betray'd  That Danish woman whom I never lov'd  Has held a private conference with Hinguar  She pierces me with her malicious eyes  Swimming in joy and conscious of detection  She has o'erheard us  Hinguar  comes behind and seizes her arm  Ah  HINGUAR  Why dost thou start  And look so guilty Where's thy frenzy now  The artful semblance that deceiv'd the Dane  Thy fear betrays the fraud I knew before  Confess thy fault and trust to Hinguar's mercy  ETHELSWIDA  Mercy  HINGUAR  Altho' thou hast offended deeply  Thy beauty pleads for thee My love forgives  One victim is enough  ETHELSWIDA  One victim ah  HINGUAR  Yes thy associate the pretended Bard  Who call'd himself thy brother He hath paid  The forfeit with his life  ETHELSWIDA  Staggers ready to faint  Thou bloody Dane  Inhuman monster hast thou murder'd Alfred  And dost thou speak of love to Ethelswida  HINGUAR  Alfred and Ethelswida  ETHELSWIDA  Tyrant Yes  There's nothing now to save or to deny  In me behold the bride of royal Alfred  Thy treachery and not thy valour Dane  Upon our nuptial day divorc'd our loves  But neither force nor fraud can part us now  Where Alfred is my soul shall shortly be  HINGUAR  Thou'rt greatly chang'd This courage is not real  'Tis not thy nature  ETHELSWIDA  I shall change no more  My former fear from love extreme arose  Then life was dear to me for Alfred's sake  But now since he is dead for Alfred's sake  I wish to die and loath the life I lov'd  HINGUAR  'Tis bravely spoken  ETHELSWIDA  'Tis not my desire  To hold discourse with thee Go from my sight  Thou'rt hideous to my eyes thou vile assassin  Turns away  HINGUAR  Hear me  ETHELSWIDA  I wou'd not if I could prevent it  But what I can I will I speak no more  My lips are clos'd for ever  HINGUAR  Yet I know  A way to open them That bitter smile  I reck not no nor those averted eyes  Know I have turn'd thy arts against thyself  And caught thee in thy own deceitful snare  From impotence of mind thou hast reveal'd  Th'important secret that the bard was Alfred  Now if he dies it is thy folly kills him  He lives by thee discover'd to his foe  ETHELSWIDA  Does Alfred live and has my tongue betray'd him  Have I discover'd Alfred to his foe  Barbarian  HINGUAR  Still thou may'st preserve his life  His fate on thee depends  ETHELSWIDA  On me  HINGUAR  On thee  Accept my offer'd hand and Alfred lives  Nay reascends in peace his father's throne  If not I swear by Odin awful name  The God of battles whom alone I serve  This hour my rival dies  ETHELSWIDA  Is this thy mercy  Would Hinguar conscious that my heart is full  Of love to Alfred take a faithless hand  HINGUAR  I wou'd I will this instant speak the word  ETHELSWIDA  I shudder at the thought and loath thee more  Much more than ever Brutal is thy passion  And horrible to womankind thy love  HINGUAR  Is this thy answer Whilst the Saxon lives  Thou hast some hope Of him I will dispose  Without delay  Going  ETHELSWIDA  Stay I conjure thee stay  HINGUAR  My time is precious I have deeply sworn  And fix'd the only ransom of his life  ETHELSWIDA  Touch not the life of Alfred  HINGUAR  Every word  Thy

consent to be thy bride  Would Alfred's life be safe What pledge for that  What hostage hast thou worth the King or England  HINGUAR  Consider and demand  ETHELSWIDA  Set Alfred free  The English camp

HINGUAR  Set him free  And trust a woman's word I like it not  Fortune hath favour'd me beyond my hopes  My rival both in empire and in love  Is in my power How shall I best improve  The prosperous hour which my good planet rules  Enter  ERICK  ERICK  My Lord the valiant Rollo craves admittance  HINGUAR  I will not see him He is sent by Ronex  With some ungrateful message Ask his business  ERICK  Unask'd he told it In the field today  His brother press'd too near the English horse  They turn'd and took him pris'ner Rollo begs  That he may be exchang'd  HINGUAR  For whom  ERICK  For Surrey  Whom in the tent he saw  HINGUAR  He and his brother  And all their tribe are not worth such a ransom  Erick that Surrey is the King of England  Alfred himself  ERICK  Alfred  HINGUAR  He is by heaven  And my fair captive is the Mercian maid  By Alfred lov'd the beauteous Ethelswida  Go bring the Saxon hither  Exit  Erick  Manet  HINGUAR  Now I'll sound him  The policy of state enjoins his death  The politicks of love suspend his doom  The instrument he is by which I'll work  This woman to my will If I can make  Her lover false to her pride and revenge  Will bring her not reluctant to my arms  Thus play the passions of her way ward sex  Birds of a kind they build their nests alike  And one true falcon like another flies  So every woman when her love is scorn'd  By certain instinct takes the same revenge  Enter  ALFRED  in his first dress advances resolutely  Twice have we met today and both the times  With borrow'd names and forms thou hast deceiv'd me  Alfred I know thee now  ALFRED  Hinguar thou dost  HINGUAR  Repine not at this chance If we had met  In lists of combat or embattled field  Death or captivity had been thy portion  ALFRED  Uncertain ever is the fate of arms  HINGUAR  I have not found it so In every battle  On my victorious banners fortune waits  Suppose then that thou wert by chance of war  My pris'ner say what wou'dst thou now expect  Sould be thy doom  ALFRED  'Tis Hinguar's part to say  And mine to suffer  HINGUAR  Thou shalt suffer nothing  Unworthy of a king Tho' of the race  Of war and battle who have stretch'd the spear  Of conquest o'er mankind yet I will speak  The words of peace The English and the Danes  Have fought too long for this contested land  Whose spacious kingdoms can with ease contain  The rival nations and the fertile fields  Glut with luxurious plenty their desires  Let us divide the Land and join in league  Eternal Then united shake the world  ALFRED  Treaties of peace and leagues have oft been made  But how observed thou know'st  HINGUAR  There was no bond  To make the sormer treaties fast and sure  The peace I offer now shall be confirm'd  By ties which bind the nations to each other  My valiant brother left an only child  In Denmark born but here in England bred  Matchless in form and seature is the maid  Straight as the pine that grows on Norway's hills  She rises tall above the virgintrain  Blue rolls her melting eye Her heaving breast  Is whiter than the snow that's newly fallen  This maid of beauty I will give to Alfred  The pledge and bond of union and of peace  ALFRED  remains silent  Why dost thou not reply Dost thou disdain  A bride of Danish race  ALFRED  Silent I stand  To learn the full extent of thy design  Mean'st thou not still to blend the nations more  To mix the royal blood of either land  And wed thyself a wife of English race  HINGUAR  I do  ALFRED  And 'tis my bride that thou hast chosen  HINGUAR  Call her not thine Nothing belongs to thee  A captive has no right  ALFRED  Thou keep'st thy word  And treat'st me like a king  HINGUAR  I'll make thee one  Which now thou art not Wed the maid of Denmark  And o'er thy father's ancient kingdom reign  ALFRED  Unworthy I should be to reignto live  If I could make such barter of my honour  Is this the peace of Hinguar  HINGUAR  Yes no other  ALFRED  Are these the terms that thou propound'st to Alfred  HINGUAR  They are  ALFRED  I am a captive and urarm'd  So with impunity thou may'st insult me  HINGUAR  I stand astonish'd at thy pride thy folly  Thou ruin'd Alfred think of thy condition  Thy life or death upon my nod depends  ALFRED  Ruin'd I am but it was human weakness  And no disgraceful fault that ruin'd Alfred  Impell'd by tender anxious jealous love  Despising danger to thy tents I came  And dost thou think I am so quickly alter'd  Dost thou imagine that the dread of death  Can move my soul to yield to thee my bride  And lead if she would follow me to shame  Hinguar the meanest man of Saxon race  In freedom born would from such baseness shrink  And scorn with insamy to purchase life  HINGUAR  Thou talk'st it well and I have often heard  Of the persuasive eloquence of Alfred  Plain are  my  words They speak thy certain doom  If not the friend and firm ally of Hinguar  Thou dy'st  ALFRED  My death will not conclude the war  One course there is if greatly thou aspir'st  To reign supreme in England and possess  With honour gain'd fair Ethelswida's charms  HINGUAR  I do  ALFRED  Then mark me Dane Tho' thou art sprung  From heroes more than humanOdin's race  Who stretch'd the spear of conquest o'er the world  And thou thyself in war and battles bred  Chain'd to thy sword submissive fortune lead'st  Alfred▪ whose fathers have in battle fallen  Whose valour ne'er could fix inconstant fortune  Offers to meet thee in the listed field  And by his single arm to thineoppos'd  Decide the sovereignty of England's realm  By the award of heaven In this encounter  My nobles and my people will abide  And if thou conquer'st Ethelswida's thine  HINGUAR  What folly to presume thou fallen Alfred  That I will free my captive and contend  With him on equal terms  ALFRED  Brav'd as I was  I thought it fitting thus to meet thy scorn  Perhaps I entertain'd a glimpse of hope  That thou might'st choose thus nobly to prevail  To gain by valour warlike England's crown  And to the beauteous Ethelswida come  The victor not the murderer of her husband  HINGUAR  The beauteous Ethelswida has consented  To give her hand The terms which thou disdain'st  Vain glorious Saxon are more ample far  Than those which she did stipulate for thee  Thus she rewards the constancy of Alfred  Consider that  ALFRED  No not one moment Dane  Thy faith in love and war to me are known  HINGUAR  I will take no advantage of thy passion  Hear my determin'd purpose Thou shalt die  Or wed the maid of Denmark Heated now  And chaff'd with keen contention pride rebels  Against thy reason I will give thee time  To cool and take the counsel of thy judgment  One hour thou hast to think  To  Erick  Conduct him hence  ALFRED  Prudence requires that Hinguar too should think  Behold you banners streaming to the wind  The host of England will revenge their King  Exeunt  Alfred  and  Erick  HINGUAR  This Alfred bears a high and haughty mind  Not likely to submit Over his grave  The path of Hinguar lies When he is dead  After a storm of rage a flood of tears  The changeful sky of woman will grow clear  And beauty's beams on the new lover shine  Enter  EDDA  EDDA  The tidings which I bring my pardon plead  For this intrusion  HINGUAR  Say what has befallen  EDDA  Ronex the Queen pursues the Captive's life  Rollo devoted to her will address'd me  With promises of infinite reward  If I would lend my aid When I resus'd  He threaten'd me The party of the Queen  Was strong enough he said by force to right her  HINGUAR  That was his errand here  EDDA  I seem'd to slight  His menaces He kindled into rage  Swore that the bravest chiefs of Denmark's host  Were in his tent assembled with the Queen  And waited his return to rise in arms  And execute her orders  HINGUAR  I'll prevent them  And crush this nest of traitors Rollo's tent  That is the place  EDDA  It is  HINGUAR  Look to thy charge  Here thou art absolute the guards obey thee  Exit  Manet  EDDA  This lovely captive will at last be Queen  I must

reason ashes heaps in vain  Like Hercules I wear the poison'd robe  Thou pull'st the garment and my nerves are torn  Why didst thou wish to see the ruined Alfred  ETHELSWIDA  Not ruin'd yet His love endangered Alfred  My love shall save him still  ALFRED  Can there be truth  In Hinguar Now my soul begins to fear  ETHELSWIDA  What dost thou fear  ALFRED  The weakness of thy sex  ETHELSWIDA  The weakness of my sexI guess thy thoughts  What did the tyrant say of Ethelswida  ALFRED  What I despis'd discredited and scorn'd  He said that he had sought aud won thy love  That thou consented'st to become his bride  ETHELSWIDA  On what conditions  ALFRED  Then thou did'st consent  Hear men and angels hear  ETHELSWIDA  Angels and men  And Alfred hear and judge To save thy life  To stop the bloody tyrant's lifted arm  I did consent on this express condition  That Hinguar instantly shou'd set thee free  When certain of thy safety Alfred then  I was prepar'd and arm'd to mock the Dane  To die  ALFRED  Forgive me noblest of thy sex  Greater than fancy'd heroine of the song  Forgive the wrong I offer'd to thy virtue  ETHELSWIDA  Accept thy freedom let my hand restore  The king of England to his injur'd people  Robb'd of their hero by my luckless love  And when the time shall come as come it will  Unless the planet of this hour shou'd strike  That Alfred his predicted fate fulfils  And in the circle of his empire sits  With glory crown'd remember Ethelswida  Who died exulting to preserve her Lord  ALFRED  Remember thee This is no time to speak  To ope the floodgates of my bursting heart  Remember thee Whatever be my fate  Thou ne'er shall be forgot while Albion lifts  Her head above the waves But know my love  That this barbarian never was sincere  For other terms to me he has

offer he persisted  Gave me one hour more calmly to consider  The time's expired  ETHELSWIDA  Thou must not shalt not die  Rather  ALFRED  Rash is the counsel of affection  I know the character of Hinguar well  Nor life nor liberty will he bestow  On those whom he has wrong'd If I shou'd wed  The Danish maid I but embrace dishonour  And perish with addition of disgrace  ETHELSWIDA  What means the crafty Dane  ALFRED  I think he meant  To circumvent the soul of Ethelswida  Should I consent to wed a Danish bride  He hopes to rouze the woman in thy heart  And profit by the rage of slighted beauty  ETHELSWIDA  Perhaps the women of his savage land  Have taught him thus to judge of womankind  If they are like the clouds that change their form  And careless fly before each shifting gale  Far different is the soul of Ethelswida  Alfred thy love is dearer than my life  Dearer than both is Alfred's life or fame  In this extreme distress remove me far  Exclude me from thy thoughts suppose

Alfred  ETHELSWIDA  Not more incredible than that the person  Whose life thy rash resentment now pursues  Is Alfred's bride the princess Ethelswida  Born of a race dishonour never strain'd  And to the strictest rules of virtue bred  My soul O Queen devoted to my Lord  But one affection knows and worse than death  Abhors the love of Hinguar Thy protection  My sex demands and my misfortunes claim

This is the King of England  RONEX  I believe it  Before thou cam'st he had himself reveal'd  His royal presence warrants what he is  Princess the hatred and the fell intent  With which confessedly at first I came  Do not relate to thee unlike in all  To the imagin'd object of my wrath  My error pardon and my deeds shall show  The pity which I feel for thy misfortunes  The high esteem in which I hold thy virtue  ETHELSWIDA  Thy pity for distress thy love of virtue  Nobly thy deeds may prove Deliver Alfred  The victim of his love and of his virtue  Long is the tale too long to tell it now  But Hinguar's voice has doom'd my Lord to death  Because to him he wou'd not yield his bride  If then the cause of that decree offend thee  Treat with the King of England and prevent it  ROLLO  By Thor's right arm the lady counsels well  Renounce all thoughts of amity with Hinguar  Who never will forgive thy friends or thee  The insult of this dayUnite with England  And give the nations peace  RONEX

too far  With safety to recede If he who draws  His sword against a King away should throw  The useless scabbard what ought  he  to do  Who draws his sword against a fell usurper  Who dares not show the mercy of a Prince  RONEX  That argument comes near I'll urge it home  And when we have consulted and resolv'd  The King of England then  ALFRED  To their demands  Will cordially agree A common

 Still I suspect the faith of Danish friends  But most of all my soul distrusts the Queen  That furious woman who puts off the sex  And in her rage against her husband arms  ALFRED  Let us of what she is avail ourselves  And o'er the bridge she builds the torrent cross  Which roars unfordable  ETHELSWIDA  Before she came  Of the approaching night big with event  Thou wast about to speak Fain wou'd

wait If noble Surrey lives  Deeds will be done to night  ETHELSWIDA  And Hinguar too  He will not slumberSee the Dane returns  Enter  ROLLO  ROLLO  The Queen of Denmark and the chiefs in council  Thy presence wait to fix their last resolve  ALFRED  Whate'er on me depends they may command  Manet  ETHELSWIDA  Is the defect peculiar to myself  Or is it incident to womankind  By sudden strong impressions to be sway'd  The image of this dreadful Ronex haunts me  And like a ghost excites inhuman fears  When I was toss'd upon a sea of peril  In which my foot could reach no ground of hope  I swam with courage on the stormy waves  In shallower water now fearful I wade  Andreel at every surge She gaz'd on Alfred  Avow'd her admiration of his form  Enter  EDDA  EDDA  Lady I bring alarming

agreed  To join with England upon this condition  That English Alfred weds the Danish Queen  ETHELSWIDA  I saw it in her eyes foretold my fate  Should he refuse what then  EDDA  In that event  They mean to treat with Hinguar and restore  To him his captives But their hope is high  That Alfred will consent  ETHELSWIDA  Not whilst I live  But will the Danes permit a woman's life  To stand a wall between them and their purpose  The rage of Ronex like a swelling wave  Over that slender mound will burst amain  Woman to woman is the fellest foe  EDDA  And such a woman search from end to end  The world all nations and religions try  There is not to be found a parallel  To this unprincipled unbridled Ronex  The passion of the moment is the God  She always serves  ETHELSWIDA  Alas What shall I do  Who in the level of her fury stand  EDDA  Ronex thy deadly foe is also mine  Ere now beneath her hatred I had fallen  But for my pow'rful friend  ETHELSWIDA  Thy friendIs he  High in command  EDDA  To Bothnick Rollo next  Many and brave the warriors he commands  Behind thy tent the passage to the plain  This night he guards  ETHELSWIDA  My hopes revive again  Should I escape or if perchance I perish  No more my destiny entangles Alfred  For me the eagle left his airy way  And stooping in my tract his freedom lost  Edda if pity of my lost estate  Can move a woman's heart or vast reward  Induce thy soul to do an act humane  Persuade thy friend  EDDA  To what  ETHELSWIDA  To let me pass  EDDA  Then whither wilt thou go  ETHELSWIDA  If I can gain  The shelter of the neighb'ring wood I'm safe  But any place I hold more safe than this  Wilt'st thou assist me  EDDA  I embrace thy fate  Thro' the dark night and thro' surrounding arms  I shall attend thee hence if I can win  My friend to guide our steps Forthwith Ill try  Please to thy tent repair  ETHELSWIDA  I wrong'd thee once  And thou at last hast prov'd thyself my friend  With perfect trust my soul on thee relies  May angels prompt thy tongue  Exit  Manet  EDDA  No art of mine  The dread of Ronex working on her mind  Conjur'd each spectre up I wish'd to raise  I'll guide her steps committed to my care  And lead her safe to Hinguar's longing arms  End of the FOURTH Act  ACT V  SCENE The TentsAt a distance mountains and trees the moon in crescent and the stage darkened  Enter  ETHELSWIDA  ETHELSWIDA  HAD she not fail'd 'ere this she had return'd  Unbraced by vain suspense and expectation  My spirit flags and like a racer tired  Swerves in the course I am not what I was  Hark to that hollow soundIs it the hum  Of voices roll'd together in the wind  Or roars the blast of autumn through the woods  Alas I was not wont to fear the night  When wan'dring on the pleasant banks of Trent  By moonlight oft I trac'd the glittering stream  And mus'd on Alfred Peaceful were the sounds  And to my temper tun'd which then I heard  My steps light as they were amongst the leaves  From her high roost the fluttering stockdove scar'd  Or startled from his lair the bounding stag  Begirt with armies now hemm'd round with spears  I fear at every step to rouse a foe  Thro' the dim shades behold a human form  'Tis EddaAh what tidings  Enter  EDDA  EDDA  Goodand bad  ETHELSWIDA  Of Alfred what  EDDA  Enrag'd at his refusal  To wed their willing Queen the Danish chiefs  His sword demanded and to Rollo gave  Charge of his person Still they sit in council  New courses to devise  ETHELSWIDA  Would I were hence  Before those dreadful counsellors determine  What says thy friend  EDDA  He answers sor thy safety  If firm thy purpose be this night to fly  ETHELSWIDA  Blest be thy tongue  EDDA  What else remains to say  Or dothe cover of the tent will hide  ETHELSWIDA  Yet ere I plunge into the stream of fate  kneels  Angels and saints who once yourselves were human  Now perfect spirits and with Seraphs mix'd  Administer to heaven's eternal King  O hear my suppliant voice and to the throne  Where sovereign mercy sits prefer the prayer  Of one in deep distress who in the hour  Of her prosperity never forgot  To bow before your shrines Gracious descend  Thro' darkness night and death my footsteps guide  But if I'm doom'd in the rough Path to fall  O guard the King of England from the rage  Of cruel foespreserve the life of Alfred  Exeunt to the tent  Enter  ROLLO  with two  Danish  soldiers  ROLLO  It is the Queen's command  FIRST SOLDIER  The warrant's good  The Queen commands our swords  SECOND SOLDIER  Yes to kill men  Arm'd and resisting that's a soldier's task  To kill a helpless woman likes me not  ROLLO  If you demur  First  soldier  speaks aside to the second then turns to  Rollo  FIRST SOLDIER  My Lord we are resolved  ROLLO  I know you resolute and secret both  Selected you as worthy of reward  Befitting such a service  FIRST SOLDIER  We'll perform it  ROLLO  The deed when done must never be avow'd  But to the chance of this unruly night  Solely imputed  FIRST SOLDIER  Silent is the grave  Whoever sees us dies  SECOND SOLDIER  Look there my Lord  Ethelswida  and  Edda  in the back ground  Who may they be who yonder steal along  Timid their step and mien  ROLLO  Forthwith pursue  She in the azure mantle is the princess  Of her make sure  Exeunt the  Danes  Manet  ROLLO  Not without much regret  Did I consent to Ethelswida's death  My soul was loth to hurt the lovely maid  Loth to put out the radiant star of beauty  'Ere half her course was run Necessity  Impos'd this deed on my reluctant mind  For tho' the star was bright she beam'd destruction  And like a comet from her tresses shook  Discord and war  Enter  RONEX  RONEX  Are my commands obey'd  ROLLO  Just as my soldiers were about to enter  And execute their orders from the tent  With silent steps she stole they saw pursued  And have ere now o'ertaken  RONEX  Speed their swords  My fortune now is on the anvil placed  For fate to strike and fashion good or evil  Hinguar comes on dark as the night that shades him  ROLLO  He shall be met  Enter  MESSENGER  MESSENGER  Hail sovereignty of Denmark  A foe whom we expected not draws near  The host of England  ROLLO  Ha  MESSENGER  Cover the plain  Along their line I heard the voice of Erick  That traitor leads them on  ROLLO  Caught in a net  Spread by the hand of chance  RONEX  What shall we do  What refuge now in counsel or in arms  ROLLO  The King of England is our only refuge  Make him thy friend and he will quickly turn  On Hinguar's troops the torrent of his arms  RONEX  No choice is left Fly and bring Alfred hither  To the officer  ROLLO  In pledge of amity restore his sword  Manent  ROLLO  and  RONEX  RONEX  Rollo thou look'st as if thou didst repent  What we have done My soul's a constant stream  Which knows no changeful ebb  ROLLO  If Alfred should  Desire to see that Ethelswida's safe  RONEX  I'll find an answer fit He comes Behold him  O'er his fix'd eyes his frowning brows project  His mind is high wound up  Enter  ALFRED  ROLLO  Now King of England  Let no resentment of the past provoke  Thy soul to judge with passion of the present  Hinguar thy mortal foe comes on resolv'd  His lovely prize by valour to regain  Oppos'd to him we stand equal in arms  But from their hill the English host descend  To turn the scale of combat Dost thou wish  The tyrant to prevail  ALFRED  Answer direct  Thy question needs not Hinguar is my foe  Grant me those equal terms I ask'd at first  And to your arms I join the force of England  RONEX  Thy terms are more agreeable to Ronex  Than those the policy of Denmark nam'd  By Frea eldest goddess of the sky  The ancient arbiter of human things  I swear to the performance  ALFRED  In that tent  If Ethelswida rests I wish to see her  RONEX  Far from this spot where Hinguar points his march  The Princess to a safer place is mov'd  Near my pavilion  ALFRED  Ha  Enter  MESSENGER  MESSENGER  A fierce attack  Is on the right begun  ROLLO  The troops of England  If Alfred gives his aid it must be now  This officer will on thy steps attend  And to the Danish chiefs announce thy purpose  That is the way direct Along this path  I go to combat Hinguar  Exit  Rollo  ALFRED  Queen of Denmark  To the afflicted Captive comfort give  She is the bond and cement of our friendship  Exit  Alfred  RONEX  Then we shall ne'er unite He does suspect me  He rivitted on mine his jealous eyes  There is no proof and I will brave the suspicion  With loud appeals with vows and protestations  Of purest innocenceThat shout is near  It comes against the windMy foes prevail  Nearer and nearer still'Tis time to fly  On one side Alfred on the other Hinguar  Here let them meet and fight for Ethelswida  Exit  HINGUAR  behind the scenes  Pursue along the vale the leaders kill  But spare the common men  Enter  HINGUAR  with soldiers  HINGUAR  This is the place  Now I have reach'd the port of my desire  The prize of love and conquest anchors here  Where are the guards where she whom they shou'd guard  What does this awful solitude portend  Enter from the opposite side of the stage the two  Assassins  with the robe of  Ethelswida  stained with blood  SECOND SOLDIER  Twice have we chang'd our course To keep this robe  We lose ourselves  HINGUAR  By Hela's sulphur'd fires  The robe of Ethelswida stain'd with blood  Infernal villains  SECOND ASSASSIN  Caught undonethe King  FIRST ASSASSIN  Throwing down the mantle  We are but instruments to work the will  Of our superiors  HINGUAR  Have you killed the lady  Who own'd this garment  FIRST ASSASSIN  To deny were vain  The Queen commanded us and we obey'd  SECOND ASSASSIN  We know our fate and we will die like men  HINGUAR  Long shall you live in pain and wish for death  The ragged Saw shall tear your tortur'd limbs  And when your carcasses are all one wound  Fastened on iron hooks you shall be hung  And die by inchesBear them to their fate  Exeunt guarded  Enter  MESSENGER  MESSENGER  My Lord the troops which on the left advanc'd  Attack'd and soon subdu'd the guards of Ronex  But charged by English Alfred in their turn  Before him fly  HINGUAR  My trumpetssound a charge  And call the straggling soldiers to my spear  The charm that drew me to this spot will bring  The Saxon hitherOdin brace my arm  And let my sword like thine own thunder fall  On Alfred's crest  The trumpets sound  Enter  ALFRED  with  English  soldiers and the  OFFICER  of the first  ACT  ALFRED  Behold the man  HINGUAR  Whose steel  Shall pierce thy heart  ALFRED  Thy menaces barbarian  Tho' fierce and rude become thee better now  Than when I heard them last  HINGUAR  I threatened then  And now I will perform  ALFRED  My soldiers brave  Restrain your ardour  To Hinguar  Spare thy people King  Let us alone in mortal strife engage  Whilst every Dane and Saxon shall look on  And by the fortune of their Prince abide  HINGUAR  'Tis what I wish'd but did not think thou durst  Come from the crowd and single meet my arm  ALFRED  In more than this mistaken But by deeds  Not words I will convince thee  HINGUAR  Prompt thy tongue  But slow thy hand Come on Odin for Denmark  Draws  ALFRED  For England and her King the living God  They fight  Hinguar  falls  Now where is Hinguar's pride  HINGUAR  Here in his heart  Unconquer'd still the pride of Hinguar dwells  To die in battle is a warrior's death  The hero fights and falls but never yields  Hinguar has fought From sea to sea his sword  Thro' England blaz'd a meteor dropping blood  The wolf and eagle followed to the feast  Tracking its course The warrior old in arms  The youthful chief by many a virgin lov'd  Lay reeking in their gore  ALFRED  As thou dost now  The virgin's and the widow's curse have found thee  And laid in dust the troubler of the land  HINGUAR  In dust thy hopes are laid Behold that robe  Belike thou know'st it  ALFRED  Ethelswida's robe  With bloody gashes torn More fell than bears  That starve on hill of snow how durst thou lift  Thy cursed hand  HINGUAR  No Ethelswida fell  By Ronex Yet altho' I killed her not  Her death delights me Saxon I rejoice  At thy calamity Happy my lot  Compar'd with thine To the Valkyrian maids  I go to Odin and the hall of joy  Thou of thy love bereft shalt waste thy days  In lamentation like the wretch who pines  By Hela's lake and drinks the poison'd stream  Pour'd from the jaws of snakes I laugh at thee  And like my fathers die  dies  ALFRED  His dying voice  Of me prophetic fpake O Ethelswida  And Surrey too in Alfred's cause has fallen  Now on the top the summit of affliction  Like a tree stript of bark and branch I stand  Bare on all sides and naked to the storm  falls  Voice behind the scenes  Where is the conquering King my lord my husband  Make way and let me rushwhere is my Alfred  ETHELSWIDA  enters and sees him  Edwin  following  ETHELSWIDA  Eternal powers Is this the scene of joy  After a pause looking at the robe  am the cause accurst of Alfred's death  And England's ruin Bear me witness heaven  But words are vain Let those bewail their doom  Who live to suffer and prolong their pain  The gleam of hope extinguish'd by despair  Sharpens my sense of misery and spreads  A deeper horror on my tortur'd mind  My sure and now my only friend come forth  Draws a dagger  Spirit of Alfred stay  Alfred revives  ALFRED  The shades of death  Still swim before my eyes I heard the ghost  Of Ethelswida call  ETHELSWIDA  He lives he lives  My heart surcharg'd bursts with a flood of joy  ALFRED  Her voice her form 'tis she 'tis she herself  My Ethelswida  Runs into her arms  ETHELSWIDA  Alfred Gracious heaven  For ever blest thy Providence divine  ALFRED  In error lost upon the brink we stood  Of bottomless perdition O my love  Most certain seem'd thy death  ETHELSWIDA  I saw thee dead  And rais'd my arm to join my lot to thine  ALFRED  I heard the dagger fall It was reserv'd  For thee thou pride and glory of thy sex  To give the noblest proof of loveand live  ETHELSWIDA  Ere since the sad commencement of our woes  Deep on my heart engrav'd was the resolve  Not to survive thee in the storms of fortune  That anchor held like fate  ALFRED  Whence came that sign  Which friends and foes deceived  ETHELSWIDA  True was the sign  Of death The wearer of my garment died  For me mistaken  ALFRED  'Twas a wounded mind  Which laid me low Oppress'd with grief I sunk  Edwin my friend  DEVONSHIRE  Compleat is Edwin's joy  To see his Prince with love and glory crown'd  ALFRED  The scene is ghastly and with death deform'd  In place more fitting of our friends and foes  According to desert we will decree  The nations now are one with Hinguar died  The enmity of England and of Denmark  My people with their monarch shall be blest  Whilst such a partner of my empire reigns  ETHELSWIDA  Nor shall the story of the toils of Alfred  Sink to oblivion in the tide of time  Or to posterity descend in vain  From hence the people of the land he lov'd  And future Princes of that land may learn  Fearless to stem the torrent of disaster  And ne'er of England or themselves despair  FINIS
