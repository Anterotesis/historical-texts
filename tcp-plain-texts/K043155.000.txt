 THE HUMOURS OF AN ELECTION A  FARCE  As it is performed at the THEATREROYAL IN  COVENTGARDEN  Written by F PILON  LONDON  Printed for G KEARSLY in FleetStreet  M DCC LXXX  Price One Shilling  PROLOGUE  Written by the AUTHOR  And spoken by Mr WILSON  BEFORE we poll the town I wish to sound  And canvass for your votes and int'rest round  No bribes I bring to influence your voice  Our Candidate aims at being Freedom's choice  If unsuccessful he assures this borough  He'll call no critic scrutiny tomorrow  The public judgment he abides with awe  And owns your right to give the drama law  Sir Listless Lounge with wellbred yawn declares  He dreads encount'ring your election bears  What with the toil of canvassing he vows  And making speeches when one's in the house  So much of rights and liberties they rave  In these free states a man's a downright slave  "Oh keep one borough says Paddy to spare  "To give Captain Moore a bit of a share  "He bate four ships joy before he took one  "And he and I came from the very same town"  May we unblam'd with Humour's lightest wing  Thus touch the surface of pure Freedom's spring  To treat of liberty in our weak lays  Is placing soil beneath the diamond's blaze  Oh may our arms to that bright gem restore  The splendor which it boasted long before  Nor need we long despair to see that day  When vengeance shall foul treachery betray  Since Cornwallis commands and Tarlton leads the fray  Then peace once more shall rear her angel head  Bright as the Phoenix from her burning bed  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  Parmazan  Mr WILSON

Letitia  discovered  Parma  YOU are a fool Letty you don't know what it is to be married to a parlimentman he can do such things child lord he can do any thing  Letit  I confess father some parlimentmen of late have proved they can do any thing But surely you can never think my booby cousin will cut any figure in the House of Commons  Parma  Why not why not you satyrical baggage  Letit  He can't say boo to a goose  Parma  If he can nick the time to say aye or no he'll do more than a better orator  Letit  And to compleat the ridicule his mother canvasses for him Sure the spirit of absurdity has descended upon our family and determined we should be a public laughingstock She would have me with her yesterday and such a tramp as we had She took me through all the filthy alleys in town then we were obliged to kiss the children in every house we went into be they never so dirty and keep a pocket full of halfpence to slip into her hands a proof dear father of what a bribe can do when we can purchase nothing but a rattle with it  Parma  Why this was mere pastime to what I have gone through on my canvass I went yesterday to solicit the vote and interest of old Smoke Jack the chimneysweeper and found his whole family seated at a banquet of oxcheek and bacon I was pressed to eat you may be sure so down I sat between his two eldest boys as he called them so black that they looked more like two organized bags of soot than human beings I sat clear for some time 'till one of the lads reaching his brother the bread across me black'd all the side of my coat which as illluck would have it happened to be creamcoloured His father mad at his ill manners got up to strike him when the boy in striving to escape threw me and his brother down and before I got up I was black enough to pass for one of the family  Letit  And wasn't this sufficient to give you a surfeit of canvassing  Parma  What getting a dirty coat no no I never mind dirt in serving my country  Letit  Ah sir how happy were we before you took this notion in your head I then had hopes my dear Belfield would be mine  Parma  Why he takes pains to provoke me he has set up in opposition to George has open'd a house writes ballads gets drunk and is rising every day into consequence  Letit  O heavens if he should be return'd perhaps then sir you would relent  Parma  Zounds don't make me mad he shan't be returned George shall carry you and his election together  Letit  He may be returned for the borough of Bribewell but Belfield has an interest in my heart which no venal candidate can rob him of  Exit  Letitia  Parma  Grumble as much as you please ma'am but I am determined your marriage articles and the writs for the new parliment shall be returnable together I fancy there are sew who can say as much for themselves as Joe Parmazan I was bred a cheesemonger 'tis true but what of that when I have a son in the house his cloquence will pare off the rind of my obscurity I hope like his father be'll have all the blue mold of patriotism about him Let me see how stand my morning expences  Pulls the different articles out of his pocket as be names them  I have above three hundred pounds worth of goods in my pockets that at a just appraisement would not be valued at twenty shillings but election wares are ticklish articles and whilst the fair lasts keen chapmen will  have their prices Here's a piece of gingerbread that cost me five guineas that I could have bought for a penny at any baker's in London but no price is thought too high for real parliment cakes A child's trumpet too a pretty plaything this for a man of my age It cost me two guineas and I must wait 'till my grandson is born to blow me a tune upon it Here's fifty pounds slap in a case of razors These razors may shave keen but I think they never will cut so close as the fellow who sold them Here's a toothpickcase cost me twenty pounds If a man was to pay every day in the same proportion for his dinner he might soon shut up his mouth and give his teeth a holiday But oh monstrous in this paper I have a hundred hobnails for which I paid a hundred pounds down upon the nail I was nail'd hard in that bargain Here is some Scotch snuff and some court stickingplaister which cost me very dear but I don't mind that as they are articles which will be of great use to the Member when he gets into the house  Enter  Servant  Serv  Mr Canvass fir  Parma  Shew him in  Exit  Servant  Enter  Canvass  Parma  My deat Canvass how do you go on  Can  Swimmingly swimmingly sir I have secured all Corruptionrow Bribewellalley and Guzzledownstreet to a single elector  Parma  Was my sister with you  Can  Ay but she did me more harm than good she's too old to have any interest with the men and the elector's wives like to be kissed by the canvasser  Parma  Ecod so they do and if possible I should have undertaken the whole canvass myself but as I am rather too old now for so much business my dear boy don't spare yourself  Can  There's Full Bottom the barber what have you done with him I understand that he can command two votes besides his own  Parma  Lord he's one of us 'Twas I set him up he's only a housekeeper three days He lived in a dark hole he called a shop at the sign of  Gentlemen shaved for a penny  upon a paper lanthorn The other two votes are his journeymen fellows who have been all their lives garrethousekeepers but I have given security for a quarter's rent to qualify them  Enter  Servant  Serv  Mr Goose the taylor sir has just rode up to the door and desires to speak with you  Parma  Bid him come in  Exit  Servant  This is one of our sheetanchors he lives about seven miles off and has great interest among the farmers and alehouses Go you instantly to the Committee and see that nothing is neglected  Exit  Canvass  I have bespoke five suits of clothes of this Goose and yet the fellow has the impudence to talk of his conscience and refusing a bribe  Enter  Goose  booted and spurred  Parma  Dear Mr Goose I have been just wishing for you Come sit down sit down and tell us the news  Goose  I have rode hard Mr Parmazan to serve you and as I take no bribes I hope my horse hire will be paid for  Parma  You shall have the best gelding in my stable  Goose  I can't take it my conscience is buckram to a bribe  Parma  But my dear friend consider that you gave me your vote and interest before I made this offer Why if one friend cannot make another friend a present now and then without incurring the censure of corruption there's no friendship lest in the world  Goose  Not a shred Friendship's like broadcloth it wears well in all weathers But I have had a sad journey of it  Parma  I am sorry for that  Goose  The fright I believe was the worst of it for you must know that this was the first time I ever mounted any thing but a shopboard  Parma  You must want some refreshmentHere get some wineWhich do you choose red or white  Goose  I have no choice Good cloth's never of a bad colour  Enter  Servant  with wine  Parma  Then put that pint bottle of the choice Madeira on the table That bottle I assure you is twelve years old  Goose  Mercy on us it's the littlest thing of its age I ever saw  Taking up the bottle and looking at it archly  Parma  Come George's health to the bottom of your glass  Goose  I'll not leave a remnant behind me  Drinks  I made his first suit who wou'd have thought I was taking measure of a Parliament Man  Parma  Now let us proceed to businessYou must know my worthy friend I intend you for a leading man in my committee  Goose  You don't say so  Parma  There's something so consequential in your countenance so manly in your manner spite of your profession that you must command great respect in a croud  Goose  Odzookers what must I say to them  Parma  Huzza as often as possible Cry no bribery no corruption no hired mob and if our party meetmuch opposition cry no Scotchmen and it will do wonders  Goose  Aye damn the Scotch with all my heart they are no friends to our trade I hear as how one half of them wear no breeches  Parma  Off to the committee then immediately and be sure to cry loudly for liberty and property and the constitution  Goose  Friend Parmazan the skirts of the constitution are grown too long The lappells and buttons are increasing and they ought to be cut short after a new fashion  Exeunt  Enter  George  and Mrs  Highflight  Mrs Hig  Now I shall instruct you in the duty you owe your constituents  Geo  Why I thought I owed no duty but to father and mother  Mrs Hig  There is a confusion George in your ideas that makes me tremble for your success as a speaker in the House of Commons  Geo  Sure they won't make me speaker of the House the first time I go in I can speak to be sure but I must be a little us'd to my company  Mrs Hig  Has your oratorical preceptor been here yet  Geo  My roarotorical preceptor you should call him for he makes me bawl 'till I am hoarse again What do you think mother he would hav me clap two pebbles in my mouth to make me talk clear He told me DeDeDe something a great Grecian parliament man didn't speak a jot better than me till he used these pebbles  Mrs Hig  I have tried the pebbles myself child and I find they wonderfully assist me  Enter a  Servant  Ser  Mr Mac Rhetorick  Enter  Mac Rhetorick  Rhet  I hope I have the honor to find your Ladyship in parfect health I staid beyond my oor but I have so many young members from my ain country to instruct for the new Parliment that I have scarce a minute on my hands  Geo  Mr Mac Rhetorick I have one question to ask you I never ask'd before I hope no offence  Rhet  I attend your commands Sir  Geo  How the dickens can you come to teach me English when you can't speak it yourself It is for all the world as if a blind man should go to teach a young horse his paces  Mrs Hig  George George I do not like this spirit of opposition  Rhet  He will ken better Madam when he is in the hoose He will then find the value of a Caledonian preceptor  Enter  Parmazan  Parma  Come bustle bustle is our young Candidate almost ready Yonder go the mob shouting most delightfully Banners flying girls giggling every thing alive expecting the candidates on the hustings  Rhet  I am very glad Mr Parmazan you are come to be a watness of our young orator's progress in the most noble and perswasive art of eloquence but do not expect all the flower of a Ceecero from him  Parma  Flower damme do you think I'd have him a mealymouthed speaker  Mrs High  Brother your ignorance shocks me  Geo  They are falling out about me but I'll be shot if I know why for between my mother's high larning and my master's broad Scotch I may as well be amongst the wild Irish for what knowledge I get  Mrs High To Mac Rhetorick  My brother Sir does not expect from your tyro  Parma  His what  Mrs High  His tyro  Parma  Where the devil did you get that word it's not English  Mrs Hig  It's originally Latin and signifies a young student  Parma  A young student it's a better name for a young pointer  Geo  But when am I to speak my speech I shall forget it I never can keep one above two hours in my head  Rhet  Pegin as soon as you please Sir "Considêre duces" Sir  Geo  Yes yes I do consider the use of it  Parma  He shall stand in my great chair with the back facing us and he shall have a pillow for a cushion to thump if he's afraid of his knuckles  Geo  What shall I do I don't remember a word of what he wrote down for me  The chair brought forward  Ecod I have a mind to make a speech of my own I am sure I can do it as well as my master  Mrs Hig  Before child you ascend this humble rostrum  Geo  Lord mother what signifies preaching Parson Palmer so often I have hard words enough in my speech  Mrs High  Let grace be your grand object  Geo  How often mother have you called me graceless  Rhet  Do not forget your action action is the life and soul of oratory for as Demosthenes  Geo  That's the man that swallowed the pebbles  Parma  Zounds let the boy speak we don't want to hear you make speeches  Geo  No more we don't uncle so here goes but before I begin I have carried my election for I am chaired already  Rhet  Begin SirGentlemen  Geo  I think I had better say neighbours I'm sure it's more friendly But if it must be so Gentlemen tho' my mother's one of the company I say gentlemen I am your own town's boy born and bred amongst you  Rhet  What the deel is this Why man this is not my language  Parma  No I'll be sworn for it's English bad as it is  Mrs Hig  No delicate ear can bear this  Geo  You're devilish squeamish all of a sudden but hear me outIf you have a mind to make me a good parliament man let me speak as I think not as other people would have me  Parma  That's spoken like a trueborn Englishman George and should be written in letters of gold over the poll at every election  Enter a  Servant  Ser  You are sent for Sir by the committee  Parma  Odso I had like to have forgot myself Mr Mac Rhetorick do you and my sister watch him and drive it into his head if possible with hammer and mallet I must go the committee immediately  Rhet  If he be not parfect in proper

trade but whenever an Irishman talks upon the subject he's struck dumb  Geo  I am very glad to hear you are struck damb for now I'll speak my speechGentlemen  O' Shan  Why I've not done yet  Geo  I thought you said you was struck dumb  O' Shan  Och my dear that was only with gratitude for what my country owes to the generosity of England  Mob  Huzza O'Shannon O'Shannon  O' Shan  By the honour of a man I believe I have spoke my speech before I have ended it or else my friends have forgot to listen to what I had further to say to them  Par  I am afraid this fellow will make a bull and carry his election  O' Shan  I shall say no more gentlemen but if I lose my election I shall decline the poll and so great a respect have I for you all that I'll act the part of a faithful representative though I never am returned to a seat in parliament  Mrs High  Now my boy George must come forward how I tremble for him  Par  Now George my boy speak out boldly Goose stand behind him I hope we shall bring him through with honour  Geo  I am all of a twitter O uncle O mother dear Mr Goose if I want a word help me out  Par  On boldly my boy and we'll support you  Geo  Gentlemen the very great honour of your representing me in parliament  Par  You are speaking contradictions  Geo  I am speaking contradictions gentlemen but I hope my family will assist me  Par  What the devil has your family to do with the matter  Geo  What the devil has my family to do with the matter  Mrs High  George George have you forgot your speech  George  Let me alone my uncle's prompting me I first imbib'd these patriotic sentiments from my father and hope like my uncle to carry them to the grave with me  Par  Why you dog you're all abroad you are in Nova Scotia from the point  Geo  I am now gentlemen going abroad to Nova Scotia  Par  You had best travel next to Newfoundland  Geo  I shall next gentlemen travel to Newfoundland  Bel  This looks as if our young candidate was determined to take possession of the cod and whale fisheries  Geo  For I am determined to take possession of the cod and whale fisheries  Goose  Promise to beat the Congress rebels  Geo  And I'll take the whole Congress prisoners in the Towernow unclenowwhat is next  Par  O dam'me I have done with you  Geo  And then O dam'me I have done with you  Mob  No Highflight no Highflight  Mrs High  Sit down sit down for shame  Par  I'll disinherit you you dog if you open your lips farther  Goose  Go on go on  Geo  Go on go on indeed you have made a fine kettle of fish of it amongst you you have knock'd every word of that damn'd Scotchman's speech out of my head and so gentlemen as I have no more to say at present I beg you would consider of it and turn me out a member of parliament  Mob  Ay ay turn him out turn him out no Highflight no Highflight Belfield for ever  Par  We have lost the daybut I'll stay and hear what this Belfield has to say for himself  Geo  What shall I do I am asham'd to stay upon the hustings and I am afraid of my mother if I leave them  Mob  Silence hear Mr Belfield hear Mr Belfield speak  Belfield  comes forward    Belf  Gentlemen I solicit your support this day to be returned one of your representatives because I consider the confidence of the people to be the highest poslible honour an Englishman can boast It is reposing the most sacred trust in him from the moment he receives it he becomes guarantee to the people for the safety of their dearest rights and cannot neglect or betray them without criminality If he acts the faithful servant his wages will be precious for he will be paid with the love of his country  Whatever my ability be it shall be exerted in your service no private views of interest or ambition should influence the servant of the people he should drop  self  and all the meanness of its dependant passions and feel think and act only for the good and prosperity of the commonweal If chosen by your free voices I pledge myself to act upon this broad scale of honour and truth and though my talents may want splendor to dazzle in my country's cause the integrity of my heart shall remain its incorruptible champion  Mob  Huzza Belfield for ever Belfield for ever  Geo  Oh if I could speak like that fellow  Par  It's all over I seehe spoke like an angel  Geo  Uncle what shall I do now  Par  Decline the poll for I'm sure you have no chance of being returned this bout  Mrs Hig  Oh disgraceful he shall stand his ground and if it's only to run them to expences we'll have a scrutiny  Geo  Mr Cryer my uncle says I must decline the poll and so you may bawl out if you please  George  whispers the Sheriff as if declining the poll  Cryer  Silence One Candidate having declined the poll the sheriff has declared Richard Belfield  Esq  and Roderic O'Shannon  Esq  duly elected  Mob  Huzza huzza huzza  The  Candidates  come from the Hustings  Geo Falls on his knees  Oh uncle won't you forgive me and I'll speak better next time  Par  Out of my sight you dog never come into my house  Geo  Then I'm turned out of both houses the parliment house and my uncle's house  Par  Mr Belfield I wish you joy of your election Nay believe me I am sincere your excellent talents have made a convert of me  Bel  Sir you overwhelm me with surprize and pleasure  Par  I'll dine with you today  Bel  You'll be the chief guest dear sir  Par  And you shall dine with me tomorrow and by the union of your and Letitia's interest have a son that deserves to sit in parliament  Mrs High  What then is my son insulted slighted and cast off  Geo  What then am I to be forsaken  Mrs High  Come my young Roman  Geo  I am no young RomanI am an old Englishman so come along mother for my friend Goose has got another borough cut out for me  Exeunt  George  and  Mrs Highflight  Par  I wonder what the devil bewitched me as to suppose that great calf my nephew could ever cut a sigure as a public speaker But Belfield give me your hand which here I join with Letitia's and  thus make atonement for my follymy crime I should rather say for to attempt imposing on the people an incapable representative is high treason against the constitution  FINALE  Par  Thus may Freedom still make known  That in England's cause she fights  And the peoples' voice alone  Choose the guardians of their rights  Leti  Ah day of joy that chases fear  And heals this peaceless bosom's smart  Thy morn's return I'll hail each year  With sacrifices from my heart  Goose  The suit is spoilt for all our wit  But what avails this noise and pother  If one borough will not fit  We'll take his measure for another  Exeunt omnes  THE END
