 CLARISSA OR THE HISTORY OF A YOUNG LADY Comprehending The most  Important Concerns  of  Private LIFE  And particularly shewing The DISTRESSES that may attend the Misconduct Both of PARENTS and CHILDREN In Relation to MARRIAGE Published by the  EDITOR  of  PAMELA  VOL II  LONDON  Printed for S Richardson And Sold by A MILLAR overagainst  Catharinestreet  in the  Strand  J and JA RIVINGTON in  St Paul's Churchyard  JOHN OSBORN in  Paternoster Row  And by J LEAKE at  Bath  MDCCXLVIII  THE HISTORY OF Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE VOL II  LETTER I Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Wednesday Night March  _ANGRYWhat should I be angry forI am mightily pleased with your freedom as you call it I only wonder at your patience with me that's all I am sorry I gave you the trouble of so long a letter upon the occasion  See Letter  XXXVII  in the preceding Volume for the occasion And Letters  XXXVIII XL  in the same for the freedoms Miss Harlowe apologizes for  notwithstanding the pleasure I received in reading it  I believe you did not intend reserves to me For two reasons I believe you did not First because you  say  you did not Next because you have not  as yet  been able to convince  yourself  how it is to be  with you and persecuted as you are how so to separate the effects that spring from the two causes  Persecution  and  Love  as to give to each its particular due But this I believe I hinted to you once before And so will say no more upon that subject at present  Robin says you had but just deposited your last parcel when he took it For he was there but half an hour before and found nothing He had seen my impatience and loiter'd about being willing to bring me something from you if possible  My cousin Jenny Fynnett is here and desires to be my bedfellow tohight So I shall not have an opportunity to sit down with that seriousness and attention which the subjects of yours require For she is all prate you know and loves to set me a prating Yet comes upon a very grave occasionOn purpose to procure my mamma to go with her to her grandmother Larkin who has been long bedridden and at last has taken it into her head that she is mortal and therefore will make her will a work she was till now extremely averse to but it must be upon condition that my mamma who is her distant relation will go to her and advise her as to the particulars of it For she has a high opinion as every one else has of my mamma's judgment in all matters relating to wills settlements and suchlike notable affairs  Mrs Larkin lives about seventeen miles off and as my mamma cannot abide to lie out of her own house she proposes to set out early in the morning in order to get back again at night So tomorrow I shall be at your devotion from daylight to daylight nor will I be at home to anybody  As to the impertinent man I have put him upon escorting the two ladies in order to attend my mamma home at night Such expeditions as these and to give our sex a little air of vanity and assuredness at public places is all that I know these dangling fellows are good for  I have hinted before that I could almost wish my mamma and Mr Hickman would make a match of it And I here repeat my wishes What signifies a difference of fifteen or twenty years especially when the Lady has spirits that will make her young a long time and the gentleman is a  mighty  sober manI think verily I could like him better for a papa than for a nearer relation And they are strange admirers of one another  But allow me a perhaps still better and as to  years  more suitable and happier disposal for the  man  at leastWhat think you my dear of compromizing with your friends by rejecting  both  your men and encouraging my paraderIf your liking of one of the two go no farther than  conditional  I believe it will doA rich thought if it obtain your approbation In this light I should have a prodigious respect for Mr Hickman more by half than I can have in the other The vein is open'dShall I let it flowHow difficult to withstand constitutional foibles  Hickman is certainly a man more in your taste than any of those who have hitherto been brought to address you He is mighty sober mighty grave and all that Then you have told me that he is your favouriteBut that is because he is my mamma's perhapsThe man would certainly rejoice at the transfer Or he must be a greater fool than I take him to be  O but your fierce lover would knock him o' the headI forgot thatWhat makes me incapable of seriousness when I write about this HickmanYet the man so good a sort of man in the mainBut who is perfect This is one of my foibles And something for you to chide me for  You believe me very happy in my prospects in relation to him Because you are so very unhappy in the foolish usage you meet with you are apt as I suspect to think that tolerable which otherwise would  be far from being so I dare say you would not with all your grave airs like him for yourself except being addressed by Solmes and him you were obliged to have one of them I have given you a test let me see what you'll say to it  For my own part I confess to you that I have great exceptions to Hickman  He  and  wedlock  never yet once enter'd into my head at one time Shall I give you my free thoughts of himOf his  best  and his  worst  and that as if I were writing to one who knows him not I think I will Yet it is impossible I should do it gravely The subject won't bear to be so treated in my opinion We are not come so far as that yet if ever we shall And to do it in another strain ill becomes my present real concern for you  HERE I was interrupted on the honest man's account He has been here these two hourscourting my mamma for her daughter I supposeYet she wants no courting neither Tis well one of us does else the man would have nothing but halcyon and be remiss and saucy of course  He was going His horses at the door  My mamma sent for me down pretending to want to say something to me  Something she said when I came that signify'd nothingEvidently for no reason called me but to give me an opportunity to see what a fine bow he could make and that he might wish me a goodnight She knows I am not overready to oblige him with my presence if I happen to be otherwise engag'd I could not help an air a little upon the fretful when I found she had nothing of moment to say to me and when I saw her end  She smiled off the visible fretfulness that the man might go away in good humour with himself  He bow'd to the ground and would have taken my hand his whip in the other I did not like to  be so companion'd I withdrew my hand but touched his elbow with a motion as if from his low bow I had supposed him falling and would have help'd him up A sad slip it might have been said I  A mad girl smil'd it off my mamma  He was put quite out took his horsebridle stump'd back back back bowing till he run against his servant I laughed he mounted his horse rid away I mounted up stairs after a little lectureAnd my head is so filled with him that I must resume my intention in hopes to divert you for a few moments  Take it thenHis  best  and his  worst  as I said before  Hickman is a sort of fiddling busy yet to borrow a word from you  un  busy man Has a great deal to do and seems to me to dispatch nothing Irresolute and changeable in every thing but in teazing me with his nonsense which yet it is evident he must continue upon my mamma's interest more than his own hopes for none have I given him  Then I have a quarrel against his face though in his person for a wellthriven man tolerably genteelNot to his features so much neitherFor what as you have often observed are features in a manBut Hickman with strong lines and big cheek and chin bones has not the manliness in his aspect which Lovelace has with the most regular and agreeable features  Then what a set and formal mortal is he in some thingsI have not been able yet to laugh him out of his long bib and beads Indeed that is because my mamma thinks it becomes him and I would not be so free with him as to own I should  choose  to have him leave it off If he did so particular is the man he would certainly if left to himself fall into a KingWilliamCravat or some such antique chincushion as by the pictures of that Prince one sees was then the fashion  As to his dress in general he cannot indeed be  called a sloven but sometimes he is too gaudy at other times too plain to be uniformly elegant And for his manners he makes such a bustle with them and about them as would induce one to suspect that they are more strangers to him than familiars You I know lay this to his fearfulness of disobliging or offending Indeed your  Overdoes  generally give the offence they endeavour to avoid  The man however is honest Is of family Has a clear and good estate and may one day be a Baronet and please you He is humane and benevolent tolerably generous as people say and as  I  might say too if I would accept of his bribes which he offers in hopes of having them all back again and the  bribed  into the bargain A method taken by all corruptors from old Satan to the lowest of his servantsYet to speak in the language of a person I am bound to honour he is deemed a  prudent  man that is a  good manager    Then I cannot say that now I like anybody better whatever I did once  He is no foxhunter Keeps a pack indeed but prefers not his hounds to his fellowcreatures No bad sign for a wife I own Loves his horse but dislikes racing in a gaming way as well as all sorts of gaming Then he is sober modest They  say  virtuous in short has qualities that mothers would be fond of in a husband for their daughters and for which perhaps their daughters would be the happier could they judge as well for themselves as experience possibly may teach  them  to judge for their  future  daughters  Nevertheless to own the truth I cannot say I love the man nor ever shall I believe  Strange that these sober fellows cannot have a decent sprightliness a modest assurance with them Something debonnaire which need not be separated from that awe and reverence when they address a  woman which should shew the ardor of their passion rather than the sheepishness of their nature for who knows not that Love delights in taming the Lyonhearted That those of the sex who are most conscious of their own defect in point of courage naturally  require  and therefore  as  naturally  prefer  the man who has most of it as the most able to give them the requisite protection That the greater their own cowardice as it would be called in a man the greater is their delight in subjects of heroism As may be observed in their reading which turns upon difficulties encounter'd battles fought and enemies overcome or by the prowess of one single hero the  more  improbable the  better  In short that  their  man should be a hero to every one living but themselves and to them know no bound to his humility A woman has some glory in subduing a heart no man living can appall and hence too often the bravo assuming the hero and making himself pass for one succeeds as only a hero should  But as for honest Hickman the good man is so  generally  meek as I imagine that I know not whether I have any  preference  paid me in his obsequiousness And then when I rate him he seems to be so naturally fitted for rebuke and so much expects it that I know not how to disappoint him whether he just then deserve it or not I am sure he has puzzled me many a time when I have seen him look penitent for faults he has not committed whether to pity or laugh at him  You and I have often  retrospected  the faces and minds of grown people that is to say have formed images from their present appearances outside and in as far as the manners of the persons would justify us in the latter what sort of figures they made when boys and girls And I'll tell you the lights in which Hickman Solmes and Lovelace our three heroes have appeared to me supposing them boys at school  Solmes I have imagin'd to be a little sordid pilfering rogue who would purloin from everybody and beg every boy's bread and butter from him while as I have heard a reptile brag he would in a wintermorning spit upon his thumbs and spread his own with it that he might keep it all to himself  Hickman a great overgrown lankhair'd chubby boy who would be hunch'd and punch'd by everybody and go home with his finger in his eye and tell his mother  While Lovelace I have supposed a curlpated villain full of fire fancy and mischief an orchardrobber a wallclimber a horserider without saddle or bridle neck or nothing A sturdy rogue in short who would kick and cuff and do no right and take no wrong of anybody would get his head broke then a plaister for it or let it heal of itself while he went on to do more mischief and if not to get to deserve broken bones And the same dispositions have grown up with them and distinguish the men with no very material alteration  Only that all men are monkeys more or less or else that you and I should have such baboons as these to choose out of is a mortifying thing my dear  I am sensible that I am not a little out of season in treating thus ludicrously the subject I am upon while you are so unhappy and if my manner does not divert you as my flightinesses used to do I am inexcusable both to you and to my own heart Which I do assure you notwithstanding my seeming levity is wholly in your case  As this letter is intirely whimsical I will not send it until I can accompany it with something more solid and better suited to your unhappy circumstances that is to say to the present subject of our correspondence Tomorrow as I told you will be wholly yours and of consequence your  ANNA HOWE'S  LETTER II Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday Morn o'Clock  MY mamma and cousin are already gone off in our chariot and four attended by their doughty 'Squire on horseback and he by two of his own servants and one of my mamma's They both love parade when they go abroad at least in compliment to one another which shews that each thinks the other does Robin is your servant and mine and nobody's else And the day is all my own  I must begin with blaming you my dear for your resolution not to litigate for your right if occasion were to be given you Justice is due to one's self as well as to everybody else Still more must I blame you for declaring to your aunt and sister that you will  not  Since as they will tell it to your father and brother the declaration must needs give advantages to spirits who have so little of that generosity for which you yourself are so much distinguished  There never was a spirit in the world that would insult where it  dared  but it would creep and cringe where it dared  not  Let me remind you of a sentence of your own the occasion for which I have forgotten  'That little Spirits will always accommodate themselves to the subject they would work uponWill sawn upon a sturdytemper'd person Will insult the meek'  And another given to Miss Biddulph upon an occasion you cannot forget  'If we assume a dignity in what we say and do and take care not to disgrace by arrogance our own assumption everybody will treat us with respect and deference'  I remember that you once made an observation which you said you was obliged to Mrs Norton for and she to her father upon an excellent preacher  who was but an indifferent liver  'That to excell in theory and to excell in practice generally required different talents which not always met in the same person'  Do you my dear to whom theory and practice are the same thing in almost every laudable quality apply the observation to yourself in this particular case where Resolution is required and where performance of the will of the defunct is the questionNo more to be dispensed with by  you  in whose favour it was made than by anybody else who have only Themselves in view by breaking thro' it  I know how much you despise riches in the main But yet it behoves you to remember that in one instance you yourself have judged them valuable  'In that they put it into one's power to  lay  obligations while the want of them puts a person under a necessity of  receiving  favours receiving them perhaps from grudging and narrow spirits who know not how to confer them with that grace which gives the principal merit to a beneficent action'  Reflect upon this my dear and see how it agrees with the declaration you have made to your aunt and sister that you would not resume your estate were you to be turned out of doors and reduced to indigence and want Their very fears that you will resume point out to you the  necessity  of resuming upon the treatment you meet with  I own that I was much affected at first reading with your mamma's letter sent with the patternsA strange measure however from a mother for  she  did not intend to insult you and I cannot but lament that so sensible and so fine a Lady should stoop to so much art as that letter is written with And which also appears in some of the conversations you have given me an account of See you not in her passiveness what boistrous spirits can obtain from gentler merely by teazing and illnature  I know the pride they have always taken in calling you an Harlowe  Clarissa Harlowe  so  formal  and so  set  at every word when they are grave or proudly solemnYour mamma has learnt it of themAnd as in  marriage  so in  will  has been taught to bury her own superior name and family in theirs I have often thought that the same spirit govern'd them in this piece of affectation and others of the like nature as  Harlowe  Place and soforth tho' not the elder brother's or paternal seat as govern'd the tyrant Tudor  Henry  VII  who marrying Elizabeth the Heiress of the House of York made himself a title to a throne which he would not otherwise have had being but a base descendant of the Lancaster Line and proved a gloomy and vile husband to her for no other cause than because she had laid him under obligations which his pride would not permit him to ownNor would the unprincely wretch marry her till he was in possession of the crown that he might not be supposed to owe it to her claim  You have chidden me and again will I doubt not for the liberties I take with some of your relations But my dear need I tell  you  That pride in  ourselves  must and forever will provoke contempt and bring down upon us abasement from  others  Have we not in the case of a celebrated Bard observed that those who aim at more than their due will be refused the honours that they may justly claimI am very loth to offend you yet I cannot help speaking of  them  as well as of  others  as I think they deserve  Praise  or  Dispraise  is the Reward or Punishment which the world confers or inflicts on  Merit  or  Demerit  and for my part I neither can nor will confound them in the application I despise them All but your mamma Indeed I doAnd as for herBut I will spare the good Lady for your sakeAnd one argument indeed I think may be pleaded in her favour  in the present contentionShe who has for so many years and with such absolute resignation borne what she has borne to the sacrifice of her own will may think it an easier task than another person can imagine it for her daughter to give up  her  'sBut to think to whose instigation all this is originally owingGod forgive me but with such usage I should have been with Lovelace before nowYet remember my dear that the step which would not be wonder'd at from such an hastytemper'd creature as me would be inexcusable in such a considerate person as you  After your mamma has been thus drawn in against her judgment I am the less surprised that your aunt Hervey should go along with her since the two sisters never separate I have inquired into the nature of the obligation which Mr Hervey's indifferent conduct in his affairs has laid him underIt is only it seems that your brother has paid off for him a mortgage upon one part of his estate which the mortgagee was about to foreclose and taken it upon himself A small favour as he has ample security in his hands from kindred to kindred But such a one it is plain as has laid the whole family of the Herveys under obligation to the ungenerous lender who has treated him and his aunt too as Miss Dolly Hervey has privately complain'd with the less ceremony ever since  Must I my dear call such a creature your  brother  I believe I mustBecause he is your  father  's  son  There is no harm I hope in saying That  I am concerned that you ever wrote at all to him It was taking too much notice of him It was adding to his selfsignificance and a call upon him to treat you with insolence A call which you might have been assured he would not fail to answer  But such a pretty master as this to run riot against such a man as Lovelace who had taught him to put his sword into his scabbard when he had pulled it  out by accidentThese indoor insolents who turning themselves into bugbears frighten women children and servants are generally cravens among men Were he to come fairly cross me and say to my face some of the free things which I am told he has said of me behind my back or that as by your account he has said of our sex I would take upon myself to ask him two or three questions altho' he were to send me a challenge likewise  I repeat You know that I will speak my mind and  write  it too He is not  my  brother Can you say he is  yours  So for your life if you are just you can't be angry with me For would you side with a  false brother  against a  true friend  A brother may  not  be a friend But a friend will be  always  a brother  Mind That  as your uncle  Tony  says  I cannot descend so low as to take very particular notice of the epistles of those poor souls whom you call  uncles  Yet I love to divert myself with such grotesque characters tooBut I know  them  and love  you  and so cannot make the jest of them which their absurdities call for  Now I have said so much on these  touching  topics as I am but too sensible you will think them I must add one reflection more and so intitle myself to your correction for all at onceIt is upon the conduct of those women for you and I know more than  one  such who can suffer themselves to be outbluster'd and outgloom'd till they have no  will  of their own instead of being prevailed upon by acts of tenderness and complaisance to be  fooled out of it  I wish that it does not demonstrate too evidently that with some of the sex insolent controul is a more efficacious subduer than kindness or concessionUpon my life my dear I have often thought that many of us are mere babies in matrimony Perverse fools when too much indulg'd and humour'd creeping slaves when treated harshly But shall it be said that  fear  makes us more gentle obligers than  love  Forbid it honour forbid it gratitude forbid it justice that any woman of sense should give occasion to have this said of her  Did I think you would have any manner of doubt from the style or contents of this letter whose saucy pen it is that has run on at this rate I would write my name at length since it comes too much from my heart to disavow itBut at present the initials shall serve and I will go on again directly  A H  LETTER III Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday morn o' clock Mar  I Will postpone or perhaps pass by several observations which I had to make on other parts of your letters to acquaint you that Mr Hickman when in London found an opportunity to inquire after Mr Lovelace's townlife and conversation  At the Cocoatree in Pallmall he fell in with two of his intimates the one named Belton the other Mowbray very free of speech and rakish gentlemen both But the waiter it seems paid them great respect and on his inquiry after their characters called them men of fortune and honour  They began to talk of Mr Lovelace of their own accord and upon some gentlemen in the room asking when they expected him in town answer'd That very day Mr Hickman as they both went on praising Lovelace said He had indeed heard that Mr Lovelace was a very fine gentlemanand was proceeding when one of them interrupting him saidOnly Sir the finest gentleman in the world that's all  And so he led them on to expatiate more particularly on his qualities which they were very fond of  doing But said not one single word in behalf of his morals  Mind that  also in your uncle's style  Mr Hickman said That Mr Lovelace was very happy as he understood in the esteem of the Ladies and smiling to make them believe he did not think amiss of it that he push'd his good fortune as far as it would go  Well put Mr Hickman thought I equally grave and sageThou seemest not to be a stranger to their dialect as I suppose this isBut I said nothing for I have often try'd to find out this  mighty  sober man of my mamma's But hitherto have only to say that he is either very moral or very cunning  No doubt of it reply'd one of them and out came an oath with a Who would notThat he did as every young gentleman would  Very true said my mamma's puritanBut I hear he is in treaty with a fine lady  So he was Mr Belton saidThe dI fetch her Vile brute for she ingrossed all his timeBut that the Lady's family ought to besomethingMr Hickman desired to be excused repeating whattho' he had repeated what was worseand might dearly repent their usage of a man of his family and merit  Perhaps they may think him too wild a gentleman cry'd Hickman And theirs is I hear a very sober family  SOBER said one of them A good honest word DickWhere the devil has it lain all this timeDme if I have heard of it in this sense ever since I was at college And then said he we bandy'd it about among twenty of us as an obsolete  There's for you my dear  These are Mr Lovelace's companions You'll be pleased to take  notice of that  Mr Hickman said this put him out of countenance  I stared at him and with such a meaning in my  eyes as he knew how to take and so was out of countenance again  Don't you remember my dear who it was that told a young gentleman designed for the gown who own'd he was apt to be too easily put out of countenance when he came among free company  'That it was a bad sign that it looked as if his morals were not proof but that his good disposition seemed rather the effect of accident and education than of such a choice as was founded upon principle'  And don't you know the lesson the very same young Lady gave him  'To endeavour to stem and discountenance vice and to glory in being an advocate in all companies for virtue'  particularly observing  'That it was natural for a man to shun or give up what he was ashamed of'  Which she should be sorry to think his case on this occasion Adding  'That vice was a coward and would hide its head when opposed by such a virtue as had presence of mind and a full persuasion of its own rectitude to support it'  The Lady you may remember modestly put her doctrine into the mouth of a worthy preacher Dr Lewin as she uses to do when she has a mind not to be thought to be what she is at so early an age and that it may give more weight to anything  she hit upon that might appear tolerable  was her modest manner of speech  Mr Hickman upon the whole professed to me upon his  second recovery  that he had no reason to think well of Mr Lovelace's morals from what he heard of him in town Yet his two intimates talked of his being  more regular  than he  used to be  That he had made a very good resolution  That  of old Tom Wharton was the expression That he would never  give  a challenge nor  refuse  one which they praised in him highly That in short he was a very brave fellow and the charming'st companion in the world  And would one day make a great figure in his country for there was nothing he was not capable of  I am afraid that this is too true And this my dear is all that Mr Hickman could pick up about him And is it not enough to determine such a mind as yours if not  already  determined  Yet it must be said too that if there be a woman in the world that can reclaim him it is you And by your account of his behaviour in the interview between you I own I have some hope of him At least This I will say That all his arguments with you then seem to be just and right And if you  are  to be hisBut no more of That▪ He cannot after all deserve you  LETTER IV Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday afternoon March  AN unexpected visitor has turned the course of my thoughts and chang'd the subject I had intended to pursue The only one for whom I would have dispensed with my resolution not to see anybody all the dedicated day A visitor whom according to Mr Hickman's report from the expectations of his libertine friends I supposed to be in townNow my dear have I saved myself the trouble of telling you That it was your tooagreeable Rake Our sex is said to love to trade in surprizes Yet have I by my overpromptitude surprised myself out of mineI had intended you must know to run twice the length before I had suffer'd you so much as to guess who and of which sex my visitor was But since you have the discovery at so cheap a rate you are welcome to it  The end of his coming was to engage my interest with my  charming friend  and as he was sure that I  knew all your mind to acquaint him what he had to trust to He mentioned what had passed in the interview between youBut could not be satisfy'd with the result of it and with the little satisfaction he had obtained from you the malice of your family to him increasing and their cruelty to you not abatingHis heart he told me was in tumults for fear you should be prevailed upon in favour of a man despised by everybody He gave me fresh instances of indignities cast upon himself by your uncles and brother and declared that if you suffered yourself to be forced into the arms of the man for whose sake he was loaded with undeserved abuses you should be one of the youngest as you would be one of the loveliest widows in England And that he would moreover call your brother to account for the liberties he takes with his character to everyone he meets with  He proposed several schemes for you to choose some one of them in order to enable you to avoid the persecutions you labour under One I will mention That you will resume your estate and if you find difficulties that can be no otherwise surmounted that you will either avowedly or privately as he had proposed to you accept of his aunt Lawrance's or Lord M's assistance to instate you in it He declared that if you did he would leave it absolutely to your own pleasure afterwards and to the advice which your cousin Morden on his arrival should give you whether to encourage his address or not as you shall be convinced of the sincerity of the reformation which his enemies make him so much want  I had now a good opportunity to sound him as you wish'd Mr Hickman would Lord M as to the continued or diminished favour of the Ladies and of his Uncle towards you upon their being acquainted with the animosity of your relations to them as well as to their kinsman I took the opportunity and he satisfy'd me by reading some passages of a letter he had  about him from Lord M That an alliance with you and that on the foot of your own single merit would be the most desirable event to them that could happen And so far to the purpose of your wished inquiry does his Lordship go in this letter that he assures him that whatever you suffer in fortune from the violence of your relations on  his  account he and his sisters will join to make it up to him And yet the reputation of a family so splendid would no doubt in a case of such importance to the honour of both make them prefer a general consent  I told him as you yourself I knew had done that you were extremely averse to Mr Solmes and that might you be left to your own choice it would be the Single Life As to himself I plainly said That you had great and just objections to him on the score of his careless morals That it was surprising that young gentlemen who gave themselves the liberties he was said to take should presume to think that whenever they took it into their heads to marry the most virtuous and worthy of the sex were to fall to their lot That as to the Resumption it had been very strongly urged by myself and would be more tho' you had been averse to it hitherto That your chief reliance and hopes were upon your cousin Morden And that to suspend or gain time till he arrived was as I believed your principal aim  I told him That with regard to the mischief he threatened neither the act nor the menace could serve any end but theirs who persecuted you as it would give them a pretence for carrying into effect their compulsatory projects and that with the approbation of all the world since he must not think the public would give its voice in favour of a violent young man of no extraordinary character as to morals who should seek to rob a family of eminence of a child so valuable and who threatened if he could not obtain her in preference to a man chosen by themselves that  he would avenge himself upon them All by acts of violence  I added That he was very much mistaken if he thought to intimidate  you  by such menaces For that tho' your disposition was all sweetness yet I knew not a steadier temper in the world than yours nor one more inflexible as your friends had found and would still farther find if they continued to give occasion for its exertion whenever you thought yourself in the right and that you were dealt ungenerously with in matters of too much moment to be indifferent about Miss Clarissa Harlowe Mr Lovelace let me tell you said I timid as her foresight and prudence may make her in some cases where she apprehends dangers to those she loves is above fear in points where her honour and the true dignity of her sex are concernedIn short Sir you must not think to frighten Miss Clarissa Harlowe into such a mean or unworthy conduct as only a weak or unsteady mind can be guilty of  He was so very far from intending to intimidate you he said that he besought me not to mention one word to you of what had passed between us That what he had hinted at that carried the air of a menace was owing to the fervor of his spirits raised by his apprehensions of losing all hope of you for ever and on a supposition that you were to be actually forced into the arms of a man you hated That were this to be the case he must own that he should pay very little regard to the world or its censures Especially as the menaces of some of your family now and their triumph over him afterwards would both provoke and warrant all the vengeance he could take  He added that all the countries in the world were alike to him but on your account So that whatever he should think fit to do were you lost to  him  he should have nothing to apprehend from the Laws of this  I did not like the determined air he spoke this with He is certainly my dear capable of great rashness  He palliated a little this fierceness which by the way I warmly censured by saying That while you remain single he will bear all the indignities that shall be cast upon him by your family But would you throw yourself if you werer still farther driven into any other protection if not his uncle's or that of the ladies of his family into my mamma's suppose or would you go to London to private lodgings where he would never visit you unless he had your leave and from whence you might make your own terms with your relations he would be intirely satisfy'd and would as he had said before wait the effect of your cousin's arrival and your free determination as to his own fateAdding That he knew the family so well and how much fixed they were upon their measures as well as the absolute dependence they made upon your temper and principles that he could not but apprehend the worst while you remained in the power of their persuasion and menaces  We had a great deal of other discourse But as the reciting of the rest would be but a repetition of many of the things that passed between you and him in the interview between you in the woodhouse I refer myself to your memory on that occasion  See Vol  I  Letter  xxxvi    And now my dear upon the whole I think it behoves you to make yourself independent All then will fall right This man is a violent man I should wish methinks that you should not have either him or Solmes You will find if you get out of your brother's and sister's way what you  can  or can  not  do with regard to either If your relations persist in their foolish scheme I think I will take his hint and at a proper opportunity sound my mamma Mean time let me have your clear opinion of and reasonings upon the Resumption which I join with Lovelace in advising You can but see how your demand will work To  demand  is not to  litigate  But be  your resolution what it will do not by any means repeat that you will not assert your right If they go on to give you provocation you may have sufficient reason to change your mind And let them expect that you  will  change it They have not the generosity to treat you the better for disclaiming the power they know you have  That  I think need not now be told you  I am my dearest friend and will be ever  Your most affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE  LETTER V Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Wedn Night March  ON my aunt's and sister's report of my obstinacy my assembled relations have taken an  unanimous  resolution as Betty tells me it is against me This resolution you will find signify'd to me in the inclosed letter from my brother just now brought me Be pleased to return it when perused I may have occasion for it in the altercations between my relations and me  Miss  CLARY    I AM commanded to let you know that my father and uncles having heard your aunt Hervey's account of all that has passed between her and you Having heard from your sister what sort of treatment she has had from you Having recollected all that has passed between your mamma and you Having weighed all your pleas and proposals Having taken into consideration their engagements with Mr Solmes that gentleman's patience and great affection for you and the little opportunity you have given yourself to be acquainted either with his merit or his proposals Having considered two points more to wit The wounded authority of  a father and Mr Solmes's continual intreaties little as you have deserved regard from him that you may be freed from a confinement to which he is desirous to attribute your perverseness to him  averseness  I should have said but let it go he being unable to account otherwise for so strong a one supposing you told truth to your mamma when you asserted that your heart  was free  and which Mr Solmes is willing to believe tho' nobody else doesFor all these reasons it is resolved that you shall go to your uncle Antony's And you must accordingly prepare yourself so to do You will have but short notice of the day for obvious reasons  I will honestly tell you the motive for your going It is a double one first That they may be sure that you shall not correspond with anybody they do not like for they find from Mrs Howe that by some means or other you  do  correspond with her daughter and thro' her perhaps with somebody else And next That you may receive the visits of Mr Solmes which you have thought fit to refuse to do here by which means you have deprived yourself of the opportunity of knowing  whom  and  what  you have hitherto refused  If after one fortnight's conversation with Mr Solmes and after you have heard what your friends shall further urge in his behalf unharden'd by clandestine correspondencies you shall convince them that Virgil's  amor omnibus idem  for the application of which I refer you to the Georgic as translated by Dryden is verify'd in you as well as in the rest of the animal creation and that you cannot or will not forego your prepossession in favour of the moral the virtuous the pious Lovelace I would please you if I could it will then be considered whether to humour you or to renounce you for ever  It is hoped that as you  must  go you will go chearfully Your uncle Antony will make everything at his house agreeable to you But indeed he  won't promise that he will not at  proper times  draw up the bridge  Your visitors besides Mr Solmes will be myself if you permit me that honour your sister and as you behave to Mr Solmes your aunt Hervey and your uncle Harlowe and yet the two latter will hardly come neither if they think it will be to hear your  whining vocatives  Betty Barnes will be your attendant And I must needs tell you Miss that we none of us think the worse of the faithful maid for your dislike of her Which Betty however who would be glad to oblige you laments as a misfortune  Your answer is required whether you  chearfully  consent to go And your indulgent mamma bids me remind you from her That a fortnight's visits from Mr Solmes are all that is meant at present  I am as you shall be pleased to deserve  Yours c JAMES HARLOWE jun  So here is the masterstroke of my brother's policy Called upon to consent to go to my uncle Antony's  avowedly  to receive Mr Solmes's visitsA chapelA moated houseDeprived of the opportunity of corresponding with youor of any possibility of escape should violence be used to compel me to be that odious man's  Late as it was when I received this insolent letter I wrote an answer to it directly that it might be ready for the writer's time of rising I inclose the rough draught of it You will see by it how much his vile hint from the Georgic and his rude one of my  whining vocatives  have set me up Besides as the command to get ready to go to my uncle's is in the name of my father and uncles it is but to shew a piece of the art they accuse me of to resent the vile hint I have so much reason to resent in order to palliate the refusal of obeying what would otherwise  be interpreted an act of rebellion by my brother and sister For it seems plain to me that they will work but half their ends if they do not deprive me of my father's and uncles favour altho' I should even comply with terms which it is impossible I should ever comply with  YOU might have told me Brother in three lines what the determination of my friends was only that then you would not have had room to display your pedantry by so detestable an allusion or reference to the Georgic Give me leave to tell you Sir That if  humanity  were a branch of your studies at the University it has not found a genius in you for mastering it Nor is either my Sex or my self tho' a sister I see intitled to the least decency from a brother who has studied as it seems rather to cultivate the malevolence of his natural temper than any tendency which one would have hoped his parentage if not his education might have given him to a tolerable politeness  I doubt not that you will take amiss my freedom But as you have deserved it from me I shall be less and less concerned on that score as I see you are more and more intent to shew your wit at the expence of justice and compassion  The time is indeed come that I can no longer bear those contempts and reflections which a brother least of all men is intitled to give And let me beg of you one favour officious SirIt is  this  That you will not give yourself any concern about a husband for  me  till I shall have the forwardness to propose a wife to  you  Pardon me Sir but I cannot help thinking that could I have the art to  get my papa  of my side I should have as much right to prescribe for you as you have for me  As to the communication you make me I must take upon me to say That altho' I will receive as  becomes me any of my papa's commands yet as this signification is made me by a brother who has shewn of late so much of an unbrotherly animosity to me for no reason in the world that I know of but that he believes he has in me  one  sister too many for his interest I think myself intitled to conclude that such a letter as you have sent me is all your ownAnd of course to declare that while I so think it I will not willingly nor even without violence go to any place avowedly to receive Mr Solmes's visits  I think myself so much intitled to resent your infamous hint and this as well for the sake of my Sex as for my own that I ought to declare as I do that I will not receive any more of your letters unless commanded to do so by an authority I never will dispute except in a case where I think my  future  as well as  present  happiness concernedAnd were such a case to happen I am sure my father's harshness will be less owing to himself than to you and to the specious absurdities of your ambitious and selfish schemesVery true Sir  One word more provoked as I am I will add That had I been thought as really obstinate and perverse as of late I am said to be I should not have been so disgracefully treated as I have beenLay your hand upon your heart Brother and say By whose instigationsAnd examine what I have done to deserve to be made thus unhappy and to be obliged to style myself  Your injured Sister CL HARLOWE  When my dear you have read my answer to this letter tell me what you think of meIt  shall go    LETTER VI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Thursday Morning Mar  MY letter has set them  all  in tumults For it seems none of them went home last night and they all were desired to be present to give their advice if I should refuse compliance with a command thought so reasonable as it seems this was  Betty tells me That at first my father in a rage was for coming up to me himself and for turning me out of his doors directly Nor was he restrained till it was hinted to him that That was no doubt my wish and would answer all my perverse views But the result was That my brother having really as my mamma and aunt insisted taken wrong measures with me should write again in a more  moderate  manner For nobody else was permitted or cared to write to such a  ready scribbler  And I having declared that I would not receive any more of his letters without command from a superior authority my mamma was to give it  hers  And accordingly has done so in the following lines written on the superscription of his letter to me Which letter also follows Together with my reply  Clary Harlowe  RECEIVE and read This with the temper that becomes your sex your character your education and your duty And return an answer to it directed to your brother  CHARLOTTE HARLOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday Morning  ONCE more I write altho' imperiously prohibited by a younger sister Your mamma will have me do so that you may be destitute of all defence if you persist in your  pervicacy  Shall I be a  pedant  Miss for this word She is willing to indulge in you the least appearance of that delicacy for which she once as well as everybody else admired youBefore you knew Lovelace I cannot however help saying  that  And she and your aunt Hervey will have it They would fain favour you if they could that I may have provoked from you the answer they nevertheless own to be so exceedingly  unbecoming  I am now learning you see to take up the softer language where you have laid it down This then is the case  They  intreat  they  pray  they  beg  they  supplicate  Will either of these do Miss Clary That you will make no scruple to go to your uncle Antony's And fairly I am to tell you for the very purpose mentioned in my lastor 'tis presumable they need not  intreat pray beg supplicate  Thus much is promised to Mr Solmes who is your advocate and very uneasy that you should be under constraint supposing that your dislike to him arises from That▪ And if he finds you are not to be moved in his favour when you are absolutely freed from That you call a  controul  he will forbear thinking of you whatever it costs him He loves you too well And in this I really think his understanding which you have reflected upon is to be questioned  Only for one fortnight therefore permit his visits Your  Education  you tell me of  mine  you know ought to make you incapable of rudeness to anybody He will not I hope be the first man myself excepted whom you ever treated rudely purely because  he is esteemed by us all I am what you have a mind to make me Friend Brother or ServantI wish I could be still  more  polite to so polite so delicate a Sister  JA HARLOWE  You must still write to  me  if you condescend to reply Your mamma will not be permitted to be disturbed with your nothingmeaning Vocatives  Vocatives  once more Madam Clary repeats the  pedant  your brother  To  JAMES HARLOWE  jun  Esq  Thursday March  PERMIT me my everdear and honoured papa and mamma in this manner to surprise you into an  audience  presuming This will be read to you since I am deny'd the honour of writing to you directly Let me beg of you to believe that nothing but the most unconquerable dislike could make me stand against your pleasure What are riches what are settlements to happiness Let me not thus cruelly be given up to a man my very soul is averse to Permit me to repeat that I cannot  honestly  be his Had I a slighter notion of the matrimonial duty than I have perhaps I might But when I am to bear all the misery and That for  life  when my  heart  is less concerned in this matter than my  soul  my  temporal  perhaps than my  future  good why should I be deny'd the liberty of  refusing  That liberty is all I ask  It were easy for me to give way to hear Mr Solmes talk for the mentioned fortnight altho' it is impossible for me say what he would to get over my dislike to him But the Moated house the Chapel there and the little mercy my brother and sister who are to be there have hitherto shewn me are what I  am extremely apprehensive of And why does my brother say my restraint is to be taken off and that too at Mr Solmes's desire when I am to be a still closer prisoner than before the Bridge threaten'd to be drawn up and no dear papa and mamma near me to appeal to in the last resort  Transfer not I beseech you to a brother and sister your own authority over your childTo a brother and sister who treat me with unkindness and reproach and as I have too much reason to apprehend misrepresent my words and behaviour or greatly favour'd as I used to be it is impossible I should be sunk so low in your opinions as I unhappily am  Let but this my hard my disgraceful confinement be put an end to Permit me my dear mamma to pursue my Needleworks in your presence as one of your maidens and you shall be witness that it is not wilfulness or prepossession that governs me Let me not however be put out of your own house Let Mr Solmes come and go as my papa pleases Let me but tarry or retire when he comes as I can and leave the rest to Providence  Forgive me Brother that thus with an appearance of art I address myself to my father and mother to whom I am forbid to approach or to write Hard it is to be reduced to such a contrivance Forgive likewise the plaindealing I have used in the above with the nobleness of a gentleman and the gentleness due from a brother to a sister Altho' of late you have given me but little room to hope for your favour or compassion yet having not deserved to forfeit  either  I presume to claim  both  For I am confident it is at present much in your power altho' but my brother my honoured parents both I bless God in being to give peace to the greatly disturbed mind of  Your unhappy Sister CL HARLOWE  Betty tells me my brother has taken my letter all in pieces and has undertaken to write such an answer to it as shall confirm the  wavering  So it is plain that I should have moved somebody by it but for this hardhearted brother God forgive him  LETTER VII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Thursday Nighty Mar  I Send you the boasted confutationletter just now put into my handsMy brother and sister my uncle Antony and Mr Solmes are I understand exulting over the copy of it below as an unanswerable performance  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    ONCE again my inflexible sister I write to you▪ It is to let you know that the pretty piece of art you found out to make me the vehicle of your whining pathetics to your father and mother has not had the expected effect  I do assure you that your behaviour has not been misrepresented Nor need it Your mamma who is sollicitous to take all opportunities of putting the favourablest constructions upon all you do has been forced as you well know to give you up upon full proof No need then of the expedient of pursuing your Needleworks in her sight She cannot bear your whining pranks And it is for  her  sake that you are not permitted to come into her presence nor will be but upon her own terms  You had like to have made a simpleton of your aunt Hervey yesterday She came down from you pleading in your favour But when she was asked  What concession she had brought you to she look'd about her and knew not what to answer So your mamma when surprised into the beginning of your cunning address to her and to your papa under my name for I had begun to read it little suspecting such an  ingenious  subterfuge and would then make me read it thro' wrung her hands Oh her dear child her dear child must not be so compelledBut when she was asked Whether she would be willing to have for her Soninlaw the man who bids defiance to her whole family and who had like to have murder'd her son And what concessions she had gain'd from her beloved to occasion this tenderness And that for one who had apparently deceived her in assuring her that her heart was free then could she look about her as her sister had done before Then was she again brought to herself and to a resolution to assert her authority not to  transfer  it witty presumer over the rebel who of late has so ingratefully struggled to throw it off  You seem child to have a high notion of the matrimonial duty and I'll warrant like the rest of your sex one or two whom I have the honour to know excepted that you will go to church to promise what you will never think of afterwards But  sweet  child as your  worthy  mamma Norton calls you think a little less of the  matrimonial  at least till you come into that state and a little more of the  filial  duty  How can you say you are to bear  all the misery  when you give so large a share of it to your parents to your uncles to your aunt to myself and to your sister who all for Eighteen years of your life loved you so well  If of late I have not given you room to hope for my favour or compassion it is because of late you have not deserved either I know what you mean little reflecting fool by saying it is much in my  power altho'  but  your brother a very slight degree of relation with you to give you that peace which you can give yourself whenever you please  The liberty of  refusing  pretty Miss is deny'd you because we are all sensible that the liberty of  choosing  to every one's dislike must follow The vile wretch you have set your heart upon speaks This plainly to everybody tho' you won't He says you are  His  and  shall  be  His  and he will be the death of any man who robs him of his PROPERTY So Miss we have a mind to try this point with him My father supposing he has the right of a father in his child is absolutely determin'd not to be bully'd out of that right And what must that child be who prefers the Rake to a Father  This is the light in which this whole debate ought to be taken Blush then Delicacy that cannot bear the Poet's  Amor omnibus idem  Blush then Purity Be ashamed Virgin modesty And if capable of conviction surrender your whole will to the will of the honoured pair to whom you owe your being And beg of all your friends to forgive and forget the part you have of late acted  I have written a longer letter than ever I designed to write to you after the insolent treatment and prohibition you have given me And now I am commission'd to tell you that your friends are as weary of confining you as you are of being confin'd And therefore you must prepare yourself to go in a very few days as you have been told before to your uncle Antony's who notwithstanding your apprehensions will draw up his bridge when he pleases will see what company he pleases in his own house nor will he demolish his chapel to cure you of your foolish latecommenc'd antipathy to a place of Divine WorshipThe more foolish as if we intended to use force we could have the ceremony pass in your chamber as well as any where else  Prejudice against Mr Solmes has evidently blinded you and there is a  charitable  necessity to open your eyes Since no one but you thinks the gentleman so contemptible in his  person  nor for a plain country gentleman who has too much solid sense to appear like a coxcomb justly blameable in his  manners  And as to his  temper  it is necessary you should speak upon fuller knowlege than at present it is plain you can have of him  Upon the whole it will not be amiss that you prepare for your speedy removal as well for the sake of your own conveniency as to shew your readiness in  one  point at least to oblige your friends one of whom you may if you please to deserve it reckon tho'  but  a Brother  JAMES HARLOWE  P S  If you are disposed to see Mr Solmes and to make some excuses to him for your past conduct in order to be able to meet him  somewhere else  with the less concern to yourself for your freedoms with him he shall attend you where you please If you have a mind to read the settlements before they are read to you for your signing they shall be sent you upWho knows but they will help you to some fresh objectionsYour heart is  free  you knowIt  must  For did you not tell your mother it was And will the  pious  Clarissa Harlowe fib to her mamma  I desire no reply The case requires none Yet I will ask you Have you Miss no more proposals to make  I was so vexed when I came to the end of this letter the postscript to which perhaps might be written after the rest had seen the letter that I took up my pen with an intent to write to my uncle Harlowe about resuming my own estate in pursuance  of your advice But my heart failed me when I recollected that I had not one friend to stand by or support me in my claim and that it would but the more incense them without answering any good end O that my cousin were but come  Is it not a sad thing beloved as I thought myself so lately by every one that now I have not one person in the world to plead for me to stand by me or who would afford me refuge were I to be under the necessity of seeking for itI who had the vanity to think I had as many friends as I saw faces and flatter'd myself too that it was not altogether unmerited because I saw not my Maker's Image either in man woman or child high or low rich or poor whom comparatively I loved not as myselfWould to heaven my dear that you were marry'd Perhaps then you could have induc'd Mr Hickman upon my application to afford me protection till these storms were overblown But then this might have involv'd  him  in difficulties and dangers and that I would not have had done for the world  I don't know what to do not IGod forgive me but I am very impatientI wishbut I don't know what to wish without a sinYet I wish it would please God to take me to his mercyI can meet with none hereWhat a world is this What is there in it desireable The good we hope for so strangely mix'd that one knows not what to wish for And one half of mankind tormenting the other and being tormented themselves in tormentingFor here in this my particular case my relations cannot be happy tho' they make me unhappyExcept my brother and sister indeedand they seem to take delight in and enjoy the mischief they make  But it is time to lay down my pen since my ink runs nothing but gall  LETTER VIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Friday Morning Six o'Clock  MRS Betty tells me there is now nothing talked of but of my going to my uncle Antony's She has been order'd she says to get ready to attend me thither And upon my expressing my averseness to go had the confidence to say That having heard me often praise the  romanticness  of the place she was  astonish'd  her hands and eyes lifted up that I should set myself against going to a house so much in  my taste    I asked if this was her own insolence or her young mistress's observation  She halfastonish'd me by her answer That it was hard she could not say a  good  thing without being robbed of the merit of it  As the wench looked as if she really thought she had said a good thing without knowing the boldness of it I let it pass But to say the truth this creature has surprised me on many occasions with her smartness For since she has been imploy'd in this controuling office I have discover'd a great deal of wit in her assurance which I never suspected before This shews that insolence is her talent and that Fortune in placing her as a servant to my sister has not done so kindly by her as Nature for that she would make a better figure as her  companion  And indeed I can't help thinking sometimes that I myself was better fitted by  Nature  to be the servant of  both  than the  mistress  of the  one  or the  sister  of the  other  And within these few months past  Fortune  has acted by me as if she were of the same mind  Friday Ten o'Clock  Going down to my Poultryyard just now I heard my brother and sister and that Solmes laughing and triumphing together The high Yew Hedge between us which divides the yard from the garden hinder'd them from seeing me  My brother as I found had been reading part or the whole perhaps of the copy of his last letterMighty prudent and consistent you'll say with their views to make me the wife of a man from whom they conceal not what were I to be such it would be kind in them to endeavour to conceal out of regard to my future peace But I have no doubt that they hate me heartily  Indeed you was up with her there brother said my sister You need not have bid her not write to you I'll engage with all her wit she'll never pretend to answer it  Why indeed said my brother with an air of Collegesufficiency with which he abounds for he thinks nobody writes like himself I believe I have given her a  choakpear  What say you Mr Solmes  Why Sir said he I think it is unanswerable But will it not exasperate her more against me  Never fear Mr Solmes said my brother but we'll carry our point if she do not tire  you  out first We have gone too far in this method to recede Her cousin Morden will soon be here so all must be over before that time or she'll be made independent of us all  There Miss Howe is the reason given for their Jehudriving  Mr Solmes declar'd that he was determin'd to persevere while my brother gave him any hopes and while my father stood firm  My sister told my brother that he  hit me charmingly  on the reason why I ought to converse with  Mr Solmes But that he should not be so smart upon the  sex  for the faults of  this perverse girl    Some lively and I suppose witty answer my brother return'd for he and Mr Solmes laugh'd outrageously upon it and Bella laughing too call'd him a naughty gentleman But I heard no more of what they said they walking on into the garden  If you think my dear that what I have related did not again fire me you will find yourself mistaken when you read at this place the inclosed copy of my letter to my brother struck off while the iron was redhot  No more call me meek and gentle I beseech you  To Mr  JAMES HARLOWE    Friday Morning  SIR  IF notwithstanding your prohibition I should be silent on occasion of your last you would perhaps conclude that I was consenting to go to my uncle Antony's upon the condition you mention My father must do as he pleases with his child He may turn me out of his doors if he thinks fit or give  you  leave to do it but loth as I am to say it I should think it very hard to be carry'd by force to anybody's house when I have one of  my own  to go to  Far be it from me notwithstanding your's and my sister's provocations to think of taking my estate into my own hands without my papa's leave But why if I must not stay any longer here may I not be permitted to go thither I will engage to see nobody they would not have me see if this favour be permitted  Favour  I call it and am ready to receive and acknowlege it as such altho' my grandfather's will has made it matter of right  You ask me in a very unbrotherly manner in the postscript to your letter if I have not some new proposals  to make I HAVE since you put the question three or four  New ones  all I think tho' I will be so bold as to say that submitting the case to any one impartial person whom  you  have not set against me my  old  ones ought not to have been rejected I  think  This why then should I not  write  itNor have you any more reason to storm at your  sister  for telling it you since you seem in your letter to make it your boast how you turned my mamma and my aunt Hervey against me than I have to be angry with my  brother  for treating me as no brother ought to treat a sister  These are my new proposals then  That as above I may not be hinder'd from going to reside under such conditions as shall be prescribed to me which I will most religiously observe at my grandfather's late house I will not again in this place call it  mine  I have reason to think it a great misfortune that ever it was so  Indeed  I have  If this be not permitted I desire leave to go for a month or for what time shall be thought fit to Miss Howe's I dare say her mamma will consent to it if I have my papa's permission to go  If this neither be allowed and I  am  to be turned out of my father's house I beg I may be suffer'd to go to my aunt Hervey's where I will inviolably observe her commands and those of my papa and mamma  But if this neither is to be granted it is my humble request that I may be sent to my uncle Harlowe's instead of my uncle Antony's I mean not by this any disrespect to my uncle Antony But his Moat with his Bridge threaten'd to be drawn up and perhaps his Chapel terrify me beyond expression notwithstanding your  witty  ridicule upon me for that apprehension  If this likewise be refused and I must be carried to the Moated house which used to be a delightful one  to me let it be promised me that I shall not be compelled to receive Mr Solmes's visits there and then I will as chearfully go as ever I did  So here Sir are my new proposals And if none of them answer your end as each of them tends to the exclusion of that ungenerous persister's visits be pleased to know that there is no misfortune I will not submit to rather than yield to give my hand to the man to whom I can allow no share in my heart  If I write in a style different from my usual and different from what I wished to have occasion to write an impartial person who knew what I have accidentally within this hour past heard from your mouth and my sister's and a third person's particularly the reason you give for driving on at this violent rate to wit my cousin Morden's soonexpected arrival would think I have but too much reason for it Then be pleased to remember Sir that when my  whining vocatives  have subjected me to so much scorn and ridicule it is time were it but to  imitate  examples so excellent as  you  and my  sister  set me that I should endeavour to assert my character in order to be thought less an  alien  and  nearer of kin to you both  than either of you have of late seemed to suppose me  Give me leave in order to  empty my female quiver  at once to add that I know no other reason you can have for forbidding me to reply to you after you have written what you pleased to me than that you are conscious you cannot answer to reason and to justice the treatment you give me  If it be otherwise I an unlearned unlogical girl younger by near a third than yourself will venture so assured am I of the justice of my cause to put my fate upon an issue with  you  With  you  Sir who have had the advantage of an academical education whose mind must have been strengthen'd by observation and learned conversation and who pardon  my going so  low  ▪ have been accustomed to give  choakpears  to those you vouchsafe to write against  Any impartial person your late Tutor for instance or the pious and worthy Dr Lewin may be judge between us And if either give it against me I will promise to resign to my destiny Provided if it be given against you that my father will be pleased only to allow of my negative to the person so violently sought to be imposed upon me  I flatter myself Brother that you will the readier come into this proposal as you seem to have a high opinion of your talents for argumentation and not a  low  one of the cogency of the arguments contained in your last letter And as I can possibly have no advantage in a contention with you if the justice of my cause affords me not any as you have no opinion it will it behoves you methinks to shew to an impartial moderator that  I  am wrong and  you  not so  If this be accepted there is a necessity for its being carry'd on by the pen the facts to be stated and agreed upon by both and the decision to be given according to the force of the arguments each shall produce in support of their side of the question For give me leave to say I know too well the  manliness  of your temper to offer at a  personal  debate with you  If it be not accepted I shall conclude that you cannot defend your conduct towards me And shall only beg of you that for the future you will treat me with the respect due to a sister from a brother who would be thought as polite as learned  And now Sir if I have seem'd to shew some spirit not quite foreign to the relation I have the honour to bear to  you  and to my  sister  and which may be deem'd not altogether of a piece with that part of my character which once it seems gained me every one's love be pleased to consider to  whom  and to  what  it is owing and that this part of that character was not dispensed with till it subjected me to that scorn  and those insults which a brother who has been  so tenacious of an independence  that I  voluntarily  gave up and who has appeared  so exalted  upon it ought not to have shewn to  anybody  much less to a  weak  and  defenceless  sister Who is notwithstanding an affectionate and respectful one and would be glad to shew herself to be so upon all future occasions as she has in every action of her past life altho' of late she has met with such unkind returns  CL HARLOWE  See the force and volubility as I may say of passion for the letter I send you is my first draught struck off without a blot or erazure  Friday Three o' Clock  AS soon as I had transcribed it I sent it down to my brother by Mrs Betty  The wench came up soon after all aghast with her  Lord Miss  What  have  you doneWhat  have  you written For you have set them all in a  joyful  uproar  MY Sister is but this moment gone from me She came up all in a flame which obliged me abruptly to lay down my pen She run to me  O Spirit said she tapping my neck a little  too  hard And is it come to this at last  Do you beat me Bella  Do you call this beating you Only tapping your shoulder  thus  said she tapping again more gentlyThis is what we expected it would come toYou want to be independentMy papa has lived too long for you  I was going to speak with vehemence but she put her handkerchief before my mouth very rudelyYou have done enough with your pen mean listener as you are But know that neither your independent  scheme nor any of your visiting ones will be granted you Take your course perverse one call in your Rake to help you to an  in  dependence upon your parents and a dependence upon himDo soPrepare this momentResolve what you will take with youTomorrow you goDepend upon it tomorrow you goNo longer shall you tarry here watching and creeping about to hearken to what people say'Tis determin'd childYou go tomorrowMy brother would have come up to tell you soBut I persuaded him to the contraryFor I know not what had become of you if he hadSuch a letterSuch an insolent such a  conceited  challengerO thou vain creatureBut prepare your self I sayTomorrow you goMy brother will accept your bold challenge but it must be  personal  and at my uncle Antony'sOr perhaps at Mr Solmes's  Thus she ran on almost foaming with passion till quite out of patience I said No more of your violence BellaHad I known in what a way you would come up you should not have found my chamberdoor openTalk to your servant in this manner Unlike  you  as I bless God I am I am nevertheless your sisterAnd let me tell you that I won't go tomorrow nor next day nor next day to thatexcept I am dragg'd away by violence  What not if your papa or your mamma commands itGirl said she intending another word by her pause and manner before it came out  Let it come to  that  BellaThen I shall know what to sayBut it shall be from either of their own mouths if I doNot from yours nor your Betty'sAnd say another word to me in this manner and be the consequence what it may I will force myself into their presence and demand what I have done to be used thus  Come along childCome along meekness  taking my hand and leading me towards the doorDemand it of them nowYou'll find  both  your despised parents togetherWhat does your heart fail youfor I resisted being thus insolently led and pulled my hand from her  I want not to be led said I and since I can plead your invitation I will go And was posting to the stairs accordingly in my passionBut she got between me and the door and shut it  Let me first bold one apprise them of your visitFor your own sake let meFor my brother is with them But yet opening it again seeing me shrink backGo if you willWhy don't you goWhy don't you go Missfollowing me to my closet whither I retired with my heart full and pulled the sashdoor after me and could no longer hold in my tears  Nor would I answer one word to her repeated aggravations and demands upon me to open my door for the key was on the inside nor so much as turn my head towards her as she looked thro' the glass at me And at last which vex'd her to the heart I drew the silk curtain that she should not see me and down she went muttering all the way  Is not this usage enough to provoke one to a rashness one had never thought of committing  As it is but too probable that I may be hurry'd away to my uncle's without being able to give you previous notice of it I beg that as soon as you shall hear of such a violence you will send to the usual place to take back such of your letters as may not have reached my hands or to fetch any of mine that may be there May you my dear be always happy prays your▪  CL HARLOWE  I have received your four letters But am in such a ferment that I cannot at present write to them  LETTER IX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Friday Night March  I Have a most provoking letter from my sisterI might have supposed she would resent the contempt she brought upon herself in my chamber Her conduct surely can only be accounted for by the rage of a supposed rivalry  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    I Am to tell you That your mamma has begg'd you off for the morrowBut that you have effectually done your business with her as well as with everybody else  In your proposals and letter to your brother you have shew'd yourself so silly and so wise so young and so old so gentle and so obstinate so meek and so violent that never was there so mix'd a character  We all know of whom you have borrowed this new spirit And yet the seeds of it must be in your heart or it could not all at once shew itself so rampant It would be doing Mr Solmes a spight to wish him such a  shy un  shy girl another of your contradictory qualitiesI leave you to make out what I mean by it  Here  Miss your mamma will not let you remain She cannot have any peace of mind while such a rebel of a child is so near her Your aunt Hervey will not take a charge all the family put together cannot manage Your uncle Harlowe will not see you at his house till you are marry'd So thanks to your own stubbornness you have nobody that will receive you but your uncle Antony Thither yon must go in a very few days and when there your brother will settle with you in my presence all that relates to  your modest challengeFor it is accepted I will assure you Dr Lewin will possibly be there since you make choice of him  Another  gentleman likewise were it but to convince you that he is another sort of man than you have taken him to be Your two uncles will  possibly  be there too to see that the  poor weak  and  defenceless sister  has fair play So you see Miss what company your smart challenge will draw together  Prepare for the day You'll soon be called upon  Adieu mamma Norton's sweet child  ARAB HARLOWE  I transcrib'd this letter and sent it to my mamma with these lines  A very few words my everhonour'd Mamma  IF my sister wrote the inclosed by my father's direction or yours I must submit to the usage with this  only  observation That it is short of the personal treatment I have received from her If it be of her own headWhy then MadamBut I  knew  that when I was banish'd from your presenceYet till I know if she has or has not authority for this usage I will only write further that I am  Your  very  unhappy Child  CL HARLOWE  This answer I receiv'd in an open slip of paper but it was wet in one place I kiss'd the place for I am sure it was blister'd as I may say with a mother's tearThe dear Lady must I  hope  she must have wrote it reluctantly  TO apply for protection where authority is defy'd is boldYour sister who would not in  your  circumstances have been guilty of  your  perverseness may allowably be angry at you for itHowever  we have told her to moderate her  zeal  for our insulted authority See if you can deserve another behaviour than That which cannot be so grievous to  you  as the  cause  of it is to  Your  more  unhappy Mother    How often must I forbid you any address to me  GIVE me my dearest friend your opinion what I  can  what I  ought  to do Not what you would do push'd as I am push'd in  resentment  or  passion  for in  That  spirit you tell me you should have been with somebody before nowAnd steps made in passion hardly ever fail of leading to repentance But acquaint me with what you think cool judgment and afterreflection whatever be the event will justify  I doubt not your  sympathizing  love But yet you cannot possibly feel indignity and persecution so very sensibly as the immediate sufferer feels them Are  fitter  therefore to advise me than I am myself  I will here rest my cause Have I or have I not suffer'd or borne enough And if they will still persevere if that strange persister against an antipathy so strongly avow'd will  still  persist say What  can  I doWhat course pursueShall I fly to London and endeavour to hide myself from Lovelace as well as from all my own relations till my cousin Morden arrives Or shall I embark for Leghorn in my way to my cousin Yet my Sex my Youth consider'd how full of danger is

three last stanza's of it as not unsuitable to my unhappy situation and after I had reperused the Ode those three were my lesson And I am sure in the solemn address they contain to the Allwise and Allpowerful Deity my heart went with my fingers  I inclose the Ode and my Effort with it The subject is solemn My circumstances are affecting and I flatter myself that I have not been quite unhappy in

Midnight  I Have now a calmer moment Envy Ambition high and selfish Resentment and all the violent Passions are now most probably asleep all around me and shall not my own angry ones give way to the silent hour and subside likewiseThey  have  given way to it and I have made use of the gentler space to reperuse your last letters I will touch upon some passages in them And that I may the less endanger the but justrecovered calm I will begin with what you write about Mr Hickman  Give me leave to say That I am sorry you cannot yet persuade yourself to think better that is to say  more justly  of that gentleman than your whimsical picture of him shews you do or at least than the humorousness of your natural vein would make one  think  you do  I do not imagine that you yourself will say he sat for the picture you have drawn And yet upon the whole it is not greatly to his disadvantage Were I at ease in my mind I would venture to draw a much more amiable and just likeness  If Mr Hickman has not that assurance which some men have he has that humanity and gentleness which many want And which with the infinite value he has for you will make him one of the properest husbands in the world for a person of your vivacity and spirit  Altho' you say I would not like him myself I do assure you if Mr Solmes were such a man as Mr Hickman in person mind and behaviour my friends and I had never disagreed about him if they would not have permitted me to live single Mr Lovelace  having such a character as he has would have stood no chance with me This I can the more boldly aver because I plainly perceive that of the two passions  Love  and  Fear  This man will be able to inspire one with a much greater proportion of the  latter  than I imagine is compatible with the  former  to make a happy marriage  I am glad you own that you like no one better than Mr Hickman In a little while I make no doubt you will be able if you challenge your heart upon it to acknowlege that you like not any man so well Especially when you come to consider that the very faults you find in Mr Hickman admirably fit him to make  you  happy That is to say If it be necessary to your happiness that you should have your own will in every thing  But let me add one thing And that is thisYou have such a sprightly turn that with your admirable talents you would make any man in the world who loved you look like a fool except he were such a one as Lovelace  Forgive me my dear for my frankness And forgive me also for so soon returning to subjects so immediately relative to myself as those I now must touch upon  You again insist strengthen'd by Mr Lovelace's opinion upon my assuming my own estate And I have given you room to expect that I will consider this subject more closely than I had done beforeI must however own that the reasons that I had to offer against your advice were so obvious that I thought you would have seen them yourself and been determin'd by them against your own hastier counselBut since this has not been so and that both you and Mr Lovelace call upon me to assume my own estate I will enter briefly into the subject  In the first place let me ask you my dear supposing I were inclined to follow your advice Whom  have I to support me in my demandMy uncle Harlowe is one of my trustees He is against me My cousin Morden is the other He is in Italy and may be set against me too My brother has declar'd that they are resolved to carry their point before he arrives So that as they drive on all will probably be decided before I could have an answer from him were I to write And confined as I am if the answer were to come in time and they did not like it they would keep it from me  In the next place parents have great advantages in every eye over the child if she dispute their pleasure in the disposing of her And so they ought Since out of twenty instances perhaps two could not be produced where  they  were not in the right the  child  in the wrong  You would not I am sure have me accept of Mr Lovelace's offer'd assistance in such a claim If I would embrace any  other  person's who else would care to appear for a child against parents ever till of late so affectionate But were such a protector to be found what a length of time would it take up in a course of litigationThe Will and the Deeds have flaws in them they say My brother sometimes talks of going to reside at  The Grove  I suppose with a design to make ejectments necessary were I to offer at assuming or should I marry Lovelace in order to give him all the opposition and difficulty the Law would help him to give  These cases I have put to myself for argumentsake But they are all out of the question altho' anybody  were  to be found who would espouse my cause For I do assure you I would sooner beg my bread than litigate for my right with my papa Since I am convinc'd that whether or not the parent do his duty by the child the child cannot be exempted from doing hers to him And to go to law with my  Father  what a sound has That You will see that I have  mention'd my wish as an alternative and as a favour to be permitted if I  must  be put out of his house to go thither But not one step further can I go And you see how This is resented  Upon the whole then what have I to hope for but a change in my father's resolution And is there any probability of that such an ascendency as my brother and sister have obtained over everybody and such an interest to pursue the enmity they have now openly avow'd against me  As to Mr Lovelace's approbation of your assumptionscheme I wonder not at it He very probably penetrates the difficulties I should have to bring it to effect without his assistance Were I to find myself as free as I would wish myself to be perhaps that man would stand a worse chance with me than his vanity may permit him to imagine notwithstanding the pleasure you take in raillying me on his account How know you but all that appears to be specious and reasonable in his offersSuch as standing his chance for my favour after I became independent as I may call it by which I mean no more than having the liberty to refuse a man in that Solmes whom it hurts me but to think of as a husband and such as his not visiting me but by my leave and till Mr Morden came and till I were satisfy'd of his reformationHow know you I say that he gives not himself these airs purely to stand better in  your  graces as well as  mine  by offering of his own accord conditions which he must needs think would be insisted on were the case to happen  Then am I utterly displeased with him To threaten as he threatensYet to pretend that it is not to intimidate me and to beg of you not to tell me when he must know you  would  and no doubt must  intend  that you  should  is so meanly artfulThe man must think he has a frighted fool to deal withI to join hands with such a man of violenceMy own brother  the man he threatensAnd Mr SolmesWhat has Mr Solmes done to himIs  he  to be blamed if he thinks a person would make a wife worth having to endeavour to obtain herOh that my friends would but leave me to my own way in this one pointFor have I given the man encouragement sufficient to ground these threats upon Were Mr Solmes a man to whom I could be but indifferent it might be found that to have the merit of a sufferer given him from such a flaming spirit would very little answer the views of that flaming spiritIt is my fortune to be treated as a fool by my brother But Mr Lovelace shall findYet I will let  him  know my mind and then it will come with a better grace to your knowlege  Mean time give me leave to tell you that it goes against me in my cooler moments wicked as my brother is to me to have you my dear who are  myself  as it were write such very severe reflections upon him in relation to the advantage Lovelace had over him He is not indeed  your  brother But you write to  his  sister rememberUpon my word Miss you dip your pen in gall whenever you are offended And I am almost ready to question when I read some of your expressions against others of my relations as well as him altho' in my favour whether you are so thoroughly warranted by  your own  patience as you think yourself to call  other  people to account for  their  warmth Should we not be particularly careful to keep clear of the faults we censureAnd yet I am so angry at both my brother and sister that I should not have taken this liberty with my dear friend notwithstanding I know you  never  loved them had you not made so light of so shocking a transaction where a brother's life was at stake Where his credit in the eye of the mischievous sex has received a still deeper wound than he  personally  sustained and when a revival of the  same wicked resentments which may end more fatally is threaten'd  His credit I say in the eye of the  mischievous Sex  Who is not warranted to call it so when it is reckon'd among the men such an extraordinary piece of selfconquest as the two libertines his companions gloried to resolve never to  give  a challenge and among whom duelling is so fashionable a part of brutal bravery that the man of temper who is mostly I believe the truly brave man is often at a great loss how to behave in some cases to avoid incurring either a mortal guilt or a general contempt  To inlarge a little upon this subject may we not infer That those who would be guilty of throwing these contempts upon a man of temper for avoiding a greater evil know not the measure of true magnanimity Nor how much nobler it is to  forgive  and even how much more  manly  to  despise  than to  resent  Were I a man methinks I should have too much scorn for a person who could wilfully do me a mean injury to put a value upon his life equal to what I put upon my own What an absurdity Because a man had done me a  small  injury that I should put it in his power at least to an  equal  risque to do me and those who love me an irreparable oneWere it not a  wilful  injury nor  avow'd  to be so there could not be  room  for resentment  How willingly would I run away from myself and what most concerns myself if I could This digression brings me back again to the occasion of itAnd That to the impatience I was in when I ended my last letter for my situation is not alter'd I renew therefore my former earnestness as the new day approaches and will bring with it perhaps new tryals that you will as undivestedly as possible of favour or resentment tell me what you would have me doFor if I am obliged to go to my uncle Antony's  All I doubt will be over with me Yet how to avoid itThat's the difficulty  I shall deposite this the first thing When you have it lose no time I pray you to advise lest it be too late  Your everobliged CL HARLOWE  LETTER XI Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Sat March  WHAT  can  I advise you my noble creature Your merit is your crime You can no more change  your  nature than your persecutors can  theirs  Your distress is owing to the vast disparity between you and them What would you have of them Do they not act in characterAnd to whom To an Alien You are not one of themThey have two dependenciesUpon their own  impenetrableness  one I'd give it a properer name if I dared the other on the regard you have always had for your  character  Have they not heretofore own'd as much and upon your apprehensions from  that  of Lovelace which would discredit you should you take any step by his means to extricate yourself Then they know that resentment and unpersuadableness are not natural to you and that the anger they have wrought you up to will subside as all  extraordinaries  soon do and that once marry'd you'll make the best of it  But surely your  father  's eldest son and eldest daughter have a view to intail unhappiness for life upon you were you to have the man who is already more nearly related to them than ever he can be to you should the shocking compulsion take place by communicating to so narrow a soul all they know of your just aversion to him  As to that wretch's perseverance those only who know not the man will wonder at it He has not the least delicacy When  ever  he shall marry his view will not be for mind How should it He has  not  a mind And does not  Like seek its Like  And if it finds something beyond itself how shall that be valued which cannot be comprehended Were you to be his and shew a visible want of tenderness to him it is my opinion he would not be much concerned at it since that would leave him the more at liberty to pursue those sordid attachments which are predominant in him I have heard you well observe from your Mrs Norton That a person who has any  overruling  passion will compound by giving up twenty  secondary  or  under  satisfactions tho' more laudable ones in order to have  that  gratify'd  I'll give you the substance of a conversation no fear you can be made to like him worse than you do already that passed between Sir Harry Downeton and this Solmes but three days ago as Sir Harry told it but yesterday to my mamma and me It will confirm to you that what your sister's insolent Betty reported he should say of governing by fear was not of her own head  Sir Harry told him he wonder'd he should hope to carry you so much against your inclination as everybody knew it would be if he did  He matter'd not That he said Coy maids made fond wives A sorry fellow It would not at all grieve him to see a pretty woman make wry faces if she gave him cause to vex her And your estate by the convenience of its situation would richly pay him for all he could bear with your shyness  He should be sure after a while of your complaisance at least if not of your love And in That should be happier than nine parts in ten of his marry'd acquaintance  What a wretch is this  For the rest your known virtue would be as great a security to him as he could wish for  She will look upon you said Sir Harry who is a reader if she be forced to marry you as Elizabeth of France did upon Philip II of Spain when he received her on his frontiers as her husband who  was  to have been but her fatherinlaw That is with fear and terror rather than with complaisance and love And you will perhaps be as surly to her as That old Monarch was to  his  bride  Terror and Fear the wretch the horrid wretch said looked pretty in a bride as well as in a wife And laughing yes my dear the hideous fellow laughed immoderately as Sir Harry told us when he said it It should be his care to perpetuate the occasion for that  fear  if he could not think he had the  love  And for his part he was of opinion that if LOVE and FEAR must be separated in matrimony the man who made himself  feared  fared best  If my eyes would carry with them the execution which the eyes of the Basilisk are said to do I would make it my first business to see this creature  My mamma however says it would be a prodigious merit in you if you could get over your aversion to him Where asks she as you have been ask'd before is the praiseworthiness of obedience if it be only paid in instances where we give up nothing  What a fatality that you have no better an optionEither a  Scylla  or a  Charybdis  Were it not YOU I should know how barbarously used as you are used to advise you in a moment But such a noble character to suffer from a supposed rashness and indiscretion of such a nature would be a wound to the Sex as I have heretofore observed  While I was in hope that the asserting of your own independence would have helped you I was pleased that you had  one  resource as I thought But  now that you have so well proved that such a step would not avail you I am intirely at a loss what to say I will lay down my pen and think  I HAVE considered and considered again but I protest I know no more what to say than before Only this That I am young like yourself and have a much weaker judgment and stronger passions than you have  I have heretofore said that you have offer'd as much as you ought to offer in living single If you Were never to marry the estate they are so loth should go out of their name would in time I suppose revert to your brother And  he  or  his  would have it perhaps much more certainly this way than by the precarious reversions Solmes makes them hope for Have you put this into their odd heads my dearThe tyrant word AUTHORITY as they use it can be the only objection against this offer  One thing you must consider that if you leave your parents your duty and love to them will not suffer you to appeal against them to justify yourself for so doing and so you'll have the world against you And should Lovelace continue his wild life and behave ungratefully to you how will That justify their conduct to  you  which nothing  else  can as well as their resentments against  him  May heaven direct you for the best I can only say that for my own part I would do anything go anywhither rather than be compelled to marry the man I hate and were he such a man as  Solmes  must always hate Nor could I have borne what you have borne if from father and uncles not from brother and sister  My mamma will have it that after they have try'd their utmost efforts to bring you into their measures and find them ineffectual they will recede But I  cannot say I am of her mind She does not own she has any other authority for this but her own conjecture I should otherwise have hoped that your uncle Antony and she had been in one secret and that favourable to youWoe be to one of them at least your uncle I mean if they should be in  any other  You must if possible avoid being carried to that uncle's The man the parson the chapel your brother and sister presentthey'll certainly there marry you to Solmes Nor will your newlyraised spirit support you in your resistance on such an occasion Your meekness will return and you will have nothing for it but tears tears despised by them all and ineffectual appeals and lamentationsAnd  these  when the ceremony is  profaned  as I may say you must suddenly put a stop to and dry up And endeavour to dispose yourself to such an humble frame of mind as may induce your newmade Lord to forgive all your past declarations of aversion  In short my dear you must then blandish him over with a confession that all your past behaviour was maidenly reserve only And it will be  your  part to convince him of the truth of his impudent sarcasm  That the coyest maids make the fondest wives  Thus will you begin the state with a high sense of obligation to his  forgiving goodness  And if you will not be kept to it by that  fear  he proposes to govern by I am much mistaken  Yet after all I must leave the point undetermin'd and only to  be  determin'd as you find they recede from their avowed purpose or resolve to remove you to your uncle Antony's But I must repeat my wishes that something may fall out that  neither  of these men may call you  his  And may you live single my dearest friend till some man shall offer that may be as worthy of you as man  can  be  But yet methinks I would not that you who  are so admirably qualify'd to adorn the matrimonial state should be always single You know I am incapable of flattery and that I always speak and write the sincere dictates of my heart Nor can you from what you must know of your own merit taken in a comparative light with others doubt my sincerity For why should a person who delights to find out and admire every thing that is praiseworthy in  another  be supposed ignorant of like perfections in  herself  when she could not so much admire them  in  another if she had them  not  herself And why may not one give  her  those praises which  she  would give to any other who had but half of her own excellenciesEspecially when she is incapable of pride and vainglory and neither despises others for the want of her fine qualities nor overvalues herself upon them  Over  values did I sayHow can that be  Forgive me my beloved friend My admiration of you increased as it is by every letter you write will not always be held down in silence altho' in order to avoid offending you I generally endeavour to keep it from flowing to my pen when I write to you or to my lips whenever I have the happiness to be in your company  I will add nothing tho' I could an hundred things on occasion of your latest communications but that I am  Your everaffectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE  I hope I have pleased you with my dispatch I wish I had been able to please you with my requested advice  You have given new beauties to the charming Ode which you have transmitted to me What pity that the wretches you have to deal with put  you out of your admirable course in the pursuit of which like the sun you was wont to chear and illuminate all you shone upon  LETTER XII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sunday Morning Mar  HOW soothing a thing is praise from those we loveWhether conscious or not of deserving it it cannot but give us great delight to see one's self stand high in the opinion of those whose favour we are ambitious to cultivate An ingenuous mind will make this farther use of it that if it be sensible that it does not  already  deserve the charming attributes it will hasten before its friend finds herself mistaken to obtain the graces it is complimented for And this it will do as well in honour to itself as to preserve its friend's opinion and justify her judgmentMay This be always my aimAnd then you will not only give the  praise  but the  merit  and I shall be more worthy of that friendship which is the only pleasure I have to boast of  Most heartily I thank you for the kind dispatch of your last favour How much am I indebted to you and even to your honest servantUnder what obligations does my unhappy situation lay me  But let me answer the kind contents of it as well as I may  As to getting over my disgusts to Mr Solmes it is impossible to be done while he wants Generosity Frankness of Heart Benevolence Manners and every qualification that distinguishes a worthy man O my dear what a degree of patience what a greatness of soul is required in the wife not to despise a husband who is more ignorant more illiterate more lowminded than herselfThe wretch vested  with prerogatives who will claim rule in virtue of them and not to  permit  whose claim will be as disgraceful to the  prescribing  wife as to the  govern'd  husband How shall such a husband as This be borne were he for reasons of  convenience  and  interest  even to be one's CHOICE But to be  compelled  to have such a one and that compulsion to arise from motives as unworthy of the  prescribers  as of the  prescribed  who can think of getting over an aversion so justly founded How much easier to bear the  temporary  persecutions I labour under  because  temporary than to resolve to be  such  a man's for  life  Were I to comply must I not leave my relations and go to him  One month  will decide the one perhaps But what a  duration of woe  will the other beEvery day it is likely rising to witness to some new breach of an Altarvow'd duty  Then my dear the man seems already to be meditating vengeance upon me for an aversion I cannot help For yesterday my saucy gaoleress assured me That all my oppositions would not signify that  pinch of snuff  holding out her genteel finger and thumb That I  must  have Mr Solmes That therefore I had not best carry my jest too far for that Mr Solmes was a man of spirit and had told HER that as I should surely be his I acted very unpoliticly since if he had not more  mercy  that was  her  word I know not if it were  his  than I had I might have cause to repent the usage I gave him to the last day of my life  But enough of this man who by what you repeat from Sir Harry Downeton has all the insolence of his Sex without any one quality to make that insolence tolerable  I have received two letters from Mr Lovelace since his visit to you which made three that I had not answer'd I doubted not his being very uneasy but in his last he complains in high terms of my silence not in the still small voice or rather style of  an humble Lover but in a style like that which would probably be used by a slighted Protector And his pride is again touched that like a  thief  or  evesdropper  he is forced to dodge about in hopes of a letter and return five miles and then to an inconvenient lodging without any  His letters and the copy of mine to him shall soon attend you Till when I will give you the substance of what I wrote to him yesterday  I take him severely to task for his freedom in threatening me thro' you with a visit to Mr Solmes or to my brother I say  'That surely I must be thought to be a creature fit to bear  anything  That violence and menaces from some of my  own family  are not enough for me to bear in order to make me avoid  him  but that I must have them from  him  too upon a supposition that I will oblige those whom it is both my  inclination  and  duty  to oblige in everything that is reasonable and in my power  'Very extraordinary I tell him that a violent spirit shall threaten to do a rash and unjustifiable thing which concerns  me  but little and himself a great deal if I do not something  as  rash my character and sex consider'd to divert him from it'  'I even hint that however it may affect me if any mischief shall be done on my account yet there are persons as far as I know who in my case would not think there would be reason for  much  regret were such a committed rashness as he threatens Mr Solmes with to rid her of  two  persons whom had she never known she had never been unhappy'  This is plaindealing my dear And I suppose he will put it into still plainer English for me  I take his pride to task on his disdaining to watch for my letters and for his  evesdropping  language And say  'That surely he has the less reason to think so hardly of his situation since his faulty morals  are the original cause of all and since faulty morals deservedly level all distinction and bring down rank and birth to the  Canaille  and to the necessity of which he complains of appearing if I must descend to his language as an  evesdropper  and a  thief  And then I sorbid him ever to expect another letter from me that is to subject him to such disgraceful hardships  'That as to the solemn vows and protestations he is so ready upon all occasions to make they have the less weight with me as they give a kind of demonstration that he himself thinks from his own character there is  reason  to make them  Deeds  are to me the only evidences of  intentions  And I am more and more convinced of the necessity of breakingoff a correspondence with a person whose addresses I see it is impossible either to expect my friends to encourage or him to deserve that they should  'What therefore I repeatedly desire is That since his birth alliances and expectations are such as will at anytime if his immoral character be not an objection procure him at least equal advantages in a woman whose taste and inclinations moreover might be better adapted to his own I insist upon it as well as advise it that he give up all thoughts of me And the rather as he has all along by his threatening and unpolite behaviour to my friends and whenever he speaks of them given me reason to conclude that there is more malice to  them  than regard to  me  in his perseverance'  This is the substance of the letter I have written to him  The man to be sure must have the penetration to observe that my correspondence with him hitherto is owing more to the severity I meet with than to a very high value for him And so I would have him think What a  worse  than Molochdeity is That  which expects an offering of reason duty and discretion to be made to its shrine  Your mamma is of opinion that  at last  my friends will relent Heaven grant that they mayBut my brother and sister have such an influence over everybody and are so determin'd so pique themselves upon subduing me and carrying their point that I despair that they willAnd yet if they do not I frankly own I would not scruple to throw myself upon any not disreputable protection by which I might avoid my present persecutions on one hand and not give Lovelace advantage over me on the otherThat is to say were there manifestly  no other  way left me For if there  were  I should think the leaving my father's house without his consent one of the most inexcusable actions I could be guilty of were the protection to be ever so unexceptionable and This notwithstanding the independent fortune willed me by my grandfather And indeed I have often reflected with a degree of indignation and disdain upon the thought of what a low selfish creature that child must be who is to be rein'din only by what a parent can or will do for her  But notwithstanding all this I owe it to the sincerity of friendship to confess that I know not what I  should  have done had your advice been conclusive any way Had you my dear been witness to my different emotions as I read your letter when in one place you advise me of my danger if I am carry'd to my uncle's in another when you own you could not bear what I bear and would do any thing rather than marry the man you hate yet in another represent to me my reputation suffering in the world's eye and the necessity I should be under to justify my conduct at the expence of my friends were I to take a rash step in another insinuate the  dishonest  figure I should be forced to make in so compell'd a matrimony endeavouring to cajole fawn  upon and play the hypocrite with a man I have an aversion to who would have reason to believe me an hypocrite as well from my former avowals as from the sense he  must  have if common sense he has of his own demeritsThe necessity you think there would be for me the more averse I really was to seem the fonder of him A fondness were I capable of so much dissimulation that would be imputable to the most disgraceful motives as it would be too visible that love either of person or mind could be neither of themThen his undoubted his even constitutional narrowness His too probable jealousy and unforgivingness bearing in mind my declared aversion and the unfeigned despights I took all opportunities to do him in order to discourage his address A preference avow'd against him from the  same  motive with the pride he professes to take in curbing and sinking the spirits of a woman he had acquired a right to tyrannize overHad you I say been witness of my different emotions as I read now leaning This way now That now perplexed now apprehensive now angry at one then at another now resolving now doubtingyou would have seen the power you have over me and would have had reason to believe that had you given your advice in any determin'd or positive manner I had been ready to have been concluded by it So my dear you will find from these acknowlegements that you must justify me to those Laws of Friendship which require undisguised frankness of heart altho' your justification of me in that particular will perhaps be at the expence of my prudence  But upon the whole This I do repeatThat nothing but the  last  extremity shall make me abandon my father's house if they will permit me to stay and if I can by any means by any honest pretences but keep off my evil destiny in it till my cousin Morden arrives As one of my trustees  his  is a protection  that I may without discredit throw myself into if my other friends should remain determin'd And This altho' they seem too well aware of it is all my hope For as to Lovelace were one to be sure of his tenderness to one'sself and even of his reformation must not the thoughts of embracing the offer'd protection of his family be the same in the world's eye as accepting of his ownCould I avoid receiving his visits at his own relations Must I not be his whatever on seeing him in a  nearer  light I should find him out to be For you know it has always been my observation that both sexes too generally cheat each other by the more  distant  Oh my dear how  wise  have I endeavour'd to be how anxious to choose and to avoid everything precautiously as I may say that might make me happy or unhappy yet all my wisdom now by a strange fatality likely to become foolishness  Then you tell me in your usual kindlypartial manner what is expected of  me  more than would be of some others This should be a lesson to me Whatever my motives the world would not know them To complain of a brother's unkindness  that  one might do It is too common a case where interests clash But where the unkind father cannot be separated from the faulty brother who could bear to lighten herself by loading a fatherThen in this particular case must not the hatred Mr Lovelace expresses to everyone of my family altho' in return  or  their  hatred of him shock one extremely Must it not shew that there is something implacable as well  s highly unpolite in his temperAnd what creature  an think of marrying so as to live at continual enmity with all her own relations  But here having tir'd myself and I dare say you will lay down my pen  Mr Solmes is almost continually here So is my  aunt Hervey So are my two uncles Something is working against me I doubt What an uneasy state is suspenseWhen a naked sword too seems hanging over one's head  I hear nothing but what this confident creature Betty throws out in the wantonness of office Now it is Why Miss don't you look up your things You'll be call'd upon depend upon it before you are awareAnother time she intimates darkly and in broken sentences as if on purpose to teaze me what  one  says what  another  with their inquiries how I dispose of my time And my brother's insolent question comes frequently in Whether I am not writing a history of my sufferings  But I am now used to her pertness And as it is only thro' that that I can hear of any thing intended against me before it is to be put in execution and as she pleads a commission when she is most impertinent I bear with her Yet nowandthen not without a little of the heartburn  I will deposite thus far Adieu my dear  CL HARLOWE  Written on the Cover after she went down with a pencil  On coming down I found your second letter of yesterday's date  See the next Letter  I have read it and am in hopes that the  within  will in a great measure answer your mamma's expectations of me  My most respectful acknowlegements to her for it and for her very kind admonitions  You'll read to her what you please of the inclosed  LETTER XIII Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Sat Mar  I Follow my last of this date by command I mentioned in my former my mamma's opinion of the merit you would have if you could oblige your friends against your own inclination Our conference upon this subject was introduced by the conversation we had had with Sir Harry Downeton and my mamma thinks it of so much importance that she injoins me to give you the particulars of it I the rather comply as I was unable in my last to tell what to advise you to and as you will in this recital have my mamma's opinion at least and perhaps in  hers  what the  world  's would be were it to know only what she knows and not so much as I know  My mamma argues upon this case in a most discouraging manner for all such of our sex as look forward for happiness in marriage with the  man of their choice    Only that I know she has a sideview to her daughter who at the same time that she now prefers no one to another values not the man her mamma most regards of one farthing or I should lay it more to heart  What is there in it says she that all this bustle is about Is it such a mighty matter for a young Lady to give up her own inclinations to oblige her friends  Very well my mamma thought I NOW may you ask thisAt FORTY you mayBut what would you have said at EIGHTEEN is the question  Either said she the Lady must be thought to have very violent inclinations and what nice young creature would have That supposed which she  could  not give up or a very stubborn will which she  would  not or thirdly have parents she was indifferent about obliging  You know my mamma now and then argues very notably always very warmly at least I happen often to differ from her and we both think so well of our own arguments that we very seldom are so happy as to convince one another A pretty common case I believe in all  vehement  debatings She says I am  too witty  Anglicè  too pert  I That she is  too wise  that is to say being likewise put into English  Not so young as she has been  In short is grown so much into  mother  that she has forgotten she ever was a  daughter  So generally we call another cause by consentYet fall into the old one half a dozen times over  without  consentQuitting and Resumeing with halfangry faces forced into a smile that there might be some room to piece together again But go to bed if bedtime a little sullen nevertheless or if we speak her silence is broke with an Ah Nancy You are so lively so quick I wish you were less like your papa child  I pay it off with thinking that my mamma has no reason to disclaim her share in her Nancy And if the matter go off with greater severity on her side than I wish for then her favourite Hickman fares the worse for it next day  I know I am a saucy creature I know if I do not  say  so you will  think  so so no more of This just now What I mention it for is to tell you that on this serious occasion I will omit if I can all that passed between us that had an air of flippancy on my part or quickness on my mamma's to let you into the  cool  and the  cogent  of the conversation  'Look thro' the families said she which we both know where the Gentleman and Lady have been said to marry for Love which at the time it is so called is perhaps no more than a passion begun in folly or thoughtlesness and carried on from a  spirit of perversness and opposition Here we had a parenthetical debate which I omit and see if they appear to be happier than those whose principal inducement to marry has been convenience or to oblige their friends or even whether they are generally  so  happy For  convenience  and  duty  where observed will afford a  permanent  and even an  increasing  satisfaction as well at the time as upon the reflection which seldom fail to reward themselves While  Love  if Love  be  the motive is an idle passion  Idle in  ONE SENSE  my mamma cannot say for Love is as busy as a monkey and as mischievous as a schoolboy  It is a  fervor  that like all other  fervors  lasts but a little while a bow overstrained that soon returns to its natural bent  'As it is founded generally upon mere  national  excellencies which were unknown to the persons themselves till attributed to either by the other one two or three months usually sets all right on both sides and then with open'd eyes they think of each otherjust as everybody else thought of them before  'The lovers  imaginaries  Her own word Notable enough i'n't it are by that time gone off Nature and Old habits painfully dispensed with or concealed return Disguises thrown aside all the moles freckles and defects in the minds of  each  discover themselves and 'tis well if each do not sink in the opinion of the other as much below the common standard as the blinded imagination of both had set them above it And now said she the fond pair who knew no felicity out of each other's company are so far from finding the neverending variety each had proposed in an unrestrained conversation with the other when they seldom were together and always parted with something  to say  or on recollection when parted wishing they  had  said that they are continually on the wing in pursuit  of amusements out of themselves and those concluded my sage mamma Did you think her wisdom so  very  moderne will perhaps be the livelier to each in which the other has no share'  I told my mamma that if  you  were to take any rash step it would be owing to the indiscreet violence of your friends I was afraid I said that these reflections upon the conduct of people in the married state who might set out with better hopes were but too wellgrounded But that this must be allowed me that if children weighed not these matters so thoroughly as they ought neither did parents make those allowances for youth inclination and inexperience which were necessary to be made for themselves at their childrens time of life  I remember'd a letter I told her hereupon which you wrote a few months ago personating an anonymous elderly Lady in Mr Wyerley's day of plaguing you to Miss Drayton's mamma who by her severity and restraints had like to have driven the young Lady into the very fault against which her mother was most sollicitous to guard her And I dared to say she would be pleased with it  I fetched the copy of it which you had favoured me with at the time I would have read only that par  of it which was most to my purpose But she would hear it all  The passage most particularly recommended by Miss Howe the following  'Permit me Madam says the personated grave writer to observe▪ That if persons of your experience would have young people look  for+ward  in order to be wiser and better by their advice it would be kin  in them to look  backward  and allow for their childrens youth an  natural vivacity in other words for their lively hopes unabated by time unaccompanied by reflection and unchecked by disappointment Things appear to us all in a very different light at our Entrance upon a favourite Party or Tour when with golden prospects and high ex+pectations we rise vigorous and fresh like the sun beginning it  morning course from what they do when we sit down at the End o  our views tired and preparing for our journey homeward For then we take into our  reflection  what we had left out of our  scheme  the fatigues the checks the hazards we had met with and make a true estimate of pleasures which from our raised expectations must necessarily have fallen miserably short of what we had promised ourselves at setting outNothing but experience can give us a strong and efficacious conviction of this difference And when we would inculcate the fruits of  that  upon the minds of those we love who have not lived long enough to find those fruits and would hope that our  advice  should have as much force upon  them  as  experience  has upon  us  and which perhaps  our  parents advice had not upon  ourselves  at our daughters time of life should we not proceed by patient reasoning and gentleness that we may not harden where we would convince For Madam the tenderest and most generous minds when harshly treated become generally the most inflexible If the young Lady knows her  heart  to be right however defective her  head  may be for want of years and experience she will be apt to be very tenacious And if she believes her friends to be wrong altho' perhaps they may be only so in their methods of treating her how much will every  unkind  circumstance on the parent's part or  heedless  one on the child's though ever so slight in itself widen the difference The parent's  prejudice  in  dis  favour will confirm the daughter's in favour of the same person and the best reasonings in the world on either side will be attributed to that prejudice In short neither of them will be convinced▪ A perpetual opposition ensues the parent grows impatient the child desperate And as a too natural consequence That falls out which the mother was most afraid of and which possibly had been prevented had the child's passions been only  led  not  driven  '    My mamma was pleased with the whole letter and said It deserved to have the effect it had But asked me what excuse could be offer'd for a young Lady capable of making such reflections and who at her time of life could so well assume the character of one of riper years if she should rush into any fatal mistake herself  She then touched upon the moral character of Mr Lovelace and how reasonable the aversion of your relations is to a man who gives himself the liberties he is said to take and who indeed himself denies not the accusation having been heard to declare that he will do all the mischief he can to the Sex in revenge for the ill usage and broken vows of his first love at a time when he was  too young  his own expression it seems to be insincere  I reply'd That I had heard every one say that that Lady really used him ill that it affected him so much at the time that he was forced to travel upon it and to drive her out of his heart ran into courses which he had ingenuity enough himself to condemn That however he had denied the menaces against the Sex which were attributed to him when charged with them by me in your presence and declared himself incapable of so unjust and ungenerous a resentment against  all  for the perfidy of  one    You remember this my dear as I do your innocent observation upon it That you could believe his solemn asseveration and denial  'For surely said you the man who would resent as the highest indignity that could be offer'd to a gentleman the imputation of a  wilful  falshood would not be guilty of one'  I insisted upon the extraordinary circumstances in your case particularizing them Observing that Mr Lovelace's morals were at one time no objection with your relations for Miss Arabella That then much was built upon his family and more upon his parts and learning which made it out of doubt that he might be reclaim'd by a woman of virtue and prudence And Pray forgive me for mentioning it I ventured to add that altho' your family might be good sort of folks as the world went yet nobody imputed to any of them but yourself a very punctilious concern for religion or pietyTherefore were they the less intitled to object to the defects of that kind in others Then what an odious man said I have they picked out to supplant in a Lady's affections one of the finest appearances of a man in England and one noted for his brilliant parts and other accomplishments whatever his morals might be as if they were determined upon an act of power and authority without rhyme or reason  Still my mamma insisted that there was the greater  merit in your obedience on that account and urged that there hardly ever was a very handsome and a sprightly man who made a good husband For that they were generally such Narcissus's as to imagine every woman ought to think as highly of them as they did of themselves  There was no danger from that consideration  here  I said because the Lady had still greater advantages both of person and mind than the Man graceful and elegant as he must be allowed to be beyond any of his sex  She cannot endure to hear me praise any man but her favourite Hickman Upon whom nevertheless she generally brings a degree of contempt which he would escape did she not lessen the little merit he has by giving him on all occasions more than I think he can deserve and entering him into comparisons in which it is impossible but he must be a sufferer And now preposterous partiality She thought for  her  part that Mr Hickman 'bating that his  face  indeed was not so smooth nor his complexion  quite  so good and saving that he was not so presuming and so bold which ought to be no fault with a modest woman equalled Mr Lovelace  at any hour of the day    To avoid entering further into such an  incomparable  comparison I said I did not believe had they left you to your own way and treated you generously that you would have had the thought of encouraging any man whom they disliked  Then Nancy catching me up the excuse is lessFor if so must there not be more of  contradiction  than  love  in the case  Not so neither Madam For I know Miss Clarissa Harlowe would prefer Mr Lovelace to all men if morals  If NancyThat  If  is everythingDo you really think she loves Mr Lovelace  What would you have had me to say my dearI won't tell you what I  did  sayBut had I  not  said what I  did  who would have believed me  Besides I  know  you love himExcuse me my dear Yet if you deny it what do you but reflect upon yourself as if you thought you  ought not  Indeed said I the man is worthy of any woman's love  If  again I could sayBut her parents Madam  Her parents NancyYou know my dear how my mamma who accuses her daughter of quickness is evermore interrupting  May take wrong measures said I  Cannot do wrongThey have reason I'll warrant said she  By which they may provoke a young Lady said I to do rash things which otherwise see would not do  But if it  be  a rash thing returned she should she do it A prudent daughter will not wilfully err because her parents err if they  were  to err If she  do  the world which blames the parents will not acquit the child All that can be said in extenuation of a daughter's error arises from a kind consideration which Miss's letter to Lady Drayton pleads for to be paid to  her  daughter's youth and inexperience And will such an admirable young person as Miss Clarissa Harlowe whose prudence as we see qualifies her to be an adviser of persons much older than herself take shelter under so poor a covert  Let her know Nancy out of hand what I say and I charge you to represent farther to her That let her dislike one man and approve another ever somuch it will be expected of a young Lady of her unbounded generosity and greatness of mind that she should  deny herself  when she can  oblige all her family  by so doing No less than ten or a dozen perhaps the nearest and dearest to her of all the persons in the  world an indulgent father and mother at the head of them It may be  fancy  only on her side but parents look deeper And will not Miss Clarissa Harlowe give up her  fancy  to her parents  judgment  I said a great deal upon this  judgment  subject All that you could wish I should say and all that your extraordinary case allowed me to say And my mamma was so sensible of the force of it that she charged me not to write to you any part of my answer to what she said but only what she herself had advanced lest in so critical a case it should induce you to take measures that might give us both reason I for giving it you for following it to repent it as long as we lived  And thus my dear I set my mamma's arguments before you And the rather as I cannot myself tell what to advise you to doYou know best your own heart and what That will let you do  Robin undertakes to deposite This very early that you may receive it by your first morning airing  Heaven guide and direct you for the best is the incessant prayer of  Your everaffectionate ANNA HOWE  LETTER XIV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sunday Afternoon  I Am in great apprehensions Yet cannot help repeating my humble thanks to your mamma and you for your last favour I hope her kind end is answer'd by the contents of my last Yet I must not think it enough to acknowlege her goodness to me with a pencil only on the cover of a letter sealed up A few lines give me leave to write with  regard to my anonymous letter to Lady DraytonIf I did not at that time tell you as I believe I did that my excellent Mrs Norton gave me her assistance in that letter I now acknowlege that she did  Pray let your mamma know this for two reasons One that I may not be thought to arrogate to myself a discretion which does not belong to me the other that I may not suffer by the severe but just inference she was pleased to draw  doubling  my faults upon me if I myself should act unworthy of the advice I was supposed to give  Before I come to what most nearly affects me I must chide you once more for the severe the very severe things you mention of our family to the disparagement of their morals as I may say Indeed my dear I wonder at youA slighter occasion might have passed me after I have written to you so often to so little purpose on this topic But affecting as my own circumstances are I cannot without a breach of duty let slip the reflection I need not repeat in words  There is not a worthier person in England than my mamma Nor is my papa that man you sometimes make him Excepting in one point I know not any family which lives up more to their duty than the principals of ours A little too  uncommunicative  for their great circumstancesthat is allWhy then have they not reason to insist upon unexceptionable morals in a man whose relationship to them by a marriage in their family they have certainly a right to allow of or disapprove  Another line or two before I am ingross'd by my own concernsUpon your treatment of Mr HickmanIs it do you think generous to revenge upon an innocent person the displeasure you receive from another quarter where I doubt you are a trespasser tooBut one thing I can tell him and you had not best provoke me to it That no woman uses  a man ill whom she does not absolutely reject but she has it in her heart to make him amends when her tyranny has had its run and he has completed the measure of his services and patience But my mind is not enough at ease to push this matter further  I will now give you the occasion of my present apprehensions  I had reason to fear as I mention'd in mine of this morning that a storm was brewing Mr Solmes came home this afternoon from church with my brother Soon after Betty brought me up a letter without saying from whom It was in a cover and directed by a hand I never saw before as if it was supposed I would not have received and open'd it had I known it came from him These are the contents  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Sunday Mar  Dearest Madam  I Think myself a most unhappy man in that I have never yet been able to pay my respects to you with youre consent for one halfe hour I have something to communicate to you that concernes you much if you be pleased to admitt me to youre speech Youre honour is concerned in itt and the honour of all youre familly Itt relates to the designes of one whom you are sed to valew more then he deserves and to some of his reprobat actions which I am reddie to give you convincing proofes of the truth of I may appear to be interessed in itt But neverthelesse I am reddy to make oathe that every tittle is true And you will see what a man you are sed to favour But I hope not so for youre owne honour  Pray Madam vouchsafe me a hearing as you valew your honour and familly Which will oblidge dearest Miss  Youre most humble and most faithfull Servant ROGER SOLMES  I waite below for the hope of admittance  I have no manner of doubt that this is a poor device to get this man into my company I would have sent down a verbal answer but Betty refused to carry any message which should prohibit his visiting me So I was obliged either to see him or to write to him I wrote therefore an answer of which I shall send you the rough draught And now my heart akes for what may follow from it for I hear a great hurry below  To  ROGER SOLMES    Esq  SIR  WHatever you have to communicate to me which concerns my honour may as well be done by writing as by word of mouth If Mr Lovelace is any of  my  concern I know not that  therefore  he ought to be  yours▪  For the usage I receive on  your  account I  must  think it so is so harsh that were there not such a man in the world as Mr  Lovelace  I would not wish to see Mr  Solmes  no not for one halfhour in the way he is pleased to be desirous to see me I never can be in any danger from Mr Lovelace and of consequence cannot be affected by any of your discoveries if the proposal I made be accepted You have been acquainted with it no doubt If not be pleased to let my friends know that if they will rid  me  of my apprehensions of one gentleman I will rid them of  theirs  of another And then of what consequence to  them  or to  me  will it be whether Mr Lovelace be a good man or a bad▪ And if to neither of  us  I see not how it can be of any to  you  But if  you  do I have nothing to say to That and it will be a Christian part if you will expostulate with him upon the errors you have discover'd and endeavour to make him as good a man as no doubt you are  yourself  or you would not be so ready to detect and expose  him    Excuse me SirBut after my former letter to  you and your ungenerous perseverance and after this attempt to avail yourself at the expence of another man's character rather than by your own proper merit I see not that you can blame any asperity in Her whom you have so largely contributed to make unhappy  CL HARLOWE  Sunday night  MY father was for coming up to me in great wrath it seems but was persuaded to the contrary My aunt Hervey was permitted to send me This that followsQuick work my dear  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Niece  EVerybody is now convinc'd that nothing is to be done with you by way of gentleness or persuasion Your mamma will not let you stay in the house for your papa is so incensed by your strange letter to his friend that she knows not what will be the consequence if you do So you are commanded to get ready to go to your uncle Antony's out of hand  Your uncle thinks he has not deserv'd of you this unwillingness to go to his house  You don't know the wickedness of the man you think it worth while to quarrel with all your friends for  You must not answer me There will be no end of That  You know not the affliction you give to everybody but to none more than to  Your affectionate Aunt DOROTHY HERVEY  Forbid to write to my aunt I took a bolder liberty I wrote a few lines to my mamma imploring  her to procure me leave to throw myself at my father's feet and hers if I  must  go nobody else present to beg pardon for the trouble I had given them both and their blessings and to receive their commands as to my removal and the  when  from their own lips  'What new boldness ThisTake it back and bid her learn to obey'  was my mamma's angry answer with my letter return'd unopen'd  But that I might omit nothing that was in my power or heart to do that had an appearance of duty I wrote a few lines to my papa himself to the same purpose begging he would not turn me out of his house without his blessing But This torn in two pieces and unopen'd was brought me up again by Betty with an air one hand held up the other extended the torn letter in her open palm and a See hereWhat a  sad  thing is ThisNothing will do but duty MissYour papa said Let her tell me of  deeds  I'll receive no  words  from her And so he tore the letter and flung the pieces at my head  So desperate my case I was resolved not to stop even at this repulse I took my pen and addressed myself to my uncle Harlowe inclosing that which my mamma had return'd unopen'd and the torn unopen'd one sent to my papa having first scratch'd thro' a transcript for you  My uncle was going home and it was deliver'd to him just as he stepped into his chariot What may be the fate of it therefore I cannot know till tomorrow  The following is a copy of it  To  JOHN HARLOWE    Esq    My dear and everhonoured Uncle  I Have nobody now but you to whom I can apply with hope so much as to have my humble addresses  open'd and read My aunt Hervey has given me commands which I want to have explain'd but she has forbid me writing to her Hereupon I took the liberty to write to my papa and mamma You will see Sir by the torn one and by both being return'd  un  open'd what has been the result This Sir perhaps you know But as you know not the  contents  of the disgraced letters I beseech you to read them both that you may be a witness for me that they are not filled with complaints with expostulations nor contain any thing undutiful Give me leave to say Sir That if deafear'd anger will neither grant  me  a hearing nor  what I write  a perusal some time hence the hardheartedness may be regretted I beseech you dear good Sir to let me know what is meant by sending me to my uncle Antony's rather than to your house or to my aunt's or elsewhere If it be for what I apprehend it to be life will not be supportable upon the terms I beg also to know WHEN I am to be turned out of doorsMy heart strongly gives me that once I am compelled to leave this house I never shall see it more  It becomes me however to declare that I write not This thro' perverseness or in resentment God knows my heart I do notBut the treatment I apprehend I shall meet with if carried to my other uncle's will in all probability give the finishing stroke to the distresses the  undeserved  distresses I will be bold to call them of  Your once highly favour'd But now most unhappy Kinswoman CL HARLOWE  LETTER XV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Monday morning March  THIS morning early my uncle Harlowe came hither He sent me up the inclosed very tender letter It has made me wish I  could  oblige himYou'll see how Mr Solmes's ill qualities are gloss'd over in it What blemishes does affection hideSo perhaps may they say to me What faults does antipathy bring to light Be pleased to send me back this letter of my uncle's by the first return I may possibly try to account for and wish to obviate my being such a formidable creature to my whole family as I am represented in it  Sunday night or rather Monday morning  I Must answer you tho' against my own intention Everybody loves you and you know they do The very ground you walk upon is dear to most of us But how can we resolve to see you There is no standing against your looks and language It is the strength of our love makes us decline to see you How  can  we when you are resolved not to  do  what we are resolved you  shall  do I never for my part loved any creature as I loved you from your youth till now And indeed as I have often said Never was there a young creature so deserving of our love But what is come to you nowAlas alas my dear How you fail in the trial  I have read the letters you inclosed At a proper time I may shew them to my brother and sister But they will receive nothing from you at present  For my part I could not read your letter to myself without being unmann'd How can you be so unmov'd yourself yet be so able to move everybody else How could you send such a letter to Mr Solmes Fie upon youHow strangely are you alter'd  Then to treat your brother and sister as you did that they don't care to write to you or to see youDon't you know where it is written That  soft answers turn away wrath  But if you will trust to your sharppointed wit you may wound But a club will beat down a sword And how can you expect that they who are hurt by you will not hurt you againWas this the way you used to take to make us all adore you as we didNo it was your gentleness of heart and manners that made everybody even strangers at first sight treat you as a Lady and call you a Lady tho' not born one as your mamma was any more than your sister while she was only plain Miss Harlowe or Miss Arabella If you  were  envied why should you sharpen envy and file up its teeth to an edgeYou see I write like an impartial man and as one that loves you still  But since you have display'd your talents and spared nobody and moved everybody without being moved you have but made us stand the closer and firmer together This is what I likened to an imbattled Phalanx once before Your aunt Hervey forbids your writing for the same reason that I must not countenance it We are all afraid to see you because we know we shall be made as so many fools Nay your mamma is so afraid of you that once or twice when she thought you was coming to force yourself into her presence she shut the door and locked herself in because she knew she must not see you upon  your  terms and you are resolved you will not see her upon  hers    Resolve but to oblige us all my dearest Miss Clary and you shall see how we will clasp you every one by turns to our rejoicing heartsIf the one man has not the wit and the parts and the person of the other no one breathing has a worse heart than that other And is not the love of all your friends and a sober man if he be not so polished to be preferred  to a debauchee tho' ever so sine a man to look at You have such fine talents that you will be adored by the one But the other has as much advantage in those respects as you have yourself and will not set by them one straw For husbands are sometimes jealous of their authority with witty wives You will have in one a man of virtue Had you not been so rudely affronting to him he would have made your ears tingle with what he could have told you of the other  Come my dear niece let me have the honour of doing with you what nobody else yet has been able to do Your father mother and I will divide the pleasure and the  honour  I will again call it between us and all past offences shall be forgiven and Mr Solmes we will engage shall take nothing amiss hereafter that is just  He knows he says what a jewel that man will have who can obtain your favour and he will think light of all he has suffer'd or shall suffer in obtaining you  Dear sweet creature oblige us And oblige us with a grace It  must  be done whether with a grace or not I do assure you it  must  You must not conquer father mother uncles everybody Depend upon That  I have sat up half the night to write This You don't know how I am touch'd at reading yours and writing this Yet will I be at Harloweplace early in the morning So upon reading this if you will oblige us all send me word to come up to your apartment And I will lead you down and present you to the embraces of everyone And you will then see you have more of a brother and sister than of late your prejudices will let you think you have This from one who used to love to stile himself  Your paternal Uncle JOHN HARLOWE  In about an hour after this kind letter was given me my uncle sent up to know if he should be a welcome visitor upon the terms mention'd in his letter He bid Betty bring him down a verbal answer A written one he said would be a bad sign and he bid her therefore not bring a letter But I had just finish'd the inclosed transcription of one I had been writing She made a difficulty to carry it but was prevailed upon to oblige me by a token which these Mrs Betty's cannot withstand  Dear and honoured Sir  HOW you rejoice me by your condescending goodnessSo kind so paternal a letterso soothing to a wounded heart and of late what I have been so little used toHow am I affected with it Tell me not dear Sir of my way of writing Your letter has more moved  me  than I ever could move  anybody  It has made me with all my heart wish I could intitle myself to be visited upon your own terms and to be led down to my papa and mamma by so good and so kind an uncle  I will tell you dearest Sir what I will do to make my peace I have no doubt that Mr Solmes would greatly prefer my sister to such a strange averse creature as me His chief or one of his chief motives to address me is as I have reason to believe the contiguity of my grandfather's estate to his own I will resign it for ever I will resign it And the resignation must be good because I will never marry at all I will make it over to my sister and her heirs for ever I shall have no heirs but my brother and her and I will receive as of my papa's bounty such an annuity not in lieu of the estate but as  of  his bounty as he shall be pleased to grant me if it be ever so small and whenever I disoblige him he shall withdraw it at his pleasure  Will not This be acceptedSure it mustSure  it willI beg of you dearest Sir to propose it and second it with your interest This will answer every end My sister has a high opinion of Mr Solmes I never can have  any  in the light he is proposed to me But as my sister's husband he will be always intitled to my respect and shall have it  If this be accepted grant me Sir the honour of a visit and do me then the inexpressible pleasure of leading me down to the feet of my honoured parents and they shall find me the most dutiful of children and to the arms of my brother and sister and they shall find me the most obliging and most affectionate of sisters  I wait Sir for your answer to this proposal made with the whole heart of  Your dutiful and most obliged Niece CL HARLOWE  Monday noon  I HOPE this will be accepted For Betty tells me that my uncle Antony and my aunt Hervey are sent for and not Mr Solmes which I look upon as a favourable circumstance With what chearfulness will I assign over this envied estateWhat a much more valuable consideration shall I part with it forThe love and favour of all my relationsThat love and favour which I used for eighteen years together to rejoice in and be distinguished byAnd what a charming pretence will this afford me of breaking with Mr Lovelace And how easy will it possibly make him to part with  me  I found this morning in the usual place a letter from him in answer I suppose to mine of Friday which I deposited not till Saturday But I have not opened it nor will I till I see what effect this new offer will have  Let me but be permitted to avoid the man I hate and I will give up with all my heart the man I  could prefer To renounce the one were I really to value him as you seem to imagine can give but a temporary concern which time and discretion will make light This is a sacrifice which a child owes to parents and friends if they insist upon its being made But the other to marry a man one  cannot endure  is not only a dishonest thing as to the man but it is enough to make a creature who wishes to be a good wife a bad or indifferent one as I once wrote to the man himself And then she can hardly be either a good mistress a good friend or any thing but a discredit to her family and a bad example to all around her  Methinks I am loth in the  suspense  I am in at present to deposite this because I shall then leave you in as  great  But having been prevented by Betty's officiousness twice I will now go down to my little poultry and if I have an opportunity will leave it in the usual place where I hope to find something from you  LETTER XVI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Monday afternoon March  I HAVE deposited my narrative down to this day noon but I hope soon to follow it with another letter that I may keep you as little a while as possible in that suspense which I am so much affected by at this moment For my heart is disturbed at every foot I hear stir and every door below that I hear open or shut  They have been all assembled some time and are in close debate I believe But can there be room for long debate upon a proposal which if accepted will so effectually answer all their viewsCan they insist a moment longer upon my having Mr Solmes  when they see what sacrifices I am ready to make to be freed from his addressesO but I suppose the struggle is first with Bella's nicety to persuade her to accept of the estate and of the husband and next with her pride to take her  sister's refusals  as she once phrased itOr it may be my brother is insisting upon equivalents for his reversion in the estate And these sort of things take up but too much the attention of some of our family To these no doubt one or both it must be owing that my proposal admits of so much consideration I want methinks to see what Lovelace in his letter says But I will deny myself  this  piece of curiosity till that which is raised by my present suspense is answeredExcuse me my dear that I thus trouble you with my uncertainties But I have no employment nor heart if I had to pursue any other but what my pen affords me  Monday evening  WOULD you believe itBetty by anticipation tells me that I am to be refused I am  'a vile artful creature Everybody is too good to me My uncle Harlowe has been  takenin  that's the phrase They knew how it would be if he either wrote to me or saw me He has however been made ashamed to be so wrought uponA pretty thing truly in the eye of the world were they to take me at my word It would look as if they had treated me thus hardly as  I  think it for this very purpose My peculiars particularly Miss Howe would give it that turn and I myself could mean nothing by it but to see if it would be accepted in order to strengthen my own arguments against Mr Solmes It was amazing that it could admit of a moment's deliberation That any thing could be  supposed  to be done in it It was equally against Law and Equity And a fine security Miss Bella  would have or Mr Solmes when I could resume it when I wouldMy  brother  and  she  my heirs O the artful creature  I  to resolve to live single when Lovelace was so  sure  of meand everywhere declared as muchand could whenever he pleased if my husband claim under the WillThen the insolencethe confidenceas Betty mincingly told me that one said you may easily guess who that she who was so justly in disgrace for downright rebellion should pretend to prescribe to the whole familyshould name a husband for her elder sisterWhat a triumph would her obstinacy go away with to delegate her commands not as from a prison as she called it but as from her throne to her elders and betters and to her father and mother tooAmazing perfectly amazing that anybody could argue upon such a plan as this It was a masterstroke of finesseIt was ME in perfectionSurely my uncle Harlowe will never be so takenin again'  All this was the readier told me because it was against me and would teaze and vex me But as some of this fine recapitulation implied that somebody spoke up for me I was curious to know who it was But Betty would not tell me for fear I should have the consolation to find that  all  were not against me  But do you not see my dear what a sad creature she is whom you honour with your friendshipYou could not doubt your influence over me Why did you not let me know myself a little betterWhy did you not take the friendly liberty I have always taken with you and tell me my faults and what a specious hypocrite I am For if my brother and sister could make such discoveries how is it possible that faults so enormous You could see  others  you thought of a  more secret  nature could escape your penetrating eye  Well but now it seems they are debating how and by whom to answer me For they know not nor  are  they to know that Mrs Betty has told me all these fine things One desires to be excused it seems Another chooses not to have any thing to say to me Another has enough of me And of writing to so ready a scribbler there will be no end  Thus are those imputed qualifications which used so lately to gain me applause now become my crimes so much do disgust and anger alter the property of things  What will be the result of their debate I suppose will somehow or other be communicated to me byandby But let me tell you my dear that I am made so desperate that I am afraid to open Mr Lovelace's letter lest in the humour I am in I should do something if I find it not exceptionable that may give me repentance as long as I live  Monday night  THIS moment the following letter is brought me by Betty  Monday o' clock  Miss Cunningones  YOUR fine new proposal is thought unworthy of a particular answer Your uncle Harlowe is ashamed to be so takenin Have you no new fetch for your uncle Antony Go round with us child now your hand's in But I was bid to write only one line that you might not complain as you did of your worthy sister for the freedoms you provoked It is ThisPrepare yourself Tomorrow you go to my uncle Antony's That's all child  JAMES HARLOWE  I was vexed to the heart at this And immediately in the warmth of resentment wrote the inclosed to my uncle Harlowe who it seems stays here this night  To  JOHN HARLOWE  Esq    Monday night  Honoured Sir  I Find I am a very sad creature and did not know it I wrote not to my Brother To  you  Sir I wrote From  you  I hope the honour of an answer No one reveres her uncles more than I do Nevertheless I will be bold to say that the distance great as it is between uncle and niece excludes not such a hope And I think I have not made a proposal that deserves to be treated with scorn  Forgive me SirMy heart is fullPerhaps one day you may think you have been  prevailed upon  for that is plainly the case to join to treat me as I do not deserve to be treated If  you  are ashamed as my brother hints of having expressed any returning tenderness to me God help me I see I have no mercy to expect from anybody But Sir from  your  pen let me have an answer I humbly beseech it of youTill my brother can recollect what belongs to a sister I will take no answer from  him  to the letter I wrote to  you  nor any commands whatever  I  move everybody This Sir is what you are pleased to mentionBut whom have I movedOne person in the family has more moving ways than I have or he could never so undeservedly have made everybody ashamed to shew any tenderness to a poor distressed child of the same family  Return me not this with contempt or torn or unanswer'd I beseech you My papa has a title to do that or anything by his child But from no other person in the world of your sex ought a young creature of mine while she preserves a supplicating spirit to be so treated  When what I have before written in the humblest strain has met with such strange constructions I am afraid that this unguarded scrawl will be very illreceived But I beg Sir you will oblige me with  one line be it ever so harsh in answer to my proposal I still think it ought to be attended to I will enter into the most solemn engagements to make it valid by a perpetual single life In a word any thing I  can  do I  will  do to be restored to all your favours More I cannot say but that I am very undeservedly  A most unhappy creature  Betty scrupled again to carry this letter and said she should have anger and I should but have it returned in scraps and bits  I must take That chance I said I only desired she would deliver it as directed  Sad doings very sad she said that young Ladies should so violently set themselves against their duty  I told her she should have the liberty to say what she pleased so she would but be my messenger that one timeAnd down she went with it  I bid her if she could slide it into my uncle's hand unseen at least unseen by my brother or sister for fear it should meet thro'  their  good offices with the fate she had bespoken for it  She would not undertake for That she said  I am now in expectation of the result But having so little ground to hope for either favour or mercy I opened Mr Lovelace's letter  I would send it to you my dear as well as those I shall inclose by this conveyance but not being able at present to determine in what manner I shall answer it I will give myself the trouble of abstracting it here while I am waiting for what may offer from the letter just gone down  'He laments as usual my ill opinion of him and readiness to believe every thing to his disadvantage He puts into plain English as I supposed he would my hint that I might be happier if by any rashness he might be guilty of to Solmes he should come to an untimely end himself'  He is concerned he says  'That the violence he had expressed on his extreme apprehensiveness of losing me should have made him guilty of any thing I had so much reason to resent'  He owns  'That he is passionate All goodnatured men he says are so and a sincere man cannot hide it'  But appeals to me  'Whether if any occasion in the world could excuse the rashness of his expressions it would not be his present dreadful situation thro' my indifference and the malice of his enemies'  He says  'He has more reason than ever from the contents of my last to apprehend that I shall be prevailed upon by force if not by fair means to fall in with my brother's measures and sees but too plainly that I am preparing him to expect it  'Upon this presumption he supplicates with the utmost earnestness that I will not give way to the malice of his enemies  'Solemn vows of reformation and everlasting truth and obligingness he makes all in the style of desponding humility yet calls it a cruel turn upon him to impute his protestations to a consciousness of the necessity there is for making them from his bad character  'He despises himself he solemnly protests for his past follies Thanks God he has seen his error and nothing but my more particular instructions are wanting to perfect his reformation  'He promises that he will do every thing that I shall think he can do with honour to bring about a reconciliation with my father and will even if I insist upon it make the first overture to my brother and treat him as his own brother because he is mine if he will not by new affronts revive the remembrance of the past  'He begs in the most earnest and humble manner for one halfhour's interview undertaking by  a key which he owns he has to the gardendoor leading into the  Coppice  as we call it if I will but unbolt the door to come into the garden at night and wait till I have an opportunity to come to him that he may reassure me of the truth of all he writes and of the affection and if needful protection of all his family  'He presumes not he says to write by way of menace to me but if I refuse him this favour he knows not so desperate have some strokes in my letter made him what his despair may make him do'  He asks me  'Determined as my friends are and far as they have already gone and declare they will go what I can propose to do to avoid having Mr Solmes if I am carried to my uncle Antony's unless I resolve to accept of the protection he has offered to procure me or except I will escape to London or elsewhere while I  can  escape'  He advises me  'To sue to  your  mamma for her private reception of me only till I can obtain possession of my own estate and procure my friends to be reconciled to me which he is sure they will be desirous to  be  the moment I am out of their power'  He apprises me It is still my wonder how he comes by his intelligence  'That my friends have written to my cousin Morden to represent matters to him in their own partial way nor doubt they to influence him on their side of the question  'That all this shews I have but  one way  if none o  my own friends or intimates will receive me  'If I will transport him with the honour of my choice of this  one way  settlements shall be drawn with proper blanks which I shall fill up as I please▪ Let him but have my commands from my own mouth all my doubts and scruples from my own lips and only a repetition that I will not on any  consideration be Solmes's wife and he shall be easyBut after such a letter as I have written nothing but an interview can make him so'  He beseeches me therefore  'To unbolt the door  as that very night  If I receive not this time enough  this night  and he will in a disguise that shall not give a suspicion who he is if he should be seen come to the gardendoor in hopes to open it with his key nor will he have any other lodging than in the Coppice both nights watching every wakeful hour for the propitious unbolting unless he has a letter with my orders to the contrary or to make some other appointment'  This letter was dated yesterday So he was there last night I suppose and will be there this night and I have not written a line to him And now it is too late were I determined  what  to write  I hope he will not go to Mr SolmesI hope he will not come hitherIf he does I will break with him for ever  What have I to do with such headstrong spirits I wish I had neverBut what signifies wishingI am strangely perplexedBut I need not have told you this after such a representation of my situation  LETTER XVII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Tuesday Morning  o'Clock    MY uncle has vouchsafed to answer me This is his letter but just now brought me altho' written last night late I suppose  Monday Night  Miss Clary  SINCE you are grown such a bold challenger and teach us all our duty tho' you will not practise your own I  must  answer youNobody wants your estate from you Are  you  who refuse everybody's advice to prescribe a husband to your  sister  Your letter to Mr Solmes is inexcusable I blam'd you for it before Your parents  will  be obey'd It is fit they  should  Your mamma has nevertheless prevailed to have your going to your uncle Antony's put of till Thursday Yet owns you deserve not that or any other favour from her I will receive no more of your letters You are too artful for me You are an ingrateful and unreasonable child You will have your will paramount to everybody's How are you alter'd  Your displeased Uncle JOHN HARLOWE  To be carry'd away on ThursdayTo the moated HouseTo the ChapelTo Solmes How can I think of thisThey will make me desperate  Tuesday Morn Eight o'Clock  I HAVE another letter from Mr Lovelace I open'd it with the expectation of its being filled with bold and free complaints on my not writing to prevent his two nights watching in weather not extremely agreeable But instead of complaints he is  'full of tender concern lest I may have been prevented by indisposition or by the closer confinement which he has frequently caution'd me that I may expect'  He says  'He had been in different disguises loitering about our garden and park wall all the day on Sunday last and all Sundaynight was wandering about the coppice and near the backdoor It rain'd  and he has got a great cold attended with feverishness and so hoarse that he has almost lost his voice'  Why did he not flame out in his letterTreated as I am treated by my friends it is dangerous for me to lie under the sense of an obligation to any one's patience when that person suffers in health for my sake  'He had no shelter he says but under the great overgrown Ivy which spreads wildly round the heads of two or three Oaklings and that was soon wet through'  You and I my dear once thought ourselves obliged to the natural shade they afforded us in a sultry day  I can't help saying I am sorry he has suffer'd for my sakeBut 'tis his own seeking  His letter is dated last night at eight  'And indisposed as he is he tells me That he will watch till ten in hopes of my giving him the meeting he so earnestly requests And after that he has a mile to walk to his horse and servant and four miles then to ride to his inn'  He owns  'That he has an intelligencer in our family who has failed him for a day or two past And not knowing how I do or how I may be treated his anxiety is the greater'  This circumstance gives me to guess who this treacherous man is One Joseph Leman The very creature imploy'd and confided in more than any other by my brother  This is not an honourable way of proceeding in Mr LovelaceDid he learn this infamous practice of corrupting the servants of other families at the French Court where he resided a good while  I have been often jealous of this Leman in my little airings and poultryvisits I have thought him doubly obsequious as he was always to me my brother's spy  upon me and altho' he oblig'd me by his hastening out of the garden and poultryyard whenever I came into either have wonder'd that from his reports my liberties of those kinds have not been abridged So possibly this man may take a bribe of both and yet betray both Worthy views want not such obliquities as these on either side An honest mind must rise into indignation both at the traitormaker and the traitor  'He presses with the utmost earnestness for an interview He would not offer he says to disobey my last personal commands that he should not endeavour to attend me again in the woodhouse But says he can give me such reasons for my permitting him to wait upon my father or uncles as he hopes will be approved by me For be cannot help observing that it is no more suitable to my own spirit than to his that he a man of fortune and family should be obliged to pursue such a clandestine address as would only become a vile fortunehunter But if I will give my consent for his visiting me like a man and a gentleman no treatment shall provoke him to forfeit his temper  'His uncle will accompany him if I please Or his aunt Lawrance will first make the visit to my mamma or to my aunt Hervey or even to my uncles if I choose it And such terms shall be offer'd as  shall  have weight upon them  'He begs that I will not deny him making a visit to Mr Solmes By all that's good he vows that it shall not be with the least intention either to hurt or affront him but only to set before him calmly and rationally the consequences that may possibly flow from so fruitless a perseverance as well as the ungenerous folly of it to a mind so noble as mine He repeats his own resolution to attend my pleasure and Mr Morden's arrival and advice for the reward of his own patience  'It is impossible he says but one of these methods  must  do Presence he observes even of a disliked person takes off the edge from resentments which absence whets and makes keen  'He therefore most earnestly repeats his importunities for the supplicated interview'  Says  'He has business of consequence in London But cannot stir from the inconvenient spot where he has for some time resided in disguises unworthy of himself until he can be absolutely certain that I shall not be prevailed upon either by force or otherwise and until he finds me deliver'd from the insults of my brother Nor ought This to be an indifferent point to one for whose sake all the world reports me to be used so unworthily as I am usedBut  one  remark he says he cannot help making That did my friends know the little favour I shew him and the very great distance I keep him at they would have no reason to confine me on his account And  another  that they themselves seem to think him intitled to a different usage and expect that he receives it when in truth what he meets with from me is exactly what they wish him to meet with excepting in the favour of the correspondence I honour him with upon which he says he puts the highest value and for the sake of which he has chearfully submitted to a thousand indignities  'He renews his professions of reformation He is convinc'd he says that he has already run a long and dangerous course and that it is high time to think of returning It must be from proper convictions he says that a person who has lived too gay a life resolves to reclaim before age or sufferings come upon him  'All generous spirits he observes hate compulsion Upon this observation he dwells but regrets that he is likely to owe all his hopes to this compulsion this  injudicious  compulsion he justly calls it and  none to my esteem for him Altho' he presumes upon some merit In his implicit regard to my will In the bearing the daily indignities offer'd not only to him but to his relations by my brother In the nightly watchings and risques which he runs in all weathers and which his present indisposition makes him mention or he had not debased the nobleness of his passion for me by such a selfish instance'  I cannot but say I am sorry the man is not well  I am afraid to ask you my dear what  you  would have done thus situated But what I  have  done I  have  done In a word I wrote  'That I would if possible give him a meeting tomorrow night between the hours of nine and twelve by the ivysummerhouse or in it or near the great cascade at the bottom of the garden and would unbolt the door that he might come in by his own key But that if I found the meeting impracticable or should change my mind I would signify as much by another line which he must wait for until it were dark'  Tuesday Eleven o' Clock  I AM just return'd from depositing my billet How diligent is this man It is plain he was in waiting For I had walked but a few paces after I had deposited it when my heart misgiving me I return'd to have taken it back in order to reconsider it as I walked and whether I should or should not let it go But I found it gone  In all probability there was but a brick wall of a few inches thick between Mr Lovelace and me at the very time I put the letter under the brick  I am come back dissatisfy'd with myself But I think my dear there can be no harm in meeting him If I do  not  he may take some violent measures What he knows of the treatment I meet with in malice to him and with a view to frustrate all his hopes may make him desperate His behaviour last time I  saw him under the disadvantages of time and place and surprised as I was gives me no apprehension of any thing but discovery What he requires is not unreasonable and cannot affect my future choice and determination It is only to assure him from my own lips that I will never be the wife of a man I hate If I have not an opportunity to meet without hazard or detection he must once more bear the disappointment All his trouble and mine too is owing to his faulty character This altho' I hate tyranny and arrogance in all shapes makes me think less of the risques he runs and the fatigues he undergoes than otherwise I should do and still less as my sufferings derived from the same source are greater than his  Betty confirms the intimation that I must go to my uncle's on Thursday She was sent on purpose to direct me to prepare myself for going and to help me to get up every thing in order to it  LETTER XVIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Tuesday Three o' Clock March  I HAVE mention'd several times the pertness of Mrs Betty to me and now having a little time upon my hands I will give you a short dialogue that passed just now between us It may perhaps be a little relief to you from the dull subjects with which I am perpetually teazing you  As she attended me at dinner she took notice That Nature is satisfy'd with a very little nourishment And thus she complimentally proved itFor Miss said she you eat nothing yet never looked more charmingly in your life  As to the former part of your speech Betty said I you observe well and I have often thought when  I have seen how healthy the children of the labouring poor  look  and  are  with empty stomachs and hardly a good meal in a week that Providence is very kind to its creatures in this respect as well as in all others in making  Much  not necessary to the support of life when three parts in four of its creatures if it were would not know how to obtain it It puts me in mind of two proverbial sentences which are full of admirable meaning  What pray Miss are they I love to hear you talk when you are so sedate as you seem now to be  The one is to the purpose we are speaking of  Poverty is the mother of health  And let me tell you Betty if I had a better appetite and were to encourage it with so little rest and so much distress and persecution I don't think I should be able to preserve my reason  There's no inconvenience but has its convenience  said Betty giving me proverb for proverb But what is the other Madam  That the  pleasures of the mighty are obtain'd by the tears of the poor  It is but reasonable therefore methinks that the plenty of the one should be followed by distempers and that the indigence of the other should be attended with that health which makes all its other discomforts light on the comparison And hence a third proverb Betty since you are an admirer of proverbs  Better a bare foot than none at all  that is to say than not to be able to walk  She was mightily taken with what I said See said she what a fine thing scholarship isI said she had always from a girl a taste for reading tho' it were but in  Mother Goose  and concerning the  Fairies  And then she took genteelly a pinch of snuff Could but my parents  have let go as fast as I pulled  I should have been a very happy creature  Very likely you would have made great improvements Betty But as it is I cannot say but since I  have had the favour of your attendance in this  intimate  manner I have heard smarter things from you than I have heard at table from some of my brother's fellowcollegians  Your servant dear Miss dropping me one of her best courtesies So fine a judge as you areIt is enough to make one very proud Then with another pinchI cannot indeed but say bridling upon it that I have heard famous scholars often and often say very silly things Things I should be ashamed myself to sayBut I thought they did it out of humility and in condescension to those who had not their learning  That she might not be too proud I told her I would observe that the liveliness and quickness she so happily discovered in herself was not so much an honour to her as what she owed to her  Sex  which as I had observed in many instances had great advantages over the other in all the powers that related to imagination And hence Mrs Betty you'll take notice as I have of late had opportunity to do that your own talent at repartee and smartness when it has  something to work upon  displays itself to more advantage than could well be expected from one whose friends to speak in your own phrase could not  let go so fast as you pulled    The wench gave me a proof of the truth of my observation in a manner still more alert than I had expected If said she our sex have so much advantage in  smartness  it is the less to be wondered at that  you  Miss who have had such an education should outdo all the men and women too that come near you  Bless me Betty said I what a proof do you give me of your wit and your courage at the same time This is outdoing yourself It would make young Ladies less proud and more apprehensive were they generally attended by such smart servants and their  mouths permitted to be unlocked upon them as yours has lately been upon meBut take away Mrs Betty  Why Miss you have eat nothing at allI hope you are not displeased with your dinner for any thing I have said  No Mrs Betty I am pretty well used to your freedoms now you knowI am not displeased in the main to observe that were the succession of modern fine Ladies to be extinct it might be supplied from those whom they place in the next rank to themselves their chambermaids and confidants Your young mistress has contributed a great deal to this quickness of yours She always preferred your company to mine As  you pulled she let go  and so Mrs Betty you have gained by  her  conversation what I have lost  Why Miss if you come to that nobody says better things than Miss Harlowe I could tell you one if  I pleased  upon my observing to her that you lived of late upon air and had no stomach to any thing yet looked as charmingly as ever  I dare say it was a very goodnatured one Mrs BettyDo you then  please  that I shall hear it  Only this Miss  That your stomachfulness had swallowed up your stomach  and  That obstinacy was meat drink and cloth to you    Ay Mrs Betty and  did  she say ThisI hope she laughed when she said it as she does at all her  good things  as she calls them It was very smart and very witty I wish my mind were so much at ease as to aim at being witty too But if you admire such sententious sayings I'll help you to another and that is  Encouragement and Approbation make people shew talents they were never suspected to have  and This will do both for mistress and maid And another I'll furnish you with the contrary of the former that will do only for me That  Persecution  and Discouragement depress  ingenuous  minds and blunt the edge of lively imaginations  And hence may my sister's Brilliancy and my Stupidity be both accounted for  Ingenuous  you must know Mrs Betty and  ingenious  are two things and I would not arrogate the latter to myself  Lord Miss said the Foolish you know a great deal for your yearsYou are a very learned young LadyWhat pity  None of your  pities  Mrs Betty I know what you'd say But tell me if you can Is it resolved that I shall be carry'd to my uncle Antony's on Thursday  I was willing to reward myself for the patience she had made me exercise by getting at what intelligence I could from her  Why Miss seating herself at a little distance excuse my sitting down with the snuffbox tapp'd very smartly the lid opened and a pinch taken with a dainty finger and thumb the other three fingers distendedly bent and with a fine flourishI cannot but say that it is my opinion you will certainly go on Thursday and this  noless foless  as I have heard my young Lady say in FRENCH  Whether I am  willing  or  not willing  you mean I suppose Mrs Betty  You have it Miss  Well but Betty I have no mind to be turned out of doors so suddenly Do you think I could not be permitted to tarry one week longer  How can I tell Miss  O Mrs Betty you can tell a great deal if  you please  But here I am forbid writing to any one of my family none of it now will come near  me  nor will any of it permit me to see  them  How shall I do to make my request known to tarry here a week or fortnight longer  Why Miss I fansy if you were to shew a compliable  temper your friends would shew a compliable one too But would you expect favours and grant none  Smartly put Betty But who knows what may be the result of my being carried to my uncle Antony's  Who knows MissWhy anybody will guess what may be the result  As how Betty  As how  repeated the pert wench Why Miss you will stand in your own light as you have hitherto done And your parents as such good parents  ought  will be obeyed  If Mrs Betty I had not been used to your  oughts  and to have my duty laid down to me by your oraculous wisdom I should be apt to stare at the liberty of your speech  You seem angry Miss I hope I take no unbecoming liberty  If thou really think'st thou dost not thy ignorance is more to be pitied than thy pertness resented I wish thou'd'st leave me to myself  When young Ladies fall out with their  own  duty it is not much to be wondered at that they are angry at anybody who do  theirs    That's a very pretty saying Mrs BettyI see plainly what  thy  duty is in  thy  notion and am obliged to those who taught it thee  Everybody takes notice Miss that you can say very cutting words in a cool manner and yet not call names as I have known  some  gentlefolks as well as others do when in a passion But I wish you had permitted 'Squire Solmes to see you he would have told you such stories of 'Squire Lovelace as would have turned your heart against him for ever  And know you any of the particulars of those sad stories  Indeed I don't but you'll hear all at your uncle Antony's I suppose and a great deal more perhaps than you will like to hear  Let me hear what I will I am determined against Mr Solmes were it to cost me my life  If you are Miss the Lord have mercy on you For what with this letter of yours to 'Squire Solmes whom they so much value and what with their antipathy to 'Squire Lovelace whom they hate they will have no patience with you  What will they do Betty They won't kill me What  will  they do  Kill you NoBut you will not be suffered to stir from thence till you have complied with your duty And  no pen and ink  will be allowed you as here where they are of opinion you make no good use of it Nor would it be allowed here only as they intend so soon to send you away to your uncle's Nobody will be permitted to see you or to correspond with you What farther will be done I can't say and if I could it may not be proper But you may prevent it all by One word And I wish you would Miss All then would be easy and happy And if I may speak my mind I see not why one man is not as good as another Why especially a sober man is not as good as a rake  Well Betty said I sighing all thy impertinence goes for nothing But I see I am destined to be a very unhappy creature Yet will I venture upon one request more to them  And so quite sick of the pert creature and of myself I retired to my closet and wrote a few lines to my uncle Harlowe notwithstanding his prohibition in order to get a reprieve from being carried away so soon as Thursday next if I must go And This that I might if comply'd with suspend the appointment I have made with Mr Lovelace for my heart misgives me as to meeting him and that more and  more I know not why Under the superscription of the letter I wrote these words 'Pray dear Sir 'be pleased to give This a reading  This is the copy of what I wrote  Tuesday Afternoon  Honoured Sir  LET me this once be heard with patience and have my petition granted It is only that I may not be hurried away so soon as next Thursday  Why should the poor girl be turned out of doors so suddenly so disgracefully Procure for me Sir one fortnight's respite In that space of time I hope you will all relent My mamma shall not need to shut her door in apprehension of seeing her disgraced child I will not presume to think of entering her presence or my papa's without leave One fortnight's respite is but a small favour for them to grant except I am to be refused everything I ask But it is of the highest import to my peace of mind Procure it for me therefore dear Sir and you will exceedingly oblige  Your dutiful tho' greatly afflicted Niece CL HARLOWE  I sent this down My uncle was not gone And he now stays to know the result of the question put to me in the inclosed answer which he has given to mine  YOUR going to your uncle's was absolutely concluded upon for next Thursday Nevertheless your mamma seconded by Mr Solmes pleaded so strongly to indulge you that your request for a delay will be comply'd with upon one condition and whether for a fortnight or a shorter time that will depend upon yourself If you refuse this condition your mamma declares she will give over all further intercession for youNor do you deserve  this favour as you put it upon our relenting not your own  This condition is That you admit of a visit from Mr Solmes for one hour in company of your brother your sister or your uncle Antony choose which you will  If you comply not you go next Thursday to a house which is become so strangely odious to you of late whether you get ready to go or not Answer therefore directly to the point No evasion Name your day and hour Mr Solmes will neither eat you nor drink you Let us see whether  we  are to be comply'd with  in any thing  or not  JOHN HARLOWE  After a very little deliberation I resolved to consent to this condition All I fear is that Mr Lovelace's intelligencer may inform him of it and that his apprehensions upon it may make him take some desperate resolution Especially as now having more time given me here I think to write to him to suspend the interview he is possibly so sure of I sent down the following to my uncle  Honoured Sir  ALtho' I see not what end the proposed condition can answer I comply with it I wish I could with every thing expected of me If I must name one in whose company I am to see the gentleman and that one  not  my mamma whose presence I could wish to be honoured by on the occasion let my uncle if he pleases be the  person  If I must name the  day  a long day I doubt▪ will not be permitted me let it be next Tuesday The  hour  four in the afterternoon The  place  either the ivysummerhouse or in the little parlour I used to be permitted to call mine  Be pleased Sir nevertheless to prevail upon my  mamma to vouchsafe me her presence on the occacasion I am Sir  Your everdutiful CL HARLOWE  A reply is just sent me I thought it became my averseness to this meeting to name a distant day But I did not expect they would have comply'd with it So here is one week gain'dThis is it  YOU have done well to comply We are willing to think the best of every slight instance of your duty Yet have you seem'd to consider the day as an evil day and so put it far off This nevertheless is granted you as no time need to be lost if you are as generous  after  the d  y as we are condescending  before  it Let me advise you not to harden your mind nor take up your resolution beforehand Mr Solmes has more awe and even terror at the thoughts of seeing you than you can have at the thoughts of seeing him  His  motive is  Love  let not  yours  be  Hatred  My brother Antony will be present in hopes you will deserve well of  him  by behaving well to the friend of the family See you use him as such Your mamma had permission to be there if she thought fit But says she would not for a thousand pounds unless you would encourage her beforehand as she wishes to be encouraged One hint I am to give you mean time It is this To make a discreet use of your pen and ink Methinks a young creature of niceness should be less ready to write to one man when she is designed to be another's  This compliance I hope will produce greater and then the peace of the family will be restored Which is what is heartily wished by  Your loving Uncle JOHN HARLOWE  Unless it be to the purpose our hearts are set upon you need not write again  This man have  more terror at seeing me than I can have at seeing him  How can that be If he had half as much he would not wish to see meHIS  motive Love  Yes indeed Love of himselfHe knows no otherFor Love that deserves the name seeks the satisfaction of the beloved object more than its ownWeighed in this scale what a profanation is this man guilty of  Not to take up my resolution beforehand  That advice comes too late  But I must  make a discreet use of my pen  That I doubt as they have managed it in the sense they mean it is as much cut of my power as the other  But  to write to one man when I am designed for another  What a shocking expression is That  Repenting of my appointment with Mr Lovelace  before  I had this favour granted me you may believe I hesitated not a moment about revoking it  now  that I had gained such a respite Accordingly I wrote  'That I found it inconvenient to meet him as I had intended That the risque I should run of a discovery and the mischiefs that might flow from it could not be justified by any end that such a meeting could answer That I found one certain servant more in my way when I took my morning and evening airings than any other That he knew not but that the person who might betray the secrets of a family to  him  might be equally watchful to oblige those whom he ought to oblige and so if opportunity were given him might betray me or him to them That I had not been used to a conduct so faulty as to lay myself at the mercy of servants And was sorry he had measures to pursue that made steps necessary in his own opinion which in mine were very culpable and which no end could justify That things drawing towards a crisis between me and my friends an interview could avail nothing especially as the method by which this correspondence  was carried on was not suspected and he could write all that was in his mind to write That I expected to be at liberty to judge of what was proper and fit upon this occasion Especially as he might be assured that I would sooner choose death than Mr Solmes'  Tuesday Night  I HAVE deposited my letter to Mr Lovelace Threatening as things look against me I am much better pleased with myself than I was before I reckon he will be a little out of humour upon it however But as I reserved to myself the liberty of changing my mind and as it is easy for him to imagine there may be reasons for it  within  doors which he cannot judge of  without  and I have suggested to him some of them I should think it strange if he acquiesces not on this occasion with a chearfulness which may shew me that his last letter is the genuine product of his heart For if he be really so much concerned at his past faults as he pretends and has for some time pretended must he not of course have corrected in some degree the impetuosity of his temper The first step to reformation as I conceive is to subdue sudden gusts of passion from which frequently the greatest evils arise and to learn to bear disappointments If the irascible passions cannot be overcome what opinion shall one have of the person's power over those to which bad habit joined to  greater  temptation gives stronger force  Pray my dear be so kind as to make inquiry by some safe hand after the disguises Mr Lovelace assumes at the inn he puts up at in the poor village of Neale he calls it If it be the same I take it to be I never knew it was considerable enough to have a name nor that it has an inn in it  As he must be much there to be so constantly near us I would be glad to have some account of his behaviour  and what the people think of him In such a length of time he must give scandal or hope of reformation Pray my dear humour me in this inquiry I have reasons for it which you shall be acquainted with another time if the result of the inquiry discover them not  LETTER XIX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Wednesday Morning Nine o'clock  I AM just return'd from my morning walk and already have received a letter from Mr Lovelace in answer to mine deposited last night He must have had pen ink and paper with him for it was written in the coppice with this circumstance On one knee kneeling with the other Not from reverence to the writtento however as you'll find  Well are we instructed early to keep this sex at a distance An undesigning open heart where it is loth to disoblige is easily drawn in I see to oblige more than ever it designed It is too apt to govern itself by what a bold spirit is encouraged to  expect  of it It is very difficult for a good natured young person to give a negative where it disesteems not  One's heart may harden and contract as one gains experience and when we have smarted perhaps for our easy folly And so it  ought  or it would be upon very unequal terms with the world  Excuse these grave reflections This man has vex'd me heartily I see his gentleness was  art  fierceness and a temper like what I have been too much used to at home are  nature  in him In the mind I am in nothing shall ever make me forgive him since there can be no good reason for his impatience on an expectation given with reserve and absolutely revocable    I  so much to suffer  thro'  him yet to be treated as if I were obliged to bear insults  from  him  But here you will be pleased to read his letter which I shall inclose  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Good God  WHAT is now to become of meHow shall I support this disappointmentNo new causeOn one knee kneeling with the other I writeMy feet benumbed with midnight wanderings thro' the heaviest dews that ever fell My wig and my linen dripping with the hoarfrost dissolving on themDay but just breakingSun not risen to exhaleMay it never rise againUnless it bring healing and comfort to a benighted soulIn proportion to the joy you had inspired ever lovely promiser in such proportion is my anguish  And  are things drawing towards a crisis between your friends and you  Is not this a reason for me to expect the  rather  to expect the promised interview  CAN  I write all that is in my mind  say youImpossibleNot the hundredth part of what is in my mind and in my apprehension can I write  O the wavering the changeable sexBut can Miss Clarissa Harlowe  Forgive me MadamI know not what I writeYet I must I do insist upon your promiseOr that you will condescend to find better excuses for the failureOr convince me that stronger reasons are imposed upon  you  than those you offerA promise  once  given upon  deliberation  giventhe promise  ed  only can dispense withor some very apparent necessity imposed upon the promise  er  which leaves no power to perform it  The first promise you ever made me Life and  Death perhaps depending upon itMy heart desponding from the barbarous methods resolved to be taken with you in malice to me  You would sooner choose death than Solmes  How my soul spurns the competition O my beloved creature what are these but  wordsWhose  wordsSweet and everadorableWhatPromisebreakermust I call youHow shall I believe the asseveration your supposed Duty in the question Persecution so flaming Hatred to me so strongly avow'd after this instance of your so lightly dispensing with your promise  If my dearest life you would prevent my distraction or at least distracted consequences renew the promised hopeMy  fate  is indeed upon its crisis  Forgive me dearest creature forgive meI know I have written in too much anguish of mindWriting this in the same moment that the justdawning light has imparted to me the heavy disappointment  I dare not reperuse what I have writtenI  must  deposite itIt may serve to shew you my distracted apprehensions that This disappointment is but a prelude to the greatest of AllNor having here any other paper am I able to write again if I would on this gloomy spot Gloomy is my soul and all nature round me partakes of my gloomI trust it therefore to your goodness If its fervor excites your displeasure rather than your pity you wrong my passion and I shall be ready to apprehend that I am intended to be the sacrifice of more miscreants than oneHave patience with me dearest creatureI mean Solmes and your Brother onlyBut if exerting your usual generosity you will excuse and  re  appoint may That God whom you profess to serve and who is the God of  Truth  and of  Promises  protect  and bless you for both and for restoring to Himself and to Hope  Your everadoring yet almost desponding LOVELACE  IvyCavern in the Coppice  day but just breaking  This is the Answer I shall return  Wednesday Morning  I AM amazed Sir at the freedom of your reproaches Pressed and teazed against convenience and inclination to give you a private meeting am  I  to be thus challeng'd and upbraided and my Sex reflected upon because I thought it prudent to change my mindA liberty I had reserved to myself when I made the  appointment  as you call it I wanted not instances of your impatient spirit to other people yet may it be happy for me that I have this new one which shews that you can as little spare  me  when I pursue the dictates of my own reason as you do  others  for acting up to theirs Two motives you must be governed by in this excess The one  my easiness  the other  your own presumption  Since you think you have found out the  first  and have shewn so much of the  last  upon it I am too much alarmed not to wish and desire that your letter of this day may conclude all the trouble you have had from or for  Your humble Servant CL HARLOWE  I BELIEVE my dear I may promise myself your approbation whenever I write or speak with spirit be it to whom it will Indeed I find but too much reason to exert it since I have to deal with people who measure their conduct to me not by what is fit or decent right or wrong but by what they think my  temper will bear I have till very lately been praised for mine but it has always been by those who never gave me opportunity to return the compliment to themselves Some people have acted as if they thought forbearance on  one side  absolutely necessary for them and me to be upon good terms together and in this case have ever taken care rather to  owe  that obligation than to  lay  it You have hinted to me that resentment is not natural to my temper and that therefore it must soon subside It may be so with respect to my relations But not to Mr Lovelace I assure you  Wednesday Noon March  WE cannot always answer for what we  can  do But to convince you that I can keep my above resolution with regard to This Lovelace angry as my letter is and three hours as it is since it was written I assure you that I repent it not nor will soften it altho' I find it is not taken away And yet I hardly ever before did anything in anger that I did not repent in half an hour and question myself in  less  than that time whether I was right or wrong  In this respite till Tuesday I have a little time to look about me as I may say and consider of what I  have  to do and  can  do And Mr Lovelace's insolence will make me go very home with myself Not that I think I can conquer my aversion to Mr Solmes I am sure I cannot But if I absolutely break with Mr Lovelace and give my friends convincing proofs of it who knows but they will restore me to their favour and let their views in relation to the other man go off by degreesOr at least that I may be safe till my cousin Morden arrives To whom I think I will write and the rather as Mr Lovelace has assured me that my friends have written to him to make good their side of the question  But with all my courage I am exceedingly apprehensive  about Tuesday next and about what may result from my stedfastness for stedfast I am sure I shall be They are resolved I am told to try every means to induce me to comply with what they are determin'd upon I am resolved to do the like to avoid what they would force me to do A dreadful contention between parents and childEach hopeing to leave the other without excuse whatever the consequence may be  What can I do Advise me my dear Something is strangely wrong somewhere to make parents the most indulgent till now seem cruel in a child's eye and a daughter till within these few weeks thought unexceptionably dutiful appear in their judgment a rebelO my ambitious and violent brotherWhat may he have to answer for to both  Be pleased to remember my dear that your last favour was dated on Saturday This is Wednesday And none of mine have been taken away since Don't let me want  your  advice My situation is extremely difficultBut I am sure you love me still▪ And not the less on  that  account Adieu my beloved friend  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XX Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday Morning Daybreak March  AN accident has occasioned my remissness as till you know it you may justly think my silence  My mamma was sent for on Sunday night with the utmost earnestness by her cousin Larkin whom I mentioned in one of my former  This poor woman was always afraid of Death and was one of those weak persons who imagine that the  making of their Will must be an undoubted forerunner of it  She had always said when urged to the necessary work That whenever she made it she should not live long after and one would think imagined she was under an obligation to prove her words For tho' she had been long bedrid and was in a manner worn out before yet she thought herself better till she was persuaded to make it And from that moment remembering what she used to prognosticate her  fears helping on what she feared  as is often the case particularly in the SmallPox grew worse and had it in her head once to burn her Will in hopes to grow better upon it  She sent my mamma word That the Doctors had given her over But that she could not die till she saw her I told my mamma That if she wish'd her a chance for recovery she should not for  that  reason go But go she would and what was worse would make me go with her and that at an hour's warning Had there been more time for argumentation to be sure I had not gone for she said nothing of it to me till she was rising in the morning  early  resolving to return  at night  So that there was a kind of necessity that my preparation to obey her should in a manner accompany her commandA command so much out of the way on such a solemn occasion And this I representedBut to no purposeThere never was such a contradicting girl in the world  My  wisdom always made  her  a foolBut she  would  be obliged  this time  proper or improper  I have but one way of accounting for this sudden whim of my mammaShe had a mind to accept of Mr Hickman's offer to escorte herAnd I verily believe I wish I were quite sure of it had a mind to oblige him with my companyas far as I know to keep me out of  worse    For would you believe itAs sure as you are  alive she is afraid for her favourite Hickman because of the long visit your Lovelace tho' so much by accident made me in her absence last time she was at the same place I hope my dear  you  are not jealous too But indeed I now and then when she teazes me with praises which Hickman cannot deserve in return fall to praising those qualities and personalities in Lovelace which the other never will have Indeed I do love to teaze a little bit that I doMy mamma's girlI had like to have said  As you know she is as passionate as I am pert you will not wonder to be told that we generally fall out on these occasions She flies from me at the long run It would be undutiful in me to leave her  first  And then I get an opportunity to pursue our  correspondence    For now I am rambling let me tell you that she does not much favour  that  for  two  reasons I believe One that I don't shew her all that passes between us the other That she thinks I harden your mind against your duty as it is called and with  her  for a reason at home as I have hinted more than once parents cannot do wrong children cannot oppose and be right This obliges me nowandthen to  steal  an hour as I may say and not let her know how I am employ'd  You may guess from what I have written how averse I was to comply with this stretch of motherly authority made so much against rhyme and reasonBut it came to be a  test of duty  so I was obliged to yield tho' with a full persuasion of being in the right  I have always your reproofs upon these occasions In your late letters stronger than ever A good reason why you'll say Because more deserved than ever I thank you kindly for your correction I hope to make  cor  rection of itBut let me tell you that  your stripe's whether deserved or not have made me sensible deeper than the skinBut of this another time  It was Monday afternoon before we reached the old gentlewoman's That fiddling parading fellow you know who I mean made us wait for him two hours and I to go a journey I disliked only for the sake of having a little more tawdry upon his housings which he had hurry'd his saddler to put on to make him look fine being to escorte his dear Madam Howe and her fair daughterI told him that I supposed he was afraid that the double solemnity in the case that of the visit to a dying woman and that of his own countenance would give him the appearance of an  undertaker  to avoid which he ran into as bad an extreme and I doubted would be taken for a  mountebank    The man was confounded He took it as strongly as if his conscience gave assent to the justice of the remarkOtherwise he would have borne it better For he is used enough to this sort of treatment I thought he would have cry'd I have heretofore observed that on this side of the contract he seems to be a mighty meek sort of creatureAnd tho' I should like it in him  hereafter  perhaps yet I can't help despising him a little in my heart for it  now  I believe my dear we all love your blustering fellows best could we but direct the bluster and bid it roar when and at whom we pleased  The poor man looked at my mamma She was so angry My airs upon it and my opposition to the journey having all helped that for half the way she would not speak to me And when she did it was I wish I had not brought youYou know not what it is to condescend It is  my  fault not  Mr Hickman  's that you are here so much against your willHave you no eyes for this side of the chariot  And then he far'd the better from  her  as he always  does for faring worse from  me  For there was how do you  now  Sir And how do you  now  Mr Hickman as he ambled now on this side of the chariot now on that stealing a prim look at me  her  head half out of the chariot kindly smiling as if marry'd to the man but a fortnight herself While I always saw something to divert myself on the side of the chariot where the honest man was not were it but old Robin at a distance on his Roan Keffel  Our courtshipdays they say are our best days Favour destroys courtship Distance increases it Its essence is distance And to see how familiar these menwretches grow upon a smile what an awe they are struck into when one frowns Who would not make them stand off Who would not enjoy a power that is to be so shortlived  Don't chide me one bit for this my dear It is in nature I can't help it Nay for that matter I love it and wish not to help it So spare your gravity I beseech you on this subject I set not up for a perfect character The man will bear it And what need you care My mamma overbalances all he suffers And if he thinks himself unhappy he ought never to be otherwise  Then did he not deserve a fit of the sullens think you to make us lose our dinner for his parade since in so short a journey one would not bait and lose the opportunity of coming back that night had the old gentlewoman's condition permitted it To say nothing of being the cause that my mamma was in the glout with her poor daughter all the way  At our alighting I gave him another dab but it was but a little one Yet the manner and the air made up as I intended they should for that defect My mamma's hand was kindly put into his with a simpering altogether bridal and with another How do you now SirAll his plump muscles were in motion and a double charge of care and obsequiousness  fidgetted up his whole form when he offer'd to me his officious palm My mamma when I was a girl always bid me hold up my head I just then remember'd her commands and was dutiful I never held up my head so high With an averted supercilious eye and a rejecting hand halfflourishingI have no need of help SirYou are in my way  He ran back as if on wheels with a face excessively mortify'd I had thoughts else to have follow'd the too gentle touch with a declaration that I had as many hands and feet as himself But this would have been telling him a piece of news as to the latter that I hope he had not the presumption to guess at  WE found the poor woman as we thought at the last gasp Had we come  sooner  we could not have got away as we intended that night You see I am for excusing the man all I can and yet I assure you I have not so much as a  conditional liking  to him My mamma sat up most part of the night expecting every hour would have been her poor cousin's last I bore her company till two  I never saw the approaches of death in a grown person before and was extremely shock'd Death to one in health is a very terrible thing We pity the person for what  she  suffers And we pity ourselves for what  we  must some time hence in like sort suffer and so are  doubly  affected  She held out till Tuesday morning eleven and having told my mamma that she had left her an executrix and her and me rings and mourning we were employ'd all that day in matters of the Will By which my cousin Jenny Fynnett is handsomely provided for so that it was Wednesday morning early before we set out on our return  It is true we got home having no housings to stay for by noon But tho' I sent Robin away before  he alitt and he brought me back a whole packet down to the same Wednesday noon yet was I really so fatigued and shock'd as I must own at the hard death of the old gentlewoman my mamma likewise who has no reason to dislike this world being indisposed from the same occasion that I could not set about writing time enough for Robin's return that night  But having recruited my spirits my mamma having also had a good night I arose with the dawn to write this and get it dispatched time enough for your breakfastairing that your suspense may be as short as possible  I WILL soon follow This with another I will employ a person directly to find out how Lovelace behaves himself at his inn Such a busy spirit must be traceable  But perhaps my dear you are indifferent now about him or his employments for this request was made before he  mortally  offended you Nevertheless I will have inquiry made The result it is very probable will be of use to confirm you in your present unforgiving temperAnd yet if the  poor  man Shall I pity him for  you  my dear should be depriv'd of the greatest blessing any man on earth can receive and which he has the presumption with so little merit to aspire to he will have run great risques caught great colds hazarded fevers sustained the highest indignities brav'd the inclemencies of skies and all fornothingWill not this move your  generosity  if nothing else in his favourPoor Mr Lovelace  I would occasion no throb nor halfthrob no flash of sensibility like lightning darting in and as soon suppress'd by a discretion that no one of the Sex ever before could give such an example ofI  would not  I say and yet for a trial of  you  to  yourself  rather than as an impertinent overflow of raillery in your friend as moneytakers try a suspected guinea by the  sound  let me on such a supposition sound  you  by repeating  Poor Mr Lovelace    And now my dear how is it with you How do you now as my mamma says to Mr Hickman when her pert daughter has made him look sorrowful  LETTER XXI Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday Morning  I Will now take some notice of your last favour But being so far behindhand with you must be brief  In the first place as to your reproofs thus shall I discharge myself of that part of my subject Is it likely think you that I should avoid deserving them nowandthen occasionally when I admire the manner in which you give me your rebukes and love you the better for them And when you are so well  intitled  to give them For what faults can  you  possibly have unless your relations are so kind as to find you a  few  to keep their  many  in countenanceBut They are as kind to  me  in This as to  you  for I may venture to affirm That any one who should read  your  letters and would say you were  right  would not on reading  mine  condemn me for being  quite wrong    Your resolution not to leave your father's house is rightif you can stay in it and avoid being Solmes's wife  I think you answer'd Solmes's letter as  I  should have answer'd itWill you not compliment me and yourself at once by saying that  That  was right  You have in your letters to your uncle and the rest done all that you ought to do You are wholly guiltless of the consequence be it what it will To offer to give up your estateThat would not I have doneYou see this offer stagger'd them They took time to consider of it They made my heart ake in the time they took I was afraid they would have taken you at your word And so but for shame and for fear of Lovelace I dare say they wouldYou are too noble by half for them This I repeat is an offer I would not have made Let me beg of you my dear never to repeat the temptation to them  I freely own to you that their usage of you upon it and Lovelace's different behaviour in his letter received at the same time would have made  me  his past redemption The duce take the man I was going to say for not having had so much regard to his character and morals as would have intirely justify'd such a step in a  Clarissa Harlowe  persecuted as she is  I wonder not at your appointment with him I may further touch upon some part of this subject byandby  Pray pray I pray you now my dearest friend contrive to send your Betty Barnes to meDoes the Coventryact extend to women know yeThe least I would do should be to send her home well soused in and dragged thro' our deepest horsepond I'll engage if I get her hither that she shall keep the anniversary of her deliverance as long as she lives  I wonder not at Lovelace's saucy answer saucy as it really is If he loves you as he ought he must be vex'd at so great a disappointment The man must have been a detestable hypocrite I think had he not shewn his vexation Your expectations of such a Christian command of temper in him in a disappointment of this nature especially are too early by  almost half a century in a man of his constitution But nevertheless I am very far from blaming you for your resentment  I shall be all impatience to know how this matter ends between you and him But a  few inches of brickwall  between you so lately and now such  mountains  And you think to hold itMay be so  You see the temper he shew'd in his preceding letter was not  natural  to him you say And did you before think it  was  Insolent creepers and insinuators Inchallow'd elltaking incroachersThis very Hickman I make no doubt will be as saucy as your Lovelace if ever he dare He has not half the arrogant bravery of the other and can better hide his horns that's all But whenever he has the power depend upon it he will  butt  at one as valiantly as the other  If ever I should be persuaded to have him I shall watch how the imperative Husband  comes upon him  how the obsequious Lover  goes off  in short how he  ascends  and how I  descend  in the matrimonial wheel never to take my turn again but by fits and starts like the feeble struggles of a sinking state for its dying liberty  All goodnatured men are passionate  says Mr Lovelace A pretty plea to a beloved object in the plenitude of her power As much as to say Greatly as I value you Madam I will not take pains to curb my passions to oblige youMethinks I should be glad to hear from Mr Hickman such a plea for goodnature as this  Indeed we are too apt to make allowances for such tempers as  early  indulgence has made uncontroulable and therefore habitually evil But if a boistrous temper when under  obligation  is to be thus allowed for what when the tables are turned will it expect You know a husband who I fancy  had some of these early allowances made for him And you see that neither himself nor anybody else is the happier for it  The suiting of the tempers of two persons who are to come together is a great matter And yet there should be boundaries fixed between them by consent as it were beyond which neither should go And each should hold the other to it or there would probably be incroachments in both If the boundaries of the Three Estates that constitute our Political Union were not known and occasionally asserted what would become of each The two branches of the Legislature would incroach upon each other and the Executive power would swallow up both  If two persons of discretion you'll say come tother  Ay my dear that's true But if none but persons of discretion were to marryAnd would it not surprise you if I were to advance that the persons of discretion are generally singleSuch persons are apt to consider too much to resolveAre not you and I complimented as suchAnd would either of us marry if the fellows and our friends would let us alone  But to the former pointHad Lovelace made his addresses to me unless indeed I had been taken with a liking for him  more  than  conditional  I would have forbid him upon the first  passionate  instance of his  goodnature  as he calls it ever to see me more  'Thou must bear with me honest friend might I have said had I condescended to say any thing to him an hundred times more than ThisBegone thereforeI bear with no passions that are predominant to That thou hast pretended for me'  But to one of  your  mild and gentle temper it would be all one were you marry'd whether the man be a Lovelace or a Hickman in his spiritYou are so obediently principled that perhaps you would  have told a mild man that he must not  intreat  but  command  and that it was beneath him not to exact from you the obedience you had so solemnly vow'd to him at the altarI know of old my dear your meek regard to that little piddling part of the marriagevow which some prerogativemonger foisted into the office to make That a  duty  which he knew was not a  right    Our way of trainingup  you say  makes us need the protection of the brave  Very true And how extremely brave and gallant is it that this brave man will free us from all insults but Those which will go nearest to us that is to say His own  How artfully has Lovelace in the abstract you give me of one of his letters calculated to your meridian  Generous spirits hate compulsion  He is certainly a deeper creature by much than once we thought him He knows as you intimate that his own wild pranks cannot be concealed and so owns just enough to palliate because it teaches you not to be surprised at any new one that may come to your ears and then truly he is however faulty a mighty  ingenuous  man and by no means an  hypocrite  A character when found out the most odious of all others to  our sex  in the  other  were it only because it teaches us to doubt the justice of the praises such a man gives us when we are willing to believe them to be our due  By means of this supposed  ingenuity  Lovelace obtains a praise instead of a merited dispraise and like an absolved confessionaire wipes off as he goes along one score to begin another For an eye favourable to him will not magnify his faults nor will a woman willing to  hope the best  forbear to impute to illwill and prejudice all t  at charity can make so imputable And if she even give credit to such of the unfavourable imputations as may be too flagrant to be doubted she will be very apt to take in the  future hope    which he inculcates and which to question would be to question her own power and perhaps  merit  And thus may a woman be inclined to make a  slight  or even a  fancied  virtue atone for the most  glaring  vice  I have a reason a new one for this preachment upon a text you have given me But till I am better inform'd I will not explain myself If it come out as I shrewdly suspect it will the man my dear is a devil and you must rather think ofI protest I had like to have said  Solmes  than him  But let This be as it will shall I tell you how after all his offences he may creep in with you again  I willThus then It is but to claim for himself the  goodnatur'd character  And This granted will blot out the fault of  passionate  insolence And so he will have nothing to do but This hour to accustom you to insult the Next to bring you to forgive him upon his submission The consequence will be that he will by this seesaw teazing break your resentment all to pieces And then a little  more  of the insult and a little  less  of the submission on his part will go down till nothing else but the  first  will be seen and not a bit of the  second  You will then be afraid to provoke so offensive a spirit and at last will be brought so  prettily  and so  audibly  to pronounce the little reptile word OBEY that it will do one's heart good to hear you The  Muscovite  wife takes place of the  managed  mistressAnd if you doubt the progression be pleased my dear to take your  mamma  's judgment upon it  But no more of This just now Your story is become too arduous to dwell upon these sort of topics And yet this is but an  affected levity  with me My heart as I have heretofore said is a sincere sharer in all your distresses My sunshine darts but thro' a drizly cloud My eye were you to see it when it seems to you so  gladden'd  as you mention in a former is more than ready to overflow even at the  very passages perhaps upon which you impute to me the  archness  of  exultation    But now the unheard of cruelty and perverseness of some of your friends  Relations  I should say I am always blundering thus the  as  strange determinedness of others your present quarrel with Lovelace and your approaching interview with Solmes from which you are right to apprehend a great deal are such considerable circumstances in your story that it is fit they should ingross all my attention  You ask me to advise you how to behave upon Solmes's visit I  cannot  for my life I know they expect a great deal from it You had not else had your long day comply'd with All I will say is That if Solmes cannot be prevailed for now that Lovelace has so much offended you he never will When the interview is over I doubt not but that I shall have reason to say that All you did that All you said was right and could not be better Yet if I don't think so I won't say so that I promise you  Only let me advise you to pull up a spirit even to your uncle if there be occasion Resent the vile and foolish treatment you meet with in which he has taken so large a share and make him asham'd of it if you can  I know not upon recollection but This interview may be a good thing for you however design'd For when Solmes sees if that is to  be  so that it is impossible he should succeed with you and your relations see it too the one must I think recede and the other come to terms with you upon offers that it is my opinion will go hard enough with you to comply with when the  still  harder are dispensed with  There are several passages in your last letters as well as in your former which authorize me to say This But it would be unseasonable to touch this subject further just now  But upon the whole I have no patience to see you thus made the sport of your brother's and sister's cruelty For what after so much steadiness on your part in so many trials can be their hope  I approve of your intention to send out of their reach all the letters and papers you would not have them see Methinks I would wish you to deposite likewise a parcel of cloaths linen c before your interview with Solmes lest you should not have an opportunity for it afterwards Robin shall fetch it away on the first orders by day or by night  I am in hopes to procure from my mamma if things come to extremity leave for you to be privately with us  I will condition to be goodhumour'd and even  kind  to HER favourite if she will shew me an indulgence that shall make me serviceable to MINE It has been a good while in my head But I cannot promise that I shall succeed in it  Don't absolutely despair however my dear Your quarrel with Lovelace may be a help to it And the offers you made in your answer to your uncle Harlowe's letter of Sunday night last may be another  I depend upon your forgiveness of all the perhaps unseasonable flippancies of your naturally too lively yet most sincerely sympathizing  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Friday March  YOU have very kindly accounted for your silence People in misfortune are always in doubt They are too apt to turn even unavoidable accidents into slights and neglects especially in those whose favourable opinion they wish to preserve  I am sure I ought evermore to exempt my Anna Howe from the supposed possibility of her becoming one of those who bask only in the sunshine of a friend But nevertheless her friendship is too precious to me not to doubt my own merits on the one hand and not to be anxious for the preservation of it on the other  You so generously give me liberty to chide you that I am afraid of taking it because I could sooner mistrust my own judgment than that of a beloved friend whose ingenuity in acknowleging an  imputed  error sets her above the commission of a  wilful  one This makes me half afraid to ask you If you think you are not too cruel too  ungenerous  shall I say in your behaviour to a man who loves you so dearly and is so worthy and so sincere a man  Only it is by YOU or I should be asham'd to be outdone in that true magnanimity which makes one thankful for the wounds given by a true friend I believe I was guilty of a petulance which nothing but my uneasy situation can excuse if  that  can I am almost  afraid  to beg of you and yet I repeatedly  do  to give way to that charming spirit whenever it rises to your pen which smiles yet goes to the quick of one's fault What patient shall be afraid of a probe in so delicate a handI say I am almost afraid to pray you to give way to it for fear you should for that very reason restrain it For the edge may he taken off if it does not make the subject of its raillery wince a little  Permitted  or  desired  satire may be apt in a generous satirist mending as it raillies to turn too soon into panegyric Yours is intended to instruct and tho' it bites it pleases at the same time No fear of a wound's rankling or festering by so delicate a point as you carry not invenom'd by  personality  not intending to expose or ridicule or exasperateThe most admired of our moderns know nothing of this art Why Because it must be founded  in goodnature and directed by a right heart The  man  not the  fault  is the subject of  their  satire And were it to be  just  how should it be  useful  How should it answer any good purpose When every gash for their weapon is a Broadsword not a Lancet lets in the air of public ridicule and exasperates where it should heal Spare me not therefore because I am your  friend  For  that  very reason spare me not I may  feel  your edge fine as it is I may be pained You would lose your end if I were not But after the first sensibility as I have said more than once before I will love you the better and my amended heart shall be all yours and it will then be more worthy to be yours  You have taught me what to say to and what to think of Mr Lovelace You have by agreeable anticipation let me know how it is probable he will apply to me to be excus'd I will lay every thing before you that shall pass on the occasion if he  does  apply that I may take your advice when it can come in time and when it cannot that I may receive your correction or approbation as I may happen to merit eitherOnly one thing must be allow'd for me that whatever course I shall be  permitted  or he  forced  to steer I must be considered as a person out of her own direction Tost to and fro by the high winds of passionate controul and as I think unreasonable severity I behold the desired Port the  single state  which I would fain steer into but am kept off by the foaming billows of a brother's and sister's envy and by the raging winds of a supposed invaded authority while I see in Lovelace the Rocks on one hand and in Solmes the Sands on the other and tremble lest I should split upon the former or strike upon the latter  But you my better pilot what a charming hope do you bid me aspire to if things come to extremityI will not as you caution me too much  depend upon your success with your mamma in my favour For well I know her high notions of implicit duty in a childBut yet I will  hope  toobecause her seasonable protection may save me perhaps from a greater rashness And in This case see shall direct all my ways I will do nothing but by her orders and by her advice and yours Not see anybody Not write to anybody Nor shall any living soul but by her direction and yours know where I am In any cottage place me I will never stir out unless disguised as your servant I am nowandthen permitted an eveningwalk with you And this private protection to be granted me for no longer time than till my cousin Morden comes which as I hope cannot be long  I am afraid I must not venture to take the hint you give me to deposite some of my cloaths altho' I will some of my linen as well as papers  I will tell you why Betty had for some time been very curious about my wardrobe whenever I took out any of my things before her  Observing this I once left my keys in the locks on taking one of my gardenairings and on my return surprised the creature with her hand upon the keys as if shutting the door  She was confounded at my sudden coming back I took no notice But on her retiring I found my cloaths did not lie in the usual order  I doubted not upon this that her curiosity was an effect of their orders to her and being afraid they would abridge me of my airings if their suspicions were not obviated it has ever since been my custom among other contrivances not only to leave my keys in the locks but to employ the wench nowandthen in taking out my cloaths suit by suit on pretence of preventing their being rumpled or creased and to see that the flower'd silver suit did not tarnish sometimes declaredly as a wileawaytime having little  else to do With which employment superadded to the delight taken by the low as well as the high of our sex in seeing fine cloaths she seem'd always I thought as well pleased as if it answer'd one of the offices she had in charge  To this and to the confidence they have in a spy so diligent and to their knowing that I have not one confidante in a family where I believe nevertheless every servant in it loves me nor have attempted to make one I suppose I owe the freedom I enjoy of my airings And perhaps finding I make no movements towards going off they are the more secure that I shall at last be prevailed upon to comply with their measures Since they must think that otherwise they give me provocations enough to take some rash step in order to free myself from a treatment so disgraceful and which God forgive me if I judge amiss I am afraid my brother and sister would not be sorry to drive me to take  If therefore such a step should become necessary which I yet hope will not I must be contented to go away with the cloaths I shall have on at the time My custom to be dress'd for the day as soon as breakfast is over when I have had no housholdemployments to prevent me will make such a step if I am forced to take it less suspected And the linen I shall deposite in pursuance of your kind hint cannot be miss'd  This custom altho' a prisoner as I may too truly say and neither visited nor visiting I continue One owes to  one'sself  and to one's  sex  you know to be always neat and never to be surprised in a way one should be pained to be seen in  Besides people in adversity which is the state of trial of every good quality should endeavour to preserve laudable customs that if sunshine return they may not be losers by their trial  Does it not moreover manifest a firmness of mind in an unhappy person to keep hope alive  To  hope  for better days is half to  deserve  them For could we have just ground for such a hope if we did not resolve to deserve what that hope bids us aspire toThen who shall befriend a person who forsakes herselfThese are reflections by which I sometimes endeavour to support myself  I know you don't despise my  grave airs  altho' with a view no doubt to irradiate my mind in my misfortunes you railly me upon them Everybody has not your talent of introducing serious and important lessons in such a happy manner as at once to delight and instruct  What a multitude of contrivances may not young people fall upon if the mind be not engaged by acts of kindness and condescension I am not used by my friends of late as I always used their servants  When I was intrusted with the familymanagement I always found it both generous and just to repose a trust in them Not to seem to expect or depend upon justice from them is in a manner to bid them take opportunities whenever they offer to be  un  just  Mr Solmes to expatiate a little on this low but not unuseful subject in his more trifling solicitudes would have had a sorry keykeeper in me Were I mistress of a family I would not either take to myself or give to servants the pain of keeping those I had reason to suspect People low in station have often minds not sordidNay I have sometimes thought that even take number for number there are more  honest low people  than  honest high  In the one honesty is their  chief  pride In the other the love of power of grandeur of pleasure mislead and that love and their ambition induce a paramount pride which too often swallows up the more laudable one  Many of the former would scorn to deceive a confidence But I have seen among the most ignorant of their class a susceptibility of resentment if their honesty has been suspected And have more than once been forced to put a servant right whom I have heard say That altho' she valued herself upon her  honesty  no master or mistress should suspect her for nothing  How far has the comparison I had in my head between my friends treatment of  me  and my treatment of their  servants  carried me But we always allowed ourselves to expatiate on such subjects whether low or high that might tend to inlarge our minds or mend our management whether notional or practical and whether they respected our present or might respect our probable future situations  What I was principally leading to was to tell you how ingenious I am in my contrivances and pretences to blind my gaoleress and to take off the jealousy of her principals on my going down so often into the garden and poultryyard People suspiciously treated never I believe want invention Sometimes I want  air  and am better the moment I am out of my chamberSometimes  spririts  and then my Bantams and Pheasants or the Cascade divert me the former by their inspiriting liveliness the latter more solemnly by its echoing dashings and hollow murmursSometimes solitude is of all things my wish and the awful silence of the night the spangled element and the rising and setting sun how promotive of contemplationSometimes when I intend nothing and expect not letters I am officious to take Betty with me and at others bespeak her attendance when I know she is otherwise employ'd and cannot give it me  These more capital artifices I branch out into lesser ones without number Yet  all  have not only the face of truth but are real truth altho' not the principal  motive How prompt a thing is  will  What impediments does  dislike  furnishHow swiftly thro' every difficulty do we move with the oneHow tardily with the otherEvery trifling obstruction weighing one down as if lead were fastened to our feet  Friday Morning Eleven o'Clock  I HAVE already made up my parcel of linen my heart aked all the time I was employ'd about it and still akes at the thoughts of its being a necessary precaution  When it comes to your hands as I hope it safely will you will be pleased to open it You will find in it two parcels sealed up one of which contains the letters you have not yet seen being those written since I left you in the other are all the letters and copies of letters that have passed between you and me since I was last with you with some other papers on subjects so much above me that I cannot wish them to be seen by anybody whose indulgence I am not so sure of as I am of yours If my judgment ripen with my years perhaps I may review them  Mrs Norton used to say from her reverend Father that there was one time of life for  imagination  and  fancy  to work in Then were the writer to lay by his works till  riper years  and  experience  should direct the fire rather to  glow  than to  flame out  something between both might perhaps be produced that would not displease a judicious eye  In a third division folded up separately are all Mr Lovelace's letters since he was forbidden this house and copies of my answers to them I expect that you will break the seals of this parcel and when you have perused them all give me your free opinion of my conduct  By the way not a line from that manNot one  lineWednesday I deposited mine It remained there on Wednesday night What time it was taken away yesterday I cannot tell For I did not concern myself about it till towards night and then it was not there No return at ten this day I suppose he is as much out of humour as I With all my heart  He may be mean enough perhaps if ever I should put it into his  power  to avenge himself for the trouble he has had with meBut that now I dare say I never shall  I see what sort of a man the incroacher isAnd I hope we are equally sick of one anotherMy heart is  vexedly  easy if I may so describe it  Vexedly  because of the apprehended interview with Solmes and the consequences it may have Or else I should be  quite  easy for why I have not  deserved  the usage I receiveAnd could I be rid of Solmes as I presume I am of Lovelace  their  influence over my father mother and uncles against me could not hold  The five guineas ty'd up in one corner of a handkerchief under the linen I beg you will let pass as an acknowlegement for the trouble I give your trusty servant You must not chide me my dear You know I cannot be easy unless I have my way in these little matters  I was going to put up what little money I have and some of my ornaments but they are portable and I cannot forget them Besides should they suspecting me desire to see any of the jewels and were I not able to produce them it would amount to a demonstration of an intention which would have a guilty appearance to them  Friday One o'Clock  in the Woodhouse  No letter yet from this manI have luckily deposited my parcel and have your letter of last night  If Robert takes This without the parcel pray let him return immediately for it But he cannot miss it I think and must conclude that it is put there for him to take awayYou may believe from the contents of yours that I shall immediately write again  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XXIII Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday Night March  THE fruits of my inquiry after your abominable

leaveI cannot find a word bad enough  LETTER XXIV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Friday Three o'Clock  YOU incense alarm and terrify me at the same time Hasten my dearest friend hasten to me what further intelligence you can gather about this vilest of men  But never talk of innocence of simplicity and this unhappy girl together Must she not know that such a man as That dignify'd in his very aspect and no disguise able to conceal his being of conditionmust mean too much when he places her at the upper end of his table and calls her by such tender namesWould a girl modest as simple above Seventeen be set a singing at the pleasure of such a man as That A stranger and professedly in disguiseWould her father and grandmother if honest people and careful of their simple girl permit such freedoms  Keep his friend at distance from her  To be sure his  designs  are villainous if they have not been already effected  Warn my dear if not too late the unthinking father of his child's dangerThere cannot be a father in the world who would sell his child's virtueNo motherThe poor thing  I long to hear the result of your intelligence You shall  see  the simple creature you tell meLet me know what sort of a girl it isA  sweet pretty girl  you sayA  sweet  pretty  girl  my dearThey are sweet pretty words from your pen But are they  yours  or  his  of herIf she be so simple if she have Ease and Nature in her manner in her speech and warbles prettily her  wild notes  How affectingly you mention this simple Thing my dear why such a girl as That must engage such a profligate wretch as now indeed I doubt this man is accustom'd perhaps to townwomen and their confident waysMust  deeply  and for a  long season  engage him Since perhaps when her innocence is departed she will endeavour by art to supply the natural charms that engaged him  Fine hopes of such a wretch's reformationI would not my dear for the world have any thing to sayBut I need not make resolutionsI have not open'd nor will I open his letterA sycophant creatureWith his hoarsenessesgot perhaps by a midnight revel singing to his wildnote singerAnd only increased in the coppice  To be already on a footIn his esteem I mean my dearFor myself I despise himI hate myself almost for writing so much about  him  and of such a simpleton as  This sweet pretty girl  But nothing can be either  sweet  or  pretty  that is not modest that is not virtuous  This vile Joseph Leman had given a hint to Betty and she to me as if Lovelace would be found out  to be a very bad man at a place where he had been lately seen in disguise But he would see further he said before he told her more and she promised secrecy in hope to get at further intelligence I thought it could be no harm to get you to inform yourself and me of what could be gather'd And now I see his enemies are but too well warranted in their reports of him And if the ruin of this poor young creature is his aim and if he had not known her but for his visits to Harloweplace I shall have reason to be doubly concerned for her and doubly incensed against so vile a man I think I hate him worse than I do Solmes himselfBut I will not add one other word about him after I have wished to know as soon as possible what further occurs from your inquirybecause I shall not open his letter till then and because then if it come out as I dare say it will I'll directly put the letter unopen'd into the place I took it from and never trouble myself more about him Adieu my dearest friend  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XXV Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Friday Noon March  JUSTICE obliges me to forward This after my last on the wings of the wind as I may sayI really believe the man is innocent Of this  one  accusation I think he must be acquitted and I am sorry I was so forward in dispatching away my intelligence by halves  I have seen the girl She is really a very pretty a very neat and what is still a greater beauty a very innocent young creature He who could have ruin'd such an undesigning homebred must have been indeed  infernally wicked Her father is an honest simple man intirely satisfy'd with his child and with her new acquaintance  I am almost afraid for your heart when I tell you that I find now I have got to the bottom of this inquiry something noble come out in this Lovelace's favour  The girl is to be marry'd next week and This promoted and brought about by him He is resolv'd her father says to make one couple happy and wishes he could make more so There's for you my dear And having taken a liking also to the young fellow whom she professes to love he has given her an hundred pounds The grandmother actually has it in her hands to answer to the like sum given to the youth by one of his own relations While Mr Lovelace's companion attracted by the example has presented twentyfive guineas to the father who is poor towards cloaths to equip the pretty Rustic  They were desirous the poor man says when they first came of appearing beneath themselves but now he knows the one but mention'd it in confidence to be Colonel Barrow the other Capt Sloane The Colonel he owns was at first very  sweet upon his girl  But upon her grandmother's begging of him to spare her innocence he vow'd that he never would offer any thing but good counsel to her and had kept to his word And the pretty fool acknowleged that she never could have been better instructed by the minister himself from the  BibleBook  The girl I own pleased me so well that I made her visit to me worth her while  But what my dear will become of us nowLovelace not only reform'd but turn'd preacherWhat will become of us nowWhy my sweet friend your  generosity  is now engaged in his favourFie upon this  Generosity  I think in my heart that it does as much mischief to the nobleminded  as  Love  to the ignoblerWhat before was only a  conditional liking  I am now afraid will turn to  liking unconditional    I could not endure to turn my invective into panegyric all at once and so soon We or such as I at least love to keep ourselves in countenance for a rash judgment even when we know it to be rash Everybody has not your generosity in confessing a mistake It requires a greatness of soul to do it So I made still farther inquiry after his life and manners and behaviour there in hopes to find something bad But all uniform  Upon the Whole Mr Lovelace comes out with so much advantage from this inquiry that were there the least room for it I should suspect the whole to be a plot set on foot to wash a blackmoor white Adieu my dear  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXVI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Saturday April  HASTY censurers do indeed subject themselves to the charge of variableness and inconsistency in judgment And so they ought for if you even you were really so loth to own a mistake as in the instance before us you pretend to say you were I believe I should not have loved you so well as I really do love you Nor could you my dear have so frankly thrown the reflection I hint at upon yourself had you not had one of the most ingenuous minds that ever woman boasted  Mr Lovelace has faults enow to deserve very severe censure altho' he be not guilty of this If I were upon such terms with him as he would wish me to be I should give him a hint that this treacherous  Joseph Leman cannot be so much his friend as perhaps he thinks him If he had he would not have been so ready to report to his disadvantage and to Betty Barnes too this slight affair of the pretty Rustic Joseph has engaged Betty to secrecy promising to let her and her young master too know more when he knows the whole of the matter And this hinders her from mentioning it as she is nevertheless agog to do to my sister or my brother And then she does not choose to disoblige Joseph for altho' she pretends to look above him she listens I believe to some lovestories he tells her Women having it not in their power to  begin  a courtship some of them very frequently I believe lend an  ear  where their  hearts  incline not  But to say no more of these low people neither of whom I think tolerably of I must needs own that as I should for ever have despised this man had he been capable of such a vile intrigue in his way to Harloweplace and as I believed he  was  capable of it it has indeed engaged my  generosity  as you call it in proportion I  own  it has in his favour Perhaps more than I may have reason to wish it had And railly me as you will pray tell me fairly my dear would it not have had such an effect upon you  Then the real generosity of the actI protest my beloved friend if he would be good for the rest of his life from this time I would forgive him a great many of his past errors were it only for the demonstration he has given in This that he is  capable  of so good and bountiful a manner of thinking  You may believe I made no scruple to open his letter after the receipt of your second on this subject Nor shall I of answering it as I have no reason to find fault with it An article in his favour procured him however so much the easier as I must own by way of amends for the undue displeasure I took against him tho' he knows it not  It is lucky enough that this matter was cleared up  to me by your friendly diligence so soon For had I wrote at all before that it would have been to reinforce my dismission of him and perhaps the very motive mentioned for it had affected me more than I think it ought And then what an advantage would that have given him when he could have clear'd up the matter so happily for himself  When I send you This letter of his you will see how very humble he is What acknowlegements of natural impatience What confession of faults as you prognosticated A very different appearance I must own all these make now the story of the pretty Rustic is clear'd up than they would have made had it notAnd methinks too my dear I can allow the girl to be prettier than before I could tho' I never saw herFor  Virtue  is Beauty in perfection  You will see how he accounts to me thro' indisposition  'that he could not come for my letter in person and he labours the point as if he thought I should be uneasy that he did not'  I am sorry he should be ill on my account and I will allow that the suspense he has been in for some time past must have been vexatious enough to so impatient a spirit But all is owing originally to himself  You will find him in the presumption of being forgiven  'full of contrivances and expedients for my escaping the compulsion threatened me'  I have always said that next to being without fault is the acknowlegement of a fault since no amendment can be expected where an error is defended But you will see in this very letter an haughtiness even in his submissions 'Tis true I know not where to find fault as to the expression yet cannot I be satisfy'd that his humility  is  humility or even an humility upon such conviction as one should be pleased with  To be sure he is far from being a polite man Yet is he not directly and characteristically  un  polite  But  his  is such a sort of politeness as has by a carelessness founded on a very early indulgence and perhaps on too much success in riper years and an arrogance built upon both grown into assuredness and of course as I may say into indelicacy  The distance you recommend at which to keep this sex is certainly right in the main Familiarity destroys reverence But with whomNot with those surely who are prudent grateful and generous  But it is very difficult for persons who would avoid running into one extreme to keep clear of another Hence Mr Lovelace perhaps thinks it the mark of a great spirit to humour his pride tho' at the expence of delicacy But can the man be a deep man who knows not how to make such distinctions as a person of moderate parts cannot miss  He complains heavily of my  'readiness to take mortal offence at him and to dismiss him for ever It is a  high  conduct he says he must be sincere enough to tell me and what must be very far from contributing to allay his apprehensions of the possibility that I may be persecuted into my relations measures in behalf of Mr Solmes'  You will see how he puts his present and his future happiness  'with regard to both worlds intirely upon me'  The ardour with which he vows and promises I think the heart only can dictate How else can any one guess at a man's heart  You'll also see  'that he has already heard of the interview I am to have with Mr Solmes'  and with what vehemence and anguish he expresses himself on the occasion I intend to take proper notice of the ignoble means he stoops to to come at his early intelligence out of our family If persons pretending to principle bear not their testimony against unprincipled actions who shall check them  You'll see how passionately he presses me to oblige  '  him with a few lines before the interview between Mr Solmes and me take place if it must take place to confirm his hope that I have no view in my displeasure to  him  to give encouragement to  Solmes  An apprehension he says that he must be excused for repeating especially as it is a favour granted to that man which I have refused to him since as he infers were it not with such an expectation why should my  friends  press it'  Saturday April  I HAVE written and to this effect  'That I had never intended to write another line to a man who could take upon himself to reflect upon my sex and myself for having thought fit to make use of my own judgment  'That I have submitted to this interview with Mr Solmes purely as an act of duty to shew my friends that I will comply with their commands as far as I can and that I hope when Mr Solmes himself shall see how determin'd I am he will no longer prosecute a sute in which it is impossible he should succeed with my consent  'That my aversion to him is too sincere to permit me to doubt myself on this occasion But nevertheless he Mr Lovelace must not imagine that my rejecting of Mr Solmes is in favour to him That I value my freedom and independency too much if my friends will but leave me to my own judgment to give them up to a man so uncontroulable and who shews me beforehand what I have to expect from him were I in his power  'I express my high disapprobation of the methods he takes to come at what passes in a private family That the pretence of corrupting other people's servants by way of reprisal for the spies they have set upon him is a very poor excuse a justification of one meanness by another  'That there is a  right  and a  wrong  in every thing let people put what glosses they please upon their actions To condemn a deviation and to follow it by as great a one what is This doing but propagating a general corruption A Stand must be made by somebody turn round the evil as many as may or virtue will be lost  And shall it not be I  a worthy mind will say that shall make this Stand  'I leave it to him to judge whether  his  be a worthy one try'd by this rule And whether knowing the impetuosity of his disposition and the improbability there is that my family will ever be reconciled to him I ought to encourage his hopes  'That these spots and blemishes give me not earnestness enough for any sake but  his own  to wish him in a juster and nobler train of thinking and acting for that I truly despise many of the ways he allows himself in Our minds are therefore infinitely different And as to his professions of reformation I must tell him that profuse acknowlegements without amendment are but to me as so many stop mouth concessions which he may find much easier to make than either to defend himself or amend his errors  'That I have been lately made acquainted And so I have by Betty and she by my brother with the foolish liberty he gives himself of declaiming against matrimony I severely reprehend him on this occasion And ask him with what view he can take so witless so despicable a liberty worthy only of the most abandon'd and yet presume to address  me  'I tell him That if I am obliged to go to my uncle Antony's it is not to be inferr'd that I must therefore  necessarily  be Mr Solmes's wife Since I may not be so sure perhaps that the same exceptions lie so sstrongly against my quitting a house to which I shall be forcibly carry'd as if I left my  father's house And at the worst I may be able to keep them in suspense till my cousin Morden comes who will have a right to put me in possession of my grandfather's estate if I insist upon it'  This I doubt is somewhat of an artifice being principally design'd to keep him out of mischief For I have but little hope if carry'd thither whether sensible or senseless if I am left to my brother's and sister's mercy but they will endeavour to force the solemn obligation upon me Otherwise were there but any prospect of avoiding this by delaying or even by taking things to make me ill if nothing else would do till my cousin comes I hope I should not think of leaving even my uncle's house For I should not know how to square it to my own principles to dispense with the duty I owe to my father whereever it shall be his will to place me  But while you give me the charming hope that in order to avoid one man I shall not be under the necessity of throwing myself upon the friends of the other I think my case not absolutely desperate  I see not any of my family nor hear from them in any way of kindness This looks as if they themselves expected no great matters from that Tuesday's conference which makes my heart flutter everytime I think of it  My uncle Antony's intended presence I do not much like But That is preferable to my brother's or sister's My uncle is very impetuous in his anger I can't think Mr Lovelace can be much more so at least he cannot  look it  as my uncle with his harder features can These seaprosper'd gentlemen as my uncle has often made me think net used to any but elemental controul and even ready to buffet That bluster often as violently as the winds they are accustomed to be angry at  I believe both Mr Solmes and I shall look like a couple of fools if it be true as my uncle Harlowe  writes and Betty often tells me that he is as much afraid of seeing me as I am of seeing him  Adieu my happy thrice happy Miss Howe who have no hard terms affixed to your dutyWho have nothing to do but to fall in with a choice your mamma has made for you to which you have not nor can have a just objection Except the frowardness of sex as our free censurers would perhaps take the liberty to say makes it one that the choice was your mamma's at first hand Perverse nature we know loves not to be prescribed to altho' youth is not so well qualify'd either by sedateness or experience to choose for itself  To  know  your own happiness and that it is  now  nor to leave it to  after  reflection to look back upon the  preferable past  with a heavy and selfaccusing heart that you did not choose it when you might have chosen it is all that is necessary to complete your felicityAnd this power is wish'd you by  Your CL HARLOWE  LETTER XXVII Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Sunday April  I Ought yesterday to have acknowleged the receipt of your parcel Robin tells me that the Joseph Leman whom you mention as the traitor saw him He was in the poultryyard and spoke to Robin over the bank which divides that from the GreenLane What brings you hither Mr RobertBut I can tell Hie away as fast as you can  No doubt but their dependence upon this fellow's vigilance and upon Betty's leaves you more at liberty in your airings than you would otherwise be But you are the only person I ever heard of who in such circumstances had not some faithful servant to  trust little offices to A poet my dear would not have gone to work for an Angelica without giving her her Violetta her Cleanthe her Clelia or some such prettynam'd confidanteAn old nurse at the least  I read to my mamma several passages of your letters But your last paragraph in your yesterday's charm'd her quite You have won her heart by it she told me And while her fit of gratitude for it lasted I was thinking to open my proposal and to press it with all the earnestness I could give it when Hickman came in making his legs and stroking his cravat and ruffles in turn  I could most freely have ruffled him for itAs it wasSirsaw you not some one of the servantsCould not one of them have come in before you  He begg'd pardon Looked as if he knew not whether he had best keep his ground or withdrawTill my mamma Why Nancy we are not upon particularsPray Mr Hickman sit down  By your leave good madam to meYou know his drawl when his muscles give him the respectful hesitation  Ay ay pray sit down honest man if you are wearyBut by my  mamma  if you please I desire my hoop may have its full circumference All they're good for that I know is to clean dirty shoes and to keep illmanner'd fellows at a distance  Strange girl cry'd my mamma displeased but with a milder turn Ay ay Mr Hickman sit down by  me  I have no such  forbidding folly  in my dressI looked serious and in my heart was glad this speech of hers was not made to your uncle Antony  My mamma with the true widow's freedom would mighty prudently have led into our subject and have had him see I question not that very paragraph in your letter which is so much in his favour He was highly  obliged to dear Miss Harlowe she would assure him that she  did  say  But I asked him If he had any news by his last letters from London A question he always understands to be a  subjectchanger  for otherwise I never put it And so if he be  but  silent I am not angry with him that he answers it not  I choose not to mention my proposal before him till I know how it will be relish'd by my mamma If it be not well received perhaps I may employ  him  on the occasion Yet I don't like to owe him an obligation if I could help it For men who have his views in their heads do so parade it so sstrut about if a woman condescend to employ them in her affairs that one has no patience with them But if I  find  not an opportunity this day I will  make  one tomorrow  I shall not open either of your sealedup parcels but in  your  presence There is no need Your conduct is out of all question with me And by the extracts you have given me from his letters and your own I know all that relates to the present situation of things between you  I was going to give you a little flippant hint or two But since you wish to be thought superior to all our sex in the command of yourself and since indeed you deserve to be so thought I will spare youYou are however at times more than half inclin'd to speak out That you do not is only owing to a little bashful struggle between  you  and  yourself  as I may say When that is quite got over I know you will favour me undisguisedly with the result  I cannot forgive your taking upon you at so extravagant a rate too to pay my mamma's servant Indeed I  am  and I  will be  angry with you for it A year's wages at once well nigh only as unknown to my mamma I make it better for the servants according  to their meritsHow it made the man stareAnd it may be his ruin too as far as I know If he should buy a ring and marry a sorry body in the neighbourhood with the money one would be loth a twelvemonth hence that the poor old fellow should think he had reason to wish the bounty never conferr'd  I  MUST  give you your way in these things  you sayAnd I know there is no contradicting you For you were ever putting too great a value upon little offices done for  you  and too little upon the great ones you do for  others  The satisfaction you have in doing so I grant it repays you But why should you by the nobleness of your mind throw reproaches upon the rest of the worldParticularly upon your own family and upon ours too  If as I have heard you say it is a good rule to  give  WORDS  the hearing but to form our judgments of men and things by  DEEDS ONLY what shall we think of one who seeks to find palliatives in  words  for narrowness of heart in the very persons her  deeds  so silently yet so forcibly reflect upon Why blush you not my dear friend to be thus singularWhen you meet with another person whose mind is like your own then display your excellencies as you please But till then for pity's sake let your heart and your spirit suffer a little contraction  I intended to write but a few lines chiefly to let you know your parcels are come safe And accordingly I began in a large hand and I am already come to the end of my second sheet But I could write a quire without hesitation upon a subject so copious and so beloved as is your praiseNot for  this  single instance of your generosity since I am really angry with you for it but for the benevolence exemplified in the whole tenor of your life and actions of which This is but a common instance God direct you in your own arduous trials is all  I have room to add and make you as happy as you think to be  Your own ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXVIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sunday Night April  I Have many new particulars to acquaint you with that shew a great change in my friends behaviour to me I did not think we had so much art among us as I find we have I will give them to you as they offer'd  All the family was at church in the morning They brought good Dr Lewin with them in pursuance of a previous invitation And the doctor sent up to desire my permission to attend me in my own apartment  You may believe it was easily granted  So the doctor came up  We had a conversation of near an hour before dinner But to my surprize he waved every thing that would have led to the subject I supposed he wanted to talk about At last I asked him If it were not thought strange I should be so long absent from church He made me some handsome compliments upon it But said For his part he had ever made it a rule to avoid interfering in the private concerns of families unless desired to do so  I was prodigiously disappointed But supposing that he was thought too just a man to be made a judge of in this cause I led no more to it Nor when he was called to dinner did he take the least notice of leaving me behind him there  But this was the first time since my confinement that I thought it a hardship not to dine below And when I parted with him on the stairs a tear would burst  its way and he hurried down his own goodnatured eyes glistening for he saw itNor trusted he his voice lest the accent I suppose should have discover'd his concern departing in silence tho' with his usual graceful obligingness  I hear that he praised me and my part in the conversation we had held togetherTo shew them I suppose that it was not upon the interesting subjects which I make no doubt he was desired not to enter upon  He left me so dissatisfy'd yet so perplexed with this new way of treatment that I never found myself so puzzled and so much out of my train  But I was to be more so This was to be a day of puzzle to me  Pregnant  puzzle if I may so sayFor there must great meaning lie behind it  In the afternoon all but my brother and sister went to church with the good doctor who left his compliments for me I took a walk in the garden My brother and sister walked in it too and kept me in their eye a good while on purpose as I thought that I might see how gay and goodhumour'd they were together At last they came down the walk that I was coming up handinhand loverlike  Your servant MissYour servant Sirpassed between my brother and me  Is it not coldish sister Clary in a kinder voice than usual said my sister and stopp'dI stopp'd and courtesy'd low to her halfcourtesyI think not sister said I  She went on I courtesy'd without return and proceeded turning to my poultryyard  By a shorter turn arminarm they were there before me  I think Clary said my brother you must present me with some of this breed for Scotland  If you please brother  I'll choose for you said my sister  And while I fed them they picked out half a dozen Yet intending nothing by it I believe but to shew a deal of love and goodhumour to each other before me  My uncles next after church was done to speak in the common phrase were to do me the honour of  their  notice They bid Betty tell me they would drink tea with me in my own apartment Now thought I shall I have the subject of next Tuesday inforced upon me  But they contradicted the teaorders and only my uncle Harlowe came up to me  Halfdistant halfaffectionate was the air he put on to his  daughterniece  as he used to call me and I threw myself at his feet and besought his favour  None of these discomposures child None of these apprehensions You'll now have everybody's favour All is coming about my dearI was impatient to see youI could no longer deny myself this satisfaction And raised me and kissed me and called me Charming creature  But he waved entering into any interesting subject All will be well now All will be rightNo more complainings Everybody loves youI only came to make my earliest court to you were his condescending words and to sit and talk of twenty and twenty fond things as I used to doAnd let every past disagreeable thing be forgotten as if nothing had happen'd  He understood me as beginning to hint at the disgrace of my confinementNo disgrace my dear can fall to your lot Your reputation is too well establishedI long'd to see you repeated heI have seen nobody half so amiable since I saw you last  And again he kissed my cheek my glowing cheek for I was impatient I was vexed to be thus as I thought play'd upon And how could I be grateful for a visit that it now was evident was only a too  humble  artifice to draw me in against the next Tuesday or to leave me inexcusable to them all  O my cunning brotherThis is his contrivance And then my anger made me recollect the triumph in his and my sister's loves to each other acted before me and the mingled indignation flashing from their eyes as arm in arm they spoke to me and the forced condescension playing upon their lips when they called me Clary and Sister  Do you think I could with these reflections look upon my uncle Harlowe's visit as the favour he seem'd desirous I should think it to beIndeed I could not and seeing him so studiously avoid all recrimination as I may call it I gave into the affectation and followed him in his talk of indifferent thingsWhile he seemed to admire This thing and That as if he had never seen them before and now and then condescendingly kissed the hand that wrought some of the things he fixed his eyes upon not so much to admire them as to find subjects to divert what was most in his head and in my own heart  At his going awayHow can I leave you here by yourself my dearYou whose company used to enliven us allYou are not expected down indeed But I protest I had a good mind to surprise your papa and mammaIf I thought nothing would arise that would be disagreeableMy dear my love O the dear artful gentleman how could my uncle Harlowe so dissemble What say youWill you give me your handWill you see your fatherCan you stand his first displeasure on seeing the dear creature who has given him and all of us so much disturbanceCan you promise future  He saw me rising in my temperNay my dear if you cannot be all resignation I would not have you think of it  My heart struggling between duty and warmth of temper was full You know my dear I never could  bear to be dealt meanly withHowhow  can  you SirYou my papauncleHow  can  you SirThe poor girlFor I could not speak with connexion  Nay my dear if you cannot be all duty all resignationbetter stay where you areBut after the instance you have given  Instance I have given  What instance Sir  Well well child better stay where you are if your past confinement hangs so heavy upon youBut now there will be a sudden end to itAdieu my dearThree words onlyLet your compliance be sincereAnd love me as you used to love meYour grandfather did not do so much for you as I will do for you  Without suffering me to reply he hurry'd away I thought as if he had an escape and was glad his part was over  Don't you see my dear how they are all determin'dHave I not reason to dread next Tuesday  Up presently after came my sisterTo observe I suppose the way I was inShe found me in tears  Have you not a Thomas à Kempis sister with a stiff air  I have Madam  Madam  How long are we to be at this distance Clary  No  longer if you allow me to call you sister my dear Bella And I took her hand  No fawning neither girl  I withdrew my hand as hastily as I should do if reaching at a parcel from under the wood I had been bit by a scorpion  I beg pardonToo too ready to make advances I am always subjecting myself to contempts  People who know not how to keep a middle behaviour said she must evermore do so  I will fetch you the KempisI didHere it isYou will find excellent things Bella in that little book  I wish retorted she you had profited by them  I wish  you  may said I Example from a sister older than one's self is a fine thing  Older Saucy little foolAnd away she flung  What a captious old woman will my sister make if she lives to be oneDemanding the reverence yet not aiming at the merit and asham'd of the years that only can intitle her to the reverence  It is plain from what I have  related  that they think they have got me at some advantage by obtaining my consent to this interview But if it were  not  Betty's impertinence just now would make it more evident She has been complimenting me upon it and upon the visit of my uncle Harlowe She says the difficulty now is more than half over with me She is sure I would not see Mr Solmes but to have him Now shall she be soon better imploy'd than of late she has been All hands will be at work She loves dearly to have weddings go forwardWho knows whose turn will be next  I found in the afternoon a reply to my answer to Mr Lovelace's letter It is full of promises full of gratitude of  eternal  gratitude is his word among others still more hyperbolic Yet Mr Lovelace the  least  of any man whose letters I have seen runs into those elevated absurdities I should be apt to despise him for it if he did Such language looks always to me as if the flatterer thought to  find  a woman a fool or hop'd to  make  her one  'He regrets my indifference to him which puts all the hope he has in my savour upon my friends shocking usage of me  'As to my charge upon him of unpoliteness and uncontroulablenessWhat he asks can he say since being unable absolutely to vindicate himself  he has too much ingenuity to attempt to do so Yet is struck dumb by my harsh construction that his acknowleging temper is owing more to his carelesness to defend himself than to his inclination to amend He had never  before  met with the objections against his morals which I had raised  justly  raised And he was resolved to obviate them What is it he asks that he had promised but reformation by my example And what occasion for the promise if he had not faults and those very great ones to reform of He hopes acknowlegement of an error is no bad sign altho' my severe virtue has interpreted it into one  'He believes I may be right  severely  right he calls it in my judgment against making reprisals in the case of the intelligence he receives from my family He cannot charge himself to be of a temper that leads him to be inquisitive into anybody's private affairs but hopes that the circumstances of the case and the strange conduct of my friends will excuse him especially when so much depends upon his knowing the movements of a family so violently bent by measures right or wrong to carry their point against me in malice to him People he says who act like Angels ought to have Angels to deal with For his part he has not yet learn'd the difficult lesson of returning  good for evil  And shall think himself the less encourag'd to learn it by the treatment I have met with from the very spirits which were he to lay himself under their feet would trample upon him as they do upon me  'He excuses himself for the liberties he owns he has heretofore taken in ridiculing the marriagestate It is a subject he says that he has not of late treated so lightly He owns it to be so trite so beaten a topic with all libertines and witlings so frothy so empty so nothingmeaning so wornout a  theme  that he is heartily ashamed of himself ever to have  made it  his  He condemns it as a stupid reflection upon the laws and good order of society and upon a man's own ancestors And in himself who has some reason to value himself upon his descent and alliances more censurable than in those who have not the same advantage to boast of He promises to be more circumspect than ever both in his words and actions that he may be more and more worthy of my approbation and that he may give an assurance beforehand that a foundation is laid

hands I will make it my endeavour to deserve your good opinion that I may not at once disgrace your judgment and my own heart  I have another letter from Mr Lovelace He is extremely apprehensive of the meeting I am to have with Mr Solmes tomorrow He says  'That the airs that wretch gives himself on the occasion add to his concern and it is with infinite difficulty that he prevails upon himself not to make him a visit to let him know what he may expect if compulsion be used towards me in his favour He assures me That Solmes has actually talked with tradesmen of new equipages and names the people in town with whom he has treated That he has even Was there ever such a horrid wretch allotted This and That apartment in his house for a nursery and other offices'  How shall I bear to hear such a creature talk of love to me I shall be out of all patience with himBesides I thought that he did not dare to make or talk of these impudent preparationsSo inconsistent as such are with my brother's viewsBut I fly the shocking subject  Upon this confidence of Solmes you will less wonder at That of Lovelace  'in pressing me in the name of all his family to escape from so determined a violence as is intended to be offer'd to me at my uncle's That the forward contriver should propose his uncle's chariotandsix to be at the stile that leads up to the lonely coppice adjoining to our paddock You will see how audaciously he mentions  settlements ready drawn horsemen ready to mount and one of his cousins Montague to be in the chariot or at the George in the neighbouring village waiting to accompany me to Lord M's or to either of his aunts or to town as I please and upon such orders or conditions and under such restrictions as to himself as I shall prescribe'  You will see how he threatens  'To watch and waylay them and rescue me as he calls it by an armed force of friends and servants if they attempt to carry me against my will to my uncle's and this whether I give my consent to the enterprise or notSince he shall have no hopes if I am once there'  O my dear friend Who can think of these things and not be extremely miserable in her apprehensions  This mischievous sex What had I to do with any of them or they with meI had deserv'd This were it by my own seeking by my own giddiness that I had brought myself into this situationI wish with all my heartBut how foolishly we are apt to wish when we find ourselves unhappy and know not how to help ourselves  On your mamma's goodness however is my reliance If I can but avoid being precipitated on either hand till my cousin Morden arrives a reconciliation must follow and all will be happy  I have deposited a letter for Mr Lovelace in which  'I charge him to avoid any rash step any visit to Mr Solmes which may be followed by acts of violence as he would not disoblige me for ever  I reassure him  'That I will sooner die than be 'that man's wife  'Whatever be my usage whatever the result of this interview I insist upon his not presuming to offer violence to any of my friends And express myself highly displeased that he should presume upon such an interest in my favour as to think himself intitled to dispute my father's authority in my  removal to my uncle's altho' I tell him that I will omit neither prayers nor contrivance even to the making of myself ill to avoid going'  Tomorrow is TuesdayHow soon comes upon us the day we dreadO that a deep sleep of twentyfour hours would seize my facultiesBut then the next day would be Tuesday as to all the effects and purposes for which I so much dread it If this reach you before the event of this so much apprehended interview can be known pray for  Your CL HARLOWE  LETTER XXX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Tuesday Morning Six o'Clock  THE day is comeI wish it were happily over I have had a wretched night Hardly a wink have I slept ruminating upon the approaching interview The very distance of time they consented to has added solemnity to the meeting which otherwise it would not have had  A thoughtful mind is not a blessing to be coveted unless it had such a happy vivacity with it as yours A vivacity which enables a person to enjoy the  present  without being overanxious about the  future    Tuesday Eleven o'Clock  I HAVE had a visit from my aunt Hervey Betty in her alarming way told me I should have a Lady to breakfast with me whom I little expected giving me to believe it was my mamma This flutter'd me so much on hearing a Lady coming upstairs supposing it was she not knowing how to account for her motives in such a visit after I had been so long banish'd from her presence that my aunt at her entrance  took notice of my disorder and after the first salutation  Why Miss said she you seem surpriz'dUpon my word you thoughtful young Ladies have strange apprehensions about nothing at all What taking my hand can be the matter with youWhy my dear tremble tremble tremble at this rate You'll be fit to be seen by nobody Come my love kissing my cheek pluck up a courage By this needless flutter on the approaching interview when it is over you will judge of your other antipathies and laugh at yourself for giving way to so apprehensive an imagination  I said that whatever we strongly imagin'd was in its effects at the time  more  than imaginary altho' to others it might not appear so That I had not rested one hour all night That the impertinent set over me had flutter'd me with giving me room to think that it was my mamma who was coming up to me And that at this rate I should be very little qualify'd to see anybody I disliked to see  There was no accounting for these things she said Mr Solmes last night suppos'd he should be under as much agitation as I  Who is it then Madam that so reluctant an interview on both sides is to please  Both of you my dear I hope after the first flurries are over The most apprehensive beginnings I have often known make the happiest conclusions  There can be but one happy conclusion to the intended visit and that is That both sides may be satisfy'd it will be the last  She then represented how unhappy it would be for me if I did not suffer myself to be prevailed upon She pressed me to receive him as became my education And declar'd that his apprehensions at seeing me were owing to his love and his awe intim  ting that true love was best known by fear and  reverence and that no blustering braving lover could deserve encouragement  To this I answered That constitution was a great deal to be considered That a man of spirit would act like one and could do nothing meanly That a creeping mind would creep in everything where it had a view to obtain a benefit by it and insult where it had power and nothing to expectThat this was not a point now to be determin'd with me That I had said as much as I could possibly say on this subject That this interview was imposed upon me By those indeed who had a right to impose it but that it was sorely against my will comply'd with and for this reason That there was  aversion  not  wilfulness  in the case and so nothing could come of it but a pretence as I much apprehended to use me still more severely than I had been used  She was then pleased to charge me with prepossession and prejudice Expatiated upon the duty of a child Imputed to me abundance of fine qualities but told me that in this case  that  of persuadableness was wanting to crown All She insisted upon the  merit  of obedience altho' my will were  not  in it From a little hint I gave of my still greater dislike to see Mr Solmes on account of the freedom I had treated him with she talked to me of his forgiving disposition of his infinite respect for me and Icannottellwhat of this sort  I never found myself so fretful in my life I told my aunt so and begg'd her pardon for it But she said it was well disguised then for she saw nothing but little tremors usual with young Ladies when they were to see their admirers for the  first  time as this might be called For that it was the first time I had consented to see him in that lightBut that the  next    How Madam interrupted IIs it then imagined I give this meeting upon that foot  To be sure it is child  To be sure it is  MadamThen do I yet desire to decline itI will not I cannot see him if he expects me to see him upon those terms  Niceness punctilioMere punctilio nieceCan you think that your appointment Day Place Hour and knowing what the intent of it was is to be interpreted away as a mere ceremony and to mean nothingLet me tell you my dear your father mother uncles everybody respect this appointment as the first act of your compliance with their wills and therefore recede not I desire you but make a merit of what cannot be help'd  O the hideous wretchPardon me Madam  I  to be suppos'd to meet such a man as  that  with such a view and  he  to be arm'd with such an expectationBut it cannot be that  he  expects it whatever others may doIt is plain he cannot by the fear he tells you all he shall have to see me If his  hope  were so audacious he could not  fear  so much  Indeed he  has  this hope and justly founded too But his fear arises from his reverence as I told you before  His reverence  his unworthiness'Tis so apparent that he himself sees it as well as everybody else Hence the purchase he aims atHence is it that settlements are to make up for acknowleg'd want of merit  His  unworthiness  say youNot so fast my dear Does not this look like setting a high value upon yourselfWe all have exalted notions of your merit niece but nevertheless it would not be wrong if you were to arrogate less to  yourself  tho' more were to be your due than your friends attribute to you  I am sorry Madam it should be thought arrogance in me to suppose I am not worthy of a better man than Mr Solmes both as to person and mind  And as to fortune I thank God I despise all that can be insisted upon in his favour from so poor a plea  She told me It signify'd nothing to talk I knew the expectation of everyone  Indeed I did notIt was impossible I could think of such a strange expectation upon a compliance made only to shew I would comply in all that was in my power to comply with  I might easily me said have supposed that everyone thought I was beginning to oblige them all by the kind behaviour of my brother and sister to me in the garden last Sunday by my sister's visit to me afterwards in my chamber altho' both more stiffly received by me than were either wished or expected by my uncle Harlowe's affectionate visit to me the same afternoon not indeed so very gratefully received as I used to receive his favoursBut this he kindly imputed to the displeasure I had conceived at my confinement and to my comingoff by degrees that I might keep myself in countenance for my past opposition  See my dear the low cunning of that Sundaymanagement which then so much surprised me And see the reason why Dr Lewin was admitted to visit me yet forbore to enter upon a subject that I thought he came to talk to me aboutFor it seems there was no occasion to dispute with me on a point I was to be  supposed  to have conceded toSee also how unfairly my brother and sister must have represented their pretended kindness when tho' they had an end to answer by  appearing  kind their antipathy to me seems to have been so strong that they could not help insulting me by their arminarm loverlike behaviour to each other as my sister afterwards likewise did when she came to borrow my Kempis  I lifted up my hands and eyesI cannot said I give this treatment a nameThe  end  so unlikely to be answer'd by  means  so lowI know  whose  the whole  isHe that could get my uncle Harlowe to contribute his part and procure the acquiescence of the rest of my friends to it must have the power to do any thing with them against me  Again my aunt told me that talking and invective now I had given the expectation would signify nothing She hoped I would not shew them all that they had been too forward in their constructions of my desire to oblige them She could assure me that it would be worse for me if  now  I receded than if I had never advanced  Advanced  Madam How can you say  advanced  Why this is a trick upon meA poor low trick Pardon me Madam I don't say you have a hand in itBut my dearest aunt tell me Will not my mamma be present at this dreaded interviewWill she not so far favour meWere it but to qualify  Qualify  my dear interrupted sheYour mamma and your uncle Harlowe would not be present on this occasion for the world  O then Madam how can they look upon my consent to this interview as an  advance  My aunt was displeased at this home push Miss Clary said she there is no dealing with you It would be happy for you and for everybody else were your obedience as ready as your wit I will leave you  Not in anger I hope Madam interrupted IAll I meant was to observe that let the meeting issue as it  must  issue it cannot be a disappointment to  anybody    O Miss you seem to be a very determin'd young creatureMr Solmes will be here at your time▪ And remember once more that upon the coming afternoon depends the peace of your whole family▪ and your own happiness  And so saying down she hurried  Here I stop In what way I shall resume or when is not left to me to conjecture much less to determine I am excessively uneasyNo good news from your mamma I doubtI will deposite thus far for fear of the worst  Adieu my best my  only  friend  LETTER XXXI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Tuesday Evening and continued thro' the night  WELL my dear I am alive and here But how long I shall be either here or alive I cannot sayI have a vast deal to write and perhaps shall have little time for it Nevertheless I must tell you how the saucy Betty again fluttered me when she came up with this Solmes's message altho' as you will remember from my last I was in a way before that wanted no additional surprizes  Miss Miss Miss cry'd she as fast as she could speak with her arms spread abroad and all her fingers distended and held up will you be pleased to walk down into your own parlourThere is everybody I'll assure you in full  congregation  And there is Mr Solmes as fine as a Lord with a charming white peruke fine laced shirt and ruffles coat trimmed with silver and a waistcoat standing an end with laceQuite handsome believe meYou never saw such an alterationAh Miss shaking her head 'tis pity you have said so much against himBut you know how to come off for all thatI hope it will not be too late  Impertinence said IWert thou bid to come up in this fluttering wayAnd I took up my fan and fann'd myself  Bless me said she how soon these fine young Ladies will be put into  flusterations  I meant not either to offend or frighten you I am sure  Everybody there do you sayWho do you call everybody  Why Miss holding out her left palm opened and with a flourish and a saucy leer patting it with the forefinger of the other at every mentioned person There is your papaThere is your mammaThere is your uncle HarloweThere is your uncle AntonyYour aunt Hervey  My  young LadyAnd my young masterAnd Mr Solmes with the air of a great courtier standing up because he named youMrs Betty said he Then the ape of a wench bowed and scraped as awkwardly as I suppose the person she endeavoured to imitate Pray give my humble service to Miss and tell her I wait her commands  Was not this a wicked wenchI trembled so I could hardly stand I was spiteful enough to say that her young mistress I supposed bid her put on these airs to frighten me out of a capacity of behaving so calmly as should procure me my uncle's compassion  What a way do you put yourself in Miss said the insolentCome dear Madam taking up my fan which I had laid down and approaching me with it fanning shall I  None of thy impertinenceBut say you  all  my friends are below with him And am I to  appear  before them  all  I can't tell if they'll stay when you come I think they seemed to be moving when Mr Solmes gave me his ordersBut what answer shall I carry to the 'Squire  Say I can't goBut yet when 'tis over 'tis over Say I'll wait uponI'll attendI'll come presentlySay any thing I care not whatBut give me my fan and fetch me a glass of water  She went and I fanned myself all the time for I was in a flame and hemm'd and struggled with myself  all I could and when she returned drank my water and finding no hope presently of a quieter heart I sent her down and followed her with precipitation trembling so that had I not hurried I question if I could have gone down at all O my dear what a poor passive machine is the body when the mind is disorder'd  There are two doors to  my  parlour as I used to call it As I entered at one my friends hurried out at the other I saw just the gown of my sister the last who slid away My uncle Antony went out with them but he staid not long as you shall hear And they all remained in the next parlour a wainscotpartition only parting the two I remember them both in one But they were separated in favour of us girls for each to receive her visitors in at her pleasure  Mr Solmes approached me as soon as I entered cringing to the ground a visible confusion in every feature of his face After half a dozen choak'dup MadamsHe was very sorryhe was very much concernedIt was his misfortuneAnd there he stopp'd being unable presently to complete a sentence  This gave me a little more presence of mind Cowardice in a foe begets courage in one'sselfI see that plainly nowYet perhaps at bottom the newmade bravo is a greater coward than the other  I turned from him and seated myself in one of the fireside chairs fanning myself I have since recollected that I must have looked very saucily Could I have had any  thoughts  of the man I should have despised myself for it But what can be said in the case of an aversion so perfectly sincere  He hemmed five or six times as I had done above and these produced a sentenceThat I could not but see his confusion This sentence produced two or three more I believe my aunt was his tutoress For it was his awe his reverence for so superlative a  LadyI assure youAnd he hopedhe hopedThree times he hoped before he told me whatthat I was too generous Generosity he said was my character to despise him for suchfor such  true  tokens of his love  I do indeed see you under some confusion Sir and this gives me hope that altho' I have been compelled as I may call it to this interview it may be attended with happier effects than I had apprehended from it  He had hemmed himself into more courage  You could not Madam imagine any creature so blind to your merits and so little attracted by them as easily to forego the interest and approbation he was honoured with by your worthy family while he had any hope given him that one day he might by his perseverance and zeal expect your favour  I am but too much aware Sir that it is upon the interest and approbation you mention that you build such hope It is impossible otherwise that a man who has any regard for his  own  happiness would persevere against such declarations as I have made and think myself obliged to make in justice to you as well as to myself  He had seen many instances he told me and had heard of more where Ladies had seemed as averse and yet had been induced some by motives of compassion others by persuasion of friends to change their minds and had been very happy afterwards And he hoped this might be the case here  I have no notion Sir of compliment in an article of such importance as this Yet am I sorry to be obliged to speak my mind so plainly as I am going to doKnow then that I have invincible objections Sir to your address I have declared them with an earnestness that I believe is without example And whyBecause I believe it is without example that any young creature circumstanced as I am was ever treated as I have been treated on your account  It is hoped Madam that your consent may in time be obtained  That  is the hope and I shall be a miserable man if it cannot  Better Sir give me leave to say you were miserable by yourself than that you should make two so  You may have heard Madam things to my disadvantageNo man is without enemiesBe pleased to let me know  what  you have heard and I will either own my faults and amend or I will convince you that I am basely  bespattered  And once I understand you overheard something that I should say that gave you offenceUnguardedly perhaps but nothing but what shewed my value and that I would persist so long as I could have hope  I have indeed heard many things to your disadvantageAnd I was far from being pleased with what I overheard fall from your lips But as you were not any thing to me and never could be it was not for me to be concerned about the one or the other  I am sorry Madam to hear this I am sure you should not tell me of any fault that I would be unwilling to correct in myself  Then Sir correct this faultDo not wish to have a poor young creature compelled in the most material article of her life for the sake of motives she despises and in behalf of a person she cannot value One that has in her own right sufficient to set her above all offers and a spirit that craves no more than what it  has  to make itself easy and happy  I don't see Madam how you would be happy if I were to discontinue my address For  That is nothing to you Sir interrupted I Do you but withdraw your pretensions And if it be thought fit to start up another man for my punishment the blame will not lie at your door You will be intitled to my thanks and most heartily will I thank you  He paused and seemed a little at a loss And I  was going to give him still stronger and more personal instances of my plaindealing when in came my uncle Antony  So niece sositting in state like a Queen giveing audience  haughty  audienceMr Solmes why stand you thus humblyWhy this distance man I hope to see you upon a more intimate footing before we part  I arose as soon as he enteredand approached him with a bent knee Let me Sir reverence my uncle whom I have not for so long a time seenLet me Sir bespeak your favour and compassion  You'll have the favour of everybody niece when you know how to deserve it  If ever I deserved it I deserve it nowI have been hardly usedI have made proposals that ought to have been accepted and such as would not have been  asked  of me What have I done that I must be banished and confined thus disgracefully That I must be allowed to have no freewill in an article that concerns my present and future happiness  Miss Clary replied my uncle you have had your will in everything till now and this makes your parents will sit so heavy upon you  My will Sir Be pleased to allow me to ask What was my will till now but my father's will and yours and my uncle Harlowe's willHas it not been my pride to obey and obligeI never asked a favour that I did not first sit down and consider if it were fit to be granted And now to shew my obedience have I not offered to live single Have I not offered to divest myself of my grandfather's bounty and to cast myself upon my papa's to be withdrawn whenever I disoblige him Why dear good Sir am I to be made unhappy in a point so concerning to my happiness  Your grandfather's estate is not wished from you You are not desired to live a single life You know  our  motives and we guess at  yours  And let me tell you well as we love you we would much sooner choose to follow you to the grave than that  yours  should take place  I will engage never to marry any man without my father's consent and your's Sir and everybody's Did I ever give you cause to doubt my wordAnd here I will take the solemnest oath that can be offered me  That is the matrimonial one interrupted he with a big voiceand to this gentlemanIt shall it shall cousin ClaryAnd the more you oppose it the worse it shall be for you  This and before the man who seem'd to assume courage upon it highly provoked me  Then Sir you shall sooner follow me to the grave  indeed  I will undergo the cruelest death I will even consent to enter into the awful vault of my ancestors and to have that bricked up upon me than consent to be miserable for lifeAnd Mr Solmes turning to him take notice of what I say  This  or  any  death I will sooner undergo That will soon be over than be yours and for  ever  unhappy  My uncle was in a terrible rage upon this He took Mr Solmes by the hand shocked as the man seemed to be and drew him to the windowDon't be surprised Mr Solmes don't be concerned at  this  We know and rapp'd out a sad oath what women will say The wind is not more boistrous nor more changeable And again he swore to That If you think it worth your while to wait for such an ungrateful girl as This I'll engage she'll  veer about  I'll engage she  shall  And a third time violently swore to it  Then coming up to me who had thrown myself very much disordered by my vehemence into the contrary window as if he would have beat me his face violently working his hands clenched and his  teeth setYes yes yes hissed the poor gentleman you shall you shall you shall cousin Clary be Mr solmes's we will see that you shall and this in one week at farthestAnd then a fourth time he confirmed it Poor gentleman how he sworeStrange that people who have suffered in their time so much by storms should be so stormy  I am sorry Sir said I to see you in such a passion All This I am but too sensible is owing to my brother's instigation who would not himself give the instance of duty that is exacted from me It is best for me to withdraw I shall but provoke you farther I fear For though I would gladly obey you if I could yet This is a point determined with me and I cannot so much as  wish  to get it over  How could one help these strong declarations the man in presence  I was going out at the door I came in at the gentlemen looking upon one another as if referring to each other what to do or whether to engage my stay or suffer me to go And who should I meet at the door but my brother who had heard all that had passed  Judge my surprize when he bolted upon me so unexpectedly and taking my hand which he grasped with violence Return pretty Miss said he return if you pleaseYou shall not yet  be bricked up  Your  instigating  brother shall save you from ThatO thou fallen angel said he peering up to my downcast facesuch a sweetness  here  and such an obstinacy  there  tapping my neckO thou true womantho' so youngBut you shall not have your Rake Remember that in a loud whisper as if he would be decently indecent before the manYou shall be redeemed and this worthy gentleman raising his voice will be so good as to redeem you from rainand hereafter you will bless him or have reason to bless him for his  condescension  that was the brutal brother's word  He had led me up to meet Mr Solmes whose hand he took as he himself held mine Here Sir said he take the rebel daughter's hand I give it you now She shall confirm the gift in a week's time or will have neither father mother nor uncles to boast of  I snatched my hand away  How now Miss  And how now SirWhat right have YOU to dispose of my handIf you govern everybody else you shall not govern  me  especially in a point so immediately relative to myself and in which you neither have nor ever shall have any thing to do  I would have broke from him but he held my hand too fast  Let me go SirWhy am I thus treatedYou  design  I doubt not with your unmanly gripings to hurt me as you do But again I say Wherefore is it that I am to be thus treated by YOU  He tossed my hand from him with a whirl that pained my very shoulder I wept and held my other hand to the part  Mr Solmes blamed him so did my uncle  He had no patience he said with such a perverseness and to think of my reflections upon himself before he entered He had only given me back the hand I had not deserved he should touch It was ene of my arts to pretend to be pained  Mr Solmes said He would sooner give up all his hopes of me than that I should be used unkindly And he offered to plead in my behalf to them both and applied himself with a bow as if for my approbation of his interposition  But I said I am obliged to your intention Mr Solmes to interpose to save me from my brother's violence But I cannot wish to owe so poor an obligation to a man whose ungenerous perseverance is the occasion or at least the pretence of  that  violence and of all my disgraceful sufferings  How generous in you Mr Solmes said my brother to him to interpose in behalf of such an immoveable spirit But I beg of you to persistFor all our family's sake and for  her  sake too if you love her persistLet us save her if possible from ruining herself Look at her person Think of her fine qualitiesAll the world confesses them and we all gloried in her till now She is worth savingAnd after two or three more struggles she will be yours and take my word for it will reward your patienceTalk not therefore of giving up your hopes for a little whining folly She has entered upon a parade which she knows not how to quit with a  female  grace You have only her pride and her obstinacy to encounter And depend upon it you will be as happy a man in a fortnight as a marry'd man  can  be  You have heard me say my dear that my brother has always taken a liberty to reflect upon our Sex and upon MatrimonyHe would not if he did not think it  wit  Just as poor Mr Wyerley and others we both know prophane and ridicule Scripture and all to evidence their pretensions to the same pernicious talent and to have it thought that they are too wise to be good  Mr Solmes with a selfsatisfied air presumptuously said He would suffer every thing to  oblige  my family and to  save  me And doubted not to be amply rewarded could he be so happy as to succeed at last  Mr Solmes said I if you have any regard for your own happiness  Mine  is out of the question You have not generosity enough to make  That  any part of your scheme prosecute no further your address It is but  just  to tell you that I could not bring my heart to think of you without the utmost disapprobation  before  I was used as I have beenAnd can you think I am such a slave such a  poor  slave  as to be brought to change my mind by the violent usage I have met with  And you Sir turning to my brother if you think that  meekness  always indicates  tameness  and that there is no  magnanimity  without  bluster  own yourself mistaken for once For you shall have reason to judge from henceforth that a generous mind is not to be forced and that  He lifted up his hands and eyes No more said the imperious wretch I charge youThen turning to my uncle Do you hear Sir This is your once faultless niece This is your favourite  Mr Solmes looked as if he knew not what to think of the matter and had I been left alone with him I saw plainly I could have got rid of him easily enough  My uncle came up to me looking up to my face and down to my feet And is it possible This can be  you  All this violence from  you  Miss Clary  Yes it is possible SirAnd I will presume to say this vehemence on my side is but the natural consequence of the usage I have met with and the rudeness I am treated with even in your presence by a brother who has no more right to controul me than I have to controul him  This usage cousin Clary was not till all other means were try'd with you  Try'd  to what end SirDo I contend for any thing more than a mere negative You  may  Sir turning to Mr Solmes  possibly  you may be induced the  rather  to persevere thus ungenerously as the usage I have met with for your sake and what you have now seen offered to me by my brother will shew you what I  can  bear were my evil destiny ever to make me yours  Lord Madam cried Solmes all this time distorted into twenty different attitudes as my brother and my uncle were blessing themselves and speaking only to  each other by their eyes and by their working features Lord Madam what a construction is This  A fair construction Sir interrupted I For he that can see a person he pretends to value thus treated and approve of it must be capable of treating her thus himself And that you  do  approve of it is evident by your declared perseverance when you know I am confined banished and insulted in order to make me consent to be what I never  can be  And this let me tell you as I have often told others not from motives of obstinacy but  aversion    Excuse me Sir turning to my uncleTo you as to my  papa  's brother I owe duty I beg  your  pardon that I cannot obey you But as for my  brother  he is  but  my brother he shall not constrain me And turning to my brother Knit your brows Sir and frown as you will I will ask you Would  you  in my case make the sacrifices I am willing to make to obtain every one's favour If  not  what right have you to treat me thus and to procure me to be treated as I have been for so long past  I had put myself by this time into great disorder They were silent and seemed to want to talk to one another by their looks walking about in violent disorders too between whilesI sat down fanning myself as it happened against the glass and I could perceive my colour go and come and being sick to the very heart and apprehensive of fainting I rung Betty came in I called for a glass of water and drank itBut nohody minded meI heard my brother pronounce the words Art dd Art to Solmes which I suppose kept  him  back together w  th the apprehension that he would not be welcomeElse I could see the man was more affected than my brother And I still fearing I should faint rising took hold of Betty's arm staggering with extreme disorder yet courtesying to my uncle Let me hold by you Betty said I Let me withdraw  Whither go you niece said my uncle We have not done with you yet I charge you depart not Mr Solmes has something to open to you that will astonish youAnd you  shall  hear it  Only Sir by your leave for a few minutes into the airI will return if you command itI will hear all that I am to hear that it may be over  Now  and  forEver  You will go with me Betty  And so without any farther prohibition I retired into the garden and there casting myself upon the first seat and throwing Betty's apron over my face leaning against her side my hands between her's I gave way to a violent burst of grief or passion or both which as it seemed saved my heart from breaking for I was sensible of an immediate relief  I have already given you specimens of Mrs Betty's impertinence I shall not therefore trouble you with more For the wench notwithstanding this my distress took great liberties with me after she saw me a little recovered and as I walked further into the garden insomuch that I was obliged to silence her by an absolute prohibition of saying another word to me and then she dropped behind me quite sullen and gloomy  It was near an hour before I was sent for in again The messenger was my cousin Dolly Hervey who with an eye of compassion and respect for Miss Hervey always loved me and calls herself my scholar as you know told me my company was desired  Betty left us  Who commands my attendance Miss said IHave you not been in tears my dear  Who can forbear tears said she  Why what's the matter cousin DollySure nobody is intitled to weep in this family but I  Yes I am Madam said she because I love you  I kissed her And is it for me my sweet cousin that you shed tearsThere never was love lost between  us But tell me what is designed to be done with me that I have this kind instance of your compassion for me  You must take no notice of what I tell you But my mamma has been weeping for you too with me but durst not let anybody see it O my Dolly said my mamma there never was so set a malice in man as in your cousin James Harlowe They will ruin the flower and ornament of their family  As how Miss DollyDid she not explain herselfAs how my dear  Yes she said Mr Solmes would have given up his claim to you for he said you hated him and there were no hopes and your mamma was willing he should and to have you taken at your word to renounce Mr Lovelace and to live single My mamma was for it too for they heard all that passed between you and my uncle Antony and my cousin James saying it was impossible to think of prevailing upon you to have Mr Solmes My uncle Harlowe seemed in the same way of thinking at least my mamma says he did not say any thing to the contrary But your papa was immoveable and was angry at your mamma and mine upon it And hereupon your brother your sister and my uncle Antony joined in and changed the scene intirely In short she says that Mr Solmes had great matters ingaged to him He owned that you were the finest young Lady in England and he would be content to be but little beloved if he could  not  after marriage engage your heart for the sake of having the honour to call you his but for one twelvemonthI suppose he would break your heart in the nextFor he is a cruelhearted man I am sure  My friends may break my heart cousin Dolly but Mr Solmes will never have it in his power  I don't know That Miss You'll have good luck to avoid having him by what I can find for my  mamma says they are all now of one mind herself excepted and she is forced to be silent your papa and brother are both so outragious  I am got above minding my brother cousin Dolly He is  but  my brotherBut to my papa I owe duty and obedience if I could comply  We are apt to be fond of anybody who will side with us when oppressed or provoked I always loved my cousin Dolly but now she endeared herself to me ten times more by her soothing concern for me I asked what  she  would do were she in my case  Without hesitation she replied Have Mr Lovelace outofhand and take up her own estate if she were me and there would be an end of itAnd Mr Lovelace she said was a fine gentlemanMr Solmes was not worthy to  buckle his shoes    Miss Hervey told me further that her mamma was desired to come to me to fetch me in but she excused herself I should have all my friends she said she believed sit in judgment upon me  I wish it had been so But as I have been told since neither my papa nor my mamma would trust themselves with me The one for passionsake it seems my mamma for tenderer considerations  By this time we entered the house Miss accompanied me into the parlour and left me as a person devoted I just then thought  Nobody was there I sat down and had leisure to weep reflecting with a sad heart upon what my cousin Dolly had told me  They were all in my sister's parlour adjoining For I heard a confused mixture of voices some louder than others drowning as it seemed the more compassionating accents  Female  accents I could distinguish the drowned ones to be O my dear What a hardhearted Sex is the other Children of the same parents how came they by their crueltyDo they get it by travel Do  they get it by conversation with one anotherOr how do they get itYet my sister too is as hardhearted as any of them But this may be no exception neither For she has been thought to be masculine in her air and in her spirit She has then perhaps a soul of the  other  Sex in a body of  ours  And so for the honour of  our own  will I judge of every woman for the future who imitating the rougher manners of men acts unbeseeming the gentleness of her own sex  Forgive me my dear friend breaking into my story by these reflections Were I rapidly to pursue my narration without thinking without reflecting I believe I should hardly be able to keep in my right mind Since vehemence and passion would then be always uppermost but while I  think  as I write I cool and my hurry of spirits is allayed  I believe I was above a quarter of an hour enjoying my own comfortless contemplations before anybody came in to me for they seemed in full debate My aunt looked in first O my dear said she are you there and withdrew hastily to apprise them of it  And then as agreed upon I suppose in came my uncle Antony crediting Mr Solmes with the words  Let me lead you in my dear friend  having hold of his hand while the newmade Beau aukwardly followed but more edgingly as I may say setting his feet mincingly to avoid treading upon his leader's heels Excuse me my dear this seeming levity but those we do not love in every thing are ungraceful with us  I stood up My uncle looked very surlySit downsit down girlAnd drawing a chair near me he placed his  dear  friend in it whether he would or not I having taken my seat And my uncle sat on the other side of me  Well niece taking my hand we shall have very little more to say to you than we have already said as to the subject that is so distasteful to youUnless indeed you have better considered of the matterAnd first let me know if you have  The matter wants no consideration Sir  Very well very well  Madam  said my uncle withdrawing his hands from mine Could I ever have thought of this from you  For God's sake dearest Madam said Mr Solmes folding his handsAnd there he stopped  For God's sake  what  SirHow came God's sake and your sake I pray you to be the same  This silenc'd  him  My uncle could  only  be angry and that he was before  Well well well Mr Solmes said my uncle no more of supplication You have not confidence enough to expect a woman's favour  He then was pleased to hint what great things he had designed to do for me and that it was more for  my  sake after he returned from the Indies than for the sake of any  other  of the family that he had resolved to live a single lifeBut now concluded he that the perverse girl despises all the great things it was once as much in my will as in my power to do for her I will change my measures  I told him that I most sincerely thanked him for all his kind intentions to me But that I was willing to resign all claim to any  other  of his favours than kind looks and kind words  He looked about him this way and that  Mr Solmes looked pitifully down  But both being silent I was sorry I added that I had too much reason to say a very harsh thing as it might be thought which was That if he would but be pleased to convince my brother and sister that he was absolutely determined to alter his generous purposes towards me it might possibly procure me  better quarter from both than I was otherwise likely to have  My uncle was very much displeased But he had not the opportunity to express his displeasure as he seemed prepared to do for in came my brother in exceeding great wrath and called me several vile names His success hitherto had set him above keeping even decent measures  Was This my spiteful construction he askedWas This the interpretation I put upon his brotherly care of me and concern for me in order to prevent my ruining myself  It  is  indeed it  is  said I I know no other way to account for your late behaviour to me And before your face I repeat my request to my uncle and I will make it to my other uncle whenever I am permitted to see him that they will confer all their favours upon you and my sister and only make me happy It is all I wish for in their kind looks and kind words  How they all gazed upon one anotherBut could I be less peremptory before the man  And as to  your  care and concern for me Sir turning to my brother once more I desire it not You are but my brother My papa and mamma I bless God are both living and were they  not  you have given me abundant rea  on to say that you are the very last person I would wish to have any concern for me  How Niece And is a Brother an  only  Brother of so little consideration with you as this comes to And ought he to have no concern for his sister's honour and the family's honour  My  honour SirI desire none of his concern for That It never was endanger'd till it had his undesired concernForgive me SirBut when my brother knows how to act like a brother or behave like a gentleman he may deserve more consideration from me than it is possible for me to think he now does  I thought my brother would have beat me upon thisBut my uncle stood between us  Violent girl however he called meWho said he would have thought it of her  Then was Mr Solmes told that I was unworthy of his pursuit  But Mr Solmes warmly took my part He could not bear he said that I should be treated so roughly  And so very much did he exert himself on this occasion and so patiently was his warmth received by my brother that I began to suspect that it was a contrivance to make me think myself obliged to him and that it might perhaps be one end of the pressedfor interview  The very suspicion of this low artifice violent as I was thought to be before put me still more out of patience and my uncle and my brother again praising his wonderful generosity and his noble return of good for evil You are a happy man Mr Solmes said I that you can so  easily  confer obligations upon a whole family except one ingrateful person of it whom you seem to intend  most  to oblige but who being made unhappy by your favour deserves not to owe to  you  any protection from the violence of a brother  Then was I a rude an ingrateful an unworthy creature  I own it allAll all you can call me or think me brother do I own I own my own unworthiness with regard to This gentleman I take your word for his abundant merit which I have neither leisure nor inclination to examine intoIt may perhaps be as great as your ownBut yet I cannot thank him for his mediation For who sees not looking at my uncle that this is giving himself a merit with everybody at my expence  Then turning to my brother who seemed surprised into silence by my warmth I must also acknowlege  Sir the favour of  your  superabundant care for me But I discharge you of it at least while I have the happiness of nearer and dearer relations You have given me no reason to think better of  your  prudence than of my  own  I am independent of  You  Sir tho' I never desire to be so of my Father And altho' I wish for the good opinion of my Uncles it is  All  I wish for from Them And This Sir I repeat to make you and my sister easy  Instantly almost came in Betty in a great hurry looking at me as spitefully as if she were my  sister  Sir said she to my brother my master desires to speak to you this moment at the door  He went to that which led into my sister's parlour and this sentence I heard thundered from the mouth of one who had a right to all my reverence Son James let the rebel be this moment carried away to my brother'sThis very momentShe shall not stay one hour more under my roof  I trembled I was ready to sink Yet not knowing what I did or said I flew to the door and would have opened itBut my brother pulled it to and held it close by the keyO my papamy dear papa said I falling upon my knees at the dooradmit your child to your presenceLet me but plead my cause at your feetO reprobate not thus your distressed daughter  My uncle put his handkerchief to his eyes Mr Solmes made a still more grievous face than he had before But my brother's marble heart was untouched  I will not stir from my knees continued I without admissionAt this door I beg itO let it be the door of mercy And open it to me honoured Sir I beseech youBut this once this once altho' you were afterwards to shut it against me for ever  The door was endeavoured to be opened on the inside which made my brother let go the key on a  sudden and I pressing against it all the time remaining on my knees fell flat on my face into the other parlour however without hurting myself But everybody was gone except Betty who helped to raise me up and I looked round that apartment and seeing nobody there reentered the other leaning upon Betty and then threw myself into the chair which I had sat in before and my eyes overflowed to my great relief While my uncle Antony my brother and Mr Solmes left me and went to my other relations  What passed among them I know not But my brother came in by the time I had tolerably recovered myself with a settled and haughty gloom upon his browYour father and mother command you instantly to prepare for your uncle Antony's You need not be solicitous about what you shall take with you You may give Betty your keys Take them Betty if the perverseone has them about her and carry them to her mother She will take care to send every thing after you that you shall want But another night you will not be permitted to stay in this house  I don't choose to give my keys to anybody except to my mamma and into her own hands You see how much I am disordered It may cost me my life to be hurried away so suddenly I beg to be indulged till next Monday at least  That will not be granted you So prepare for this very night And give up your keys Give them to  me  Miss I'll carry them to your mamma  Excuse me brother Indeed I won't  Indeed you must In no one instance comply Madam Clary  Not in this Sir  Have you any thing you are afraid should be seen by your mamma  Not if I be permitted to attend my mamma  I'll make a report accordingly  He went out  In came Miss Dolly Hervey I am sorry Madam to be the messengerBut your mamma insists upon your sending up all the keys of your cabinet library and drawers  Tell my mamma that I yield them up to her commands Tell her I make no conditions with my mamma But if she finds nothing she disapproves of I beg that she will permit me to tarry here a few days longerTry my Dolly the dear girl sobbing with grief Try if your gentleness cannot prevail for me  She wept still more and said It is sad very sad to see matters thus carried  She took the keys and wrapped her arms about me and begged me to excuse herAnd would have said more but Betty's presence awed her as I saw  Don't pity me my dear said I It will be imputed to you as a fault You see who is by  The insolent wench scornfully smiled One young Lady pitying another in things of this nature looks promising in the youngest I must needs say  I bid her for a saucy creature begone from my presence  She would most gladly she said were she not to stay about me by my mamma's order  It soon appeared for what she staid for I offering to go up stairs to my apartment when my cousin went from me with the keys she told me she was commanded to her very great regret she must own to desire me not to go up at present  Such a boldface as she I told her should not hinder me  She instantly rang the bell and in came my brother meeting me at the door  Return return MissNo going up yet  I went in again and throwing myself upon the windowseat wept bitterly  Shall I give you the particulars of a ridiculously spiteful conversation that passed between my brother  and me while he with Betty was in office to keep me in play and my closet was searchingBut I think I will not It can answer no good end  I desired several times while he stay'd to have leave to retire to my apartment but it was not permitted me The search I suppose was not over Bella was one of those employ'd in it They could not have a more diligent searcher How happy it was they were disappointed  But when my sister could not find the  cunning creature  's papers I was to stand another visit from Mr Solmespreceded now by my aunt Hervey sorely against her will I could see that accompany'd by my uncle Antony in order to keep her steady I suppose  But being a little heavy for it is now past Two in the morning I will lie down in my cloaths to indulge the kind summons if it will be indulged  Three o'Clock Wednesday Morning  I COULD not sleepOnly dozed away one halfhour  My aunt Hervey accosted me thusO my dear child what troubles do you give to your parents and to everybodyI wonder at you  I am sorry for it Madam  Sorry for it child  Why  then so very obstinateCome sit down my dear I will sit next you taking my hand  My uncle placed Mr Solmes on the other side of me Himself overagainst me almost close to me Finely beset now my dear Was I not  Your brother child said my aunt is too passionateHis zeal for  your  welfare pushes him on a little too vehemently  Very true said my uncle But no more of This We would now be glad to see if milder means will do with youTho' indeed they were tried before  I asked my aunt If it were necessary that That gentleman should be present  There is a reason that he should said my aunt as you will hear byandby But I must tell you first that thinking you was a little too angrily treated by your brother your mamma desired me to try what gentler means would do upon a spirit so generous as we used to think yours  Nothing can be done Madam I must presume to say if This gentleman's address be the end  She looked upon my uncle who bit his lip and looked upon Mr Solmes who rubbed his cheek and shaking her head Good dear creature said she be calmLet me ask you If something would have been done had you been gentler used than you seem to think you have been  No Madam I cannot say it would in this gentleman's favour You know Madam you know Sir to my uncle I ever valued myself upon my sincerity And once indeed had the happiness to be valued for it  My uncle took Mr Solmes aside I heard him say whisperingly She must she shall be still yoursWe'll see who'll conquer parents or child uncles or nieceI doubt not to be witness to all this being got over and many a goodhumour'd jest made of this high phrensy  I was heartily vexed  Tho' we cannot find out continued he yet we  guess  who puts her upon this obstinate behaviour It is not natural to her man Nor would I concern myself so much about her but that I know what I say to be true and intend to do great things for her  I will hourly pray for that happy time whisper'd as audibly Mr Solmes I never will revive the remembrance of what is now so painful to me  Well but niece I am to tell you said my aunt that the sending up your keys without making any conditions has wrought for you what nothing else  could have doneThat and the not finding anything that could give them umbrage together with Mr Solmes's interposition  O Madam let me not owe an obligation to Mr SolmesI cannot repay it except by my  thanks  and  those  only on condition that he will decline his suit To my thanks Sir turning to him if you have a heart capable of humanity if you have any esteem for me for my  own  sake I beseech you to intitle yourselfI beseech you do  O Madam cry'd he believe believe believe me it is impossibleWhile you are single I will hope While that hope is encouraged by so many worthy friends I must persevereI must not slight  them  Madam because you slight  me    I answered him with a look of high disdain and turning from himBut what favour dear Madam to my aunt has the instance of duty you mention procur'd me  Your mamma and Mr Solmes replied my aunt have prevailed that your request to stay here till Monday next shall be granted if you will promise to go chearfully then  Let me but choose my own visitors and I will go to my uncle's house with pleasure  Well niece said my aunt we must wave this subject I find We will now proceed to another which will require your utmost attention It will give you the reason why Mr Solmes's presence is requisite  Ay said my uncle and shew you what sort of a man Somebody is Mr Solmes pray favour us in the first place with the letter you received from your anonymous friend  I will Sir And out he pulled a lettercase and taking out a letter It is written in answer to one sent to the person It is superscribed  To Roger Solmes  Esq  It begins thus  Honoured Sir    I beg your pardon Sir said I But what pray is the intent of reading this letter to me  To let you know what a vile man you are thought to have set your heart upon said my uncle in an audible whisper  If Sir it be suspected that I have set my heart upon any other why is Mr Solmes to give himself any farther trouble about me  Only hear niece said my aunt Only hear what Mr Solmes has to read and to say to you on this head  If Madam Mr Solmes will be pleased to declare that he has no view to serve no end to promote for himself I will hear any thing he shall read But if the contrary you must allow me to say That it will abate with me a great deal of the weight of whatever he shall produce  Hear it but read niece said my aunt  Hear it read said my uncleYou are so ready to take part with  With anybody Sir that is accused anonymously and from interested motives  He began to read and there seemed to be a heavy load of charges in this letter against the poor criminal But I stopped the reading of it and said It will not be  my  fault if this vilified man be not as indifferent to me as one whom I never saw If he be otherwise at present which I neither own nor deny it proceeds from the strange methods taken to prevent it Do not let one cause unite him and me and we shall not be united If my offer to live single be accepted he shall be no more to me than  this  gentleman  StillProceed Mr SolmesHear it out niece was my uncle's cry  But to what purpose Sir said IHas not Mr Solmes a  view  in this And besides can anything  worse be said of Mr Lovelace than I have heard said for several months past  But this said my uncle and what Mr Solmes can tell you besides amounts to the  fullest proof    Was the unhappy man then so freely treated in his character before  without  full proof I beseech you Sir give me not  too good  an opinion of Mr Lovelace as I may have if such pains be taken to make him guilty by one who means not his reformation by it nor to do good if I may presume to say so in this case to anybody but himself  I see very plainly said my uncle your prepossession your fond prepossession for the person of a man without morals  Indeed my dear said my aunt you too much justify all our apprehensions Surprising that a young creature of virtue and honour should thus esteem a man of a quite opposite character  Dear Madam do not conclude against me too hastily I believe Mr Lovelace is far from being so good as he ought to be But if every man's private life were searched into by  prejudiced people  set on for that purpose I know not whose reputation would be safe I love a virtuous character as much in man as in woman I think it as requisite and as meritorious in the one as in the other And if left to myself I would prefer a person of such a character to Royalty without it  Why then said my uncle  Give me leave SirBut I may venture to say that many of those who have escaped censure have not merited applause  Permit me to observe further That Mr Solmes himself may not be absolutely faultless I never heard of his virtues Some vices I have heard ofExcuse me Mr Solmes I speak to your faceThe text about  casting the first stone  affords an excellent lesson  He looked down but was silent  Mr Lovelace may have vices  you  have not You may have others which  he  has notI speak not this to defend him or to accuse you No man is bad no one is good in  everything  Mr Lovelace for example is said to be implacable and to hate my friends that does not make me value him the more But give me leave to say That they hate  him  as bad Mr Solmes has his antipathies likewise very  strong  ones and those to his  own relations  which I don't find to be the other's fault for he lives well with  his  Yet he may have as badWorse pardon me he cannot have in my poor opinion For what must be the man who  hates his own flesh  You know not Madam All in one breath  You know not Niece All in one breath  You know not Clary All in one breath  I may not nor do I desire to know his reasons It concerns me not to know them But the world even the impartial part of it accuses him If the world is unjust or rash in  one  man's case why may it not be so in  another  's That's all I mean by it Nor can there be a greater sign of want of merit than where a man seeks to pull down another's character in order to build up his own  The poor man's face was all this time overspread with confusion it appearing as if he were ready to cry twisted as it were and all awry neither mouth nor nose standing in the middle of it And had he been capable of pitying me I had certainly tried to pity him  They all three gazed upon one another in silence My aunt I saw at least I thought so looked as if she would have been glad she might have appeared to approve of what I said She but feebly blamed me when she spoke for not hearing what Mr Solmes had to say He himself seemed not now very earnest to be heard My uncle said There was no talking to me And I should  have absolutely silenced both gentlemen had not my brother come in again to their assistance  This was the strange speech he made at his entrance his eyes flaming with anger This prating girl has struck you all dumb I perceive Persevere however Mr Solmes I have heard every word she has said And I know no other method of being even with her than after she is yours to make her as sensible of your power as she now makes you of her insolence  Fie cousin Harlowe said my auntCould I have thought a  brother  would have said this to a gentleman of a  sister  I must tell you Madam said he that  you  give the rebel courage You yourself seem to favour too much the arrogance of her sex in her otherwise she durst not have thus stopp'd her uncle's mouth by reflections upon him as well as denied to hear a gentleman tell her the danger she is in from a libertine whose protection as she has plainly hinted she intends to claim against her family  Stopped my uncle's mouth by reflexions upon him Sir  said I How can that be How  dare  you to make such an application as This  My aunt wept at his reflection upon herCousin said she to him If  This  be the thanks I have for my trouble I have done Your father would not treat me thusAnd I  will  say that the hint you gave was an unbrotherly one  Not more unbrotherly than all the rest of his conduct to me of late Madam said I I see by this specimen of his violence how everybody has been brought into his measures Had I any the least apprehension of ever being in Mr Solmes's power this  might  have affected me But you see Sir to Mr Solmes what a conduct is thought necessary to enable you to arrive at your ungenerous end You see how my brother  courts  for you  I disclaim Mr Harlowe's violence Madam with all my soul I will never remind you  Silence worthy Sir said I I will take care you never shall have the opportunity  Less violence Clary said my uncle Cousin James you are as much to blame as your sister  In then came my sister Brother said she you kept not your promise You are thought to be to blame within as well as here Were not Mr Solmes's generosity and affection to the girl  well  known what you have said would be inexcusable My papa desires to speak with you and with you aunt and with you uncle and with you Mr Solmes if you please  They all four withdrew into the next apartment  I stood silent as not knowing till she spoke how to take this intervention of my sister'sO thou perverse thing said she poking out her angry face at me when they were all gone but speaking spitefully lowWhat troubles do you give to us all  You and my brother Bella said I give trouble to yourselves for neither you nor he have any business to concern yourselves about me  She threw out some spiteful expressions still in a low voice as if she chose not to be heard without and I thought it best to oblige her to raise her tone a little if I could If I  could  did I say It is easy to make a passionate spirit answer all our views upon it  She accordingly flamed out in a raised tone And this brought my cousin Dolly in to us Miss Harlowe your company is desired  I will come presently cousin Dolly  But again provoking a severity from me which she could not bear and calling me names in once more came Dolly with another message that her company was desired  Not mine I doubt Miss Dolly said I  The sweettemper'd girl burst out into tears and shook her head  Go in before me child said Bella vexed to set her concern for me with thy sharp face like a new moon What dost thou cry for Is it to make thy keen face look still keener  I believe Bella was blamed too when she went in for I heard her say The  creature  was so provoking there was no keeping a resolution  Mr Solmes after a little while came in again by himself to take leave of me Full of scrapes and compliments but too well tutored and encouraged to give me hope of his declining He begged me not to impute to him any of the severe things to which he had been a sorrowful witness He besought my compassion as he called it  He said the result was That he had still hopes given him and altho' discouraged by me he was resolved to persevere while I remained singleAnd such long and such painful services he talk'd of as never were heard of  I told him in the strongest manner what he had to trust to  Yet still he determined to persistWhile I was no man's else he must hope  What said I will you still persist when I declare as I now do that my affections are engagedAnd let my brother make the most of it  He knew my principles and adored me for them  He doubted not that it was in his power to make me happy And he was sure I would not want the will to be so  I assured him that were I to be carried to my uncle's it should answer no end for I would never see him nor receive a line from him nor hear a word in his favour whoever were the person who should mention him to me  He was sorry for it He must be miserable were I to hold in that mind But he doubted not that I might be induced by my father and uncles to change it  Never never he might depend upon it  It was richly worth his patience and the trial  At my  expence  At the price of all my  happiness  Sir  He hoped I should be induced to think otherwise  And then would he have run into his fortune his settlements his affectionVowing that never man loved a woman with so sincere a passion as he loved me  I stopp'd him as to the first part of his speech And to the second of the sincerity of his passionWhat then Sir said I is your love to one who must assure you that never young creature looked upon man with a sincerer disapprobation than I look upon you And tell me What argument can you urge that this  true  declaration answers not beforehand  Dearest Madam what can I sayOn my knees I beg  And down the ungraceful wretch dropp'd on his knees  Let me not kneel in vain Madam Let me not be thus despisedAnd he looked most odiously sorrowful  I have kneeled too Mr Solmes Often have I kneeled And I will kneel againEven to  you  Sir will I kneel if there be so much merit in kneeling provided you will not be the implement of my cruel brother's undeserved persecution  If all the services even to worship you during my whole lifeYou Madam invoke and expect mercy yet shew none  Am I to be cruel to myself to shew mercy to youTake my estate Sir with all my heart since you are such a favourite in This houseOnly leave me  myself  The mercy you ask for do  you  shew to others  It you mean to my relations Madamunworthy as they are all shall be done that you shall prescribe  Who I Sir to find you bowels you naturally have not I to purchase  their  happiness by the forfeiture  of  my own  What I ask you for is mercy to myself That since you seem to have some power over my relations you will use it in my behalf Tell them that you see I cannot conquer my aversion to you Tell them if you are a wise man that you value too much your own happiness to risque it against such a determin'd antipathy Tell them that I am unworthy of your offers And that in mercy to yourself as well as to me you will not prosecute a suit so impossible to be granted  I will risque all consequences said the fell wretch rising with a countenance whiten'd over as if with malice his hollow eyes flashing fire and biting his underlip to shew he could be  manly  Your hatred Madam shall be no objection with me And I doubt not in a few days to have it in my power to shew you  YOU have it in your power Sir  He came well off  To shew you  more generosity than noble as you are said to be to others you shew to me  The man's face became his anger It seems form'd to express the passion  At that instant again came in my brotherSister sister sister said he with his teeth set act on the termagant part you have so newly assumedMost wonderfully well does it become you It is but a short one however Tyranness in your turn accuse others of your own guiltBut leave her leave her Mr Solmes her time is short You'll find her humble and mortify'd enough very quicklyThen how like a little tame fool will she look with her conscience upbraiding her and begging of you with a whining voice the barbarous brother spoke to forgive and forget  More he said as he flew out with a face as red as scarlet upon Shorey's coming in to recal him on his violence  I removed from chair to chair excessively frighted and disturbed at this brutal treatment  The man attempted to excuse himself as being sorry for my brother's passion  Leave me leave me Sir fanningor I shall faint And indeed I thought I should  He recommended himself to my favour with an air of assurance augmented as I thought by a distress so visible in me for he even snatched my trembling my struggling hand and ravish'd it to his odious mouth  I flung from him with high disdain And he withdrew bowing and cringing selfgratify'd and enjoying as I thought the confusion he saw me in  The creature is now methinks before me and now I see him aukwardly striding backward as he retired till the edge of the open'd door which he run against remember'd him to turn his welcome back upon me  Upon his withdrawing Betty brought me word that I was permitted to go up to my own chamber And was bid to consider of everything For my time was short Nevertheless she believed I might be permitted to stay till Saturday  She tells me That altho' my brother and sister were blam'd for being so  hasty  with me yet when they made  their  report and my uncle Antony  his  of my provocations they were all more determin'd than ever in Mr Solmes's favour  The wretch himself she tells me pretends to be more in love with me than before and to be rather delighted than discouraged with the conversation that passed between us He run on she says in raptures about the grace wherewith I should dignify his board and the like sort of stuff either of  his  saying or  her  making  She closed all with a Now is my time to submit with a grace and to make my own terms with him  Else  she  can tell me were  she  Mr Solmes it should be worse for me And who Miss of  our  sex proceeded the saucy creature would admire a rakish gentleman when she might be admired by a sober one to the end of the chapter  The creature tells me I have had  amazing  good luck to keep my writings concealed so cunningly▪ I must needs think that she knows I am always at my pen And as I endeavour to hide that knowlege from her she is not obliged to keep my secret But that she loves not to aggravate She had rather reconcile by much Peacemaking is her talent and ever was And had she been as much my foe as I imagined I had not perhaps been here nowBut this however she said not to make a merit with me For truly it would be better for me the sooner everything was over with me And better for her and everyone else that was certainYet one hint she must conclude with that my pen and ink she would assure me soon as I was to go away would not be long in my power And then having lost  that  amusement it would be seen how a mind so active as mine would be able to employ itself  This hint has such an effect upon me that I shall instantly begin to conceal in different places pens ink and paper and to deposite some in the ivysummerhouse if I can find a safe place and at the worst I have got a pencil of black and another of red lead which I use in my drawings and my patterns shall serve for paper if I have no other  How lucky it was that I had got away my papers They made a strict search for them That I can see by the disorderly manner they have left all things in For you know that I am such an observer of method that I can go to a bit of ribband or lace or edging blindfold The same in my books which they have strangely disordered and mismatched to look  behind  them and  in  some of them I suppose My cloaths  too are rumpled not a little No place has escaped them To your hint I thank you are they indebted for their disappointment  The pen thro' heaviness and fatigue dropp'd out of my fingers at the word  indebted  I resume it to finish the sentence and to tell you that I am  Your forever obliged and affectionate CL HARLOWE  LETTER XXXII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Wednesday Eleven o' Clock April  I Must write as I have opportunity making use of my concealed stores For my pens and ink all of each that they could find are taken from me as I shall tell you more particularly byandby  About an hour ago I deposited my long letter to you as also in the usual place a billet to Mr Lovelace lest his impatience should put him upon some rashness signifying in four lines  'That the interview was over and that I hoped my steady refusal of Mr Solmes would discourage any further applications to me in his favour'  Altho' I was unable through the fatigue I had undegone and by reason of sitting up all night to write to you which made me lie longer than ordinary this morning to deposit my letter to you sooner yet I hope you will have it in such good time as that you will be able to send me an answer to it this night or in the morning early which if ever so short will inform me whether I may depend upon your mamma's indulgence or not This it behoves me to know as soon as possible for they are resolved to hurry me away on Saturday next at farthest perhaps tomorrow  I will now inform you of all that happen'd previous  to their taking away my pen and ink as well as of the manner in which that act of violence as I may call it was committed and this as briefly as I can  My aunt who with Mr Solmes and my two uncles lives here I think came up to me and said she would fain have me hear what Mr Solmes had to say of Mr LovelaceOnly that I might be apprised of some things that would convince me what a vile man he is and what a wretched husband he must makeI might give them what degree of credit I pleased and take them with abatement for Mr Solmes's interestedness if I thought fitBut it might be of use to me were it but to question Mr Lovelace indirectly upon some of them that related to  myself    I was indifferent I said about what he could say of me as I was sure it could not be to my disadvantage and as  he  had no reason to impute to me the forwardness which my unkind friends had so causelesly taxed me with  She said That he gave himself high airs on account of his family and spoke as despicably of ours as if an alliance with  us  were beneath him  I reply'd That he was a very unworthy man if it were true to speak slightingly of a family which was as good as his own 'bating that it was not allied to the peerage That the dignity itself I thought convey'd more shame than honour to descendents who had not merit to adorn as well as to be adorned by it That my brother's absurd pride indeed which made him everywhere declare he would never marry but to  quality  gave a disgraceful preference against ours But that were I to be assured that Mr Lovelace were capable of so mean a pride as to insult us or value himself on such an accidental advantage I should think as despicably of his sense as everybody else did of his morals  She insisted upon it that he  had  taken such liberties  and offer'd to give some instances which she said would surprise me  I answer'd That were it ever so certain that Mr Lovelace had taken such liberties it would be but common justice so much hated as he was by all our family and so much inveighed against in all companies by them to inquire into the provocation he had to say what was imputed to him and whether the value some of my friends put upon the riches they possess throwing perhaps contempt upon every other advantage and even discrediting  their own  pretensions to family in order to depreciate  his  might not provoke him to like contempts Upon the whole Madam said I can you say that the inveteracy lies not as much on  our  side as on  his  Can  he  say anything of  us  more disrespectful than  we  say of himAnd as to the suggestion so often repeated that he would make a bad husband is it possible for him to use a wife worse than I am used particularly by my brother and sister  Ah niece ah my dear how firmly has this wicked man attached you  Perhaps not Madam But really great care should be taken by fathers and mothers when they would have their daughters of  their  minds in these particulars not to say things that shall necessitate the child in honour and generosity to take part with the man her friends are averse to But waving all this as I have offered to renounce him for ever I see not why he should be mentioned to me nor why I should be wished to hear anything about him  Well but still my dear there can be no harm to let Mr Solmes tell you what Mr Lovelace has said of  you  Severely as you have treated Mr Solmes he is fond of attending you once more He begs to be heard on this head  If it be proper for me to hear it Madam  It  is  eagerly interrupted she very proper  Has what he has said of  me  Madam convinced  you  of Mr Lovelace's baseness  It has my dear And that you ought to abhor him for it  Then dear Madam be pleased to let me hear it from  your  mouth There is no need that I should see Mr  Solmes  when it will have double the weight from  you  What Madam has the man dared to say of  me  My aunt was quite at a loss  At last Well said she I see how you are attached I am sorry for it Miss For I do assure you it will signify nothing You must be Mrs Solmes and that in a very few days  If consent of heart and assent of voice be necessary to a marriage I am sure I never can nor ever will be married to Mr Solmes And what will any of my relations be answerable for if they force my hand into his and hold it there till the Service be read I perhaps insensible and in fits all the time  What a romantic picture of a forced marriage have you drawn niece Some people would say you have given a fine description of your own obstinacy child  My brother and sister would But you Madam distinguish I am sure between obstinacy and aversion  Supposed aversion may owe its rise to real obstinacy my dear  I know my own heart Madam I wish  you  did  Well but see Mr Solmes once more niece It wil  oblige and make for you more than you imagine  What should I see him for MadamIs the man fond of hearing me declare my aversion to himIs he desirous of having me more and more incense my friends against myselfO my cunning my ambition brother  Ah my dearwith a look of pity as if she under+stood the meaning of my exclamationBut mus  That necessarily be the case  It must Madam if they will take offence at me for declaring my stedfast detestation of Mr Solmes as a husband  Mr Solmes is to be pitied said she He adores you He longs to see you once more He loves you the better for your cruel usage of him yesterday He is in raptures about you  Ugly creature thought I He in raptures  What a cruel wretch must He be said I who can enjoy the distress he so largely contributes toBut I see I see Madam that I am consider'd as an animal to be baited to make sport for my brother and sister and Mr Solmes They are all all of them wanton in their cruelty  I  Madam see the manthe man so incapable of pityIndeed I won't see him if I can help itIndeed I won't  What a construction does your lively wit put upon the admiration Mr Solmes expresses of youPassionate as you were yesterday and contemptuously as you treated him he dotes upon you for the very severity he suffers by He is not so ungenerous a man as you think him Nor has he an unfeeling heartLet me prevail upon you my dear as your  father  and  mother  expect it of you to see him once more and hear what he has to say to you  How can I consent to see him again when yesterday's interview was interpreted by you Madam as well as by every other as an encouragement to him When I myself declared that if I saw him a  second  time by my own consent it might be so taken And when I am determined never to encourage him  You might spare your reflections upon  me  Miss I have no thanks either from one side or the other  And away she flung  Dearest Madam said I following her to the door  But she would not hear me further and her sudden breaking from me occasioned a hurry to some  mean listener as the slipping of a foot from the landingplace on the stairs discovered to me  I had scarcely recovered myself from this attack when up came Betty with a Miss your company is desired belowstairs in your own parlour  By whom Betty  How can I tell MissPerhaps by your sister perhaps by your brotherI know they won't come upstairs to your apartment again  Is Mr Solmes gone Betty  I believe he is MissWould you have him sent for back said the bold creature  Down I went And who should I be sent for down to but my brother and Mr Solmes The latter standing sneaking behind the door that I saw him not till I was mockingly led by the hand into the room by my brother And then I started as if I had beheld a ghost  You are to sit down Clary  And what then brother  Why then you are to put off that scornful look and hear what Mr Solmes has to say to you  Sent for down to be baited again thought I  Madam said Mr Solmes as if in haste to speak lest he should not have opportunity given him and he judged right Mr Lovelace is a declared  marriagehater  and has a design upon your honour if ever  Base accuser said I in a passion snatching my hand from my brother who was insolently motioning to give it to Mr Solmes he has nothe dares not But  you  have if endeavouring to force a free mind is to dishonour it  O thou violent creature said my brotherBut not gone yetfor I was rushing away  What mean you Sir struggling vehemently to get away to detain me thus against my will  You shall not go violence clasping his unbrotherly arms about me  Then let not Mr Solmes stayWhy hold you me thus He shall not for  your own  sake if I can help it see how barbarously a brother can treat a sister who deserves not evil treatment  And I struggled so vehemently to get from him that he was forced to quit my hand which he did with these wordsBegone then FuryHow strong is willThere is no holding her  And up I flew to my chamber again and locked myself in trembling and out of breath  In less than a quarter of an hour up came Betty I let her in upon her tapping and asking half out of breath too for admittance  The Lord have mercy upon us said sheWhat a  confusion of a house  is ThisHurrying up and down fanning herself with her handkerchiefSuch angry masters and mistresses Such an obstinate young ladySuch an humble loverSuch enraged unclesSuchO dear dear What a topsyturvy house is ThisAnd all for what trowOnly because a young Lady  may  be happy and will  not  Only because a young Lady  will  have a husband and will  not  have a husbandWhat hurlyburlies are here where all used to be peace and quietness  Thus she ran on talking to herself while I sat as patiently as I could being assured that her errand was not designed to be a welcome one to me to observe when her soliloquy would end  At last turning to meI must do as I am bid I can't help itDon't be angry with me Miss But I must carry down your pen and ink And that this moment  By whose order  By your papa's and mamma's  How shall I know that  She offered to go to my closet I stept in before her Touch it if you dare  Up came my cousin DollyMadamMadam said the poor weeping goodnatured creature in broken sentencesYou mustindeed you mustdeliver to Bettyor to meyour pen and ink  Must I my sweet cousin Then I will to you but not to this bold body And so I gave my standish to her  I am sorry very sorry said Miss to be the messenger But your papa will not have you in the same house with him He is resolved you shall be carried away tomorrow or Saturday at farthest And therefore your pen and ink is taken away that you may give nobody notice of it  And away went the dear girl very sorrowfully carrying down with her my standish and all its furniture and a little parcel of pens beside which having been seen when the great search was made she was bid to ask for As it happened I had not diminished it having half a dozen Crowquills which I had hid in as many different places It was lucky for I doubt not they had told how many were in the parcel  Betty run on telling me that my mamma was now as much incensed against me as anybodyThat my doom was fixedThat my violent behaviour had not left one to plead for me That Mr Solmes bit his lip and mumbled and seemed to have more in his head than could come out at his mouth that was her phrase  And yet she also hinted to me that the cruel creature took pleasure in seeing me altho' so much to my disgustAnd so wanted to see me again Must he not be a savage my dear  The wench went onThat my uncle Harlowe said That now  he  gave me upThat he pitied Mr SolmesYet hoped he would not think of This to my detriment hereafter That my uncle Antony was of opinion That I ought to smart for it  And  for  her  partAnd then as one of the family she gave her opinion of the same side  As I have no other way of hearing any thing that is said or intended below I bear sometimes more patiently than I otherwise should do with her impertinence And indeed she seems to be in all my brother's and sister's counsels  Miss Hervey came up again and demanded an halfpint inkbottle which they had seen in my closet  I gave it her without hesitation  If they have no suspicion of my being able to write they will perhaps let me stay longer than otherwise they would  This my dear is now my situation  All my dependence all my hopes is in your mamma's favour But for That I know not what I might do For who can tell what will come next  LETTER XXXIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Wednesday Four o'Clock in the Afternoon  I Am just returned from depositing the letter I so lately finished and such of Mr Lovelace's letters as I had not sent you My long letter I found remaining thereSo you'll have both together  I am concerned methinks it is not with youBut your servant cannot always be at leisure However I'll deposite as fast as I write I must keep nothing by me now and when I write lock myself in that I may not be surprised now they think I have no pen and ink  I found in the usual place another letter from this diligent man And by its contents a confirmation that nothing passes in this house but he knows it and that as soon as it passes For this letter must have been written before he could have received my  billet and deposited I suppose when that was taken away yet he compliments me in it upon asserting myself as he calls it on that occasion to my uncle and to Mr Solmes  'He assures me however that they are more and 'more determin'd to subdue me  'He sends me the compliments of his family and acquaints me with their earnest desire to see me amongst them Most vehemently does he press for my quitting This house while it is in my power to get away And again craves leave to order his uncle's chariotandsix to attend my orders at the style leading to the coppice adjoining to the paddock  'Settlements to my own will he again offers Lord M and both his aunts to be guaranties of his honour and justice But if I choose not to go to either of his aunts nor yet to make him the happiest of men so soon as it is nevertheless his hope that I will he urges me to withdraw to my own house and to accept of my Lord M for my guardian and protector till my cousin Morden arrives He can contrive he says to give me easy possession of it and will fill it with his female relations on the first invitation from me and Mrs Norton or Miss Howe may be undoubtedly prevailed upon to be with me for a time There can be no pretence for litigation he says when I am once in it Nor if I choose to have it so will he appear to visit me nor presume to mention marriage to me till all is quiet and easy till every method I shall prescribe for a reconciliation with my friends is try'd till my cousin comes till such settlements are drawn as he shall approve of for me and that I have unexceptionable proofs of his own good behaviour'  As to the disgrace a person of my character may be apprehensive of upon quitting my father's house he observes too truly I doubt  'That the treatment  I meet with is in every one's mouth Yet he says that the public voice is in my favour My friends themselves he says  expect  that I will do myself what he calls this justice why else do they confine me He urges that thus treated the independence I have a right to will be my sufficient excuse going but from their house to my own if I choose that measure or in order to take possession of my own if I do not That all the disgrace I  can  receive they have already given me That his concern and his family's concern  in  my honour will be equal to my own if he may be so happy ever to call me his And he presumes to aver that no family can better supply the loss of my own friends to me than his in whatever way I do them the honour to accept of his and their protection  'But he repeats that in all events he will oppose my being carried to my uncle's being well assured that I shall be lost to him for ever if once I enter into that house'  He tells me  'That my brother and sister and Mr Solmes design to be there to receive me That my father and mother will not come near me till the ceremony is actually over And that then they will appear in order to try to reconcile me to my odious husband by urging upon me the obligations I shall be supposed to be under from a double duty'  How my dear am I driven between bothThis last intimation is but a too probable one All the steps they take seem to tend to this And indeed they have declared almost as much  He owns  'That he has already taken his measures upon this intelligenceBut that he is so desirous for  my sake  I must  suppose  he says that he owes  them  no forbearance  for their own  to avoid coming to extremities that he has suffer'd a person whom they do not suspect to acquaint them as if unknown to himself with his resolutions if they persist  in their design to carry me by violence to my uncle's in hopes that they may be induced from fear of mischief to  change  their measures Altho' he runs a risque if he cannot be benefited by their fears from their doubly guarding themselves against him on this intimation'  What a dangerous enterprizer however is this man  'He begs a few lines from me by way of answer to this letter either This evening or tomorrow morningIf he be not so favour'd he shall conclude from what he knows of their fixed determination that I shall be under a closer restraint than before And he shall be obliged to take his measures according to that presumption'  You will see by this abstract as well as by his letter preceding This for both run in the same strain how strangely forward the difficulty of my situation has brought him in his declarations and proposals and in his threatenings too Which but for That I would not take from him  Something however I must speedily resolve upon or it will be out of my power to help myself  Now I think of it I will inclose his letter so might have spared the abstract of it that you may the better judge of all his proposals and intelligence and lest it should fall into other hands I cannot forget the contents altho' I am at a loss what answer to return  I cannot bear the thoughts of throwing myself upon the protection of his friendsBut I will not examine his proposals closely till I hear from you Indeed I have no  eligible  hope but in your mamma's goodness  Hers  is a protection I could more  reputably  fly to than to That of any other person And from hers should be ready to return to my father's for the breach then would not be irreparable as it would be if I fled to his family  To return  I repeat  on such terms as shall secure but my  negative  not my  Independence  I do not aim at That so shall lay your mamma under the less difficulty altho' I have a right to it if I were to insist upon itSuch a right I mean as my brother exerts in the estate left  him  and which nobody disputesGod forbid that I should ever think myself freed from my father's  reasonable  controul whatever right my grandfather's will has given me He good gentleman left me that estate as a reward of my duty and not to set me above it as has been justly hinted to me And this reflection makes me more fearful of not answering the intention of so valuable a bequestO that my friends knew but my heartWould but think of it as they used to doFor once more I say If it deceive me not it is not altered altho' theirs are  Would but your mamma permit you to send her chariot or chaise to the byeplace where Mr Lovelace proposes his uncle's shall come provoked intimidated and apprehensive as I am I would not hesitate a moment what to doPlace me anywhere as I have said beforeIn a cott in a garret anywhereDisguised as a servantor let me pass as a servant's sisterSo that I may but escape Mr Solmes on one hand and the disgrace of refuging with the family of a man at enmity with my own on the other and I shall be in some measure happyShould your good mamma refuse me what resuge or whose can I fly toDearest creature advise your distressed friend  I BROKE off hereI was so excessively uneasy that I durst not trust myself with my own reflections So went down to the garden to try to calm my mind by shifting the scene I took but one turn upon the filbeard walk when Betty came to me Here Miss is your PapaHere is your uncle Antony  Here is my young masterand my young mistress coming to take a walk in the garden and your papa sends me to see where you are for fear he should meet you  I struck into an oblique path and got behind the yewhedge seeing my sister appear and there concealed myself till they were gone past me  My mamma it seems is not well My poor mamma keeps her chamberShould she be worse I should have an additional unhappiness in apprehension that my reputed undutifulness has touched her heart  You cannot imagine what my emotions were behind the yewhedge on seeing my papa so near meI was glad to look at him thro' the hedge as he passed by But I trembled in every joint when I heard him utter  these  words Son James To you and to Bella and to You brother do I wholly commit this matterFor that I was meant I cannot doubt And yet why was I so affected since I may be said to have been given up to their cruelty for many days past  WHILE my papa remained in the garden I sent my dutiful compliments to my mamma with inquiry after her health by Shorey whom I met accidentally upon the stairs for none of the servants except my gaoleress dare to throw themselves in my way I had the mortification of such a return as made me repent my message tho' not my concern for her health Let her not inquire after the disorders she occasions was the harsh answer I will not receive any compliments from her  Very very hard my dear Indeed it is very hard  I HAVE the pleasure to hear my mamma is already better however A colicky disorder to which she is too subjectAnd it is hoped is gone offGod send it mayEvery evil that happens in this house is owing to me  This good news was told me with a circumstance very unacceptable for Betty said she had orders to let me know that my gardenwalks and poultryvisits were suspected and that both will be prohibited if I stay here till Saturday or Monday  Possibly this is said by order to make me go with less reluctance to my uncle's  My mamma bid her say if I expostulated about these orders and about my pen and ink  'That reading was more to the purpose at present than writeing That by the one I might be taught my duty That the other considering whom I was believed to write to only stiffen'd my will That my needleworks had better be pursued than my airings which were observed to be taken in all weathers'  So my dear if I do not resolve upon something soon I shall neither be able to avoid the intended evil nor have it in my power to correspond with you  Wednesday Night  ALL is in a hurry belowstairs Betty is in and out like a spy Something is working I know not what I am really a good deal disorder'd in body as well as mind Indeed I am quite heartsick  I will go down tho' 'tis almost dark on pretence of getting a little air and composure Robert has my two former I hope before now And I will deposite This with Lovelace's inclosed if I can for fear of another search  I know not what I shall doAll is so strangely busyDoors clapt to Goingout of one apartment hurryingly as I may say into another Betty in her alarming way staring as if of frighted importance  twice with me in half an hour called down in haste by Shorey the last time leaving me with still more meaning in her looks and gesturesYet possibly nothing in all This worthy of my apprehensionsHere again comes the creature with her deepdrawn affected sighs and her  O dear's O dear's  MORE dark hints thrown out by this saucy creature But she will not explain herself  'Suppose this pretty business ends in murder she says I may rue my opposition as long as I live for aught she knows Parents will not be  baffled  out of their children by impudent gentlemen nor is it fit they should It may come home to me when I least expect it'  These are the gloomy and perplexing hints this impertinent throws out Probably they arise from the information Mr Lovelace says he has secretly permitted them to have From his vile doublefaced agent I suppose of his resolution to prevent my being carried to my uncle's  How justly if so may This exasperate themHow am I driven to and fro like a feather in the wind at the pleasure of the rash the selfish and the headstrong and when I am as averse to the proceedings of the one as I am to those of the other But being forced into a clandestine correspondence indiscreet measures are fallen upon by the rash man before I can be consulted And between them I have not an option altho' my ruin For is not the loss of reputation a ruin may be the dreadful consequence of the steps taken What a perverse fate is mine  If I am prevented depositing this and the inclosed as I intend to try to do late as it is I will add to  it as occasion shall offer Mean time believe me to be  Your ever affectionate and grateful CL HARLOWE  Under the superscription written with a pensil after she went down  'My two former not taken awayI am surprisedI hope you are wellI hope All is right betwixt your mamma and you'  LETTER XXXIV Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday Morning April  I Have your three letters Never was there a creature more impatient on the most interesting uncertainty than I was to know the event of the interview between you and Solmes  It behoves me to account to my dear friend in her present unhappy situation for every thing that may have the least appearance of a negligence or remissness on my part I sent Robin in the morning early in hopes of a deposite He loiter'd about the place till near Ten to no purpose and then came away my mamma having given him a letter to carry to Mr Hunt's which he was to deliver before Three when only in the daytime that gentleman is at home and to bring her back an answer to it Mr Hunt's house you know lies wide from HarlowePlaceRobin but just saved his time and return'd not till it was too late to send him again I could only direct him to set out before day this morning and if he got any letter to ride as for his life to bring it to me  I lay by myself A most uneasy night I had thro' impatience and being discomposed with it lay longer than usual Just as I was risen in came Kitty from  Robin with your three letters I was not a quarter dress'd and only slipp'd on my morning sacque proceeding no further till long as they are I had read them all thro' And yet I often stopp'd to rave aloud tho' by myself at the devilish people you have to deal with  How my heart rises at them all How poorly did they design to trick you into an encouragement of Solmes from the interview to which they had extorted your consentI am very very angry at your aunt Hervey To give up her own judgment so tamelyAnd not content with that to become such an  active  instrument in their handsBut it is so like the worldSo like my mamma tooNext to her own child there is not anybody living she values so much as she does youYet it isWhy should we embroil ourselves Nancy with other peoples affairs  Other people  How I hate the poor words where friendship is concern'd and where the protection to be given may be of so much consequence to a friend and of so little detriment to one's self  I am delighted with your spirit however I expected it not from you Nor did They I am sure Nor would  you  perhaps have exerted it if Lovelace's intelligence of Solmes's nurseryoffices had not set you up I wonder not that the wretch is said to love you the better for it What an honour to have such a wife And he can be even with you when you are so He must indeed be a savage as you sayYet is he less to blame for his perseverance than those of your own family whom most you reverence  It is well as I have often said that I have not such provocations and trials I should perhaps long ago have taken your cousin Dolly's adviceYet dare I not to touch that keyI shall always love the good girl for her tenderness to you  I know not what to say to Lovelace nor what to think of his promises nor of his proposals to you  'Tis certain that you are highly esteem'd by all his family The Ladies are persons of unblemishd honour My Lord M is also as Men and Peers go a man of honour I could tell what to advise any other person in the world to do but you So much expected from you Such a shining lightYour quitting your father's house and throwing yourself into the protection of a family however honourable that has a Man in it whose person parts declarations and pretensions will be thought to have engag'd your warmest esteemMethinks I am rather for advising that you should get privately to London and not to let either him or anybody else but me know where you are till your cousin Morden comes  As to going to your uncle's that you must not do if you can help it Nor must you have Solmes that's certain Not only because of his unworthiness in every respect but because of the aversion you have so openly avow'd to him which everybody knows and talks of as they do of your approbation of the other For your reputationsake therefore as well as to prevent mischief you must either live single or have Lovelace  If you think of going to London let me know and I hope you will have  time  to allow me a farther concert as to the manner of your getting away and thither and how to procure proper lodgings for you  To obtain this  time  you must palliate a little and come into some seeming compromise if you cannot do otherwise Driven as you are driven it will be strange if you are not obliged to part with a few of your admirable punctilioes  You will observe from what I have written that I have not succeeded with my mamma  I am extremely mortify'd and disappointed We have had very strong debates upon it But besides the narrow argument of  embroiling ourselves with other peoples affairs  as abovementioned she will have it  that it is your duty to comply She says she was  always  of opinion that daughters  should  and govern'd herself by it for that my papa was at first more her father's choice than her own  This is what she argues in behalf of her favourite Hickman as well as for Solmes in your case  I must not doubt but my mamma always govern'd herself by this principle because she  says  she did I have likewise another reason to believe it which you shall have tho' it may not become me to give itThat they did not live so very happily together as one would hope people might who married preferring each other to the rest of the world  Somebody shall fare never the better for this doublemeant policy of my mamma I will assure him Such a retrospection in her arguments to him and to his address it is but fit that  he  should suffer for  my  mortification in a point I had so much set my heart upon  Think my dear if in any way I can serve you If you allow of it I protest I will go off privately with you and we will live and die together Think of it Improve upon my hint and command me  A little interruption What is breakfast to the subject I am upon  LONDON I am told is the best hidingplace in the world I have written nothing but what I will stand to at the word of command Women love to engage in knighterrantry nowandthen as well as to encourage it in the men But in your case what I propose will have nothing in it of what can be deemed  that  It will enable me to perform what is no more than a duty in serving and comforting a dear and worthy friend labouring under undeserved oppression And you will  ennoble  as I may say your  Anna Howe if you will allow her to be your companion in affliction  I'll engage my dear we shall not be in town together one month before we surmount all difficulties and This without being beholden to any menfellows for their protection  I must repeat what I have often said That the authors of your persecutions would not have presumed to set on foot their selfish schemes against you had they not depended upon the gentleness of your spirit Tho' now having gone so far and having engaged  Old  AUTHORITY in it Chide me if you will neither  he  nor  they  know how to recede  When they find you out of their reach and know that I am with you you'll see how they'll pull in their odious horns  I think however that you should have written to your cousin Morden the moment they had begun to treat you disgracefully  I shall be impatient to hear whether they will attempt to carry you to your uncle's I remember that Lord M's dismissed bailiff reported of Lovelace that he had six or seven companions as bad as himself and that the country was always glad when they left it He  has  such a knot of them now I hear about him And depend upon it he will not suffer them quietly to carry you to your uncle's And whose must you be if he succeeds in taking you from them  I tremble for you but upon supposing what may be the consequences of a conflict upon this occasion To be sure he owes some of them vengeance This gives me a double concern that my mamma should refuse her consent to the protection I had proposed and set my heart upon procuring for you  My mamma will not breakfast without me A quarrel has its conveniencies sometimes Yet too much love I think is as bad as too little  WE have just now had another pull Upon my word she is  excessively  What shall I say  unpersuadeable  I must let her off with that soft word  What old Greek was it that said  He  govern'd Athens his  wife  him and his  son  her  It was not my mamma's fault I am writing to  you  you know that she did not govern my  papa  But I am but a  daughter  Yet I thought I was not quite so powerless when I was set upon carrying a point as I find myself to be  Adieu my dearHappier times must comeAnd that quickly tooThe strings cannot long continue thus overstrained They must break or be relaxed In either way the Certainty must be preferable to the Suspense  One word more  I think in my conscience you must take one of these two alternatives To consent to let us go to London together privately In which case I will procure a vehicle and meet you at your appointment at the stile Lovelace proposes to bring his uncle's chariot to Or dly To put yourself into the protection of Lord M and the Ladies of his family  You have another indeed and that is if you are absolutely resolved against Solmes to meet and marry Lovelace directly  Whichsoever of these you make choice of you'll have This plea both to yourself and to the world that you are concluded by the same uniform principle that has govern'd your whole conduct ever since the contention between Lovelace and your brother has been on foot That is to say that you have chosen a lesser evil in hope to prevent a greater  Adieu and Heaven direct for the best my beloved creature prays  Her ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXXV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Thursday April  I Thank you my dearest friend for the kind pains you have taken in accounting so affectionately for my papers not being taken away yesterday and for the kind protection you would have procured for me if you could  This kind protection was what I wished for But my wishes raised at first by your love were rather govern'd by my despair of other refuge having before cast about and not being able to determine what I  ought  to do and what I  could  do in a situation so unhappy than by a reasonable hope For why indeed should anybody embroil themselves for another when they can avoid it  All my consolation is as I have frequently said that I have not by my own inadvertence or folly brought myself into this sad situation If I  had  I should not have dared to look up to anybody with the expectation of protection or assistance nor to you for excuse of the trouble I give you But nevertheless we should not be angry at a person's not doing that for ourselves or for our friend which she thinks she ought  not  to do and which she has it in her option to  do  or to  let alone  Much less have you a right to be displeased with so prudent a mother for not engaging herself so warmly in my favour as you wish'd she would If my own aunt can give me up and that against her judgment as I may presume to say and if my father and mother and uncles who once loved me so well can join so strenuously against me can  I  expect or ought  you  the protection of your mamma in  opposition  to them  Indeed my dearest love Permit me to be  very  serious  I am afraid I am singled out either for my own faults or for the faults of my family or for the faults of both to be a very unhappy creature  signally  unhappy For see you not how irresistibly the waves of affliction come tumbling down upon me  We have been till within these few weeks everyone of us too happy No crosses no vexations but what we gave ourselves from the  pamperdness  as I may call it of our own wills Surrounded by our heaps and stores hoarded up as fast as acquired we have seemed to think ourselves out of the reach of the bolts of adverse fate I was the pride of all my friends proud  myself  of  their  pride and glorying in my standing who knows what the justice of Heaven may inflict in order to convince us that we are not out of the reach of misfortune and to reduce us to a better reliance than That we have hitherto presumptuously made  I should have been very little the better for the  conversationvisits  which the good Dr Lewin used to honour me with and for the principles  wrought  as I may say into my earliest mind by my pious Mrs Norton founded on her reverend father's experience as well as on her own if I could not thus retrospect and argue in such a strange situation as we are in  Strange  I may well call it for don't you see my dear that we seem all to be  impelled  as it were by a perverse fate which none of us are able to resistAnd yet all arising with a strong appearance of selfpunishment from ourselvesDo not my parents see the hopeful children from whom they expected a perpetuity of worldly happiness to their branching family now grown up to answer the  till  now distant hope setting their angry faces against each other pulling up by the roots as I may say that hope which was ready to be carried into a probable certainty  Your partial love will be ready to acquit me of capital and intentional faultsBut oh my dear my  calamities have humbled me enough to make me turn my gaudy eye inward to make me look into myselfAnd what have I discover'd thereWhy my dear friend more  secret  pride and vanity than I could have thought had lain in my unexamined heart  If  I  am to be singled out to be the  punisher  of myself and family who so lately was the  pride  of it pray for me my dear that I may not be left wholly to myself and that I may be enabled to support my character so as to be  justly  acquitted of wilful and premeditated faults The will of Providence be resigned to in the rest As  that  leads let me patiently and unrepiningly followI shall not live alwaysMay but my  closing  scene be happy  But I will not oppress you my dearest friend with further reflections of this sort I will take them all into myself Surely I have a mind that has room for them My afflictions are too sharp to last long The crisis is at hand Happier times you bid me hope for I  will  hope  BUT yet I cannot but be impatient at times to find myself thus driven and my character so depreciated and sunk that were all the  future  to be happy I should be asham'd to shew my face in public or to look up And all by the instigation of a selfish brother and envious sister  But let me stop Let me reflectAre not these suggestions the suggestions of the  secret  pride I have been censuring Then  already  so impatient But this moment so resigned so much better disposed for reflectionYet 'tis hard 'tis very hard to subdue an embitter'd spiritIn the instant of its trial tooO my cruel brotherBut now it rises againI will lay down a pen I am so little able to governAnd I will try to subdue an impatience which if my afflictions are sent me for corrective ends may otherwise lead me into still more punishable errors  I WILL return to a subject which I cannot fly from for ten minutes togethercalled upon especially as I am by your three alternatives stated in the conclusion of your last  As to the first to wit  Your advice for me to escape to London  Let me tell you that that other hint or proposal which accompanies it perfectly frightens meSurely my dear happy as you are and indulgently treated as your mamma treats you you cannot mean what you propose What a wretch must I be if I could for  one  moment only lend an ear to such proposal as This  I  to be the occasion of making such a mother's perhaps  shorten'd  life unhappy to the last hour of it  Ennoble  you my dear creature How must such an enterprize the rashness  public  the motives were they excusable  private  debase youBut I will not dwell upon the subjectFor your  own  sake I will not  As to your second alternative  To put myself into the protection of Lord M and of the Ladies of that family  I own to you as I believe I have owned before that altho' to do This would be the same thing in the eye of the world as putting myself into Mr Lovelace's protection yet I think I would do it rather than be Mr Solmes's wife if there were evidently no other way to avoid being so  Mr Lovelace you have seen proposes to contrive a way to put me into possession of my own house and he tells me that he will soon fill it with the Ladies of his family as my visitorsupon my invitation however to themA very inconsiderate proposal I think it to be and upon which I cannot explain myself to him What an exertion of independency does it chalk out for me How were I to attend to  him  and not to the natural consequences which the following of his advice would lead me to might I be drawn by  gentle  words into the perpetration of the most  violent  acts  For how could I gain possession but either by legal litigation which were I  inclin'd  to have recourse to it as I never can be must take up time or by forcibly turning out the persons whom my papa has placed there to look after the gardens the house and the furniturepersons intirely attached to himself and who as I know have been lately instructed by my brother  Your third alternative  To meet and marry Lovelace directly  a man with whose morals I am far from being satisfy'dA step that could not be taken with the least hope of ever obtaining pardon from or reconciliation with any of my friendsand against which a thousand objections rise in my mindThat is not to be thought of  What appears to me upon the fullest deliberation the most eligible if I  must  be thus driven is the escaping to LondonBut I would forfeit all my hopes of happiness in this life rather than you should go off with me as you rashly proposeIf I could get safely thither and be private methinks I might remain absolutely independent of Mr Lovelace and at liberty either to make proposals to my friends or should they renounce me and I had no other or better way to make terms with him supposing my cousin Morden on his arrival were to join with them But they would perhaps  then  indulge me in my choice of a single life on giving him up The renewing to them this offer when I was at my own liberty would at least convince them that I was in earnest when I made it first And upon my word I  would  stand to it dear as you seem to think when you are disposed to railly me it would cost me  to  stand to it  If my dear you can procure a conveyance for us  both  you can perhaps procure one for me  singly  But can it be done without embroiling  yourself  with your mamma or  her  with our familyBe it coach chariot chaise waggon or horse I matter not  provided You appear not in it Only in case it be one of the two latter I believe I must desire you to get me an ordinary gown and coat or habit of some servant having no concert with any of our own The more ordinary the better They may be thrust into the woodhouse where I can put them on and then slide down from the bank that separates the woodyard from the green lane  But alas my dear this even  this  alternative is not without difficulties which seem to a spirit so little enterprizing as mine in a manner insuperable These are my reflections upon it  I am afraid in the first place that I shall not have time for the requisite preparations to an escape  Should I be either detected in those preparations or pursued and overtaken in my flight and so brought back then would they think themselves doubly warranted to compel me to have their Solmes And conscious perhaps of an intended fault I should be less able to contend with them  But were I even to get safely to London I know nobody there but by name and those the tradesmen to our family who no doubt would be the first wrote to and engag'd to find me out And should Mr Lovelace discover where I was and he and my brother meet what mischiefs might ensue between them whether I were willing or not to return to HarlowePlace  But supposing I could remain there concealed what might not my youth my sex an unacquaintedness with the ways of that great wicked town expose me toI should hardly dare to go to church for fear of being discover'd People would wonder how I lived Who knows but I might pass for a kept mistress and that altho' nobody came to me yet that everytime I went out it might be imagined to be in pursuance of some assignation  You my dear who alone would know where to  direct to me would be watched in all your steps and in all your messages and your mamma at present not highly pleased with our correspondence would then have reason to be  more  displeased and might not differences follow between you that would make me very unhappy were I to know it And this the more likely as you take it so unaccountably and give me leave to say so ungenerously into your head to revenge yourself upon the innocent Mr Hickman for all the displeasure your mamma gives you  Were Lovelace to find out where I was that would be the same thing in the eye of the world as if I had actually gone off with him For among strangers as I should be he would not be prevailed upon to forbear visiting me And his unhappy character a foolish man is no credit to any young creature desirous of concealment Indeed the world let me escape whither and to whomsoever would conclude  him  to be at the bottom and the contriver of it  These are the difficulties which arise to me on revolving this scheme which situated as I am might appear surmountable to a more enterprising spirit If you my dear think them surmountable in any one of the cases put and to be sure I can take no course but what must have  some  difficulty in it be pleased to let me know your free and full thoughts upon it  Had  you  my dear friend been married then should I have had no doubt but you and Mr Hickman would have afforded an asylum to a poor creature more than half lost in her own apprehension for want of one kind protecting friend  You say I should have written to my cousin Morden the moment I was treated disgracefully But could I have believed that my friends would not have soften'd by degrees when they saw my antipathy to their Solmes  I had thoughts indeed several times of writing to  him But by the time an answer could have come I imagined all would have been over as if it had never beenSo from day to day from week to week I hoped on And after all I might as reasonably fear as I have heretofore said that my cousin would be brought to side against me as that some of those I have named would  And then to appeal to a  cousin  I must have written with  warmth  to engage him against a  father  This was not a desirable thing to set about Then I had not you know one soul of my side my mamma herself against me To be sure he would have suspended his judgment till he could have arrivedHe might not have been in haste to come hoping the malady would cure itself But  had  he written his letters probably would have run in the qualifying style to persuade  me  to submit or  them  only to relax Had his letters been more on  my  side than on  theirs  they would not have regarded them Nor perhaps  himself  had he come and been an advocate for me For you see how strangely determined they are how they have overawed or got in everybody so that no one dare open their lips in my behalf And you have heard that my brother pushes his measures with the more violence that all may be over with me before my cousin's expected arrival  But you tell me That in order to gain time I must  palliate  that I must seem to compromise with my friendsBut how  palliate  how  seem  to compromiseYou would not have me endeavour to make them believe that I will consent to what I never intend to consent toYou would not have me try to gain time with a view to  deceive  To  do evil that good may come of it  is forbidden And shall I do evil yet know not whether good may come of it or not  Forbid it Heaven that Clarissa Harlowe should have it in her thought to  serve  or even to  save  herself  at the expence of her sincerity and by a  studied  deceit  And is there after all no way to escape one great evil but by plunging myself into anotherWhat an illfated creature am IPray for me my dearest NancyMy mind is at present so much disturbed that I hardly can for myself  LETTER XXXVI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Thursday Night  THE alarming hurry I mentioned under my date of last night and Betty's saucy dark hints come out to be owing to what I guess'd they were that is to say to the private intimation Mr Lovelace contrived our family should have of his insolent resolution  insolent  I must call it to prevent my being carried to my uncle's  I saw at the time that it was as  wrong  with respect to answering his own view as it was  insolent  For could he think as Betty I suppose from her betters justly observed That parents would be insulted out of their right to the disposal of their own child by a violent man whom they hate and who could have no pretension to dispute that right with them unless what he had from  her  who had none over herself And how must this insolence of his exasperate them against me emblazon'd as my brother is able to emblazon it  The rash man has indeed so far gained his point as to intimidate them from attempting to carry me away But he has put them upon a surer and a more desperate measure And this has put me also upon one  as  desperate the consequence of which altho' he could not foresee it may perhaps too well answer  his great end little as he deserves to have it answer'd  In short I have done as far as I know the rashest thing that ever I did in my life  But let me give you the motive and then the action will follow of course  About six o' clock this evening my aunt who stays here all night on my account no doubt came up and tapp'd at my door for I was writing and had lock'd myself in I open'd it and she entering thus delivered herself  I come once more to visit you my dear but sorely against my will because it is to impart to you matters of the utmost concern to You and to the whole family  What Madam is now to be done with me said I wholly attentive  You will not be hurried away to your uncle's child let that comfort youThey see your aversion to goYou will not be obliged to go to your uncle Antony's  How you revive me Madam I little thought what was to follow this supposed condescension This is a cordial to my heart  And then I ran over with blessings for this good news and she permitted me so to do by her silence congratulating myself that I  thought  my papa could not resolve to carry things to the last extremity  Hold niece said she at lastYou must not give yourself too much joy upon the occasion neitherDon't be surprised my dearWhy look you upon me child with so affecting an earnestnessBut you must be Mrs Solmes for all that  I was dumb  She then told me that they had had undoubted information that a certain desperate  ruffian  I must excuse her that word she said had prepared armed  men to waylay my brother and uncles and seize me and carry me offSurely she said I was not consenting to a violence that might be followed by murder on one side or the other perhaps on both  I was still silent  That therefore my father still more exasperated than before had changed his resolution as to my going to my uncle's and was determined next Tuesday to set out thither  himself  with my mamma and that for it was to no purpose to conceal a resolution so soon to be put in executionI must not dispute it any longeron Wednesday I must give my handas they would have me  She proceeded That orders were already given for a licence That the ceremony was to be performed in my own chamber in presence of all my friends except of my father and mother who would not return nor see me till all was over and till they had a good account of my behaviour  The very intelligence my dearthe very intelligence This which Lovelace gave me  I was still dumbOnly sighing as if my heart would break  She went on comforting me as she thought She laid before me the merit of obedience and told me that if it were my desire that my Mrs Norton should be present at the ceremony it would be complied with That the pleasure I should receive from reconciling all my friends to me and in their congratulations upon it must needs overbalance with such a one as me the difference of persons however preferable I might think the one man to the other That Love was a fleeting thing little better than a name where morality and virtue did not distinguish the object of it That a choice made by its dictates was seldom happy at least not  durably  so Nor was it to be wonder'd at when it naturally exalted the object above its merits and made the lover blind to  faults that were visible to everybody else So that when a nearer intimacy stript it of its imaginary perfections it left frequently both sides surprized that they could be thus cheated and that then the Indifference became stronger than the Love ever was That a woman gave a man great advantages and inspired him with great vanity when she avowed her love for him and preference of him and was generally requited with insolence and contempt Whereas the confessedlyobliged man it was probable would be all reverence and gratitude and I cannot tell what  You my dear said she believe you shall be unhappy if you have Mr Solmes Your parents think the contrary and that you will be undoubtedly so were you to have Mr Lovelace whose morals are unquestionably badSuppose it were your sad lot to be unhappy with either let me beseech you to consider what great consolation you will have on one hand if you pursue your parents advice that you did so what mortification on the other that by following your own you have nobody to blame but yourself  This you remember my dear was an argument inforced upon me by Mrs Norton  These and other observations which she made were worthy of my aunt Hervey's good sense and experience and applied to almost any young creature who stood in opposition to her parents will but one who had offered to make the sacrifices I have offered to make ought to have had their due weight But altho' it was easy to answer some of them in my own particular case yet having over and over to my mamma  before  my confinement and to my brother and sister and even to my aunt Hervey  since  said what I must now have repeated I was so much mortified and afflicted at the cruel tidings she brought me that however attentive I was to what she said I had neither power nor will to answer one word and  had she not stopp'd of herself she might have gone on an hour longer without interruption from me  Observing this and that I only sat weeping my handkerchief covering my face and my bosom heaving ready to burst What no answer my dearWhy so much  silent  grief You know  I  always loved you You know that  I  have no interest in this affair You would not permit Mr Solmes to acquaint you with some things which would have set your heart against Mr Lovelace Shall I tell you some of the matters charged against him Shall I my dear  Still I answered only by my tears and sighs  Well child you shall be told these things afterwards when you will be in a better state of mind to hear them and to rejoice in the escape you will have had It will be some excuse then for you to plead for your behaviour to Mr Solmes before marriage that you could not have believed Mr Lovelace had been so very vile a man  My heart flutter'd with impatience and anger at being so plainly talked to as the wife of this man but yet I then chose to be silent If I had spoke it would have been with vehemence  Strange my dear such silenceYour concern is infinitely more on this side the day than it will be on the otherBut let me ask you and do not be displeased Will you choose to see what generous stipulations for you there are in the settlementsYou have knowlege beyond your yearsGive the writings a perusal Do my dearThey are ingrossed and ready for signing and have been for some timeExcuse me my loveI mean not to disturb youYour papa would oblige me to bring them up and to leave them with you He commands you to read them  But  to read them niecesince they are ingrossed and were before you made them absolutely hopeless  And then to my great terror out she drew some parchments from her handkerchief which she had kept  unobserved by me under her apron and rising put them in the opposite window Had she produced a serpent I could not have been more frighted  Oh my dearest aunt turning away my face and holding out my hands Hide from my eyes those horrid parchmentsLet me conjure you to tell me By all the tenderness of near relationship and upon your honour and by your love for me say Are they absolutely resolved that come what will I must be That man's  My dear you must have Mr Solmes Indeed you must  Indeed I never will This as I have said over and over is not originally my father's willIndeed I never willAnd that is All I will say  It is your father's will  now  reply'd my aunt And considering how all the family is threatened by Mr Lovelace and the resolution he has certainly taken to force you out of their hands I cannot but say they are in the right not to be bullied out of their child  Well Madam then nothing remains for me to say I am made desperate I care not what becomes of me  Your piety and your prudence my dear and Mr Lovelace's immoral character together with his dareing insults and threatenings which ought to incense  you  as much as anybody are every one's dependence We are sure the time will come when you'll think very differently of the steps your friends take to disappoint a man who has made himself so justly obnoxious to them all  She withdrew leaving me full of grief and indignationAnd as much out of humour with Mr Lovelace as with anybody who by his conceited contrivances has made things worse for me than before depriving me of the hopes I had of gaining time to receive your advice and private assistance to get to town and leaving me no other choice in all  appearance than either to throw myself upon his family or to be made miserable for ever with Mr Solmes But I was still resolved to avoid both these evils if possible  I sounded Betty in the first place whom my aunt sent up not thinking it proper as Betty told me that I should be left by myself and who I found knew their designs whether it were not probable that they would forbear at my earnest entreaty to push matters to the threatened extremity  But she confirmed all my aunt said rejoicing as she said they All did that the wretch had given them so good a pretence to save me from him now and for ever  She run on about equipages bespoke talked of my brother's and sister's exultations that now the whole family would soon be reconciled to each other Of the servants joy upon it Of the expected licence Of a visit to be paid me by Dr Lewin or another Clergyman whom they named not to  her  which was to crown the work And of other preparations so particular as made me dread that they designed to surprize me into a still nearer day than next Wednesday  These things made me excessively uneasy I knew not what to resolve upon  At one time thought I what have I to do but to throw myself at once into the protection of Lady Betty Lawrance But then in resentment of his  fine  contrivances which had so abominably disconcerted me I soon resolved to the contrary And at last concluded to ask the favour of another halfhour's conversation with my aunt  I sent Betty to her with my request  She came  I put it to her in the most earnest manner to tell me whether I might not obtain the favour of a fortnight's respite  She assured me It would not be granted  Would a week Surely a week would  She believ'd a week might if I would promise two things The first upon my honour not to write a line out of the house in that week For it was still suspected she said that I found means to write to  somebody  And secondly to marry Mr Solmes at the expiration of it  Impossible Impossible I said with passionWhat might I not be obliged with one week without such a horrid condition at the last  She would go down she said that she might not seem of her own head to put upon me what I thought a hardship so great  She went down And came up again  Did I want was the answer to give the vilest of men opportunity to put his murderous schemes in executionIt was time for them to put an end to my obstinacy they were tired out with me and to his hopes at once And an end  should  be put on Tuesday or Wednesday next at furthest unless I would give my honour to comply with the condition upon which my aunt had been  so good  as to allow me a longer time  I even stamp'd with impatienceI called upon her to witness that I was guiltless of the consequence of this compulsion This barbarous compulsion I called it let that consequence be what it would  My aunt chid me in an higher strain than ever she did before  While I in a half frenzy insisted upon seeing my Papa Such usage I said set me above fear I would rejoice to owe my death to him as I did my life  She own'd that she fear'd for my head  I did go down half way of the stairs resolved to throw myself at his feet whereever he wasMy  aunt was frightedIndeed I was quite frenzical for a few minutesBut hearing my brother's voice as talking to somebody in my sister's apartment just by I stopped and heard the barbarous designer say speaking to my sister This works charmingly my dear sister  It does It does said she in an exulting accent  Let us keep it up said my brotherThe villain is caught in his own trapNow she must be what we'd have her be  Do You keep my father to it I'll take care of my mamma said Bella  Never fear said heAnd a laugh of congratulation to each other and derision of me as I made it out quite turned my frenzical humour into a vindictive one  My aunt just then coming down to me and takeing my hand led me up and try'd to sooth me  My raving was turned into sullenness  She preached patience and obedience to me  I was silent  At last she desired me to assure her that I would offer no violence to myself  God I said had given me more grace I hoped than to be guilty of so horrid a rashness I was His creature and not  my own    She then took leave of me and I insisted upon her taking down with her the odious parchments  Seeing me in so ill an humour and very earnest that she should take them with her she did but said That my papa should not know that she did And hoped I would better consider of the matter and be calmer next time they were offer'd to my perusal  I revolved after she was gone all that my brother and sister had said I dwelt upon their triumphings over me And found rise in my mind a rancour that I think I may say was new to me and which I could  not withstandAnd putting every thing together dreading the near day what could I doAm I in any manner excusable for what I  did  doIf I am condemned by the world who know not my provocations may I be acquitted by youIf  not  I am unhappy indeedFor This I did  Having shook off Betty as soon as I could I wrote to Mr Lovelace to let him know  'That all that was threatened at my uncle Antony's was intended to be executed  here  That I had come to a resolution to throw myself upon the protection of either of his two aunts who would afford it me In short that by endeavouring to obtain leave on Monday to dine in the ivysummerhouse I would if possible meet him without the gardendoor at two three four or five o'Clock on Monday afternoon as I should be able That in the mean time he should acquaint me whether I might hope for either of those Ladies protectionAnd if so I absolutely insisted that he should leave me with either and go to London himself or remain at his uncle's nor offer to visit me till I were satisfied that nothing could be done with my friends in an amicable way and that I could not obtain possession of my own estate and leave to live upon it And particularly that he should not hint marriage to me till I consented to hear him upon that subjectI added that if he could prevail upon one of the Misses Montague to favour me with her company on the road it would make me abundantly easier in an enterprize which I could not think of altho' so driven without the utmost concern and which would throw such a flur upon my reputation in the eye of the world as perhaps I should never be able to wipe off'  This was the purport of what I wrote and down into the garden I slid with it in the dark which at another time I should not have had the courage to  do and deposited it and came up again unknown to anybody  My mind so dreadfully misgave me when I returned that to divert in some measure my increasing uneasiness I had recourse to my private pen and in a very short time ran this length  And now that I am come to this part my uneasy reflections begin again to pour in upon me Yet what can I doI believe I shall take it back again the first thing I do in the morningYet what  can  I do  For fear they should have an earlier day in their intention than that which will too soon come I will begin to be very ill Nor need I feign much for indeed I am extremely low weak and faint  I hope to deposite this early in the morning for you as I shall return from resuming my letter if I do resume it as my  inwardest  mind bids me  Altho' it is now near Two o'clock I have a good mind to slide down once more in order to take back my letter Our doors are always locked and barred up at a eleven but the seats of the lesser hall windows being almost even with the ground without and the shutters not difficult to open I could easily get out  Yet why should I be thus uneasySince should the letter go I can but hear what Mr Lovelace says to it His aunts live at too great a distance for him to have an immediate answer from them so I can scruple going off till I have invitation I can  insist  upon one of his cousins meeting me as I have hinted in the chariot and he may not be able to obtain that favour from either of them Twenty things may happen to afford me a suspension at least Why should I be so very uneasyWhen too I can resume it early before it is probable he will have the thought of finding it there Yet he owns he spends three parts of his days and has done for this fortnight past in loitering about in one disguise or other besides  the attendance given by his trusty servant when he himself is not  in waiting  as he calls it  But these strange forebodingsYet I can if you advise cause the chariot he shall bring with him to carry me directly for town whither in my London scheme if you were to approve it I had proposed to go And This will save you the trouble of procuring for me a vehicle as well as the suspicion from your mamma of contributing to my escape  But sollicitous for your advice and approbation too if I  can  have it I will put an end to this letter  Adieu my dearest friend adieu  LETTER XXXVII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Friday Morning Seven o'Clock April  MY aunt Hervey who is a very early riser was walking in the garden Betty attending her as I saw from my window this morning when I arose for after such a train of fatigue and restless nights I had unhappily overslept myself So all I durst venture upon was to step down to my poultryyard and deposite mine of yesterday and last night And I am just come up for she is still in the garden This prevents me from going to resume my letter as I think still to do and hope it will not be too late  I said I had unhappily overslept myself I went to bed at about half an hour after Two I told the quarters till Five after which I dropt asleep and awaked not till past Six and then in great terror from a dream which has made such an impression upon me that slightly as I think of dreams I cannot help taking this opportunity to relate it to you  'Methought my brother my uncle Antony and Mr Solmes had formed a plot to destroy Mr  Lovelace who discovering it turned all his rage against me believing I had a hand in it I thought he made them all fly into foreign parts upon it and afterwards seizing upon me carried me into a churchyard and there notwithstanding all my prayers and tears and protestations of innocence stabbed me to the heart and then tumbled me into a deep grave ready dug among two or three halfdissolved carcases throwing in the dirt and earth upon me with his hands and trampling it down with his feet'  I awoke with the terror all in a cold sweat trembling and in agonies and still the frightful images raised by it remain upon my memory  But why should I who have such  real  evils to contend with regard  imaginary  ones This no doubt was owing to my disturbed imagination huddling together wildly all the frightful ideas which my aunt's communications and discourse my letter to Mr Lovelace my own uneasiness upon it and the apprehensions of the dreaded Wednesday furnished me with  Eight o'Clock  THE man my dear has got the letterWhat a strange diligence I wish he mean me well that he takes so much painsYet must own that I should be displeased if he took lessI wish however he had been an hundred miles offWhat an advantage have I given him over me  Now the letter is out of my power I have more uneasiness and regret than I had before For till now I had a doubt whether it should or should not go And now I think it ought  not  to have gone And yet is there anyother way than to do as I have done if I would avoid Solmes But what a giddy creature shall I be thought if I pursue the cuurse to which this letter must lead me  My dearest friend tell me have I done wrongYet do not  say  I have if you  think  it for should all the world besides condemn me I shall have some comfort if  you  do not The first time I ever besought you to flatter me That of itself is an indication that I have done wrong and am afraid of hearing the truthO tell me but yet do not tell me if I have done wrong  Friday Eleven o'Clock  MY aunt has made me another visit She began what she had to say with letting me know That my friends are all persuaded that I still correspond with Mr Lovelace as is plain she said by hints and menaces he throws out which shews that he is apprized of several things that have passed between my relations and me sometimes within a very little while after they have happened  Altho' I approve not of the method he stoops to take to come at his intelligence yet is it not prudent in me to clear myself by the ruin of the corrupted servant as his vileness has neither my connivance nor approbation since my doing so might occasion the detection of my own correspondence and so frustrate all the hopes I have to avoid this Solmes Yet it is not at all unlikely that this very agent of Mr Lovelace plays booty between my brother and him How else can  our family  know so  soon  too his menaces upon the passages they hint at  I assured my aunt that I was too much ashamed of the treatment I met with for everyone's sake as well as for my own to acquaint Mr Lovelace with the particulars of it were the means of corresponding with him afforded me That I had reason to think that if he were to know of it from me we must be upon such terms that he would not scruple making some visits which would give me great apprehensions They all knew I said that I had no communication  with any of my papa's servants except my sister's Betty Barnes For altho' I had a good opinion of them all and believed if left to their own inclinations they would be glad to serve me yet finding by their shy behaviour that they were under particular direction I had forborne ever since my Hannah had been so disgracefully dismissed so much as to speak to any of them for fear I should be the occasion of their losing their places too They must therefore account among  themselves  for the intelligence Mr Lovelace met with since neither my brother nor sister as Betty had frequently in praise of their sincerity informed me nor perhaps their favourite Mr Solmes were at all careful who they spoke before when they had any thing to throw out against him or even against  me  whom they took great pride to join with him on this occasion  It was but too natural my aunt said for my friends to suppose that he had his intelligence part of it at least from me who thinking myself hardly treated might complain of it if not to him to Miss Howe which perhaps might be the same thing for they knew Miss Howe spoke as freely of them as they could do of Mr Lovelace and must have the particulars she spoke of from somebody who knew what was done here That this determined my papa to bring the whole matter to a speedy issue lest fatal consequences should ensue  I perceive you are going to speak with warmth proceeded she And so I wasFor my own part I am sure you would not write any thing if you  do  write to inflame so violent a spiritBut this is not the end of my present visit  You cannot my dear but be convinced that your father  will  be  obeyed  The more you contend against his will the more he thinks himself obliged to assert his authority Your mamma desires me to tell you that if you will give her the least hopes of  a dutiful compliance she will be willing to see you in her closet just now while your papa is gone to take a walk in the garden  Astonishing persistence said II am tired with making declarations and pleadings on this subject and had hoped that my resolution being so well known I should not have been further urged upon it  You mistake the purport of my present visit Miss looking gravely Heretofore you have been  desired  and  prayed  to obey and oblige your friends  Intreaty  is at an end They give it up Now it is  resolved upon  that your father's will  is to be obeyed  as it is fit it should Some things are laid at your door as if you concurred with Lovelace's threatened violence to carry you off which your mamma will not believe She will tell you her own good opinion of you She will tell you how much she still loves you And what she expects of you on the approaching occasion But yet that she may not be exposed to an opposition which would the more provoke her she desires you will first assure her that you go down with a resolution to do that with a grace which must be done with or without a grace And besides she wants to give you some advice how to proceed in order to reconcile yourself to your papa and to everybody else Will you go down Miss or will you not  I said I should think myself happy could I be admitted to my mamma's presence after so long a banishment from it but that I could not wish it upon those terms  And This is your answer Miss  It must be my answer Madam Come what may I never will have Mr Solmes I am very much concerned that this matter is so often press'd upon meI never will have that man  Down she went with displeasure I could not help it I was quite tired with so many attempts all to  the same purpose I am amazed that They are notSo little variation And no concession on either side  I will go down and deposite this for Betty has seen I have been writing The saucy creature took a napkin and dipt it in water and with a fleering air Here Miss holding the wet corner to me  What's That for said I  Only Miss one of the fingers of your righthand if you please to look at it  It was inky  I gave her a look but said nothing  But lest I should have another search I will close here  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XXXVIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Friday One o'Clock  I Have a letter from Mr Lovelace full of transports vows and promises I will send it to you inclosed You'll see how he engages in it for his aunt Lawrance's protection and for Miss Charlotte Montague's accompanying me  'I have nothing to do but to persevere he says and prepare to receive the personal congratulations of his whole family'  But you'll see how he presumes upon my being  his  as the consequence of throwing myself into that Lady's protection  The chariotandfix is to be ready at the place he mentions You'll see as to the slur upon my reputation which I am so apprehensive about how boldly he argues Generously enough indeed were I to be  his  and had given him reason to believe that I wouldBut that I have not done  How one step brings on another with this incroaching  Sex How soon may a young creature who gives a man the least encouragement be carried beyond her intentions and out of her own powerYou would imagine by what he writes that I have given him reason to think that my aversion to Mr Solmes is all owing to my favour for him  The dreadful thing is that comparing what he writes from his intelligencer of what is designed against me though he seems not to know the threatened day with what my aunt and Betty assure me of there can be no hope for me but that I must be Solmes's wife if I stay here  I had better have gone to my uncle Antony's at this rate I should have gained time at least by it This is the fruit of his fine contrivances  'What we are to do and how good he is to be How I am to direct all his future steps'  All this shews as I said before that he is sure of me  However I have reply'd to the following effect  'That although I had given him room to expect that I would put myself into his aunt's protection yet as I have three days to come between this and Monday and as I hope that my friends will still relent or that Mr Solmes will give up a point they will both find it impossible to carry I shall not look upon myself as absolutely bound by the appointment And expect therefore if I recede that I shall not be called to account for it by him That I think it necessary to acquaint him that if by putting myself into Lady Betty Lawrance's protection he understands that I mean directly to throw myself into  his  power he is very much mistaken For that there are many points in which I must be satisfied several matters to be adjusted even after I have left this house if I do leave it before I can think of giving him any particular encouragement That in the first place he must expect that I will do my utmost to procure my father's reconciliation and  approbation of my future steps and that I will govern myself intirely by his commands in every reasonable point as much as if I had not left his house That if he imagines that I shall not reserve to myself this liberty but that my withdrawing is to give him any advantages which he would otherwise have had I am determined to tarry where I am and abide the event in hopes that my friends will still accept of my reiterated promise never to marry him or anybody else without their consent'  This I will deposite as soon as I can And as he thinks things are near their crisis I dare say it will not be long before I have an answer to it  Friday Four o'Clock  I AM far from being well Yet must I make myself worse than I am preparative to the suspension I hope to obtain of the menaced evil of Wednesday next And if I do obtain it I will postpone my appointment to meet Mr Lovelace  Betty has told them I am very much indisposed But I have no pity from anybody  I believe I am become the object of everyone's aversion and that they would all be glad I were deadIndeed I believe it  'What ails the perverse creature'  cries one  'Is she lovesick'  another  I was in the Ivysummerhouse and came out shivering with cold as if aguishly seized Betty observed this and reported it  'O no matterLet her shiver onCold cannot hurt her Obstinacy will defend her from That Perverseness is a Bracer to a lovesick girl and more effectual than the Cold Bath to make hardy altho' the constitution be ever so tender'  This said by a cruel brother and heard said by the dearer friends of one for whom but a few months  ago everybody was apprehensive at every blast of wind to which she exposed herself  Betty it must be owned has an admirable memory on these occasions Nothing of this nature is lost by her repetition Even the very air she repeats with renders it unnecessary to ask Who said This or That severe thing  Friday Six o'Clock  MY aunt who again stays all night has just left me She came to tell me the result of my friends deliberations about me It is this  Next Wednesday morning they are all to be assembled To wit my father mother my uncles herself and my uncle Hervey my brother and sister of course my good Mrs Norton is likewise to be admitted And Dr Lewin is to be at hand to exhort me it seems if there be occasion But my aunt is not certain whether he is to be among them or to tarry till called in  When this awful court is set the poor prisoner is to be brought in supported by Mrs Norton who is to be first tutored to instruct me in the duty of a child which it seems I have quite forgotten  Nor is the success at all doubted my aunt says For it is not believed I can be so harden'd as to withstand so venerable a judicature altho' I have withstood several of them separately And still the less as she hints at extraordinary condescensions from my papa But what condescensions from even my father can induce me to make such a sacrifice as is expected from me  Yet my spirits will never bear up I doubt at such a tribunal My father presiding in it  I believed indeed that my trials would not be at an end till he had admitted me once more into his awful presence  What is hoped from me she says is That I  will chearfully on Tuesday night if not before sign the articles and so turn the succeeding day's solemn convention of all my friends into a day of festivity I am to have the licence sent me up however and once more the settlements that I may see how much in earnest they are  She further hinted that my papa himself would bring up the settlements for me to sign  O my dear what a trial will This beHow shall I be able to refuse to my father My father from whose presence I have been so long banish'd he commanding and intreating perhaps in a breath How shall I be able to refuse to my father the writing of my name  They are sure she says something is working on Mr Lovelace's part and perhaps on mine And my papa would sooner follow me to the grave than see me  his  wife  I said I was not well That the very apprehensions of these trials were already insupportable to me and would increase upon me as the time approached and I was afraid I should be extremely ill  They had prepared themselves for such an  artifice  as That was my aunt's unkind word and she could assure me it would stand me in no stead  Artifice  repeated I And this from my aunt Hervey  Why my dear said she do you think people are foolsCan they not see how dismally you endeavour to sigh yourself down withindoorsHow you hang down your  sweet face  those were the words she was pleased to use upon your bosomHow you totter as it were and hold by this chair and by that doorpost when you know that Anybody sees you This my dear Miss Howe is an aspersion to fasten hypocrisy and contempt upon me My brother's or sister's aspersionI am not capable of arts  so low But the moment you are down with your poultry or advancing upon your gardenwalk and as you imagine out of everybody's sight it is seen how nimbly you trip along and what an alertness governs all your motions  I should hate myself said I were I capable of such poor  artifices  as these I must be a fool to use them as well as a mean creature for have I not had experience enough that my friends are incapable of being moved in much more  affecting instances  But you'll see how I shall be by Tuesday  My dear you will not offer any violence to your healthI hope God has given you more grace than to do that  I hope he has Madam But there is violence enough offer'd and threatened to affect my health and that will be found without my needing to have recourse to any other or to  artifice  either  I'll only tell you one thing my dear And that is Ill or well the ceremony will probably be performed before WednesdaynightBut This also I will tell you altho' beyond my present commission that Mr Solmes will be under an engagement if you should require it of him as a favour after the ceremony is passed and Lovelace's hopes thereby utterly extinguished to leave you at your father's and return to his own house every evening until you are brought to a full sense of your duty and consent to acknowlege your change of name  There was no opening of my lips to such a speech as This I was dumb  And these my dear Miss Howe are They who  some  of them at least have called me a romantic girlThis is my chimerical brother and wis  sister both joining their heads together I dare say▪ And yet my aunt told me that the last part wa  what took in my mamma who had till that wa  started insisted that her child should not be married  if thro' grief or opposition she should be ill or fall into fits  This intended violence my aunt often excused by the certain information they pretended to have of some plots or machinations that were ready to break out from Mr Lovelace  It may not be amiss to observe in this place That Mr Lovelace artfully contrived to drive them on by permitting  his  agent and  theirs  to report machinations which he had no intention nor power to execute  The effects of which were thus cunningly to be frustrated  Friday Nine o'Clock  AND now my dear what shall I conclude upon You see how determin'dBut how can I expect your advice will come time enough to stand me in any stead For here I have been down and already have another letter from Mr Lovelace The man lives upon the spot I think And I must write to him either that I will or will not stand to my first resolution of escaping hence on Monday next If I let him know that I will not appearances so strong  against  him and  for  Solmes even stronger than when I made the appointment will it not be justly deemed my own fault if I am compelled to marry their odious man And if any mischief ensue from Mr Lovelace's rage and disappointment will it not lie at my doorYet he offers so fairYet on the other hand to incur the censure of the world as a giddy creatureBut that as he hints I have already incurredWhat can I do Oh that my cousin MordenBut what signifies wishing  I will here give you the substance of Mr Lovelace's letter The letter itself I will send when I have answered it but that I will defer doing as long as I can in hopes of finding reason to retract an appointment on which so much depends And yet it is necessary you should have all before you as I go  along that you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis of my fate  'He begs my pardon for writing with so much assurance attributing it to his unbounded transport and intirely acquiesces in my will He is full of alternatives and proposals He offers to attend me directly to Lady Betty's or if I had rather to my own estate and that my Lord M shall protect me there He knows not my dear my reasons for rejecting this inconsiderate advice In either case as soon as he sees me safe he will go up to London or whither I please and not come near me but by my own permission and till I am satisfy'd in every thing I am doubtful of as well with regard to his reformation as to settlements c  'To conduct me to You my dear is another of his alternatives not doubting he says but your mamma will receive me Or if That be not agreeable to you to your mamma or to me he will put me into Mr Hickman's protection whom no doubt Miss Howe can influence and that it may be given out that I am gone to Bath or Bristol or Abroad whereever I please  'Again If it be more agreeable he proposes to attend me privately to London where he will procure handsome lodgings for me and both his cousins Montague to receive me there and to accompany me till all shall be adjusted to my mind and till a reconciliation shall be effected which he assures me nothing shall be wanting in him to facilitate greatly as he has been insulted by all my family  'These several measures he proposes to my choice it being unlikely he says that he can procure in the time a letter from Lady Betty under her own hand inviting me in form to her house unless he had been himself to go to that Lady for it which at this critical conjuncture while he is attending my commands is impossible  'He conjures me in the solemnest manner if I would not throw him into utter despair to keep to my appoinment  'However instead of threatening my relations or Solmes if I recede he respectfully says that he doubts not but that if I do it will be upon such reasons as he ought to be satisfy'd with upon no slighter he hopes than their leaving me at full liberty to pursue my own inclinations In which whatever they shall be he will intirely acquiesce only endeavouring to make his future good behaviour the sole ground for his expectation of my favour  'In short he solemnly vows that his  whole  view at present is To free me from my imprisonment and to restore me to my own freewill in a point so absolutely necessary to my future happiness He declares that neither the hopes he has in my future favour nor the honour of himself and family will permit him to propose any thing that shall be inconsistent with my own most scrupulous notions And for my mind's sake should choose to have this end obtained by my friends declining to compel me But that nevertheless as to the world's opinion it is impossible to imagine that the behaviour of my relations to me has not already brought upon my family those free censures which they deserve and caused the step which I am so scrupulous about taking to be no other than the natural and expected consequence of their treatment of me'  Indeed I am afraid all this is true And it is owing to some little degree of politeness that Mr Lovelace does not say all he might say on this subject For I have no doubt that I am the talk and perhaps the byword of half the county If so I am afraid I can now do nothing that will give me more disgrace than I have already so causelesly received by their indiscreet persecutions And let me be whose I will and do what I will I shall never wipe off the stain my confinement  and the rigorous usage I have received have fixed upon me at least in my own opinion  I wish if ever I am to be considered as one of the eminent family this man is ally'd to some of them do not think the worse of me for the disgrace I have receivedIn that case perhaps I shall be obliged to him if  he  do not You see how much this harsh this cruel treatment from my own family has humbled meBut perhaps I was too much exalted before  Mr Lovelace concludes  'with repeatedly begging an interview with me and That  this  night if possible An honour he says he is the more encouraged to solicit for as I had twice before made him hope for it But whether he obtain it or not he beseeches me to choose one of the alternatives he offers to my acceptance and not to depart from my resolution of escaping on Monday unless the reason ceases on which I had taken it up and that I have a prospect of being restored to my friends favour at least to my own liberty and freedom of choice'  He renews all his vows and promises on this head in so earnest and so solemn a manner that his own interest and his family's honour and their favour for me cooperating I can have no room to doubt of his sincerity  LETTER XXXIX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sat Morn o' Clock April  WHether you will blame me or not I cannot tell But I have deposited a letter confirming my former resolution to leave this house on Monday next within the hours if possible prefixed in my former I have not kept a copy of it But this is the substance  I tell him  'That I have no way to avoid the determin'd resolution of my friends in behalf of Mr Solmes but by abandoning this house by his assistance'  I have not pretended to make a merit with him on this score for I plainly tell him  'That could I without an unpardonable sin the when I  would  I would sooner make death my choice than take a step which all the world if not my own heart will condemn me for taking'  I tell him  'That I shall not try to bring any other cloaths with me than those I shall have on and those but my common wearingapparel lest I should be suspected That I must expect to be deny'd the possession of my estate But that I am determin'd never to consent to a litigation with my father were I to be reduced to ever so low a state So that the protection I am to be obliged for to any one must be alone for the distresssake And yet that I have too much pride to think of marrying until I have a fortune that shall make me appear upon a foot of equality with and void of obligation to anybody That therefore he will have nothing to hope for from this step that he had not before And that in every light I reserve to myself to accept or refuse his address as his behaviour and cir+cumspection shall appear to me to deserve'  I tell him  'That I think it best to go into a pri+vate lodging in the neighbourhood of his aunt Lawrance and not to her house that it may not appear to the world that I have refuged myself in his family and that a reconciliation with my friends may not on that account be made impracticable That I will send for thither my faithful Hannah and apprize only Miss Howe where I am That he shall instantly leave me and go to London or to one of his uncle's seats and as he had promised  not come near me but by my leave contenting himself with a correspondence by letter only  'That if I find myself in danger of being discovered and carried back by violence I will then throw myself directly into the protection of either of his aunts who will receive me But This only in case of absolute necessity for that it will be more to my reputation for me by the best means I can taking advantage of my privacy to enter by a second or third hand into a treaty of reconciliation with my friends  'That I must however plainly tell him That if in this treaty my friends insist upon my resolveing against marrying him I will engage to comply with them provided they will allow me to promise him that I will never be any other man's while he remains single or is living That this is a compliment I am willing to pay to him in return for the trouble and pains he has taken and the usage he has met with on my account Altho' I intimate that he may in a great measure thank himself and the little regard he has paid to his reputation for the slights he has met with'  I tell him  'That I may in this privacy write to my cousin Morden and if possible interest him in my cause  'I take some brief notice of his alternatives'  You must think my dear that this unhappy force upon me and this projected flight makes it necessary for me to account to him much sooner than it agrees with my stomach to do for every part of my conduct  'It is not to be expected I tell him that your mamma will embroil herself or suffer you or Mr Hickman to be embroiled on my account And as to his proposal of my going to London I am such an absolute stranger to everybody there and have  such a bad opinion of the place that I cannot by any means think of going thither except I should be induced some time hence by the Ladies of his family to attend them  'As to the meeting he is desirous of I think it by no means proper especially as it is so likely that I may soon see him But that if any thing occurs to induce me to change my mind as to withdrawing I may then very probably take the first opportunity to see him and give him my reasons for that change'  This my dear I the less scrupled to write that I might qualify him for such a disappointment should I give it he having besides behaved so very unexceptionably when he surprized me some time ago in the lonely woodhouse  Finally  'I commend myself as a person in distress and merely as such to  his  honour and to his  aunt  's protection I repeat most cordially I am sure my deep concern for being forced to take a step so disagreeable and so derogatory to my honour And having told him that I will endeavour to obtain leave to dine in the Ivy summerhouse  The  Ivy summerhouse  or  Ivy bower  as it was sometimes called in the family was a place that from a girl this young Lady delighted in She used in the summermonths frequently to sit and work and read and write and draw and when permitted to breakfast and dine and sometimes to sup in it especially when Miss Howe who had an equal liking to it was her visitor and guest  She describes it in another letter as  'angularly pointing to a pretty variegated landschape of wood water and hilly country which had pleased her so much that she had drawn it the piece hanging up in her parlour among some of her other drawings'  and to send Betty of some errand when there I leave the rest to him but imagine that about four o' clock will be a proper time for him to contrive some signal to let me know he is at hand and for me to unbolt the gardendoor'  I added by way of postscript  'That their suspicions  seeming to increase I advise him to contrive to send or come to the usual place as frequently as possible in the interval of time till Monday morning ten or eleven o' clock as something may possibly happen to make me alter my mind'  O my dear Miss Howewhat a sad sad thing is the necessity forced upon me for all this preparation and contrivanceBut it is now too lateBut how  Too late  did I sayWhat a word is  that  what a dreadful thing  were  I to repent to  find  it to be too late to remedy the apprehended evil  Saturday Ten o' Clock  Mr Solmes is here He is to dine with his new relations as Betty tells me he already calls them  He would have thrown himself in my way once more But I hurry'd up to my prison in my return from my gardenwalk to avoid him  I had when in the garden the curiosity to see if my letter were gone I cannot say with an intention to take it back again if it had not because I see not how I could do otherwise than I have done Yet what a caprice was thisFor when I found it gone I began as yesterdaymorning to wish it had not For no other reason I believe than because it was out of my power  A strange diligence in this manHe  says  he almost lives upon the place and I think so too  He mentions as you will see in his letter four several disguises which he put on in one day It is a wonder nevertheless that he has not been seen by some of our tenants For it is impossible that any disguise can hide the gracefulness of his figure But this is to be said that the adjoining grounds being all in our own hands and no common footpaths near that part of the garden and thro' the park and coppice nothing can be more bye and unfrequented  Then they are less watchful I believe over my  gardenwalks and my poultryvisits depending as my aunt hinted upon the bad character they have taken so much pains to fasten upon Mr Lovelace This they think and justly think must fill me with doubts And then the regard I have hitherto had for my reputation is another of their securities Were it not for these two they would not surely have used me as they have done and at the same time left me the opportunities which I have several times had to get away had I been disposed to do so  They might no doubt make a dependence upon the reasons she gives But their chief reliance was upon the vigilance of their Joseph Leman little imagining what an implement he was of Mr Lovelace  And indeed their dependencies on both these motives would have been well founded had they kept but tolerable measures with me  Then perhaps they have no notion of the backdoor as it is seldom open'd and leads to a place so pathless and lonesome  This in another of her letters is thus described  'A piece of ruins upon it the remains of an old chapel now standing in the midst of the coppice here and there an overgrown oak surrounded with ivy and misletoe starting up to sanctify as it were the awful solemness of the place A spot too where a man having been found hanging some years ago it was used to be thought of by us when children and by the maidservants with a degree of terror as the habitation of owls ravens and other ominous birds and as haunted by ghosts goblins spectres The genuine result of country loneliness and ignorance Notions which early propagated are apt to leave impressions even upon minds grown strong enough at the same time to despise the like credulous follies in others'  If not there  can  be no other way to go off if one would without discovery unless by the plashy lane so full of springs by which your servant reaches the solitary woodhouse to which lane one must descend from a high bank that bounds the poultryyard For as to the frontway you know one must pass thro' the house to That and in sight of the parlours and the servants hall then have the large open courtyard to go through and by means of the irongate be full in view as one passes  over the lawn for a quarter of a mile together the young plantations of elms and limes affording yet but little shade or covert  The Ivy summerhouse is the most convenient for this affecting purpose of any spot in the garden as it is not far from the backdoor and yet in another alley as you may remember Then it is seldom resorted to by anybody else except in the summermonths because it is cool When they loved me they would often for this reason object to my long continuance in itBut now it is no matter what becomes of me Besides  cold is a bracer  as my brother said yesterday  Here I will deposite what I have written Let me have your prayers my dear and your approbation or your censure of the steps I have taken For yet it may not be quite too late to revoke the appointment I am  Your most affectionate and faithful CL HARLOWE  Why will you send your servant emptyhanded  LETTER XL Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Sat Afternoon  BY your last date of Ten in your letter of this day you could not long have deposited it before Robin took it He rode hard and brought it to me just as I had risen from table  You may justly blame me for sending my messenger emptyhanded your situation consider'd and yet that very situation so critical is partly the reason for it For indeed I knew not what to write fit to send you  I had been inquiring privately how to procure you a conveyance from HarlowePlace and yet not appear in it knowing that to oblige in the  fact  and  to disoblige in the  manner  is but obliging by halves My mamma being moreover very suspicious and very uneasy made more so by daily visits from your uncle Antony who tells her that now everything is upon the point of being determined and hopes that her daughter will not so interfere as to discourage your compliance with their wills This I came at by a way that I cannot take notice of or  both  should hear of it in a manner  neither  would like And  without  that my mamma and I have had almost hourly bickerings  I found more difficulty than I expected as the time was confined and secresy required in procuring you a vehicle and as you so earnestly forbid me to accompany you in your enterprize Had you not obliged me to keep measures with my mamma I could have managed it with ease I could even have taken our own chariot on one pretence or other and put two horses extraordinary to it if I had thought fit and I could have sent it back from London and nobody the wiser as to the lodgings we might have taken  I wish to the Lord you had permitted This Indeed I think you are two punctilious a great deal for your situation Would you expect to enjoy yourself with your usual placidness and not be ruffled in an hurricane which every moment threatens to blow your house down  Had your distress sprung from yourself that would have been another thing But when all the world knows where to lay the fault this alters the case  How can you say I am happy when my mamma to her power is as much an abettor of their wickedness to my dearest friend as your aunt or anybody elseAnd this thro' the instigation of that oddheaded and foolish uncle of yours who sorry creature that he is keeps her up to resolutions which are unworthy of her for an example to me and please you  Is not this cause enough for me to ground a resentment upon sufficient to justify me for accompanying you the friendship between us so well known  Indeed my dear the importance of the case consider'd I must repeat That you are too nice Don't they already think that your standingout is owing a good deal to my advice Have they not prohibited our correspondence upon that very surmize And have I but on  your  account reason to value  what  they think  Besides what discredit have I to fear by such a step What detriment Would Hickman do you believe refuse me upon itIf he did should I be sorry for thatWho is it that has a Soul who would not be affected by such an instance of female friendship  But I should vex and disorder my mammaWell that is something But not more than she vexes and disorders me on her being made an implement by such a sorry creature who ambles hither every day in spite to my dearest friendWoe be to  both  if it be for a  double end  Chide me if you will I don't care  I say and I insist upon it such a step would  ennoble  your friend And if still you will permit it I will take the office out of Lovelace's hands and tomorrow evening or on Monday before his time of appointment takes place will come in a chariot or chaise And then my dear if we get off as I wish will we make terms and what terms we please with them All My mamma will be glad to receive her daughter again I warrant ye And Hickman will cry for  joy  on my return or he shall for  sorrow    But you are so very earnestly angry with me for proposing such a step and have always so much to say for your side of any question that I am afraid to urge it fartherOnly be so good as to encourage me to resume it if upon farther consideration and upon  weighing matters well and in  this  light Whether best to go off with  me  or with  Lovelace  you can get over your punctilious regard for my reputation A woman going off with a woman is not so discreditable a thing surely and with no view but to avoid the fellowsI say only be so good as to  consider  this point and if you can get over your scruples on  my  account do And so I will have done with this argument for the present and apply myself to some of the passages in yours  A time I hope will come that I shall be able to read your affecting narratives without that impatience and bitterness which now boils over in my heart and would flow to my pen were I to enter into the particulars of what you write And indeed I am afraid of giving you my advice at all or of telling you what I should do in your case supposing you will still refuse my offer finding too what you have been brought or rather driven to without it lest any evil should follow it In which case I should never forgive myself And this consideration has added to my difficulties in writing to you now you are upon such a crisis and yet refuse the only methodBut I said I would not for the present touch any more that string Yet one word more chide me if you please If any harm betide you I shall for ever blame my mammaIndeed I shallAnd perhaps yourself if you do not accept of my offer  But one thing in your present situation and prospects let me advise It is this That if you  do  go away with Mr Lovelace you take the first opportunity to permit the ceremony to pass Why should you  not  when everybody will know by  whose  assistance and in  whose  company you leave your father's house go whithersoever you willYou may indeed keep him at distance until settlements are drawn and suchlike matters are adjusted to your mind But even These are matters of less consideration in your  particular case than they would be in that of most others  Because  be his other faults what they will nobody thinks him an ungenerous man  Because  the possession of your estate must be given up to you as soon as your cousin Morden comes who as your Trustee will see it done and done upon proper terms  Because  there is no want of fortune on his side  Because  all his family value you and are extremely desirous that you should be their relation  Because  he makes no scruple of accepting you without conditions You see how he has always defy'd your relations I for my own part can forgive him for that fault Nor know I if it be not a noble one And I dare say he had rather call you  his  without a shilling than be under obligation to those whom he has full as little reason to love as they have to love him You have heard that his own relations cannot make his proud spirit submit to owe any favour to them  For all these reasons I think you may the less stand upon previous settlements It is therefore my absolute opinion that if you  do  go off with him And in that case you must let  him  be judge when he can leave you with safety you'll observe That you should not postpone the ceremony  Give this matter your most serious consideration Punctilio is out of doors the moment you are out of your father's house I know how justly severe you have been upon those inexcusable creatures whose giddiness and even want of decency have made them in the same hour as I may say leap from a parent's window to a husband's bedBut considering Lovelace's character I repeat my opinion that your Reputation in the eye of the world requires that no delay be made in this point when once you are in his power  I need not I am sure make a stronger plea to  you    You say in excuse for my mamma what my fervent  love for my friend very ill brooks That we ought not to blame anyone for not doing what she has an option to do or to let alone This in cases of friendship would admit of very strict discussion If the thing requested be of  greater  consequence or even of  equal  to the person sought to and it were as the old phrase has it  to take a thorn out of one's friend's foot to put it into our own  something might be saidNay it would be I will venture to say a selfish thing in us to ask a favour of a friend which would subject That friend to the  same  or  equal  inconvenience as That from which we wanted to be relieved The requester would in this case teach his friend by his  own  selfish example with much  better  reason to deny him and despise a friendship so  merely  nominal But if by a  less  inconvenience to ourselves we could relieve our friend from a  greater  the refusal of such a favour makes the refuser unworthy of the name of Friend Nor would I admit such a one not even into the outermost fold of my heart  I am well aware that this is your opinion of friendship as well as mine For I owe the distinction to you upon a certain occasion and it saved me from a very great inconvenience as you must needs remember But you was always for making excuses for  other  people in cases wherein you would not have allowed of one for  yourfelf    I must own that were these excuses for a friend's indifference or denial made by anybody but  you  in a case of such  vast  importance to herself and of so comparative a  small  one to those whose protection she would be thought to wish for I who am for ever as you have often remarked endeavouring to trace effects to their causes should be ready to suspect that there was a latent unowned inclination which balancing or  preponderating  rather made the issue of the alternative show ever important sit more lightly upon the excuser's mind than she cared to own  You will understand me my dear But if you do not it may be as well for me for I am afraid I shall  have it  from you for but starting such a notion or giving a hint which perhaps as you did once in another case you will reprimandingly call  'Not being able to forego the ostentation of sagacity tho' at the expence of that tenderness which is due to friendship and charity'  What signifies owning a fault without mending it you'll sayVery true my dear But you know I ever was a saucy creatureEver stood in need of great allowancesAnd I know likewise that I ever had them from my dear Clarissa Harlowe Nor do I doubt them now For you know how much I love youIf it be possible  more  than  myself  I love you Believe me my dear And in consequence of that belief you will be able to judge how much I am affected by your present distressful and critical situation which will not suffer me to pass by without a censure even that philosophy of temper in your own cause which you have not in another's and which all that know you ever admired you for  From this critical and distressful situation it shall be my hourly prayers that you may be delivered without blemish to that fair fame which has hitherto like your heart been unspotted  With This prayer twenty times repeated concludes  Your everaffectionate ANNA HOWE  I hurry'd myself in writing This and I hurry Robin away with it that in a Situation so very critical you may have all the time possible to consider what I have written upon two points so very important I will repeat them in a very few words  'Whether you choose not rather to go off with one of  your own Sex  with your ANNA HOWE  than with one of the  other  with Mr LOVELACE'  And if not  'Whether you should not marry him as soon as possible'  LETTER XLI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  The preceding letter not received  Saturday Afternoon  ALready have I an ecstatic answer as I may call it to my letter  'He promises compliance in every article with my will Approves of all I propose particularly of the private lodging And thinks it a happy expedient to obviate the censures of the busy and the unreflecting And yet he hopes that the putting myself into the protection of either of his aunts treated as I am treated would be far from being looked upon by any in a disreputable light But every thing I injoin or resolve upon must he says be right not only with respect to my present but future honour with regard to which he hopes so to behave himself as to be  allow'd  to be next to myself more solicitous than anybody He will only assure me that his whole family are extremely desirous to take advantage of the persecutions I labour under to make their court and endear themselves to me by their best and most chearful services Happy if they can in any measure contribute to my present freedom and future happiness  'He will this afternoon he says write to his uncle and to both his aunts that he is now within view of being the happiest man in the world if it be not his own fault since the only woman upon earth that can make him so will be soon out of danger of being another man's and cannot possibly prescribe  any terms to him that he shall not think it his duty to comply with  'He flatters himself now my last letter  confirming  my resolution that he can be in no apprehension of my changing my mind unless my friends change their manner of acting by me which he is too sure they will not And now will all his relations who take such a kind and generous share in his interests glory and pride themselves in the prospects he has before him  Thus artfully does he hold me to it  'As to fortune he begs of me not to be solicitous on that score That his own estate is sufficient for us both not a  nominal  but a  real  two thousand pounds  per annum  equivalent to some estates reputed a third more That it never was incumbred That he is clear of the world both as to book and bonddebts thanks perhaps to his pride more than to his virtue That his uncle moreover resolves to settle upon him a thousand pounds  per annum  on his nuptials And this if he writes to his Lordship's honour more from motives of  justice  than from those of  generosity  as he ought to consider it but as an equivalent for an estate which he had got possession of to which  his  Mr Lovelace's mother had better pretensions That his Lordship also proposed to give him up either his seat in Hertfordshire or that in Lancashire at his own or at his wife's option especially if I am the person All which it will be in my power to see done and proper settlements drawn  before  I enter into any farther engagements with him if I  will  have it so'  He says  'That I need not be under any solicitude as to  apparel  All  immediate  occasions of That sort will be most chearfully supplied by his aunts or his cousins Montague As my others shall with the greatest pride and pleasure if I will allow him that honour by himself  'That I shall govern him as I please with regard to anything in his power towards effecting a reconciliation with my friends A point he knows my heart is set upon  'He is afraid that the time will hardly allow of his procuring Miss Charlotte Montague's attendance upon me at St Albans as he had proposed she should because he understands she keeps her chamber with a violent cold and sore throat But both she and her sister the first moment she is able to go abroad shall visit me at my private lodgings and introduce me to their aunts or their aunts to me as I shall choose and accompany me to town if I please and stay as long in it with me as I shall think fit to stay there  'Lord M will also at my own time and in my own manner that is to say either publicly or privately make me a visit And for his own part when he has seen me in safety either in their protection or in the privacy I prefer he will leave me and not attempt to visit me but by my own permission  'He had thoughts once he says on hearing of his cousin Charlotte's indisposition to have engaged his cousin Patty's attendance upon me either at or about the neighbouring village or at St Albans But he says she is a lowspirited timorous girl who would but the more perplex us'  So my dear the enterprize requires courage and high spirits you seeAnd indeed it doesWhat am I about to do  He himself it is plain thinks it necessary that I should be accompanied with one of my own SexHe might at least have proposed the woman of one of the Ladies of his familyLord bless meWhat am I about to do  AFTER all far as I have gone I know not but I may still recede And if I do a mortal quarrel I  suppose will ensueAnd what if it doesCould there be any way to escape this Solmes a breach with Lovelace might make way for the Single Life so much my preferable wish to take place And then I would defy the Sex For I see nothing but trouble and vexation that they bring upon ours And when once enter'd one is obliged to go on with them treading with tender feet upon thorns and sharper thorns to the end of a painful journey  What to do I know not The more I think the more I am embarrass'dAnd the stronger will be my doubts as the appointed time draws nearer  But I will go down and take a little turn in the garden and deposite This and his letters all but the two last which I will inclose in my next if I have opportunity to write another  Mean time my dear friendBut what can I desire you to pray forAdieu thenLet me only sayAdieu  LETTER XLII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss HOWE In answer to Letter  XL    Sunday Morning April  DO not think my beloved friend altho' you have given me in yours of yesterday a  severer  instance of what nevertheless I must call your  impartial  Love than ever yet I received from you that I will be displeased with you for it That would be to put myself into the inconvenient situation of Royalty That is to say Out of the way of ever being told of my faults of ever mending them and In the way of making the sincerest and warmest friendship useless to me  And then how brightly how nobly burns this sacred flame in your bosom that you are ready to  impute to the unhappy sufferer a  less degree  of warmth in  her own  cause than  you  have for her because she endeavours to divest herself of  Self  so far as to leave others to the option which they have a right to make Ought I my dear to blame ought I not rather to admire you for this ardor  But nevertheless lest you should think that there is any foundation for a surmize which altho' it owe its rise to your friendship would if there  were  leave me utterly inexcusable I must injustice to myself declare That I know not my own heart if I have any of that  latent  or  unowned inclination  which you would impute to  any other but me  Nor does the  important alternative sit lightly on my mind  And yet I must excuse your mamma were it but on this single consideration That I could not presume to reckon upon  her  favour as I could upon her  daughter  's so as to make the claim of friendship upon  her  to whom as the mother of my dearest friend a veneration is owing which can hardly be compatible with that sweet familiarity which is one of the indispensibles of the sacred tie by which your heart and mine are bound in one  What therefore I might expect from my  Anna Howe  I  ought not  from her  mamma  for would it not be very strange that a person of her experience should be reflected upon because she gave not up her own judgment where the consequence of her doing so would be to embroil herself as she apprehends with a family she has lived well with and in behalf of a child against her parentsAs she has moreover a daughter of her ownA daughter too give me leave to say of whose vivacity and charming spirits she is more apprehensive than she need to be because her truly maternal cares make her fear more from her  youth  than she hopes from her  prudence  which nevertheless she and all the world know to be  beyond  her years  And here let me add That whatever you may  generously and as the result of an ardent affection for your unhappy friend urge on this head in my behalf or harshly against any one who may refuse me protection in such extraordinary circumstances as I find myself in I have some pleasure in being able to curb undue expectations upon my indulgent friends whatever were to befal myself from those circumstances for I should be extremely mortified were I by my selfish forwardness to give occasion for such a check as to be told that I had encouraged an unreasonable hope or according to the phrase you mention wished to take a  Thorn out of my own foot and to put it into that of my friend  Nor should I be better pleased with myself if having been taught by my good Mrs Norton that the best of schools is  That of affliction  I should rather learn impatience than the contrary by the lessons I am obliged to get by heart in it and if I should judge of the merits of others as they were  kind to me  and that at the expence of their own convenience or peace of mind For is not This to suppose myself ever in the right and all who do not act as I would have them act perpetually in the wrong In short to make  my  sake  God  's sake in the sense of Mr Solmes's pitiful plea to me  How often my dear have You and I endeavour'd to detect and censure this partial spirit in others  But I know you do not always content yourself with saying what you think may  justly  be said But in order to shew the extent of a penetration which can go to the bottom of any subject delight to say or to write all that  can  be said or  written  or even  thought  on the particular occasion and this partly perhaps from being desirous pardon me my dear to be thought mistress of a sagacity that is aforehand with events But who would wish to drain off or dry up a refreshing current because it now and then puts us to some little inconvenience by its overflowings In other words who would not allow for the  liveliness of a spirit which for one painful sensibility gives an hundred pleasurable ones And the  one  in consequence of the  other  But now I come to the two points in your letter that most sensibly concern me Thus you put them  'Whether I choose not rather to go off with one of my  own Sex  with my ANNA HOWEthan with one of the  other  with Mr LOVELACE'  And if  not    'Whether I should not marry him as soon as possible'  You know my dear my reasons for rejecting your proposal and even for being earnest that you should not be  known  to be assisting to me in an enterprize which a cruel necessity induced  me  to think of engaging in and which  you  have not the same plea for At this rate  well  might your mamma be uneasy at our correspondence not knowing to what inconveniencies it might subject her and youIf  I  am hardly excusable to think of flying from my  unkind  friends what could  you  have to say for yourself were you to abandon a mother so  indulgent  Does she suspect that your fervent friendship may lead you to a  small  indiscretion and does this suspicion offend you And would you in revenge shew her and the world that you can voluntarily rush into the  highest error  that any of our sex can be guilty of  And is it worthy of your generosity I ask you my dear is it to think of taking so undutiful a step because you believe your mamma would be glad to receive you again  I do assure you that were I to take this step myself I would run all risques rather than you should accompany me in it Have I do you think a desire to  double  and  treble  my own fault in the eye of the world In the eye of that world which cruelly as I am used not knowing all would not acquit  me  But my dearest kindest friend let me tell you That we will  neither  of us take such a step The manner of putting your questions abundantly convinces me that I ought not in  your  opinion to  attempt  it You no doubt intend that I shall  so  take it and I thank you for the equally polite and forcible conviction  It is some satisfaction to me taking the matter in this light that I had begun to waver before I received your last And now I tell you that it has absolutely determin'd me  not  to go away at least not tomorrow  If  You  my dear think the  issue of the alternative  to use your own words  sits so lightly upon my mind  ▪ in short that my  inclination  is  faulty  the  world  would treat me much less scrupulously When therefore you represent  that all punctilio must be at an end the moment I am out of my father's house  and hint that I must submit it to Lovelace to judge  when  he can leave me with safety that is to say give  him  the option whether he will leave me or not Who can bear these reflections and resolve to incur these inconveniences that has the question still in her own power to decide upon  While I thought only of an escape from  This house  as an escape from Mr  Solmes  that already my reputation suffer'd by my confinement and that it would be still in my own option either to marry Mr Lovelace or wholly to renounce him Bold as the step was I thought treated as I am treated something was to be said in excuse of itIf not to the world to  myself  And to be  self  acquitted is a blessing to be preferred to the opinion of all the world But after I have censured that indiscreet forwardness in some who flying from their chamber to the altar have without the  least  ceremony rush'd upon the  greatest  After I have stipulated with him for time and for an ultimate option whether to accept or refuse him and for his leaving me as soon as I am in a place of safety  which as you observe  he  must be the judge of And after he has comply'd with these terms so that I cannot if I  would  recall them and suddenly marryYou see my dear that I have nothing left me but to resolve  not  to go away with him  But how on this revocation shall I be able to pacify him  HowWhy assert the privilege of my SexSurely on  This  side of the solemnity he has no  right  to be displeased Besides did I not reserve a power of receding if I saw fit To what purpose as I asked in the case between your mamma and you has anybody an option if the making use of it shall give the refused a right to be disgusted  Far very far would  Those  be who according to the Old Law have a  right  of  absolving  or  confirming  a child's promise from ratifying  mine  had it been ever  so solemn  a one  See  Numb  xxx Where it is declared whose vows shall be binding and whose not The vows of a man or of a widow are there pronounced to be indispensible because they are sole and subject to no other domestic authority But the vows of a single woman and of a wife if the father of the one or the husband of the other disallow of them as soon as they know them are to be of no force  A matter highly necessary to be known by all young ladies especially whose designing addressers too often endeavour to engage them by vows and then plead conscience and honour to them to hold them down to the performance  It cannot be amiss to recite the very words  Ver  If a woman vow a vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth    And her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand    But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth not any if her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand And the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her  The same in the case of a wife as said above See ver  c  And all is thus solemnly closed  Ver  These are the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses between a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in her youth in her father's house  But This was rather an  appointment  than a  promise  And suppose it had been  the latter and that I had  not  reserv'd to myself a liberty of revoking it was it to preclude  better  or  maturer  considerationIf so how unfit to be givenHow ungenerous to be insisted uponAnd how unfitter still to be keptIs there a man living who ought to be angry that a woman whom he hopes one day to call his shall refuse to keep a rash promise when on the maturest deliberation she is convinc'd that it  was  a rash one  I resolve then upon the whole to stand This one trial of Wednesday nextOr perhaps I should rather say of Tuesday evening if my father hold his purpose of endeavouring in person to make me  read  or  hear  read and then  sign  the settlements  That that  must be the greatest trial of all  If I am compelled to sign them overnightThen the Lord bless me must All I dread follow as of course on WednesdayIf I can prevail upon them by my prayersPerhaps by fits and delirium for the very first appearance of my father after having been so long banish'd his presence will greatly affect me to lay aside their views or to suspend if but for one week if  not  but for two or three days still Wednesday will be a lighter day of trialThey will surely give me time to  consider  to argue with myselfThis will not be  promising  As I have made no effort to get away they have no reason to suspect me so I may have an opportunity in the last resort to escape Mrs Norton is to be with me She altho' she should be check'd for it will in my extremity plead for me My aunt Hervey  may  on such extremity join her Perhaps my mamma may be brought over I will kneel to each one by one to make a friend They have been afraid some of them to see me lest they should be moved in my favour Does not This give me a reasonable hope that I  may  move themMy brother's counsel heretofore given to turn me out of doors to my evil destiny may again  be repeated and may prevail  Then  shall I be in no  worse  case than  now  as to the displeasure of my friends and thus far  better  that it will not be my fault that I leave them and seek another protection Which even  then  ought to be my cousin Morden's rather than Mr Lovelace's or any other person's  My heart in short misgives me less when I resolve  This  way than when I think of the  other  And in so strong and involuntary a byass the  heart  is as I may say  Conscience  And well cautions the wise man  'Let the counsel of thine own heart stand for there is no man more faithful to thee than It For a man's mind is sometimes wont to tell him more than seven watchmen that fit above in a high tower'  Ecclus  xxxvii  Forgive these indigested selfreasonings I will close here And instantly set about a letter of revocation to Mr Lovelace take it as he will It will only be another trial of temper to  him  To  me  of infinite importance And has he not promised temper and acquiescence on the supposition of a change in my mind  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XLIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sunday Morning April  NOBODY it seems will go to church this day No blessing to be expected perhaps upon views so worldly and in some so cruel  They have a mistrust that I have some device in my head Betty has been looking among my cloaths I found her on coming up from depositing my letter to Lovelace for I  have  written peering among them the key being in the lock She colour'd and was  confounded to be caught But I only said I should be accustom'd to  any  sort of treatment in timeIf she had her ordersthose were enough for her  She own'd in her confusion that a motion had been made to abridge me of my airings and the report  she  should make would be no disadvantage to me One of my friends she told me urged in my behalf That there was no need of laying me under greater restraint since Mr Lovelace's threatening to  rescue  me by violence were I to have been carry'd to my uncle's was a conviction that I had no design to go off to him voluntarily and that if I  had  I should have made preparations of that kind  before now  and most probably been detected in them  Hence  It was also inferr'd that there was no room to doubt but I would at last comply And added the bold creature if you don't intend to do so Your conduct Miss seems strange to meOnly thus she reconciled it That I had gone so far I knew not how to come off  genteelly  And she fancy'd I should in  full congregation  on Wednesday give Mr Solmes my hand And then said the confident wench as the learned Dr Brand took his text last Sunday  There will be joy in heaven    This is the substance of my letter to Mr Lovelace  'That I have reasons of the greatest consequence to  myself  and which when known must satisfy  him  to suspend for the present my intention of leaving my father's house That I have hopes that matters may be brought to an happy conclusion without taking a step which nothing but the last necessity could justify And that he may depend upon my promise that I will die rather than consent to marry Mr Solmes'  And so I am preparing myself to stand the shock of his exclamatory reply But be that what it will it cannot affect me so much as the apprehensions of what may happen to me next Tuesday or Wednesday  for now those apprehensions engage my whole attention and make me sick at the very heart  Sunday Four o'Clock P M  MY letter is not yet taken awayIf he should not send for it or take it and come hither on my not meeting him tomorrow in doubt of what may have befallen me what shall I do Why had I any concerns with this SexI that was so happy till I knew This man  I din'd in the Ivy summerhouse It was comply'd with at the first word To shew I meant nothing I went again into the house with Betty as soon as I had dined I thought it was not amiss to ask this liberty the weather seeming to be set in fine One does not know what Tuesday or Wednesday may produce  Sunday Evening Seven o'Clock  THERE remains my letter stillHe is busied I suppose in his preparations for tomorrow But then he has servants Does the man think he is so  secure  of me that having appointed he need not give himself any further concern about me till the very momentHe knows how I am beset He knows not what may happen I  might  be ill or still more closely watched or confined than before The correspondence  might  be discovered It  might  be necessary to vary the scheme I  might  be forced into measures which might intirely frustrate my purpose I  might  have new doubts I  might  suggest something more convenient for any thing he knew What can the man mean I wonderYet it shall lie for if he has it any time before the appointed hour it will save me declaring to him personally my changed purpose and the trouble of contending with him on that score If he send for it at all he will see by the date that he might have had it in time and if he be put to any  inconvenience from shortness of notice let him take it for his pains  Sunday Night Nine o'Clock  IT is determined it seems to send to Mrs Norton to be here on Tuesday to dinner and she is to stay with me for a whole week  So she is first to endeavour to persuade me to comply and when the violence is done she is to comfort me and try to reconcile me to my fate They expect  fits  and  fetches  Betty insolently tells me and expostulations and exclamations  without number  But everybody will be prepared for them And when it's over it's over and I shall be easy and pacified when I find I cannot help it  Mond Morn April Seven o'Clock  O MY dear There yet lies the letter just as I left it  Does he think he is so sure of mePerhaps he imagines that I  dare not  alter my purpose I wish I had never known himI begin now to see this rasthness in the light everyone else would have seen it in had I been guilty of itBut what can I do if he come today at the appointed timeIf he receive not the letter I must see him or he will think something has befallen me and certainly will come to the house As certainly he will be insulted And what in that case may be the consequenceThen I as good as promised that I would take the first opportunity to see him if I changed my mind and to give him my reasons for it I have no doubt but he will be out of humour upon it But better  he  meet me and go away dissatisfied with  me  than that  I  should go away dissatisfied with  myself    Yet short as the time is he may still perhaps send and get the letter Something may have happened to prevent him which when known will excuse him  After I have disappointed him more than once before on a requested  interview  only it is impossible he should not have  curiosity  at least to know if something has not happened and if my mind hold in this more  important case  And yet as I rashly confirm'd my resolution by a second letter I begin now to doubt it  Nine o'Clock  MY cousin Dolly Hervey slid the inclosed letter into my hand as I passed by her coming out of the garden  Dearest Madam  I Have got intelligence from one as says she knows that you must be married on Wednesday morning to Mr Solmes Maybe howsoever only to vex me for it is Betty Barnes A saucy creature I'm sure A license is got as she says And so far she went as to tell me bidding me say nothing but she knew as that I would that Mr Brand the young Oxford Clergyman and fine scholar is to marry you For Dr Lewin I hear refuses unless you consent and they have heard that he does not like overwell their proceedings against you and says as that you don't deserve to be treated so cruelly as you are treated But Mr Brand I am told is to have his fortune made by uncle Harlowe and among them  You will know better than I what to make of all these matters for sometimes I think Betty tells me things as if I should not tell you and yet expects as that I will She and all the world knows how I love you And so I would  have  them It is an honour to me to love such a dear young Lady who is an honour to all her family let them say what they will But there is such whispering between this Betty and Miss Harlowe as you can't imagine and when that is done Betty comes and tells me something  This seems to be sure and that is why I write But  pray burn it you are to be searched once more for letters and for pen and ink for they know you write Something they pretend to have betray'd out of one of Mr Lovelace's servants as they hope to make something of I know not what That must be a very vilde and wicked man who would brag of Lady's goodness to him and tell secrets Mr Lovelace is too much of a gentleman for that I dare say If not who can be safe of young innocent creatures such as we be  Then they have a notion from that false Betty I beliefe as that you intend to take something to make yourself sick or some such thing and so they will search for phials and powders and suchlike  Strange searching among them God bless us young creatures when we come among such suspicious relations But thank God my mamma is not such a one at the present  If nothing be found you are to be used kindlier for that by your papa at the grand judgment as I may call it  Yet sick or well alas my dear cousin you must be married belike So says this same creature and I don't doubt it But your husband is to go home every night till you are reconciled to go to him And so illness can be no pretence to save you  They are sure you will make a good wife when you be one So would not I unless I liked my husband And Mr Solmes is always telling them how he will purchase your love and all that by jewels and fine thingsA siccofant of a manI wish he and Betty Barnes were to come together and he would beat her everyday till she was goodSo in brief secure every thing you would not have seen And burn This I beg you And pray dearest Madam do not take nothing as may hurt your health For that will not do I am  Your truly loving Cousin D H  When I first read my cousin's letter I was half inclin'd to resume my former intention especially as my countermanding letter is not taken away And as my heart akes at the thoughts of the conflict I must expect to have with him on my refusal For see him for a few moments I doubt I must lest he should take some rash resolutions especially as he has reason to expect I will But here your words  That all punctilio is at an end the moment I am out of my father's house  added to the still more cogent considerations of Duty and Reputation determin'd me once more against taking the rash step And it will be very hard altho' no seasonable fainting or wish'dfor fit should stand my friend if I cannot gain one month or fortnight or week And I have still more hopes that I shall prevail for some delay from my cousin's intimation that the good Doctor Lewin refuses to give his assistance to their projects if they have not my consent and thinks me cruelly used Since without taking notice that I am apprized of this I can plead a scruple of conscience and insist upon having that worthy Divine's opinion upon it Which inforced as I shall inforce it my mamma will surely second me in My aunt Hervey and my Mrs Norton will support  her  The suspension must follow And I can but get away afterwards  But if they  will  compel me If they  will  give me no time If nobody  will  be moved If it be resolved that the ceremony shall be read over my constrained handWhy thenAlas What thenI can butBut what O my dear This Solmes shall never have my vows I am resolved And I will say nothing but No as long as I shall be able to speak And who will presume to look upon such an act of violence as a marriageIt is impossible surely that a father and mother can see such a dreadful compulsion offer'd to their childBut if mine should  withdraw and leave the task to my brother and sister they will have no mercy  I am griev'd to be driven to have recourse to the following artifices  I have given them a clue by the feather of a pen sticking out where they will find such of my hidden stores as I intend they shall find  Two or three little essays I have left easy to be seen of my own writing  About a dozen lines also of a letter begun to you in which I express my hopes altho' I say that appearances are against me that my friends will relent They know from your mamma by my uncle Antony that some how or other I now and then get a letter to you In this piece of a letter I declare renewedly my firm resolution to give up the man so obnoxious to my family on their releasing me from the address of the other  Near the essays I have left a copy of my letter to Lady Drayton  See Letter  xiii  p    of this Vol  which affording arguments suitable to my case may chance thus accidentally to be fallen upon to incline them to favour me  I have reserves of pens and ink you may believe and one or two in the Ivy summerhouse with which I shall amuse myself in order to lighten if possible those apprehensions which more and more affect me as Wednesday the day of trial approaches  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XLIV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Ivy summerhouse Eleven o'Clock  HE has not yet got my letter And while I was contriving here how to send my officious gaoleress from me that I might have time for the intended  interview and had hit upon an expedient which I believe would have done came my aunt and furnish'd me with a much better She saw my little table covered preparative to my solitary dinner and hoped she told me that this would be the last day that my friends would be deprived of my company at table  You may believe my dear that the thoughts of meeting Mr Lovelace the fear of being discover'd together with the contents of my cousin Dolly's letter gave me great and visible emotions She took notice of themWhy these sighs why these heavings here said she patting my neckO my dear niece who would have thought so much natural sweetness could be so very unpersuadable  I could not answer her and she proceededI am come I doubt upon a very unwelcome errand Some things that have been told us yesterday which came from the mouth of one of the most desperate and insolent men in the world convince your father and all of us that you still find means to write out of the house Mr Lovelace knows everything that is done here and that as soon as done and great mischief is apprehended from him which you are as much concerned as anybody to prevent Your mamma has also some apprehensions concerning yourself which yet she hopes are groundless but however cannot be easy nor will be permitted to be easy if she would unless while you remain here in the garden or in this summerhouse you give her the opportunity once more of looking into your closet your cabinet and drawers It will be the better taken if you give me chearfully your keys I hope my dear you won't dispute it Your desire of dining in this place was the more readily comply'd with for the sake of such an opportunity  I thought myself very lucky to be so well prepared by my cousin Dolly's means for this search  But yet I artfully made some scruples and not a few complaints of this treatment After which I not only gave her the keys of all but even officiously empty'd my pockets before her and invited her to put her fingers in my stays that she might be sure that I had no papers there  This highly obliged her and she said She would represent my chearful compliance as it deserved  let my brother and sister say what they would  My mamma in particular she was sure would rejoice at the opportunity given her to obviate as she doubted not would be the case some suspicions that were raised against me  She then hinted That there were methods taken to come at all Mr Lovelace's secrets and even from his careless communicativeness at some of  mine  it being she said his custom boastingly to prate to his very servants of his intentions in particular cases She added that deep as he was thought to be my brother was as deep as he and fairly too hard for him at his own weaponsas one day it would be found  I knew not I said the meaning of these dark hints I thought the cunning she hinted at on  both  sides called rather for contempt than applause I myself might have been put upon artifices which my heart disdained to practise had I given way to the resentment which I was bold to say was much more justifiable than the actions that occasion'd it That it was evident to me from what she had said that their present suspicions of me were partly owing to this supposed superior cunning of my brother and partly to the consciousness that the usage I met with might naturally produce a reason for such suspicions That it was very unhappy for me to be made the butt of my brother's wit That it would have been more to his praise to have aimed at shewing a kind heart than a cunning head That nevertheless I wished  he knew  himself  as well as I imagin'd  I  knew him and he would then have less conceit of his abilities Which abilities would in my opinion be less thought of if his power to do ill offices were not much greater than them  I was vex'd I could not help making this reflection The dupe the other too probably makes of him thro' his own spy deserv'd it But I so little approve of this low art in either that were I but tolerably used the vileness of that man that Joseph Leman should be inquired into  She was sorry she said to find that I thought so disparagingly of my brother He was a young gentleman both of learning and parts  Learning enough I said to make him vain of it among us women But not of parts sufficient to make his learning valuable either to himself or to anybody else  She wished indeed that he had more goodnature But she feared that I had too great an opinion of somebody else to think so well of my brother as a sister ought Since between the two there was a sort of rivalry as to abilities that made them hate one another  Rivalry  Madam said IIf that be the case or whether it be or not I wish they both understood better than either of them seems to do what it becomes gentlemen and men of liberal education to be and to doNeither of them then would glory in what they ought to be ashamed of  But waving this subject it was not impossible I said that they might find a little of my writing and a pen or two and a little ink Hated artor rather hateful the necessity for it as I was not permitted to go up to put them out of the way But if they did I must be contented And I assured her that t  ke what time they pleased I would not go in to disturb them but would be either in or near the garden  in this summerhouse or in the cedar one about my poultryyard or near the great cascade till I was order'd to return to my prison With like cunning I said that I supposed the unkind search would not be made till the servants had dined because I doubted not that the pert Betty Barnes who knew all the corners of my apartment and closet would be imploy'd in it  She hoped she said that nothing could be found that would give a handle against me For she would assure me the motives to the search on my mamma's part especially were that she hoped to find reason rather to acquit than to blame me and that my papa might be induced to see me tomorrow night or Wednesday morning with temper With  tenderness  I should rather say said she for he is resolved so to do if no new offence be given  Ah Madam said I  Why that Ah Madam and shaking your head so significantly  I wish Madam that I may not have more reason to dread my papa's continued displeasure than to hope for his returning tenderness  You don't  know  my dearThings may take a turnThings may not be so bad as you fear  Dearest Madam have you any consolation to give me  Why my dear it is possible that  you  may be more compliable than you have been  Why raised you my hopes MadamDon't let me think my dear aunt Hervey cruel to a niece who truly honours her  I may tell you more perhaps said she but in confidence in absolute confidence if the inquiry within come out in your favour Do you know of anything above that can be found to your disadvantage  Some papers they will find I doubt But I must take consequences My brother and sister will be at  hand with their goodnatured constructions I am made desperate and care not what is found  She hoped she  earnestly  hoped she said that nothing could be found that would impeach my discretion and thenBut she might say too much  And away she went having added to my perplexity  But I now can think of nothing but this manThis interviewWould to Heaven it were overTo meet to quarrelBut I will not stay a moment with him let him take what measures he will upon it if he be not quite calm and resigned  Don't you see how crooked some of my lines are Don't you see how some of the letters stagger more than othersThat is when this interview is more in my head than my subject  But after all should I  ought  I to meet him How I have taken it for granted that I shouldI wish there were time to take your advice Yet you are so loth to speak  quite  outBut that I owe as you own to the difficulty of my situation  I should have mentioned that in the course of this conversation I besought my aunt to stand my friend and to put in a word for me on my approaching trial and to endeavour to procure me time for consideration if I could obtain nothing else  She told me that after the ceremony was perform'd odious confirmation of a hint in my cousin Dolly's letter I should have what time I pleased to reconcile myself to my lot before cohabitation  This put me out of all patience  She requested of me in  her  turn she said that I would resolve to meet them all with chearful duty and with a spirit of absolute acquiescence It was in my power to make them all happy And how affectingly joyful would it be to her she said to see my father my mother my uncles my brother my sister all embracing me with raptures and folding me by turns to their fond hearts and congratulating each  other on their restored happiness Her own joy she said would probably make her motionless and speechless for a time And for her Dollythe poor girl who had suffer'd in the esteem of some for her  grateful  attachment to me would have everybody love her again  Will you doubt my dear that my next trial will be the most affecting that I have yet had  My aunt set forth all this in so strong a light and I was so particularly touched on my cousin Dolly's account that impatient as I was just before I was greatly moved Yet could only shew by my sighs and my tears how desirable such an event would be to me could it be brought about upon conditions with which it was possible for me to comply  Here comes Betty Barnes with my dinner  The wench is gone The time of meeting is at hand O that he may not comeBut should I or should I not meet himHow I question without possibility of a timely answer  Betty according to my leading hint to my aunt boasted to me that she was to be  imploy'd  as she called it after she had eat her own dinner  She should be sorry she told me to have me found out Yet 'twould be all for my good I should have it in my power to be forgiven for all at once before Wednesday night The Confidence then to stifle a laugh put a corner of her apron in her mouth and went to the door And on her return to take away as I angrily bid her she begg'd my excuseButButand then the saucy creature laugh'd again she could not help it to think how I had drawn myself in by my summerhouse dinnering since it had given so fine an opportunity by way of surprize to look into all my private hoards She thought something was in the wind when my brother came into my dining here so readily Her young master was too  hard for everybody 'Squire Lovelace himself was nothing at all at a quick thought to her young master  My aunt mention'd Mr Lovelace's boasting behaviour to  his  servants Perhaps he  may  be so mean But as to my brother he always took a pride in making himself appear to be a man of parts and learning to our servants  Pride  and  Meanness  I have often thought are as nearly ally'd and as close borderers upon each other as the poet tells us  Wit  and  Madness  are  But why do I trouble you and myself at such a crisis with these impertinenciesYet I would forget if I could the nearest evil the interview because my apprehensions increasing as the hour is at hand I should were my attention to be ingrossed by them be unfit to see him if he does come And then he will have too much advantage over me as he will have seeming reason to reproach me with change of resolution  The  upbraider  you know my dear is in some sense a superior while the  upbraided  if with reason upbraided must make a figure as spiritless as conscious  I know that this wretch will if he  can  be his own judge and  mine  too But the latter he shall  not  be  I dare say we shall be all to pieces But I don't care for that It would be hard if I who have held it out so sturdily to my father and uncles should notBut he is at the gardendoor  I was mistakenHow may noises  un  like be made  like  what one fearsWhy flutters the fool so  I will hasten to deposite this Then I will for the last time go to the usual place in hopes to find that he has got my letter If he  has  I will not meet him If he has  not  I will take it back and shew him what  I have written That will break the ice as I may say and save me much circumlocution and reasoning And a stedfast adherence to that my written mind is all that will be necessaryThe interview must be as short as possible for should it be discover'd it would furnish a new and strong pretence for the intended evil of Wednesday next  Perhaps I shall not be able to write again one while Perhaps not till I am the miserable property of that SolmesBut that shall never never be while I have my senses  If your servant find nothing from me by Wednesday morning you may conclude that I can then neither write to you nor receive your favours  In that case pity and pray for me my beloved friend and continue to me that place in your affection which is the pride of my life and the only comfort left to  Your CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XLV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    St Alban's  Tuesday Morn past One  O my dearest friend  AFTER what I had resolved upon as by my former what shall I write What  can I  With what consciousness even by  Letter  do I approach youYou will soon hear if already you have not heard from the mouth of common fame that your Clarissa Harlowe is gone off with a man  I am busying myself to give you the particulars at large The whole twentyfour hours of each day to begin the moment I can fix shall be imployed in it till it is finished Everyone of the hours I mean that will be spared me by this interrupting man to  whom I have made myself so foolishly accountable for too many of them Rest is departed from me I have no call for That And That has no balm for the wounds of my mind So you'll have all those hours without interruption till the account is ended  But will you receive shall you be  permitted  to receive my letters after what I have done  O my dearest friendBut I must make the best of it I hope that will not be very bad Yet am I convinced that I did a rash an inexcusable thing in meeting him and all his tenderness all his vows cannot pacify my inward reproaches on that account  The bearer comes to you my dear for the little parcel of linen which I sent you with far better and more agreeeble hopes  Send not my letters Send the linen only Except you will favour me with one line to tell me you will love me still and that you will suspend your censures till you have the whole before you I am the readier to send thus early because if you have deposited anything for me you may cause it to be taken back or withhold anything you had but intended to send  Adieu my dearest friendI beseech you to love me stillBut alas what will your mamma sayWhat will mineWhat my other relationsand what my dear Mrs Norton And how will my brother and sister triumph  I cannot at present tell you how or where you can direct to me For very early shall I leave this place harrassed and fatigued to death But when I can do nothing else constant use has made me able to write Long very long has that been all my amusement and pleasure Yet could not that have been such to me had I not had you my bestbeloved friend to write to Once more adieu Pity and pray for  Your CL HARLOWE  LETTER XLVI Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Tuesday Nine o' Clock  I Write because you enjoin me

for particulars  Lord have mercy upon meBut can it be  My mamma will  indeed  be astonishedHow can I tell it to herIt was but last night that I assured her upon some jealousies put into her head by your foolish uncle and this upon the strength of your own assurances that neither man nor devil would be able to induce you to take a step that was in the least derogatory to the most punctilious honour  But once more Can it be What woman at this rateBut God preserve you  Let nothing escape you in your letters Direct them for me however to Mrs Knollys's till further notice  OBSERVE my dear

repeat my former adviceIf you are  not  married by this time be sure delay not the ceremonySince things are as they are I wish it were thought that you were privately married before you went away If these men plead AUTHORITY to our pain when we are  theirs  why should we not in such a case as  this  make some good out of the hated word for our reputation when we are induced to violate a more natural one  Your brother and sister that vexes me almost as much as any thing have now their ends Now I suppose will go forward alterations of wills and suchlike spiteful doings  Miss Lloyd and Miss
