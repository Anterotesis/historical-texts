 FAMILY SECRETS  LITERARY  AND  DOMESTICK  BY MR PRATT  IN  FIVE VOLUMES  VOL II  Here's much to do with LOVE and more with HATE  SHAKESPEARE  LONDON  PRINTED FOR T N LONGMAN PATERNOSTERROW    TO MRS COCKBURNE OF MADRAS  IT was the opinion of Mrs COCKBURNE that much of the literary matter which the author had some thoughts of offering to the public separately in an introductory volume with a delineation of some of the characters and a design of the work might be wrought with better effect into the work itself He leaves the public to judge how far he is authorised in adopting that opinion The accurate and able manner in which this lady at a very early period of life transfused into the English language as well the  profound  and  abstract  as gay and elegant "THOUGHTS" of the celebrated  citizen of Geneva  Thoughts of JeanJacques Rousseau translated by Miss Henrietta Colebrooke  where he "reechoes in the character of the  Genius  and  Representative  of human nature and communicates to his readers that enthusiastic love of nature and virtue which glowed in his own breast" at the same time that she has avoided intermixing the eccentricities and errors of what is excellent and useful in the writings of that exalted geniussufficiently evinces the sterling value of her observations The author therefore has again ventured to incorporate  part  of what he had indeed twice before embodied and withdrawn from a sincere doubt of his own powers to interweave it with  advantage  to the general in+terests of the book for therein only can there be hazard Of the POSSIBILITY of  raising  the general character of the English romance by the interspersion of subjects of weight and sublimity either in science or morals so as likewise to raise the passions and affections of the fable there cannot be a doubt and it has indeed been by several  authors occasionally attempted and with success to a degree but with apparent apprehension The author of these pages is therefore perfectly satisfied that the IDEA with which Mrs COCKBURNE has honoured him will receive the unequivocal suffrage of the professional critics to whom his attempt to realise it is submitted and could he have a moment's apprehension of that IDEA meeting disapprobation he would certainly not have subjected her to any part of the censure he may incur from his own failure in the management of it  But the obligation which the author owes to Mrs COCKBURNE on the score of literary arrangement is not the sole motive for addressing to her a proportion of this work and  that  without any previous solicitation The selecting of a patron is he conceives amongst the  inherent  RIGHTS of literature which however he is aware her delicacy would in the present instance have disputed or denied but there are privileges of an independent nature the assertion of which should rest on our own judgment and  discretion and any  petition  to exercise these implies a doubt even that they exist The  freedom of election  as to the choice of a virtuous person to exemplify a virtuous even though it may be an unsuccessful endeavour ought to be looked upon as amongst the most inalienable rights attached to th√® charter of literature On that authority a writer should feel that he has  The world before him where to choose  and on that authority the author of these sheets takes leave to illustrate by the conduct of Mrs COCKBURNE his attempted portrait of a female which may serve as an example of the filial fraternal and conjugal virtues and to sanction this illustration he refers to that lady's family and friends nay to a yet stronger testimonyher own CONSCIOUS HEART  CONTENTS OF VOLUME THE SECOND  CHAP I  Topsyturvy the art of inversion  CHAP II

purposes began in the morning and continued until the evening and were indeed resumed the next morning  A gentleman now arrived at the castle of a very singular character and conversation His youth had been past partly at sea and partly in foreign climes and being in possession of a very competent fortune as well from patrimony as from successful adventure he had for some years back quitted the ocean and all its enterprises and set himself down on shore in a very comfortable dwelling within a neighbourly distance of Fitzorton Castle Mr Partington had many peculiaritiesthere was a rough honesty  in his manner and a fredom of expression corresponding to it which at first sight seemed more boisterous and rugged than the element on which he had been educated His person was something under the middle size and his features had little more of smoothness than his manners but beneath this uninviting exterior beat a heart every pulsation of which was genuine goodwill to mankind without the least alloy of  sentimentality  that shining dross which makes so much glitter in these tinsel times Partington if he liked you was a friend  indeed  but the more he fancied you the rougher would you find his address and this rule held good in all the degrees of his approbationfor exactly proportioned to his  good opinion  was his jocular rudeness If he thought tolerably  well  of you he would call you a sad fellow if on farther acquaintance you improved in his good graces you would advance also in the scale of abuse and he would speak of and  to  you as a cursed goodfornothing devil and when he had taken you into his heartwherein by the  bye you might confide your honour your happiness and your lifehe would honour you by the appellation of a damned insufferable scoundrel This being the highest and most distinguishing mark of his esteem could be boasted of by few for Partington never thought any man or woman deserving of  this  mark of his affection unless they appeared to him preeminently great or good We say "man or woman" because the sex of the person made no manner of difference to him  His  dislike  on the other hand was expressed in quite a  contrary  way but still he marked it by the same gradations If neither your head nor your heart was satisfactory to himthat is if the first was not worth carrying upon your shoulders nor the other in your bosomhe would if he spoke to you at all accost you in very civil language If you had any thing remarkably base in your disposition he would be yet more polite calling you sir or madam and if he thought you deserved a box on the ear or the gallows instead of a bow he would  even  pull off his hat  which being the last evidence of his  abhorrence  bore the same proportion of contempt that his  damned insufferable scoundrel  did of affection Nor were even his benevolences themselves less remarkably his own than his modes of expression He never  talked  of doing any person a kindness and yet was kindness itself In truth while other people were  only  talking he would be doing the very thing they talked about for he would slip out of company on fifty different pretences none of which you could suspectand have had an interview with the party he had heard commiseratedthen return to the company with no alteration in his general manner but that of loading with exaggerated scurrility the person to whom he was indebted for the opportunity of being bountiful for as this was the highest obligation his heart was capable of receiving he had no other way of returning it But more frequently he would appear altogether inattentive to tales of distress or if he  did  give ear to them would break out into"Pshadon't tell me  riffraff stuff a pack of beggars I should not have thought of their impudence I say distress too" and many such like exclamations yet he would be at the door or at the bedside of the sufferers and have every thing that was really of comfort in their habitations before any other man of the party thought of leaving company If for instance an apothecary was wanted he would arouse him in the middle of the night drag him out of bed or some way or other get him under his arm and if common necessaries were to be supplied he would run to his little  poorrascal's warehouse  as he used to call itand making up his bundle according to the case carry it in his hand and have done his work before his orders to an uninterested domestic could have been well given  CHAPTER II  PARTINGTON had been long in the habits of intimacy with Sir Armine and honoured the family with a liberal share of his  loving abuse whenever he made it a visit and each individual was as jealous of that abuse as desirous of his company The trio of brothers filled his scale of epithets James was only one of his middling sort of fellows John had the pleasure to be ranked his cursed goodfornothing caitiff and Henry enjoyed the supreme distinction of being almost the  first  of his damned insufferable scoundrels "Hark'ee you Mr middling sort of fellow" addressing himself to James after dinner "how goes on the affair between this damned insufferable scoundrel"here he shook Henry by the hand"and you know whoyou cursed goodfornothing little devil"tapping Olivia on the cheek"What say  you  you old rascal" added he turning to Sir Armine "are you getting your gouty legs in order to dance at the wedding 'Sbud man you ought upon that occasion to give us an hornpipe upon your stumps like Witherington for two such pretty caitiffs as these do not come together every day I can tell you But what are you all about you lazy vagabonds  shilly shally If I were a parson they should be married before I left the houseyoung folks can't begin to be happy too soonNow look how that insufferable poltroon" to Henry "shakes and trembleswhy one would think instead of feeling the flames of love on sitting so close to a fine girl whose telltale blushes ought to make him blaze out like a bonfire that the ague had got hold of him By the arm of my body he quivers like a Lapland witch Well come I will give him my blessing in a bumper However marry when they will may the pledges of their love be just as goodfornothing as their parents the girls abominable husseys and the boys damned insufferable scoundrels Put it round old Vulcan" said he pushing the bottle to Sir Armine he then stood up and sung some stanzas so replete with humour in themselves and in so quaint and ludicrous a manner that the whole company caught the hilarity of their worthy guest  "Was there ever such a comical creature" exclaimed Olivia smiling"But  hold what is this I hear about Henry's going to be hanged for his fine devil'sworks at the abbey"  Henry's confusion was now redoubled upon another account for he did not at all doubt but that the subject which had been remotely alluded to by John would be fully explained by this unqualifying son of the waves Henry winked nodded and made other signs of keeping silence which not only increased the curiosity of the company but made Partington more determined "I don't care for your wry faces a brass button you scoundrel" said he "I say notwithstanding all your antics you will come to the gallows'tis a serious matter to knock down a baronet on the very spot where he is to be buried then throw his daughter into fits and run away from both of them"  "Knock him down" said Olivia "Why good heavens if it had not been for Henry Sir Guise would have been murdered And as to Miss Stuart for whom my soul still bleeds her fits were occasioned God  knows by the loss of her sweet mother for as her brother could not attend Henry was her only comforter This is the whole of the matter I do assure you Mr Partington"  The earnest simplicity with which she uttered this in the defence and to the honour of him she loved and for whom she had always a vindication had a visible effect upon all but more particularly on Henry who torn betwixt the sensations of gratitude and shame tenderly caressed her  "You are both of you a couple of insufferable scoundrels and encourage one another For that matter I'd lay my life if this egregious villain"to Henry"  should  be hanged this dimpling caitiff would tie herself up in her garters the next morning that she might lovingly dangle by his side upon the same gibbet So as I hope yet to see them tied up together I think 'tis the best way to pinion them now till their time comes"Here he drew them close to his own bosom formed their arms into the wreathe of love and ordering the whole  party to follow their example conducted them into the garden  CHAPTER III  THUS were matters reinstated to the general satisfaction and even Henry felt it might have been much worse for though it had been so long the wish and endeavour of his heart to come to an explanation of its fatal secretany disclosure of it at such a time in such a place and under such circumstances would have been the most overwhelming event that could have happened to him  Partington who had the romping playfulness of a boy without the least of that mischief which usually attaches to the sport of youth continued his pleasantries amongst which was a proposition to run upon the greensward along the park with Henrythe winner to be intitled to a kiss from Olivia and Olivia herself to be the umpire  He pointed to a clump of elms as the  given distance the putting himself into a starting posture "ThereI'll give you law you villainso away with you" Henry was perhaps never less in disposition for a frolic but knowing that Partingtonwho had now doubled his fistswould have pushed him headlong forward had he suffered himself to be overtaken he soon sprung to the goal in doing which however he contrived to trip up Partington's heels to the no small diversion of the company "A bubble bet" cried Partington scrambling up "the race was obtained only by a fraud else I should have beat him hollowa contrived thing I saw both the villains laying their heads together concerting how it should be before I set off" The truth is he loitered behind while he counterfeited exertion purposely that the supposed lovers might be thrown into each other's arms  These sallies were interrupted by a knot of travellers who were passing that part of the park which sir Armine left free for the accommodation of the public  The wanderers had the attractions of indisputable  affliction and of sickness its too frequent attendant strongly impressed in their air looks and motions Yet there was no external appearance of want in any of the groupe all were habited neatly and one of them bore a wallet laden with food but the moment you beheld them your own heart would have told you they were destitute of comforts which were not to be found in that wallet There are certain signs and tokens of misery so visible in the human form and countenance that every man without an insult upon the human character and understanding must see and feel them at a glance  The groupe consisted of an elderly man leading a boy about twelve years olda woman something under the age of the man with a child at her backand a beautiful young woman who sad and sorrowing followed the rest As the first and last mentioned objects stood by the side of the venerable Fitzorton and the blooming Olivia they exhibited in striking contrast the wonderful difference which sickness and  health happiness and misery produce in beings of the same species and at the same period of life "Please your honours" said the old man respectfully "I hope we are not upon trespass here a man on the other side told us there was a footway here to the place we are going we have come clean from west to north and are somewhat footsore and every bit of ground saved therefore is something Our Jane here poor thing can hardly drag one foot afore t'other so as night is coming on and we are not acquainted with the country hereabouts mayhap your honours who I suppose are masters of thatun great house would be so kind to give us barnroom till the morning"To this Partington made answer "he was afraid the vagabonds had staid in their own parish till they were driven out of it bag and baggage and were living now by accident in a barn or a stable or the open field as they could manage it"The old man answered "Please your worship none of us have been ever a burthen to the parish yet and I hope with  the blessing of God upon our labour we sha'n't But we are burnt stick and stone out of our parish where we lived upon our earnings and a little matter besides for these forty years May be your honour would like to hear a little about us I am a mason your honourso I bought a bit of ground and built a house on him and furnished him a thing at a time and there 'twould have done your heart good to see how we lived till a sort of quarrel betwixt me and a great rich person who has an estate thereabout and has a house like a townwhere nobody lives for a constancy but a savage old servant or twofor the master only comes a week or two in the spring season or to gather rents when the steward who by the same token is worth a hundred of his master can't come down" "God bless his goodness" said the woman who appeared to be the mother of the family "if it had not been for  him  I do believe it would have been bad off for us long afore for the baronet was pecking and pecking at us years agone our Jerom  who is gone forward with the mule got himself made a freeholder and would not vote for a friend of this great baronight for he is one who is  'titled  to do as he likes with poor folk  bore  us all a grudge""And somehow or other your worship" resumed the old man "about August in the summer after I shut up house whilst I and dame and youngster went a making a little harvesting at friend Armstrong's a cousin of my wife's who has a bit of a farm and who wished me to bring all my family and as we could make ourselves tolerably tight and smart at that time we rigged ourselves out and off we went but when we got home from merrymakingwhat a world it is your worshipI saw the top of my house where the bottom should be and the walls as black as my hat""Why Reuben" exclaimed the wife "how can you be so milklivered and mealymouthed Reuben Please your worship as sure as you stand there this great baronet I told you about set it afire""O impossible" cried Olivia"Set it afire Miss I say" resumed  the wise emphatically slapping her hands together "and I'll tell him so to his head and bring all my ruinated family in my hand to  shew  him what he has done for we left neither fire nor candle and I'll take my affydavid that I put up the shutters and locked the door and clapt the key in our pockets and the same to the little garden gate and God knows the keys are all now we have for it here they are your worship aye and they shall go  with  us to the wicked wretch though all the keys in the world can't open his heart because it is harder than they but a' shall hear on't and if there is law in the land he shall ha' it" "Hold your tongue Sal" said the old man "I don't think Sir Devil'scome as we call him in our parts would go to set a man's house on fire when there wa'n't a soul in it either to please or to tease him or to say why do ye so though to be sure my house as I said is down and all that was in it burned or moved off and what was worse I had put into a drawer a little modukin of money shillings and half crowns at a time  now and then a golden guinea and they are gone too though I have been pottering about with my stick and my family have all been on their knees grubbing i' the ashes but it was all to no purpose This fellow would have gone to pot too" continued the old man pointing to a curltail black dog that followed him "and so would the kitten under our Jenny's arm there if we had not luckily put she to 'bide with Goody Brabson a neighbour of ours so here is the whole family your honour counting Jerom and Dorothy"Olivia who had before put a trifle into the young woman's hand now stroked the kitten and Henry long before the story had arrived at this stage had made his offering James patted the dog called him a lucky fellow and assured him considering such dangers he had a very narrow escape At the suggestion of the house being maliciously set on fire every particle of blood that supplied the body of Partington flew in his face he cried out "O that the worthy baronet had been in the middle of the flames I would have set fire to my  own house to have had him in the centre but I don't believe a word on't it's a lye it must be a lye I  will have  it a lye Are you sure fellow you did not see it on fire  yourself  And why do you keep that child woman swinging at your back all this time when there is such a fine soft bank by the side of you and the grass full of flowers and as dry as my walkingstick" Here Partington loosed the bandages took the infant in his arms repeating "Answer me that answer me that down with ye down with every oneyou two old sinners in particular"Partington appearing to bend them to the ground forcibly but in truth lowering them with all possible gentleness "As for you" continued he "good people" addressing himself to his own party "the evening begins to draw in the dew falls see how your fine neckcloths and handkerchiefs shrink at itsunflowers can bear nothing but fair weatherthe dew won't suit your gouty limbs you old scoundrel"to Sir Armine"nor your delicate ancles Mrs Abominable"to Olivia"the  vagabonds  may remain they are used to clouds and so in with the family you blubbering waterheaded rascal"to Henry He spake this as in rebuke though by the bye his own face was covered with tears"Pack off I say I will have it so I'll be with you presentlybut you are to know that I smoke a damned lye all through this business and I am determined to have it out with the ragamuffins and I don't doubt but I shall have the satisfaction of seeing every one of them sent to the house of correction and that I shall bring them to old Armine here to make out their mittimus" All this time they had been moving or rather Partington had been pushing them forwards and as the Clares and Fitzortons knew the poor creatures would be left in good hands they bent their steps back towards the castle  CHAPTER IV  "GOOD heaven" exclaimed Olivia to her father as the party were walking home "do you think there ever was such a shocking thing done in the world as for a person to set fire to his neighbour's house on purpose I have read of such horrid actions in newspapers and once I think in a book but never believed either to be possible indeed I felt a kind of disgust at the author of such incredible fictions"  "It is almost a sin my sweet girl" said Mr Clare "to destroy your opinion of human kind formed on the basis of your own innocence Painful as it is to oppose the wisdom of experience to the blissful simplicity of a pure and unpractised heartI have known more instances than one of it"  "Yet we seldomI never did" resumed Olivia "hear of people coming to an untimely end for these horrid crimes""That too is amongst the vices of the times" rejoined Sir Armine "People make their fortunes  nowadays by being  ruined and undone  In a few months after these  lucky misfortunes  we behold new trades carried on by those who had been turned pennyless out of their shops and we see new houses rising like so many phoenixes out of the ashes of the old"  "My dear girl" cried her father "who can detail the history of modern inventions in the art of livingThere is comparatively a poor livelihood child now to be picked up out of the real miseries of life but luxury and independence pour in their stores on the designingthus some impositions are a decent maintenance and others a very comfortable sinecure in short to make  fictitious distress  the instrument of  real good fortune  is amongst the most dextrous refinements of this improving age vice is always at work and works with the greatest success on the sensibility of virtue"  "Dreadful" exclaimed Olivia "But I cannot think the poor creatures we have just left are of this description for surely that old miserable man who asked for nothing  but the charity of a bed of straw in our barn could not trump up such a falsehood against the person he spoke ofand indeed I have blamed myself every step I have come that I did not beg my dearest Sir Armine to let him have some comfortable place to rest his family tonightthe young woman really looked ready to sink into the earth with fatigue and yet she kept the poor kitten in her arms and I heard her ask her mother to let her carry the child twenty timesIndeed indeed Mr Partington judges too harshly of them Gracious heaven Henry if the world is half so wicked as you and your brother John have painted it to me I do not see how such a simpleton as your Olivia is to live in it"  Here the lovely girl ran to Henry and placing herself betwixt him her own father and Sir Armine she said in a tone that might have taught hypocrisy to forego its victim "Well thank God while I am thus protected not all the bad people in the world can do me any harm" saying which she entwined her arms and clung  towards her parent and lover as if she felt herself in a sanctuary  "But" said James with his usual good sense and moderation "the miseries of human life induced by  inevitable  misfortunes are alas so manifold and so various that the soul is not to be frozen up because vice can assume the appearance of virtue in distress and by applying to the same source may partake of the same bountiful stream"  "Respecting the wretched family we have been talking with" said Henry "we have all seen they are both sick and sorrowful my dearest father and I dare pledge myself every tittle of their story is true""Truth may perhaps lie between" interposed James"I would go barefoot a thousand leagues" exclaimed Henry "to punish the author of their ruin but if having found him he was evidently under the pressure of any heartwringing misery pining with want or wasting in disease I hope I should do what I could to comfort him""It is certainly right" said James half conceding "to take care that vice does not run  away with the perquisite of virtue but it is nevertheless better that they should divide our bounty than that from sear of encouraging the one we should refuse to reward the other"  "The virtue of designing well" said Sir Armine with a deciding voice as he reached the portico of the castle "if it fails of some is seldom deprived of all its rewardsLet the honourable passions and emotions of our frame declare the unrivalled privileges of a gentle and unsuspicious heartlet the power which it gives us in the energies of our loves and friendships pronounce its eulogylet pity charity candour benevolence easiness to believe the best and tardiness to credit the worstyea and the sweet very sweet simplicity that sometimes conducts us to the precipice down which we are hurled by the villain guidelet even the pure and innocent heart itself through all its meanders of sensibilitylet it in vibrations of transport declare it is the prime delight of man and the choicest gift of God"  Olivia here pressed the hand of her father then that of Sir Armine upon her heart "You have now all settled it so entirely to my satisfaction and have brought me again into such good humour with that world which some of you had almost put me out of conceit with that I will not stay to hear another word"The whole company went into the house  Chapter V  "IT is among the wonders of the world when I wonder" quoth Partington to the family in the park "and yet I must confess the audaciousness of your telling that impudent lye about some worthy gentleman's burning down your house because you would not vote against your conscience does throw even me into astonishment""Sir" answered the old man with some dignity "I do not pretend to say it is so for sartain but Goody Brabson is ready to swear it for she was disturbed the night before and saw illlooking fellows lurking about  and before that day comeweek my house was downbut as for a lye I don't know whether I would tell one to have it built  up  again""No" answered Partington"then give me your hand you scoundrel""But for that matter" resumed the old man "there are hotter doings at electioneering than burning down poor men's housesWhy bless your worship I have seen the candidates as they call themselves ready to set fire to one another""Aye your honour" interposed the old man's wife "that's not half the mischief there was something worse than 'lection riots in this affairnaughty Jenny there and this poor brat at my back if it could speak could tell you all about that"Here the young woman whom she called Jenny made signs for her mother to keep silence upon which the mother exclaimed "Hussy I will speak his honour here shall know who are scoundrels and who are not Mayhap his honour is a justice of the peace and will give us some lawAn' please your worship that baronet is the father of this babe after my  Reuben had refused his vote this baronet grew so kind that we thought God help us he repented his  hashness  to us whereupon I was a kind of a charwoman now and then at the great house when he came down for a week or two and if I was wanted at home why I sent Jenny there backwards and forwards as well spoken and likesome a girl your honour aye and as shamefaced then and for that matter now tho' she has had a bastard as any she of the countryand so behold ye' this villain of a baronet was only kind for the sake of she and behold ye he contrived to get to the sight and speech of her and soon put the girl aside herself she could talk of nothing but the baronetthe baronet told her thisthe baronet gave her thatI believe in my conscience he turned her silly head and overset her in such a way that she was crazy enough to think of becoming my ladyaye and he put a new golden ring on her finger and called her wifethough he was married before and they do say to a  moral  of a womannot that he ever brought maddam downand he persuaded  silly Jane she was deadthof a maddam he had there too and there she comes at times still for a month in the summer and says she's the baronet's cozenmarry come up a dainty cozen I warrant she cozens his virtuous wife finely But to return to our JenneyReuben and I began to think it odd the girl should get so much into favour seeing how we were hated before but we still were fools enough to believe that Sir Guise "  "Sir Guise" exclaimed Partington "is  he  the baronet It's all trueget uptell the rest of your story as you go along I see you are a pack of sad scoundrels and I shall insist upon Fitzorton's house covering all of you somewhere until morning And do you hear girlJane I think is your namedo you lean on my arm and do you mother Blab take hold of the other armyou young varlet keep close by your fatherhussy keep you by your motherbut as to the suckling you must carry that sin yourself Jane for the devil seduce me if I touch any thing belonging to that pretty gentleman  unless I should have the felicity of tucking him up under the gallows Well but that happy day may come yet"  Partington had the family all up on the march before he had got to the ejaculation with which he finished his harangueand disposed the several persons in the order described In this manner they were moving along towards the castle when they encountered Henry who partly in consequence of Olivia's whisper and partly to gratify his own curiosityor perhaps from a better principlewas returning to the spot where he left the groupe Without relating stories or entering into causes Partington ordered Henry to run as fast as his legs would carry him back to the castle order a comfortable supper but not among the servants and half a dozen well aired beds and tell old squaretoes it was his command"Nay that 'tis the old caitiff's duty" said he "for here is justice business enough for a whole sessions and moreover if he don't chuse to accommodate them come back again and tell me so that I may  take them to the Fitzortonarms public house for they shall not go out of my custody till I sift the affair to the bottom and as it's moonlight a mile or two more less for good suppers and good beds can make little difference"Henry who was ever ready to assist the unfortunate without paining them by a recital of distressful stories hasted without asking a single question to execute his commission  Partington returned to the travellers who began to think him insane and put himself nearly in his former situation with the difference only of taking the child gently from the young woman who had been giving it suck and saying at the same time "Come as that little rascal may one day be brought in evidence against its virtuous father I think I will give it a lift and so go on with your walk and your story old caitiff"  "As I was saying then your worship we foolishly thought Sir Guise Stuart" "Proceed" cried Partington "if you can without any more mentioning that worthy  gentleman's name for it puts me in a fever call himcall himbaronet"  "The baronet then" answered Mrs Atwood "was never easy but when some of us was at the great house he wanted Reuben to give up masonrywe staid in the parish a twelvemonth after the fire with Goody Brabsonthe baronet wished us to take one of his farmssometimes he said he would pull down the great house and build up a finer which would do for his son when he married and give Reuben the job and as for Jenny I don't know what he was to do for shehe would take her to his other great seat in these partsI never was there your honour but I  will  be there and sooner than he thinksWell he would pull this other down and let her live with missmiss Carolineso we e'en let her go and coil enough there was about it from Reuben who had been told by neighbours what would become of it however I thought it for the best and away she went"  "Accursed be the hour she did" said Reuben  "Don't interrupt her you vagabond" cried Partington doubling his fistsnot at Reuben however nor at any person present  "The upshot of it was an' please your worship that one Valentine Miles a man that used to do all Sir Guise'sI beg your honour's pardon I meanthethebaronet's dirty work such as pounding our strays suing for rents and the likeMiles I say your honour took Jane as he said to Guise Abbey but in fact far enough afield from that he carried her up to London always calling her my ladyand as the foolish girl was in love she believed it and for that matter she lived like a lady sure enoughlady's maids lady's liverymen and what notno wonder your worship poor Jane believed it all gospel for I thought it so myselffor  a'ter  this he had her married over again but that was sham too just like the ring business  afore  for the fellow who married her was as little of a parson and as great a rogue as himselfso your worship sees the end on'tthis poor boy"  "Whew" whistled Partington"And we might have lived in ignorance and she in wickedness poor thing a great while longer" continued the afflicted father caressing his betrayed daughter "had not somebody sent us a  nonmus  letter as they call it saying our daughter was a double U Sir Guise Stuart an Rand the child a B"  Partington here gave the old mason another shake by the hand and then bade the wife proceed  She then related a variety of other heinous particulars unfolding the villany of Sir Guise and his agents and ending with the recovery of the deluded Jenny to the arms of her family "Yes your honour" said Mrs Atwood in conclusion"and so this very day was six weeks brought Jenny and her brat home to us again dressed in the very gown she went away ina good stuff of  our own honest buying  and which she has got on you see at this presentBut with the blessing upon us we'll make the baronet ashamed of it yet for we are going  to settle not passing more than thirteen or fourteen miles on t'other side of his abbey and we have come a matter of that about purposely to tell him a piece of our mind and if your worship can do any thing in this affair give us some justice for we'll have none of his money so far contrary indeed that one of the mule's paniers with Jerom is loaded with all the thingssome of 'em pretty smart ones toothat he gave us before Jenny went from usAs to the fine clothes and trinkumtrankums he gave she they were all left behind at the wicked place where we found her"  Their walk and their recital ended together for they had now arrived at the castle where they were again met by Henry who told Partington all things would be done as he had directed"Then lead the way" said Partington "for these are much greater vagabonds than you think and must be taken care of accordingly"  Henry conducted them to a large apartment adjoining the steward'sPartington ushered them in ordered the servant to  place chairsassisted in the business himself observing that "though they were vagabonds they were every one to be treated with the utmost respect"He desired them to eat drink and be merryto be in good humour with one another but above all things not to say a single cross word to that goodfornothing hussy Jane and to take care that the child had some pap  CHAPTER VI  HENRY and Partington returned to the company where Olivia was still presiding at the teatable declaring Mr Partington should not go without his usual beverage This was a pint bason filled with tea and milk and honey in equal proportions "If you would not have me choaked with rage give me the  slop  "so he always called itand seeing the bason before him he spilled one part of it and swallowed the other then taking breath he threw himself into a chair the blood starting into his face while he recited the history of the Atwoods  making no other variations than distinguishing Sir Guise by the words "fine fellow pretty gentleman the hero of the tale" But though thesee pithets were not bitter in language they were intolerably so in the manner of their delivery for at the mention of his atrocities he would sometimes leap up take the room at a couple of strides exclaiming to a chair to a table to one of the company or even to his own shadow in the glass supposing it were Sir Guise "Your most obedient very humble servant my noble baronet I trust your execution is not very far off for other facts are coming out I dare say and all the crimes of human nature will conduct your honour to Tyburn I flatter myself Would to heaven they could all be bundled with you into the same cart that you might be put out of the world together I would empty my cellaraye and almost my strong box tooto celebrate that glorious event"  The effect which the narration had upon the company was various Lady Fitzorton lifted up her hands and wept silentlyMr  Clare exclaimed "Execrable wretch" Sir Armine knit his brows and said "Poor Charles what does he not deserve to atone for the curse of such a parent"Olivia said "The poor girl and child deserved every care that innocence betrayed and helpless infancy could receive from pity""These old caitiffs too have their merits" cried Partington "But what can be a sufficient tribute of admiration for Miss Stuart" exclaimed Olivia"so good so considerate how my dear Henry shall we do honour to her"Henry held his tongue and spake nothing yet looked as if he subscribed fully to the eulogy  Partington however was the most busy of the groupe His hands head and heart seemed to be full and he divided the evening between his insufferable scoundrels above stairs and his abominable vagabonds below  Olivia too frequently stole out and whispering Henry who always disappeared soon after hasted to Partington's guests and under pretence of asking if they had every  thing comfortable about them took occasion to shew many little marks of a generous nature and of genuine goodwill  She had particularly directed her own maid to provide all things proper for the child and would have sent to the manorhouse for her own cradle but was prevented by Henry who reminded her there were several in the castle"Gracious perhaps your ownwhat an honour if we could procure that" exclaimed Olivia "the poor babe is innocent you know alas and its mother can scarcely be called guilty my Henry"She took care that a comfortable change of every thing was provided from her own wardrobe and placed ready for Jane Atwood in her bedchamber nor was she unmindful of the rest in such little additions as might be proper to the general happiness  Prior again to this true George had been dispatched by Partington to the eastern gate of the park at which Atwood's eldest son Jerom with Dorothy was appointed to wait his family's joining him"The boy  will stand stock at the gate please your worship" said old Atwood as he overheard Partington giving directions "he  said  he would thof it were for a couple of nights I never see'd such a boy for that bid 'un do a thing and if he answers 'Aye' the thing's done but then again if he gives you one of his  noes  i'cod your worship he's more of a mule than Dorothy"  "I see into the vagabond's character at once" replied Partington "Go then George you will find him stuck to the gate and if he won't leave it take Armine's team and bring gate and all"  True George when he had a goodnatured thing to do never addicted himself to unnecessary delays and was besides one of the most active young fellows in the world He set off therefore for the eastern gate as if his own bed and board depended on his dispatch  To confess the truth this honest fellow had been more in the secrets of Atwood's family than any other of the servants Indeed he was a youth of most insatiable curiosity  where the gratification thereof had but the probable aspect of being attended by a good office in searching after which he was indefatigable And judging from his beloved master Henry's second visit to the park by moonlight too that some new adventure was near he had contrived to take his usual station of an outpost for fear of being discovered By a little  bush  fighting however which is extremely honourable he formed his ambuscade behind some flowering thorns which grew in that part of the park where Mr Partington recapitulated in an audible voice so much of the Atwoods' story as had then been told  CHAPTER VII  WERE it our intention to give to each of the heroes and heroines of this epic history a day of prowess after the manner of the great Maeonides who dedicated one book of his Iliad to Ajax another to Agamemnon and so onwe should certainly consecrate this chapter to the achievements  of Olivia who from the orient sun even to his downgoing and again to his uprising was employed in doing at least as much good as any illustrious ancient or modern whom fable or truth has yet celebrated were we to begin with Philip of Macedon and end with Frederick of Prussia and we do not at all deem it unreasonable to declare that we expect the very abridgment of her acts during the abovementioned space will make the reader more in love with her though rehearsed in humble prose than if in imitation of those royal butchers she had laid a thousand of her fellow creatures with her own hand dead at her feet in the field of battle  The day then of the fair Olivia Clare was ushered in by an act mild and lovely as the first ray of the morn which shone on iteven by an early walk round the garden with the unfortunate Jane Atwood Luckless victim thy modest appearance and blushing graces and all the deep regrets of downcast consciousness streaming from thy eyes thy keen sense of the  novelty  of a virtuous  woman soothing and not aggravating the fate of a woman betrayedjustified thy mother's description and made the compassion and loving kindness of thy protectress a virtue worthy to be imitated by thy sex a sex too often cruel and unrelenting to most pitiable victimsAfter several turns about the walks Olivia conducted her still trembling proteg√©e to the breakfastroom where the Atwoods had been invited by Sir Armine to join the family but seeming to feel themselves farther from home there than in the apartment where they had passed the preceding evening they were again committed to the care of Partington and true George  Olivia understanding this begged permission to seat Jane between Henry and herself saying in a whisper to her father "Because you know we can comfort and make her chearful" Besides the shyness which only an intercourse with the world can remove a painful consciousness of her error and of the knowledge which the company had of it made the timid Jane discover so much uneasiness  that the goodnatured Olivia perceiving it led her first to the window and then out at the door saying "her young friend was not very well and though sensible of the honour intended her wished to take breakfast with her own family" Partington's proposal to blend the Atwoods and Fitzortons at breakfast was amongst the generous little inconsistencies or rather indiscriminations which were interwoven into his character insomuch that you would sometimes see at his table persons whom from their difference of character and condition any man who attended to the ceremonies of the world and indeed to the distinctions of ranks in society would have thought it impossible he could bring together But the same objection by no means held against the propriety of Olivia bringing this young woman into so much good companythe best and most justifiable motives influenced the fair protectress and there was a natural grace and gentility about the no less fair protected which Sir Guise in giving her the best masters had not a little improved In truth  Jane attributed her misfortune and all its fatal consequences to the violence of the baronet's passion for her and she looked on the mock nuptials as so solemn a pledge of his love that she herself encouraged the wish of Sir Guise that the union should remain secret from an idea which sprung from the purity of her affection that having the joy to tell her own heart he was her wedded lord she had rather continue to be thought herself dishonoured than that he should be degraded Her father's finding and carrying her off she long considered as the sole cause by which she had been separated from the baronetand although none of these motives wholly obliterated the inward sense of her first indiscretion prior to her supposed honourable union or suppressed the sigh so often as she turned her thoughts towards her deserted father and his familyshe cheared herself by reflecting that if ever she should qualify herself so as to justify Sir Guise in owning her as his lawful lady all would still be well Inspired by the expectation of such a rewardshe applied with  unwearied diligence to whatever might render her more attracting in manners and cultured in mindHer grand object in attempting the adornment of both was to deserve the honour which she believed Sir Guise had conferred on her and to enable him to acknowledge her with less comparative disgrace and as the baronet sometimes found relief in her gentleness from the violence of Mrs Tempest and the disturbance of his thoughts on his usage to the real Lady Stuarthis kind treatment of her made her still lay much of his deception to his fear of losing her by a discovery of the truth and although her parents more especially her mother never uttered his name without annexing to it a curseshe acknowledged to Olivia in the garden that although she too well knew she had herself acted very wrong she did not believe he was half so bad as people represented him "This I must say though except we happen to meet with him at home this morning I must never hope and indeed I do notdedesire that isI do not  ought  to desire ever  to see him more""This morning child" questioned Olivia "what do you mean" "Yes madam my father and mother and my brother Jerom are determined to see him andand Jerom swore on his knees But what good can it do madam to drag me before his family And then my brother is so passionateIf indeed Sir Guise could be sent for to any other place but his own houseandandtalkedtoabout me or about the poor childor ififIif II"  Here grief awhile choaked her utterance "Not that my father" added she "would suffer either of us to receive another farthing of his money he would sooner work his poor fingers to the bone nay all which Jerom has in one of those great panniers are presents sent by Sir Guise or myself from town since I imagined alas myself and assured them I was his sacred though secret wife and my father and brother have worked night and day for these four months pastindeed ever since they knew of my disappointmentand almost starved themselves  to save up the money they have received that they may throw it back to the baronetthough if any thing should happen to my brother or to my father oror ortoanybodyelseI know not what would become of me Would I were dead miss I am a wicked girl and have no right to live bringing the grey hairs of my poor father and mother to the grave You do not know how they are alteredthey are not like the same people since they heard of my misfortunethough they have not given me one harsh word since I came home yet I cannot curse poor Sir Guise as they doindeed I cannot pray forgive me miss I tried to make him love meindeed I didI shall never see him again so I do not speak on that account but were he as much to blame as myself I had rather die than be the death ofofofanybody in the world much less the father ofmy mypray forgive meyet I would to heaven some kindhearted person though I know I do not deserve it would try to persuade my father from going to the abbey  Would to heaven Miss Caroline Stuart did but know or that I could any way get a letter to her I have one ready written I am sure  she  would contriveO miss you do not know what an angel she isnot that I ever saw her but oncebut that once I shall never forget itshe almost broke my heartone Mr Dennison the baronet's steward whom we sometimes saw at Clare Place brought her unawares to my lodgings when he knew his master was gone a journey then it was that she told me if I would return home to my poor father and make my family a visit and then find some excuse to stay with them without letting any body else know of it except Mr Dennison she would take all the care of the child to herself nurse and provide for it as her own and that she would promise I should not only hear about its welfare but contrive now and then to let me see it by means of Mr Dennison and none of my family being let into the secret and that as to Sir Guise said the sweet young lady except yourself miss I never saw her equal  either in goodness or in beautyit will be easy for us to manage matters with him for you know Jane continued she he must at times be as grieved as yourself for the injury you are both of you doing to the most affectionate wife in the whole world Then it was I first discovered his former marriage and on authority alas I could not disbelieve She saw the agonies into which the information threw me and tried to sooth themah why are not all good people all virtuous ladies so mild as her when they speak toto unhappy women Sure the gentle accent would have more proselytes than the stern rebukeWhat an atonement it will beexclaimed the angel daughter of the unfortunate Sir Guise what an atonement Jane for the wrongs you have done my poor mother who is both in spirits and health a sufferer if youwho were so often the unknown cause though I own an unconscious one of her husband's estrangement and absence from home should also be the secret cause of his return to her I am sure I as his child shall be  bound to pray for you during my whole life and shall look upon the attentions I shew this poor little thingmy child you must know was then continued the weeping Jane asleep in the cradle just by meI say I shall look upon the attention paid to your babe Jenny as part of the gratitude I owe the mother for the amiable consideration shewn for my own parent and indeed your merit my good girlshe called me so miss though I did not deserve itwill be much greater than mine on this occasion for you perhaps will sacrifice a strong though an improper passion to a much superior principle and I shall be but an humble instrument to reward you for so doing But your reward Jenny will be much greater and administered to you by an infinitely higher power whose forgiveness of the past will be accompanied by eternal happiness in futureHere miss the sweet lady took my child in her arms and kissed it several times and putting it again into the cradle saidYes and this dear little thing too shall honour its mother the first words I  will teach it to lisp shall be  bless my mother  for all her goodness If you consent to this JennyDennison and I will devise some means for you to have the child properly disposed of when you go into the country and it will be as true as easy for you to say you know a person who will take care of the infant till you come backThen taking my hand and again kissing my poor little one she went down with Mr Dennison who wept as he assured Miss Caroline that my infantwas like thetheII Iforget what missbut something about its likeness to Sir GuiseI often thought there was a resemblanceand I am sure I could not but kiss the hand of good Mr Dennison for what he said about itpray forgive me madam  "But all Miss Stuart's intended kindness was put a stop to by a wicked woman Mrs Tempestand a tempest she is by name and by naturewho ferreted me out and called me all manner of names I deserved them indeed she pulled the hair from my head by handfuls before his face  she made him promise I should go away from him before she would quit the house and after repeating all the shocking names she had before made use of and cursing me several times for she swore terribly she threw herself out at the door declaring she would be the death of us both if her own soul was the forfeit unless he brought her word I had left the lodgings never to return so that you see Sir Guise was forced into that he did yet I thought on what his good daughter had said to me though it was no time to make him more wretched by my reproaches or speak of the fatal truths which had been told to me But I was going to send my father word if he would receive me I would return home and never see the baronet morewhen my father himself and my cousin Jonathan entered the room while Sir Guise was there they found mewith my hair dishevelled and every part of my dress in disorder which led them to suppose that Sir Guise who looked no less terrified than myself had been beating of me for it was just after Mrs Tempest  had gone away But I never breathed the name either of good Mr Dennison or his young lady to Sir Guise or to Mrs Tempest so that they cannot come to any harm on my accountthere's some comfort in that"  Here the tender and afflicted Jane talked to the infant kissed and wept over it while Olivia experienced strong emotions of grief love and admiration as well for the friend of her infancy Miss Stuart as for the mother and the child  CHAPTER VIII  UPON the return of Olivia to the breakfasting parlour which was immediately after she had placed Jenny more at her ease with her own family she seated herself even though her beloved Henry was in the room between Mr Clare and Sir Armine and in that situation recapitulated with great fidelitybut with many comments and illustrations supplied from that rich repository her own good mindall that had passed between  her and the humble companion of her walk Both the old gentlemen were much affected and experienced in their turn the sensations though perhaps in a less vivid degree which had before been felt by Olivia nor were those of Lady Fitzorton who had a very tender disposition less animated But what shall be said of the emotions of Henry especially at the passages that depicted the virtue of Caroline Stuart on whom Olivia passed an eulogy that would not have been unworthy of Henry himself regretting at every sentence that the friendship formed between them in childhood had ever been destroyed  We must in truth leave this matter as we have done many others to the reader's own imaginationIf he has been or is a lover he will not be at a loss to conjecture if he has not he may be still able faintly to judge what a young man of an ardent temper and under Henry's circumstances would be likely to feel on such an occasion  Be it noted also to the honour of Olivia  that in her recital she sunk upon her little auditory probably in consideration of Henry's friendship for Charles Stuart as many of the indefensible parts of the baronet's conduct as she could or rather she gave to truth its most candid form At this moment Partington entered the room took a chair and sat thoughtfully down "To let the Atwoods meet the Stuarts you know" said Olivia addressing herself to Lady Fitzorton and looking at the old gentlemen "would be little short of actual madness at least till matters are in better train and to allow them to take possession of the cottage they mentioned just at present while left to the guidance of their own resentments would be as bad Suppose then"here she had a long whisper with her father at the end of which she sprung up and running to Henry asked him if he was disposed for a walk to the poor deserted manorhouse that fine morning"My father" said she "has given me a commission which must be executed immediately"  Henry was rising to attend her when  Partington getting up cried out "Hold hold you little villain I see you and your old scoundrel of a father are upon some scheme to trick me out of my vagabonds but it won't doI have settled the whole business They are getting ready to go with me and I have ordered your little messagecart Armine to come in tow of  my  chaise and I had a good mind to have ordered your chaise into the bargain"  "And you might have done so" said Sir Armine warmly"and my coach too" "And  my  curricle" cried Olivia putting on her cloak"And  all  our carriages" added Mr Clare"but then you must not cheat my poor Olivia out of her share of the AtwoodsShe tells me the eldest daughter is to succeed the foolish young woman who is marrying off""O" exclaimed Olivia "I cannot do without dear Janeshe is the only woman in the world to replace Lucy and her child will be no hindrance and the manorhouse is really catching cold for want of companyYou know my dear Lady Fitzorton you never let us live any  where but with you at the castleand we are ten times greater vagabonds as Mr Partington calls them than any of the Atwoods So do not interfere with my part of the property pray Mr Insufferable"  "Be it soyou are a sad fellow though" answered Partington"but as that is the case my chaise and the cart will doI have sent the caitiff true George after Jerom and his Dorothy as he calls herand I will go before upon one of your horses not your madcap Bucephalus though Henry you have taught him some of your poetical flightsOd's pranks the highmettled rascal would throw Apolloone would think he was making Pindarics while mere mortal man was upon his back No no James's evengoing pad for me" "Order white Surry for the field tomorrow" quoth Henry sportingly"But whither" demanded Lady Fitzorton"are you going to carry the good folks"  "To where all vagabonds ought to be carried to a place of safetyso don't ask any  more questionslook to the hussy and her brat who are to go into your custody"  "But shall we not"resumed Lady Fitzorton "see them again before they go I have not seen any but the eldest daughter and her infant yet"  "No" answered Partington"no leavetakings The people are sick and sorry and as to gratitude and all that time enough to settle these matters when our work is done We are officers of  justice  you know and of course are responsible for our prisoners  "Meantime it is easy to  suppose  the men and boys have made their bows and the women and girls dropt their curtsies I hate blushing and blubberingso good bye to youI hear the carriages wheeling round aye and there I see steps on Steady your youngest villain Armine is leading himI shall have the vagabonds come whimpering if I do not stop themNot a step therefore on your lives you scoundrels till we have got through the park"  "But promise me"said Olivia following Partington to the door"you will leave  my  property I ought to go and settle that matter myself"  "Settle nonsense" cried Partington "I'll tell the girl she and her child are to be put into prison by you instead of me"  "Oh but another thing" said Olivia "I would not have you go to the abbey nor within sight of it for the worldyou know not what may be the consequence GraciousMr Partington you are the best man in the world  almost  butbutare so precipitateso"  "Did you ever hear such a saucy vexatious talkative prittleprattle insolent insufferable scoundrel since you were born" cried Partington taking her hand and kissing it"Why you little impertinent villain do you pretend to instruct an old rascal like me where I am to go and what I am to doDo I ask how you intend to dispose of your share of the ragamuffins whether strangling shooting or only whipping is to be their portionAs  to the abbey do you suppose I will carry such a set of abominables before the worthy gentleman"here he took off his hat and bowed respectfully"who has been so kind to them till they are in a proper condition to bring him to the gibbetBut you have kept me talking here while I could have got with my whole crew almost halfway to my journey's endso ask no questions stay all of you in this room without ringing the bell twenty minutes by Olivia's watch and so God mend you all"  Saying this he opened the door and meeting Henry he thrust him into the room also crying out "God mend you  too  you scoundrel"then locking the door gave the key to one of the servants "Here sirrah if you let them out before the expiration of twenty minutes by the click of that pendulum opposite to which I now station you"pointing to the castle clock "I'll anatomize younay more I will have an hole dug chin deep in the very spot where I now place youand turning you into a sundial with a brass plate nailed to  your head make you learn to keep time for the rest of your lifeStay here comes Georgeyou are released sirrahthis rascal will serve my purpose betterHere Mr Scoundrel" said Partington"twenty minutes to a moment keep this key then open that doorand have an eye to the windows too but as I know you to be a thoroughpaced villain and therefore to be depended onyou may move about a little just to stretch your legs"  Partington mounted Steady after a short conference with Jerom and his mule who now came uppacked the Atwoods into the carriagesand George took his station  CHAPTER IX  THE Clares and Fitzortons had too sincere a veneration for the virtues of this excellent man not to let him conduct them in his own way  Sir Armine and Lady Fitzorton could not  however but smile at the conceit of their own castle being converted into a jail and one of their own servants into the jailor and they were puzzling themselves to know in whose custody they were placed when a voice which they knew to be that of true George addressed them through the keyhole  "Pray my ladies and gentlemen don't be angryI hope you will be pleased to be shut up for as long a time as Mr Partington has orderednot that I mind being  'natomised  a pin's pointbut says he you are a scoundrel of honour Georgethis was in a whispershaking my hand at the same timeyour worship knows his way So I am sorry I can't let you out my ladies and gentlemen but I know if I did he would never call me a scoundrel again though mayhap I should be more of a scoundrel then than I am nowThe time will soon be gone fourteen minutes and almost a half nowThey say time has wings but I think I never knew him creep so slow in my lifeI wish I could tell you any pretty story or sing a good  song or do any thing to keep your honours in spirits while you are my prisoners As for that had your honours been confined in a dark room you would have been better off than poor me or Mr Partington eitherfor there was such kissing and crying with the old folks on leaving Jenny and her child behindand Jenny I believe is hardly out of her fits yet""In fits" answered Olivia"let me out this instant norun and tell herI will be with her in avery few minutes""I can't go to tell her miss though I had rather be in fits myself than sheyet I mayn't budge till my time is out"  Among the other good qualities of George he had one well worthy the adoption of all his partycoloured brethrento wit that simple but rare property of doing what he was ordered  "But here she comes with the child in her arms and the tears all about her pretty facenow I can tell her missnay for that matter in about another minute and three quarters you may tell her yourself"  Here he entered into a short conversation with Janelooking alternately at her and at his watchthen he exclaimed"Huzza Huzzathe time's out the time's out"and he vaulted in the air as if he himself had gained his freedom after years of slaveryHe unlocked the door entered the room and entreated their honours' pardon on receiving which he went comforted awayOlivia hasted to her charge Henry was about to take his share in the business when his father requested him to stop a few moments as he had something to communicate to which the presence of his mother and their mutual friend Mr Clare could be no objectionbeing indeed parties concerned "No" added he recollecting himself"it will do rather better tomorrow morningI forgot a few points which I have to adjust previously with  you  my dear ClareTomorrow morning then Henry we will have our conference the result of which I trust will be as perfect happiness to you as can be expected in a world like this"  Henry stood irresolute whether to speak or notand while he was balancing Olivia came back light as the gossamer and said to him in undeniable accents"Now then for our walk to the manorhouse and Jenny Atwood will be of our party the air will do her goodand besides she will be wantedor if she should be fatigued my good papa has commanded me to take the coach going and coming if necessary and why should not dear Jane and you and I Henry have an airing this morning as well as the rest of the Atwoods and Mr PartingtonWe will be back by dinnertime sir"added she to her fatherand then distributing to the rest of the family her little caresses with a grace perfectly her own as she always did before she went out she took her Henry's arm and as Jenny Atwood modestly declined the carriage they all three walked through the park of Fitzorton and to the manorhouse of Clare  CHAPTER X  THIS little excursion was productive of an event which had well nigh brought about that very explanation which Henry had so long desired yet dreaded should take place  Olivia had at this first setting out arranged Jane Atwood between Henry and herselfeach insisting upon taking an arm but soon after Olivia made a little alteration by putting herself in Jenny's place declaring "That she was resolved to have the charge all to herself" Whether this was the whole or only in part the reason for the change it is impossible for us to say but it was that which she thought fit to assign and there was no time to dispute it for just as the trio had gained an eminence in Mr Clare's park Jenny was led by curiosity or some other motive to ask "Whether the fine seat to the right did not belong toto to"  Perceiving her faulter Olivia relieved her by saying "Yes that is the abbey but we shall have a better view of it presently yet the manorhouse will be quite jealous if you give the preference Jane to the abbey"  Henry suppressed a sigh as he directed his view to the latter  "And I suppose then that forest" resumed Jane with increased emotion "isisis the one I have heardsoso much about"  "You are right" answered Olivia "those are the abbey woodsbut I would have you to know our dear little groves and shrubberies will supply you with more fragrant flowers and enchanting walksdo not you think so Henry"  Jane appearing faint Olivia proposed resting a few minutes in one of the small alcoves Hither they repairedJenny and Henry sat on the same benchperhaps by accident or out of respect to Olivia for they left to her one which commanded an extensive prospect whereas theirs had nothing to recommend it but an indistinct view  of the abbey and a skirt of its forestOlivia did not profit by this mark of their politeness rather preferring a seat on the same benchand no doubt by a like chance or compliment thinking she had sufficiently asserted her claims placed herself by the side of Henryalmost in the next instant her attention was drawn to some pencillings on the opposite pannel of the wainscot she rose to read themHenry impelled by a sudden recollection caught her gown and gently drawing her towards him she again sat down without in the least suspecting there was any other motive in the mind of Henry than that which to her own was the most delightfulthe sweet thought of Henryand she would have left the alcove without perhaps thinking of her former intention had not Jane Atwood as she was going out exclaimed "Good Heaven here are the names of that angel Miss Caroline and Lady Stuart andand" had Olivia permitted her to stay another moment in the alcove she would have discovered the rest but that amiable girl believing  she could not get her away too soon hurried out protesting "They should not have time to settle their business and be back by dinner"She took however the first opportunity when they had got into a path which did not admit their all walking together to assure Henry she was doubly indebted to him for his considerate goodness in preventing her from running on to perhaps fatal discoveries"Generous Henry you feared Jenny who finds alas but too many occasions to speak of Sir Guise would have been led by seeing the names of his fair daughter and deceased wife into a train of thought that it is not for her peace she should indulgeBut I wonder we have never observed these names beforeindeed it has not been the manorhouse summer this yearthe castle has made us truants from this our other home I do not think" continued Olivia availing herself of being behind Henry in this narrow pathway and Jenny's walking before the grass on the opposite side being left for mowing  and almost ready for the scythe"I do not think any of the family has been in that alcove since July was twelvemonth when you remember we all dined and passed the day there I do not remember any penciling then and it is odd enough how the names of the Stuarts should be there as none of them except Charles would be likely even to come upon our grounds since our unfortunate quarrel you know Is it not strange Henry But hush" said she"Do not answer me now dear Jane will think we neglect herstop let me pass you and join herbut do not loiter behind"  Saying this she bounded beside him at a place where the grass happened to be scanty and like Camilla seemed scarcely to bend the bladeThus did Henry escape a discovery of an imprudence which the excess of disappointed love alone could excuse for had Olivia put her first design into execution or Jane continued to go on the following verses would have been found pencilled  in a smaller character immediately under the names of Caroline Lady Stuart Sir Guise and Henry  O potent Love that thy true sighs  Could reconcile antipathies  Ah then thy rosy bands should join  Henry and faithful Caroline  Then too their long contending sires  Warm'd by thy soulcementing fires  To thy pure shrine should incense bear  And parents aid their children's prayer  Ah try then Love thy potent sighs  To reconcile antipathies  This effusion escaped Henry in one of his tender migrationsfor there was scarce a spot on any one of the estates which had not received some memorial of his disappointed passionand in not a few places his Muse had been called upon to celebrate the fair object of his afflicted heartexcept in those exigencies when he was really too much distracted by his passion for Caroline to indulge his passion for poetry or even to know that the fictions of poetry had a place  in his heartso entirely was it at those times rapt by the realities of love Happening to be one day sitting in the alcove which we have just left when he was far from happy yet as far from being hopelessthe precise state of mind perhaps which admits a poetic description of real feelings his thoughts took that turn in prose which he afterwards versified in the manner we have seen The warmbreathed prayer for the moment soothed the woe but how he suffered such a telltale evidence in which "his hand appeared against his heart" to remain we know notcertain however it is that a future hazard from the same cause was put at defiance for the verses were rubbed out so effectually the same evening that not a trace was left for the searching eye either of curiosity or jealousy  CHAPTER XI  AS Henry and his fair companions were ascending the flight of steps which led to the front of the manorhouse Olivia  observed "That two persons on horseback were near the paddock" which was at the distance only of a few paces from the back of the mansionOlivia with Jenny ran to the edge of the steps to see and Henry followed as the persons on horseback were passing the great gatethe ironwork adjoining to which ran the full length of the house and courtyardJenny cried out "Oh heaven there is my guardian angel herselfthere is Miss StuartI should know her from a thousandthat is she madamthe beautiful lady on horseback and the person with her is good Mr DennisonI must indeed I must go and pay them my humble respects"  She was down the steps and round to the iron railing in a moment exclaiming at every step "Heaven bless your ladyshipGod preserve you Miss Caroline and you too Mr Dennison"They were returning from their morning ride round the parks by the public road which encircled the three estatesOlivia hearing the name of Caroline impelled by the recollected  fondness of infant days and by veneration to see a lady for whose virtues she bore such respect ran with no less speedand Henry agitated by a thousand emotions rather flew than ran to behold the cause of all his bliss and all his anguish Caroline having stopped her horse on the first hearing of Jenny's ejaculations recognised the person who had uttered them but had scarcely time to exclaim "Whom do I beholdIs it possibleCan it be Jenny Atwood"before the sight of Henry and Olivia put all her ideas to flight "Dear associate of our blooming hours" said Olivia"has chance at last permitted me again to offer personally to your virtues that tribute which Henry Fitzorton has a thousand times heard me pay youand which my secret heart had mingled with my constant prayers for the choicest blessings of heaven upon the good"  Caroline was about to reply but was so visibly affected by the emotions of admiration and astonishment excited by the unexpected sight of perhaps the three persons upon  earth most calculated to raise those emotionsand possibly by some other not undelightful reflectionsthat she could not utter a word and with great difficulty kept her seat on the horse and when Dennison reminded her "That Sir Guise must be within a very short distance as he heard the gate shut which belonged to the cottage where they had left him conversing with the labourerand as the sudden sight of Jane might occasion some disturbance" the good old man recommended a separation of the parties for the present"Gracious heaven" exclaimed both the ladies as if inspired by the same wish and vexed at the same disappointment"How cruel""I have ten thousand things to say" cried Caroline"And I a million" observed Olivia  "Sir Guise Stuart coming did you say" questioned the trembling Jane Atwood  "O how long my heart has ached for this meeting But you shall hear all from our dear Henry" said Olivia to Caroline"And I hope some favourable moment  will arrive whenbut at present this deserving object of your attention might make it perhaps"  "I hear the sound of the horses' feet" cried Caroline"Barbarous fortune""Ride on for goodness' sake miss" exclaimed the alternately flushed and pallid Dennison guiding her horse from the railing again into the road"Jenny Atwood get out of sight I charge youmy master is just behind" Then beckoning Henry towards him the old man whispered"Joyful news dear young squire joyful news you'll hear it soonbut master must not see Jennywe shall be in a peck of trouble again if he doesjoyful news joyful news"  The rapidity with which all the parties conversed and separated and the characteristic actions and looks of each person were such as to exceed our powers of description Dennison and Caroline were soon out of sight for when they had past the iron rails the interposing trees and thickening hedgerows shut them from the view  Henry and Olivia though scarcely able to support their own emotions were engaged in carrying rather than leading poor Jane Atwood into the housewhere they were no sooner arrived than the hapless victim of love and conscience almost fell on her knees burning at the same instant with her blushes as she implored permission to be taken where she might just have a glance one glance at Sir Guise without being herself seenpromising that it should be the last request she would ever dare to make concerning him"and oh pray pray consider whatever be his faults he is the father of" Then seeing Olivia give a half assenting half denying look betwixt compassion and reluctance as she raised her upthe hapless girl followed to a chamber in the second story without seeming to want any of the strength or life which had before left herand running to the window that looked into the road she clasped her hands together crying "Theretherethere isthere isthe father alas of my poorpoordishonoured" and  without finishing the sentence fell senseless upon the floor lost to the view of what she had so earnestly supplicated  It was not easy to recover her for when she had any return of life and reason her quick sensibility of shame for the confusion she had caused and the weakness she had betrayed produced such terrifying relapses that had not True George been dispatched to the manorhouse to say dinner waited and gone back with his usual speed seeing the posture of affairs and asking no questions but taking it for granted the coach with which he soon returned would be necessaryit is not probable they would have regained the castle that day  When Olivia and Henry had leisure to separate the reflections which the foregoing scenes had crowded upon them a new light was thrown over many old subjectsFirst it appeared very clear to them both as it afterwards did to the whole family that such was the dominion Sir Guise Stuart had still over the affections of Jane Atwood it would be highly improper and indeed impossible  to place her at the manorhouse or any where else in the neighbourhood of the abbey Secondly Olivia was struck with the increased personal beauty and graceful manners of Caroline set off as they were by an ineffable kind of smile which seemed to open upon the person addressed the warmest and most brilliant rays of her heart and understandingindeed she saw Caroline also under the influence of unusually happy feelings proceeding from the joyful news that Dennison hinted at she therefore gently reproached Henry for not having done her justiceshe doubted whether even his candid mind had not suffered the insults received from the father in some small degree to create a prejudice against the daughterbut this idea was done away on her reconsidering the matter "for" said she with the most unsuspicious simplicity "if this were the case it would have operated equally and perhaps more so to the disadvantage of the son"She then tried to account for the matter in many other ways and it ended in her reasoning as  usual to her Henry's credit she told her own heartand the intelligence communicated to her cheeks a suffusion of that beautiful bloom which is produced by conscious pleasureshe told her own heart that the tender partiality which Henry entertained for herself made him blind to much greater perfections in every other womanThis settled the point to that heart's content and he was again honourably acquitted as to prejudice but found guilty sweetly guilty of injusticeyet love pardoned him even that offence "For in truth" said she "injustice to Caroline is love to Olivia"It is at any rate very certain that amongst all her ways of investigating this want of rhapsody in Henry on a subject whereon she thought its whole scope would have been warrantedshe never once hit upon the only cause to which it might have been attributed and to which a thousand other young ladies would most likely have assigned itReader whatever be thy sex in the degree that thou art armed with knowledge of the worldor art arrayed only in  that natural innocence which has no suspicions or concealments and which may long be the amiable victim of its credulity without at all supposing it is sothou wilt pronounce upon this part of Olivia's conduct and character If thou hast the world's wisdom about thee thou wilt condemn her as a silly girl wanting penetration where the most stupid are said to be sharp sightedbut if thou art endowed with that unsuspecting quality we have mentioned proceeding from unpractised innocence thou wilt love her for possessing that which wert thou united to congenial virtue would make thy home a paradise and thy partner such as the old poet has described where he observes thou mightest  Lay thy sleeping life within her arms  But whether thou believest such excellence for natural or not we can only reassure thee such was the excellence of Olivia Clareand if thou art a man the worst we wish thee is that thou mayest be convinced  of its possibility by marking such another woman for thine own  CHAPTER XII  IN the progress of the evening after these occurrences Jenny by the tender assiduities of Olivia became much more composed though at the first sight of her own little one she burst into a flood of tears amidst which she told the infant she had encountered her namesake she tried to impart to it a share of her own emotionsand concluded by asking the poor babeas if it were of an age to feel and reason on its misfortune "Whether it would be possible for Sir Guise to look upon that innocent face without kissing loving and affording it some protection"  But the greatest difficulty for the historian of these pages is to enter into or explain the result of Henry's sentiments and feelings on the various incidents of this eventful day every hour of which as indeed of several preceding ones had gradually wrought  him to a tension of thought and sensation almost too oppressive and tumultuous for his reason to sustainEvery time he beheld Olivia he witnessed not only her particular attachment to himself but the general excellence of her characterHe saw all that is most graceful and most worthy uniting in her dispositionhe perceived that she was so guarded by the ingenuousness of her own heartit would have required none of the refined arts of a hypocrite to deceive her in whatever most concerned her peace even for her whole life togetherhe observed that her faith was so entire in him that as he never did and indeed never had opportunity to intimate her affection was not returnedit is doubtful whether any thing but the strongest confirmation of positive proofs could have persuaded her to believe it For his deepest mysteries she had an explanation supplied by her love and satisfactory to her reasonand for his very languorswe will not use so chilling a word as coldnessit was perhaps not possible to his naturefor his languors her  own delicacy suggested an apology or rather a vindication Her warm encomiums on his Caroline evinced the superiority of her soul to that petty jealousy which too often takes alarm at the charms of another womanand her behaviour to the poor Atwoods more especially to the dishonoured Jane notwithstanding her trespass in a point which few females can pardon in each other under any circumstances no not even where their conscience tells them for the most  selfish  reasons they ought to have a degree of fellow feelingwas a fresh instance amongst innumerable others of her liberal and forgiving spiritplacing her conspicuously on the list of the truly good though not on the catalogue of those whom Mr Addison has emphatically called the "outrageously virtuous"  These considerations reinforced by those which as auxiliaries he placed before his eyesthe family arguments in her favour such as a similarity of religionthe ardent hopes of both their parentsthe reward which so much constancy such unwearied  tenderness and goodness claimed from himwith the sad reverse in case of his remaining insensible or undecidedsuch as a religious dispute the most of all human contentions to be dreaded whether in families or in statesthe misery perhaps the death of Olivia's father and of his own parentsthe despair perhaps the distraction of Olivia herself should she discover not only that she had not been the object beloved but that he had all along loved anotherthese reflections we say with the impressions left on his mind by the keen observations and cautionary hints of his brother John had at intervals since he returned from the funeral of Lady Stuart almost reconciled him to the idea of surrendering up his love as a sacrifice to his friendship gratitude and filial dutyand how powerfully these three advocates can plead their cause in a heart like that of Henry Fitzorton those who are acquainted with their eloquence alone can tell  At times he even pleased himself with the proud triumph he supposed he should  feel on such a sacrifice and thought for a moment the felicity of many ought to outweigh in a generous mind all considerations for the happiness of oneTo encourage him in these sentiments he now paid more than his wonted attention to the words and actions of Oliviaexpatiated on her various attractions personal and mentaltalked to others and to himself about her and absolutely set himself seriously down to the task of trying to ripen his affectionate friendship for her into loveat least such a degree of it as would guard her from his own wandering feelings should they join their handsthe natural effect of all which was that although he did not make Olivia more in love with him because that was impossible he riveted the affection she sincerely felt for him in a manner that death alone and that her  own  death could break the chain for she had been heard to declare and truth guarded while it graced her lips that Henry's descending first to the grave could not impair her attachment "since I am convinced" said she weeping at there  being a human possibility that he might die first"the memory of him would be infinitely more dear to me than the life of any other man be his professions or pretensions what they might" But alas the very attentions which we have observed Henry had imposed himself were imposed as a  task  andlike other forced formalities and coercive lessons which  must be learned  turned the whole into a reluctant but necessary toil  Hic labor hoc opus est  was its motto which in the end made him recede from the point he thereby proposed to gain in the very proportion that Olivia whose tenderness was prepared to receive every the least impression and expression of hisand whose own tenderness was her heart's spontaneous joyadvanced towards it  And indeed those efforts in favour of Olivia were always made by Henry after several days' absence from Caroline but the bare mention of the name of the latter the sight of her miniature which the reader certainly  recollects he was in possession of and to which "though it be not here written down" we trust the said reader has represented the too faithful lover as frequently paying his secret devotionor even the most trivial circumstance that had allusion to Caroline would in a single moment level with the dust the laboured fortification he had built in his fancy for the reception and defence of OliviaAnd when he supposed his partiality to that lastmentioned amiable girl was greater than it used to be after he had heard her launch forth into eulogies on the person manners voice or recorded deeds of Caroline it was then most demonstrable that his esteem was the greater for the one because she had then done most justice to the otherin fact because Olivia his  friend  had offered homage to Caroline his  love  and thus did the former become the victim of her own unsuspicious generosity  CHAPTER XIII  AFTER this explanation it will not be matter of surprise to the reader that though Henry neither spoke nor was spoken to in the momentary interview he had with Caroline at the manorhousethe sight of her and perhaps another look of which  he  only knew the sense and sentimentfor lovers alone can translate with accuracy the silent language of lovethe most recent cordial poured into his heart by honest Dennison in those brief but potent sounds of "Joyful news at home young squire"these were more than enough to make him forget the little he had learnt from contemplating the virtues of his fair inmateand convinced him that his heart was neither a convert to Olivia nor an apostate to Caroline  While yet in this disposition the hour appointed for his interview with his father approached  and he determined it should also be the hour of his long smothered confidencebut what was his surprise what his disappointment when betwixt the time of True George's coming into his apartment to announce his father's being prepared to receive him in his chamber and his ascending the stairs to obey that summons his mother hastened in much disorder to say the interview must be postponed as a sudden return of his poor father's complaint made it impossible to speak on any subject in which his feelings were interested but that if he found himself not sufficiently recovered in a day or two he would depute  her  to communicate his sentiments "which I am sorry to say my dear Henry" added she "are of a nature not to brook delayand I am not without my fears that something he has just heard respecting you Henry has been the chief means of bringing on a fit of the illness to which you know he is unfortunately subject"  The trembling Henry after expressing the most sincere sorrow for his father's sudden  attack earnestly entreated to know how he had been the unhappy cause  "I have received your father's strong injunctions" replied Lady Fitzorton "not to breathe the subject either to you or to any of the family till farther notice and must now return to his chamber for alas Sir Armine is all this time in extreme pain" Turning round however as she was going out at the door and looking steadfastly"Henry" said she "if the intelligence which has reached us be true your own conscience will point it out and if happily it be false the same bosom instructor will acquit you and leave on your mind no other regret than that your father  must  suffer from the misconception till it can be done awayIn either case" added his mother "the report we trust in God has reached only to your father and myselfheaven forbid that it should have extended farther"  Henry's bosom instructor told all and more than all perhaps of the tale to which his mother alludedit did not hesitate a moment to suggest to him that the fatal  secret of his heart was beginning to circulate He still suspected it had come to the ears of John and he did not at all doubt but it was now rapidly making its progress through the castleThe first wish of his soul we have seen was that this  might  be the case but all the feelings of gratitude of delicacy of duty and as it will speedily appear of interestmade him desire the discovery should be attended by those  preparatory explanations  which if they could not exculpate might qualify his conduct  Indeed he began now to suspect that the secret was already more spread than he had before supposed though it was plain from Olivia's whole demeanour that it had not yet been communicated to her  And this reader seems to be the place at which we must speak to thee again though not perhaps for the last time in the character of recorder of these annalsWe are not to learn that a printed book is a very perilous and in some sort an assuming undertaking and that the wit and wisdom of a reader are upon guard and in arms like  jealous centinels to espy the weakness vanity negligence and ignorance of the man who comes forward as an entertainer or instructor of the public  Some of these errors are of course obvious and it is extremely probable that thy acumen has enabled thee to detect many many more not generally apparent and in good time thy faultfinding powers may assist thee in discovering others but as we would not perversely maliciously or wittingly leave any of the stumbling blocks in thy way we will at all times do our best to remove them as well for thy ease as our own for it is as sorry a thing in books as in lifeand we hold it alike villanousto put people whether writing or talking to them out of temper when it is in any possible way to be prevented  Now it may happen that before thou hast gained this stage of our history we have put thee a little out of humour by a seeming violation of probability it may have offended thy critical talents that we should have as it may seem to thee maliciously  contrived to lock  this  Family Secret in our Henry's breast although such a number of keys not only in his own house but in the neighbourhood were ready to open it Perhaps thou hast long since exclaimed "Go toCan it be supposed an impetuous youth should pay his court to a lady in the neighbourhood to the daughter of his father's bitterest enemy for so long a period undiscovered that many of the servants of her family and of his that a brother of each house and now perhaps of both notwithstanding all the private and public tumultscan it be supposed that this matter should be any secret to half the surrounding parishes and was there not to be found one officious enemy or "goodnatured friend" or idle gossip who on the swift wing of folly or curiosity or the yet more rapid one of malice would have even panted to carry the tidings to the only two persons most interested in its truth or falsehood namely Olivia and her father or was the neighbourhood of Fitzortoncastle the only spot in the whole world where  no such friend enemy or gossip in petticoats or in breeches resided"  In reply to such interrogations it behoved us to search somewhat deeply not only into Henry's secret but into the secrets of human nature and having so done we firmly believe that our knowledge in these hidden mysteriesreverentially and not vauntingly be it spokenwill clear up to our reader's entire satisfaction whatever talents he may have for discontent all that remains to be discovered on this at present questionable subjectand that in a way that may justify us in keeping Olivia and her father out of Henry Fitzorton's secret should it be necessary a great while longer  At present it may be sufficient to remind the reader that if he looks into the history of life he will find that the persons most interested in any family secret are generally the last of that family to whom it is imparted  CHAPTER XIV  No wonder therefore that Olivia and her father were in the castle the last and the only persons who heard the secret that so nearly related to themselvesfor although lovetales being amongst the most light are the most easy of carriageyet it may very possibly happen that even the strong temptation which naturally arises out of a strict inhibition to do the very thing forbidden may in some minds be contrasted by a yet stronger desire to resistAnd this was the exact case at presentthat stronger desire was the sincere love which was entertained for Olivia by every part of the family even the gossiping part of it in the servants' hall would sacrifice the delight of doing what was commanded not to be done to the superior pleasure of saying and doing every thing that could keep  her  from the knowledge of whatever might give her pain And as to Sir Armine and his lady there  were other obvious reasons why the intelligence that might reach them would be withheld from Mr Clare and his daughter  Now in regard to Caroline Stuart though the same motives would operate the same way towards concealing from her the secret of Olivia and Henryfor Olivia could not be more the object of domestic good will amongst the servantsit was in her case less necessary to act upon those motives for Sir Guise scarcely ever had a guest at home since his disgrace but Henry and father Arthur and there was not the smallest intercourse between the kitchens of the two houses from whence most of the materials for secret history are collectedand she really had no opportunity of knowing nor did she hear any thing that related to the Fitzortons since the separating quarrel save what Henry and her brother Charles chose to communicateand whether those unhappy friends were likely to tell Caroline as matters now stood the reader may by this time well judge  Henry Fitzorton's illfated passion therefore  yet remained to be told to those at the castle who were the most deeply interested in its effectsYet in the proportion that he imagined it known to others he panted for its being communicated even where he most trembled to confide it and in the perplexity which his long suppression produced he began to wish that it were unravelled by any means rather than it should not be unravelledand the more especially since the mystery of his love was not the only one that oppressed his heartSometimes he determined to write sometimes to speak the whole story to Olivia and throw himself on her generosity Sometimes he had thoughts of making her father first acquainted with the history "whereof by parcels he has  somewhat  heard perhaps" says he "but nought distinctly"This was however rejected and all his hopes were again anchored on Olivia whom he fully resolved to inform of every thingand that the very first opportunity  On the heel of this determination Olivia herself who had been giving her assistance  to Henry's mother to mitigate the sharp agonies which his father had been enduring came running into the room and presented a letter to Henrysaying as she delivered it"I hope it will prove a cordial to your spirts which I know your father's sickness must depressit comes from the abbeyand who knows but our good stars may be working together so far for our good that Sir Guise may permit his angel of a daughter to be upon the same terms at the castle as are enjoyed by his son CharlesFor know my Henry I am a great dreamer and I have had a sort of vision about thisI see 'tis a lady's handI would lay any thing we shall find that our Caroline is the writerbut even if it should be so and my dream  should  come true we must keep it to ourselves and not say a word of it to any of the familybecause it will be so delightsul so have the secret between us and divulge it just at the time we have brought about a reconciliationAh Henry if you and I should after all be the means of such a happiness how comfortable  will it be to all partiesfor it is such a shocking thing for neighbours to bear malice for so long a timeand though perhaps we can do little good with Sir Guise we might put up with a great deal from him to be in friendship with Miss StuartDo then read the letter and tell me what it saysthat is if it goes at all to my last night's dream"  Henry who know at the first glance that the letter was directed at least by Caroline had been trying by every means in his power to conceal his agitationwhen a servant came to desire Olivia's immediate attendance upon Lady Fitzorton She had scarcely left the room when the trembling and impatient Henry opened the billet which contained these words "Scarcely can I hold my pensuch is the satisfaction of my heart to inform you I write by the command of my father to invite you to the abbey where we may enter into the particulars of the extraordinary but endearing and renovating encounter of yesterday morningan encounter which  presented to my view three persons I had long most anxiously desired again to beholdJane Atwood my lovely playmate Olivia and Henry FitzortonDo not write any thing in reply to this hasty billet part of which is confidentialbut  come yourself  tomorrow noon the time appointed by my father to receive you You will imagine how I rejoice in a reconciliation betwixt my father and my brother's dearest friendAh Henry guess the emotions of Caroline Stuart"  He had just finished the perusal when True George came hastily into the apartment presenting another letter"Just brought by the post your honour and I came with it as quick as I could because I believe 'tis from 'Squire Stuart the lieutenant and I thought it might bring your honour good news"  Honest George was partly right in his conjectureit brought tidings at once of the most pleasing and painful natureCharles acquainted his friend"that he would listen to no terms of accommodation with his father unless the restoration of  Henry at the abbey was made the preliminary condition of the treaty" observing to his father that"he had plainly discovered the strange conduct of Caroline had originated in her father's cruel commands"Then followed these expressions"If you ever Sir hope to see the face of the son whose heart you have almost brokenreinvite my injured friend to your house where I have my good colonel's leave to give him the meeting and shall hope to be at the abbey almost as soon as this letter and in a full confidence of your treating my friend as he deservesI am your dutiful Charles Stuart""Go then my dearest Henry hasten to reassume your privileges"so the letter went on"It is but returning to a happiness I owe to you in kindAh I owe to  you  far more than I can ever pay till my sister is your ownbut pardon the vanity of my affection if I consider her hand as a recompence in full even for all your pain for all your goodnesseven for the lastthe  commission  and yet that  disinterested  office is sobut I accept itfrom  you  yes I accept it  with tearsof  joy  your brother John too noble generous manly Johnhow shall I ever settle the account with himYou know not the prosessional service he too has done me my colonel I find and your military brother have been in correspondence for my honourThe former swore and by a hero's oath the god of warit would be sinful to conceal it from me though our glorious John had enjoined it yet as I did not promise 'tis no breach of trust you know and 'tis fit a man should know his real friendI have no second Caroline my Henry to offer Johnindeed I know but one more such woman in the worldOh if Caroline could call  her  sisterbut it is madness to think that way yet such an alliance would bind up all our wounds It can never bethose wounds  must  flow though the lifeblood of Charles mingles in the stream Had the heart of my friend been captive to my Oliviapardon me for the weakness of calling her what she will never beI think my own would have been guarded from captivityor reflections on the prior  claims of my dearest Henry would have made me look upon his  choice  with the eyes I look upon my sister or as you yourself Henry look upon Oliviaor if a tender idea had at any time obtruded I would then have expelled it as a traitor encroaching on the rights of sacred friendship and mutual loveBut as I know your heart is another'sas I know the love is not reciprocal and as I feel she is dearer to me than the breath I now draw in deep and bitter sighsOh how peace would return to us all Henry did Olivia experience that sentiment for me that she cherishes so fondly so fatally for my friend  "But why do I talk of peacealas I have never known what it is since last we partedThe loss of my mother and the little prospect of my ever being happy with the adored Olivia preys upon my health and bears down my spiritsOn these subjects ever dear and ever fatal to my remembrance I dare not dwellbut the only solace in this long absence which I have been capable of receiving has arisen from  proving that my own evil destiny has not rendered my heart callous to the happier fate of my friendHasten then I say to the abbeyenable me my dear friend by your presence to support that of Sir Guise Stuart without forgetting I am his son or too keenly remembering that he is the cause why I shall never more behold the face of my dearest mother Ah how shall I lookin vain for  one  of the smiling welcomes of my return How shall I feel the changeYour society therefore will be even necessary to the dejected spirits of your poor Charles as well as to our beloved Carolinesurely some happy event will yet take place to displace the barriers which appear immoveable I speak only of those which oppose the union of my friend and sisterfor myself alas a barrier stronger even than the errors of  my  father or the just indignation of yours opposes my every hope of happiness with Oliviaeven her own cold indifference to me and her heart's warmest though unrequited attachment to my friend  Accursed fortuneyet by heaven I would rather unite myself to a fiend who loves me than to a seraph who could not give me the heart They talk of a war Henry would it were comeselfish cruel murderous as is the wish to thousands of the human raceI cannot but exclaim would it were comeMy fatal passion seems to gain such strength as to render me weak to every other tieeven to that which holds me to my species It is not without difficulty I conceal my sufferings from the excellent colonel"You droop Stuart" said he to me this morning taking me by the hand but with a smile of encouragement "you droop my ladI am no talker Charles but do you want any thing within my compass I do not desire to clog you with obligation I shall therefore only ask would you borrowI have heard your father is not so liberal as his son is deservingOr is there an enemy here" laying his hand on my heart "got into the breastwork and in possession of this little fortIs there mutiny withinI do not however ask for love  secrets and if I did you perhaps might be disobeying orders even to your colonel Cupid is greater than a generalissimo and takes command of all the armies in the worldfieldmarshal my lad of the universeBut how is this I hear you are going to give me upyour friend Henry Fitzorton I find has procured you an advanceI wish it had not taken you out of this regiment but""I wish so too sir" said I"But"replied the colonel"it takes you to one in which that Henry Fitzorton's brother John is captain and may one day have the commandand so as it moves you only from one friend to another I must learn to be content"The generous man shook me by the hand and walked away I shall bid adieu to him and to many of my valuable brother officers with infinite regretand be assured amongst all my cares I am not insensible that your generous heart assisted I cannot but think by your good father's heart should have fixed me in the regiment of John FitzortonWhy Henry have you interdicted the subject  but alas military and every other ambition but that which cannot be gratified is I fear dying in my bosoman unfortunate passion alone lives thereit will consume me Henry I shall grow insensible to every thing elseno surely the affection I have for my Henry Fitzorton will survive the general wreck and holy friendship be preserved entire amidst the ruins of Charles Stuart"  So various were the emotions which the perusal of Caroline's billet and this letter occasioned that Henry could scarcely read to the end Love friendship pity hope fear admiration joy and sorrow took possession of him by turns and at the conclusion they all seemed to be at war in his bosom His friend Charles his brother his parents Olivia and Caroline tyrannized at onceThe empire was long divided long contended forbut love as is generally the case in such dispositions asserted its dominion looked upon all other passions as usurpers and reassumed its sovereignty on the throne of his affectionsCaroline Stuart  appeared to be fixed there too stedfastly for any usurpation to prevail  CHAPTER XV  IT was in this crisis that Olivia reentered the apartment eager to know the contents of Caroline's billet and to convey to Henry the intelligence of his father's being much bettershe never omitted any communication which she supposed might obviate pain or promote pleasure"Well" said she with vivacity" is my dream outdoes Miss Stuart mention any thing of our yesterday's adventuredoes she honour her playmate with her remembrancedoes she notice Jenny Atwoodand is there any chance provided our little plans succeed with all our fathers of Olivia and Caroline ever becoming friends invested with the privileges of Charles and Henry"  What a cruel string of questionseach kindly conceived and sweetly deliveredHenry was however collected enough to  stisfy her who attributed all the emotions of his ardent love to sentiments of glowing friendshipand she entered into the reconciliation of the families in general and the longdesired intercourse of Caroline and Olivia in particularonly in a less degree and on a much more disinterested principle than himself  "Miss Stuart" said Henry"is so earnest to hear more of Jane and to pour forth the tribute of praise to Olivia that she has even persuaded Sir Guise to give me an invitation to the abbey where I have not been you know since the funeral of lady Stuartand Caroline has written in the most impatient terms to acquaint me with her father's acquiescence"  Here Henry pretended to rummage his pockets for the billet itself and expressed some surprise what could possibly have become of itthough we are afraid there was very little reason for surprisethe said billet being probably not only in his pocket but often in his hand during the affected searchand no doubt he could have produced  it with nearly the same degree of difficulty as the taking the hand which held it out of the aforesaid pocket  But Henry  simulated  you see readerthis letter having again thrown out the explanatory bill he predetermined to withhold the billet and was accordingly inspired with a due degree of wonder what could have become of it  "Never stand looking for the letter" observed Olivia who appeared always fated to help him out of his embarrassments unconscious that she was thereby plunging deeper into her own"never stand looking for the letterFor heaven's sake go to the abbey directlyI have heard you say Sir Guise is a passionate capricious creature and has his starts of rage and reconciliation and who knows how soon he may change his mind againthen we shall all be at a loss for such another opportunityBeside your good father is better and you can go with perfect easeI need only say to him you are taking your beloved wood walkyou can go to the forest you knowand  that you were quite in spirits at the thought of his mending so fastI am sure every word of all this will be true"  Henry now observed "That an epistle was just come also from Charles"and without any of that surprise or difficulty attending the production of Caroline's billet he drew it from his pocket"See" said he"Olivia what a pacquet"  There were one or two passages which he could wish to have read to her as descriptive of his friend's passion for herselfhoping the knowledge of it might lead the way to something favourablefor although his own passion so far as it depended on Caroline was now in a better train than it had been for a considerable timehe felt the situation of his faithful Charles as one of the most oppressive of the many heavy drawbacks upon his newlyrevived hopes  Unfolding therefore the pacquet to see whether it was not possible to bring out something like an explanation of two passions of which Olivia had as yet no suspicion  he was hastily running his eye over the pages in order to separate the communicable sentiments from such as could not safely be read aloudwhen Olivia repeated her wish "That he would repair to the abbey" promising to hear his friend's account when he returnedYou provoking thing you" cried Olivia"I feel that I shall love the sister as well as you do the brotherand here you are so taken up with your friendship for the latter that you are losing the only opportunity which may happen this age of bringing me and the former togetherUpon my life I shall again suspect you have taken some unwarrantable prejudice against that sweet girl and do not love her half so well as you oughtSet off this instant if you would not have me feel confirmed in this hard suspicion"  Olivia drew him betwixt sport and seriousness towards the door where Henry exclaimed"Ah Olivia if you knew the condition of that excellent young man Charles Stuart at this moment your gentle  heart would pity him""His condition" answered Olivia"good heaven has any thing befallen him""He is and long has been suffering all the tortures of an hopeless passion""Then I pity him indeed" said Olivia"for I do really think were such a misfortune to have happened to me it would have broken my heartI know myself Henry so well" added she"it would have killed meand indeed the certainty of that would be my only consolationPoor Charleshe is an amiable creature" "He is one of the noblest young men upon earth" answered Henry"and would make the best woman in it the happiest""What then prevents the lady of his choice from being soCan she be insensible to the affection of such a lover""I do not believe" replied Henry"though it has been of some standing and they have been very often togetherthat she yet so much as suspects his passion""That's very strange" said Olivia"you ought to do all you can to assist him my dear HenryI am sure the kind youth would do the like  good office by younay he has spoke to me of you an hundred times not in so animated a manner indeed as you deserve but very very warmlyhe perceived your virtues wanted no advocateI protest if I knew the lady I would try all the force of my little eloquence to win her heart for himWhy does not his divine sister exert her powersCan any one resist herMethinks we should all confederate combat and conquer in his causeare you not of this opinion"  Here was another home question asked in the utmost simplicity of Olivia's heart which sincerely ached for CharlesHenry turned round and walked away to the window "I do not wonder that you are uneasy" continued Olivia"but what can be the reason of the lady's IndifferenceIs she already engaged"  "Fatally so I fear" replied Henry"That's terrible" answered Olivia  "And to a man who is himself betrothed in the most solemn manner to another" cried Henry  "Worse and worse" rejoined Olivia"and does that other lady return her lover's passion"  "Entirely"  "And I suppose the gentleman's affection is as great"  "It is alas it is"  "I know not then what can be done for your poor friend for the case seems to have shut out all service all good officesI do not see a single opening to promote his suitfor who you know would attempt to divide two hearts already united to make  any  third happyMake the case our own a moment my dear Henrywe should never bear even the  sight  of the wicked seducer of the affections of Henry and Olivia for instance even though we were both perfectly convinced all his or her arts would be vainI protest my blood runs cold at the very thought of such a monster  "Nevertheless the condition of the unhappy Charles" added Olivia after a recovering pause and finding Henry much disturbed"is dreadful indeedAnd I  am not surprised at the misery I see you are suffering on the occasionI now clearly perceive that your sympathising heart has made this one of the strongest sources of your late alas too frequent melancholyI cannot blame you for it it fills my own breast with grief and I weep that I cannot mitigate it"  Henry was extremely affected more especially as Olivia now applied all that her tenderness could devise to give him comfortand though intended to promote a very different emotion to fill up the measure of his despair on his friend's subject and his own she took his hand and carrying it to her lips where it received a chaste and delicate pressure"How infinitely grateful am I to you my beloved Henry" she exclaimed"and how grateful ought we both to be to heaven for exempting us from those agonising trials which are and must be inseparable from hopeless love Oh that your friend could experience the felicity which is permitted you and me Henry to feel at this moment with the  sanction of both our dear parents upon our headsI cannot feel my blessed state without the tears of joy gushing from the fulness of my happy heartI see you share my sensationslong long may the sacred sympathy continue and may these drops"she wiped away the tears which were running along Henry's pallid cheek"may these drops of overflowing felicity be the only ones Olivia's tenderness or your own shall bring from your eyes"  "In pity cease Olivia" cried Henry"I can bear no more"  "Let us separate a little while" answered Olivia with the most bewitching accents"compose yourself my dearest friend and then pursue your walkthe air will restore you and be sure you try to make Caroline love your Olivia as Charles does Henry when we are all friends"  Olivia now made an effort to rally her spirits that she might recover those of Henry  "When we are all friends and mixed together you I Caroline and Charles  we may beguile the latter of his griefsat least our loving endeavours shall not be wantingI insist therefore upon your setting off and I will give you as you have so great an undertaking in hand leave of absence for the whole afternoon"  Olivia was again leading Henry out when recollecting herself she cried "But stop a moment I have had something of yours in my pocket these two daysyour brother John sent it meand it is very charmingly finished indeed My father saysand so does yoursit is much more like than when you saw it before but for my part I really think it a thousand times too handsome"  Before Olivia had finished her prefacing speech she had taken out of her pocket and unfolded a little parcel which proved to be that miniature of herself which the conflicting John had painted for Henry and which was now regiven by the lovely original with a grace and at a moment which might have ensured its welcome almost from an enemymuch more from the  deeply penetrated though unfortunate Henry  As he received it from Olivia she said "Tell the truth now Henrydoes it not flatter me greatly Yet do not tell me so for I should weep if I were to think your fancy and affection could not draw as partial a likeness as any painter in the worldso take it with you and as I can not with any propriety go with you to the abbey just yet let it be my substituteand be sure you shew it to Miss Stuart and tell her that I send it as my representative and if it could speak it would soon make out my dreamdo not forget this I charge youSo now I will go to poor JaneI declare Henry I can never get from you and must run away at last"  CHAPTER XVI  HENRY had an anxious desire to make his personal enquiries after his father but was really afraid to encounter himUnder the different impressions therefore of that  tender father's displeasureof his brother John's silenceof Olivia's overwhelming goodnessof Charles's generosity and distress of Caroline's summonsand of Sir Guise's mysterious invitationhe once more took the road that led to the abbeyat the sight of which mansion after again reading Caroline's billet as he past along the great avenue his heart began to resume its accustomed emotionsand as he approached within view of that little window already commemorated in this history those emotions increasedand by the time he gained the grand portico late so sternly closed upon him and now to be so wide opened by  authority  they totally absorbed every other consideration  To say the truth Caroline herself had for some time thought it strangeperhaps taken it a little to heartthat Henry had not since the evening of the funeral made an  effort  to visit at the abbeyShe was satisfied of the great propriety of his conduct it was certainly what prudence prescribed and had he attempted to act otherwise it  is probable she would have marked out the very line of behaviour he ought to have pursued and declared herself much dissatisfied had he not obeyedYet Love my good reader isas peradventure thine own heart can attesta very inconsistent deity and can very much approve and disapprove be pleased and angry at the same time and at the same thing Caroline had as lively a remembrance of the parting look she bestowed upon Henry at the abbey gates on the night or rather on the morning after the funeral as if she had seen it on her countenance in a mirrourand she thought it expressed enough of gratitude and affection to hold out a future welcome and almost beckon him towards herThere was no immediate probability indeed of his meeting with any such welcome but on the contrary every likelihood of a repulse from Sir Guise and consequently from herselfand yet perhaps she would have been better satisfied had he hazarded this than as it appeared to her to be so over exact as wholly to estrange himself  If there seems any thing in these observations incongruous to the reader we can safely refer him to our patroness Naturefrom whom every word has been faithfully copied We speak here to readers in general Of lovers we shall only request that they will consult the little historian in their own bosoms  Henry's conduct at the funeral howeverhis defence of Sir Guisehis attention and delicate consideration at the awful ceremony which preceded the affraywrought very powerfully in his favour with Caroline and she was truly desirous of an opportunity to pay him her heart's acknowledgementsindeed such desire began to take possession of her the very hour she bade him or rather looked him an adieu and had continued increasing ever since  Her transport therefore at having the power to receive him now by her father's consent may more readily be imagined than described To imagination then we shall leave itbut notwithstanding Caroline's impatience we are sorry we are unable  to grant them or our reader the pleasing interview till we shall have shewn him the means by which that consent was obtainedfor the pacquet of late ensign now lieutenant Stuart unfolds but a part of these means  CHAPTER XVII  THE reader hath in perfect recollection no doubtbecause it was a very materialpointthe worthy resolution of Sir Guise Stuart to become at least in his external behaviour to his own family and even to the Fitzortons an  altered man  now as this could not be done without a considerable degree of address he resorted to a power whose aid and inspiration he always invoked whenever he had any great undertaking to performand to conceal the bitterest resentment and deadliest hate certainly came under that description This tutelary power was neither any of the demons above nor below but simply and solely that bosom friend which enabled  him to effect his foulest intents more completely than if he had been in league with all the infernal deitiesnamely his own fraudful heartThis indeed was allsufficient as well to suggest evil thoughts as to devise the means of carrying them into executionand in the present case it not only empowered him to conceal the hate and resentment abovementioned but to substitute in their places the fairest appearances of forgiveness and goodwill in short he was a master in that great and useful science to a determined knave so finely described by Shakespeare  He could smile and smile and be a villain  He began to put in practice a system of this kind immediately after the funeralAs he sat at breakfast the succeeding day "Caroline" said he"your brother having thought proper to leave us at such a time to ourselves we must comfort each other as well as we canThis is but a melancholy house at present my dearsuppose we  were to leave it and walk out a little into the airit may be of service to us both"  He took her hand and they walked into the gardenMeeting Dennison upon their return into the house Sir Guise exclaimed "Tell the gardener to be particularly careful of those myrtles in the corner of the hothousethey were the favourites of your poor lady""And one of them I see is drooping" cried Caroline"as if it mourned her loss""Good Dennison let  this  be remembered" continued Sir Guise Having said which he held his handkerchief to his face and shed as many tears as were consistent with his grief Caroline had herself noticed these myrtles as she past the greenhouse and bestowed upon them many of those drops of real sympathy which might give her father the hint to counterfeit thinking that as good as any other piece of hypocrisy to advance his planA more perfect example of genuine and affected sorrow hath rarely been seen than what the father and daughter then exhibited  Dennison like Caroline was touched by the novelty of this conductThey were soon convinced it was not the start of the moment by an increase of good humour the next day and so on in succession as well to the rest of the servants as to Dennisonand at length the whole kitchen pronounced their master to be  bona fide  a new manprior to which Charles had written but not by Caroline's medium such letters of reproach and menace to his father that possibly the fear of that which they threatened being put in execution might have some weight in bringing about this marvellous reformationThe baronet however without communicating the contents of the letters to Caroline answered them in the most unexpected manner to the entire satisfaction of Charles who thereupon wrote the letter to Henry which has been communicated in a former chapter  But this was not allThe conduct of Sir Guise was of the most general kind and extended even to Father Arthur He made  ample confession of the errors of the past promising as large atonement in future  And in regard to Caroline he was every day proposing some little plan of consolationgave her one of his favourite horsesand not only allowed Dennison and another servant to attend her but often accompanied her himself more than once introducing the name of the Fitzortons and particularly Charles's favourite and her own without any other allusion to old grievances than observing that it was a great pity when neighbours could not agreethere were always faults on both sidesfor his part he looked upon implacable hatred as the blackest amongst the crimes inasmuch as it was the farthest removed from the relenting mercy of him who is ready to pardon all our trespasses whenever his forgiveness is piously and unaffectedly sought Holding such sound doctrine as this before Caroline and Dennisonparticularly in the presence of Father Arthurhe by degrees so thoroughly persuaded these and indeed  the whole family that his reformation and repentance were sincere that Stuart Abbey now resounded the praises of the man whose vices all its echoes had before so often repeated  This happy change was attributed by all to the salutary impressions made on the good baronet's conscience when he came to reflect on the fate of his lady In private discourses of this matter among themselves Dennison observed "it was a long lane that had no turning" and that "it was better late than never"recounting at the same time an history which he conceived to be in point "of a poor wretch who had been in a constant habit of all manner of wickedness till he was turned of sixty and then took up all at once because his conscience would not let him sleep anights whereupon he made his peace with God and was so good a Christian before he died that though he was as sinful a creature as Sir Guise before all the parish blessed him and went to his burial"  Father Arthur gave the praise of this conversion  where he thought it dueto the great restorerand took more than his accustomed delight to visit at the abbey For the past week indeed he had been an inmate often wandering in the woods of Stuart so well calculated to inspire and cherish meditation till the hour of repast which he would take with the familyand then devoting an evening hour to private prayer which was his invariable custom he would remain in social endearment yielding to all the felicities of his mind and constitution till bedtime  The happiness of Caroline was indeed extremeher gratitude to her father was in proportionand had she not now and then retired to her chamber to shed a tear of regret to think that her dear mother lived not to witness and to share this blessed alteration her happiness would have been without alloy for besides the above felicity a prospect of reconciliation opened once more on the houses of Fitzorton and Stuart She even had the comfort of hearing and being herself permitted to mention the name of Henry  with due respecther brother was made partaker of her joyand her favourite Father Arthur no longer withheld his visits on the score of shunning the house of strife where he had so often found it impossible to be a peacemaker  And in so fair a train was the general happiness that on the day she encountered the party at the manorhouse gate she would assuredly have forgot she had a little secret quarrel with Henry for not doing that which had he done she would have resented and have told him the delightful tidings which she had in store for him had not the sudden appearance of Jenny Atwood the sight of whom might have thrown a cloud over all these agreeable prospects made it impossible for her to say or do more than has already been shewn to the reader  CHAPTER XVIII  THE abbey door was opened to the summons of Henry Fitzorton by the good and trusty Dennison who gave him a thousand  welcomes as he entered and ensured it to him afterwards in the following words which after the fashion of the speaker were delivered as he led the way to the object of Henry's wishes"Joyful news as I told you dear squirethe old gentleman and God be praised for it has renounced the Devil and all his works He's clean and clever another thingand he makes us all weep for joy more than he used heretofore to make us cry for grief He has made young master happy alsoMiss Caroline is e'en almost aside herselfand my old wits are about to take leave of meand for the matter of that if I thought master would be at his old tricks again in the way of relapses as they call 'em I had rather bid them good bye nowfor if the Devil should come into the old boy any more it would be worse than before your honour knows"  "True very true" answered Henry who shaking Dennison heartily by the hand exclaimed in the words of Othello thinking perhaps rather of his approaching interview  than the old man's description of Sir Guise though it would well apply to both "If I were now to die" my dear Dennison "I were now to be most happy"  "See what it is to be a scholarLearning is better than house or land after all" quoth Dennison"but here" added the old man opening the door of that very apartment from which some weeks before Henry had been expelled"here is that which is better and prettier than house land and learning put 'em all together"  Sir Guise and Caroline were both in the room and both rose to receive Henry "Mr Fitzorton" said the former bowing familiarly "I had promised myself you would have obeyed a lady's summons more willingly in which case I should have had more of your companybut some business calls me outI must therefore leave Caroline in the double charge of doing the honours of my welcome and her own" Sir Guise repeating his bow went forth  We see as palpably dear reader as if we were now looking thee full in the face and  through that could penetrate into the recesses of thy heart that thou art making thyself up in this place to hear some of the many sublime and beautiful sentiments which now fell from the enamoured Henry and enraptured Caroline and therefore though it were extremely easy for usdid we prefer fancies to factsto fill a very honest modern volume with what they might be  supposed  to sayit would be the most difficult matter in the whole art of bookmaking to eke out one sentence with what for the space of several minutes they really did  not  sayand that for nearly as substantial a reason as ever was given viz because neither of them during that period of time spoke a single wordand upon consulting our goddess thou rememberest the deity here spoken of is  Nature  we find it recorded in a minute of her own divine hand writing"These lovers did not for so long a space enter into discourse for two of my most powerful reasonsfirst because they had too many things to discourse upon to know which to begin withand secondly  because their tenderness was  unspeakable"  Their actions however were sufficiently expressive leaving indeed other language unnecessary Henry held Caroline in his arms and Caroline perhaps for the first time since she became sensible to the thrilling power of his magic touch did not shrink from his embrace In this situation they gazed on each other with so perfect a joy that they were deluged in a flood of those tears which at once enrich and give relief to heartfelt felicity but are de  ied to the excesses of woethe transports of the first admitting of those salutary streams which freshen as they fall whilst the paroxysms of the latter are denied this balmy relief Then it is that the current seems suddenly to be frozen upthe blood itself congealedand every drop of comfort dried by Despairwho may truly be said in such cases  To leave no channels for the tide of tears  Having remained as we have said several minutes in this situation of indescribable ecstacy nature permitted Caroline first to speakand with a frankness that demonstrated she was superior to the little pride of giving pain when it was consistent with her sense of right to impart pleasure she assured Henry that as the happiness of now telling him as far as words  could  tell  how unutterably  dear he was to her was derived from her father's goodness she hesitated not to confess it was the only truly consolatory moment she had experienced since her mother's deathand but for that everlamented event would perhaps be the most blissful period of her whole life "Ah your own good and just heart my dearest Henry" said she "will inform you what mine has often told methat then only can it dare to avow its felicity when that felicity issanctioned by those who gave us life" When she had said this her beautiful hand was presented in a way that justified her sentiment and though perhaps the doctrine  wandered a little from his late practice Henry warmly subscribed to the theory with his lipsgiving the aforesaid hand so impassioned a kiss that the place on which he thus signed and sealed the assent sweetly blushed in confirmation  It is probable that Henry would have given in at the same time some other reply suitable to the occasion had he not been prevented by Caroline who anxious to satisfy her heart in the midst of its own happiness about that of others prefaced her enquiries after Olivia and Jenny Atwood by observing "that she never should quite forgive either Henry or her brother Charles for the niggard manner in which they had both described Miss Clare who" said Caroline "is absolutely a Gracea lovea cherubimI have thought of nothing else Henry except yourselfDo you know she has grown out of my recollection Ah in times long past I remember we flew about our forests and her and your father's parks like woodnymphs  but to behold her in a few years shot up into such a noble yet elegant creatureI declare I am suprised that my brother and you have not both lost your hearts"  The telltale in his cheek might literally be said too often to put him out of countenanceand either obstruct or contradict the story of his tongueAnd though there is a blush which denies and a blush which confessesthey are frequently confounded and mistaken even by persons who are thought to be the most skilful interpreters of silent languageThe manner in which Caroline construed the blush before us may be seen in what follows  "Even so as I live and I suppose you are rival friendscome be honest Henry have I not a shrewd guessIndeed I had a suspicion before as to my brother but must confess IIIyet as I said it was inevitable it wasthat ispshaw how ridiculous I am I cannot speak plain to dayBut do tell me Henry which is to be the happy youth The allconquering Henry Fitzorton  doubtlessAlas poor Charles and alas poor Caroline prithee inform me"here on viewing certain changes of colour in Henry's countenance her own underwent more serious alterations "do III  beseech  you instruct me which of you claims mymyfelicitations which my condolenceButnoyou may save yourself the troubleI perceive who I am to congratulate Youyesyesyouare the happy man Mr Fitzorton IIIgive you joy"  A few minutes previously to this conversation Henry had in obedience to Olivia's wish presented with proper comments as he delivered his message that lovely girl's miniaturebut even this as it turned out was an addition to his misfortunesfor as Caroline surveyed the wellimitated countenance her own actual visage coloured to crimsonshe admitted the excessive likeness the extreme beautyshe even pressed it to her lips and declared it represented an angel in beauty as in graces yet her voice  faultered her eye filled with tears her lips quivered and lest it should drop from her trembling hand she laid it downHenry saw with strangely mingled emotions that the sublime Caroline could fear and feel a supposed rival  Henry could not but make the discovery with a proud and heartfelt consciousness that he was most dear to her whom he adored but he still found himself daily more and more entangled in the web of his perplexing destinyeven as if he had been as dark and insidious a doubledealer as Sir Guise Stuart the difference appearing only in the motives of their conductbut this difference indeed forms the distinction betwixt the evils of vice and the trials of virtueWhile a sensation like this was oppressing him he fixed his eyes on those of Caroline and exclaimed"Good Heaven whenwhen shall the unfortunate Henry be understood by any body"  "He  is  understood" answered Caroline taking his hand and raising the back of it  to her lips"and thus I solicit forgiveness for theI hopealmost only unworthy emotions begun in sport and continued to seriousness that ever my bosom harbouredOh may they never more be its guestshow has Caroline dared for a moment to express a doubt of Henry Fitzorton's faith his oaths his honourI see and acknowledge the justice of his reproach the accusing spirit arms his countenanceYes well may that deep indignation which overspreads his face be kindled against Caroline Would she had been as incapable of a base suspicion as he is of the treachery that would warrant itand yet Henry the strongest test of our affection is the weakness of our fears even when we are assured they are without a shadow of foundation But as indifference never felt those fearsnay as indeed nothing but the most unalterable love was ever guilty of this weakness if guilt it can be calledsurely my Henry will forgive itperhaps he will do more than forgive should it add energy to his own affection  if it be not more  unjust  than vain in me to suppose it  capable  of additionhis pardon is perhaps the only thing which can teach me to forgive myselfalas my own anger I have ever foundwhat you have often told me of the selfrebuking of the noble John is the most intolerable to bearbut this is a misery my beloved Henry can never have had cause to inflict upon himself"  Henry caught her passionately in his arms still struggling with his emotions and Caroline feeling that the supposed crime of accusation could not be too effectually done awayentered at once into the plan of happiness which she earnestly hoped would result to both families from her father's present favourable disposition towards them"Surely my dearest Henry this may be improvedour beloved Charles may have his share in the accommodationI have a whisper for you about him and the lovelier original of this lovely similitudeI will tell it you when you have entirely sealed my pardon and reconciled me to myself  Should it be any way in your power I know how readily you will promote the happiness of  your  friend and  my  brother"  These expressions Caroline accompanied by such atoning smiles and by those little endearing attentions which are of such immeasurable magnitude in matters of affectionthat had Henry really been as displeased as he had been delighted and but half as much in love as the reader knows he washe must not only have forgiven but forgotten all her offencesand moreover circumstanced as he was at this oblivious moment he must himself be pardoned for neglecting to avail himself of so fair an opportunity to explain his Family Secret at least to CarolineHer tenderness indeed was as balm and oil poured upon his woundsand he had almost lost the sense of anguish in the solace of her love now as unbounded in expression as in feeling But some farther questions she put him by way of finishing the wholeand finishers in truth they weretore open again all those wounds and made them bleed with renovated fury  "Howah how my Henry" said she"even now  my  father Sir Guise Stuart is not averse to our happinesshow is  yours  how is Sir Armine Fitzorton to be reconciled to accept ofofof"  Caroline held down her head and a very different huethe hue of fearusurped her cheek"Even now that Sir Guise is become fully sensible of his son's exalted meritshow will the venerable father of such a son" said she "be persuaded to give his honouring hand to CarolineI suppose it has been impossible for my Henry even to glance at this circumstance but possiblyfor I know your generous solicitudepossibly you may have employed your brother John who I am sure bears good will to Charles and must adore youor your brother James may have undertaken to sound your father on this subjector the sweet Olivia herself who has a face and figure to convert hate into loveby the bye I cannot think how you came to prefer me to that angel'tis well for  me  that love is blindI say Henry it may be that you have got that charming  creature to speak in favour of Caroline though I think 'tis as strange that she should not love you and that you should not love herheighowell how I run on yet methinks I should like to owe the greatest happiness upon earth to Olivia And poor Jane At woodI blush to think my selfish heart has so long neglected her she is an old acquaintance of minebut it is impossible to express my astonishment when I saw her with you and Miss Clarethough to say the truth we every one of us appeared to be planetstruckDo explain all this"  Caroline had hardly ended her interrogatories before Dennison came to the door rather stealing in than delivering a letter which he said was brought from the castle in great haste by Mr True George and that he believed it required an answerDennison howeverhaving like George an high veneration for the privacy of all true lovers and especially theseno sooner perceived they were in earnest discourse than he immediately withdrew saying he  should answer the bell the moment their honours thought proper to ring  Thou hast heard of  presentiments  reader peradventure thou hast felt them at least they may be in the little superstitions of thy secret heartThe very delivery of this letter and its coming from the castle had an inauspicious air and soundthe superscription too in Sir Armine's hand was yet more ominous and the epistle itself alas confirmed all these mystic tokens  CHAPTER XIX  LET the reader go back to the state of Henry's mind previous to the receipt of this epistleand he will not wonder that the additional anxiety it produced was too vehement to be concealed from Caroline who suspecting some misfortune had happened at the castle earnestly entreated he would break the sealHe obeyed with a trepidation that denoted he knew not in whose presence he was about to commit this rash act and having read it to the end  in the progress of doing which Caroline vigilantly watched the varying emotions and passions that took possession of his countenance he rose traversed the room and stamped with a vehemence which surpassed all former displays of his known enthusiasmIt was a sudden access of insupportable phrenzyhe smote his breast earnestly supplicated pardon of Caroline on his kneesthen flung from her deplored he had ever seen herand execrated his own being"My hour is at last comelong desired long sought and now it is arrivedDeath sudden death would be reliefmercyblessedness"The affrighted Caroline who lost all her usual presence of mind wanted power to console himspeech colour motion and almost lise forsook herthe disordered soul of her lover now having ascended its tremendous climax he caught her hand and again smiting his bosom exclaimed"Oh Caroline ill fated Carolinethe utmost malice of antipathy never equalled this constant this cruel conspiracy of love and affection to which I see it is  the determination of my whole family to sacrifice the lost the agonizing HenryBut you and you only can prevent it Caroline Behold read from my dear inhuman fatherI am boundI am at the stake the fires are kindling around meand my peace my happiness my heart itself will be consumed if  you  do not this instant devise some means to save me from being led to the hated altar"  Caroline took the fatal scroll and read it with such pauses and ejaculations as its contents were well formed to create  HENRY FITZORTON ESQ  Fitzorton Castle  Beloved Son  OLIVIAthe pride of all our hearts the ornament of both our houses and the glory of Henry the sole possessor of her lovehaving informed me you are gone on a visit to the abbey to explain the story of Jane Atwood I take the earliest opportunity of my being able to hold the pen to tell you I rejoice to find by a letter  from our excellent John this instant come to hand that the report is groundless which insinuated the clandestine disposal of your heart where your hand must never be given without forfeiting all claims to the affections of your familywithout indeed a sacrifice of your father's mother's all our lovesthe life too of Olivia and the death the annihilation of all your religious principlesJohn I say consoles us with an assurance that the foul report is the wicked invention of some enemy to our houseThese good tidings have almost recovered me I shall be able to hold you in my aged arms on your returnand though this I trust will be within a very few hoursfor I understand your friend Charles is not come downI thought it a justice I owed my beloved son to remove from his mind the idea of his father's heavy displeasure in which his blessed mother's would of course have been includedBut thank heaven we suffered only from the poisonous insinuations of some dark assassinOlivia's and my dear Clare's peace is not we trust invaded'Believe it not Sir' says John in  his letter 'neither attempt to trace the  infamous falsehood  to its sourcea life most dear to us all might be sacrificed to a worthless slanderer Eject the aspersion even out of your and my mother's bosom forget it ever gained entrance thereblame almost your own credulity as I did mine severely and take Henry to your arms'  Olivia is in my chamber while I write and seeing that some tears had got unawares into the furrows of my cheek she has been kissing them off without enquiring the cause and did she know itor rather did she know what  had  been the cause of those more bitter ones I have shed upon my pillow  unwitnessed  how would her sweet eyes stream in sympathybut I told her and truly that I now wept for  joy  and for love of her dear Henry to whom I was sending agreeable tidings'Are you Sir' said she'Then for heaven's sake make haste that he may get them speedily had I wings which could aid me to fly half as fast as my wishes he should have what you have  already  written and ere he had read those I would come back to carry him  the remainder'Henry I wish not to disparage any amiable woman whether the daughter of friend or enemybut excepting her who gave to me the blessing of  your  life Olivia Clare surpasses all I have yet seen and I can truly say I love her as well as if she were my own bloodI do not think it will be possible to appreciate her more when she is your wifewhich I hope and trust God she will be in a few days You know not how busied Mr Clare the too generous Mr Clare has been to hasten the hour of your felicity but sickness and infirmity you know my dear boy are loitering agents in the affairs of loveOlivia has lost all patience at this length of letter and seems to think I never shall have done'Old men are so tedious'I can see that expression written on her lovely face She has been herself to light the taper has laid some of her own wax and a seal which bears  true  love's motto  'Always the same'  close to me and has many times told me your privy counsellor True George is ready Therefore though I could go garrulously on even  till I had wearied you as I have Olivia I must hasten to bless you and bid you farewel  ARMINE FITZORTON  CHAPTER XX  IT is most likely Henry knew not in his extreme confusion more than half the contents of this epistle so calculated to astonish perplex and terrify even Carolinethe blow precluded all presence of mind and cut down all energy of character While she was reading the fateful letter the disastrous Henry sat rocking himself in a chair with his hands spread over his face  Caroline now perceived that she had before spoken but too propheticallythat she had been long supplanting another womanand that woman an inmate of her lover's familyeach and all of whom with the concurrence of her own father approved of the allianceShe had not for some time the power of utterance or of motionbut vainly trying to fold up and return the pacquet  she let one of the sheets fall to the ground and begging Henry's pardon attempted to pick it upthen tottering towards the nearest chair she sunk into it and remained in tearless consternation something in the way we before described her in the dying moments of her mother and indeed an affection cherished even in the midst of the most trying circumstances for many years even till it had twisted with the fibres of her heartmight now be said to be in its last agoniesand from a wound as sudden as fatalAt length she made an effort to rise with intent to leave the apartmentHenry observing her rose also and throwing himself at her feet "I perceive you look upon me to be far more culpable than I am" said he"and you impute to treachery the effect of dire misfortuneI call therefore as well upon your justice as your humanity to hear me"Without waiting for her permission or reply he recapitulated as clearly as he was able the whole secret history of his situation with Oliviawith the long train of mysteries  perils and penalties that had attended it from the first moment of his discovering the family designs to the very instant of his taking leave of her at the castle He pourtrayed in the most lively colours his esteem gratitude and brotherly affection for that amiable girlbut asseverated with yet greater warmth that she never had possessed or could possess any part of that tenderness which belonged solely and exclusively to CarolineHe then took a retrospective view of the insurmountable difficulties that had hitherto been placed in the way of his explanation of himself either to his own father to Olivia's to his brothers to Olivia herself or to Caroline He enumerated the sundry and manifold attempts he had made towards this to each to alland the ways and means by which all his purposes were defeated  The forcible manner in which he painted these sad truths and the agonies he had endured from this necessary suppressionhis abhorrence of all duplicity notwithstanding the appearance of having acted the  part of a dissemblerthe nights he had past in the forest when the castle was irksome and the abbey shut against himbrought a shower of tears from the lovely eyes of CarolineHe pathetically conjured her now that his cruel condition was at length unfolded not to add to the miseries he had yet to encounter by withholding her tender advice how best to extend the discovery to the other parties concernedHer wisdom goodness and unalterable affection he declared he must now regard as the supporting pillars that were to sustain him against the anger of his parentsthe resentment of Mr Clare and the displeasure of his brothersall of which however he might consider as unfair and unwarranted since they had though with generous intentions ensnared him without his consent or concurrence given or implied in any manner whateverChiefly he relied on his Caroline for counsel how best to break the affair to Olivia for whose peace of mind he swore he would sacrifice every consideration in the world but the honour faith  and eternal happiness of his own"These" said he passionately"depend on Carolineand should  she  persuade me to break thembut it is impossiblethey find a counterpart in her own soul and she will strengthen my resolution to preserve them with the most religious care to my latest hourAnd as to Olivia so well do I know the goodness of her heart" continued he"so many instances have I seen of her noble disposition that I am convincedwere it possible to tell her how much and long I have suffered from these continued misconceptions on what resistless antecedent claims my vows are founded and what would be the consequence of my breaking themshe would not only resign all pretensions but even be an advocate with the three families to bless and sanction the loves of Henry and Caroline"He then observed in conclusion"that her brother Charles  only  shared the sorrows of his heartand he was confident his friend would aid her to remove them"To all this Caroline only said faintly "I am extremely unwell  you must suffer me to departthe terrifying circumstances which you have related and which I have read shall when I am able to think be duly consideredBut oh if you ever wish me to have the power of thinking again do not detain me now"She left her chair with great difficultyin tremulous accents bade Henry adieuand quitted him in a state compared to which probably many of his former situations of mind thought at the time to be intolerable were consoling  He did not however remain long in this conditionfor a gentleman entered the room soon after who came in this crisis as a comforterbeing his second appearance in that characterThis was no other than Sir Guise Stuart who was extremely surprised to find him alone and equally concerned at seeing him so much out of spiritsHenry hereupon notwithstanding his former illluck when he tried to gain the baronet over to his interest was now so thoroughly convinced of the sincerity of that gentleman's reform that he repeated the  heads of what he had said to Carolineacquainting him with the abrupt manner in which she had gone out of the room and conjuring him by all those things which have most weight with good friends and fathers namely honour humanity and the dread of plunging his own child and the man she loved in ruinto use his strongest dearest influence to persuade his daughter to give him such an answer as with his own intercessions and explanations at the abbey might bring about the general satisfaction and their particular happinessAll this Sir Guise very kindly promised to do"And surely" said the amiable baronet"if I am ready to forget my wrongs and acknowledge my share of error in the subjects that divided our familiesCaroline may contribute her part to the good workAs to poor Miss Clare that to be sure" cries Sir Guise"is the worst part of the business and there is no foreseeing how Caroline may take itor if she could be brought to pass it over who knows but the lady's father and yours and all your family  might consider it a stronger objection to an alliance with our house even than our other domestic hostilitieshowever depend on it nothing shall be wanting on my part consistent with my friendship and my own honour"After this Sir Guise stayed consoling Henry for a considerable timeCaroline's waitingwoman coming into the room to enquire whether Mr Fitzorton was gone the considerate baronet said in a whisper to Henry while he beckoned the servant to stop"Had not you better hear her answer now" Henry eagerly assenting the maid was directed to say her lady's company was earnestly entreated for a few minutesand while the girl was going on this message Sir Guise himself departed saying at his exit and with right dramatic effect "It will be best to leave you togetherI may be some check upon herand it is necessary you know to have her own undisguised sentimentsafter which in the degree that they oppose our own we may take our measures""You are too good Sir Guise" said Henry cordially  taking his hand and drawing it towards his bosomAs Sir Guise went out he cried still dramatic and at the edge of the scene"I must awayshe will surprise usI will take a turn in the gardenthere is yet half an hour's light and as you certainly will not think of leaving us till after supper an opportunity may occur for your telling me what she sayshushI hear her coming down stairsthis door however will conduct me into the garden by another wayBe sure you tell me all that passes"  Whether it was necessary for this injunction to have been repeated or whether indeed any mention of it in the first instance was not superfluous will be shewn hereafter At present our entire attention is called to Caroline Stuart who reentered the room almost in the same moment her father had left itShe had been in tearsHer visage was pale and her limbs yet trembledWith less interruption however than she had herself apprehended she at length addressed Henry"Though I expected  from my maid's report to find my father with you I rejoicealas why do I talk of rejoicingIt isit is best you are aloneI know not whether what I feel at this moment Henry deserves so harsh a name as woman's weaknessbut I am ready to confess that the tenderness which is the cause of it is almost too much for me to bearAlas the preparation of a whole life for a history like that you have toldand for supporting the event which III foresee willmustresult from it"  "What event" cried Henry catching her hand and looking as if he anticipated the most dreadful of all the evils which can happen to man"Do not interrupt me" resumed Caroline answering his look of impetuosity and terror by one of energy that commanded his patient attention"You will not take an undue advantage Henry of the tenderness I have even at a crisis like this avowed for youAh what an hour have I past since I left youAlas this apartment seems to be marked out by our ill fortune as the spot where I am to  meet varieties of wretchednessHere was my poor mother struck with that which proved her dying disorderHere was asseverated a father's curseHere O why have I forced upon me the remembrance of these successive calamitiesthey unfit me to endure the presentalas it is so sudden so unexpectedit has fallen upon me in so cruel a momentPardon meI feel altogether unequal to the conversation I would wish to hold or the conduct I ought to pursuethis last dire blow has left me nothing but powerless tears" Such tears indeed fell from her eyes in overwhelming torrentsand Henry instead of drying them up could only augment the torrentRelieved however at length Caroline observed "that the impression left on her mind by the past intelligence would be eternalthat amidst all her selfish regrets and the agonising ideas that gave them birth she had sense and honour enough to be convinced Henry Fitzorton and Caroline Stuart were now placed beyondso far beyond the possible reach of each other  that even if her father were to lay his sacred commands upon her to marry she should in this second instance of her life think herself justified in disobeying him"  CHAPTER XXI  CAROLINE paused and weptShe then recapitulated his situationplaced before him all the strong parts of his duty and her ownshewed in new points of view the irresistible claims that Olivia her father and both the families had upon himshe observed that though strange impediments had combined to prevent him from an earlier explication those very impediments had given force to the pretensions of Olivia who never suspecting any impediments had existence had been cherishing a pure affection all the whileShe gently upbraided Henry for supposing that she herself would deign to become his wife under the corroding consciousness of having made  any  other woman who had so many superior  claims unhappybut more especially Olivia Clare the friend of her earliest youth"With respect to myself"cries Caroline"being in the constant habit of meeting ill fortune I better know how to struggle with it in the severest shapes it can present itselfand alas the power that punishes me knows it is now about to take a form the most dreadfulperhapsthe most insupportable"  Caroline's fortitude again forsook her and Henry in the struggle betwixt the contrary emotions of hope and fear drew his chair so as to be within reach of her trembling hand which he pressed in his ownbut could not speak  "Yes misfortune my dear unhappy Henry" continued the firm but faultering caroline "has I hope inured my heart to bear what would probably break that of Miss Clare who has been bred up by every smiling power in the lap of indulgencethe pride and joy of two respectable familiesand has perhaps never known any disappointment but what I have already occasioned  Ah Henry how would she hate your Carolinealas yours did I sayhow would she contemn the cause of all the delays and mysteries which have involved her in one eternal maze did she know that Caroline Stuart had like her evil genius so often robbed her of Henry's dear societyYet alas this transient pleasure should not be envied mefor oh what vengeance follows it Indeed Henry I can scarcely bear the thoughtbutbutit must be borne and whatever happens to me I will endure that or any other misfortune it may be the will of Providence to inflict rather than the consciousness of carrying grief distress hatred and perhaps death into the houses into the hearts of so many personsSuch an abhorred union indeed would now force even upon you Henry a just opinion of my unworthinessAnd ought I not to be displeased that you should believe I would take refuge in Olivia's  mercy  to me when I had not shewn any to heror that Caroline bowed as she is by many griefs could be content to owe the possession of Henry's  hand to that bounty which would consign herself her aged father and Henry's parents to wretchedness and despairWhy Henry should you suppose even Olivia could surpass your Caroline in doing what is right"added she giving dignity to her before humbling distress"when Caroline has the advantage of the point of rectitude being first shewn herand had you Henry carried on the concealment longer and availing yourself of my unhappy partiality made me under these circumstances your wife"something associated with the word  wife  fainted on her lips as she pronounced it and many moments past ere she could conclude the sentence"and had I afterwards been proved the dire though innocent scourge of your family how wretched should we both have beenMy disgustperhaps my hatred even of Henry Fitzortonmight have been the consequence"  "And will it not" said Henry starting up with violence"will it not be far worse to give my loathing hand to Oliviaand the afterproof come out that she has  been the cause of all my misery and yoursand though she never can have my hate she never had my love and would  then  be the bane of Henry's of Caroline's and or her own happiness"  "No such proof" cries Caroline more assuredly"need ever happenYou are too good and generous to treat any woman who sincerely loves you unkindlyand kindness from Henry Fitzorton will be in the place of a warmer sentimentnay it is in him a sentiment more tender than the love of an ordinary mindAt all events it is in your power to make Olivia Clare the happiest of women But Caroline Stuart whom you have now acquainted with your situation you could render even more wretchedThere remains nothing for her but accommodation to those severe trials in which alas her whole life has been past Oh I blush not though I weep to say I would not yield up the prospect which delusive hope recently spread before me on weak surmisesor let any visionary clouds that might gather to darken it prevail  NoI would embrace whatever might dispel the surrounding darknessBut cast your eyes on every side and you will see the fatal necessity of taking our resolution"  "Hold" exclaimed Henry"I see the point you aim atyour resolution would not affect the general peace to which you would thus sacrifice your own happiness and mineI warn you that it would subvert itThere is a cause still behind"  "Alas alas there can be none" interrupted Caroline still bathed in tears"there can be no cause why I should not here solemnly bind myself by the most irrevocable vow never more to see Henry Fitzortonthe pride pleafure and passion of my soultilltill he is the husbandofof"  The word  husband  had even a more powerful effect upon the whole frame of Caroline than that of wife for the expression sunk her to the earth  "The husbandof whom" exclaimed Henry"of Olivia Clare Oh monstrous  monstrousOh God"exclaimed Henry raising the convulsing form of Caroline into his arms"yes this barbarous effect even of the very  thought  is a fresh proof dearest life that were Henry Fitzorton the husband of Olivia Clare he would be the most perjured traitor to love and friendshiphe would be the most perfidious viper to sting and wound every breast most dearand Caroline Stuart would become accessary to all his fraud to all his treacheryAlas my love" continued he still holding and still caressing the unresisting the almost lifeless Caroline"there is yet another fatal mystery to be explained""Reserve it" said Caroline faintly"I can hearI can bear no more""Remember" said Henry"remember that I bid you beware as you would avoid the despair the destruction of all that is precious to your bloodbeware of coming to any resolution which shall preclude you from acting as your future duty may prescribe Your brother can disclose the rest"  Caroline had been several times waving  her hand as a sign for Henry's leaving her assuring him by such broken sentences as she could utter that he might depend on her doing what she thought was rightbut that she could not answer to what a degree her illness might augment if he persisted in the conversation any longer till she was more recovered Henry therefore went mournfully but hastily out of the room and by the greatest good luck or something that answered his purpose just as well met Sir Guise gliding from an adjoining apartment He appeared however somewhat confused and agitatedperhaps at seeing Henry uneasy Few words therefore passed between them and those purported on the part of Henry a request to defer the particulars of his discourse with Caroline on account of her sudden indisposition till the next day alleging that as his father was confined to his chamber it would be expected he should sup at the castle  With this requisition the worthy baronet readily compliedexpressing less curiosity than might have been expected He therefore  civilly demanded of Henry whether he chose any of the servants to attend him and on his courtesy being as handsomely declined they parted  CHAPTER XXII  BUT our sympathy of virtuous and superior woe demands that we should leave Henry on the road to the castle and return to Caroline at the abbey This truly amiable and as truly unhappy girl remained without words and almost without sense long after her lover's reluctant obedience to her repeated requisition The first thing which struck her when she felt herself somewhat collected was Olivia's miniature which Henry had left on the table in his general agitation Her examination of this led her to account for several of the mysterious expressions which fell from Henry towards the close of his conversation for on his way to the abbey Henry had penciled on the paper that had been the envelope of the picture  and which remained also on the table "This shall be a transfer to dear Charles" Thus not only the words of her brother which were once overheard and asserted to her by Dennison but those which Charles himself dropt the same morning previous to his setting out to join his regiment were brought forcibly to her mind  It was hence apparent that her brother loved Olivia and not less evident that Olivia had fixed her entire affection upon Henry and finally that both Henry and Charles were nevertheless in the strictest friendship But although this discovery developed the maze one way it involved in it another beyond all her power to unravel yet one inflexible truth pressed on her in a more unrelenting shape even than it had beforethat whether Henry and Olivia were or were not to be united Henry and Caroline could never join since to suppose that Olivia Clare would ever dispose of her hand to Charles and that Henry would thereby be at liberty to offer himself to Caroline Stuart were points equally preposterous  In this state of perplexity her father entered the room and although he was in some perturbation from a cause yet untold he saw his daughter's dejected countenance with parental regret and observed on it that as the occasion had in some measure been related by Mr Fitzorton he would not give her the pain of again telling the story but do every thing in his power to make her happy saying at the same time she must be sensible as well as Henry how ready he had been to sacrifice himself to their felicity though he could not take upon him to answer for events and that he relied upon both her and Henry doing him every justice with his son Charles  The deeplyafflicted Caroline acknowledged that his goodness was written in the tablets of her heart and that she was sure Mr Fitzorton and her brother would ever retain a due sense of it then entreated her father's indulgence to retire for the night  Sir Guise granted this petition also as willingly as he had done the other and after saying he hoped a good night's rest would  set all right again desired her to hope the best called her his dear Caroline and bade her adieu  Since the burial of Lady Stuart Caroline had succeeded to the chamber in which that amiable woman died and this succession proceeded from the very opposite sensation to that which had there not been any separation of sleepingrooms between Sir Guise and his wife would have induced the good baronet to change it for another Indeed he had moved to one at the other end of the abbey but as this motive might have been suggested by the love which could not endure the sight of the desolated spot which brings to memory the object of affection no less than by the hate which survives the grave or by the fear which always attends upon guilt but more particularly when we view the place where our selfcondemned crimes were committed and of course where the consequences of those crimes might be faid to stare us in the face inasmuch as they seem to the "mind's eye" the ghosts of our past foul deedsit is but fair that we leave  the choice of these several motives to the reader's own selection  Certain it is that the night after the funeralon the same night the reader remembers one or other of the abovestated sentiments kept him out of  any  bedchamberhe did remove far from his from his deceased wife's apartment and whatever were his motives those of his daughter in giving that very chamber the preference to every other in the house proceeded from the sincere affection which attaches itself to whatever brings to mind the venerated though departed object Nevertheless we are ready to admit the same measure of affection that filled the bosom and memory of Caroline might be possessed by many other daughters who might yet find themselves unable to support the sight of any thing their deceased parents had worn touched or been accustomed to beholdand indeed we have known some of the most amiable persons fly from their houses their estates and their coutry on this principle and forbid it nature that we should be supposed to ridicule  any  of the  pious terrors or even the superstitions of filial lovewe only feel it necessary to sayas has indeed more than once been proved to the readerthat the mind of Caroline Stuart though melting as love itself had none of these apprehensions Yet the resignation of her late apartment which was also precious to her remembrance was connected with some other circumstances that ought not as they are in keeping with her character to be passed over  We can sometimes better endure the sight of that room where we have seen a dear parent expiring than of that where we suppose ourselves to have taken an eternal leave of a living lover When Caroline at her father's command had bade as she thought it to be an everlasting adieu to Henry she gave vent to all the tender effusions which are set down for thy sympathy reader in a former part of this work but this little spot late so dear to her soon became an object of escape because she found it more difficult for her to perform the severe task of obliterating Henry from her mind while from the  window of that apartment she looked upon many things that brought his image back too keenly upon her sense and although in her mother's room when she was devoid of all the powers of recollection Henry had supported her in his arms her reflections thereupon were more divided than from the view of that windowHas the reader forgotten that it had in full prospect the grand avenue of tender memory the spot where the loves of Henry and Caroline were  first declared  to each other and alas  discovered  to Sir Guise And to close the whole artillery which it levelled against her lacerated heart has it escaped his memory that it carried the eye to the most appreciated part of Fitzortoncastle even to the chamber of Henry himself  Resolved therefore to avoid as much as in her lay the objects which fed her despair she tore herself from these temptations and took refuge in a place where perhaps her grief from one cause was mitigated by the claims from another for it is certain that two sorrows equally great provided they are  of distinct kinds demand that division of our thoughts and afford that sad relief which in any single calamity often overwhelms the sufferer  Her mother's vacated room then she for some time occupied but since her father's turn of behaviour she considered the prospect from her old apartment as both literally and figuratively clearing up and had therefore moved into it again But now that it was overcast by another cloud more dark and menacing than any of the former she settled the plan of a third alteration even as she was ascending the stairssent her woman for her nightdressand directed her steps once more to the room of Lady Stuart  All that was heroic about Caroline was subdued She had not only exerted but exhausted whatever the natural strength or acquired energy of her mind could supply to support her in the last discourse she had held with Henry and from the weariness of a soul more harassed than the frame that enclosed it she had scarcely gained her  mother's room ere an extreme faintness overtook her and she fell down in a swoon in which without any violenceindeed scarcely without any sound or motionshe remained till the maid whom she had sent into the other chamber came to restore heror more properly speaking till persecuted nature by a temporary suspension of life restored herself  But with the powers of her life the sense of that happiness which would have made life desirable was not alas renewed On the contrary she revived to the most agonizing reflections Her present appeared less to be endured than her former fate To that if she had not been reconciled she had in some measure been resigned She had imposed on herself the severe but necessary task of calling to her assistance whatever would be most likely to keep her heart under some discipline though she found it impossible to vanquish the host of tender but powerful enemies that had there gained residence these however reason duty and time three of the most able and experienced  generals and on whom she wholly relied for success might at length have routed But when the enslavers were almost worstedwhen Love himself after many desperate skirmishes and some pitched battles with the forementioned chiefs was made a captive and led out of his citadel in Caroline's breast in chains  then  to have reason and duty not only demand a truce but throwing down their arms and as of old in the story of the Horatii run into the embraces of the opposite party declaring that the war was unnaturalafter such a treaty approved of by duty and indeed signed and sealed by that aweful powernay after both the armies formed by these potentates were disbanded a chosen few only keeping garrison at the abbey to prevent surprise from the castle where it was imagined some malcontents not yet brought over were posted  then  we say to have the amicable convention broken by an enemy from the most unexpected quartereven in the gentle Olivia Clarewho without herself being as yet conscious of it involved the  houses of Fitzorton and Stuart in deadlier hate than that which the daughter of king Priam occasionedthisthis was indeed too much  Such however was the caseHostilities recommencedevery passion and every principle mustered their forcessounded to armsand duty compassion reason and  rival  love were all at once warring in Caroline's bosom  CHAPTER XXIII  WHEN this amiable but unfortunate girl was left at her strong desire alone she cast a mournful look over the apartment and derived some little comfort from reflecting that her dear mother who breathed her last in it was now in her peaceful tomb"That is some comfort yet" said she"it is the cordial drop thrown into the bitter cup of my despair"  Taking from her pocket that handkerchief of which her eyes but too much stood in needshe felt the little pacquet that  Henry left with her whether discreetly or not we cannot now stop to consider for her brotherHer confusion at the time it was first shewn her did not allow her to observe it accuratelyscarce indeed to take it from the paper in which it was wrapt or to do more than lay it again on the tableindeed she did not as yet know whether it was intended for her inspectionfor she seemed now to have no memory of any thing but her own weighty sorrowsOn taking it up again however it slipt from the silken envelope which Olivia had folded round itShe once more examined the resemblance of the innocent girl who had already been the cause of so much anguish to the families which she so anxiously desired to see happy  It is not an easy matter to describe the mixed sensations that took possession of Caroline as she attentively looked on this picturehow distinct from those she felt on receiving that of Lady Stuart and the two others from the hands of her dying motherAt Olivia's she looked and to  Olivia she spake as if it were the original"Beautiful author of the misery which awaits us all" said she"dear playmate when life was youngwherefore are we rivalsYet how was it to be avoidedhow could it be possible for thee to live in the presence of my Henryof  thy  Henry and his thousand virtues and not give him all thy heart even alas as I gave him mineAnd what but that pride which must now be severely humiliated could so long blind me to the certainty of thisBut how is it that his own has escaped the magic of thy merit and thy charmshow has it been possible for him not to return thy passionYet love is capricious else had thy empire been unquestionedAh hadst thou honoured my dear unhappy brother with thy affection for now I see into the source of his long concealed distressYet thou art not my rival but my associate in griefEven the irreparable loss which Caroline must sustain will be no gain to thee OliviaWe must both be wretchedwretched in the extreme"  The breath of her sighs had dimmed the crystal of the miniature but her tears falling fast upon it at the same time"Heaven knows" continued she"I would not willingly obscure thy sight or happiness nor wouldst thou mineAh that we could relieve the misfortunes which I foresee are in store for us bothfor indeed Olivia to thy painted image I may without fear of wounding thee confess Henry Fitzorton cannot be more dear to thee than he wasthan he isand I fear ever ever must be to"  She pressed the miniature to her bosom without finishing the sentence"Yet" resumed she"in this confession I do not wrong theeI do not wrong thee Oliviafor I have lost him for everHe is gone from me never never to returnAnd were he thine this moment or divided from thee even as he is from Carolinesuch is the severe destiny in which we are both entangled we must be both miserable"  In the struggle of these emotions she had turned the miniature on the other side  which presented several little devices done with Olivia's hair such as Cupid and Hymen binding Venus with her own cestusand underneath a motto in pearls suitable to the designon seeing which she uttered many more sentiments expressive of her feelings in the course of which she adverted for the first time since the death of her mother to the circumstance of her own and brother's miniatures which she knew had been in Lady Stuart's possession and not spoken of at the time when she received the other on the very bed which was now spread before herThinking however they were deposited in some of her mother's drawers into which she had not yet examined all thoughts respecting them soon subsidedThat of her mother however she drew from her bosom which had been its "most delicate lodging" ever since and kissed it ferventlythen returning it to its tender but now trembling throne she resumed her attentions to Henry and Olivia who appeared by turns to occupy her entire  soulIt is beyond question that her affection for the one notwithstanding all increase of misery and impediment was now at its heightand her pity for the other derived perhaps partly from fellowfeeling was no less extreme  The sense of her father's unwonted kindness the sincerity of which was not for one moment doubted relieved her muchshe thought it far better that her sorrows should flow from any but the  domestic  fountain whose waters of strife indeed are the most bitter we can possibly taste"Blessed be God it is not my father's fault now" cried she "that I am relapsed into my former wretchedness with every aggravation that could be heaped upon it He alaswhich is indeed one of those aggravationspartakes my grief after he had generously sacrificed to me his strongest resentments and taken my dearest Henry to his arms"  She then adverted to her brotherand again taking up Olivia's picture she exclaimed  in a softly rebuking tone"And thou also art the unhappy cause of my dear Charles's afflictiona youth scarce less deserving thy adoration than Henry himselfBut for his love of thee O insensible he at least might have been happy and in this dread hour of my own woe I might have looked up to him for comfort courage and pity He will now alas be absorbed by his own griefs"  She had no sooner uttered these reproaches against Olivia than she turned several of a more bitter kind and with as little reason against herself whom she accused of cruelty folly falsehood and madness recapitulating the several causes of impediment why neither Charles and Olivia nor Henry and Caroline could ever hope even had their own hearts so arranged matters to be united by holy vowsShe next pressed the miniature to her lips and bestowed on it a kiss in token of her reconciliation and repentanceIn short she proved in every reflection she was in love and in despairshe proved indeed at once  she was tortured by all the feelings of her heart in which jealousy was not the least tyrannic  CHAPTER XXIV  WHILE the picture was yet at her lips the door was opened by her woman who seeing her mistress not yet in bed first announced and then ushered in Charles Stuart"Dearest sister forgive my impatienceI am this instant dismounted from my horsebut your father telling me you had retired to your chamber at this early hour I was alarmed especially as he said our beloved Henry had passed the afternoon here and had but just left youI should have thought such a teteatetefor my father intimated he had left you togetherunder such smiling prospects too would have kept sleep from your eyes for this week to come""My dear dear Charles" cried she tenderly embracing her brother"sleep was never farther from them than at this momentor had they been closed  surely nothing but the sleep of death could have rendered me insensible to the arrival of my ever good and affectionate brother""Sleep" answered Charles surveying her countenance"nothose eyes I perceive have been but too much awakeFor heaven's sake what is the matter""Is not joy as well as grief" returned Caroline"the cause of tears""Ah my sister" cries Charles"but that pallid countenance that desolate air and the galled borders of those weeping lids demonstrate a far different cause than that of joyI thought to have found you and my friend as happy as mutual love and a father's authority could make youand I came with all the speed of friendship for him and affection for you to devise some means that might incline those towards your happiness who might be averse to itAnd that miniature in your handHas our beloved Henry at last given it to youI chid him once that he had not done it beforeand called him a loitering lover"  "No truly" said Caroline sobbing with stifled emotions"It is not his"  "Not his" returned Charles"surely nothing can have happened between you to make him return your own"  "My own" exclaimed Caroline"Yes Caroline" said Charles"I found yours with mine on that very bed soon after our everlamented mother had expired and gave him both with the benediction of her dying breath still warm upon themHe was entitled to the gifts for now that saint is in heaven who upon earth can love Caroline and Charles like Henry FitzortonI will not think any thing could induce him to give it backlet me seeperhaps he has presented you with minebut could that make you weep"  "It  is  yours Charles" said Caroline"and left with me in trust to present to you the moment I should see you"  Caroline gave the miniature to her brother who on the first view exclaimed"Gracious heaven what do I see my  dear OliviaTell me sister I conjure youtell me have our happy destinies been so run together that whileheaven knows how disinterestedlyI have been labouring for the felicity of Henry and Carolinethey by some yet unknown good fortune have been promoting the happiness of Charles and OliviaOh if I could flatter my heart that this dear dear resemblance of all which is most precious was given by the loved original to be presented by Henry to Caroline and by her to Charlesbut that is impossibleI ravealas it is no wonder I loveforgive pity me"  Here instead of ending his rhapsody he fell to kiss and caress the miniatureejaculating as he gazed "Is she not an angel Carolinedid you ever behold such a browsuch an eyesuch a lipshe certainly inspired the artist who is heI could worship himwhy do you not speakOh my foreboding heart you are weeping still"  Caroline felt the utmost regret at the sad necessity of dissolving the charm that bound  up her brother's senses or rather at restoring him to sense out of that sweet delirium that carried him beyond the bounds of reason into that delicious phrenzy which to such dispositions in such situations affords bliss superior perhaps to what reason ever gaveFinding however that he was still impatientnay that he stampt and raved for explanationshe at length reluctantly cried"Alas Charles would I could continue the delusion till it could be realizedI grieve to say our disappointments are reciprocal yet your friend Henry desired that picture might be givenbut told me you would explain the impossibility of the original ever becoming  his  wife"  "  His  wife" reiterated Charles"Friendship forbidShould I live to see that day but I conjure you to tell me allif the happinessthe life of your brother be matter of concern conceal not a tittle of what I perceive is now labouring in your bosomThe sudden sight of this miniature has indeed hurried me to a sweet oblivion of all my caresbut I now return to the curse of  my reason and the certainty of my despair OliviaOliviamy delightmy destruction"  He now again renewed his attentions to the pictureswore that with whatever intent it was put into his hands it should never go out of them moreand concluded with asseverating that unless Caroline immediately satisfied his heart in all it panted to know he would quit the abbey that moment and repair to the castle to demand of Henry a full explanation  The wild and extravagant manner in which he spoke terrified Carolinebut looking at him with a softness that might have extracted the sting almost from despair itself"Alas my brother" said she "could my life procure to you and your friend Henry the bliss you have lost it should be laid at your feet"She then explained all that had happened in the conversation betwixt her and Henry and when she had brought down her narrative to the deposit of the miniature she observed that she referred for the particulars respecting Olivia and Charles to Charles himself  "Our dear father however" said Caroline "deserves our warmest acknowledgements on this occasionhe has shewn such indulgence that my grateful soul avows he has made ample reparation for all former mistakesnay I feel assured that as much as in him liesoh that his power were now equal to his generous inclinationshe will promote the loves of Charles and Olivia I am persuaded he willIf for Caroline he could condescend so greatly what exertion will he not make for the felicity of his darling sonBut as yet my brother I am to learn how far you yourself are interested in this matterI long yet dread to hear"  "O Caroline" replied Charles"if I have hitherto concealed from you the secrets and the sorrows of my heart it was from the same generous motives that actuated my beloved friend to keep them from you"He then related at length the story of his unfortunate attachment the friendly behaviour of Henryand the noble conduct of John Fitzorton He enlarged upon the cruel kindness of the whole family to  himconfessed that his visits at the castle like those of Henry at the abbey were the consequence rather of love than of friendshiphe particularly dwelt on the manifest impossibility of his ever becoming in any measure dear to Olivia till the passion of Henry for Caroline was declaredyet acknowledged that he did not see though he had revolved it ten thousand times in his mind how such a declaration was to be madehe averred if so heartrending an event as the union of Henry and Olivia were to take placethough heaven could witness that his friendship for the former could be surpassed only by his love of the latterhe would not dared not think on what might ensue"It would break my heartit would make me mad"cried Charles"Would my friend were here at this momentwhy did you let him departSome way must befound to preserve himOliviayoumyselfand all that belong to usfrom the horrors that are impendingconsider of it Carolineoh consider of itconsult your pillowremember what we  have at stakeit is an awful crisisif there is not any expedient to save us from irremediable despair what must be the resultOh Caroline for the sake of pity friendship love suggest somethingmy brain seems turning as I speak to youMy sister and my friend alone are in the confidence of my afflictionit involves themselvesit will spread to all who belong to usCaroline weigh the matter wellI am distracted"  He broke from her and hurried down stairs leaving his sister more perplexed than ever for she perceived too plainly by her brother's vehemence in the relation that the designs at the castle were almost ripe for that event which would determine the destiny of all whom it concernedthe miniature of Olivia had wrought him to a curiosity whose gratification had proved worse than the mystery of his sister's distressIn short she perceived that Charles had been long as violently in love with Olivia as Henry could possibly be with herselfbut with this strong and unfortunate difference  in the returns of the passionthat Olivia was not sensible to indeed was not conscious of the tenderness of Charleswhereas Caroline felt in the bottom of her tyrannized heart in despite of her disappointment and despairthat it beat only for Henry  It was no less apparent to her that her brother and her Henry had been generously but unavailingly playing into each others hands to prosper their affection by imparting favourable impressions of each other to the beloved objectand that although the interest of Charles was not thereby in any measure advanced Henry had not acted with less zeal consistent with the caution it was thought right to observe than Charles in fine that the friendship of these young men was equally noble generous and indefatigable  CHAPTER XXV  THE vigilant Sir Guise like a kind parent who has reason to fear his children were unhappy was upon the stairs to receive his beloved son when he came from Caroline's apartmentmdashsolemnly protesting the supreme delight of his life would be to see his offspring as happy as their own wishes could make themwhich was an exact compromise betwixt sincerity and deceit for in the case of Charles it was true and in that of Caroline it was falseIn fact he was in some sort alienated from the former by the almost constant upbraidings he received on the double scores of his tyranny and cowardiceCharles however still retained much of his involuntary affectionand if any thing in the world except the miscarriage of certain great designs which had been long rolling in his mind could have broken down the bulwark of that impenetrable  stuff of which his heart was composed it would perhaps have been the total loss of his son's society so often threatened  "It is needless my dear Charles" said this affectionate father"to give you the pain of repeating your discourse with CarolineI have heard too much already for my peace and I see you are much affectedThis letter indeed" added Sir Guise "is of itself a history of the plans carrying on at the castlebut do not read it at present tomorrow morning you will be more able to take measures in behalf of your poor sister and counteract their stratagems"  Charles received the letter and seeing it had been written by Sir Armine indeed it was that brought to the abbey for Henry and left there in his confusion"I must read it Sir" said Charles "though every sentence were a poignard and my lifeblood should flow from the wounds"He perused the fatal epistle which had already been the cause of so much distress and when he came to the passages that mentioned  the state of the preparation for Olivia's marriage he burst forth into the most extravagant gestures and expressions  "Have you come to that part" said Sir Guise "where Fitzorton insolently talks of the disgrace and  infamy  of an alliance with our family"  Charles replied to this question only by a wild insensible kind of stare  "And did you take notice my dear boy of the saucy air which the proudhearted John gives himselfinsinuating than an union with the Stuarts would be pollution"  "O Sir breathe not an accent against John Fitzorton"answered Charles recovering himself"He is the second young man in the world and his brother my friend Henry is the firstmy obligations to both are infinite and I love Henry next tobut perdition if he marries herit must not beI will sooner put an end to both their livesto my own"  Charles crushed the paper between his handsthen opened and read it again  His father began to fear he had carried this exploit too farhe saw with terror these violences increaseand did not know how soon they might be turned upon himself  "What is this I see"questioned Charles taking a light to read the passage more clearly"Who is thisJane Atwood"  "Jane Atwood"reiterated Sir Guise whoin his eagerness to shew his son doubtless for some good reason this letterhad forgot what he would at present have concealedbut after the confusion of a moment he exclaimed with admirable presence of mind"Yes they have I understand hunted up that infamous hussy in order to fortify themselves with fresh malice and do me fresh mischief in the countryThink Charles what I am ready to do for the happiness of you and your sister when I am willing to pass over even this mean insulthis low paltry revengeJenny Atwood you know is the girl who I told you ran away from her parish with child and then put it round the country  forsooth that I was the father of the bratYou remember the impudent story I dare say but heaven knows I forgive them allnay my dear son shall even carry my advances to them for the sake of my children's happinessand indeed for that of my own I will meet my bitterest enemies on the road of reconciliation more than half wayas to Jenny Atwood old Fitzorton and the furious Mr John I willI oughtI am at peace with them all"  Sir Guise now strung together and strewed around his pious harangue many an holy text from sacred and many a moral axiom from profane historyending with this asseveration"Yes Charles I repeat I forgive them all"  Whether his beloved son was sufficiently collected to hear any part of the foregoing speech or was a sceptic as to its sincerity is uncertainhe only replied to the passage that had reference to Jenny Atwoodand to that he said with some difficulty but with a marked though obstructed emphasis"As to the poor girl by  whatever means she found her way to the castle Sir I am sure she will  there  find those who will pity and protect her"  "Then you did not expect this marriage would take place quite so soon"interrupted the Baronet willing to shift the discourse"I should not wonder if they were to hurry Henry into it so soon as tomorrowespecially if they should any how hear what confusion  we  are in about it"  "Tomorrow"raved Charles"What Henry and Oliviamarry tomorrowdoes this accursed this murderous letter say soHave you hearddid Henry dare to intimate'Tis well I am come thus opportunely for the ceremonyI will be thereyes depend upon it I will be there tomorrowdamnation"  Sir Guise felt himself now in a worse scrape than ever and wished he had let the conversation take its course even about Jenny AtwoodCharles tore one of the sheets of the letter with a vehemence bordering on phrenzyput part of the fragments into his mouth and champed them between his teeth  The affrighted Dennison came in saying his poor young lady had in a great fright rung to know what was the matter and whether her presence could be usefulCharles roseshook the old man by the handbegged him to entreat his sister's forgiveness for such unseasonable disturbances and that if she would try herself to get a little rest he would withdraw to his chamber and not utter another complaining syllable though his poor heart should burst in his bosom "Bear this message to her good fellow" said Charles "and tell her you saw me going to perform my promisebut let me be called early" Then taking a candle and bidding Sir Guise respectfully a good night he went into his bedroom without thinking of any refreshments after the fatigues of his journey or the greater weariness of contending passions  Dennison shook his head as he went at full trot upon his commission observing as he ascended the stairsthere must be a place of comfort bye and bye seeing that here upon earth there was nonethat high  and low rich and poor can get no rest in this world for the soles of their feetand seeing besides that if this had been intended as a place of happiness his young master and mistress and squire Henry would be as merry as their days were long  Sir Guise Stuart's morality was all in soliloquy for he immediately went to bed though we have our reasons for thinking not to sleep  Peradventure courteous reader thou art disposed to retire into thy chamber also Torpid indeed must have been thy disposition if it has permitted thee to nod while the foregoing scenes were representing But as a feeling spectator enters into and may be said to partake of the exertions of the actor thy sympathy for the sufferings of some of the principal characters may have no less fatigued thy spirits to read than ours to relate on which presumption we here resign thee to what one of our poets has called  Nature's soft restorer  and while thou art refreshing thyself we will  endeavour to prepare something worthy of thy renovated powers  CHAPTER XXVI  IT has been intimated that the worthy baronet had heard or rather overheard the preceding conversation betwixt his son and daughter In truth it is very certain he knew every syllable of their discourse as well as if he had been present the whole time Indeed those parts of him best adapted to take in the intelligence were in a manner present for though he could not in strictness of speaking be said to be an eye he had been an ear witness and could have sworn to the facts on auricular demonstration in any court of judicature as conscientiously as if he had been a spectator The worthy baronet constantly put himself in the way of enjoying all the benefits of this mode of collecting evidence and as to hearing now and then such a character of  himself as he knew he deservedin drawing which his servants or others would liberally deal forth the words'profligatevillaincoward' c he treated these things as mere matters of course which were no more able to reach his conscience at least to  wound  it than the paper pellet of a popgun from a schoolboy's arm could penetrate the anvil which had stood the heat and hammer of a century in a blacksmith's shop  By these laudable means he knew every body's FAMILY SECRETS without any hazard of divulging his ownwhich is frequently an unwelcome interruption to the business in hand perplexing it with adventitious matter Sometimes it must be owned the listener who is justly said seldom to hear much good of himself is a little put to it to maintain his post which the baronet like the poetleaving out only the expletive word "honour"found was "a private station"  CHAPTER XXVII  THE meditations of Henry Fitzorton on his second expulsion from the abbey and partly by that very clearing up of affairs so long dreaded and desired were not more enviable than those of Caroline His night scenes indeed from this place were generally gloomy enough and some evil planet seemed to rule his destiny whenever he passed along the famous grand avenue by which he now again sought the castle  His old habit of holding conversations with himself returned strongly upon him as he reached the pathway at which the first fatal declaration of his love for Caroline took place "Since that moment" cried he "ah what has been my life but a succession of mysteries and misfortunes I am driven from the castle to the abbey and again from the abbey to the castle only to be made more and more the sport of my malicious stars If a gleam of hope breaks  upon me from Caroline it is instantly clouded by Olivia If I labour to teach my heart to sacrifice itself to the latter the former seems to pronounce that my peace and my vows are broken for ever Here the misery of my bosom friend and there the desolation of my own family Even the approbation of Sir Guise which I thought a blessing beyond my reach is no sooner obtained than another impediment starts up to render that blessing of no avail I have left those consecrated walls again in despair and what awaits me at the place to which I am directing my steps If I unravel the like mysterious causes there the like effects must ensuethe tears of Olivia and the wrath of my deardearfather If I remain silent which I have already done but too long that silence will be again adduced in proof of my consent to their disposal of my revolting heart"  All this time True George was within a few paces of Henry but said not a word whenever his master turned or made any transverse motions the faithful servant who had  the legs of a hare though he had not the wings of a bird was on the opposite side in a moment his custom when there happened as in the present instance to be any trees or hedges was to keep as near to them as possible and in case of necessity he was in over or under them in the twinkling of an eye  In truth this honest fellow independent on the veneration he bare to Henry for his booklearning and especially for his quotations from the poets had long suspected and for some time past looked upon him to be absolutely mad and from the various soliloquies he had overheard in which the name of Caroline was so often mentioned he had set it down that this injury on his poor master's brain had been occasioned by his being crossed in love But his sense of honour was naturally too great to breathe the discovery which he thought he had made to any second person upon earth and his fear of offending and indeed of making his master worse had in like manner restrained him from speaking of it to Henry himself In  the daytime George was pretty easy thinking Henry sufficiently safe in the society of his friends or relations but from the very instant that the evening drew in he was as assiduously upon guard as if it was his turn to hold watch on the toll of the curfew and he attended his master's motions from nightfall even until bedtime making it a constant rule not to leave him till he was ordered to take away his light  This general assiduity had not a little endeared him to Henry whose gratitude for every degree of kindness shewn to him whatever was the rank or station of the obliging person was lively and sincere Hitherto however George's nocturnal attendance had escaped the discovery of his master  The dexterity and management with which the poor fellow kept sentry upon Henry is curiousIf any sentence dropt towards evening signifying his master's design to take his moonlight stroll or retire to bed earlier than usual on the pretence of sudden indispositionor if he saw Henry  more than usually merry or sadfor so well had he studied him he looked upon both these extremes as symptomatiche was from that instant at workHe had long known that no impediments of weather could prevent his master's going forth when the wandering spirit seized himIf then the night was stormy or likely so to be George would be provided with his comfortables as he called them according to the state of the elementHe would be as restless in the kitchen or servants' hall as his master in the parlour or 'drawingroomGeorge was as great a favourite below stairs as was his master aboveand his fellow servants found it difficult to make him sit down to a dish of tea or if they prevailed and his hour was almost come he would swallow it in hasteThe maids jeered him upon thisone said he was like a troubled spiritanother likened him to a bad conscienceand the butler who was a great scholar to the perpetual motionRachel one of the housemaids  who was suspected to have a kindness for him tossed up her head and said "She supposed the poor devil was in loveand that he had some lady or another who met him every night in a fairy bowerbut for her part she never knew any good come of forward hussies who went skulking after fellows in lanes and alleysif a man follows a woman" said she"let him follow her fair and above boardfor her part she supposed a brat would be laid at the gentleman's door for all his slyness""Lord Mrs Rachel" replies Mrs cook"why for sartain sure you are jealousMr George has only got the fidgets and as for brats" here she winked with one eye at the coachman and looked stedfastly at Mrs Rachel's shape with the other"as for the matter of  brats  my notion of theseum things is that they are to be had  without  going into lanes and alleys or out of the house eitherWhat say you coachee"Here the cook began the laugh the coachee as she called him continued it and the rest joined in chorustill Rachel would sometimes  times bitterly assert that "heaven knows nobody can ever accuse  you  Mrs cook of having bratsyou may thank God for that howeverlook in the glassthat's alllook in the glass"At other times she would content herself with calling every one a pack of slanderous  enviable  personages take herself off into her lady's chamber where she often sat at worksaying as she left the room "It served her right for mixing with a set of vulgar vandalgoth souls who were born to the kitchen  She  was naturally a parlourbred young woman"  None of these gibes or jeers however had the smallest effect upon George who heard them out if he was certain of his masterand if not he would often leave them in the midst of their irony and pursue his designsOnce indeed he was dogged by another of the servants as far as the outer gate that led into the park but luckily Henry was then a good way forward and George turning round told the fellow that "if he followed him an inch  farther or ever served him such a trick again he would pull the skin over his ears and throw it in his face though he were to die a thousand deaths for itI pry into no man's business" said George"and d*mn me if I suffer any man upon earth except my master whose bread I eat to pry into mine"The fellow hereupon stole off while he had the whole of his skin to cover himand as it may be supposed told every servant in the house for none ever after presumed to interrupt Georgethough it was universally believed he was desperately in love with some maid wife or widow in the neighbourhood who dared only have a stolen interview with him in the evenings  George however was so kindhearted a young fellow and so generally beloved that every body forgave him but Mrs Rachel and even the man he so dreadfully menaced exclaimed "Why 'tis after a woman I warrant and there's no harm in thatHe that won't go out at pitch dark after a woman ought to be d****d"But  Mrs Rachel observed "Such goodfornothing forward harlots who draw young men astrayand the fellows too who can like such filthy nasty hussiesought every one of them to be burnt alive"To which the learned clerk of our kitchen the butler before mentioned slyly answered taking her considerately round the waist "God forbid Mrs Rachel they should all take flame unless you are prepared to go off to the other world in a flash of fire like a skyrocket"  In short George made use of as many stratagems and was as much put to his shifts to avoid being seen or suspected by his master as his master put in practice to escape the detection of Olivia whose custom of becoming as heretofore the companion of his wanderings he had for some time as much as possible prevented  George however was himself in no small hazard of being discovered as he was now following his master to the abbeyfor when Henry had got almost to the castlegate after cursing his fortune at every second  step he all at once wheeled round‚ñ™ exclaiming in the language of Romeo whose destiny he considered at the moment in some respects similar to his own  Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out  This he uttered with a rant of natural grief more truly felt but with much also of the wildness and extravagance of the theatre  Henry then asked himself why the Montagues and Capulets should be thus at varianceThen answered his own question "My only love sprung from my only hate" cried he "Down with the Capulets down with the Montagues  Henry traced such resemblance to his fate in this celebrated love storyand rose so high in his heroics as he ran the parallel betwixt himself and Romeo and Caroline and Julietthat he was to the full as much distracted as they could have been  "No" ejaculated he "'tis past Oh never more must I hope  To kiss the wonder of  my  Juliet's hand  Or drink delicious poison from her lips  Then I defy you stars  At the end of this rhapsody he set off at full speed as if carried away by the sentimentand he had indeed so absolutely made the case his ownforcing it to apply where it did not and appearing almost to think he was the identical Romeo where it didthat had not the darkness favouredat the sight of a man running as fast as he could towards the avenue and then hiding behind the trees in the vistaGeorge would have had good reason to say with Mercutio "A plague o' both your houses"  When George thought all safe he ventured from his hiding placebut not daring to risque another scene of the same kind that night suffered his master to go into the house first and then stealing softly round to the back gate of which he had a key he was in time to slip on another frock and  get into his master's chamber soon after Henry had rung his bellThe family and even Olivia had given up all thought of seeing Henry for the night and had gone to restone of the servants having observed while waiting at supper that young squire Stuart was just arrivedGeorge glad that he had escaped so well went to bed but not without strong suspicions that his poor master would not be long out of Bedlam Nay the honest fellow began to debate with himself whether it would not be better at once to tell the melancholy or rather raving state in which he often saw him to his family for fear worse should come of it"Who knows but he may lay violent hands on himself before one is aware" said George"and then what is to become of usHeigho" sighed George"Love's a sad thingI suppose Jenny Atwood is abed and asleep nowWell God bless herand God bless us allHeighoI'll go to bed tooI hope I never shall be so much in loveHeighoYes I dare say Jenny Atwood is asleepHeigho"  George repaired to his truckle bed which was in a closet adjoining his master's where he had begged long before he might sleepto be within callin case any thing should happen in the night  The good fellow quietly undressed himself but the affair of Romeo and Juliet the Montagues and Capulets had quite settled with him his master's madness which he now considered as incurable and his last words that night were "Ah poor dear gentleman it's all over with him now sure enoughWhat a terrible thing love is when it comes to thisHeighoThe Lord deliver usI wonder how Jenny is to nightI hope I never shall love at this rate"  CHAPTER XXVIII  WHATEVER roses hope might strew on the pillow of Olivia that of Henry was on this night lined with thornsWhen for an instant he dropt into a transitory slumber all the images of a disturbed imagination and tortured mind rose to his viewAt one moment his fancy represented him tossing in the ocean at another labouring in mudsometimes his ears were assailed by the shrieks of both Caroline and Olivia falling in the general ruinand sometimes he beheld his friend Charles pointing a dagger at his bosom  In his waking hours he often resolved on a stratagem to escape the union of Olivia by an elopement with Carolineand projected this so as to form a double plot including the flight of Olivia with CharlesThe violent emotions accompanying this idea extravagant as it was operated with such force on his burning fancy that he suddenly  started upright in his bed and exclaimed "Would it were morningI will be at the abbey by daybreakSurely Charles is by this time arrivedIf not I will go post to meet himWere he at the end of the earth I would travel towards him"Then pressing his repeater which hung at the bed'  head he found to his infinite mortification that it was only two o'clock  The sound of his exclamations had pierced the ear of the trusty George who had himself been kept awake by his own reflections partly about his master and partly about himselffor the havoc he had witnessed in a human breast by disappointment in love made a very strong impression and convinced him more fully of a truth he had before begun to suspect in regard to his own heart  George was certainly much alarmed at the state of his master yet no less struck at the prodigious effects of the passion itselfand as well from the dread of his being one day reduced to the same condition as from the hope that he should noteach lover  commonly making himself the  happy  exception to a general rulehe was effectually kept from closing his eyes  The moment therefore he heard Henry's concluding asseveration that were Charles at the end of the earth he would travel towards himhe leaped out of his own bed and was at the side of his master's just as the watch had repeated the inauspicious hour  "For goodness' sake what is the matter with your honourCan I do any thing for your honour myselfShall I go for the doctorShall I call up the rest of the servantsor the familyI fear your honour is very badHow is your honour's headHotvery hotall of a coalyour honour is in a high feverlet me strike a light"  "No" answered Henry "not so honest fellowI know you love me George"  "Love you your honour Yes" though  my  distracted senses too should forsake me"I'd find as the play says and as I have  heard your honour sayI'd find some interval when"  "Go then to bed" said Henry "rise at the first peep of dawnrun to the abbeyask if Lieutenant Stuart is arrived and bring me word unknown to any body"  "He  is  arrived your honour our coachman told me he saw him ride by the park pales about ten o'clock last night which must be soon after wewethat is after your honour left the abbey"  "Arrived" answered Henry "Then let my own horse and your's be saddled and in the stable ready to mount by four o'clock Leave me now and be sure you are not after the time my good George"  "I'll make very sure of that your honour by not going to bed any moreTry to get a bit of rest yourself dear good sir and I will call you to the click of the quarters so that you shall be on horseback as the clock is striking"  Georgeknowing this to be the best mode of arranging the business both for  his master's ease and his owndid not wait for any objections theretobut commending Henry's lost wits to God shut the door of the chamber and returned to his own  At the time appointed with an accuracy that marked the exactness of his character he had not only done his work in the stable but in the house also for he had made a fire boiled the kettle had a dish of coffee and all his  comfortables  smiling upon a table in what was called the hunting parlour to greet his master on coming down stairsand by calling Henry a few minutes earlier than the specified hour had allowed time for taking the refreshment  What was the nature of his master's business George never enquired This young man had first been in the service of John Fitzorton as the reader remembers while yet a boy and since a private in John's regiment and had so well profited by his military education that he practised ever after towards his commanding officerand such  he now looked upon Henry to bethe law of nonresistance and passive obedienceIndeed a slight nod often testified his assent to what was required of him but most commonly the last word of any message sent him off without any sign or token at all  Henry however having had leisure to reflect on the inconsistency ingratitude and even impossibility of carrying his wild scheme into executiontold George that he had altered his mind as to setting out so early but should perhaps ride or walk to see his friend Mr Stuart in the course of the day and would try to sleep an hour or two now that he might be ready to attend his own family at breakfastand cordially advised George to do the same  The joy of our worthy domestic on seeing his master unexpectedly composed was so great that he sunk involuntarily upon his knees exclaiming with much fervency "The Lord be praised"then drawing the curtains and closing part of the shutter next to the bed that the light might not prove unfavourable to his master's slumbers  he went on tiptoe out of the apartment reiterating in whispers"the Lord be praised the Lord of his infinite mercy be praisedHe may do yet"  Henry's fixed resolution however waslet the consequence be what it might or whatever involvements it might bring upon the abbey or the castle or bothto make a full and free confession of the past and present and longestablished state of his affections in the course of that very dayand indeed at all hazards to prevent his union with Olivia Clare even if the loss of Caroline Stuart and his own ruin should be the issue of the explanation  CHAPTER XXIX  AFTER turning this at length irrevocable determination as he called it into various shapeshow best to proceed in it  whether to begin by discourse with Olivia with James or with his mother whose heart he knew was his ownor whether to make his confessions and his "round unvarnished tale deliver" in presence of the  whole  familyhe lay for some time in a state betwixt sleeping and wakinga state produced by a violent tension of the thoughts to one of those objects which hurries the animal spirits till the mind having fatigued itself and the body is compelled from very heaviness of the flesh and spirit to grant the relief of a pauseduring which we cannot strictly be said either to sleep or wakethe word which for lack of a better we have for it is  dozing  a kind of intermediate state betwixt a vehement emotion and no emotion at allthe mind still carrying on though feebly her former designs till the body relaxed and languid is unable to keep pace with herand a person may lie in this state several hours and find himself in the end without any material refreshment  Out of this dozing then Henry was aroused by a scratching at the door as from the foot of a dogthis was presently followed by another and that again by a whine which spoke as plainly as any language that whoever might be the petitioner he earnestly desired to be admitted As Henry was going to the door he was saluted by the barking of the said petitioner accompanied by a smart pat against the pannel of the door indicating that having done with supplication the said pat might be considered as a sort of threat to effect a forcible entry in case of longer resistanceOn opening the door who should make his appearance but little Fitzso was he calledthe favourite and almost constant companion of Caroline StuartIt had been Henry's gift to that young lady who was grown so fond of it partly for its own sake and partly for the donor's that she never suffered it out of her sight without feeling uneasyIt had been present of course at all the scenes of joy and sorrow which had passed between the lovers and therefore  was much in the good graces of both  But how to account for this unexpected visit Henry could no way conjectureHowever little Fitz came at the right moment to receive a hearty welcomefor Henry no sooner beheld his visitor than he hugged kissed and called him as many endearing epithets as if it had been Caroline herselfThe fancy of Henry always ready to encourage the illusions of his heart soon gave to this delightful "airy nothing" more than "a local habitation" He called the dog dear little namesakeindeed it was at his own desire Fitz had been so honoured"For" said Henry "it will make Caroline then think of the donor"He assured little Fitz that he was more grateful for his attention now than at any former period of their friendship for each other as he was convinced he came on purpose to comfort him in the hour of his despair"But how did you find your way to my chamberand how long hast thou been sitting at my door poor fellowAnd  why didst thou not address thyself to me beforeSo thrive my soul as I would share with thee my bed and board sooner than with the finest object amidst the works of creation thy mistress alone exceptedBut what will she say to thy playing truantdoes she know of thy comingor did Caroline send thee in charity to Henry"  He continued this rhapsody much farther and kindled in his course till it is to be doubted whether he did not really expect regular replies to those interrogatoriesBe that as it may we never understood that the dog gave any answer whateversave that he had now changed the whine of complaint to the exulting note of joyfor it admits not of a doubt that the little animal was extremely glad to see Henry who had frequently taken him into the fields and forests and treated him with the sight of a hare or partridgefor which as well as other tokens of goodwill little Fitz who was extremely well born and well educated toobeing of the spaniel kind and of a choice breedwas entirely grateful so  that in fact there was no love lost betwixt him and Henry  But whatever impression this enthusiastic address to little Fitz might make upon  him  it sunk peculiarly deep into the mind of True George The door being open when the dog entered he heard quite sufficient to convince him that the few hopes he had before entertained of his master's wits being restored were now over and that the unhappy gentleman was ten times more distracted than ever  The various questions he heard put to the dog gave George the strongest apprehensions even of raving madness but when Henry with the utmost extravagance of voice talked about sharing bed and board with the dog and giving him the preference to all the objects of created nature except Carolinethe poor fellow could hardly contain his sorrowful emotions which in despite of himself forced their way between his teeth as he muttered "Alas quite gonemad as a March hareLord have mercy upon usIf I thought the case would ever  be mine I'd hang myself at once out of the way Oh JennyJennyAll this for a dumb beastvery well in his place I would not hurt a wormbut a worm is a wormand a dog is a dogand a dog is a beast of the fieldand what is a beast to do in a man's bed except a Christian gives him a pat and away or so to get him downas much as to say 'If you please sir off my bed and make room for your betters' and to be sure Christians are better than dumb beasts at any time and if they a'n't more shame for 'emPoor soulquite lost indeed gone for everO merciful father for pity how mad he is"  Most of this speech was delivered as George walked to and fro in the long gallery which extending the whole length of the bedchambers Henry heard only the words which began and ended itviz "quite lostmad as a March haregone for ever" c To which he replied "What's that you saywho's thereGeorge"  "Yes your honour" replied George  giving the matter a turn for fear of making his master worseever an uppermost idea "'tis only me sir""Gone for everand mad as a March harewhat are you talking about" said Henry"Little Fitz please your honourI found after wethat is your honourgot home he had followed usfollowed you that isfrom the abbey so I let him have a night's lodging in my room knowing he was Lady Caroline's dog and made him a snug birth in the corner and when I got up he was off and I was saying to myself says Ihe's gonehe's lostand if he is it will make Lady Caroline as mad as a March hareBut I see your honour has him safe so it's all well But breakfast waits your honour"  "Well then" said Henry "give this dear little fellow something to eat and keep him out of sight till I can walk over with him to the abbey and be sure you let him have what he likes for d**n me if I don't love him almost as well as if"  "He shall be taken good care of your honour depend on it" interposed George  lifting him from the bed and walking off with him under his arm before Henry could finish his asseveration  Henry had always been much attached to and not a little superstitious about the fidelity and genius of dogs and this friendly visit of little Fitz was to his poetic heart a fresh proof that the canine came very near to the human species in those matters barring some very nice and subtle distinctions about which he would sometimes reason with John till that philosophic youth would pronounce him as did True George sometimes to be mad and sometimes only merry  It was in the present case a yet farther confirmation when before Henry had left his chamber little Fitz had given George the slip and again paid his respects to the lover of Caroline And at the time of this his second appearance Henry was offering his devotions to Caroline's miniature This he told Fitz lest he should approach it in an unhallowed mannerthis he told Fitz was the picture of her they both adored  "But you happy creature" added Henry you will be fondled by the original when I perhaps" He then fell to caressing the spaniel and the picture by turns and concluded by exclaiming as he was going out of his room "Dear precious resemblancenever neverwill I part with theenot Death himself shall snatch thee from me"  The chamberdoor was all this time wide open and the above words were heard distinctly and the speaker of them seen by Lady Fitzorton Mr Clare and Oliviathe two latter at that instant coming from Olivia's chamber where the former had as usual given her a gentle summons to see if her daughter as she always called her was ready to go down to breakfast and they met Mr Clare as he was shutting the door of his apartment  The trio were all of one mind as to what they heard and saw Olivia blessed herself and cried"Dear soulhow he honours my poor giftSee madam"turning to Lady Fitzorton"ought I not to be proud""It gives me almost as much joy as it does  you" replied her ladyship "for as he was not prepared for our coming as you see by his agreeble confusion we may be sure his caresses of the picture are  Warm from his heart and faithful to its fires  "Hey Henry" exclaimed Mr Clare "what signify your prosings to a bard caught in so poetical a situationThere's a quotation for him that describes him in his own wayFor my part I say nothingbut were I Olivia I should be little pleased with the cold compliment paid to my inanimate picture when the original stood blooming like the morning before him without his so much as offering to"  "Come madam" said Olivia "shall we go down stairs""With all my heart my dear" answered Lady Fitzorton"Mr Clare  will  have his joke you know"  "You'll follow Henry" said Olivia blushing delightfully and tripping down stairs "Is your friend Charles come and pray  how fares my sweet playfellow my sweet friend"  Olivia recollected it might not be quite prudent to mention Caroline's name at that instant and so made the best of her way  Henry had seldom been thrown into a more aukward situation The mistake of the miniature which on being discovered he put hastily out of sight was so extremely natural and so impossible to be then explained that he was utterly confounded and his complexion now almost as nearly resembled the carnation as Olivia's a circumstance which literally gave a still stronger  colour  to the supposition that the picture he had been so transported with was the one that Olivia had presented  What became of little Fitz we never heard but it is probable he had shyed off at the sight of so much unexpected company for he had naturally more diffidence than belongs to favourites in general whether of the biped or quadruped kind But indeed he might very possibly have been at Henry's feet and not noticed by either of the parties in their  confusion and for the moment Henry himself forgot perhaps that this "dear little soul whom he preferred to created nature" had any existence within the bounds of the universe Be that as it may Henry went down to breakfastbut from what happened afterwardsand indeed from what might be expected to happen from the questions which would arise on the unexpected sight of such a guestwe are rather inclined to think Henry did not perceive his companion till it was too late Of this the reader will presently form his own judgment  CHAPTER XXX  SIR ARMINE FITZORTON who stood in the great hall which led from the chambers to several of the apartments encountered Henry as he came down stairs and received him with an ardour of affection and applause to which nothing but Henry's consciousness of not deserving it could have rendered him insensible  "It is surely decreed" said Sir Armine  embracing Henry "that my life is to be preserved by one or other of my children Twice has it already been in danger and twice have my sons rescued meHere Henry is the accursed scroll whose contents had they been true would have been far more fatal than the injury which this aged frame received from Sir Guise Stuart's horse for I am convinced they would have broken mine and your mother's heartHenry therefore merits in a still greater degree even than our beloved John the title of  his Parent's Preserver  I am grateful and I am happy"  The venerable man threw his arms round Henry's neck and wepta circumstance no way inconsistent with the transport either of gratitude or happiness and which nature often adduces in proof of both  The heart of Henry though throbbing with love for Caroline was by no means unmoved by such an appeal to it It is more than probable indeed that at such a moment his heart had little to do with Caroline or with any thing in this world but with the sacred object in his embrace  "Oh Sir" exclaimed he "I cannot indeed I cannot bear it Spare me I conjure you for I feel powerfully that these tears and the goodness which occasions them will be more fatal than that paper whatever it may suggestI cannot speakmy dear  dear  father I cannot speak"  "I perceive my child thou canst notBlessings upon thee Let us hasten then to those whose affection for you is equal to my own"  They proceeded towards the breakfast parlour the door of which was at that moment opened by Olivia who began to be impatient of Henry's delay"Your tea will be quite cold gentlemen" said she complainingly  Sir Armine turned his face gently from her and said "Give me your hand Olivia and let us take a turn or two before we go inThere Henry do you follow my example"  Henry took the other hand and they all three traversed the hall for the space of some  minutesSir Armine attempting to hide strong emotions and Henry labouring in the same way Both were unsuccessful Olivia perceived they had been in tears and indeed still discovered some which had lodged in the furrows of Sir Armine's cheek  "Heavens" said she "what can these mean" wiping them softly away with the back of her hand"and yours Henry are not quite dry" said she removing them by the like action  "Why should we endeavour my son to conceal the effects of our transport from any one but least of all from her who has a right to share themDaughter" continued Sir Armine "what you have noticed in our countenances has been produced by the joy of our heartsand it was churlish in us to wish to rob you of your just division This our Henry hasbut no matterI charge you to love him better than ever and if he proves to you as good a husband as he has done to me a sonas  I  am thereby  the happiest of fathers so will  you  be the most blessed of wives Ask no more questions but let us to breakfast"  "It is very unfair however of you" said Olivia with all imaginable sweetness as if betwixt sport and earnest "to have all this transport to yourselves for I would have you to know I am as fond of weeping for joy as either of you and am now almost ready to cry with grief at your cheating me in this cruel manner And as to being more fond of this creature than I ever was before I am sorry Sir at the necessity of disobeying you in this particular for he very well knows thatthat"  "Knows what" questioned Sir Armine  "That it is impossible" whispered she but the whisper was conveyed in another of those stage tones which have so amply been discussed in one of the family conversations for when she mentioned to Sir Armine the impossibility of loving Henry  better  than she had done she certainly intended her lover should hear Indeed she resigned her hand to his caresses while this reason was communicated  and gliding herself between Henry and Sir Arminethe former in almost an oblivion of every thing but his filial loveshe drew them into the apartment  As they entered little Fitz had placed himself in Olivia's chair and thinking perhaps he had waited long enough for his breakfast was helping himself very cordially to some bread and butter that stood commodiously near himLady Fitzorton and Mr Clare having entered into a serious t√™te√†t√™te at the other end of the room  Olivia therefore running to him said "Oh but I forgot Henry to tell you about this dear little doghe is quite taken with meI think he likes the castle better than the abbeyWhat is his nameI see by the collar he belongs totototo"  Olivia checked herself on a cautionary hint from Henry and though she could not guess the motive of that hint as the name of the dog's owner was no longer proscribed her Henry's wishes were always followed by prompt and smiling obedience  As Sir Armine advanced towards little  Fitz Henry's agitation was so extreme he involuntarily took hold of his father's coat to prevent his examining the collar  Olivia was taken up with considering the beauty of the animal so that Henry's situation escaped herbut Sir Armine gave him such an interrogating look as sent his very blood into his face to answer it  "Let  me  see Olivia" said Sir Armine stooping down as if to read the engraved letters  "Indeed you must not Sir" cried Olivia turning the collar round till the engraved part was hid under the dog's throat"Dear Sir he does not choose to tell the name of his owner besides 'tis a Family Secretor perhaps he means to change his situation"  "Then he ought to bring a character from his last place" said Lady Fitzorton now first joining in the discourse  "Very true" said Mr Clare"so pray Mr what'syourname whom do you belong to"  "Don't mention Sir Guise say he belongs  to Caroline"whispered Olivia to Henry "andand"  Judge reader if this was not helping this lame dog over the stile with a vengeance  "If you must know"said Olivia"the little fellow belongs to Miss Stuart only you know we are not to talk about it as perhaps some other person's name may be on the collarand though I know you are all too good 'to turn your  enemy's  dog out of doors'without his breakfast IIin short I had half a mind to steal him and love him for his mistresses sake"  "If you will but help me out this will do nicely"added Olivia to Henry  not  in a stage whisper  "Miss Stuart"said Mr Clare"then you ought I am sure to be jealous either of the dog or his mistress for I saw Henry almost devouring him with kisses"  "And I could kiss him myself"said Olivia"for he's a dear and a love and if I did not think it would break Miss Stuart's heart I  would  steal him Yes I would you dear thing" added Olivia renewing her caresses  "not that I saw Henry kiss him at allIt was something else I saw him kiss"  The bloom which accompanied this observation covered the cheeks of Olivia and was inexpressibly beautiful  "Admitted" said MrClare pleasantly"but methinks a lover of mine would not a little anger me if he were to salute the prettiest cur in the world and my picture in the same breathhowever as that is your business not mine you must e'en settle it between you"  "Let you and I Lady Fitzorton finish our breakfast as fast as we can and go on with our conversation which as is but too often the case a puppy in favour has interrupted"  With all these reliefs Henry had collection enough to say the dog was a favourite at the abbey from whence it had followed him as it had done more than once before though not perhaps noticedbut that as often as it did he sent it back immediately knowing what search there would be after it  as he should have done now had he discovered it in time  Henry now patted the dog's headand said "he supposed if he did not send or take it back soon there would be a searchwarrant after it"  Breakfast now went on smoothly except that Sir Armine and Henry rather overacted their partsthe former being too talkative and the latter too taciturnyet both equally anxious to conceal their sensations  The engraving luckily escapedfor the collar bore these words"LITTLE FITZ the gift of HENRY TO CAROLINE"  Mr Clare and Lady Fitzorton disappearedOlivia soon followed and ran up stairs with the spaniel in her armsand almost in the same instant she had so done True George came whistling through the hall calling at every step "Little Fitzlittle Fitz"The door of the breakfast parlour being left open George came to the threshold put his head into the room still whistling for and calling after little Fitz  "What's that you say"questioned Sir Armine"about Fitz"  George instantly perceived his error and trying to repair it answered"Nothing an't please your honourbut that I was looking for the litle spaniel that had strayed from the abbey and I was saying to myself says I God forgive me for fibbing  aside  if he should be lost the person he belongs to might go into  fits  that's all your honourandandJenny Atwood said'she thought she knew the dog andand had a bit of a fancy to see him again'your honourthat's all"  "And that's enough" said Sir Armine"go and shut the door after you"  George obeyed the word of command in much perturbation  Sir Armine spoke sternly and rose himself to shut the door even while he was giving orders  CHAPTER XXXI  "HENRY I wish to look at Olivia's miniaturethat which John painted for you"  Forgetting perhaps in his confusion he had left it with Caroline for a purpose the reader may remember Henry put his hand into his pocket as if to feel for it and not finding it there his agitation increased  "IIImust have left it Sir" stammered Henry  "I mean that" said Sir Armine "on which you bestowed as your mother told me so many caresses this morning"  "That Sir" cried Henry his breath almost gone  "The same" rejoined his father"Mr Clare asserted you have heard it more than divided with you the fondness you discovered for Miss Stuart's spaniel"  "Heaven Sir what a comparison" said Henry with vehemence"Spaniel"  "Yes little  Fitz  " observed Sir Armine looking searchingly at Henry  "But to leave comparisons fetch me the pictureperhaps it may be left in your chamber it may be even at this moment on your pillowIt ought by the laws of love let the original be who she may"here his eyes seemed to penetrate into the very heart of his son"it ought I say to be always within reach of your lips Perhaps it is so nowyour bosom companion Let us see and pray sir what is this"  His father pointed to a small piece of ribbon which had perhaps in his endeavour to conceal it from the party who surprised him at his chamber door insinuated itself on the wrong side of Henry's shirt and pulling at it abruptly that bosomsecret which had literally been so long suspended would then have come forth and Caroline's wellpainted resemblance stood confessed had not a little contest ensued between the parties  Henry defended the passes to his breast with his hand which grasped the frill of his  shirt and perhaps the mystery underneath it  Sir Armine renewed the attack saying sarcastically"What can be the meaning of all thisIs it not Olivia'sIs it not the 'counterfeit presentment' of one who is alike dear to us bothThe fair object of the father's choice as well as the son's what other  could  be cherished in Henry's bosomIs it not Olivia Clare's and if I am any longer denied the pleasure of paying it my tender respects I shall ring for Olivia herself and ask her consent"  Sir Armine without letting go his hold made a step or two towards the bell  Henry aiding his father's intentions tore open his shirt in a kind of phrenzy and cried "It mustit must be explained The hour is comethank heaven the hour is comeI am the sport of every accident and will here accumulate or put an end to my misery and all its mysteries at once"  "Have a care" said his father preventing Henry's design"have a care your father's happiness your father's life and  not singly his but the happiness and life of a man venerable as myself of  her  likewise who gave life to youand more than the existence probably the selfdestruction of the innocent Olivia"  Sir Armine panted and paused  "These my son are in your hands as entirely as if you were our fateBeware thenI tremble at the omens I have just seenDeep plots are discovered by trifling occurrencesHeaven forbid I should be right in my present forebodingsoh if I were"  Sir Armine's looks and accents seemed to anticipate and confirm the sentiments he was about to utter  "If I were loss of fortune and of life would be as the  tender mercies  of God compared to what is reserved for the houses of Clare and Fitzorton"  Henry falling at Sir Armine's feet exclaimed "That God is my witness Sirif the loss of  my  life could prolong the happiness of yours and of my mother's  but one day  with a prayer as earnest as ever came  from the heart of man I would invoke my death this momentinvoke it thus on my knees a posture befitting a son to receive itBut there are circumstances which would make my existence so hateful so dishonourable in my own eyesThis picture sir could it speak" Here he drew it half from his bosom  "Forbear Henry forbear" answered Sir Armine closing his eyes and averting his head"I will not look on any thing that may"  "I have forborne too long" resumed the madding Henry"enthralled by inexplicable events I have been too long involved in a thorny labyrinthand this O my honoured my almost adored fatherthis is the crisis at which I must  force  my way out of itHear me sir hear me with patience pity and parental love while I confesswhile I explain by what a series of unavoidable delays entanglements and almost more than human interventions I have day after day onward to weeks months yearsto the desolation of health happiness  all offices all studies even the most sacred"  "Henry" interposed Sir Armine"let me not listen to what would must and ought to turn that heart against youwhere perhaps I ought to blush while I confess  you  have been from the hour of your birth to this moment the most cherished of human beingsIf you have in your bosom any passion which has made its way by stealth to effect the havoc of soul and body and derange every pursuit of duty and devotionand if you rashly carry the resemblance of the unhappy illfated object of that passion in your breastlet the consideration you owe to the united lives and fortunes of united familiesto your religion and to your God whose ministry you have promised to assist though even that promise seems forgottenlet all these sacred motives aid you to expel the intruder"  "I was silent sir" interrupted Henry"because I could not explainbut I did not promise"  "It is still in your power to derive additional  virtue from the very sufferings by which such complicated misery to the aged and to the young may be prevented" resumed Sir Armine"For my own part I here declare to you dearest Henry that were my individual felicity were my single life the only points of destruction which would result from what I tremble to name I would give up that felicity and that life a sacrifice to youa willing sacrifice  "It is enough my son I will not expatiate I will not remonstrate or reasonAny attempt to subdue you by the force of argument would lessen you in your own eyes even more perhaps than they would disgrace you in mineI would rather leave every thing to your own graceful duty and good principlesand that I may give you an opportunity of exerting these I thus raise you from the earth fold you in my arms and leave with you  in trust  whatall that ought to be most important to you on earth"  In vain did Henry attempt to detain his fatherin vain did he struggle in his embracesin vain lift up his streaming eyes  and exclaim "Cruel cruel perversity of fortuneDetested dissensions which have thus placed one duty in opposition to anotherAccursed domestic feuds which set even the virtues at variance with each other"  At the end of these disordered and almost frantic ejaculations Sir Armine cried out "I have heard too muchHalf of this indecent violence would distract the rest of my family and murder Olivia"  He then rushed out of the roomperhaps forgetting he had been exhausting himself in similar paroxysms  CHAPTER XXXII  BY means so apparently insignificant was this longdelayed and longprojected discovery brought about and Sir Armine was strongly confirmed in all his former suspicions by the simple circumstances of the miniature and the spaniel  Thus bad begun and worse remained behind  for Henry had hereby also more fully convinced himself that the disclosure was likely to be attended in its progress through the families with worse mischiefs than had resulted to them or to him even from the concealment disastrous as it had been  But one of these mischiefmakers namely little Fitz was destined to be the small but important instrument of several other discoveriesfor while Henry was in the midst of the above distressing reflections Olivia and her canine companion with whom she was by this time on the best terms possible returned into the breakfast parlour where she no sooner perceived Henry alone than she took up the dog in her arms and said "Do you know my dear Henry that this little fellow had like to have thrown poor Jane Atwood into hystericsHe followed me into her sittingroom where she and your good George were t√™te√†t√™te and on perceiving the dog she caught him up kissed him as much as we have done and said 'it was the very spaniel that was with Miss Stuart when  she and Sir Guise paid her a visit in London and that she heard Caroline say she would not have any thing happen to it for half her father's estate' adding that it followed her wherever she went and shared her very bed'But I have another reason for loving it' said Jane 'Pray pardon me miss but what is constantly in the sight ofofof an absent friend you know miss is always dear to us'Her hesitation made it difficult for her to speak  "I declare Henry when I heard the poor girl say thisthough I was sorry for having been the occasion of her shedding tears on a subject I have constantly endeavoured to keep out of her mindI loved her the better for her tenderness though I knew it was improper for her to indulge itAh I know by my own feelings" continued Olivia "that had you but touched a flower a leaf or the most trivial thing you can imagine my fancy and heart would hold it consecrated from that momentand indeed it would be estimable beyond  all price This locket for instancethough that is not a well chosen example either because it is not a trifle and is very dear I have assured it of my affection a thousand thousand times"Here she took what she described from her lovely bosom and forgot most likely for the instant that little Fitz was in the world  "I have heard or read Henry" continued she "that it is unsafe or unwisesome have pronounced it foolish and philosophers I am told have called it indelicatefor a woman to express the extent of her tenderness to the man she loves even if he be most amiableNow that has always appeared very strange for it is one of the sweetest I feel likewise it is one of the most innocent pleasures of  my  life to declare how much I esteem love and honour my dearest HenryWhere can be the peril of trusting with all his powers the man who has long given you an equal degree of confidence and affection in returnI should hate myself if situated as we are I could  coldly repress a sentiment the declaration of which might produce to Henry but the smallest added proof of my attachment  "But how I am running onI know not whether you ought to be angry or love me the better for itDo set me right decide for me Henry"  Before this question could be replied to True George came to say Lieutenant Stuart was in the blue room and begged to speak to Squire Henry before he paid his respects to the family  "Run to him this moment" replied Olivia"I see Henry you are out of spiritsHe and I will make you quite well and happy and if he assists me in doing that I will forgive him even for robbing me of this little fellowfor I foresee he will take him  "But alas he is you say out of spirits too then I will nurse and comfort you bothBe very particular in your enquiries about Caroline HenryI suppose he is just come down but you drive every thing except yourself out of my headI forgot that you must have seen him last night at the abbeyI wonder what he can have to  say to you aloneShall I leave the dogNohe  will  go with me you seeI declare Caroline would be jealous of me if she were to know itIf you had but seen the face of True George when Jane fondled the dog'I have no notion of people kissing puppy dogs' muttered he'they could do no more to christians'But suppose we take off the little fellow's collarthen you know Sir Armine" Henry caught at the hintslipped the strap from the buckle and put the telltale in his pocket  "Delightful" cried the unsuspicious Olivia"Now I think we shall be a match for the old gentleman's curiosity But I have forgot to look myselflet me seenonow I think of it your friend is waiting for you while I am prating" She then exultingly left the room  The meeting of Charles and Henry was extremely affecting They ran into each other's arms and forgot for a while their sorrows in their embraces  "Beloved unhappy friend" cried Charles"I feel that even hopeless love since you must have been innocent of my  despair would have wanted power to dissolve our friendshipDissolve itNo my poor breaking heart would rather have flown to that friendship for succour and support as the only good it could expect in the hour of its despair  "But I do  not  despair Henry for although I have heard seen and read all that might be distracting on this subject my friend"Charles here held out a letter"still our fate is suspended by one precious hope"  "On that letter" questioned Henry  "From my father" replied Charles"It proposes in a language so humiliating indeed that though as I said all depends thereon I am at a loss whether as a son I ought to be the bearerIt proposes Henry an accommodation between our houses on your father's own termsIt paints in glowing colours regret for our long dissensions and holds out a general amnesty to each offending party  "Whatever be the result" continued Charles"the motive which led Sir Guise to this signal kindness has more than  atoned for all that I have suffered from his former conduct and though I greatly fear because I greatly love lest his generous effort should be in vainI shall remember the intention with my dying breathYet wherefore should I entertain an unworthy doubt of the successIf the aggressor can sue for pardon the man whom he has offended can much more easily forget his wrongsand Sir Armine Fitzorton I trust"  "Alas" interposed Henry "I have to paint a scene which blasts that hope in the bud"  He now related what had recently past with Sir Armine in consequence of the discoveries brought about by Caroline's miniature and little Fitz and added thereto by way of filling up the gap in their history all that had fallen out to oppose the progress of their illfated loves since they parted  When he had closed the narrativeat several passages in which Charles shuddered with apprehension especially at the proofs of Olivia's rooted attachment to his friend  though Henry mentioned as few instances of these and touched those few as lightly as possible  Charles exclaimed "Notwithstanding all this something whispers me a sudden and unforeseen good will result from the operation of this epistle on a heart so noble as your father's Consider my friend we live in a world of wonderful revolutions and amongst the infinity of changes and chances that surround us on all hands who can tell but from this source may spring my happiness with Olivia and yours with Caroline"  Until the mention of Caroline's name as a party in this matter Henry notwithstanding the constitutional and habitual intemperance of all his feelings could not help considering his friend's hopes as the mere offspring of a mind violently agitated by the passion that most strongly believes it can reconcile impossibilities but now he found out all at once there was much sound reasoning in his friend's observations  and he indulged a credulity that shewed he was again in a disposition to believe every thing practicable which favoured his ruling passion He exclaimed "Oh my friend if the exertions of your now generous father should have influence with mineand if the same kind star that induced the divine Caroline to look favourably on me should dispose the gentle Olivia at length to incline an auspicious ear to the suit of my friend"  "O if such bliss should be in store for us" interrupted Charles "for I can with truth inform you Henry that my sister's affection for you in despite of all that has past is greater thanin short nothing but the returns which are made by your own heartand the ardent and unspeakable tenderness with which mine throbs for Olivia can truly indicate how much you are beloved by Caroline Stuart"  "Let us lose no time" exclaimed Henry with the utmost impatience "Sir Armine ought to have had the important letter long ago Give it me my friendnodeliver  it yourselfYet that may not be rightLet us think a moment what is best to be done"  A gentle tap was now given at the door on opening which a voice more gentle than the summons said"Forgive my interruption of you dear friends but I long to ask Mr Stuart how he does and it is not fair of you Henry to keep him all to yourself in this manner when I will answer for the whole family being rejoiced to see himas well as this little fellow" pointing to Fitz"who you see asserts his claims to a share of his company as well as you Mr Henry"  This sportive reproach ensured the fair speaker a cordial welcome and both the friends seemed to be animated by the same sentiment namely that of making Olivia a party in the reconciliation for they both exclaimed at the same instant with very little variation in the expression and both with equal fervour "Good Heaven who so proper so likely as Miss Clare to assist us with her counsel in this exigence"  "I beg" repeated Olivia "instantly to be made acquainted with the nature of it if either of you suppose there is a probability of my being useful" Henry perceiving his friend too much agitated by the presence of his beloved mistress to proceed informed Olivia of Sir Guise's wish of being reconciled to the family and his almost supplicatory letter to effect it  "And who can tell lovely creature" said Charles almost forgetting himself "but that if it were presented and supported by such an advocate it might succeed and then"  "And then" exclaimed Olivia "it would make us three of the happiest of families in the world you know I dare say Mr Stuart your friend Henry who I suppose keeps nothing from you told you my heart throbs again to embrace my ever remembered Caroline Methinks I seel for her a sister's love""A sister's" ejaculated Charles "Good heavenswhat a thoughtI will pledge all my hopes of happiness here and hereafter she would rejoice  to call you by that endearing name""Do you think so" said Olivia"Then we shall be all as one family and this little fellow too" added she patting the dog upon the head"see here is the dear creature's spaniel Make much of him Mr StuartIf he could tell your sister how I have fondled himyou know the old proverbbut what have I to do with proverbs at such a time as thisI see you are both ready to quarrel with me for loitering on my commissionProsper it good heaven"  Give me the letter then this momentGive me the letter this moment" added Olivia taking it from the trembling Charles "and I could almost worship the hand of the bearer of such overtures"  The sweet girl held her own hand in a way that would have made a novice in the little courtesies of life understand that it might be seized with impunity Charles conveyed it in a disordered manner to his lips from which Olivia drew it away and left the room saying "You young soldiers  are so used to carry every thing by storm that the destined object of your attack has no hope of escaping when 'tis a poor damsel like myself but by running away"  Now though all this was only the play of a friendly and benevolent heart happy at every prospect of promoting happiness and at being chosen as the instrument to reconcile alienated minds the two friends were no sooner left again to a t√™te√†t√™te than they derived even from the alacrity of their embassadress a fresh supply of hopes that fortune was turning in their favour  Charles was too much transported with his having almost for the first time ravished or rather received as a freewilloffering the beautiful hand of his mistress to think of or feel any thing but the tumult into which it had thrown himHe therefore only seized the hand of his friend and carrying it to that side where nature has thought proper to place the hearthe cried"God of feeling how it beatsdid you ever feel any thing like it Henry" To which question  his friend observed in the words of his favourite Shakespeare  There is a tide in the affairs of men  perhaps Charles we have now taken it  at the flood  and if so  It will lead on to more than fortune  In honest prose his friend assured him he was almost weak enough to subscribe to his opinion They then proceeded to increase this delightful phrenzy by every means in their power Superstition itself is not more credulous than love when in the very bosom of despair hope as if by stealth darts but one ray upon it  "And if after all our disappointments" cried Henry whose heart was an admirable sophist and could when warmed overturn the most elaborate philosophy and reasoning "if after all our miseries this unexpected chance should be the groundwork of that temple of felicity to which we might  at length conduct our destined bridesshall we not"  "Shall we not both go out of our senses with joy" questioned Charles "Brides O Henry how often have we known one happy change lead on and prove as it were the harbinger to another And when Fortune  does  bring her atonements she is frequently like a long tyrannous but at length yielding mistress as kind as she had been cruel"  The selfdeluding friends then enumerated all the instances their memories could furnish of one unexpected piece of good luck producing or having been followed up by others no less unlooked for Charles related a story of two young people coming together whose parents friends and fortunes were all in opposition to their dearest hopes  Henry bringing the matter more into point said he had read somewhere the history of a lady in love with a gentleman whose heart was otherwise engaged notwithstanding which after a course of hopeless years she was married to the object of her affections  by an accident that had induced the gentleman to transfer his passion from his former love  "And why should not this be the ultimate event in the case of Charles and Olivia"  Such was the romance of their hearts that they could not stop or indeed stoop to examine whether this was not a mere rhapsody of the affections in the heyday of youthful blood Indeed the wisdom of reason and of common sense is so unwelcome and disgusting to lovers of this character when the heart is in this sort of delirium that it sincerely adopts the maxim of the poet by pronouncing it "folly to be wise"  CHAPTER XXXIII  To this delusion of a fond and lovesick imagination then did Henry and his friend deliver themselves up so entirely that they had sketched out and communicated to each other several of the delicious plans of happiness which it was agreed upon should  take place when Charles became the husband of Olivia and Henry of Caroline The soul of poesy was at work in the bosom of Henry His fancy performed miracles His head and heart were both on fire The enraptured Charles caught the flame and both enjoyed  Those painted clouds that beautify our days  while reason halfblushing halfsmiling withdrew and that species of madness which indeed can never endure so stern a power resumed its reign The prospect of felicity seemed to approximate as our young friends looked upon it and to brighten as it advanced all the impediments which had so long stood like a dead wall of separation betwixt the abbey and castle were by the help of reconciling fancy removed and in its stead 'a verdant wall' like that of paradise upreared its florid head The turrets seemed to smile on each otherthe trees on each estate appeared once more to form their branches into truelover's knots and  extend their 'marriageable arms' till they embraced both houses the very flowers of the different gardens were as by instinctive amity disposed to waft fragrance to each other 'stealing and giving odours' and that this courtesy might be the more expeditiously done Henry's muse was commanded to create a Zephyr on purpose commissioned to bear upon his balmy wing the rosy sweets of Fitzorton to the abbey and with no less celerity to fly back with the violet perfumes of Stuart Meantime Henry had stationed the Loves and Graces of which he had a warehouse in different parts of the groves and gardens to twist flowers and wreathe chaplets to adorn the brows of Caroline and Olivia Nay he had placed Cupid in one part of the forest aiming a new dart at the tender bosom of Olivia in favour of Charles and had set old Hymen at work in the sacred form of Sir Armine to build a nuptial bower to be ready for that double marriage which was to complete such infinity of happiness  Shouldst thou reader be either a poet  a lover or both thou wilt here exclaim "if this be madness let me rave"but if thou art a reasoning being and wise that is cold enough to keep the track of common sense thou wilt pity or despise those distracted daydreamers and not being able to conceive any happiness in such phrenzy think Bedlam or St Luke's the only places proper to hold our two frantic young gentlemen  Now as the frozen Caucasus and the burning Aetna do really exist in the natural world so do these opposite degrees of heat and cold in the human temperamentand as it would be no less impossible to convince thee of even the transitory rapture of being mentally distracted than to persuade the man of sanguine dispositiona Charles or a Henrythere was infinite gratification in carrying a lump of unthawed ice in the bosom by way of a heartwe shall attempt no means of reconciling such extremessatisfied in our own mind that intense heat and cold have their separate and peculiar use in the little globe of man's nature  no less than in that great globe the world itself  Thou knowest reader that Greenland is a perfect bagnio to the temperature of the planet Saturn to whom the sun himself appears but as a little pallid star and that its inhabitants would expire with heat in our coldest countrieswhile on the other hand Mercury is so full of fire that the heat to which its supposed natives are accustomed is so excessive that the most glorious day here would be to them no more than declining twilight and they would be frozen to death in the torrid zoneIf thou art  saturnine  therefore thou wilt not hesitate to pronounce our  mercurial  sparks absolutely mad and sit only to live in that planet which has been called the bedlam of the spheres  Yet grudge not Henry or his friend the momentary bliss they derived from this flame of their fancy although it may have raged in contrast with thy more sober matteroffact sensationsIt was but as a meteor of the night that appeared and passed away making the darkness that followed  the more horrible from the gleam and its coruscationsAlas while these children of imagination were triumphing in the visionary happiness that blazed about their eyes reason and common sense assuming soon the shapes of a father and mother entered the apartmentSir Armine held the opened letter of Sir Guise in his hand"I suppose" said he addressing the youths"you are both acquainted with the contents your friendship no doubt indulges unlimited confidence and I take it for granted whatever is imparted to one is in effect communicated to both"  Upon Henry's assuring him he had not seen the letter and that his friend had only partially mentioned the general purport Sir Armine gave it to Henry desiring him to read it aloud  TO SIR ARMINE FITZORTON BART  Dear and longoffended neighbour  THIS method of beginning may indicate the friendly disposition under which  I writeBoth our sons as well as ourselves are the victims of our antipathyThey have pleaded so often for our reconcilement that I am unable any longer to resist their amicable intercessionsThe bond of union may perhaps through the medium of our children be yet more cemented between our families after this reconciliation than if no fatal breach had ever happened  "What does that mean" questioned Lady Fitzorton looking at Henry  Henry directed his eyes to Charles for the materials of an answerbut not finding any was silent and embarrassed for Charles was at that instant consulting for a like reason the countenance of Henry  "Proceed with the letter" said Sir Armine  "But more powerful advocates than even our sons have pleaded for putting an end to our family feudsConscious feelings my good neighbour urge me to seek reconciliationI have liftedO it was foul my hand against mine ancient friend  and I could even humble my unworthy self in the dust of the earth"  "Should that have been saidat least in that groveling wayby the father of a soldier" asked Sir Armine darting his eye on Charles  Charles blushed  "Young soldier" said Sir Armine "let us quit this letter it will agonize you more than any wounds you could receive in the defence of your country I desire to converse with you on another subjectDirectly and at once therefore I shall demand of you in the presence of my wife who has an equal interest in the matter whether you have any knowledge of a correspondence which is said to subsist between your sister Miss Stuart and your friend here"  "He has Sir" answered Henry relieving Charles who stood irresolute"He has the most perfect knowledge of it and has done his utmost to"  "Not to promote it certainly" interrupted Sir Armine"He is of an honourable  profession and incapable of clandestine baseness"  "Baseness Sir" exclaimed Charles reddening  "Yes young man" returned Sir Armine"It would be the last excess of baseness to aid and abet an intercourse which would render every individual of this house except that rash boy unhappy and make him ungrateful and infamous You are aware of your friend's solemn engagements to Oliviabut he neglects herhis friendshis relationshis God"  "Solemn engagements Sir" exclaimed Henry"I know not of any I ever made to that lady they have all been taken for grantedand whatever may be the issue I here disclaim themI here declare that my whole soul is has been and shall for ever be betrothed only to Caroline Stuarteven as firmly and irrevocably as is that of my friend Charles to"  Henry checked himself a moment and then proceeded  "Yes wherefore should a virtuous but  unfortunate passion be thus hid from those who ought earlier to have known it"  Lady Fitzorton perceiving the emotions of Sir Armine were swelling into one of those dreadful extremities that sometimes tyrannized his bosom would have drawn him out of the room and made signs of silence to Henry who too much stirred to regard them with his usual respect exclaimed"No madam silence has already wrought this mighty complication of mischief and mistake"  "Let me hear all let me hear all" cries Sir Armine his articulation almost buried in his sensations  "It is heard in a sentence" replied Henry throwing himself at his mother's feet"The sister of my friend is not more precious to your son than is Olivia Clare to  "To whom" questioned Sir Armine staring wildly and stammering violently  "To the unhappy wretch who now throws himself upon your mercy" answered Charles falling on his knees before Sir Armine"Miserable that I amthe flame  has long been consuming my vitals and the life and death of us all depend upon some sudden changes in our favour"  "A sudden change will soon take place" exclaimed Lady Fitzorton"Look at my poor husband you have already deprived him of speechyou will destroy him between you but his death shall be upon your heads"  "I shall not die" said Sir Armine exerting himself after a deep struggle that shook his venerable frame as if he were contending with death himself"I will not die the young assassins shall not have that satisfaction"He paused for breath  "Then I am to understand Sir" continued Sir Armine recovering his utterance and staggering towards Charles "that you and my son have availed yourselves of my permission to carry on your friendship for each other independent of my just resentment  elsewhere  I say I am to understand"  "No Sir" interposed Charles still keeping his humble posture"I have never yet  dared to breathe my unhappy passion for Miss Clare to herself or to any other person but my friend till within these few hours Even the sister of my heart from whom nothing was ever shut out before did not suspect it"  "That is still something" answered Sir Armine in a tone much softened  Henry still kneeling perceived the favourable moment and applied his whole artillery of moving eloquence in the cause of himself and friendHe briefly recapitulated the most important parts of the mysterious history of their unhappy loveshe set the honour generosity and heroic virtues of Charles in the most affecting points of view and concluded his harangue by observing while he held the lieutenant by the handthat if his father and mother were disposed to prevent unheardof horror from overwhelming all parties it could be done only by devising some means to bring about the double nuptials on which they had set their hearts"any thing short of which" says Henry "I foresee will bring  desolation upon the three housesdesolation which as an earthquake shall swallow them  Lady Fitzorton whose affections were much moved tenderly wept over the young men  Sir Armine gave a hand to each of the youths and raising them up addressed them trembling as he spake yet his manner and tone of voice determined  "Suspect your enemy when he brings gifts and have a doubly guarded eye upon your ancient foe when he suddenly changes his frowns into smiles are long established maximsHow far these are applicable to Sir Guise Stuart in his laboured professions I presume not to sayAs for you Charles when I have told you that added to former impediments you must pass to the arms of Olivia Clare through the blood of her father my own and the life of this afflicted womanI shall point to you the alternative of an honourable action which will justify the trust I have long reposed in  your assertions however I may suspect the asseveration of others"  Charles eagerly desired a farther explanation  "Save us dear youthsave yourself your sister and your bosom friend" said Sir Armine"by retreating from if you cannot conquer a passion which it is impossible without violating every law of friendship and hospitality to indulgenay which were it sanctioned by our united suffrages and assistance could not prosper with Olivia whose happiness and life are contracted to your friend"  Charles fetched a deep sigh and shook his head as if to express at once the difficulty of complying with the request and the too evident strength of argument in the observation  "Having done this" continued Sir Armine"your virtue will be complete for you will have done all that in you lies to alienate this infatuated boy from farther pursuit of a sister whose very tenderness in  this case calls upon you to rescue her from herselffor inasmuch as she loves must she be wretchedas it is no less impossible for her to be married to my son than for you to wed Mr Clare's daughterunless at the sacrifice of every thing in this world that ought most to be valued by an honest man"  Perceiving Charles was absorbed in grief and that Henry was about to speak  "As to you Henry I have to trouble you with a very few wordslet not your friend who I see is contending with himself but whose virtue will triumph in the endlet him not surpass youEmulate himYour parents aged and infirm are before youYour union with Miss Stuart would destroy both would murder Olivia and therefore make Caroline far more wretched than the disappointment of her passionDeardear sonchild of my heartmost favouredmost precioussave your family you know not half the claims that Olivia has upon you though you know they  are manifoldI will not in this moment disguise that her father has preserved yours preserved him from unexpected but utter ruinfrom imprisonmentBehold your weeping mother is borne down with sorrow with love with gratitudebehold she kneels kneels to her sonyour father joins her petitions in a posture no less suppliantmust we both supplicate in vainalas look upon us my son"  The venerable pair were almost suffocated with their sensations  Charles raised Lady Fitzorton  Henry lifted his father from the ground into his arms exclaiming as he held him in his embrace"Live live my fatherlet me alone be the sacrificeit shall be somost willingly will I be the victimDo with me as you both see fit" here he embraced his mother "dispose of my hand my life to your wishI will not murmur No destiny no agony can equal what I at this moment feel at seeing you in such a situation And yet my friendmy poor friend"  Henry left his mother and ran into the open arms of Charles  "Take no thought of me" exclaimed his friend "I cannot bear to witness much less to create a scene like that which yet pierces my soulI will banish myself for everMy own sword should end me if I could be the cause of such another to those who ought to have shut the door which they threw wide open to give me welcome"  "SirMadam" continued Charles "as Olivia knows not yet of my unhappy love I here swear to youalthough it may and I hope it will break my heartI swear nevernever"  "Charles" answered Sir Armine"I will have you bound only by the sacred ties of your own reason friendship and honourand thus from my inmost soul do I pour out my thanks"  "In which are included" said Lady Fitzorton "my heartfelt acknowledgments"  "My house is your own" cries Sir Armine "When your visits afflict you or interrupt the generous task you have imposed  on yourself you shall be free to depart unquestioned and whenever you return our smiles shall welcome youNeither shall Henry be restrained from the abbeyWe submit him to your protection to the guard of his own duty wisdom and virtue and to the sacred office for which he will now again prepare his head and heartwe yield him to the counsels of Caroline Stuart herself who from those traits of character and conduct you have at different times related will I am sure when you explain to her more fully  our  situations help useven against herself  "Another word and I have done" added Sir Armine"the care with which the fatal mysteries that have entangled us has been guarded from Olivia and her father my best benefactor my  preserver  I consider as more than chanceas providenceIf the peace of innocence be dear oh be jealous of dropping a hint that may lead to any discovery of what has past between us this dayBut let us part we may be surprisedDo not be seen at present  Henry and do you dear Charles take to your father my best acknowledgments of his letter to which I will return an early answerit shall be such I pledge myself as is consistent with the new system of goodwill I hope mutually sincere that again subsists between usbut in the meantime I wish you both to peruse this paper and to give me when opportunity favours your joint opinion of it"  "Hush I think I heard Olivia's voice" said Lady Fitzorton"I got her to write some visiting cards for our next week's annual party thinking she might be securely employed in that manner while our conversation which I foresaw would be interesting lastedperhaps she has finished and is returning"  "Let us separate" said Sir Armine who led Lady Fitzorton out of the room leaving Charles and Henry again together  CHAPTER XXXIV  DEPRIVED for some time of the power of speaking to each other Henry and Charles could only express by signs a mutual desire of perusing the paper left in their hands Henry opened it and found the obligation mentioned by his father  It consisted in Mr Clare's having advanced no less a sum than fifty thousand pounds to replace the amount of what Sir Armine had lost within the past week by the failure of a banker whose credit he had generously attempted to save in the hour of an exigence that threatened destruction to himself and a whole family  To prevent this threatened ruin Sir Armine who had been long in friendship with the banker put himself to the last difficulty but had scarce effected the accommodation before the banker was declared insolvent and the news getting air the person of whom Sir Armine borrowed the money  made sudden claim for a return of the sum which was only borrowed for one and twenty days to cover sudden losses which the banker had himself sustained In this extremity Sir Armine confided the case to Mr Clare who immediately deposited the money insisting it should not be considered as any part of Olivia's independent fortune but what it had been his solemn design out of his distinct property to leave to his oldest dearest friend in case he should be his survivor and if not to be divided equally between his young friends James and John  Mr Clare had farther said "that as Sir Armine had informed him he had no way of paying off the sum borrowed but by trenching on those independencies which though duteously surrendered he knew his old friend considered only as a more solemn trustthe advance of what he Mr Clare had  willed  to be presented after death would better be offered now which "you know my friend" added Mr Clare"will give me an opportunity of seeing an important  article of my last will and testament performed in my lifetimebesides making Olivia one of the happiest girls in the world for to tell you the truth this is one of her plans after I had thrice refused the offer of her own fortune but that I have determined must come clear to one whom I have long considered as her husband"  Both the young men were greatly affected at this act of generosity on the part of Mr Clare and were not so blinded by their passion as not to feel it was a natural and strong though not perhaps altogether justifiable inducement in Mr Fitzorton to promote the match between Henry and Oliviafor indeed there is not any degree of family distress though it may be pleaded as a palliative can be admitted as a justification  Following therefore the impulse of a similar sensation they mutually deplored the cruel destiny which did not give them an apparent pretence to censure the event of which they were to be the victimsOn the contrary they seemed to catch the  spirit of chivalry which characterized the action of the good old Clare and warming by degrees they worked themselves up to such a sense of the conduct they ought to pursue that each resolved to strong then the other to the performance of the promise made to Sir Armine and Lady Fitzorton  And thus for a time in this wellconducted victory over themselves they forgot that they were still passionate lovers  Alas how nature plays with her children She seems to rank them even amongst her sports  In the midst of all this heroism a small circumstance happened to convince the heroes that theoretical and practical philosophy are somewhat different  Charles had a glimpse of Olivia and Henry of Caroline's little spaniel exactly as they had settled their point of resolutionThe sight of these objects shook the goodly fabric which imagination had reared in their hearts and from the pride of victors they sunk in a moment to the condition of  the captive that had only been dreaming he was free  "Must I resign thee beautiful Olivia" sighed Charles"must I then relinquish the very hope of thy ever being mine"  "O thou envied little animal" exclaimed Henry to the spaniel"how wilt thou be fondled by my soul's dear Caroline while Imust no more indulge the thought even that I am beloved"  Then as if by sympathy both the youths embracing they came to another settled point namely that they were a couple of miserable fellows who had nothing left in the world that took the shape of consolation but that one was as wretched as the othera conclusion which though not perhaps strictly generous has been often thought comfortableproceeding possibly from a social idea for few can bear to be happy or sorrowful alone  Olivia and her canine companion soon joined the young gentlemenShe was delighted to see them hand in hand which she considered as the result of their mutual happiness  Her spaniel enraptured to behold two of his best friends leaped alternately upon them with every demonstration of gratitude and joy but more especially upon Henry who we believe was of the two the greater favourite and Henry in turn received him with undiminished affection and indeed appeared to be either for his own sake or some other person's more fond of him than ever  Olivia with an air of pleasantry counterfeiting mortification declared that "she should now in reality be jealous and would therefore the less reluctantly suffer Charles to take her rival back to his mistress "For" said she to Charles"you see plainly the little seducer receives Henry's first attentions and I shall presently be but a secondary objectTo confess the truth" said Olivia"I am a little jealous of you too Mr Stuart for you and your friend in your last interview with Sir Armine and Lady Fitzortonwho by the bye insidiously kept me out of their partyhave contrived to run away with their  hearts in a manner that throws poor Olivia and the rest of the family in shadow quite into the back ground of our domestic groupeNothing now forsooth but the praises of the two inseparables Henry and Charles has for the last half hour been heard through the castle'They are the best the noblest young men in the world' says the old lady 'Excellent youths' cries the old gentlemanWhy what have you done to deserve all these fine thingsBut do not tell meI hate secretsThe knowledge of them would only serve to increase my jealousy for I suppose I should have the mortification to find you have done every thing to effect the charming reconciliation which I find is to take place between our families and I have been only the lettercarrier you the ambassadorsAnd you are to know I am of so perverse a disposition that I quarrel with the happiness of my best friends unless I have been some way aye and  importantly  the medium"  The friends consulted each other's looks  "Yes you may plot and lay your wise heads together against a poor feeble woman" resumed Olivia"but I will have my revenge yet and with interest toofor when we are all again as we should be I am determined there shall not happen a single thought or word that shall make any one of us wish to part again except under the assurance of a speedy return to each other for the rest of our livesSo that being the case I shall now go to your father and mother whom I left in the garden Mr Henryand see if I can get back  some  of my stolen goodsa little bit of their hearts again  "Meantime" added she as she was quiting the apartment"do not forget Mr Stuart to tell your sister that if she be but half as happy as I am at the prospect of our amicable association she will be  almost  as blessed as I wish her to benot that I should be quite contented till she was as happy as myself eitherAs to you little Mr Fitzbut you know my mind already and so this parting caress and adieu sir"  Little is that reader skilled in the history of the human heart who cannot suggest to himself the additional dilemma into which the two friends were thrown by this animated harangue  When Olivia had departed Henry caught hold of little Fitz and turning to his friend observed "From the bottom of my soul my unhappy Charles I regret that you and I ever came into the world"  "Would to heaven we were both out of it my dear Henry" answered Charles  "If we were both dead all would be very well" said Henry  "You are perfectly in the right" answered Charles  Henry seemed solemnly to recur to a suspended idea The expressions were trite and if considered as the language of despairing lovers are ludicrous and unmeaningbut on the part of Henry they betrayed the image that was but too deeply rooted in his mind  The lie  tenant after a mournful pause observed that "as either way they must  be both miserable it would be better for only two persons to suffer than to increase the number of victims" Hereupon Henry who had been holding the silken ears of Caroline's spaniel to his cheek and wiping away the tears which had dropt upon them very gravely demanded of Charles "What was his opinion of suicide"  "To speak of it professionally I think it the worst sort of desertion and flying one's country" answered Charles"To speak of it morally I feel it to be sinfulin sorrow as in joy such have ever been my sentimentsI wish we were both in our graves my friend with all my soul but I do not hold it right to gratify this wish by shortening our lives Death would be a blessing but could it be purchased by an action accursed"  Henry gave a sort of dissentient shake of the head but dropt the subject  "I can endure this house no longer at present" said Charles"and will therefore go homebut without any hope of greater happiness when I get there"  "I will attend youpartofthe way" says Henry stammeringly dividing his sentence  They went out and little Fitz was still in the arms of Henry Scarce had they reached the park when Charles asked "Whether the family would not think it somewhat rude to go without his taking leaveVery ill bred certainly do not you think so my dear Henry"and he was walking again towards the house without waiting for Henry's reply Then as if changing his mind he turned and took the path to the abbey saying with a dejected voice "it was not material"  They now walked arm in arm and little Fitz being set down ranged the hedgerows and traversed the groundsfar the happiest being of the trio  They soon gained the nevertobeforgotten grand avenue from which the abbey and the castle could be viewed distinctly in all their partsIt would be no easy matter to decide whether Henry gazed more earnestly at the one or Charles at the  other They both stood fixed midway betwixt both edifices employing themselves with the view of objects in the most opposite directions and after feeding their separate unhappiness by all those tender thoughts which they had resolved but a few minutes before to consider as the forbidden fruit of their heart and therefore never to be tasted  Charles declared "That this nursing an unfortunate passion was extremely wrong and if they were wise they were now taking their last look of the devoted castle and the illfated abbey"  "Very true" said Henry"here then let usyesafter we have taken another look let us separateat least for the present No"added he"I will go with you my friend just as far as those trees on the leftfor thereand thenand then"  "Yes" observed Charles gazing  "True my friend andththethen"  Henry absolutely stuttered and was dragging at the arm of Charles as he spoke  Charles in the same degree hanging back as the other pressed forwards Just as this seesaw situation ended Charles recollected he had left his stick at the castle but protested "He would not lose it for the world It was a gift"One of his gloves too was missingThis indeed he had the instant before taken off and put into his pocketSo he strode back some paces pulling his friend whose turn it now was to linger behind"They will be taken care of" said Henry"You will walk over again soon you know ororor  I  can bringbringbring themmyselfto the abababbey"  "  I  walk over again to the castle  you  bring them to the abbeyAlas my friend have you so soon forgot our solemn resolutions Exert yourself" cried Charles"bravelyWhat a noble pile is Fitzorton Castle my friend"  "The abbey methinks is a more attractive objectsuch grandeur so many awful charmsso manyonly look at it as the sun falls on the western turretsa long  and eternal adieu thou sacred mansion farewel for ever"  Henry walked towards it with hasty strides all the while he was speaking"Yes Adieu thou venerable edifice whose very ruins are dear to my souland ye O conscious woods who have often witnessed my sighs and tears my fervent vows and bitter execrations against persecuting fortuneBut chiefly thou Oh heartenshrined bower"  Henry quickened his steps till he almost ran  "Thou receivedst my first trembling declarations of a passion that has not hitherto for one moment" continued he"and  shall  never quit my troubled breastand thou oh wellremembered tree whose tender bark is still I trust faithful to those names which alas must never never be united"  The spirits of passion and of poesy were now at work and Henry desirous that his feet and tongue should keep pace with each other had got to the side of the very tree  of which he had been so pathetically taking an everlasting leavewhen happeningthen for the first time since his soliloquy beganto recollect his friend he turned round and saw that no less distracted lover going as fast as his legs could carry him in the contrary direction towards the castle to bid as affectionate and as eternal an adieu to its appreciated objects  Henry exalted his voice and assured his friend "he was going the wrong way"which Charles retorted upon Henryand thus they stood for a considerable time hallooing and beckoning to each other each steady to follow that part of the compass to which his own affections pointed  Alas the abbey and castle were as the opposite poles Henry and his friend the attracted needles  CHAPTER XXXV  WHILE they were vibrating to their different points little Fitz whom fate seems to have intended as the small but  important instrument of many a great event in this history was heard to give tongue and chase a hare which he had started at full cry till all the woods of Stuart were made vocal with his musicThe animal took up the great avenue and seeing the unequal enemy she had to contend with rather played with her slender legs than put them on the stretch keeping only at a safe distance before the panting little Fitz as if she intended to afford him diversion  Henry taken by surprise though not a great admirer of the chase now followed the sport and by turning towards the same side of the hedge with the hare whenever she deviated from the track that led immediately to the abbey seemed to wish she would keep the straight road while Charles who came slowly after perhaps would have been better pleased had she taken her course towards the castle  It was however decreed that the abbey should now be the asylum for the poor hare and having reached the gate of entrance she sprung through a wellknown  meuse formed among some bushes that clustered at the bottom of the avenue and notwithstanding the utmost efforts of little Fitz was soon lost in the windings of the forest  The hue and cry of the spaniel however and of Henry who though on very different motives was not less vociferous had not only brought forth into the front garden that faced the grand avenue several other fourfooted lovers of the sport who swelled the thunder of the woods at they knew not what but alarmed Sir Guise honest Dennison and lastly Caroline herself who all ran to the iron railing to see what was the matter  Henry who was very conveniently for his embarrassment out of breath from his pursuit explained the circumstance and was relating the heroic achievements of little Fitzaccounting at the same time to Caroline for his delay when the courageous animal came panting into the garden where hardly finding breath to express his transports at being restored to  his mistress he threw himself on his side upon one of the grass plats and still the most happy of the groupe recovered his strength and spirits at leisure  Presently after arrived the tardy Charles and when Dennison had consulted the countenances of the whole company and seeing nothing there either particularly to delight or to distress him he patted little Fitz on the head telling him "Puss had led him a fine dance and like many other fine folks had made a fool of him at last" and with this pithy remark the good old man withdrew  There never perhaps was exhibited in any four faces more characteristic impatience than in those of the party then presentHenry and Charles to disguise their secret emotionsSir Guise and Caroline to discover them  This threw them all into very aukward situationsCaroline from certain clouds not unattended with showers that gathered and fell involuntarily on the features of Henry was afraid to ask any questions  and Charles whispering her not to be inquisitive observed that "Ill tidings always arrived too soon" augmented her distress  At length Sir Guise counterfeiting a generous anxiety to know the result of his advances to reconcilement and expatiating on the ardent desire he felt to complete the good work he had begun insisted upon his son's telling him "How his overtures had been received"  Charles made shift to acquaint him with the truth so far as his father was concernedhe said that "Sir Armine received them with proper kindness and would be as ready to conciliate as Sir Guise"  Henry finding that his friend got through this garbled relation but very lamely offered him a helping hand by taking up the narrative and carrying it on so far as had any relation to Olivia's amicable message to CarolineBut Henry was not more successful than his friend for though he likewise indulged pretty copiously in mental reservations the difficulty which he found  to separate what was unfit for communication from what might safely be divulged rendered the whole story so dismembered and incongruous that a far less discerning spectator than either the baronet or his daughter might easily conceive there was a great deal more hid than there had been discovered  Sir Guise therefore choosing to interpret their confusion to a dislike of relating all that had past thought fit to act the part of the man of violated feelings and nice honour and to exclaim "Very well I see how it isI have been insultedMy foolish goodnature has been rejectedI might have expected as much indeedBut you would overrule meYou know your influence and see the consequence of itHowever thank heaven I have the consolation to suffer this fresh outrage for my children's sake and so I submitBut methinks when I condescended to make the first advances towards the Castle your father young gentleman should not have  driven me back to the Abbey with disgrace or have himself retreated  Henry was about to reply and with some generous warmth in defence of his fatherfrom a tender love of whom no sufferings of his own though proceeding from that father could detach himwhen Charles who was a young man of high honour and exalted principles felt it an incumbent duty to take the justification of Sir Armine upon himself "Sir" said he "the overtures you offered were as I before observerd received with suitable kindness and I am convinced your visit will be returned with a confirmation of the most hospitable assurancesbut"  "But what" questioned Sir Guise  Henry who presaged some possible good from concealing and much positive mischief from divulging all that might naturally be supposed to follow observed in an abrupt manner that "nothing had passed between his father and friend any way inconsistent withthat isas to thathe only meanthe  could assure Sir Guise as to what had pastnothing material relative thereto he could take on himself to sayin regard to the circumstances which"  "Mr Fitzorton" interposed the baronet "your attempts to explain away the repulse I have met with from your family are as generous as they are unsatisfactory there is at the bottom of all this a something"  Caroline interrupted the father discussion of this matter by declaring she was suddenly seized with so dreadful a giddiness that if she did not hurry into the house she should certainly tumble Indeed her whole appearance but too clearly confirmed the description of her situation she was with difficulty conducted to the abbey under the supports of Henry and Charlesthe former pressing her to his heart and whispering a thousand tendernesses in her ear as they passed along to the total oblivion of every thing on earth but Caroline's anxiety and her brother scarce less affectionately tried to recover his sister's spirits for he now plainly saw that her disorder originated in the apprehensions  of her mind as to what had past at the castle  Sir Guise Stuart not being quite so much interested in or affected by these kind of disasters took a turn or two round the garden where we shall leave him to the only person he did really interest himself forto himself  His afflicted daughter now in a voice of woe and terror called upon Henry and her brother to unfold the dreadful mystery which lay hid behind or was partly seen struggling in their expressions "What new grief has befallen us" said she "it cannot surpass what my despair suggests and I conjure you both by friendship love duty and all that is dear to us reveal the whole I know not wherefore I am thus affected but I feel as if something more terrible than any thing I have yet endured was about to involve us all"  "No" said Henry dropping suddenly on his knee "No Caroline neither father nor fate itselfI here solemnly swear"  "Whatever be the nature of your oath it  must not be made" replied Caroline "nor could I hear it nowfor so great alas is my present weakness thatO my father why when I had yielded myself up to the cold mandates of despairwhy did you revive my hopesor how knowing as I did the many insurmountable evils which environ all of usah how could I be so franticso"  While she was proceeding in this apostrophe the venerable Dennison made his appearance bearing two letters one of which he delivered to Caroline the other he laid upon the table saying "it was for Sir Guise"  The baronet himself came in immediately after and Charles desiring Dennison to leave the room the rest of the party before assembled in the garden were now grouped in the great hall where Caroline it being the first apartment had rested  Although her strength appeared in the moment before to have left her she rallied sufficiently to break the seal of the abovementioned letter and was just about to read  the contents when Sir Guise having with no less curiosity opened that which had been directed to himself read aloud what followspremising "that it came from the castle and appeared to be written by Sir Armine Fitzorton"  Human attention or expectation never perhaps having been more fixed than during the perusal of this epistle we will assign it a distinct place  CHAPTER XXXVI  "SIR ARMINE FITZORTON and family receive Sir Guise Stuart's advances to reconciliation with all the attention due to them and although some domestic concerns prevented an immediate reply in writing proper acknowledgments were dispatched by our friend Charles whose many virtues we all hold in high regard and Sir Armine for himself and his family in which he includes by authority that of the Clares now assures  Sir Guise his welcome to the castle shall be no less cordial than they expect to find at the abbey and that the first visit shall be left to his own nomination as soon as he pleases after an event arranging between the families of Fitzorton and Clare has taken place which it is now expected to do in the course of a few days"  The consternation of Henry and Charles while the baronet read this card could be surpassed only by that which like a hurricane shook the frame of Caroline On hearing the last passage she dropt the paper which had long trembled in her hand upon the floor and sinking herself after it cried out in a feeble yet agonized and interrupted voice "Inafewaaveryfew days"  Henry's eye caught the superscription of the card which was addressed to Caroline and perceived the hand writing of Olivia He would hereupon have glided it into his pocket to prevent at least farther mischief But Sir Guise with a solicitude truly characteristic of  his  paternal feelingswounded no doubt at seeing his now beloved daughter  in such profound affiction observed that "as it was possible the contents of the second might serve as an antidote to the poison of the first paper he must gently insist on reading it"  Henry stood by Caroline's side hovering between sense and insanityCharles was in a kind of stupor perhaps at that time friendly to his reason and Caroline seemed to shudder betwixt life and death  TO MISS STUART  "THE customs of the world require that I should begin and end my introductory letter with certain prescriptive formalities but in the first place can I consider Caroline Stuart as a stranger when even in our almost infant days I bore to her a sister's love and have since been intimately acquainted with her virtues and as long have loved and honoured her for them And indeed I am so little an observer of etiquette where my affections are concerned that I should put the greatest restraint imaginable on those affections were I to clog them with  common ceremonies in this address which is simply to describe the happiness I feel in the longwished and longsought opportunity of making it consistently at once with my duty and love  Sir Guise paused  "I told you" said Sir Guise "the young lady would atone amply for the old gentlemanso let us go on"  "The prospect of our family reunion in which Caroline and Oliviapardon my boastshall be as sisters Henry and Charles as brothers and our parents scarcely distinguishable from each other is so delightful to me and is indeed a transport which has been so long watched wished and prayed for that you must pardon me if I forget not only the modes of the world but the world itself in the sensibility with which I reflect upon the completion of those wishes and prayers Almost in the instant of their being granted to me"  "Dear Sir Guise" said Henry "it is cruel to proceed when you see how your daughter and indeed all of us are afflicted"  "Afflicted" reiterated the baronet "surely there has nothing of an afflictive kind yet occurred and I therefore augur well of the rest"  "I entreat" said Caroline"that my father may be permitted to proceed"  Charles was silent  Sir Guise read on "I catch up the pen to inform my longloved Caroline of my happiness not only because I could not 'suffer the coldness of delay to hang on' such heartfelt tidings but because I cherish the hope that my felicity will be shared by Miss Stuart"  "Felicity" exclaimed Caroline  Henry who had taken advantage of this pause having cast his eye over the residue of Olivia's epistle which the baronet held carelessly down that he might the better observe on the parties took hold of the paper and cried "excuse me sirwe have heard too much alreadywhat remains I see is of no consequence So if you please we will"  "If you please Mr Fitzorton" answered Sir Guise pretending offence "we will go through the rest and form our own judgment of its consequence"  Charles and his sister seemed to anticipate the sentiments that were to follow in Henry's countenance which was at all times an expressive one and might now be said in Shakespeare's language "to be a book in which one might read strange matters" From their perusal of this they prepared themselves for something miserable  The baronet asserted that hitherto he saw nothing but what was in good train and proceeded thus "I must inform my dear CarolinethatthatI protest I hardly know how to write itthatafter a life of wooinga certain event is likely to take place between one of  my  familyandand one ofbut I understand Henry accompanied his friend home and as I suppose him to be still at the abbey I refer you to  him  for the particularsor if  he  refuses your brother may be applied to"  If the reader's own mind furnishes not a sketch of the situation of the trio most concerned in this intelligence and especially the reference to Henry and Charles we must fairly confess the inability of our pen to describe it  Sir Guise having insidiously made unobserved observations read on  "I only mention the circumstance as a tender thought at the moment of my writing steals into my heart purporting the honour and happiness I should derive had I the privileges of a friend to invite the gentle Caroline's service on an occasion whichin short as I said before not being able to consider her in any other light than an oldan intimatea bosom friendII"  Sir Guise masking a cruel purpose in kind expressions declared that "he feared what followed was coming rather too closely to the pointHowever" added the baronet "it is but another sentence the sooner an unpleasant thing was over the betterSuspense was the sorest of evils and he  would therefore get rid of the remainder as fast as possible" He then appeared to hurry over what follows  "I feel a degree of anxiety for which I cannot account that the I hope and trust in heaven most joyful day of my life even though I thus tremble at its approach should be distinguished by two of the greatest blessingsthe acquisition of ahow shall I name itof a tender husbandI can scarcely writeand the recovery of my earliest friendand this double felicity I am ambitious to mark by the latter undertaking the gentlest the most endearing office of friendship Ah cannot my Caroline conjecture what the tumult of my soul permits me not to"  "She wishes you to be one of her bridemaids I suppose" said Sir Guise affecting a bluntness for which almost in the commission of it he pretended to reproach himself  "Her bridemaid" ejaculated the trio at the same time"her bridemaid"  "That indeed is too much" said Sir Guise affecting to sympathise  "Damnation" exclaimed Charles rising and stamping as he walked toward the doorthen turned and taking Henry by the hand"yet God bless you together It must be so It oughtand I submitIIIdoMy friend farewel"  Caroline attempted to follow her brother's example but catching his arm as he was going she could only say"Itooresign myselfandandfrom my soulrepeat the benediction" She withdrew supported by Charles  "My dear Henry" said Sir Guise almost betraying his triumph in the attempt to refine upon it "you perceive I have done my utmostI have sought petitioned and almost prostrated myselfbut all in vain my children and myself remain unhappy and yet in this instance none of us perhaps can blame any of your family"  The baronet paused seeing Henry start from his seat seize his hair in desperation  and then striking his breast as he ejaculated "No my worthy friend it is not you nor any body elseit is the work of my own cursed cursed fortune"  A servant entered saying to Sir Guise "the gentleman you expected sir is come""I will attend him immediately" observed the baronet then adverting to Henry"I am really concerned to see you so much affected Mr Fitzorton I have only to regret that my paternal efforts have not answered the end proposed and as some very particular business claims me elsewhere I must bid you farewel but we shall meet yes we shall certainly meetThe abbey is still open you know and though my good offices have failed my best wishes are yours"  CHAPTER XXXVII  HENRY was now again left to his soliloquies in that house where it seemed fated for him to meet varieties of distress disappointment and despairHe found  himself more sorely beset than everhis grand discovery had been made to some of the parties who were principally concerned in itand he had the mortification to perceive his secret might have been better still confined to his own bosomAt the castle his father mother and brother James were made partakers of it letters had been sent on the subject to Johnat the abbey it had been communicated to Sir Guise and Caroline with equal ill fortuneOlivia and her father only had escaped and were the knowledge of his involvement even to extend to them it was plain to be seen that although the secret would then have taken its full range like the flight of an empoisoned arrow it would have lost nothing by its passage though the air but scatter desolation in its progress  Under this conviction Henry once again left the abbey staring wildly at Dennison who once more opened the door to him in an extreme of his miseryand in a state betwixt sense and distraction  As the reader has several times accompanied  the illstarred Henry in his gloomy walks to and from these mansions we will not now press his attendance but while Henry is on his way we shall enter that apartment in the abbey where the person who it has been noticed came to wait upon Sir Guise Stuart was conducted and whither Sir Guise was now gone to give him audience  But previously to our joining them it may be right to take a short retrospective view of the points which the worthy baronet had gained since his antipathy to the house of Fitzorton and his no less radical aversion to his daughter had arrived at their height and since for certain purposes yet in the womb of time he had assumed the mask of affection and goodwill  From the date of this memorable aera when his hate admitted not of augmentation the said mask of kindness had continued to thicken till not only the innocent victims thereof Charles Caroline Dennison Henry and the rest were deceived by itbut even the principal agent in his own  designs was enabled to penetrate the darkness of its folds  By this resolute and patient hypocrisy he had without any personal hazard the only point which his fell nature felt as a check effected in a degree what was absolutely necessary to his safety in the perpetration of some nobler works of wickedness He had by his pretended reform taken off the bitter edge of that detestation in which he was held by every creature of his own housholdHe had contrived to shift from his own shoulders the weight of whatever consequences might result from those hapless loves which his cold heart had assured him would at least he was determined to take care they should be more sickly under his chilling influence than if he any longer appeared to oppose them and his seeming to shine upon them was but like the transient gleam of the dogstar that darts upon flowers after an untimely blight had lodged the worm within their budHe knew indeed that even if Henry and his daughter should come together as one consequence of his  affected reconciliation the union itself might be made subservient to his purpose of final revenge not only in working the woe of both the husband and wife but of every individual of the two detested houses of Clare and Fitzorton and principally by the disappointment of their views in the disposal of Olivia the whole scope of which he had been made acquainted with before the partial discoveries of Caroline or Henry although we have not yet thought proper to communicate his sources of intelligence to the reader  But in fact he did not seriously believe his advance to good fellowship would produce a match between his daughter and Henry and only provided for it in his own prolific mind as a possible contingence He rather anticipated what really happened that either the folly of the lovers themselves or his own contrivance would but the more destroy their hopes the more they were made knownand  that  independent on the satisfaction which their vexation would give him for the sincere hate he bore  them he should derive from the appearance of having annihilated all his own resentments the more solid happiness he expected from entrapping the credulity of the Fitzortons  We must not omit the mention of another and that not the least important point acquired by his thus "seeming the thing he was not" viz the measure of odium he hereby took from himself in the opinion of his neighbours who heard of his great change of conduct not only from the servants who had before reprobated his behaviour but from the parties who were the objects of this extraordinary alteration  The people of the parish indeed interpreted this extraordinary change into a miracle but the good monk who was now one of the most zealous of his advocates assured them it was the simple operation of conscience which it had pleased God to awake in his heart in time not only to make atonement to all whom he had injured in this present world but effect his future salvation in the world to come  To say the truth the baronet had been at more than usual pains to observe a consistent conduct in the presence of our monastic who though a man of great simplicity and devoid of the suspicion which those who are themselves guilty cultivate most was likewise of a very penetrating mindYet the uniform diseretion of Sir Guise was more than a match for the doctor's clearness of head or purity of heartinsomuch that the best warmest and most able as well as most active defender of the baronet far and near at home and abroad was now Father Arthur  It is hence apparent that Sir Guise in a very short space of time but with a diligence suitable to so great an object might be said to have done what is justly to be considered amongst the most arduous of all human laboursto have redeemed a lost character even when indeed it was supposed to be gone  past  redemptionIt was still remembered by many how bad he had been but it was generally believed he had though late seen his errors  and that if he was now sometimes as outrageous in doing worthy as before he had been violent in committing wicked actions it should be imputed to him as an overanxious desire to make up lost time and to finish his own career of virtue by labouring doubly in the vineyard that he might work out the salvation which had been so long neglected Upon the whole therefore few persons enjoyed a fairer regenerated fame since the death of his lady as a good father a good neighbour or a sincere penitent than Sir Guise Stuart  Perhaps Sir Armine and John Fitzorton and one or two more might still have their suspicionsyet there was only one man living who at the moment here alluded to could bear witness that he was much  more  consummate in the ways of deceit than he had ever been beforeand this single living person was HIMSELF  It was even doubted by the person who now came to discourse with him and to whom we shall immediately introduce the reader  This person was no other than the notorious Mr Valentine Miles the active agent of Sir Guise upon all occasionshe collected his rents and improved his estates he got in his monies and laid them out to what he thought the best that is to say his own advantageHe was no less the parasite than the tyrant of Sir GuiseTo him the baronet was first indebted for the honour of Mrs Tempest's acquaintance and like other providers of his cast of character he was shrewdly suspected to have first tasted the dainty himself yet at other times jackall as he was he knew the art to make the lion crouch at his feet and tremble before himThe abovementioned lady numbered this gentleman amongst her first impressions although we hardly know how to call him or any other person her first love because there were about the same period so many candidates for her favour and from a peculiar philanthropy she was so little disposed to that species of cruelty whereby lovers are said so often to suffer wounds and death that it would be narrowing her kind and  relenting nature to confine her loving kindness to any individualMr Miles was certainly one of her happy menand Mr Tempest whom she honoured with her hand was another but somehow the latter soon died and the former had at least one rival lessIndeed Miles continued amongst her first favourites after the lady's heart got more into practice and even when her love of mankind increasing with the knowledge of suffering objects and her pity for their sufferings was unboundedBut then her Valentine recommended himself by more than one congenial passionthat of gamingThe love of the dice was paramount over all Indeed it nearly extinguished every other or rather it was in process of time so much the master passion that every other was in vassalage to itlove itself great enlarged and impartial as it was in the ample heart of this generous pair became subservient to itfor the lady imagined her mighty flame might be fed by once more lighting at it the torch of Hymen A dicebox in such a hand seemed to have all the magic power of that torch and  as Sir Guise Stuart raised his admiring eye to the enchantress the dice themselves were as two balls of electric fire and a thousand sparks and gentle shocks were drawn from his heart In love affairs Miles was nothing selfishHe secretly saw this conquest and interrupted it noton the contrary he had long called the object of it his bosom friend and Sir Guise became another happy man and entered into the gaming association with a spirit like that of his friend and mistress and although the aforesaid hymeneal torch had not yet lighted our baron a second time to the altar it was only consigned to Cupid as a little deity in waiting for a more convenient season  Meantime the loves and games of Valentine and Mrs Tempest went gaily onwhat though she had no nuptial torch for him she had a Cupid still very much at his service and that did full as wellAnd as to the gambling affection they might both be said to be "pleased with ruin" for they had very often been ruined together on the same evening yet retired in the most benevolent  humour on the social principle of making each other happythey had indeed often been made whole again the next morning by their  chosen  friend Sir Guise Stuart who was altogether unskilful but whom the lady by the pretences of violent love and the gentleman by those of as vehement friendship contrived to pillage of what ought to have been appropriated to his own familyfor whatever praise is due to profusion when he had money in his purse Sir Guise might claim wherever his pleasures or fears were concernedHis temper was sufficiently niggard indeed but he was coaxed or terrified out of enormous sums because in truth except by the starts of a moment which he always paid for he dared not refusehis own miserable soul was a reservoir but Miles and Mrs Tempest were the impure streams that exhausted and literally  played  it off  Yet so radical was this vice of gaming in the widow and Miles that sometimes after a run of good fortune had sent them homefor they were generally under the same roof  laden with spoils they would pass an hour before they went to bed in playing against each other and that with the same desire to cheat and win as if they were at work upon some marked novice upon whom they had a designand whichever in this t√™te√†t√™te game came off loser was to undertake the  odd trick  in other words it was the loser's part to wheedle the baronet out of the next supply  A slight specimen of the abilities of Mr Miles was exhibited to the reader in the cheat he attempted to pass upon the family of the Atwoods after he had favoured the plan for Jenny's journey to LondonBut since the discovery of his treachery he had lived wholly with the baronet's mistress as an  ami de maison  and had been the confidential medium betwixt that lady and Sir Guise in certain important points that are now to be communicated  The most material of these on the part of the lady was to make good her ground at the abbey with a view as has been intimated to her becoming no less than lady  of the manor And the death of lady Matilda gave an unexpected opening to her bold aspiring  To accomplish this however was an undertaking that called for very extraordinary powers and although those of which Mrs Tempest was in possession were certainly of this extraordinary kind they were yet insufficient to bring about so great an event without some congenial assistance  For this she applied to a man whose talents she had employed in various instances with unvarying successIndeed there was not any one amongst her acquaintanceunless she could have brought Sir Guise into a plot against himself which indeed she did in many instancesso able or for the rewards so willing as her Valentine to advance a project which he had some time suspected was going on in the mind of his beloved  Miles was blest with a head and heart so strictly in alliance with each other that like copartners they carried on business in the utmost harmonyThey had indeed  embarked in the same trade that of devising and carrying into effect all sorts of commodities which promoted the  meum  without considering the  tuum  of this life so early that they were now become from long habit and constant practice equal to any human undertaking that ever hath or may be done in rogueryAnd to complete the allusion it might be said that the best established warehouse of all kinds of knavery ready made for every possible purpose was under the firm of Mr Valentine Miles  This gentleman was of a good figure and genteel address and had indeed in his youth been a distinguished favourite of the ladiesHe was now only in the maturity of life somewhat inclined to a corpulence not strictly consistent with elegance but in perfect unison with our ideas of confirmed manhoodHe was of an assured air confident expression ready utterance versatile talents and accommodating mannersand from an uncommonly wellknit construction of limbs and great natural strength of body with a certain constitutional power  of drinking others out of their wits while he retained his own he had run his career in almost every species of debauchery without being checked by one distemper or punished by any pains of body and as to those of mind he set them gloriously at defianceHe had in short arrived at that preeminence at that perfect imperfection which annihilates the sense of fear or of shame and herein was confessedly the superior even of Sir Guise Stuart who had an abundance of the former though he possessed not a jot of the latter  Upon all these grounds he was the fittest for a connection with the baronet of any man in the world for as there was not an infamous thought which the heart of man could conceive but was engendered by Sir Guise so was there not any man who had so much intrepidity of practical baseness to carry such conception into action as Miles  This accomplished gentleman therefore and Mrs Tempest divided the baronet between them and had been for some time contriving how to dispose in a more legal  manner of his family and fortune to their wishes for as the widow had after sounding him avowed her design to Miles of becoming lady Stuartso had Miles in return of confidence then first mentioned a longcherished intention of making proposals to the baronet for getting rid of the incumbrance of his daughter Caroline  Now his was a kind of underplot to be woven into their domestic plan in order to strengthen their interestsThis little episode indeed rather endeared the expected catastrophe to Mr Miles who at the fall of the curtain promised himself from this double marriage which might indeed be called the title of the farce  more  than double advantagewhile Mrs Tempest was reconciled to it on principles of equal convenience and accommodation differing only a little in the idea as to CarolineShe did not love Miles well enough to feel any jealousy about the division of his personal favours but she indulged the secret thought that she should come in not only for an equal division of Caroline's fortuneMiles  having promised her a moiety in case the match should be brought aboutbut for the sole and sovereign authority over the estates of Sir Guise Stuart meditating indeed to hold these so much at controul that neither her Sir Guise nor her Valentine should have a greater proportion than their good behaviour to her seemed to merit from her bountyAs to the baronet's person her discovery of his infidelity with Jane Atwood was the finishing stroke to the remains of what she was pleased to call loveshe held it more cheap than that of Miles but not being over nice in her sensations she foresaw the possibility of still retaining both in the voluminous list of her happy men  In regard to the nature of Valentine's attachment to Caroline it as little partook of the troublesome and avaricious tenderness which confines the great passion of love to one person as that which Mrs Tempest bore either to her intended husband or to her old protector for though Mrs Tempest was a woman of some violence in all respects she professed sovereign scorn of  those who affected to argue against pluralities in the  belle passion  and though she declared she doated on Miles to distraction it was thought various others were her doating pieces also and a domestic of her father's had distracted her in the same manner so effectually some months before that the outward and visible signs of it were obvious even when her elopement from her family was determined on and the arms of the accommodating Valentine were open to receive her with all incumbrances It was a longbalanced point on her part whether she should stay with Mr Thomas the footman or run away with Mr Valentine Miles her papa's engrossing clerk for at that time her father was an attorney and Miles was his assistant A compromise however took place between all parties Mr Thomas had a parting  douceur  and a promise of future provision and Mr Miles agreed to the arrangement in all its parts and so carried off the lady but whether they did or did not provide for  Mr Thomas cannot at this moment be made known  Miles had often seen Miss Stuart both in her mother's lifetime and since her death but had never intimated his passion otherwise than by certain sighs and smiles moral sentences and wellturned compliments from time to time which partly his subordinate situation in life as her father's agent and partly her own preoccupied sentiments had prevented Caroline from seeing in the least degree the drift of He intended indeed at first only to seduce her but he now entertained honourable sentiments as the most profitable In regard to the former objection to him Miles considered it on reflection now done away by his profession as he always maintained before those who were disposed to question his titles that a gambler was  a gentleman  seeing it mixed him constantly in the very best company and if ever the baronet disputed the claim Miles would rise up in great displeasure use some terrifying menace and insist either on receiving  a suitable apology or the satisfaction due to a  gentleman  Of late indeed some pretty smart contests about division of spoil had past between Miles and the widow their affection for each other was almost worn out and yet their ties of interest were so strong that fear operated now as love had done before to keep them together for each well knew a very little treachery on either sideas is the case with most rogues who confederatewould destroy both  Believing that the reader is by this time as perfectly acquainted with these great personages as it is necessary for him to be to the right understanding the events which chain our historywe shall proceed to unfold the business which brought Mr Miles to the abbey But as what past between the worthy agent and his illustrious employer will be in part best given in dialogue we shall as being indeed fit company only for each other give them a chapter to themselves  CHAPTER XXXVIII  MILES  WHAT am I to believe my dear friend Is it true that you have offered your daughter in marriage to the son of your direst foe Is it fear or is it madness that induced you to this step Whatever was the motive it was carrying the point too far it was passing my prescribed line of policy and giving an advantage which  SIR GUISE  with conscious pride  Ha ha ha and have I deceived the deceptive Valentine Miles Then is my art triumphant indeed  MILES  Not so triumphant as you may suppose sir You are the dupe of your own artifice and if especial care be not taken you will yourself fall into the trap you have set for others  SIR GUISE  I understand you not  MILES  Our trusty emissary brings certain intelligence that your enemies at the castle with the tremendous John at their head design to take advantage of this your pacific disposition and breaking the truce when you least suspect it cut you off at once  SIR GUISE  in consternation  Cut me off murderous villains  MILES  But we are I hope yet in time to circumvent them  SIR GUISE  in terror  You hope Is there still a doubt then Let us take our measures this moment What are they What could induce the assassins to this at a moment too when I supposed the credulous fools  MILES  That is the misfortune of it While we are attempting to succeed in our design upon others we are apt to forget they may be as wise as ourselves and have their plans upon  us  Thus it is with the Fitzortons and StuartsIt would be distraction to suppose the former  towards whom it has been the business of years to shew every mark of obloquy you  dare  safely hazard should ever believe your sudden overtures to good fellowship sincere or be so blind to the human passions as to accept them if they werethe lovesick boys alone excepted This cobweb artifice may pass on children and lovers who are more weak than childrenit may serve perhaps to amuse the hearts of your daughter and Henry Fitzortonit may hoodwink your neighboursand so much I expected from the measurebut you and I who know the world ought to throw out of our experienced minds such infantile and such frivolous credulities The practised and politic Sir Guise ought to know that his proffered hand was received with precisely the same degree of sincerity with which it was tendered To have rejected it would have been as unwise in old Fitzorton as in Sir Guise not to have presented it But this doneboth parties judging naturally should put themselves in preparation for war the very instant peace was talked of  Ask your own heart my friend whether its hate has diminished or its hope of revenge has ceased since you extended the hand of fictitious amity and held out the olivebranch  SIR GUISE  O Miles my heart rankles with more deadly poisons and my pretended treaty of friendship was as you know but the more securely to give that blow which your sublimer genius and wisdom told me would be most effectually struck when my hated foes were off their guard My seeming to smile upon them was but as the gleam of the Dogstar darting upon flowers after the blight has lodged a worm within the bud  MILES  True our only apprehension issince those foes are alike diligentlest they should have the start of us The tender Mrs Tempest has dispatched me on the wing of affection to communicate the information I have given you that your speedy  assassination  is intended since nothing short of your death can pacify Sir Armine Fitzorton or  his inveterate son John these are their words for the insult sustained the sense of which notwithstanding a pretended patched up reconciliation has been brooding in their minds ever since They have their plots as wily and as wellconcerted as our own  SIR GUISE  ready to expire with fear  Bloodyminded villains Haste my friend to prevent them I may this night be murdered in my bed and who knows but Henry and Caroline or even Charles may be concerned in the plot It is always the wisest way to suspect every body Ungrateful wretches while I have been thus generously sacrificing to themat least such it must have appeared to them  MILES  Sir Guise I need not at this time of day enter into professions of attachment to you My friendship towards you is as unquestionable as Mrs Tempest's love We would both live or die for you You have had proof of it and if you should which heaven forbid fall a victim to the secret and  deeplaid machinations of your enemiesif you should be destined to breathe your last  SIR GUISE  inconceivably agitated  Talk not of breathing my last but hasten to prevent it Save my life and gratify me with complete vengeance on the execrable villains who are now plotting my destruction and there is nothing within the purchase of my fortune that shall not be yours in reward of the deed  MILES  The intention at the castle I understand to be thisJenny Atwood who is there protected as an instrument against you is to be an evidence of your disgrace which is to be of the most public kind Your cowardice your falsehood thus they vilify you your receiving a blow your abuse of your late lady your avarice to your son your cruelty to your daughter your seduction of Jane your criminal intercourse with Mrs Tempest this is their  vile  language your oppression of your neighbours and your assumed change of character and conduct which they pretend to see throughall  these are forming into one mass first to effect your disgrace  SIR GUISE  gloriously disregarding mere loss of character  But my lifemy LIFE Valentine  MILES  First to effect your disgrace I say and thenbut indeed their purpose is too horribleI know not how to divulge it  Having wrought the baronet to this the proper pitch of curiosity expectation and terror Mr Miles pausedwhen seeing Sir Guise in a disposition to believe every thing and to dread what he believed he exclaimed "But there is some satisfaction in the thought that unless we all become victims at the same time you shall not my dear friendno you shall not die unrevenged"  Sir Guise answered "I tell you I will not dieI will sooner leave the abbeyI will sooner fly from the hated face of manof you and Tempest and all the world"  "Fly from me and Tempest you cannot shall not" cries Miles "for  her  love and  my  friendship shall follow you to the uttermost ends of the earthAh my good friend were we all united by ties as sacred as they are strong were we all of one family and our fates and fortunes run together what could hurt us I should defy the powers of hell confederated then to molest you but while we are thus divided"  "I see your wishes" answered the baronet"your longdesired happiness shall be grantedI here pledge myself that  my  hand shall be Tempest's and my  daughter's  yoursif you will in this instance rescue me from the designs of the accursed Fitzortons and effect my revenge upon them without hazard to my person  "It is enough" said Miles "I know you are a man of honour and the instant I have informed Mrs Tempest of her happinessyou know how it will rejoice her tender soul which doats on youthose measures shall be takenindeed I had concerted them previously without other inducement than pure disinterested friendshipwhich will complete your triumph and the defeat of  your enemies at one and the same instant Meantime as our double marriage cannot you know take place immediately it might be wrong to let the idea go abroad to any part of your own family till the impending danger to your precious life is over and then my dear fatherfor I may now call you by that tender namewe may shape the intelligence according to events Indeed I am ambitious to deserve the honour of an alliance with Sir Guise Stuart by saving his life  before  I receive the bright reward the promise of which should I even die myself in preserving you I shall think a full atonement for though I have not like that puny lover the sensitive Henry Fitzorton been playing at the game of declaration I have an affection whichan affection whichbut your dear life my future parent is in dangerand this is no time to talk sentimentally about my passionso if you will consider of these little articles of family affection which I have drawn up supposing the family convention between us to take placeand just put your name thereto I will  clap the saddle on my horse to convey the glad tidings to Mrs Tempestand return with such plans and powers of putting them into execution as shall rid you of all your fears Meantime you will intimate nothing of what has past to your family but wait my return in assured expectation that my life shall be the guarantee of yoursAlas Sir Guise" continued Miles taking the baronet by the hand "what would have been the event had not my incessant vigilance and secret intelligence traced the hellish plot now forming against you at the castle I am sorry to say Henry is almost the ringleader your own son is not without a hand in the conspiracy and in less than eightandforty hours your deathyour concerted murder"  "Eightandforty hours Mercy defend me"cries the baronet  "Your death I say within that time would have been as certain as will now be your preservation"  At the end of this sentence Sir Guise leaped on the neck of Miles with the most  extravagant demonstrations of joycalled him and Tempest his only friends protectors and preserversswore they only should be his future heirs his present asocociatesdeclared he longed for the hour which should give to one the claims of a wife and to the other those of a sonand protested he only waited till the forms of mourning for Lady Stuart were past personally to make a graceful offer He then opened the paper which Miles had given glanced his eye hastily over the contents which he approvedcaught up a pen and signed his namecalled in Dennison and another domestic as witnesses telling them it was a mere deed of trustdismissed them the instant they had made their signatures and thus bound himself to obligations the nature of which he scarcely knew being under terrors which would have induced him to sign away the globeand again hugging Miles to his bosom and calling him his best friend urged him not to spare horseflesh to greet Tempest with the most lavish epithets of fondness and to return with the utmost speed adding  as Miles departed that he should not dare to take food or rest till he again embraced his dear Valentineso the dastard now called a man whom he had long feared and despised and such was the message he sent by that man to a woman who was both his aversion and his dread  Miles had not left the room more than a minute when he reentered saying as upon recollection that in his zeal to accomplish the baronet's safety he had forgot all other matters especially to intimate that as the design of counterplotting the Fitzortons would be attended with considerable expence  "I understand you" said Sir Guise taking out some banker's checks and scribbling at random "You will pass the house get these cashed and should more be wanted I have always some running cash with my country banker"  "We are wasting time" said Miles pocketing the drafts "God bless you Expect me soon Be silent and be safe"  CHAPTER XXXIX  BUT great as were the motives already assigned for this invention of plots and intended counterplots to work upon the fears of Sir Guisethe inventor and his fair associate Mrs Tempest were influenced by other inducements more potent than all the advantages they had hopes of deriving in the issue from the operation of those fears and the wellconnected fable on which they were founded  The primary wheels in this grand machine were the lust of revenge and a lust yet more fordid more violent which the widow and her Valentine bore towards the Clares and Fitzortons  Mr Clare had been the first to intimate to his friend Fitzorton that there was something more wicked though better disguised in the disposition of Miles than that of the baronetadding that he had heard a story of his being drummed out of a regiment  somewhere in Ireland for malpractices amongst which "it hangs in my memory" said Mr Clare"that theft and perjury were not the most atrocious"  This happening to be communicated to Sir Armine in the presence of one David Otley a domestic of Mr Clare's and a shrewd fellow but to whom Mr Clare was somewhat attached the caution reached by this medium the ear of Mr Miles John Fitzorton had been at some pains to trace this rumour not only in compliance with Mr Clare's suspicions but in confirmation of his own which had secretly fastened upon this man even when he had the privileges of a visitor at the castle in common with Sir Guise who introduced himJohn soon profited of those opportunities which his military connexions gave him and made a report at the castle not covertly but consistent with the intrepid decision of his character  One day when the same David Otley was waiting at the back of his master's chair and when indeed Sir Guise himselfit  being prior to the public breachwas at Sir Armine's table"It is matter of astonishment to me" said John who happened to be the only person of his family then present "that a fellow who has every vice in human nature but cowardiceand that single exception proceeding only from a fearless constitutional impudenceshould gain the protection of any person of credit"  Then turning to Sir Guise he added "If on your return to the abbey you should meet with a friend of yours who answers to this character do me the honour sir to tell him what I have said And farther should his being in possession of the single quality I have alluded to namely his insolent courage be thought a counterbalance for the stain of every baseness by the use and exercise  you  may have for it Sir Guise I have only to desire in the name of my family that the gentleman who may be so gifted from this moment for evermore may forbear coming to the castleand I think I may venture to add or the manorhouse"  It is unnecessary to observe that this pointed message was carried at the time to the party concernedIndeed lest any thing should be lost in its journey from the castle to the abbey it was kindly taken to the latter mansion by two personsSir Guise faithfully related it the very same night to Mr Valentine Miles and David Otley took it in his budget of castle and manorhouse intelligence the next morning  A natural consequence arising from this inhibition was of course cutting the acquaintance of Mr Miles but another very natural consequence of course  also  took place between the truly brave John Fitzorton and the truly audacious Valentine Miles  No sooner was the latter in possession of the favourable sentiments borne him by the former than he sent in turn a scarce less civil message to John who instantly observed the contents without so much as uttering a syllable to any of the family save and except to True George then  his  domestic Miles had contrived to get the baronet to  accompany him to the place of rendezvous without letting him know the designAccordingly the parties met at the dawn of the third day from the communication of John's opinionAt the sight of John whose very countenance was a rebuke to cowardice Sir Guise involuntarily drew back a few paces and the view of the pistols a brace of which both antagonists took out of their pockets at the same time made him so expert at the science of tergiversation that he had got several yards in his way home exclaiming "Miles had betrayed him"before the said Miles perceived he had taken frightValentine however who wanted him as a witness of that prowess which might be one day of service in his own cause soon brought him back asserting that "  He  was in no danger"and the duellists prepared for action  John condescended only to say sternly "Fellow I am admitting you to an undeserved honour"Then settling their distance and taking aim almost in the same  instant John discharged his shot and received that of Miles without any injury to eitherJohn's ball however whizzed so near to the body of Sir Guise who had shifted about that the good baronet again took to his heels and George after him leaving the field of battle solely to the combatantsJohn's next ball took effect in the neck of his adversary who dropping on the ground John demanded "if he was satisfied with his being still of opinion he was a scoundrel" and upon being answered by Valentine that "he was satisfied for the present" John left him to the care of True George who by this time returned without the fearful game of which he had been in chaseJohn now walked home saying to True George "When you have conveyed that fellow to the abbey return to me at the castle and do not inform any of my family I have disgraced either them or myself by such a contest I charge youAnd as for you sir" added he addressing Miles as George lifted him from the ground"if you live and are again as impudent as you are infamous  I may be tempted to confer on you the dignity of a second leaden token of my esteem for your virtues and if you die public honours ought to be adjudged me for being the author of that inestimable blessing to the community your invaluable death"  Although neither John who was too much ashamed of his exploit nor True George who was too faithful to his trust revealed this transaction to any other person at home or abroadand perhaps both had long since thrown it from their memories as unworthy of preservationthe whole business was still smarting in the recollection of Miles whoalthough he did not think proper to call John to a second account nor to assign it amongst his motives for taking part in the vengeance of Sir Guisehad been inwardly consuming with the most implacable hatred to the whole family ever since  He had indeed long watched his occasionhad assiduously though secretly fomented every cause and effect of hatred in the baronetand was almost in despair of  an opportunity falling out suitable to his design when at length he came to the knowledge of circumstances which will presently be no secret to the reader and which if well managed he did not doubt would produce a rich harvest of events favourable to his love his avarice and his vengeanceThe fabrication of the welltimed story of the assassination of Sir Guise was simply a necessary prelude to the bringing this about and as to the degree of probability of the tale he was the less careful to construct it as he had often perceived that when the baronet's terrors were once excited by a sudden shock none of his faculties were sufficiently at his command to reflect how the history hung together or how the parts were in harmony with the wholeOn the contrary every sense seemed to take the alarm at the moment he heard of a possible danger and like an affrighted family running from a house at the cry of fire every passion of his soul but that of fear left his bosom  Now in accounting for the hatred  which the widow Tempest bore to the house of Fitzorton we fear we must be under the disagreeable necessity of telling yet another Family Secret and one which a more prudent biographer would conceal But the truth that guides our pen demands the discovery and the human nature to which our history is dedicated must plead excuse for whatever offences the developement of mysteries behind her curtain may bring to light  CHAPTER XL  HENRY became acquainted with Mrs Tempest without knowing any thing of her attachment to Valentine Miles or her connexion with Sir Guise StuartThe time was critical  It was during Henry's visit in London to a female relation and his first interview happened at a very remarkable moment It was in truth in the evening of the day on which with his accustomed punctuality and  ardour he had dispatched a large pacquet of "everlasting love and constancy" to his dear Caroline under cover to the trusty Dennison  The soft duty of his heart discharged he went to the theatre full of the tenderest vows the fondest ideas but having made in company with some young friends larger libations to the purple god of the grape or rather to the health of his beloved than his reason could bear though his passion seemed to augment at every glasshe happened to walk we had almost written  stagger  into a box where the widow was then smiling at Mr Congreve's pleasant comedy of Love for Love Seeing a place to the left vacant and near a beautiful lady the right side being occupied by another female who appeared to be in the character of a foil rather than of a rival brilliant he made one of those bows which were sure to procure him a gracious reception and perceiving his welcome insured by the brilliant's sitting closer to the foil in  order to make more room for himhe took possession of the seat  Rather as an effect of high youth and high spirits animated by love and wine than a spirit of gallantry he entered at once into some glowing remarks on the scene which was then representingThe lady being one of those females who follow first impressions and have the talent of being desperately in love at a glance contrived to forget in the space of half an hour that Sir Guise Stuart for it was his widow Tempest had any claims for money or her Valentine Miles for loveor indeed that Mr Congreve had any wit or that her muse companion required any more of her attention than if she had been part of the bench she sat onor in short that there was any body but the enchanting young stranger at her side in the creationShe presently gave the youth such manifest and manifold proofs of her so thinking by certain little tendernesses innuendoes languishing looks and gentle pressures every one  of whichthough they were perfectly new to himbeing altogether in a different style from the attentions of the chaste and charming Carolineit was impossible for him not to comprehend their meaning and before the couples in the  comedy  were brought tegether in the last act an union of a different kind was settled in the lady's mind and ratified in her eyes which seemed to  insist  on the consent of the young gentleman In a word the widow thought her new objectand indeed she decided rightly one of the handsomest and most elegant young men she had ever seenand agreeably to  her  firstsight system was by the time the first act of the farce was over  in love with him to distraction  It is probable she heard not a sentence of act the second though it was upon a subject congenial to her feelings so entirely was she engrossed by her new conqueror At the conclusion common gallantry required he should see her safe out of the house and put her and her still dumb companion into their carriageto which as he was handing  them the widow said even as she set her foot on the step "I hope sir I shall have the honour to set you down in return for your civility"Which offer being accompanied by certain invisible signs and tokens as potent as the secrets of freemasonry or the ancient art of palmistry Henry got into the coach and seated himself on the same side without attending to the other lady quite so much as the forms of politeness might seem to prescribe  Henry new to the town thought it right in point of etiquette to see the lady home before he took the liberty of using her carriage which was therefore driven to a very handsome house in Grosvenor Square where alighting to hand the ladies out it is certainly  possible  that Henry might have taken leave of his ladies had not the sprightly widow sportingly exclaimed with certain accompaniments having still hold of his arm "We may as well make it the romance of a night sir if you are not better engagedfor you must know I dreamed of an adventure of this sort and  am just in the humour to have my dream outWhat say you Priscilla"turning to her companion"I should like it of all things" replied the ladyHenry was not in a disposition to be rude so the widow informed the coachman she should have no farther occasion for the carriage and the  trio  of choice spirits tripped into the house  Voluptuous elegance now began its fascinationA collation was soon served up after which the servants disappeared the most costly wines circulated for neither the widow nor her companion was unknown to the jolly god and either of them would have taken off her bottle with more ease than Olivia Clare or Caroline Stuart or any such "puny whipster" of the sex could have managed her first and half sipped her second glass  Indeed our fair seducers were frequent votaries at the court of Comus insomuch that Mrs Tempest might have represented and in truth often  did  represent upon the stage of life the part of Euphrosyne and  her associate had as often done equal justice to the character of the principal bacchante  It is with reluctance we tell the reader that Henry was not so much alarmed at finding himself in such company as was Milton's lady when she discovered the danger of  her  situationyet the situation was but too similar with respect to the surrounding magic  Mrs Tempest was in all senses of the character a syrenHer voice though neither sweet nor tender either like that of Olivia or Caroline was yet seductively harmoniousHer eyes though possessing neither the modest lustre of Olivia's nor the appealing softness of Caroline's darted such intolerable fire through her long dark eyelashes that a less ardent gazer than Henry might have been scorched by their burning beamsShe was somewhat under the size of Olivia and by the same proportion above that of Carolineshe wanted the chaste dignity that gave command to the one and was utterly destitute of the interesting  graces shifting with every attitude that adorned the otherBut she had to boast a symmetry of shape a certain voluptuous roundness of limbs a  contour  of visage and an alluring government of countenance so entirely the reverse of both that while  their  features were formed to  instruct  the beholder that real beauty love and virtue were the samethose of the widow were calculated to excite suddenly a train of impetuous emotions formed to seduce from the youthful bosom all its heavenly guards and lure the gazer to indulge in the fatal contrastAll the lineaments of her face offered the most infallible marks of passion unrestrained an inordinate love of pleasure and a total disdain of the decent laws by which passion and pleasure and more especially in women ought to be regulatedHer lips were in exact correspondence with her eyes and as constantly employed in expressing the same emotions and the regularity and colour of her teeth could only yield to the beauty of her arms and bosom which were in the highest perfection  of female loveliness but were displayed or shaded with a studied attention that denoted she was at once proud and conscious of their attraction  The then extreme youth of Henry the novelty of the situation the combining enchantments and the state of the poor lad's head will we hope mitigate his offence should we own as own we must that he was far from being a mere neutral listener or looker on during the hilarities of the eveningHe looked at the widow indeed with a timid admiration and as she sung several couplets from the  l' Allegro  Henry's manly and pathetic voice which the reader has already heard celebrated joined in the chorus with a spirit that shewed he had been gradually enchanted  out of himself  "Here's a health to those that we love" cries the widow filling the glass while she sung  "Here's a health to those that love  us  ' answered her companion in the same style putting the bottle which contained some excellent champaigne to Henry who then  for the first time probably since the intoxication began blushed and sighed as at the remembrance of Caroline  This however though noticed by the piercing eyes of the widow was construed rather into growing passion for herself than tenderness for anotherWith renewed fervency therefore she proceeded with the song increasing in animation as she went onand when they came to the following line which the widow trilled with uncommon melody  O my love lov'st thou me  she cast an enflaming and decided look at Henry and her redundant hair dropt from its slight bondage and covered her with its luxurious mantle  The heart of Henry must have been made of "impenetrable stuff" indeed had he at such a time in such a place and at such an opportunity affected not to understand the drift of such a question breathed in harmony through the lips of beauty  The companion on some pretence or  other withdrew and the very few remains of modesty which had been reluctantly confined in the room before followed her or rather flew blushingly out of the apartment the moment the door opened and seemed to wish for an asylum in Caroline's or Olivia's bosom  Mrs Tempest and Henry were now together and very few moments more might have completed the triumph of youthful folly and infidelity had not Henry's good angel in the  imaged  form of Caroline herself interposedand that pure image was brought forward even by Mrs Tempest herself  "Come one more brimmer to the woman of your heart" said Mrs Tempest replenishing her own and then Henry's glass "This one bumper more thou enchanting stranger whowithout my knowledge of or desire to know thy name family fortune or aught but thy enchanting  self  hast turned a moment of time into an age of love"  She quoted theatrically various rhapsodies  from the old dramatic poets and then seizing Henry's hand every artery of which trembled she pressed it to her lips exclaiming "Ah dear unknown tell me who she isWhat is her nameWhose health am I to drinkWho is my too happy rivalFor to supposeto flatter myself I have the bliss to find the heart of such a loveinspiring fellow unengagedand still at liberty to devote itself to this throbbing breast"  She thought proper to hesitate and imitate bashful difficultythen went on  "To dare even hope that I meet such a treasure undisposed of is a bliss too great too mightyNo 'twas too presumptuous and yet to think this hand those lips that form this panting heart another'sO it would destroy meBy my soul it would"  After a trembling pause she cried "You are silentyou blushyour lips turn pale and good heavensah what do I see there are tears in your eyesAccursed fortuneperhaps perhaps you love  confusion perhapsno you are notsurely you are not  married  but if you are"  "Curse as the sweet poet sayscurse on  all  laws but those which love has made"  Love free as air at sight of human  ties  Spreads its light wing and in a moment flies  CHAPTER XLI  HAVING finished her poetical justifications which have been many a pretty libertine's and tripping lady's apology she observed Henry extremely troubled  "What can be the matter with you Yes I know my fateIt is not the fetters of wedlock  only  I have to contend with these might be brokenthese I could snap asunderbut you are bound in the chains of  love  almighty loveand Iwretched womanBut I am resolved to know all  Here since you cannot speak the cruel word writewrite the dreaded namewrite on the back of this letter and with my pencil therewho am I to hatecurseexterminatemark the detested name"  "  Detested  name" reiterated Henry "oh she is an angel and her precious name would be profaned were I to breathe it now with these unfaithful lips to those polluted ones which have tempted me to injure her"  "  Polluted  lips" in her turn reechoed the widow springing up and disdainfully withdrawing her hand from Henry's "  Polluted lips  have a care siryou do not perhaps know that as I can doat to distraction so can I abhor to madness yes and both with equal speed  Polluted lips  they have seldom been rewarded for their partiality by such an epithet"  She took the room three or four times backwards and forwards in a violent passion sometimes throwing herself down into a chair sometimes tossing by Henry without  deigning to mark her rage except through the flashes of her indignant eyesfrom which shot now as intense flames of fury as had a few moments before darted burning beams of desireHer whole person was rendered terrifying and might perhaps have alarmed Henry though by no means apt to be appalled had not another object more fraught with terrors than an hundred thousand angry men or even women with an equal number of armed troops in their train fastened upon his attention namely the sight of the  address  of that letter which the widow had produced for the purpose of his penciling her rival's name and which the said widow had hurled in disdain upon the sofa where Henry and she had before been seated  This superscription opened on Henry's eyes the following discoveriesfirst that he had entangled himself almost past redemption in an affair of gallantry with the mistress of his beloved Caroline's father and secondly that it was directed to the said  father's mistress in the wellknown handwriting of Sir Guise Stuart  "Merciful Heaven" exclaimed Henry "what do I seeis it possible madam you should be Mrs Tempest"  "And what  then  sir" demanded the widow snatching the letter from Henry and throwing it into the fire with a dreadful execration  "  That  Mrs Tempest continued Henry of whom I have heard so muchwhom Sir Guise Stu"  "And who then are  you  " questioned the widow stopping him in the middle of the name"Are you that enemy of mine his detested son whose hate I have long felt but whose person I have never yet"  "No Madam" replied Henry interrupting in his turn"I am not so great so just so honourable a man as that noble that distinguished youth whom I now blush to call my friendbut unworthy as I am I bless heaven for this timely discovery this miraculous escape"  Henry caught up his hat and without  considering the lateness of the hour or any thing else but what he had mentioned hurried to the door  "Escapeescapeinsolentimpudent" raved forth Mrs Tempest running after him and pulling him back"Confusion to my soulif you provoke me whosoever you are were you the father who gave me life"  Henry struggled in her graspand a violent rapping at the street door made him step a few paces back  The lady exclaimed still keeping her hold and perfectly agonized with rage shaking Henry while she spoke"God be thankedthat is either Valentine or Sir Guisenow sir will  my triumph  be complete"  As she said this a noise was heard upon the stairs and presently the former of the abovementioned persons made his appear+ance  He had come to town as the reader may remember post haste on the business of Jane Atwood Arriving with Sir Guise in the  middle of the night and having left the baronet in Jane's lodgings which had been provided by Mileshe Miles had made up his excuse for visiting the widow at so unseasonable an hour as at that time he observed some etiquette with her  At the sight of Henry whom he had seen more than once at the abbey and whose passion for Caroline he had heard from Sir Guise he started as at that of an apparition  "Mr Henry Fitzorton" exclaimed he  "WhoHenry Fitzorton" cried the widow"No wonder then these unheardof outrages have been heaped on meand I have not the smallest doubt but that one wickedness would have led to another till it had ended in my deathoh Valentine sure heaven sent you at this moment to my rescuecould you conceive what I have endured from this till now unknown wretchyour heart would bleed for me"  She then related the foregore scene so as exactly to reverse the several actual circumstances  observing with an admirable accuracy of transposition that "he had rudely seated himself in the same box at the playhousewatched her outthrust himself into her coachran up stairs as soon as they got homeforced poor Priscilla her companion out of the roomlocked the doorswore that he would destroy the first person who offered to approachand on casting his eye upon a letter she had received from her dear dear Sir Guise whose handwriting he knew he slandered both him and Valentine with a volley of execrationsand was proceeding to every thing shocking when her good stars brought her friend Valentine to her aid'Twas surely providence" c c c  As soon as she had finished this speech which the gentleman whom she addressed believed as much of as she did herselfyet the former thought it might be most productive to give it creditValentine went into another room observing "he should return in a moment"  The widow then sallied up to Henry and  in a malicious whisper accompanied by a sarcastic sneer her arms akimbo demanded "whether he thought another miracle would happen to befriend his  escape  from the vengeance of her injured friend"  Henry disdained to make her any reply and indeed before he could have done so Miles returned with his pistols at the sight of which Mrs Tempest affecting to be alarmed flung herself on her knees and interceded for the life of Henrythen by a gentle whisper suggested to Miles "that if the outrage were well managed it would be worth more to them both than a million of such lives"This intercession wrought so on the tender heart of Miles that all would have gone off for the moment with a gentle reprimand or menace had not Henrywho felt the Fitzorton blood rush in boiling torrents through his veins walked towards Valentine and snapping his fingers in his face observed loftily "that the trick was too stale and that as he was too infamous a wretch to be met on a level by a man of honour whose family had justly  banished him from their presence he should be warranted to treat him in the only way such a scoundrel was entitled to if he did not let him pass out of the  private brothel  which Sir Guise and himself kept between them"I have concealed your vile secret which has been long communicated to me by the injured Charles only out of delicacy to my angelI will no more sully her pure name by breathing it in a pest houseBut if an accent respecting the shameful company into which I have been trepanned by that vicious and artful woman is mentioned either in my hearing or in that of any person dear to me and it should reach me I will set fire to a train that shall destroy you bothso be warned"  It was with great difficulty Miles now held the arms of Mrs Tempest who maddened with rage shame and disappointment Miles was himself scarce less inflamed but certain ideas rose in his mind suddenly that induced him to let Henry go unmolested out of the room and also to hold the widow by main force till the street door  was shut even to the hazard of Valentine's own face which received several lusty blowsbut when Henry was fairly off it did not take either much pains or time to convince the lady that "though her whole story was  well put together  he knew it had not one syllable of truth in it and that even had it been as veritable as it was false it would be better for all parties to hush up the affair at presentTill we provoke the stripling farther he will keep  our  secret for the sake of  his own  and the bringing upon us the fury of Charles and of the d *** d Fitzortonsand in consequence of our illtimed resentment arousing that nest of hornets the magistrateswould ruin the fruit of those plans which a little discretion will matureAnd as to Sir Guise himself" added Miles archly"it would be as impossible to persuade him as me or indeed yourself that a young fellow should come here and drink champaigne or burgundywhich I perceive by these telltale bottles has been the casewithout your consent unless he committed a rape upon  the key of your cellar alsoNono let us be merry and wise my dear widow leave the event of this business with meI have a memory and mind very faithful to my resentments and depend upon it when opportunity favours though it should be the length of the siege of Troy before it arrives I shall cherish the freshest recollection of whatever has been done or said in this business even down to the saucy snap of his fingers in my face which  his heart's dearest blood  shall one day pay forno matterleave the  thoughts  of revenge to meWhen time is ripe do you assist the deed and depend on it we shall both be satisfied"  This consideration pacified her and as Miles knew Sir Guise was safely disposed of in the apartments of the deluded Jane Atwood for the night he entered into the explanations he thought fit to make the widow for his untimely visit and the amiable pair retired after the bustles of the night to the consolation of each other's faithful arms  But though this happy couple reconciled by mutual deception were satisfied with each other they were by no means so with Henryfor notwithstanding the happy turn which the widow gave to the affair at the time and her incessant assurances since so often as it was mentioned it was beyond the reach of policy casuistry or the most solemn oaths to make Valentine believe there had not been some previous intercourse between Henry and herself and that he caught them only in some quarrel of love which would have ended in the usual way had not his coming at the moment made it expedient for her to  pretend  violence outrage and displeasureAnd the idea did not a little aggravate the hate he bore to the Fitzortons who appeared at every turn the bane of his purposesIndeed John and Henry were now alike detestable to him especially as at this time the person of Mrs Tempest though for reasons good he consented to divide her with Sir Guisewas not then indifferent to him for he had only begun  to plot alienating the affections of the recently seduced Jane from the baronet  And as to Mrs Tempest herself the sudden gust of loveor by whatever other name the reader thinks it ought to be called for Henry was presently succeeded by as sudden an aversion when she found that no less than three penitently  tender  letters and one madly  accusing  epistle which she caused to be clandestinely delivered to him by the means of David Otley produced  not one word of reply  The caution and dread of consequences however suggested by Miles restrained her from public and avowed revenge but the thirst of vengeance kept raging within and threatened one day to burst upon his head Meantime she availed herself of more than one occasion to do him secret mischief by way of giving earnest of her future designs The anonymous letters to John and his father respecting Caroline were from this lady's penand had she known at the time his situation with Olivia that would probably have been the subject of a third  epistleWhy she did not since that do him this kindness also is yet in our confidence and also the farther proof in her instance how great truth there is in that celebrated distich of the poet  Heav'n has no plague like love to hatred turn'd  Nor Hell a fury like a woman scorn'd  In regard to Henry candid reader his error and his repentance are both before youHis trespass and his temptations have been delineated  We are writing certain parts of the history of Human Nature the inconsistencies of which we must again repeat it is our office rather to describe than account for The foregoing scene has nothing irreconcilable with the frail though interesting subject of our book the human heart and it is to be wished that every young man who  began  an adventure of this kind as imprudently might  finish  it as amiably as Henry Fitzorton  To suppose that this his approach to infidelity will recommend him to the virtuous  reader would be insulting but to imagine he has lost that virtuous reader's good will for his first and last indiscretion of this kind would be to suspect that the reader has either great ignorance of human nature or great hypocrisythere seems to us no other alternativeLeaving therefore the point to be settled by the only power which can settle it the reader's  conscience  we shall return to the place from whence we have digressed  CHAPTER XLII  ABOUT the time that the disastrous Henry left the abbey the impatient Olivia bent her steps toward that venerable mansionand never perhaps was an evening walk undertaken by two persons in situations of mind and with reflections more opposite Henry impelled by despair and driven by irremediable necessity from the presence of his dear but deeply distressed Caroline literally felt that "he dragged at each remove  the lengthening chain" every step hurried him farther from the object of his affections while Olivia animated by hope was by every step brought nearer to him whom she loved with unspeakable tenderness and whom she fondly believed she was about to make the happiest of mankind  They met about the mid way of the memorable grand avenue and the sudden sight of each other inspired very distinct emotionsHenry wished for the velocity of thought to escape so unseasonable a rencontre and Olivia sighed for the speed of light to reach his handYet both were alike embarrassed the one by trembling joy the other by variety of sorrowBy an involuntary impulse Henry receded a few paces with the degree of rapidity that Olivia advanced the wings of fear are even more rapid than those of loveBut Henry soon recovered himself and his steps and by one of those hazards which have all the air of design and yet are common enough in life Olivia and Henry joined each other immediately parallel to the place where the first  avowal of love had been made by Henry to Carolinea circumstance we trust in the full recollection of the reader  Anxious to know Caroline's reply to the request stated in the letter which had already produced so much mischief in the abbey family Olivia was covered with blushes and hesitating almost to a stammer alluded to the subject most likely to increase Henry's confusion"What would I give" said she "to have been a sylph or some other spirit to have been present yet unseen at the reading of my hurried but heartfelt letter to Caroline"  "Present at ityou presentgood heaven" exclaimed Henry throwing up his hands and eyes  "I dare say" continued Olivia "you all thought mebut yetI hope"  Her blushes deepened and the faultering of her voice augmented  "I hope Caroline did not shew itGraciousif she did I should never forgive her yet" recovering herself "wherefore should I talk thus wherefore attempt to  conceal the pride and triumph of my life O Henry my deardearHenry grant me a portion of your eloquence that I may express what I feel at the thought of calling HenryI know not what I would sayI only know that I am the most honoured and blessed of human beingsand that it is his goodness love and constancy have made me so"  Her eyes were directed to those of Henry as her artless heart thus poured itself forth to her now almost husband for in his late absence the two fathers had at last fixed the eventful day of those nuptials which had a thousand times come into the sport and seriousness of the family conversation but Lady Fitzorton had communicated it in form to Olivia a few minutes before she set out to meet Henry  The eyes of Henry were now cast a different wayand they were filled with tears  "Ah hope and glory of my life" exclaimed Olivia"wherefore do you weep If those tears like mine proceed not from  excess of tendernessexcess of felicitythe earth b  ars not such a wretch as Olivia"  "They do the almighty searcher of hearts knowsthey do proceed" said Henry passionately "from tenderness"  "That omnipotent witness be praised" ejaculated Olivia "And yet methinks I would not have such drops as these flow from my Henry's heart even though they spring from joy"  Archangels might have sanctioned the movement with which Olivia now laid her cheek to that of Henry and dried up his tears Alas the fountain was full and streamed afresh  "Yonder is an arboring tree with a bench round itI see it through the underwood" said Olivia gently drawing Henry towards the place  "Let us rest awhile" continued she "for I have somethingveryvery dear to impart to my Henry"  Henry suffered himself to be led passively on when reaching the bench he sat down Olivia placing herself by his side  "I protest" said Olivia resuming her cheerfulness that Henry might catch the gaiety "this spot seems formed for tender heartsdoth it not HenryOne would imagine these bowering hawthorns and these o'erarching shades branching from this romantic oak had been the scene of some gentle assignation in days of chivalry"  Every word she spoke though designed to convey more than the rose's fragrance to his sense was sharper than a thorn pressing into his heart His disappointments were all brought close under his very eye and wherever he turned memory presented some bleeding image of former felicity untimely destroyed even in the spot which was at once the place of its birth and burial  He turned his head as to conceal his agitations when those initials of Caroline's name which his own hand had carved in the rind of the oak met his view and the words "O my only life and love" burst spontaneously from his heart The name of Caroline which was about to follow this passionate exclamation quivered and died  on his lips yet wholly subdued by a situation so affecting he sunk down on Olivia's shoulder and he had only strength enough to sigh out "Thisthisis too much"  Olivia naturally applied to herself the abovementioned tender expression so characteristc of Henry's habits and so congenial to the rahpsody of her own heart and she supposedas how indeed could she imagine otherwisehe was melted by that overwhelming sensibility which might well be excited in a disposition like his by the avowal she had made of boundless returns of her affection "And ah in what language but your own" cried she chastely but fondly caressing him her own lovely eyes repaying him with largest interest every tear"oh in what language but Henry's can I answer such tendernessMy only life my only love Yes" added she exalting her voice without diminishing its sweetness "that divinity to whom my beloved had just appealed in testimony of his own faith can tell how truly my love and life are devoted to him alone"  Henry raised himself up as if to rectify the misconstruction which had been put on an expression that Olivia had so naturally appropriated but the sudden appearance of little Fitz and in the ensuing moment the sound of a voice exclaiming "there is the dogdepend upon it his friends are not far off"pointed his attention to other objects  CHAPTER XLIII  HENRY and Olivia without expressing their surprise to each other hasted through the opening in the bushes to explore the cause when they observed Sir Armine and Lady Fitzorton coming up the avenue and within a few paces of them  Olivia who had caught up little Fitz in silent rapture ran down the avenue to meet them and in a whisper assured Lady Fitzorton that Henry was the best creature in the world and had made her the happiest"With all his ardours you know my dear madam" said she "he is not a man of professions  more delicately trusting to actions than words in attestation of his feelingsa conduct I have often vainly attempted to imitate and which I have admired even when I could have quarrelled with him for it But had you heard the endearing expressions he just uttered accompanied by his tears and witnessed by his lovedeclaring eyesO heavenindeedindeedI am the happiestand he is the best of human beings"  During the display of this delusion which those who admire Olivia will wish might end with her life Henry was advancing but with steps that little justified Olivia's description on an occasion which would have carried himhad he been indeed her loverwith a speed and impatience like her own  Indeed he seemed at first undetermined whether to make his escape by rushing into the woods or to join the family party Perceiving however the latter were moving towards him he thought it would be impossible to recede and after assuring his  stars that he now defied their utmost malice and should resign himself to their malignant power without any farther resistance he somewhat quickened his pace like a man giving himself up despairingly to the worst that could happen Notwithstanding this he saluted his parents with those graces of filial duty which the sight of them always enkindled and which even disappointed love of whose pangs they were in great measure the cause could not extinguish  The sight however of little Fitz whom he had not before seemed to notice had nearly overset his plan of nonresistance "Would it not be best for me dearest madam to step home with that spaniel" said he to his mother "I dare say he watched the opening of the abbey gate to follow me"  Henry held out his arm to receive him from Olivia who sportingly said "she was sure he came again on a message to her from his fair mistress for there was more than ordinary accident in the dog's returning so soon and at such a moment they might depend  on it and she would therefore give him a fair chance either to go or stay"  She gently patted him and set him down observing that she would use no bribery to detain nor any chiding to dismiss him "Let him follow his own unbiassed inclinations" said Olivia "if he goes towards the abbey I declare I will not say a word to call him back but if he attends any of us uncalled I shallyes you may laugh at my superstition as much as you pleasebut I shall think there is more in it than common chanceand expect a welcome for him at the castle till I can have an opportunity to return him to his lovely owner in personTherenow for itHe is now to do as he likes Say nothing but let us walk on and leave him to himself"  Little Fitz was no sooner set upon the ground than he paid his compliments first to Henry then to the rest of the company and bounding along the avenue in the direct line towards the castle seemed to confirm the prepossession of Olivia who now  roundly reasserted nothing should persuade her there was not more in it than even the philosophy of John had he been present could find out  Sir Armine who had attended rather to the history of his son's face than to what had been said about the dog caught the eye of Henry and overruled whatever farther arguments or objections he might have been disposed to make so the whole groupe went together to the castle At first they walked arm in arm in a row but soon after they divided two and twoOlivia and Lady Fitzorton Sir Armine and Henry This arrangement was again altered by design or accident for Sir Armine proposed that his wife and Olivia should make the best of their way home and that he and Henry would take a poetical saunter and follow at leisure averring that he wished to discuss with him a  knotty  point  The emphasis with which he pronounced these words and the smile that accompanied  them was so well understood by her ladyship that she pleasantly exclaimed walking away with Olivia at the same time "Pray my dear daughter let us leave these poetic philosophers to settle their  knotty  points by themselves while you and I" whispered she to Olivia who crimsoned at the remark "go and prepare some other knots that shall prove too hard for both their worships" Olivia turned back thrice on pretence of seeing whether little Fitz preferred the male or the female division of the party but possibly for a more affectionate reason The sagacious and political little animal however seemed to keep like James Fitzorton the midway between them and so continued to hold well with both parties a line of conduct which has been faithfully followed by much greater politicians  We would forbear to insert these minutiae were we not assured that the real great events in life are as some one has profoundly observed produced by a nice train of little circumstances  For example this apparenly trifling matter of filing off the family groupe into divisions led to an incident of as great importance to Henry and perhaps to our readers as any hitherto recorded in this history  END OF VOL II
