 THE PERPLEXITIES A COMEDY  As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN  COVENTGARDEN  Conamur tenues grandia  HORAT  LONDON Printed for W GRIFFIN in CatharineStreet in the Strand and G KEARSLY in LudgateStreet  Price  d  ADVERTISEMENT  THE editor of this Comedy thinks it his duty to declare that in point of fable he is entirely indebted to an old play wrote by  Sir Samuel Tuke  called the  Adventures of Five Hours  of which piece  Echard  in the preface to his translation of  Terence  after noticing some particular excellencies gives this general character viz  This is one of the pleasantest stories that ever appeared upon our stage and has as much variety of plots and intrigues without any thing being precipitated improper or unnatural as to the main action  This encomium and the request of a particular friend induced an attempt to restore so excellent a story to the stage Finding on examination of the original the language to consist entirely of measure and rhyme a style by no means suited to the use of comedy it appeared indispensably necessary to  newwrite  it This arduous task was not undertaken without much fear and diffidence If the piece as it now stands should be fortunate enough to meet the least favour the editor will with the utmost readiness charge such success to his having in  general  adhered closely to the  Original  pursued the  same disposition of scenery and preserved as many of the sentiments as could be introduced without clogging or interrupting the action What  particular  alterations he has presumed to make are with great deference submitted to the Candour of the Public  Since the copy was delivered to the press some few passages have been shortened in representation which are easily distinguishable by the attentive reader  ⁂ This Comedy having been treated with very distinguished marks of candour and encouragement in the representation the Editor thinks it his duty to return his most grateful thanks to the Public  PROLOGUE  Mr BEARD enters hastily  I Speak a PrologueWhat strange whim I wonder  Could lead the author into such a blunder  I ask'd the man as muchbut he poor devil  Fancied a Manager might make you civil  "Garrick  says he can with a Prologue tame  "The Critic's rageWhy can't you do the same"  Because quoth I the case is diff'rent quite  Garrick  you know can Prologues speak and write  If like that  Roscius  I could write and speech it  I might command applause and not beseech it  But sure for one who all his livelong days  Has dealt in Crotchets Minims and Solfa's  A Singer to stand forth in Wit's defence  And plead 'gainst Sound the solemn cause of Sense  Persuade an audience that a play has merit  Without a single Air to give it spirit  'Tis so much out of characterso wrong  No Prologue sir for meunless in Song  The fame quoth I you poets reap  And all your gains are owing  To sounds that even measure keep  And stanzas smoothly flowing  But me the lyre wou'd better suit  Than verses of Apollo  The fiddle hautboy horn or flute  I'm always us'd to follow  "Sir says he you'll mar  "My verse and meaning too"  Sir must I turn fool  To humour such as you  I'll sing it if you please  "Sing cries he in huff  "Of you and your Solfa's  "The town has had enough"  Oh then I bounc'd and swore  Was I much to blame  Had you been in my place  Why you'd have done the same  If for oldfashion'd tunes he's not too nice  I'd give him fifty of 'em in a trice  With words more fitted to his purpose here  Than all the rhimes he'd jingle in a year  He challeng'd me to shew a single sample  Of what I bragg'dI didas for example  The scene is prepar'd the Critics are met  The judges all rang'da terrible shew  E're tryal begins the Prologue's a debt  A debt on demandso take what we owe  And this is the way Mr Author  To trick a plain muse up with art  In modish Fallal's you must cloathe her  And warm a cold Critic's hard heart  With a Fallallal c  Wherefore I thus entreat with due submission  Between the bard and me you'd make decision  The whole now on your arbitration we rest  And Prologues henceforward shall surely be drest  In what mode soever your taste shall like best  Which none of us dare deny  For howe'er cruel critics and witlings may sneer  That at times I alas somewhat  dunny  appear  If to you my best friends I e'er  turn my deaf ear  May you your indulgence deny  Then for his sake and mine for we're both in a fright  Till a treat of more goût shall your palates delight  Let a poor humble Comedy please you tonight  Which surely you will not deny

Don  JUAN  HENRIQUEZ  NO more cousin I beseech you all your rhetoric will not persuade me to leave so important a care as the honour of our family to the caprice of a giddy girl It was a charge committed absolutely to me by our parents on their deathbed and I alone must be answerable for any blemish on that honour  Juan  I have no doubt Don  Henriquez  but that this your extreme haste takes it's rise from prudence but may not even our virtues be sometimes overstrain'd and have their dangerous effects  'Tis from this fear that I have often presum'd to interpose and must repeat it wou'd it not be better to let your sister see and make herself acquainted with the disposition of the man with whom she is to pass her life  Hen  Which is in other words to give her more opportunity for devices and to try whether she cannot frustrate my designsno noan agreeable young girl shou'd never be left to her own directiontricks plots and contrivances are so innate in them they will couzen themselves rather than their imaginations shou'd want employment I have seen too many instances of their vanity giddiness ingratitude wellwellI have within this hour receiv'd intelligence from the Marquis  d'Olivera  thro' whose generous intervention my designs are at last come to maturity that the person to whom she has been so long contracted Don  Antonio de Mendoza  Juan  Is he the man The very name removes half my objections Why has it been so long concealed  Hen  Because I wou'd not give my sister's enterprising genius either time or means to counteract my purposesbut now the prospect of a speedy conclusion of the whole affair renders that secrecy no longer necessary this evening he will arrive from  Flanders  and so well convinc'd am I of the propriety of my conduct I will not sleep till they are married  Juan  Notwithstanding his undoubted merit I cannot yet be reconcil'd to that unreasonable custom of contracting persons who never saw each other compelling them to be of the same opinion in the most important concern of life before you know whether they cou'd agree about the most insignificant  Hen  I wou'd only compel her to her good and think I am the best judge what measures to pursueOpinions indeedIf you Don  Juan  delay the disposal of your sister in marriage till she is able to determine what her opinion is or to express myself conformably to your easy temper till she has fix'd her affections she may give you a brotherinlaw very ill suited to your choice and judgment  Juan  Strange that your understanding education and travels shou'd not have allay'd that severe opinion of women by strangers imputed to us as a national fault and indeed with too much justice  Hen  Persons who cannot comprehend the motives which actuate such as are wiser than themselves ever make strange interpretations of their conduct I am determin'd no longer to endure the daily the hourly anxieties and fears which a solicitude for  Honoria  's conduct has given me this night they end  Juan  I have had the like charge of a sister you know these thirteen years and cannot recollect a pain mine ever gave to me  Hen  The comparison don't hold their dispositions are different yet I wish Don  Juan  you may not suffer for your easiness of temper you give the reins too much into your sister's hands the thoughtlessness of youth and passions uncontroul'd may lead her far astray 'tis too much to be fear'd I have strong reasons have nicely weigh'd her conductyou may repent  Juan  I know what you allude to but the transactions of that fatal night are far from alarming me about  Felicia  's conduct 'tis true Don  Pedro  was kill'd under my balcony you throw the deed on  Florio  and his flight seems to justify the accusation yet what reproach does this cast on  her For when I offer'd in consequence of your assertion that he had dishonourable designs on her to interfere with you in his behalf to stop the prosecution and give her hand to him if her happiness consisted therein she utterly declin'd it assuring me she had no one motive to wish for such an event but many to avoid it  Hen  You are too blind  Juan  And you too suspicious why shou'd she deceive me Have I not ever assur'd her I wou'd consult her inclination  Hen  Ay there's the curse that ties my tongue  Aside  Juan  I therefore cannot will not doubt her Her heart is generous and honest on such dispositions indulgence weighs more than severity and cou'd you be induc'd to alter your conduct towards  Honoria  but I ask pardon your own judgment must be your director short as my absence has been events may have occur'd which may render me now an incompetent adviserYour sister is mistress of many virtues and fame speaks loudly of  Antonio  as a man a scholar and a soldier  Hen  On those considerations let our argument die I am determin'd Will you accompany me to our friend and kinsman the corregidor I wou'd require him to be a witness and partaker of our ceremonies tonight  Juan  I will but conduct my sister to her cousin  Honoria  to whom she has devoted this evening and attend you  Hen  Shall I expect you in the Piazza  Juan  You may  Exit  Hen  A man with a heart at ease like his may well preach such doctrine but I carry a load of inquietude in mineMy sister married one  weighty care is remov'd but a far heavier remainsUngrateful blind  Felicia  what sufferings am I doom'd to undergo yet know not how to utter or relieve them to love adore doubt fear suspect despair yet still persist to love I blush at my own weaknessto apply and be refus'd were a perpetual thorn to me and that from her blind prepossession to another and  Juan  's passive acquiescence to her choice is almost certain rivall'd too in her affections by a man who but a short time before had ask'd my sister of me my pride my honour is insulted revenge is my only remedy in that I will persist and experience its utmost efficacy  Exit  SCENE HONORIA  's Apartment  Enter  HONORIA  Hon  Wou'd  Felicia  were come her kind and chearful temper might give me some reliefYet how can I expect it This tyrant brother can I call him less to compel me to marry a man I never saw while the chosen of my heart is forc'd to avoid meis rejected My brother's hatred cou'd scarce entail on me a greater misery than his careYet what can I do His power over me is unlimitedno alternative left but what is desperate yet something must be done I cannot thus tamely subscribe to my own unhappiness  Enter  JUAN  introducing  FELICIA  Juan  With pleasure I escort my sister to so dear and amiable a friendmethinks 'tis pity even a wall shou'd make the houses two of neighbours so entirely one  Fel  Yes and the houses are more entirely one than you imagine my dear brother thanks to our private door  Aside  Hon  We have ever thought the slightest separation inconsistent with our friendshipYou oblige me with a most welcome favour in uniting us now 'tis a degree of charity and I thank you Am I to be honour'd with your company too  Juan  I cou'd with great pleasure stay but an engagement with your brother calls me and the least trespass on his punctilious temper you know  Hon  Shall I call my cousin mine for the night  Juan  Her own inclination is her ruler Your most obedient  Exit  Fel  There's a brother for youupon my word if he were not so related I shou'd be apt to mistake him for a lover  Hon  And give him encouragement perhaps  Fel  Undoubtedly if my heart were free and I cou'd be convinc'd that same politeness would not abate on marriage a little of that you know goes a great way in a husbandBut am I never to see my sweet friend smile again  Hon  I wou'd willingly put off my grief to avoid disturbing your gaiety but am not able  Fel  Then let me put off my gaiety that I may not interrupt your grief there is often ease in the indulgence of it and I am too giddy for you Tell me my dear  Honoria  how can I metamorphose myself so as to suit your feelings I wou'd be or do any thing that might give you pleasure  Hon  You never fail to do thatYour every look and word has affection in it and that agreeable manner of setting them off makes what wou'd be stil'd levity in others a virtue in you as it's only spring is from a desire to entertain  Fel  Deliver'd with singular judgment and politeress your's to the very ground  Hon  Engaging playfulness how can so tender so susceptible a heart as yours be so much at ease in it's present doubtful and anxious situation  Fel  Why that's trueand it is sometimes otherwise but as I have not to charge fortune or friends with any actual affliction I bear accidental ills as well as I am able and endeavour to keep sorrow at arm's length My hopes I think grow faster than my fears and I trust to the great midwife Time to bring forth the fruits of 'em  Hon  And may they answer your deserts I have almost lost a part of my grief in my amazement at the adventures you were relating to me last night when my lordly brother interrupted us  Fel  Yes absence is a pretty whet to affection now and then he is ten times worse than ever there's no getting a moment now his love and jealousy together keep him in a perpetual fidget  Hon  I cou'd not sleep for thinking of your story  Fel  Ay is it not a fine one since the days of don  Quixotte  to this present seven o'clock in the evening sure never was a better subject for romanceLet me see I'll enumerate the particulars TravelsSurprizesWarsDrumsTrumpetstaken prisonerattack'd by a ruffiansav'd by a heroic selfdefenceSwooningRecoveryand such a recovery in the arms of a handsome young fellow O lud cousin  Hon  Who had kill'd the attempter of your honour too  Fel  Oh noyou forgetI had the credit of the victory over himAs soon as he began to use violence I seiz'd his dagger and menac'd his destruction ay and meant it too when a sudden alarm and fear for his own safety reliev'd me from the monster  Hon  But how came you depriv'd of your brother's assistance  Fel  I was coming to that when Don  Henriquez  interrupted usin defending himself and me which he did a long time with great galantry ere we were taken prisoners he receiv'd some slight wounds and was lodg'd in an upper apartment of the houseI was taken to a pavilion in the garden which I presume the wretch who assaulted me thought most fit for his wicked purposes  Hon  Your attachments to your relation the Count  D'Oniate  and the concern your brother had in his embassy to the emperor threaten'd surely a longer absence What occasion'd your return  Fel  My brother was suddenly recall'd to his regiment by royal command and the necessity for using dispatch in our return to  Sevil  induc'd him to take the nearest roadtoo near the enemies quartersand thence we were made prisoners  Hon  I am sure I have sensibly partaken every fear and distress during your relation and lament the necessity that involv'd you in such perplexities tho' it restor'd so much of my happiness to meAnd you dearly love the noble soldier who offered to revenge your injuries or die beside you  Fel  Most entirelyI always speak truth you know if a sudden passion a firstsight love is justifiable in any one it is surely so in me I suppose gratitude may have some share but then such a person such looks such wordshowever I am mistaken if I did not leave him as much cause to remember the adventure as he did me  Hon  Why then did he leave you so abruptly  Fel  What cou'd the poor soul do the trumpets summon'd him his men call'd loudly for their commander there was to be sure a notable  combat between love and honour but honour got the better and I honour him for it  Hon  And what was this gallant hero's name  Fel  I know not I had neither means nor time to enquire the moment my brother had recover'd some few hours strength we were oblig'd to set offBut enough of my affairs how stand my sweet friend's  Hon  Worse and worse  Felicia  so near a crisis that my brother is determin'd on my marrying this night  Fel  My brother hinted as much as we came here but I cou'd scarce believe it  Hon  'Tis too true  Henriquez  has just receiv'd advice that the person to whom I am contracted will arrive this evening  Fel  How absurd and cruel and poor  Florio  Hon  Now doubly banish'd first from my brother's positive forbiddance of his addresses and visits on account of this unhappy contract and then from the illfated death of Don  Pedro  whom in selfdefence you know he kill'd if he is found my brother's evidence must condemn him to the law and his resentment seeks all occasions to compass the most severe gratifications  Fel  Rash inconsiderate unfeeling man Was not his savage love of me the cause which drives him hourly to some mad extreme Then that unlucky similitude of dress which led him to believe  Florio  was entertaining me that fatal evening in our balcony nay allowing his suspicions had been grounded in truth cou'd nothing appease him but assassinating  Florio  and hazarding his friend Don  Pedro  in so bafe a cause Can he suppose such desperate such terrifying proofs of passion which while his pride will not suffer him to own he weakly fancies is unseen wou'd not disgust my heart  Hon  However he has disdain'd to trust a woman I wonder his friendship with your brother has not induc'd him to ask your hand of him  Fel  Oh my dear two most weighty reasons are against it first his pride lest he shou'd be refus'd secondly my brother's strong dislike of forc'd marriages to which he is no stranger tho' between you and me my dear my brother is as well convinc'd of his passion as we are and proceeded so far as to apply to me thereon but finding my aversion my horror at the very mention of it according to his accustom'd tenderness he has never since reassum'd the topic but has  Henriquez  at last graciously been pleas'd to tell you your intended husband's name  Hon  He has  Felicia  this day at dinner not a moment sooner  Fel  May not I know it  Hon  He is call'd  Antonio de Mendoza  Enter  HENRIQUEZ  Hen  I am pleas'd  Honoria  to hear you talking of your husband it gives me hope your conduct will deserve the happiness I am providing for youhave you the letter ready which I injoin'd you to write to him I'll send a servant with it to meet him on the way and give him entire possession of that range of apartments design'd for him to shew how absolutely next to myself he is master here'tis a respect which persons of condition reciprocally challenge  Enter  SYLVIO  Syl  A servant from Don  Antonio  is just alighted at the gate with letters to your lordship  Hen  I cou'd not have receiv'd more welcome  news admit him Sister conduct your lovely friend within  Exeunt  Honoria  and  Felicia  Exquisite enchanting misjudging woman  Enter  SYLVIO  with  ERNESTO  Ern  Sir Don  Antonio  kisses your hands with this letter  Servants salute  Hen  I'm glad to find he is in health yet he seems to think the hour of his arrival uncertain else I wou'd myself meet and conduct him hither  Ern  Tho' the hour is uncertain signor yet he will undoubtedly be here to night for he has appointed the very place where I am to wait for him  Hen  You are returning thither now  Ern  As soon as I have receiv'd your commands signor  Hen  I'll answer this forthwith then give you your whole commission While I write make the me  enger welcome  Exit  Sylvio  with  Ernesto  I hope nothing will prevent his coming this evening I grow more and more impatientthere's danger in delayhowever  Honoria  may put on a spe  ous complaisance I know her her head is quick to contrive and her heart desperate to execute Let but  Antonio  come and she shall not remain unmarried a single hour  Exit  Enter  HONORIA FELICIA  and  ROSA  Hon  You see how arrogant and absolute he is  Fel  Yet his proud heart felt a smart twinge from my keen eyes just now or I'm mistaken  Hon  Watch'd like a culprit commanded like a slave torn from the man I love forc'd to a man I have not an idea of  Fel  Od's my life girl don't stand enumerating  our distresses but think how we may remove 'em we shall mend nothing by complaining something must be contriv'd  Hon  But they come so quick upon us  Fel  If they come too quick for a woman's invention they are such as never came before  Hon  I have it  Fel  I knew it  Hon  Lend me your veil cousin  Rosa  run and see whether my brother is settled to dispatch  Antonio  's man  Exit  Rosa  Fel  What's your scheme quick  Hon  If my brother is set down to write I think I may say an hour is securely mine for his extravagant suspicion makes him distrust the sense of his own words and he'll weigh a subscription to a scruple lest he shou'd degrade his dignity by his style therefore I'll to  Florio  let him know the straits to which I am driven and that all hopes are over unless he can devise some prompt expedient to relieve us  Fel  But where d'ye think to see him  Hon  At the house where he is conceal'd 'tis not far off I'll venture  Fel  D'ye know the way  Hon  No but  Rosa  can conduct me she has been often there  Enter  ROSA  Rosa  Your brother ma'amcoming already  Fel  Provoking  Hon  Into my chamberquick  Exeunt  Honoria  and  Felicia  Enter  HENRIQUEZ  with  ERNESTO  Hen  Since you are so desirous friend you shall be indulg'd in seeing her  Ern  I shou'd be glad to have it in my power signor to tell my master I had that honour  Hen  Where's your lady  Rosa  Rosa  In her chamber sir  Hen  Acquaint her that  Antonio  's man requests to pay his duty to her before he goes  Exit  Rosa  Wait here she will come to you you will probably find a kinswoman with her but may distinguish your future mistress by being in her homedress without her veil I will go and compleat my letter  Exit  Henriquez  Enter  HONORIA FELICIA  and  ROSA  Ernesto  addresses  Felicia  Ern  I have been bold to request the honour of seeing your ladyship that I may be more welcome to my lord at my return  Hon  An odd mistakefurther it my dear girl it may lead to something no matter what drowning people catch at straws  Fel  Friend in what state left you your lord and mine  Ern  As happy madam as the hopes of being your's cou'd make him  Fel  I pray present my service to him and say I shall be rejoic'd to hear he has compleated his journey safely and in health my good wishes attend him Friend farewell  Exeunt  Honoria Felicia  and  Rosa  Ern  Egad she's a lovely creature my master will be ravish'd when he sees her I begin to  hope this blind bargain made by proxy may prove as good as the old ones made by love and that those pretty eyes of her's may coax his wits back again which I think he has lost raving eternally about some unknown damsel whom he fancies in his fielderrantry he recover'd from a trance and he has dreamt of it ever sinceI'll go wake him with this good news  Exit  Ern  Enter  HONORIA FELICIA  and  ROSA  Fel  And yet for the soul of me notwithstanding our vexations I cou'd hardly forbear laughing at the formal fool's mistakeDid not I prim myself up with a pretty prudish reserve Was it like you cousin  Hon  There's no saying what may be the consequence of the mistake but it was a lucky thing for me I'm sure for I shou'd not have known how to speak for myself  Rosa  Madam do we go What do you resolve  Fel  That's true your brother can't be much longer and if when he returns he shou'd miss you from your apartmentI don't think you can venture now  Hon  What's the hour  Rosa  Rosa  Near eight madam the clock struck seven before Donna  Felicia  enter'd the chamber  Hon  I dare not venture now indeed run  Rosa  fetch your veil  Exit  Rosa  I'll appoint him in my tablets time and place where he shall meet me and  Rosa  shall carry 'em  Fel  That's well but where do you design your interview  Hon  In the remotest part of the garden which fronts my apartment you know where I have often met him since your absence depriv'd us of the  advantages of your friendly assistance and the private door to your portion of Don  Juan  's house  Rosa  has a key to the backdoor of our garden  Fel  And how cou'd she get that Not by fair means I'm sure  Henriquez  us'd to be as tenacious of his keys as of his longspun pedigree and even open'd a door himself with as much cautious fear as if he apprehended a piece of his ancestry shou'd make it's escape at it  Hon  Rosa  artfully procur'd me an impression of my brother's key one day when some sudden intelligence hurried him abroad in search of  Florio  and by that we got one made  Fel  Well contriv'd my notable girl  Enter  ROSA  veil'd  Hon  Shall I beg your patience while I write  Fel  This was a lucky accident for you  Rosa  you may chance to fee your fond lover  Guzman  Rosa  He is a fond lover of himself I believe madam and without a rival  Fel  Are you sure your words and thoughts agree  Rosa  I'm not so very old to be in my dotage ma'am  Fel  Nor so very young but you may be in love Dotage and love are cousingermans  Rosa  Rosa  They may when we encourage a passion at first sight madam and indulge it without a chance of successotherwise not quite so nearly related  Fel  Pert and witty enough that I have provok'd a wasp and am stung by it  Hon  My dear  Rosa  make all the haste you are able  Rosa  I'll fly ma'am has  Florio  the other key of the tablets  Hon  Yes yespray dispatch  Rosa  Never doubt me madam for all my own fortune is betted on your game  Exit  Rosa  Fel  There she goes which is nimblest her heels or her tongue I wonder Come my dear girl try to wear a more chearful aspect if we are reduc'd to desperate measures why let the person who causes it be blam'd  Hon  He justly wou'd deserve it tho' nothing but the last distress I think shou'd urge me to such measures as the world might censure yet were not my affections so strongly preengag'd to a delicate feeling surely it is no trifling wound to be oblig'd to give a worthy man a hand without a heart  Fel  Come come hope welland do not torment your mind any furtherlet us retire to your chamber and while we wait  Rosa  's return I'll try to raise your spirits with your favourite song  Hon  My sweet friend I fear the cold regard I shall pay will ill deserve such a kind and agreeable offer  In vain we seek relief from outward things  'Tis from within alone sort quiet springs  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II SCENE I  SCENE a Marketplace  Enter  ANTONIO  and  SANCHO  in RidingSuits  SANCHO  WHAT a confounded pace we have come but you are always the same sir You proceed in the attack of a mistress with as much vigour and activity as you storm a garrison  Ant  Dispatch is the soul of every undertaking I hate all that savours of coldness and delay In a pursuit so insipidly carried on the spirits relax and tho' you gain your ends you scarce relish the successWhat do you smile at  Sancho  San  You expect the truth sir  Ant  You know I do I cannot brook falshood even in the veriest trifles lest the mind be insensibly led on to practise it in material affairs and thereby entail on itself such a reproach as most disgraces manhood  San  Why then sir I smiled at the oddity of your amours First to fall in love with one you hardly ever saw and then make such haste to marry one you never saw We poor mortals have another method  Ant  Your reflections like those of the world in general are too hasty and superficial not knowing my motives you wonder at my conduct How many faultless characters thro' too severe and premature conclusions have had a shade drawn over them which time and reason have at last wholly removed  San  Sir I ask pardon if I have offended  Ant  You cannot easily offend You have gain'd on my temper and won an indulgence which your courage and fidelity well deserve  San  But sir you are earlier than you expected by an hour almost  Ant  'Tis true  San  Then suppose sir you return to the posthouse and lay aside these unnecessary implements for walking then if you please you may relieve your legs a little more I can stay in the house to be ready when  Ernesto  comes according to your orders  Ant  I like your counsel wellfollow me  Exeunt  SCENE  a Street representing the House where  FLORIO  dwells  Enter from his House  FLORIO  with  GUZMAN  both cloaked  Flo  Come  Guzman  now we may venture to quit our dens take a little fresh air and begin chace  Guz  Chace now the sun is set Of what sir Owls or bats Call you this making love'Tis much more like making warmarching all night in arms as if we were going to beat up the enemies quarters on a forlorn hope  Flo  Would not you venture as much for  Rosa  Guz  No in good faith sir I shall venture enough if I marry her I'll run no hazards before hand  Flo  That's from your fear not your prudence  Guz  Sir you may call it what you please but I dare boldly say there lives not a more valiant man in the world than myself while danger keeps at distance but when faucily it presses on me  then I confess I have a certain tenderness for life which checks my ardour and inclines my prudence to make a timely retreat  Flo  How civil your stile is to yourselfand how prettily you soften that harsh word cowardicebut I think I have seen your valour pleas'd to run away when danger has not been so very pressing  Guz  It may not have appear'd so sir to common eyes but I have such a piercing sight that I can discover perils at a greater distance than any man in  Spain  Other people poor souls not being blessed with such perspicuity do not descry dangers time enough to shun 'em and then their struggling is by the injudicious world called courage  Flo  A man truly valiant will always remain so  Guz  A man wisely valiant will avoid all the danger he can  Flo  You have more light than heat I'll allow  Guzman  But your humour and honesty make amends for your want of courage  Guz  I have courage enough for the profession my parents design'd me for  Flo  What was that  Guz  A lawyer I could have put on rare anger in my client's sight and when he was gone have hugged the advocate of the opposite party and if I don't mistake sir those gentry sell their breath much dearer than you gentlemen soldiers sell your blood 'tis true you get honoura fine light food for delicate appetitesyet I have known some captains of plain stomachs fast upon it  Flo  The knave's rightbut how I trifle time What's this to my embarrassments in loveHow shall I contrive to hear from my  Honoria  Shall I venture to my old hauntsI dare notTo what purpose should I unless she were preadvised of  it This last unhappy accident left to solitude and thoughtand that loaded with the disagreeable reflection of having shed another's bloodwhich tho' it chanced in selfdefence my reason and education will not let me easily digestYet  Honoria  she must be mine and I will leave no peril unencounter'd to obtain herIf after all I failif I must lose her at least I will deserve her  Enter  ANTONIO  and  SANCHO  Ant  I am tired with waiting  San  He cannot be long now sir surely  Ant  I'll take another minute's turngo you back to the inn and wait me there  Exit  San  I scarce can tell the name of any place I see 'Tis so long since I was in this city I have lost all my measures of it  Flo  Do my eyes cheat me or is that my comrade when I first bore arms My friend  Antonio  If it be he as sure it must I cannot dread to know him  Ant  Florio  Flo  My honour'd friend  Ant  You were too long in recollecting meYour friendship cannot cool  Flo  Neverbut your presence here so unexpected made me disbelieve my sightWhen came you to town  Ant  I just now arrived  Flo  I rejoice to see you but should have thought it more likely to hear of you at court pursuing the recompence due to your deserts  Ant  An employment I am neither fond nor capable of I cannot sue even for my right 'Tis myambition to merit but not solicit reward The dignity of honour suffers in it If praise and advancement do not follow our services we  must learn to pay ourselves by a noble contempt of worldly favours  Flo  A severe rule indeed which virtue prescribes to herselfto be so backward in claiming a reward she is so eager to deserve  Ant  By no means She is more hurt in being reduced to beg reward than she can be in the want of itBesides a true subject hazards his life in the service of his king and country for the advancement of their honour and interest solely he who does it with a view to his own deserves neither praise nor reward  Flo  The same great and generous spirit as ever I honour the day which introduced me to the knowledge of so much worth  Ant  What merit I have I can but faintly call my ownI inherit it from a father whose example of courage and integrity it had been scandalous in a son not to have imitated  Flo  This is my house at present  Antonio  Will you honour it by calling it your's Tho' you must excuse many deficiencies in your entertainment I am but in an ill condition at present to receive the honour of such a guest having by an unhappy accident been obliged lately to change my usual place of residence and keep myself concealed  Ant  Concealedbut that is for a future hour and more suitable placeI must however decline your kind offer a while being forced to remain hereabouts lest I should miss the return of one whom I sent to my brotherinlaw's  Flo  You surprize meHave you a brotherinlaw in  Seville  Ant  I have I came hither a married man as far as friends could make me  Flo  Since then it so imports you not to miss your servant I will keep you company here

speaks loudly but not distinctlyCould you not oblige me while you are waiting for your servant  Ant  Excuse meI cannotif there be any merit in my behaviour my own breath would fully itif not the report is not fit for a friend's earBut if you chuse to fill up the time I'll give you an adventure of mine which I fancy will repay your attention  Flo  You will oblige me  Ant  And when 'tis finished you will wonder how with such a prepossession in my heart I should be induced to come here to marry a stranger  Flo  Your preface awakes my curiosityto the story I beseech you  Ant  On the evening following that glorious day whereon the Duke of  Alva  gain'd such distinguish'd reputation I was dispatch'd with some horse to cover the  Limbourg  frontiers which were too much exposed to the enemy's inroadsWe were scarce arrived when I receiv'd intelligence that a party of them about cavalry were newly lodged in a village three leagues off We instantly sounded to horse and not to trouble you with particulars so great was our expedition that by daybreak their quarters were on fire  Flo  You experienced the utility of your own maxim that diligence in execution is the mistress of success  Ant  Our foes made but faint resistancesome were slainsome fled to give alarm to their reserves in quarters remoteThe tumult nigh over I  to a lofty structure supposing it  was their leader's quarterwith intention to preserve him from the soldier's rage and his building from the firebut what was my surprize when entering a pavilion in the garden I beheld a woman of a matchless form stretched on the marble floor  Flo  Your heart suffered then I am surePity and bravery always dwell together  Ant  I felt what I cannot describetho' at first I believ'd her dead yet her appearance inspir'd me with such awe and reverence that I could not without trembling venture to approach herI knelt and raised her in my arms when strait a sigh stole from her I knew it not for a sound of grief while it was a sign of life At last she open'd her lovely eyes and beam'd such looks spite of her sad situation as I had ne'er experienced Awhile I was held mute with wonder and delight when a poniard fell from her fair handas if she only wanted arms asleep and waking trusted to her eyesMy sensations encreased each momentwhen I recover'd power to speak I saidI know not whatIt was all extasy yet it had its rise in sincerityShe endeavour'd to reply but could notyet she looked such sweet surprizesuch gratitudetho' mixed with fear  Flo  I am all impatience  Ant  I renewed my ardent professionsoffer'd my life for the recovery of her'sI labour'd to know her storyThe crimson in her cheeks seemed reviving and her speech returning when a sudden loud blast of trumpets and outcry of my men alarmed me They were charged with squadrons of fresh horse whom the fugitives had called from neigbouring villages I longed to stay with herI panted to be with themmy powers for a time were suspendedbut awaking  to that sense of honour from which no claim should alienate a soldier I tore myself away The situation of my mind added to my usual heatI was desperate in fight and sustained so many wounds that I swooned with loss of blood while my soldiers compleated the victory and brought me off  Flo  I feel for you in all  Ant  My outward wounds were slight and quickly healed but those within deep and still so  ly bleeding My heart and happiness seem'd utterly to have forsaken me My enquiries after her were vain and I returned to my post in the army loaded with the despair of ever seeing her again from whom my aff  ctions can never stray  Flo  You have indeed given me cause for concern as well as wonderSo engaged how comes this strange marriage From what inducements Your mind is above the general temptations of the world  Ant  From duty gratitude and justiceLong before this event I was contracted to the lady whom I now come to marry by the Marquis  D'Oliverc  whose patronage and friendship from my infancy would render my disobedience to a recommendation of his highly improperBesides when he first proposed this match my heart was wholly disengagednow there is no

two hours since I saw a numerous family here and to all appearance well order'd now the pages bolt out of their doors then start back into their holes like rabbits in a warren the maids too as we enter'd were all peeping out of the garret windows like the upper tier of ordnance in a shipall disorder but here comes the servant you sent in  Enter  GERALDO  Ant  Friend where's your master  Ger  I

have not brought me to a wrong house  Ern  If you are sure we are awake sir then am I certain this is the very house wherein this afternoon I saw and spoke both with Don  Henriquez  and your bride by the same token there was a lady with her in a veil and this identical room is the antechamber to your bride's apartment  Ant  Then what can all this mean I dare not suppose the Marquis wou'd be so importunate to have me sacrific'd to such a creature as her own brother is asham'd to shew me  Ern  Don't fear siryou may soon be set right in that point for yonder I see her in the inner room lying on her couch and reading tho' her face is turn'd the other way I'll swear to her shape and cloaths  Ant  Are you quite certain it is she  Ern  There are not many like her sir  Ant  Since you are sure I'll venture in without her brother's introduction  Ern  Soft sir she saves you the trouble and is coming this way  Enter  FELICIA  with a Book  Fel  In short 'tis to no purpose my concern for  Honoria  robs me of all attention  Throws the Book away  Ant  Heavens that lovely form which fearing my revolt appears to prove my constancy and truth  Fel  Defend me who is this Does my mind bear false witness or am I enchanted  Ant  If it be but a vision  Ern  Dear dear what fit of frenzy is this Why sir 'tis  Honoria  no visionbut a lovely living woman and your destin'd bride  Fel  'Tis he

her sake still favour the deceit So gain some time till she returns or hear how she is dispos'd of It shall be soI'll trespass a few moments on the hazard of  Henriquez  's coming to undeceive him sound  Antonio  's sentiments then get off as well as my heart will let me  Aside  Ant  Thou dear resemblance of her whom my soul doats on in pity speakSay art thou that  lovely maid to whom I once presum'd to pay the truest vows of love  Fel  I am  Antonio  that very she whose safety and whose honour you made your generous care and to whom you paid some hasty vows of love  Ant  And is it possible that fortune has compleated what affection began  Fel  I cannot but acknowledge she has been peculiarly propitious to you and I shou'd make an ill return to those vows did I not congratulate you on the blind Goddess's amazing bounty that has given you in the wife to whom you have engag'd yourself the only woman you can love  Ant  No doubt my conduct may seem strange yet hear me speak  Fel  And swear again eternal loveand breath again those ardent protestations which were intended for me alone and not to be transferr'd to an unknown fair  Ant  By my hopes of future happiness I vow that long ere I beheld those eyes  Fel  We have not time for explanations now a further conference wou'd be improper till my brother's sanction has allow'd our interview  Ant  Leave me not dearest lady in this uncertaintygive me the smallest hope that you have ever thought your servant worthy a remembrance then if I cannot justify myself discard despise me utterly  Fel  Esteem that springs from gratitude cannot easily decaylet that suffice and if you are the same  Antonio  generous and noble as you first shew'd to me when in my distress'd situationBut how am I transgressing  Honoria  must act as becomes Don  Henriquez  's sister in his absence longer discourse wou'd be improper our next meeting may be less restrain'd So my mind is something  easier and his penetrating Donship has not interrupted us  Aside  Exit  Ant  To that next meeting then will I look forward and hope shall be my comforter for that she did not deny mePerfection of prudence as of loveliness conscious that I can justify myself in honour and integrity I have no doubt of happiness  Enter  HENRIQUEZ  Hen  Sure he has learn'd the whole e'er this and is gone to meditate revenge  Aside  Ant  Noble Don  Henriquez

 In your's it cannot beI never saw a more accomplish'd creature  Hen  Ha what means he  Aside  Ant  Notwithstanding your absence I have just enjoy'd the happiness of an interview she so far exceeds the rest of her sex I ever saw her beauty wit and discretion are so excellent all favourable circumstances join to make me bless this meeting  Hen  How am I to understand this Can he be in earnest I will if possible contain myself and try to fathom this  Aside  You have then seen and entertained my sister sir  Ant  I have and with such full delight that I think all the pains and toils of my past life exquisitely rewarded in those few moments of her conversation I wish'd them to be prolong'd but her discretion wou'd not suffer too long a visit in your absence and I cou'd not but adore the prudence that robb'd me of such transcendant pleasure  Hen  I am more and more confounded  Aside  She might have spar'd that caution sir since with youshe knew my sentimentswou'd I cou'd get him away  Aside  Shall I have the pleasure to conduct you to your chamber I fear 'tis late and you want rest  Ant  I cou'd not think of troubling you nor indeed any one at present being oblig'd late as it is to

mystery breeds another so delighted with her conversation so enamour'd of her form he seem'd in earnestand then to make such a sudden sally abroad after a long journey too in a place where I shou'd

vengeance on me  Fel  I am all amazementHow came you into his hands  Hon  My  Florio  to whom he proves an intimate friend entrusted me to his care tho' till this moment I never heard his namethat might have alarm'd mebut every slightest circumstance concurs to ruin me  Fel  But were you distracted to let him bring you here or blind not to know your own house  Hon  How could I in such darkness

strange in his words and behaviour which indicates disguise and artifice I must see it expounded  Aside  Exit  Hen  All the feinds in hell sure cou'd not conjure up such another mystery  Juan  affirms the people we fought with had convey'd  Honoria  awaywhen I come to seek her at home she's missing and her waiting wench tells me she went into the garden whence no one knows of her return  Antonio  just after protests he saw and entertain'd her in her own apartment where I certainly now find her and that ungrateful woman with herThese are riddles to pose an Oedipus and madden a stoickThey must be explain'd and shallYet hold  Antonio  said he would return forthwithhere will I wait 'till he arrives see him safe at rest and then extort the whole truth from  Honoria  Could I but be convinced my honour were yet unstain'd I should I think be somewhat easier The load might be a little lighter that's all I'm to expect  No hope of perfect or of lasting rest  While unrequited love corrodes the

sake  Rosa  I shun these honourable engagementshaving lost my weapon the best I can do is to walk off with the baggage  Exit  Guz  with  Rosa  Enter  HENRIQUEZ JUAN ANTONIO JAQUES  and  GERALDO  with Lights  Hen  I will not be persuaded  Juan  Cousin you must I have an honour too to guard dear to me as yours is to you in all that justice sanctifies will I tread step for step but will not permit my house to be the scene of premeditated mischief and revengealready they have stain'd these walls too deeply  Ant  Such admonitions are too sacred surely to pass unregarded  Henriquez  cannot be so lost  Hen  I cannot be so lost to my own honour's calls or nature's feeling to listen to a cynic's cold advice Where is the man whose insolence and folly has so far misled him  Enter  FLORIO  Flo  Here is the man you seek  Hen  What do I see  Flo  Whom thou so basely hast betray'd  Ant  My friend my  Florio  Flo  No more thy friend  Antonio  but  Florio  by thy perfidy betray'd and thrown upon his fate  Hen  Let me pass  Ant  Hold a moment  Hen  What mean you Is all your fervour in a brother's interest reduc'd to a mean parley with the foe I'll right myself  Juan  Cousin forbear you shall not have your way there lies some mystery conceal'd in this which once unfolded might perhaps reconcile the difference  Hen  It cannot be but by the sword  Antonio  hear me if that the faith and friendship pledg'd to me want power to rouze you let your own interest  and honour that man whom you protect from my resentment has seconded his insolence to me by foul attempts upon  Honoria  's honour  Flo  I seek to wrong her honour the parent of your black designs and bitter enmity ne'er yet invented a more hellish salshood 'tis true I have lov'd the virtuous  Honoria  Ant  How sir  Flo  But with such spotless affection such pure devotion that she has recompenc'd my passion with esteem has chain'd me to her service and I will either live to call her mine or perish in her cause  Ant  Distractiondaggers to my heart  Hen  Oh has it rous'd you sir  Ant  Henriquez  pausemitigate your fury for a moment  Hen  I will notHis life or mine must pay the insolence  Ant  Hold or thro' me you

him escape  Ant  No by name and honour if I deal not in this business to your heart's wish and honour's credit my own life shall pay the forfeit  Juan  Consent  Henriquez  I beseech you  Ant  My heart is bleeding while I speakI am not us'd to sue let me conjure you by your hopes of bliss by all your dearest wishes by our propos'd union grant me this or here our friendship ceases and we meet no more  Hen  Delay is agony  Ant  I will not keep you long  Flo  What means  Antonio  Ant  Darest thou answer my demands  Flo  I can and justify myself thou traitor to thy friend  Ant  Lead to some other spot  Exit  Flo  and  Ant  Juan  This way good cousin  Hen  I will not long be dallied with these keen sensations will not leave my heart nor can my fury die  Exeunt  Enter  HONORIA FELICIA  and  ROSAGUZMAN  following  Hon  I am frighted to death  Fel  At all events let's follow and see the result  Rosa  Let me go first ladies and watch their motions I'll keep an excellent lookout and alarm you in case of extremity  Fel  Be it so then away  Exeunt  GUZMAN  alone  Guz  There will be mischief soonTherefore as my master has rudely left the ladies the least I can do is to keep with 'em and take care of 'em  Exit  Scene changes to the Hall of Don  JUAN  's House  Enter  FLORIO  and  ANTONIO  Flo  Give up my title I never will renounce  Honoria  Ant  You mustshe is so much mine that none must boast pretensions to her while I livein saving you from mad  Henriquez  ' sword I have discharg'd the engagement friendship made the injur'd husband now requires his dues  Flo  Spite of my wrongs I know not how to lift my sword against the breast of him who has given me such just such strong and such repeated reasons to admire and love him  Ant  It was  Florio  my comrade in arms my bosomfriend whom I design'd to serve not that disloyal man who has invaded my honour and my love  Flo  Mean treacherous artifice to do so gross an injury yourself then charge me as the wronger I swear by all those powers who both discern and punish I never knew that you pretended to  Henriquez  ' sister till since I came within these fatal walls  Ant  How am I to believe you can speak truth in this who have myself been witness of your falshood to her  Flor  I false to  Honoria  take heed  Antonio  so foul an injury I cannot brook  Ant  Rare confidence have I not myself assisted your feign'd passion and been witness of your faithless vows pledg'd to another  Flo  Another what mean device has bred so strange a charge but dars't thou talk of violated truth where are those ardent sacred and eternal vows pledg'd to an unknown fair with which at our first interview this night thou did'st abuse my credulous ear and taught my sympathising heart torn as it was with it's own griefs to throb with pangs for thee  Ant  Still written herebase man I cannot longer bear thy mean evasions either renounce all claim to  Honoria  or this must speak the rest  Flo  I'll be reduc'd to atoms ere I yield her  sight  Enter  HENRIQUEZ JUAN  and the rest  Hen  Ay this is wellhe shall not 'scape without some marks of my revenge  He attacks  Florio Antonio  turns in his Defence  Ant  Hold sir he shall not be o'erpower'd with numbers neither my honour you invade anew and wake my preengagement to protect him  Hen  Flames and the devil why were not you yourself doing your best to kill him  Ant  'Tis true but if he must fall he shall not be massacred by odds but conquer'd fairly like a man  Juan  For heaven's sake cease this violence I'll dye for't but some cursed error lies conceal'd that thus misleads us all  Hen  With my sword alone I'll search it out tho' multitudes oppos'd me  He attacks again  Rosa  peeping at the door cries out Ladies Ladies  Enter  HONORIA FELICIA  and  ROSA  running  Both  Hear us hear us  Hen  By heavens  Honoria  Juan  Why did not I tell you she was brought here by my direction  Hen  Oh thou vile woman that I cou'd destroy thy memory with thy life  He advances furiously towards  Honoria Antonio Juan  and  Florio  interpose  Ant  Hold siraltho' I do not know this lady I have this night engag'd my faith both to protect and serve her  Juan  See there he does not know  Honoria  Hen  Not know her why 'tis not an hour since I saw him entertaining her at my house death all we see is illusion and all we do inchantment  Fel  Suffer me Don  Henriquez  to unspel these charms  Antonio  which of us is it you pretend to  Ant  Which how can you ask you know too well the conquest which you made of my poor heart in Flanders  Juan  Conquest heart and Flanders what means that now  Hen  More riddles every moment  Fel  Your contract with  Honoria  then  Ant  Here I confirm itwhen I forego so dear a tye or wed another fair  Fel  Take heed for I am not  Honoria  Ant  Not  Honoria  Fel  No  Ant  Is't possible have I been only mock'd with visionary bliss and are my hopes thus blasted  Fel  All now depends on whatsoever turn  Henriquez'  temper takesObserve his conduct nor doubt of mine  Hon  Astonishment and disappointed fury seem to possess my brother's thoughts  Fel  I'll try to calm themKnow Don  Henriquez  that Don  Florio  has ever been your sister's constant lover his private visits at our house which have disturb'd your peace were by me calculated for their interview after you had refus'd her to his addressesmy heart was then entirely free 'tis now engag'dif I trespass too far on that reserve which is our sex's ornament and guard let the present exigence and my gratitude for signal services plead my excuse while I declare it is to that brave officer  Hen  Humph  Fel  This brother is that generous commander whose valiant arm restor'd our liberties and who engag'd himself the guardian of my honour  Juan  This that gallant leader to whom we are so much indebted  Fel  The same  Juan  Why did you not inform me sooner of so laudable a prepossession  Fel  My dear brother gratitude esteem and a thousand nameless passions so soon possess'd me I was asham'd of what you might have call'd a visionary love and durst not trust my own tongue with my thoughts  Flo  Your sister and this lady Don  Henriquez  both can witness I never had a thought to injure your happiness or honour Don  Pedro'  s death was occasion'd by your mistaken jealousy and you well know but that your self and your domesticks were the only witnesses of that transaction I had the fairest claim to the protection of the law having been surpris'd at disadvantage and oppress'd by numbers  All  How  Flo  Pedro  deserv'd his death and I am blameless  Hen  My shame my eternal shame what shall I say you see me overwhelm'd with confusion if I have acted in a manner unbecoming my name and honour attribute it to loveI seek not longer to conceal it a hurt a desperate jealous love for that ungrateful creature  Juan  Cousin I will now own I have perceiv'd it long and in justice to our friendship and alliance have even address'd my sister on the subject but found such insurmountable objections to your but  violence of temper that in consideration of what your pride might suffer I conceal'd my knowledge of your passion even from yourself  Fel  How cou'd a man of Don  Henriquez'  sense and penetration suppose his tyrannic treatment of so amiable a sister such everlasting doubts suspicions jealousies restrictions and severities must not disgust rather than win a woman's heart Cou'd you but have subdued those passions perhaps ere I had seen that gentleman I might have been induc'd to think of you in such a light as your person and natural endowments deserv'd if a disappointment herein be painful to your self alone you are indebted for it  Hen  Forbear I pray you shew not the happiness I might have reached nor add the weight of your reproaches to my selfcondemnation my punishment is sufficient without itI have justly railed when such a heart as mine concedes the pangs it suffers are not trivial  Fel  I am sorry and ask pardon  Hen  Yet to convince you that my sorrow is not selfish as I have been the source of general uneasiness I will endeavour to make a general amends let my own heart suffer what it may first madam may you enjoy more happiness if possible than I have wish'd to partake with you and sir to you unask'd I thus resign this contract which love and justice both forbid me now to claim  Ant  Noble  Henriquez  I thank and honour you  Juan  Sir take from me her hand whose heart your worth and bravery has merited  Ant  Thus I receive the sum of happiness this world can give and sir since you have generously resign'd the name of brother allow me that of friend which while I live I will deserve and suffer  me to entreat your concurrence for your sister's happiness where destiny seems to leadI will answer with my life my friend will merit her  Hen  Sir she is your'sand here dies all my animosity  Flo  We are now all your debtors I am peculiarly so  Hon  My brother now you are indeed my brother noble generous and kind you have set my heart at ease and I am myself again  Fel  That's more than I am I'm sure I have seen so many wonders I shan't be myself again this twelvemonth  Rosa  They have had a rare comeoff sure 'twou'd make a good plot for a play  Guz  That wou'd be bad for me for by the laws of comedy I should be oblig'd to marry you  Flo  Well thought of  Guzman  tho' spoke in jest you seem well fitted for each other and your faithful services deserve our general encouragement what say you  Rosa  Rosa  Sir I say I have had so many frights to night I am e'en afraid to lye alone  Guz  Thy hand sweet  Rosa  'tis a bargain if I dont repent first I don't care  Juan  This union being in my house let me entreat your stay to unite in woad'ring at these events and enjoying general congratulations cousin you will not refuse me  Hen  I will not be a means to thwart your mirth but endeavour as well as I am able to partake itmy heart has now a new a difficult and painful lesson set it but it must be learn'd for our adventures prove that womens mild and gentle hearts must be sooth'd by indulgence not frighted  by severity and that easy frank and confiding tempers bid fairest for a generous return  Since such and such alone deserve to share  The confidence and favour of the fair  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs MATTOCKS  AYaythey're at itin a dainty tew  "Have you the Epilogue""Not I" have you
