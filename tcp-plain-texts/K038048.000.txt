 HUMANITY  PRICE FIVE SHILLINGS  HUMANITY OR THE RIGHTS OF NATURE A POEM IN TWO BOOKS  BY THE AUTHOR OF  SYMPATHY  LONDON  PRINTED FOR T CADELL STRAND    PREFACE  THE Reader is requested to consider this Performance as a GENERAL OUTLINE with here and there some sketched features of a Work the nature of which is frequently alluded to in different parts of the Poem and the Title is specified on a separate leaf at the end  What I ventured abroad some years since under the title of SYMPATHYa poem which on account of the interests created in the Heart by the subject itself was received by the Public with so much generous warmthwas intended to serve as a Preliminary to what I had farther to observe on SOCIETY or a Prospect of the HUMAN RACE under the combined influences of CLIME and GOVERNMENT RELIGIONS LAWS and LIBERTIESFrom these the transition to TYRANNY was natural and strongly in connexion and from TYRANNY I felt myself called upon by all the awakened emotions of HUMANITY to consider SLAVERY but not only that species of it which consists in buying and selling our  FellowCreatures  in AfricaBUT EVERY OTHER KIND in EVERY OTHER PLACE Views therefore of FREEDOM and BONDAGE throughout the different parts of the globe have been taken as well from experience as the best historical evidence  In the order of my Poem on SOCIETY perhaps the part which relates to the Inhuman  Treatment  of Negroes for the  Treatment  appears to me more criminal than the  Traffic  might not have taken the lead not from any idea that these unhappy Beings are less entitled to the Rights of Nature or the Regulations of Society then any other parts of the HUMAN SPECIES but because according to the series I meant to observe the Prospect of the quarter of the Globe where this Trade principally subsists would have been out of time and place This objection being done away by the emulative Benevolence which is now excited in the Empire on this subject it affords me the greatest pleasure that by an  anticipation  of so much of what I had to remark on AFRICA as is confined to the Slave Trade which however by no means exhausts what remains  yet  to be said in that division of my future work I have a fair opportunity and at a seasonable moment to enforce the appeals of those who have the strongest claims on HUMANITY in a performance devoted to its  general  interests  How far the  entire Abolition  so warmly contended for by the supporters of this measure may be consistent with human policy it is not my purpose particularly to enquire It is not the  name  of Slave in  itself  which produces the great mischief An hired servant in Eu  ope may be as little at his own command and destined to as hard labour as a purchased Negro in Africa but the essential difference consists in the one being guarded by the laws of the land which spread before his person and his property a shield that defends him from every  abuse of power  and the other is left naked and defenceles to the "insolence of office"  HUMANITY requires that the RIGHTS OF NATURE should be enjoyed by every  Human Being  It is therefore against the shocking barbarity  I am glad however to have it in my power to observe that we have not suffered the HUMANITY of the French and other nations to surpass our own at least in  one  of our islands a  the following authentic extract from the Jamaica Councils will attest dated  November  th  "This day the House of Assembly went into a Committee on the Consolidated Slave Bill and continued sitting upwards of three hours we understand that by this Bill the whole system of the law respecting Negroes is entirely changed a Council of Protection is established in each parish and many humane provisions are introduced for rendering their condition easy and happy it is also made felony without benefit of clergy to murder a Slave a clause which to the great honour of the House passed without a single dissenting voice  the unquestionable cruelty and the too wellattested horror growing out of these that I contendAn abolition of  these enormities  is absolutely necessary For the rest whether the commerce flourishes or falls is a matter of no moment to the Philanthropist without engaging in the heats of political controversy without attending to the pleas of interest on the one side or the sallies of enthusiastic zeal though generous in its excesses on the other it is sufficient to Him that the happiness of the  species  in  general  is made independent on the tyranny of  particular individuals  that the laws of  subordination  in the different classes of SOCIETY should not violate the laws of  humanity  and that so much of  liberty  should be allowed to every man a  to feel a consciousness of his being a link in the great chain of the community and that till by some act of his own it is necessary for the  good of the whole  that he should be considered as an outcast of society he is by the Rights of nature and of Reason entitled to protection from insult misery and deathSo far as the  wealth  can be reconciled to the  happiness  of nations and the Establishments of Civil  Society  to the Rights of Nature  every lover of his country must subscribe at the fame time as the  wealth of worlds  cannot justify the least wanton infraction of the  laws of Humanity  whoever vainly attempts to support an argument for the one at the expence of the other erects a building which hath its foundation in the sands and which must tumble into ruins at the slightest touch of Reason and of Truth  Under this plain Conviction I have felt and written and shall continue to feel and write upon  Liberty  and  Slavery Humanity  and  Nature  and I now submit my Sentiments to the candid consideration of the Public without any undue considence of success or unmanly dread of miscarriageI have not thrust upon the world what I wish it to honour with notice without the previous approbation of some great and good minds but very contrary to the case with which in earlier life I used to reconcile myself to hasty publication were I not now to go to press till I was  satisfied with my own performance  those whose partiality disposes them to praise would blame me for unreasonable delay and those who are more prone to censure would no more be indebted to me for furnishing them with subject for the exercise of their favourite talent On every great and national occasion however our country has a claim on the best services we have to offer and wherever they fall short of our wishes or even of our own conceptions the proverbial apology that the  Intention sanctifies the Deed  ought to operate in our favour Should the deed in any measure do justice to the intentions in the  present  instance applause will not be withheld but it will only serve to animate my future exertions to prove more deserving of it  FOR THE ERATTA SEE LAST PAGE  HUMANITY  BOOK I  FROM vernal blooms and many a fragrant bow'r  The red'ning blossom and unfolding flower  From breezy mountains and the covert vale  The gliding water and the whispering gale  From gayer scenes where careless Fancy stray'd  Bask'd in the sun or frolick'd in the shade  Ambitious grown and touch'd by generous praise  Now turns the MUSE to more advent'rous lays  No more she paints the tints of blushing morn  Nor hangs the dewdrop on the trembling thorn  No more the brook runs murmuring in her line  No more fair Spring her florid verse is thine  Farewell a long farewell to founts and flow'rs  Far loftier themes demand her thoughtful powers  Where'er sublime SOCIETY expands  By art or nature form'd thy potent bands  Thro' realms of heat where faints th' expiring breeze  Or piercing climes where the sun seems to freeze  In darksome caverns on tremendous steeps  Th' embow'ring forest or the billowy deeps  Where roars the gulph or where the streamlets flow  Or dazzling mountains rise of endless snow  Soon shall she dare to wing the vast domain  THY awful power the subject of her strain  But ah first kneeling at Compassion's shrine  Her opening lay HUMANITY be thine  For thou her guardian patroness and guide  She owns with rapture and obeys with pride  Thee she invokes oh soother of distress  Who with our kindness wove our happiness  For as thy circling virtues round us move  From their best  deeds  thy brightest  joys  we prove  Oft as our neighbour sinks in sudden grief  Thou wak'st as sudden to afford relief  Oft as the stranger's bosom heaves with sighs  The soft responses in our bosoms rise  The cries of terror and the throes of care  The groan of misery and distraction's glare  Sickness that droops disease that gasps for breath  The howl of madness and the shrieks of death  Deep sounds of agony that most affright  Dread views of horror that most blast the sight  Dire as they are like wond'rous magnets draw  And own HUMANITY thy sacred law  And oh 'tis THINE when vital breath seems fled  To seek the awful confines of the dead  Drag the pale victim from the whelming wave  And snatch the body from the floating grave  Beneath the billow tho' entomb'd it lies  Thy dauntless zeal the roaring main defies  Inspir'd by HIM whose hallow'd touch restor'd  The darling babe the widow's soul deplor'd  Her matron bosom eas'd of dire alarms  And gave the child to her despairing arms  'Tis THINE to plunge into the bloating flood  Clasp the swol'n frame and thaw the frozen blood  Breathe in the lips reanimating fire  Till warm'd to SECOND LIFE the DROWN'D respire  Hark as those lips once more begin to move  What sounds ascend of gratitude and love  Now with the GREAT REDEEMER's praise they glow  Then bless the  Promoters of that glorious Institution the HUMANE SOCIETY  agents of his power below  New sprung to life the renovated band  Joyful before their second Saviours stand  And oh far sweeter than the breathing spring  Fairer than Paradise the wreaths they bring  The blissful homage rescu'd friends impart  Th' enraptur'd incense of a parent's heart  Oe'raw'd and wond'ring at themselves they see  And feel the power of soft HUMANITY  When sovereign Reason from her throne is hurl'd  And with her all the subject senses whirl'd  From sweet HUMANITY the nurse of grief  Even  thy  deep woes O PHRENZY find relief  For tho' the tresses loose and bosom bare  And maniac glance thy hapless state declare  With gentle hand  she  still supports thy head  Beguiles thy wand'ring wit and smoothes thy bed  Assists thy roving fancy in its flight  To crown thy airy sallies with delight  An healing balm to thy warp'd sense she brings  Till from her softness magic comfort springs  And joys which reason with a frown denies  Her tender pity with a smile supplies  Ev'n in thy prisonhouse she bids thee draw  From the rush sceptre and the crown of straw  The mimic truncheon and the loveknot true  Full many a transport Reason never knew  And at thy grated cell she oft appears  She culls thee flowers and bathes them with her tears  The perfum'd violet and the blooming rose  On thy hurt mind a transient bliss bestows  Into a thousand shapes the garlands change  As fairy fancy takes its antic range  Then as thy brows the fragrant wreaths adorn  The roses seem to bloom without a thorn  Yet not to  woes  confin'd for pleasure's song  The reckless frolics of the village throng  Ev'n as we pass them by in distant lands  THOU mak'st our own and oft we join the bands  The sudden sounds of happiness we hail  And swell the chorus echoing in the gale  Gladly we pause then blythe pursue our way  While brighter sunshine seems to gild the day  For from the jovial groupe as we depart  THY richer sunshine beams upon the heart  Thus bliss is doubled and thus pain can warm  From thee HUMANITY both boast a charm  We chear are chear'd now grant and now receive  And need in turn the comfort which we give  Thus thy fair streams spread plenty where they run  Yet bless the fountains whence those streams begun  Like the rich NILE thy sources ne'er are dry  Although a thousand channels they supply  But Thou from whom these bosom'd comforts flow  HUMANITY thou friend to joy and woe  Hast still ordain'd that grief to crimes belong  And that keen anguish shall attend on wrong  Pride hate revenge and tyranny and strife  As they mix poisons in the bowl of life  Dash their  own  cup and impotently try  To break  unpunish'd  nature's  social tie  Good is of good productive ill of ill  Conscience o'er both exerts her empire still  And this great truth shall ev'ry tyrant know  THE WOE HE GIVES SHALL BE REPAID BY WOE  Is there a land where echoing Fame extends  From her proud cliff to earth's remotest ends  Where gently slop'd the teeming vales are seen  Adorn'd like Eden's with eternal green  Where ev'ry village glows with every wealth  The showers are riches and the breezes health  Where the sun gives serene his temper'd ray  But never scourges with excessive day  Where female beauty sheds her fairest blooms  And lovliest feature loveliest grace assumes  Darts strongest magic from the potent eye  Breaks in the blush and shoots along the sigh  Where ev'ry scene is prodigal of charms  True courage kindles and true glory warms  Where brave resistance lifts the conquering arm  And social blessings lend their softest charm  Where rear'd to Virtue Christian temples tow'r  And melting Charity chastises pow'r  Conducts the naked stranger to her dome  And grants the houseless wanderer an home  Where equal laws such genial mildness shew  They beam sweet mercy on a captive foe  O native Britons here assert your claim  Boast of your ISLE and justify her fame  Tell how her youth by sacred science led  To all the soft'ning charities are bred  How second childhood like the first receives  From  her  the cradle which compassion gives  Tell how her palaces of mercy rise  Large tho' the wants still larger the supplies  How her kind  Vide his Bill for the Relief of the Poor  GILBERT frames protective laws  A faithful champion in the poor man's cause  How even now intent on godlike deeds  Thy wants and woes O POVERTY he pleads  Earnest thy oftinvaded rights to spare  From the hard hand that would thy pittance tear  E'en from thy lip nor heed thy teardimm'd eye  Thy spectre form and pitymoving cry  Tell how her  This Lady is Author of a Benevolent Project on the same Subject  BIRCH whose heart is form'd to bless  The sad to succour and the wrong'd redress  The ravish'd morsel of the poor to save  The work to crown her warm assistance gave  Tell how her  The excellent Translator of ESCHYLUS EURIPIDES and now of SOPHOCLES took an active Part in instituting and regulating an House of Industry in his own County  POTTER aids the generous plan  As bard her pride her nobler boast as man  Tell how her HOWARD's sympathizing soul  Extends the Saviourarm from pole to pole  Crutch to the lame and vision to the blind  Tell how she sooths the ills that scourge mankind  All this proclaim till nations bless the zone  And happy Albion marks it for her own  Just is the boast yet why to  home  confin'd  Are the soft mercies of thy Albion's mind  Why at her bidding rolls the crimson flood  To deluge AFRIC in her children's blood  Why torn from Sire from children and from wife  Dragg'd at her wheels are captives chain'd for life  And why do hecatombs each day expire  Smote by her mangling whip and murderous fire  Those stripes those yielding shrieks that rend the air  Ill fated AFRICA thy wrongs declare  Blush Britain blush for thou 'tis thou hast sold  A richer gem than India's mines can hold  Traffic'd thy soft HUMANITY away  And turn'd her strongest objects into prey  Thy generous sons upon that fatal shore  Their nature lose and harden into ore  There  greedy avarice rears his venal throne  'Midst seas of blood that float the sultry zone  With wiry lash and iron rod he sways  The tyrant orders and the slave obeys  Havoc and horror rage at his command  And dissolution covers all the land  O that my Muse could mount on Nature's wing  Soar like her "darling" her lov'd Shakespeare sing  Then ev'ry word should "harrow up the soul"  And Afric's wrongs resound from pole to pole  Thrice humble HOWARD ah do  thou  inspire  And breath thy Godlike spirit in my lyre  For all accustom'd as thou art to see  The direst scenes of human misery  To go where nature scourges with disease  "  The lines with inverted commas are from the Triumph of Benevolence written by the author of this Poem in honour of Howard  And spotted deaths load ev'ry tainted breeze  Where ev'n the strong Antipathies assail  Haunts of the filthfed toad and slimy snail  The noxious caverns and abhorrent caves  Where wretches pace alive around their graves  While hollow echoes ring their endless knells  Thro' deepscoop'd vaults and slowconsuming cells"  Ne'er did thy eyes such marks of horror trace  As hourly agonize the  Negro race  Prove then the prisoner and the mourner's friend  And once again thy virtuous influence lend  "So raptur'd notes as if by Angles giv'n  Once more shall peal the harmonies of Heaven"  Again the virtues that revere thy name  Wide o'er the realm shall spread th' ingenuous flame  Pity's high priest the righteous cause shall plead  And shouts of joy to cries of blood succed  HOWARDS unnumber'd shall the truth embrace  "And feel akin to  all  the human race  Again shall Avarice suspend his art  And feel again subdu'd his rugged heart  His bosom loosen'd from the sullen ore  The rock shall gush in blessings to the poor  Wouldst thou the map of slavery survey  And the dire circuit of the trade display  Dart thy astonish'd eye o'er distant lands  From Senegal to Gambia's burning sands  Pursue the blushing lines to Congo's shore  Then traverse many a league Benguela o'er  Career immense o'er which the merchant reigns  And drags reluctant MILLIONS in his chains  COMMERCE thou sailest on a sanguine flood  On a red sea of Man's devoted blood  Thy pompous robe tho' gemm'd as India's store  Proud tho' it flows is dy'd in human gore  The tears of millions bathe thy fatal cane  And half thy treasure springs from human pain  And not an idol on thy altars shine  But human victims stain the crimson shrine  And thou O INT'REST dark insidious power  Whose sanction'd arts waste nations in an hour  Whose mining frauds more fatal still destroy  Hope's tender blossom and the fruits of joy  Thou to whom all the coward slights belong  Thy heart too cruel for a generous wrong  For fierce Revenge that fever of the soul  Hate that defies and Love that spurns controul  Or mad'ning Jealousy when Reason bends  Or Zeal extravagant to liberal ends  Thou who for noble faults like these too cold  Whose vices n'er aspire but stoop to gold  That groveling passion of the sordid breast  Like Aaron's serpent swallowing up the rest  Theft rapine plunder fraud and murder stand  Fell ministers to wait thy dire command  Yes thou the founder of this impious trade  Mad'st  him  a slave that nature never made  Tore the poor Indian from his native soil  And chain'd him down to neverending toil  Ah luscious mischief slavecreating CANE  Of ev'ry soft HUMANITY the bane  Thy venom'd sweet whose soulpolluting art  Like some mask'd poison eats into the heart  Sweet tho' thou art an aspic sting is thine  And into shambles  Christians  turn thy shrine  Thou like vile  Gold  from the embowel'd earth  By avarice dragg'd reluctantly to birth  To taste thy charm are groaning nations bound  And half mankind in kindred blood are drown'd  Say MUSE from whence th' unnatural mart began  The sordid merchandise and sale of man  From Egypt first the Ethiop traffic came  But dawn'd so mild that slavery was not shame  While nature yet preserv'd some generous right  The yoke was easy and the burthen light  And here the  patriarch law  each wrong restrain'd  And "eye for eye and tooth for tooth" ordain'd  Soon o'er th' Aegean waves the trade was brought  Travell'd to GREEce till ROME th' infection caught  Yet temperate still no tyranny arose  Till baneful LUXURY marshall'd all her woes  Conquerors their captives with a smile receiv'd  And whom the brave embrac'd they ne'er deceiv'd  The battle o'er they bade contention cease  And foes in war were humble friends in peace  The pledge was solemn and the vow sincere  The union sacred and the compact dear  But oh fair ATHENS when the commerce drew  To thy lov'd shore the bonds yet gentler grew  The slave could boast a guardian in thy laws  And summon justice to support his cause  Ev'n to thy holy altars might repair  Assert his claims and find them honour'd there  In rosy fetters were thy pris'ners bound  And in captivity with freedom crown'd  Wisdom in peace or valour in the war  The faithful counsel or the glorious scar  Attachment prov'd and servitude sustain'd  With manly zeal their liberty regain'd  With his own hand the master loos'd the yoke  But the slave scarce perceiv'd the bonds were broke  So soft the texture he ne'er felt their weight  Nor chang'd his master tho' he chang'd his state  Captive no more he still pursu'd his toil  And grateful vow'd allegiance to the soil  Yes classic ATHENS nurse of generous arts  Thine was the throb HUMANITY imparts  To freemen rose thy slaves and then aspir'd  To all thy sons to all thy state requir'd  Ev'n to Athenian loyalty they grew  Till scarce thy citizens a difference knew  While shameless SPARTA butcher'd half her slaves  Convulsive shook and dug untimely graves  Despis'd abhor'd and dreaded was their sway  To all a tyrant's guilt and fears a prey  Thou too lost ROME how galling was thy chain  In those dire times when mercy su'd in vain  When cut to atoms was the debtor's heart  That each hard creditor might claim his part  And oh degraded GREECE how fall'n thy state  Once like thy splendid rival wise and great  Nor less her rival in thy vices found  Both soaring now now sinking to the ground  How dimm'd thy orb when  Sages  could ordain  The sanguine whip and vindicate the chain  When thy grave PLUTARCH wise discreet and brave  Stern in philosophy could stab his slave  And thy DEMOSTHENES in thunders urge  The sovereign virtues of the mangling scourge  O blind to think where smiles and kindness fail  To touch the soul that frowns and stripes prevail  Hail tender ADRIAN first on Rome's record  Who drew distinct the line 'twixt slave and lord  Who with sweet mercy temper'd awful power  While pity's angel hail'd th' auspicious hour  Thou Christian emperor in whose generous breast  The light of pure devotion shone impress'd  That sacred light descending from above  An emanation of coelestial love  With speed of light'ning spread the lambent ray  Till realms of darkness kindled into day  From God himself the spark etherial came  And man ador'd the soulilluming flame  Thou too just CONSTANTINE with gentle sway  Bade all be free and all that God obey  The fire from Heav'n a general lustre shed  And the foul mists of superstition fled  Fair Faith was crown'd her banner was displayed  Sunk was the crosier and the cross prevail'd  But ah once more to stain the bloody shrine  And sell mankind O PORTUGAL was thine  To thee illfated Afric owes her pain  The scourge fresh pointed and the new forg'd chain  Thine the base arts the sons of gold applaud  The smile deceptive and the snare of fraud  Th' extended hand that chases fear away  Th' embrace that wins affection to betray  The league of peace in policy devis'd  The compact broken and the oath despis'd  To lure the heart all smooth seductions try'd  And the heart gain'd disguise's thrown aside  The plot avow'd the promise boldly broke  By the harsh driver and the galling yoke  Accurs'd GONZALES taught thee first the art  To six this stigma on his country's heart  The dire example spread with barbarous rage  Thrift was the vice and spar'd nor sex nor age  At length the traffic into  system  came  Th' infection flew till Britain caught the flame  Detested HAWKINS arm'd his pirate host  And wolfelike prowl'd on Guinea's fated coast  Force brib'ry stratagem were all employ'd  O shame till twice ten millions were destroy'd  The work of Christians this whose lawless rage  Taught milder savages foul wars to wage  Christians taught savages new modes of strife  And burst asunder all the ties of life  Christians taught savages to worship gold  Till for their idol sons and sires were sold  Till sleeping tribes at midnight's hour were caught  And seiz'd as prey to  public market  brought  Till from the breast the babe was stol'n away  And children kidnapp'd in the face of day  Next tawny SPAIN the shameful trade pursu'd  Theft grew familiar tyranny ensued  The tawny slave on his oppressor pour'd  And mad with smart his haughty lord devour'd  Insidious SPAIN still vanity thy guide  Thou mixture loath'd of penury and pride  Slothful in dignity supine in state  Active alone in cruelty and hate  Commerce like this might well command thy zeal  O patron of the agonizing wheel  From where wild Biscay throws its foam around  And aids the deaf'ning tempests frantic sound  Ev'n to the steeps where Pyrenees ascend  And like a rocky chain their links extend  The nations shuddered as it sprang to birth  And throes unwonted shook the lab'ring earth  Thou TORQUEMADA thy assistance gave  To fix this engine which the thoughts enslave  Sedately savage thou could'st calm behold  Men scatter'd piecemeal tho' thy rage was cold  Quaff'd the warm blood enforc'd the torturing power  And view'd with horrid joy the flames devour  School'd in thy climes demoniac arts could bear  To see the cord inflict the pincers tear  Array'd thy victims in the rich attire  And danc'd like Satan round thy feast of fire  Ah well might SLAVERY thrive in such a hand  For all are slaves in a despotic land  Precarious life is pass'd in trembling awe  And the proud tyrant owns the breath they draw  POWER like a miser spreads the greedy hand  Still stepping onward never at a stand  A subtle miner working still his way  In av'rice of accumulating sway  Tools would be statesmen statesmen would be kings  And  they  would mount upon the angels wings  POWER first advances with a modest air  But born a tyrant quickly learns to dare  By due degrees he throws each barrier down  Thinks  strength  is  right  and calls the world his own  At length grown absolute assumes the God  And proves at once a pestilence and rod  Till grown incautious some rash point he tries  And in the ruin of his project lies  Behold where fated FLORIDA extends  His bloodtrack'd course the fell VELASQUEZ bends  Launches his guilty bark upon the waves  To kidnap freeborn men and make them slaves  See as he gains the chaindevoted land  The sable natives hurry to the strand  His sailing castle on the waves they view  And gaz'd with wonder as it near them drew  But on the deck when  human  forms appear'd  And peaceful signals smil'd no more they fear'd  'Twas MAN they trusted MAN who spoke them fair  Cajol'd their faith and lur'd them to the snare  And now as guests they land as guests are led  Thro' palmy groves to every Indian shed  The Spaniards there their glitt'ring stores unfold  The shining mirrour and the toy of gold  Each gaudy bauble cheats the Indian's eyes  And tricks his passions into fond surprize  Teaches new luxuries and wants unknown  Till Europe's vice and folly is his own  The useless ornaments his senses fire  And each fresh gewgaw kindles fresh desire  Fair in the glass another self he sees  Till harmless wonder swells to vanities  From lures like these the baneful passions grow  And what began in pleasure ends in woe  Frauds heap'd on frauds to purchase these were taught  And every trinket was with bloodshed bought  But soon as guests in turn the Indian bands  Condemn'd alas to quit their native lands  No fraud suspecting mount the treacherous ship  Where as in ambush lie the chains and whip  Like nested snakes whose poisons are enroll'd  Mid'st wreaths of flowers in many a shining fold  The faithless Spaniard leaves the plunder'd shore  His fraud succeeds and freedom is no more  Then o'er th' affrighted waves is heard the yell  Of mingled thousands in their wat'ry Hell  Shut from the light unknowing yet their doom  The vessel proves a prison and a tomb  In the dark caverns of the bark they lie  Live to fresh horrors or in bondage die  While the base tyrant glorying in his snare  Mocks at the loud rebuke and dumb despair  Soon as the vessel bore the tribes away  What horrors seiz'd upon the trembling prey  Ah hear the shrieks of kindred left behind  Roll to the wave and gather in the wind  Matrons with orphans sons with sires appear  But vain affection's shriek and nature's tear  The Spainsh pirate ploughs the watr'y plains  And plants his cannon at the thin remains  The flaming balls the wailing natives reach  And added slaughter stains the crimson beach  All all is lost but with a generous pride  E'en slaves spurn life when freedom is deny'd  "Free still be free loud echoes to the sky  Dare not to live in bondage dare to die"  But oh ye Christian savages declare  On what unknown prerogative ye dare  Peaceful and blest where rich Bananas grew  And nature freshen'd as the seabreeze blew  Where harvests smil'd without the aid of toil  And verdure gladden'd the exuberant soil  Where summer held so bountiful a sway  Scarce claim'd their year the culture of a day  The plants at twilight trusted to the earth  The following morn sprang blooming into birth  Grac'd with the bow the Indians harmless ran  And undisturb'd enjoy'd the rights of man  The rights of man by nature still are due  To men of ev'ry clime and every hue  Their arrows sought the monsters of the wood  The chase at once their pastime and their food  Bower'd by th' umbrageous vine they thought no wrong  Now wreath'd the dance and carol'd now the song  And oft some sable mistress of the soul  Prepar'd the banquet and partook the bowl  Shar'd every bliss that genuine nature gave  And often own'd the vanquish'd heart a slave  The willing captive wore fair beauty's chain  And pleas'd submitted to the tender pain  If giant POWER confers this wanton sway  Subdues the strong and makes the weak obey  Does power give RIGHT beware that dangerous plea  Perchance its tendency thou do'st not see  The slave once stronger than thyself shall stand  And seize intripid on thy stern command  Arm'd with thy iron sceptre bid thee toil  Scar thy white skin and chain thee to the soil  Thy spirit fainting in the glare of day  Shall bid thee naked brave the torrid ray  Retort thy scorn retaliate all thy rage  Wear out thy youth and murder thee in age  Tear from thy fetter'd arms thy child and wife  And blast the budding promises of life  Repay in turn each stroke thy baseness gave  And make thee feel what 'tis to be a slave  Ah false as fatal to the Weak and Strong  Th'inherent rights of nature still belong  No partial principles the just impel  To thinking wisely or to acting well  For liberty of all mankind the cause  Becomes a forfeit  only  to the laws  Those sacred compacts which like links sustain  Connecting parts of the great social chain  And while with these no member is at strife  As full the right to liberty as life  Alike the boon of heav'n and never ends  From sire to son from son to sire descends  Avaunt assertors of  superior  right  And vain distinctions betwixt  black  and  white  Firm and immovable on nature's base  Stands the grand charter of the human race  For HE who gave us life bade life be free  And to enhance his gift sent Liberty  Then  whence  this wond'rous difference in our race  Come crested Pride and the distinction trace  Lo from th' Equator to the northern pole  Tho' colours change unchangeable the soul  If justly bought the man of  deepest  die  By equal laws the  next in shade  we buy  So soft'ning on till scarce a tint between  The haughty lord and humble slave is seen  Springs the vain boast from thy superior WHITE  Vain prepossession of thy partial sight  Beware fallacious reas'ner lest the North  His  whiter  rival sends indignant forth  Ah rather blushing hide thy snowy skin  For know thy slave paints white the sire of  sin  And darker than  himself  he draws the POW'R  Which as his sovereign  good  his race adore  Thy cruelty has taught him to despise  Like hell  thy  hue his  own  like heav'n to prize  NATURE and HABIT human kind controul  The needle one and one th' attractive pole  And what in Europe we a grace may call  Is found in Africa no grace at all  And what abhorr'd deformity we name  In many a climate dignifies with fame  Survey the various globe from shore to shore  Weigh MANNERS CUSTOMS and be proud no more  Thou who would'st fix her to the palest face  See how for these ev'n BEAUTY shifts her place  All all to nature or opinion bow  Or fond caprices which from habit flow  Here BEAUTY proudly boasts the length'ning head  There on the shoulders bids it broadly spread  Here sma  lest gems must grace the fair one's ear  And there the pendents large as logs appear  Here see her ask the locks of snowy white  Yet beg the charm of teeth more dark than night  Here must the broaden'd eyebrow shade the face  There softly curv'd must crescent archings grace  While here those crescent archings must depart  Stubb'd from the root for painted brows of art  Here BEAUTY loves the cheek supremely fair  There boasts the gash and cherishes the scar  In Britain rose and lilly must unite  While Damian's Isthmus claims the milky white  The beard must here e'en to the girdle flow  There not a bristle must presume to grow  Here the swoll'n body there the slender waist  This wrap'd in silk and that in dogskin grac'd  Here BEAUTY triumphs in her wooly hair  But waves in wreaths her auburn tresses there  To grace the dames of Europe fair they flow  Long and profuse upon a neck of snow  In ev'ry curl a Cupid seems to lie  To aid the conquests of the sparkling eye  The thickest lip here beauty makes her care  More softly swell'd like dewy rosebuds there  The dazzling white is in this clime admir'd  In that the glossy black is more desir'd  Feel humbly then nor deem all grace thy own  Nor think that  Nature  charms in thee alone  The poorest native of the poorest coast  Hath still his beauty still his good to boast  From earth's beginning to its utmost ends  Proportion'd charm proportion'd bliss she sends  Exact division but adapted still  To what in different climes her children feel  To what when undebauch'd by man's desires  Or fancied wants necessity requires  Nor sparing nor yet prodigal her plan  With pois'd equality she blesses man  On the worst soil some heartfelt joy bestows  Which the glad son she there has station'd knows  And what from us extorts the taunting sneer  May to his sense an happiness appear  As the fond gifts which we indulgent deem  To him an aggravated curse may seem  Thus kind is nature in her zone serene  But not more kind than in her torrid scene  Not less a parent where the frozen Power  Resides for centuries in his icy tower  Where the hoar monarch in his vest of snow  Ascends the hills where suns refuse to glow  Vain all dispute of colour form or size  In pride in reas'ning pride our error lies  POPE  In pride in pride alone the difference lies  Whence then presumpt'ous man proceeds thy right  And by what law does olive yield to white  Why has not brown black copper equal claim  Their nature origin and end the same  All of one species all of equal birth  Tho' shifting colours like their parent earth  If not in  colour  then perchance in  sense  In the  soul  's power may lie the proud pretence  Ah no from Nature's hand all equal came  Thro' ev'ry clime an helpless babe's the same  The same frail emblem of our state appears  A weak and helpless being born in tears  If cultur'd climes refine on nature's plan  They change the mode but never change the man  The human passions strongly are impress'd  In the untutor'd as the polish'd breast  In the swarth African that's bought and sold  As the fair plunderer that steals his gold  Heav'n form'd his eyes to love his native hue  And pointed all his appetites as true  Those sable tints at which with fear we start  Are the lov'd colours that attract his heart  Our polish'd arts refinement may bestow  But oft enfeeble nature's genuine glow  In polish'd arts unnumber'd virtues lie  But ah unnumber'd vices they supply  Here if they bloom with ev'ry gentler good  There are they steep'd with more than savage blood  Here with Refinement if sweet Pity stands  There Luxury round them musters all her bands  'Tis not enough that daily slaughter feeds  That the fish leaves its stream the lamb its meads  That the reluctant ox is dragg'd along  And the bird ravish'd from its tender song  That in reward of all her music giv'n  The lark is murder'd as she soars to Heav'n  'Tis not enough our appetites require  That on their altars hecatombs expire  But cruel man a savage in his power  Must heap fresh horrors on life's parting hour  Full many a being that bestows its breath  Must prove the pang that waits a  ling'ring  death  Here close pent up must gorge unwholesome food  There render drop by drop the smoaking blood  The quiv'ring flesh improves as slow it dies  And Lux'ry sees th' augmented whiteness rise  Some creatures gash'd must feel the torturer's art  Writhe in their wounds tho' sav'd each vital part  From the hard bruise the food more tender grows  And callous Lux'ry triumphs in the blows  Some yet alive to raging flames consign'd  By piercing shrieks must sooth our taste refin'd  O power of mercy that suspends the rod  O shame to man impiety to God  Thou polish'd Christian in th' untutor'd see  The sacred rights of sweet HUMANITY  Thine is the World thy crimson spoils enjoy  But let no  wanton  arts thy soul employ  Live tho' thou do'st on blood ah still refrain  To load thy victims with  superfluous  pain  Ev'n the gaunt tyger tho' no life he saves  In generous  haste  devours what famine craves  The bestial paw may check thy human hands  And teach  dispatch  to what thy want demands  Abridge thy sacrifice and bid thy knife  FOR HUNGER KILL BUT NEVER SPORT WITH LIFE  Relief appears as the Muse shifts her place  To where pure manners bless the gentlest race  Lo where the BRAMINS pass their blameless life  Free from proud culture free from polish'd strife  To man brute insect nature's constant friends  The heart embraces and the hands extends  See the meek tribe refuse the worm to kill  No murder feeds them and no blood they spill  But crop the living herbage as it grows  And quaff the living water as it flows  From the full herds the milky banquet bear  And the kind herds repay with pastures fair  From sanguine man they drive the game away  From sanguine man they save the sinny prey  The copious grain they scatter o'er the mead  The bird to nourish and the beast to feed  The flowers their couch their roof the arching trees  And peaceful nights succeed to days of ease  O thou proud Christian aid fair nature's grace  And catch compassion from the Bramin race  Their kind extremes and vegetable fare  Their tender maxims all that breathe to spare  Suit not thy cultur'd state but  all  should know  Like them to save unnecessary woe  Like them to give each generous feeling birth  And prove the  friends  not  tyrants  of the earth  O sweet HUMANITY might pity sway  All all like Bramins would thy voice obey  For ah to heighten joy and solace woe  All need alas thy tender aid below  One leans on all for help not all on one  What worm so feeble as proud man alone  The veriest giant by himself is found  Frail as the reed that every breeze can wound  But even the pigmy with associates join'd  Strong as the oak can brave the rudest wind  The SOCIAL PASSION opens with our breath  Pursues thro' life and follows us to death  See as yon infant lull'd in slumber lies  How the fond mother to its cradle flies  Soft on her faithful breast reclines its head  Her faithful breast its banquet and its bed  Tho' many a suffering for its sake she bore  They all but serve to make her love it more  For soon a  kindred  passion  equal  burns  The parent's tenderness the child returns  Runs by her side or struggles to her knee  And owns the touch of fair HUMANITY  The child arrived at man the parent lies  Sick'ning at life in haste her offspring flies  Explores the chamber tho' disease be there  And hangs with catching deaths the putrid air  And when at length the mother yields to fate  Stretch'd round her breathless form the affections wait  In mute distress and with uplifted hands  The child she cradled at her coffin stands  Invokes her spirit to assuage the woe  And teach meek patience to endure the blow  Blesses the holy shade which gave him birth  Moves to the grave and views the opening earth  A filial shudder thro' his frame he proves  As the dust falls upon the dust he loves  Then as the time steals on with  thieflike  power  And brings to  him  the allsubduing hour  Himself  e're this a parent soon shall prove  The soft'ning offices of  filial  love  For those who owe  him  life shall weeping bend  And his attracting couch as fondly tend  Watch his dim'd eye observe his changing cheek  And drink his dying breath to hear him speak  His latest accents in their hearts enshrine  As sainted sounds of oracles divine  Thus shall he  feel  the tenderness he  gave  And equal tears fall fast upon his grave  Tyrants o'er brutes with ease extend the plan  And rise in cruelty from beast to man  Their sordid policy each crime allows  The flesh that quivers and the blood that flows  The furious stripes that murder in a day  Or torturing arts that kill by dire delay  The fainting spirit and the bursting vein  All all are reconcil'd to Christian gain  In cold barbarian apathy behold  Sits the slaveagent bending o'er his gold  That base contractor for the chain and rod  Who buys and sells the image of his God  Callous to ev'ry touch that nature lends  The bond that ties him to his kind he rends  Robber at once and butcher of his slaves  Nor grief nor sickness age nor sex he saves  But plung'd in traffic coldly can debate  The parent's destiny the infant's fate  The teeming mother of her hope despoil  And poise the gains of childbirth or of toil  The sighs and groans which spring from both he spurns  For life or death 'tis gold the balance turns  O Pride and Avarice of deluded fools  Despotic maxims taught in foreign schools  Where still the science of a slave is taught  To check the growth of every generous thought  Where one proud mortal owns the subjects breath  Whispers are treason and a word is death  Tenets like these to polish'd France belong  For all she licenses is dance and song  The hands are fetter'd tho' the feet are free  And clos'd the lips in dread of tyranny  The poor proud subject still is idly gay  Skips off his thoughts and hums his cares away  As the cag'd bird tho' pris'ner till it die  Will sometimes sing altho' it may not fly  Thy tree O LIBERTY forbid to taste  A Frenchman's richest genius runs to waste  Oft are the seeds of freedom in his soul  But none can spring amid such hard controul  In life's fresh morn if chance they dare to shoot  The bud scarce peeps e'er Power destroys the root  Nothing can prosper in a slavish soil  Save stinted shrubs unworthy of the toil  Like pallid sweets of ineffectual May  That faintly bloom and wither in a day  Not so the plants which LIBERTY bestows  That in our Albion's favor'd garden grows  There lifts the oak its top into the skies  While with glad heart the Briton sees it rise  Uninjur'd there for ages shall it stand  Nor ever quit it but to guard the land  Then on the deep in gallant pomp it moves  To serve that freedom which its country loves  Oh ever sail fair Bark upon thy waves  Still guard thy England from a realm of slaves  Oh ever flow fair Sea to guide our coast  Still to divide us from yon abject host  And swell ye Cliffs that canopy our strand  To frown indignant on that servile land  That land of mutes of one proud Lord the prey  A clime where to be dumb is to obey  Unheard unseen where wretches meet their dooms  For whom no tear must ever bathe their tombs  Conceal'd the parent's pangs the lover's sighs  Bastiles for ever frown before their eyes  Like those they mourn down precipices thrown  Are all that dare the ties of nature own  Buried alive from youth to age they lie  And ev'n at last in agonies they die  Oh hail'd by men and angels be the hour  Which clipp'd ev'n Britons wing outstretch'd for power  Which taught the monarch where his rights should end  And to what point the subjects should extend  Bade the encroacher know his proper sphere  Or for each wrong the meanest subject fear  Once Kings controul'd the law in infant times  Plunder'd at will nor answer'd for their crimes  Our juster system snaps the tyrant's chains  Curbs his proud nature and his rage restrains  Mark by what gradual steps Britannia rose  As the small acorn to a forest grows  By what variety of adverse fate  Terrors of war and anarchies of state  What direful griefs by foreign fury bred  Rivers of blood and mountains of the dead  She past advent'rous e're her wrongs were o'er  Complete her triumphs and confirm'd her pow'r  When but to look was treason to the state  And the King's nod like thund'ring Jove's was fate  Not now as in our scribbling James's days  Plain truth is tortur'd in the statesman's maze  Then 'twas that thus the royal nonsense run  Our word is law who murmurs is undone  Behold the painted natives of the isle  Rough as the coast uncultur'd as the soil  Halfnaked and halfcover'd see them go  For sport or war accouter'd with the bow  The plumy helmet nodding on the head  And the loose skin across the shoulders spread  A rude SOCIETY without a plan  Above the brute yet scarce arriv'd at man  But even  here  was felt the patriot flame  And from these sparks our noontide radiance came  To guard the huts that stretch along the strand  Arm'd with the scythe and wicker shield they stand  The chariot mount or leap upon the ground  And shout victorious to the trumpet's sound  Chains wounds and death the hardy chiefs defy  For Britain conquer or for Britain die  The brave CARACTACUS his squadrons brought  And with inferior force undaunted fought  Tho' rude the race and savage tho' the scene  Freedom call'd forth Iceni's warlike queen  A martial band great BOADICIA led  And ev'n a woman for her country bled  Revenge and liberty inspir'd the fair  And poison sav'd her in the last despair  This from ignoble bondage set her free  And all the shame of ROMAN slavery  Thus in the earliest hour of Britains morn  A Briton's haste of tyrrany was born  Abhorrence sacred to repel the hand  That dares to wrong the charter of the land  Our sturdy ancestors tho' oft subdu'd  But breath'd from war and strait the charge renew'd  Now dress'd as victims now as prisoners bound  The blood of heroes deluging the ground  In each extreme our brave forefathers prove  Their native courage and their country's love  Fierce for hereditary claims they fight  And ev'n till death maintains a Briton's right  Hence rose  our  liberties a common cause  To these succeed their best support the Laws  Bonds conflicts murders massacres ensu'd  And many a Saxon Danish sword embrued  In English blood and many a monarch's life  And many a Monk's submitted to the strife  Eer Laws were form'd as now sublime they stand  The shield the spear and buckler of the land  At length bloom'd forth diffusing all their charms  The arts of peace more strong than those of arms  Barbaric Ignorance resin'd away  Like mists dispersing at the dawn of day  The sword hung up the trumpet heard no more  The Lyre essay'd its humanizing power  Religion came with meekness to explode  The heathen idol and the Saxon God  In place of Deities with frowns pourtray'd  Mild Christianity in smiles array'd  Where stood the claybuilt hut see cities rise  Where altar's blaz'd with human sacrifice  Where pagan superstition horror spread  And even where Piety misguided led  In later times her victims to the flame  In bloody mem'ry of our Mary's name  Now  see our country share an happier fate  Discreetly strong and equitably great  Her power supreme and yet her reason clear  In skilful balance holding hope and fear  Her force lawgovern'd knows its proper fence  Distinct from tyrrany and impotence  Not fierce to punish nor so weak to spare  When truth acquires but justice still her care  Thus wise and potent awful and humane  JUSTICE and LAW support the guiding rein  Like kindred powers each seated at the helm  They steer that stately bark the ENGLISH REALM  And for a moment should one quit the post  Like sympathizing twins the other's lost  But knit together in connection strong  This must go right the other can't go wrong  Proud through the waves tho'  oudly roars the gale  Amid'st the public storm secure they sail  Unhurt they bring the vessel to the strand  Lords of the subject ocean as the land  Thus in our isle as the proud MUSE shall sing  In ampler lays when next she spreads the wing  Thus in our isle her LAWS securely stand  A guardian fabric of the smiling land  Prop of HUMANITY and seen from far  Bright as the lustre of the morning star  All hail thou glory of fair England's throne  Illustrious Prince this fabric is thy own  All hail thou hero of the Saxon line  Britannia's LAWs Britannia's FREEDOM thine  Rich in the varied powers of head and heart  In every science skill'd in every art  With prudence valour thought with action join'd  The circling VIRTUES temper'd and combin'd  The reconcil'd extremes of  Good  and  Great  Thine by a kind felicity of fate  Ardent in war in gentle peace serene  Wise in the public as the private scene  Coolness to plan and vigour to pursue  And born to mould a rugged state anew  Whose fancy dazzled yet whose judgment sound  Bade every virtue  know its proper bound  Whate'er Philosophy has drawn sublime  Or poet's sung in all the pride of rhime  Whatever history of good has giv'n  The Boast of nature and the smile of Heav'n  Adorn'd thy youth and to complete the plan  And give the perfect model of a man  Worthy thy mind Nature bestow'd the grace  Of princely stature and engaging face  Then in the noblest light her work to bring  In times of trial stamp'd thee for a King  Yes ALFRED thou beheld'st with generous pain  Bloodspotted Fury and his demons reign  Scarce shone the crown upon thy princely head  E'er rapine paus'd and foul disorder fled  Oft as th' invaders for the plunder burn'd  Thou warrioursovereign to the charge return'd  And when compell'd to quit the regal seat  Still like thyself was sought the soft retreat  Veild by the shepherd cot and clown's attire  Still glow'd within thee all the patriot's fire  Dismiss'd the regal pomp its train resign'd  No fate could sink the  monarch in thy mind  The kingly glories there their state maintain'd  There their sit mansion all the Virtues reign'd  Expiring LIBERTY engag'd thy care  For her to heav'n still breath'd thy fervent prayer  Beneath the humblest shed she fill'd thy breast  The humblest shed ennobled by the guest  There while th' unconscious neat herd toil'd and sung  The dart was pointed and the bow was strung  Till trimm'd for death they twang'd against the foe  And sav'd Britannia at one powerful blow  Like some young lyon chain'd for many a day  At length let loose broad Conquest mark'd thy way  Thou from the Dane th' enchanted standard bore  And bade fierce Hubba vex the isle no more  In vain the magic sisters were implor'd  The charmbound raven own'd another Lord  'Twas thine in new disguises to assail  Touch the tun'd harp and weave the mazy tale  Then while thy country's foes repos'd supine  Again in arms confess'd they saw thee shine  As with one soul they dar'd the martial deed  For at thy side 'twas victory to bleed  Th' invaders soon a Conqueror allow'd  And every haughty tribe to ALFRED bow'd  But peace restor'd 'twas thine to pity foes  The  arrow  sped the guardian  shield  arose  Broad o'er the vanquish'd multitude they spread  Dead the fierce war thy enmity was dead  Now bloom'd the arts of peace the pow'rs of trade  And tow'ring Cities tow'ring Fleets were made  Neglected Science rear'd again her head  And Erudition rose as from the dead  Chear'd by thy touch awak'd the tuneful Nine  For royal hands wove wreaths around their shrine  To arts as arms thy genius led the way  Together twin'd the olive and the bay  At once the King the Bard the Patriot shone  The muses laurel flourish'd round the throne  Of SOCIAL life thine too the faultless plan  Foes warm'd to friends and the heart beat to man  To fair HUMANITY was struck the lay  And from the tuneful charm what heart would stray  'Twas then brown Industry began his lore  And billowbraving Commerce brought his ore  But chief THE LAWS Oh ALFRED fir'd thy thought  For Oh to those what hidden truths were brought  'Twas then ev'n monarchy was happiness  Power chang'd his nature Kings began to bless  As thy own thoughts thou mad'st each Briton free  Yet mark'd the line 'twixt vice and liberty  Laws fallen structure touch'd thy kingly soul  And Phoenixlike from ashes sprang the whole  From old materials where the atoms lay  'Twas thine to call the chaos into day  'Twas thine O royal architect at length  To give proportion beauty softness strength  The LAWS OF ALFRED like a temple shone  All nations bow'd to ALFRED'S  equal throne  Truth power and confidence support the base  Beauty and love the superstructure grace  King subject alien the strong arch sustain  Friends kindred neighbours worship at the fane  And while the whole connected with each part  The laws of NATURE bless'd the laws of ART  Sanction'd their sway saw all was fair and good  A THRONE OF PEACE REAR'D IN A REALM OF BLOOD  END OF THE FIRST BOOK  HUMANITY  BOOK II  PROUD of the contrast with indignant lay  Once more O Muse to Gallia bend thy way  Explore yon Cavern frowning on the sight  When one faint lamp sends forth a sickly light  Through folds of darkness where yon wicket glooms  Perfidious POWER has scoop'd the living tombs  Along the filth that oozes from the walls  The slimy snail with track abhorent crawls  And oft augmenting poisons from the top  With sullen sound falls slow the withering drop  The pestilential toad that squats below  Gathers fresh venom as those poisons flow  Here many a fathom down despotic Rage  Hung human victims in the dreadful cage  Here the poor Captive torn from child and wife  From youth to age groan'd out detested life  Nor nature's sun nor arts supplying blaze  E're stole one beam of comfort on his days  Nor human form nor human hand was nigh  To sooth the grief that gather'd in his eye  Save one brief glance of man as thro' the hole  His daily bread the silent goaler stole  No human voice beguil'd the endless night  That cruel shut him from creation's light  To sooth a mistress wanton Louis gave  To one who dar'd be just this lingering grave  To one who dare a prostitute pourtray  And bring his honest Satire into day  How sinks the heart to pace this gloomy round  How pants the Muse to leave this tyrant ground  But ere she turn to Afric let her fly  Where slav'ry blooms beneath the fairest sky  Thee desolated ASIA once the blest  In every charm of lavish nature dress'd  Where favor'd Paradise heav'nplanted stood  A scene of wonders rising from the flood  The holy spot by all the prophets trod  Seat of the saints and sojourn of the God  Where FAITH her Christian temples rear'd around  And blood of Martyrs sanctified the ground  Where ev'n REDEMPTION like a Cherub came  And REVELATION spread th' enlight'ning flame  But oh thou Land of Heav'n itself belov'd  What dire events what changes hast thou prov'd  How has time alter'd ev'ry charm of youth  Since first thou heard'st the oracles of truth  Forgot the Heavenly claims that once were thine  Forgot the precepts breath'd from lips divine  Vain all the fathers all a saviour taught  And God expell'd for what th' Imposter brought  A sensual creed by a mock prophet prais'd  The sacred BIBLE sunk the KORAN rais'd  Disgrac'd the truths which all th' Apostles gave  Thy Prince a tyrant and Thyself a slave  Ah what avails thy medicinal floods  Thy citron breezes and thy palmy woods  What tho' the Cassia breathes along thy shore  And trickling manner adds its essenc'd store  Tho' gums balsamic in thy vallies grow  And both the India's in thy region glow  Thine tho' Olympus dear from classic fame  And honour'd Hermon a more holy name  Tho' the tall Cedar decks thy fragrant shrine  And lofty Lebanon himself be thine  From fair Euphrates ev'n to Jordan's wave  Tho' thy rich Coast the hallow'd waters lave  And tho' thy fruits voluptuously dispense  A keener relish to th' invited sense  Tho' on thy flowers a bolder bloom prevail  And send more piercing odour to the gale  And tho' thy skies yet salient and serene  Call fair Hygea to the tempting scene  All all these blessings a strong balance find  In one broad curse that seizes on thy kind  Nor this the pest that oft has thinn'd thy plains  A plague more fatal in thy Tyrant reigns  Fierce thro' the East see Despotism run  More fell more fatal than the torrid sun  Frantic before him move a sanguine band  The ruthless agents of his murd'rous hand  Skulking behind in dumb allegiance wait  Nurs'd up in blood his various tools of fate  To torture life and hideous deaths devise  In varied shapes of cruelty they rise  Dey Sultan Signior Emperor and King  Chief Visier Cailif each inferior Thing  Some do his bidding in the noon of day  And some at midnight seize upon their prey  Submission terror chastisement combine  To sink the abject vassal to the swine  Reason below degraded instinct falls  And Man is bound like herds within the stalls  His spirit dies subdued by hard controul  The useless body moves without a soul  No spark of heav'nly fire the mass can warm  Nor public virtue touch nor private charm  But general cowardice by horror bred  Courage unstrung and manly honour dead  For oh the dart the gibbet and the wheel  Are the least terrors that a slave can feel  Of these the anguish scarce can rage its hour  Ere Death appears in soft relief of power  Death a kind refuge in the last despair  But long a life of slavery who can bear  LO PERSIA'S tyrant with unnatural strife  To please a minion robs a child of life  With savage rage can blind the firstborn son  And partial lift a second to the throne  When the proud Sopha has consign'd to death  'Tis treason but to beg a parent's breath  The sentence past the  look  that aims to save  Condemns to equal fate the pitying slave  Sensual religion aids the tyrants will  And blood for ever reeks along the steel  In dire suspence like Damocles's sword  By a slight thread hangs lifea tyrant's word  Imposts and Edict vex the groaning land  And ev'n the fountain flows but at command  In dread MOGUL the laws must all be bought  Ere the case opens must a gift be brought  The greedy Emperor ope's his craving hand  And Justice driv'n by Av'rice quits the land  Nay yet more brief the Turkish powers decide  For there the Judge condemns th' accus'd untried  There turns the suit as wills the proud Bashaw  Who holds the place of destiny and law  This god of earth and brother of the Sun  Breaks up the court before the case be known  Or strikes the head from some officious slave  Who at the bloody verdict dares be grave  Yet here the tyrant's self is insecure  For no succession to the Crown is sure  A race of strangled kindred pave the way  And oft the scepter'd slave is made a prey  O Hapless ASIA whilst such horror reigns  What BRITISH MUSE will rest upon thy plains  Yet should she steer again to AFRIC'S sand  There too she sees Oppression lifts his hand  Within the tropics fiercer than the blaze  That fires the earth with iron rod he sways  Ev'n from the fertile Nile to Niger's waves  'Tis but a change of tyrants and of slaves  O pride enormous impudence of man  But let not Britons imitate the plan  Frame no false systems and then call them wise  Or make distinctions where no difference lies  Alas full oft the European face  Masks a mind darker than the

Than Christian incense from a savage heart  And his wild Tambour beat to idol shouts  To heav'n ascend before the organ's notes  Say what the pomps of science or of prayer  If the poor Indian's

scourg'd Negro blushing shalt thou see  Lo as the Muse to Anticosta steers  Mid'st the wild waves HUMANITY appears  Escap'd the wreck although their barks were lost  Whole crews were dash'd upon a savage coast  The coast tho' savage there the Christians find  Each Godlike feeling in an Indian mind  For touch'd by cries that pierc'd the piny wood  The natives sought the margin of the flood  Then as th' expiring Christians caught their view  To human grief the generous Indians flew  The social passion glowing in his face  Thus spoke a Chieftain of the sable race  "Haste children haste behold where brothers lie  "Rise strangers rise the hand of help is nigh  "Men like ourselves throughout the globe command  "The shelt'ring bosom and the aiding hand  "All all are kinsimen of a different hue  "Our faces vary but our hearts are true  "Ye poor white wanderers on our bounty thrown  "Your griefs are sacred and your wants our own"  This said he gently to his Cottage led  Smil'd on his guests and yielded up his bed  Then watch'd till morn a guardian at the door  Bless'd and was blessed  could a Christian more  To trace each VIRTUE thro' the sultry Sands  Next Negro HONOUR all thy praise demands  In CUJOE'S generous soul it meets the view  And darts a glory thro' his tawny hue  A band of Christian pirates sought the shore  And many an Indian from their forests bore  One soe to CUJOE'S

ours  "'Tis not our rage 'tis justice that devours"  Mean time th' exhausted Christian gasp'd for breath  When Cujoe rose and stopp'd th' impending death  "My Friends forbear the guilty seek and slay  "Pursue the race that stole our tribes away  "May Ocean whelm them in the deepest wave  "The guilty punish but the blameless save  "Of Guest and friend ah reverence the ties  "Lo this sick Christian on my faith relies  "Here in the rights of Friendship shall he rest  "My arm his buckler and his shield my breast  "This Cot his Citadel and ere  he  die  "Here must your hatchets fall your arrows

Boasts an high FEELING Briton proud as thine  The faithful QUASHI with his master bred  The same their mansion and the same their bed  Together us'd in infant times to play  Their friendship strengthen'd in life's riper day  The slave was trusty and the lord was kind  To QUASHI'S care the property assign'd  His labours clos'd he took the transient rest  Then chid the Sun yet loit'ring in the East  Ere peep'd the dawn his daily toils he sought  And daily wealth to his lov'd lord he brought  Envy at length a poison'd arrow drew  Which wing'd with mischief to the master flew  Of dire neglect the accusation came  And lo the sentence past for QUASHI'S shame  A public punishment was now decree'd  And the next Morn was QUASHI doom'd to bleed  The injur'd Slave with shudd'ring horror heard  And at deep midnight sought his barbarous Lord  Then wrought to agony these words address'd  The poignard trembling at his Master's breast  "O Thou whom no rememberance can move  "Nor cradled tenderness nor boyish love  "Dare not to think that QUASHI'S soul will bear  "The public Insults which thy hands prepare  "Think not the bloody Morn these eyes shall view  "Nor think for pardon that

but still the speaking eye  Own'd the rich gift of sweet HUMANITY  But when she heard her infant had been bought  Ev'n as the flame its tender limbs had caught  "O Indian God Oh Godlike White she said  While o'er her sable cheek the crimson spread  "All that a parent all a slave can give  "O Godlike White O Indian God receive"  Kneeling she wept then kiss'd her rescu'd Child  While in her jetty arms the Infant smil'd  Dances and Songs of Praise now struck the waves  And one strong charm like magic touch'd the slaves  Thro' the long voyage obedient they remain  Nor sounding whip was heard nor clanking chain  Touch'd is thy heart O Merchant of thy kind  Does human Softness steal into thy mind  Rous'd is the spark too long repress'd by Gold  Then bend thy heart to what we next unfold  Now while perchance the human passions move  O view the force of Friendship and of Love  In Negro bosoms see those powers at strife  Which form the bliss and agony of life  ZEBRON and ZABOR of the jetty race  Were first in feature and proportion'd grace  Bright as the Antelope their radiant eyes  As the proud Palmtree tower'd their equal size  Both wore alike the Tyger's speckled spoil  Brothers in dress in pastime and in toil  Slaves tho' they were ev'n Slav'ry had its charms  For ZEBRON'S comfort was in ZABOR'S arms  And ZABOR fainting on the arid sand  Was rear'd to Joy by gentle ZEBRON'S hand  By bliss united much by sorrow more  A Negro's Fate they soften'd while they bore  But Love at last a keener pang imparts  For sable ZELIA triumph'd o'er their hearts  Her skin of Ebony bestow'd a grace  That far outshone an alabaster face  So thought the youths with equal truth inspir'd  With all their passion all their climate fir'd  Each scorn'd to ravish each refus'd to yield  And Love and Friendship both maintain'd the field  Devouring torments spread the mutual flame  But still their friendship still their love the same  When beauteous ZELIA in their view appears  ZEBRON and ZABOR melt in mutul tears  Oft both embracing to renounce her swear  And Friendship seems to link them in despair  At length their conflicts big with every grief  And ev'ry passion sought a dire relief  At close of day as ZELIA trac'd the wood  The Lovers follow'd and before her stood  The wand'ring Maid too fatal in her charms  Now snatch'd to ZEBRON'S now to ZABOR'S arms  The fondest vows that ever Lovers swore  The deepest groans that ever heav'd they pour  Then with clos'd eyes and heads declin'd they dart  The mutual daggers in her bounding heart  Speechless she fell her sobs their shrieks confound  They clasp the victim and they kiss the wound  Then raise the poignards streaming in her blood  And with their own augment the crimson flood  Thus Negro Virtues Negro Frailties shine  Say fairer Savage do they yield to thine  Their ardent virtues emulate thy own  Their errors are the errors of their zone  Art thou then still Supreme of human race  Still boasts thy Nature the superiour grace  Ah no without thy cultivating arts  Worth greatness goodness elevates their hearts  The tow'ring spirit in their bosoms move  They hate with vigour as with force they love  Together leagu'd till death they faithful toil  And smooth the wrong that chains them to the soil  Still hand in hand their direful loads they bear  Divide each joy and mitigate despair  Vivid as Thine the sense of joy and pain  Thrills in each pulse and vibrates in each vein  When hope inspires behold as bright a ray  Illumes their eyes and o'er their features play  When grief assails the tears as copious flow  To mark the soft or agonizing woe  When the lash scourges or the pincers rend  A shriek as piercing from the heart they send  Ere the brave spirit of the man is broke  Ev'n with a Briton's scorn they spurn the yoke  Love of their native Land that magic charm  Against an host hath made an handful arm  They love like Thee the soil that gave them birth  And treasure up each particle of earth  Fondly embosom'd ere they leave the shore  And kiss the sacred relique o'er and o'er  Muscians Poets too by nature taught  A song spontaneous bursting from a thought  Swift into measure subjects seem to fly  As transient objects transient themes supply  Nature to harmony attunes the ear  And her nice touches o'er their limbs appear  Each nerve extatic springs to the rebound  And every motion seems to paint a sound  The sweet enthusiasm ev'ry grief beguiles  And the scourg'd Captive even in anguish smiles  With thrilling passion ev'ry feature glows  So strong the charm it cheats awhile their woes  Their Woes how countlessah illfated race  How shall I paint thy anguish and disgrace  Ah think not WHITE the Muse from fancy brings  Those woes which Hist'ry sanctions what she sings  Her bloody Annals still does Truth unfold  Stain'd with the victims of soulspotting gold  Yet who the Negro's sufferings can relate  Or mark the varied horrors of their fate  Where blushing Truth shall we their griefs begin  Or how commence the catalogue of Sin  Demons of torture ye who mock at woe  And smile to see the crimson bloodtrack flow  In horrid triumph rise from central Hell  Th' inventive pangs of Christian growth to tell  Oh aid the shuddering Muse to paint the grief  Which calls on death for pity and relief  Oh powers of Mercy loose that massy yoke  Oh hold that Arm for murder's in the stroke  Behold that axe the quivering limb assails  Behold that body weltering in its wails  Ah hear that Bludgeon fall that lash resound  Ah see those wretches writhing on the ground  See yonder mangled mass of Atoms lie  Behold that Christian's hands the flames apply  At the bare feet is laid the sulphurous train  Climbs to the heart and burns into the brain  Survey the triple horrors of their state  Doom'd in each change to be the sport of fate  Torn from their native land at first they come  And then are thrown into the sailing tomb  In wat'ry dens like coupled beasts they lie  And beg the mournful privilege to die  Than Man more kind but Death oft brings relief  Releases one while one survives to grief  The living wretch his dead associate sees  The body clasps and drinks the putrid breeze  Chain'd to the noxious corpse till rudely thrown  In the vex'd sea then left a slave alone  Ah wretch forlorn  thy  lot the most severe  Assassination would be mercy here  Methinks I hear thee cry "Ah give me death  "Give the last blow and stop this hated breath  "To arm this hand were holy innocence  "I call on suicide as self defence  "Oh for a sword to waft me to the shore  "Where never Christian White may torture more  "Curse curse me not with Being instant throw  "This loathsome body to the waves below"  His prayer deny'd condemn'd 'midst slaves to groan  The cruel Merchant marks him for his own  The scar by Christian cruelty imprest  Smoaks on his arm or blackens on his breast  The wattled oziers form his rugged bed  And daily anguish earns his daily bread  Short food and shorter rest and endless toil  Above the scourge below the burning soil  Soon with his sable Brothers must he go  "Doom'd to a sad variety of woe"  Like harness'd Mules o'er Afric's dreadful sand  In slow progression moves the mournful band  The length'ning files begin their circuit wide  While on their limbs are galling braces ty'd  Fraught with coarse viands see the straining throng  Drag the oppressive caravan along  The massy iron and the direful log  Their naked bodies ev'n in slumber clog  An iron collar o'er each neck is past  And iron rivets hold the collar fast  A tighten'd chain across each shoulder goes  While the dark driver takes his own repose  At length arriv'd the miserable band  Like the stall'd oxen pass from hand to hand  Ye friends of Man whose souls with mercy glow  Swell not your bosoms with this weight of woe  Fires not the social blood within your veins  To make the White Man feel the Negro's pains  Beat not your hearts the miscreant arms to bind  Of the proud Christian with a savage mind  Dost thou not pant to snap the impious chain  And rush to succour the insulted train  From servile bondage to free the hapless race  And fix the haughty tyrants in their place  Make  them  the weight of Slav'ry to know  Till their hard natures melt at social woe  Nor till they humanize to social men  Would ye restore them to their rights again  But Heav'n is just each tyrant in his turn  Is taught the rashness of his pride to mourn  Oft spreads his tortur'd Slave the secret snare  And hurls his Master in the last despair  Far from his couch the balmy slumber flies  And from his slave unnumber'd poisons rise  He knows to pest the herd to blast the soil  Perish the blossom and the harvest spoil  To mix the baneful juice the fatal flower  This sudden kills that boasts a mining power  He knows to scatter unsuspected fate  While circling mischiefs on his vengeance wait  At length he makes the Tyrant's self his prey  And rushes on him in the face of day  Or desperate seizes on the child and wife  Mad with his wrongs and takes their forfeit life  That thus the White man's progeny may groan  The Tyrant's lot to balance with his own  Oft from the cradle and the breast will tear  Ev'n his own babes in phrenzy of despair  With mingled rage and fondness stop their breath  And give them freedom in the arms of death  Oh FREEDOM sacred Goodess who inspires  Th' untutor'd Savage with sublimest fires  He  tho'  untutor'd rushes to the fray  Combats for passion and ne'er fights for pay  While the bought soldier bargains for his breath  A mercenary in the trade of death  The generous Indian from his fetters broke  Braves ev'ry peril to escape the yoke  Freedom's worst wants prefers to Slavery's food  And feeds from principle on Christian blood  Oft have the Chiefs o'er listed troops prevail'd  And Nature's warriours sped where armies fail'd  The difference mark t'wixt those who sight for hire  And those whom Freedom's genuine passions sire  Nay more when victors in the hardy sight  Restor'd by Conquest to then native right  Their wrongs are buried when the battle's o'er  And so mer injuries are heard no more  Yet taught distrust ere they consent again  With try'd deceivers Commerce to sustain  Th' appointed Leader of the sable band  Requires a pledge ere he extends the hand  The blood must flow from either warriours arm  And Earth and Water blend to form the charm  A Vase receives the mixturewho disdains  To taste the potion no alliance gains  Both parties drink in sign of mutual trust  And the proud tyrant's humbled to the dust  A stipulation vile is forc'd to crave  And own perforce a Master in the Slave  What will not FREEDOM'S Heav'ndescended fire  In cultur'd or in savage Souls inspire  The RIGHTS OF NATURE and of GOD to save  Men scoop the rock and build upon the wave  Explore the barren sand the marshes drear  And a free Cottage in the desert rear  Delight in hollow of some cave to dwell  Or dig thro' Earth the independent cell  See where MARINO lifts her craggy brow  Half hid in clouds and cover'd half with snow  Beyond the Appenines there Freedom reigns  And scorns the thraldom of Italian plains  There see untax'd the small republic grow  And spurn the bondage of the vales below  Close on the liberal Heav'n behold it stands  And proud looks down on tributary lands  What tho' those tributary lands display  The blooming fragrance of perpetual May  Like the coy sensitive each lovely flower  Still seems to tremble at the touch of power  Blest be the good Dalmatian's generous earth  Which boasts Oh Rome than thine a nobler birth  Thou but the refuge of a robber band  But there devotion rais'd the folded hand  And many a century this little state  Has stood the storms of Fortune and of Fate  Whilst thy sunk cities once the boast of Fame  Have nought to mark them but an empty name  What tho' no streams here lave the scant domain  But melting snows and reservoirs of rain  Tho' hillocks scatter'd round the parent hill  At once thy pride and penu'ry reveal  A narrow circuit and a labour'd soil  Which yields subsistance but to endless toil  Dear is the grain that decks thy Mountains side  Beyond the harvest of Italia's pride  In this small spot is seen one path alone  Where jealous freedom guides us to the town  There entering arts and arms and trade we view  For ev'ry Citizen's a soldier too  There laws are form'd on patriot Wisdom's plan  For ev'ry Citizen's an honest Man  There mines no Tyrant there no Courtiers flock  All good is common all is public stock  For general happiness there all combine  The one great aim and all to aid it join  Oh sainted founder of this virtuous land  Sublimely rais'd I see thy slatue stand  Ev'n where the Virgin consecrates the place  It fills with holy zeal thy generous race  With freeborn men thy Mount is cover'd o'er  While lost CAMPANIA glooms a desert shore  Say what but FREEDOM chear'd the Savage bands  That once o'erspread CANADIA's conquer'd lands  Wild as their woods behold uncheck'd they go  For sport or food arm'd simply with the bow  Save the thin Buffalo o'er their shoulders crost  Their hardy bosoms meet unfenc'd the frost  The casual chace their banquet and their toil  They ask'd no bounty from the sullen soil  If to their prayer to range at large was giv'n  They thought unbounded liberty was Heav'n  The gods invok'd their Sylvan wars to aid  The stag was slain the board a captive made  The female hunters journey'd with the men  And fearless track'd the monster to his den  And when at eve the warm pursuit was o'er  Nor twang'd the bow nor sped the arrow more  They sprung from light repose ere peep of day  And thro' the humid desarts took their way  Of forest growth their pamper'd sloth might view  Nature's brave Caesars and wise Tullys too  Active ferocious bold unaw'd they stood  Troops of the lake and armies of the wood  Vers'd in no science lesson'd in no art  They breath'd the eloquence that reach'd the heart  Unknown the classic pomp of pedant schools  Their Oratory rose o'er colder rules  It beam'd defiance in the flashing eye  Storm'd in the shout and melted in the sigh  In tranquil hours it gave the smile serene  In public tumult shew'd th'indignant mien  The vivid tone and vital glance express'd  All the strong passions of the warriour's breast  When the rude Chief his brave harangue began  The Savage rose to Hero and to Man  And when th' invader tore him from the soil  Dear scene of all his pride of all his spoil  No artificial mockery of woe  Or taught his cheek to change his tears to flow  With pious awe he kneel'd to kiss the ground  And fondly press'd his sorrowing friends around  "Oh weeping Brothers this our place of birth  "Our fathers Ashes consecrate the earth  "Should the foe drag us to a foreign shore  "Those sacred ashes we can guard no more  "The holy relicts as entomb'd they lay  "Some wretch unhallow'd may usurp as prey  "Leave leave not thus our Sires to Christian rage  "But ah with filial wrath the conflict wage"  Thus thro' the globe in Nature's earliest dawn  For FREEDOM only was the arrow drawn  The plain rough ancient at his threshold stood  And held that freedom dearer than his blood  Whate're the forest or the lakes bestow  Fruits of his lance his angle and his bow  The fur that warms him or the hut that shields  The scanty harvest which his culture yields  Earn'd by his strength was by his strength maintain'd  He felt his own what honest labour gain'd  Part of himself his  liberty  he thought  And reason sanctified what nature taught  Nor force of bribes nor frauds of gold he knew  For life and liberty the sword he drew  Corruption was the growth of later times  When Avarice reconcil'd the polish'd crimes  A gentle modern of the Christian kind  That rose and flourish'd as vice grew refin'd  An European which in search of grain  Taught freeborn men to bear and hug the chain  See FREEDOM smiling thro' the realms of frost  And glow on Labradore's inclement coast  Tho' darkness sheds deep night thro' half the year  And snow invests the climethat clime is dear  For there fair LIBERTY resides and there  At large the native breasts the searching air  Where blows the arctic tempests icy gale  And famine seizes on the spermy whale  The bearded Esquimaux half robb'd of sight  Roves uncontroul'd content with FREEDOM'S light  His country loves to all its ills conforms  Endures its caverns and accepts its storms  For the huge Seadog spreads the nimble oar  Nor sighs for blessings of a softer shore  No languid Suns unnerve his hardy race  Which bless'd with Freedom range from place to place  Such too BRITANNIA were THY savage Sons  Thro' all thy tribes the dread of Slav'ry runs  Th' mild heroic honest without laws  They brav'd each peril in fair Freedom's cause  But ah full many an age in Gothic night  Was veil'd th' effulgence of their native right  Tho' like the rocky Barrier of their coast  That Freedom now is her sublimest boast  Full many an age dissension shook her Fane  From Rome's fierce Caesar to the stormy Dane  In whelming tides pour'd in the Saxon clan  And Normans finish'd what their rage began  The savage Briton to his Mountains fled  Alternate triumph'd and alternate bled  War upon wars on conquest conquests throng  Vandal drove Goth and Goth urg'd Gaul along  On human flesh the savage Victors eat  And mistic Druids shar'd the sanguine treat  These to their altars e'en while truth they taught  The trembling sacrifice rapacious brought  Impostorpriests before their Idols stood  And talk'd of Heav'n with hands embru'd in blood  Before their eyes imagin'd spectres glare  Spirits were heard and fancy'd ghosts were there  Religion Law and Government their own  Bloody their Altars bloody was their Throne  Thro' the vex'd Isle the sanguine edict spread  That Heav'n demanded mountains of the dead  In the dark grove which Superstition trod  Priests hid their spoils yet commun'd with their God  And muttering rights within the fearful gloom  Stab a fresh victim and the feast resume  Unfelt as yet the soft'ning ties of life  Deep in the prisoner's breast the ruthless knife  The Female plung'dcould savage man do more  Then idly prophesied as flow'd the gore  A rage of slaughter then  that  sex possess'd  Now with each grace of melting Pity blest  But soon the Tyrants sought themselves to save  For soon Invaders pierc'd the Druid cave  Forth from the Baltic pour'd the deathful host  And train'd to havock crimson'd all the coast  The Northern Hive swarm'd terrible around  And every Altar smoak'd upon the ground  Fire sword and carnage spotted every hand  Swell'd the gorg'd tomb and delug'd all the land  Different in mind and manners as in face  The Normans came an innovating race  Their power their passions and their pride they brought  Fierce bold and bloody and with conquest fraught  From the forc'd mixture of a foreign breed  Unnatural customs laws and wars succeed  The  Saxon  superstition weak as dire  In two extremes of water and of fire  The burning ploughshare and the cauldron hot  To prove the Culprit innocent or not  Were lenient mercies to the cruel strife  That  then  with horror hung a cloud on life  Then by no ties of law or nature bound  Assassination took its deathful round  In every grove the lurking stabber lay  And human bloodshed clotted all the way  In every street the mangled corpse appear'd  And mutual hate the sanguine standard rear'd  In slavish homage to an haughty Lord  All social joy was broken at the board  From house to house the Tyrant's edict ran  And the Feast ended ere the Mirth began  At the eighth hour toll'd out by dread command  The dreary knell that darken'd all the land  Wisdom her lessons could no more impart  Nor Friendship gladden or improve the heart  Ere to their bliss the genial hours invite  Oppression shed impenetrable night  The friendly faggot chear'd the heart no more  And all the soft'ning blooms of life were o'er  To ruin'd Juries the dire sword succeeds  And at each pore insulted Justice bleeds  Ev'n rural pastime in that iron age  No more to jovial sports the youth engage  The savage beasts which Nature gave to all  To glut th' insatiate pride of  one  must fall  No more the chace no more the woods were free  All all was Hatefor all was SLAVERY  The Lawyer  Clergy  too and  Baron  proud  Aping their Prince struck terror thro' the croud  Next bigot  Priests  th' imposing mandate bring  And yoke the Neck of each succeeding King  Rome sent her  Monks  and superstition reign'd  Freedom in bonds and even  Conscience  chain'd  Impious as vain the Pope his terrors laid  Ignorance was awed and folly was afraid  Fair Truth in fetters was like Reason bound  And dread Anathema's were peal'd around  Pomp of procession and parade of prayer  Pardon and curse dealt mercy or despair  The heart was tainted and the head confus'd  And all the attributes of God abus'd  People and Prince were in one chaos hurl'd  Law Justice Order Virtue left the World  Eventful BRITAIN should the Muse display  The various bloodtracks which then mark'd thy way  Should she pursue the havoc of the sword  That gash'd thee first then crouching call'd thee Lord  Or trace the Deluges of Foreign Gore  That ran in purple torrents thro' thy shore  As conquest oft her crimson pinion spread  And different victors different mischiefs bred  Thy hardiest Sons would tremble but to view  The fearful picture that her pencil drew  Then let her pause ere she these deeds rehearse  A subject sacred to her future verse  Last and what greater proofs can now remain  Touch we the border of SURINAM'S plain  Lo there the purchas'd NEGROES may'st thou see  Bursting their bonds and daring to be free  In daring bands from caves and rocks they come  And wrought to blood like trooping Panthers roam  The swart Mulattoes to the forests fly  Resolv'd to live in freedom or to die  Blest be the man and worthy to be blest  Friend of the Wretched Guardian of th' oppress'd  Blest be the Manye Negroes bow the knee  And bless him Thou Oh sweet HUMANITY  Who scorning interest thus pourtray'd the plan  That gave to Men the awful rights of Man  "Awake my friends at mercy's call awake  "Haste haste the chains of Slavery to break  "Oh Race dishonour'd whose sad forms we tear  "Nor heed our species heed our kindred there  "Too long on sordid Altars have ye bled  "From Christian hearts too long has Mercy fled  "At length return'd the Goddess brings relief  "From Heav'n she comes to sooth the Captive's grief  "My brethren rise the galling chains unbind  "And give the generous Model to mankind  "What Avarice seiz'd let Justice now restore  "Let Negroes serve but serve as Slaves no more  "This the new Law  Let each a shackle rend  "  Till Freedom reigns and Slavery shall end  "  Or if the  NAME  of Slave must yet remain  "  Strive not for words so we remove the pain    "  Strive not for words so we the rights supply  "  The ravish'd rights of sweet  HUMANTIY"  The good Man spake applauding thousands bow'd  The Hero triumph'd and the Christian glow'd  Unnumber'd Hearts by great example fir'd  Bent to the Law HUMANITY requir'd  Unnumber'd Manacles that moment broke  Unnumber'd Slaves were loosen'd from the yoke  Unnumber'd Hands were folded up in air  Unnumber'd Voices breath'd a grateful prayer  Unnumber'd Eyes so lately bath'd in woe  Ah blissful change with tears of joy o'erflow  From God the spark began to Man it came  Till all perceiving all partook the flame  Heav'n's fire electric as one touch'd the ball  It struck a second till it spread to all  Soon generous England shalt thou catch the flame  And added Laurels shall adorn thy fame  Soon shall HUMANITY assert her cause  Soon shall the Slave find shelter in thy Laws  Those equal Laws that grace thy pregnant Isle  Where all the Bounties and the Blessings smile  Where rich and poor and high and low obey  Their gentle rule and amicable sway  Where  Sovereigns  view their lofty roofs ascend  While LAW and LIBERTY the Throne defend  Where  Subjects  see their mansions firmly stand  Nor fear the Rapine of the strongest Hand  Where the poor  Peasant  knows his Cot secure  Humble in size but on foundations sure  Where boldly fenc'd his little Garden grows  And not a King can rob him of a Rose  Thus in the crouded Hive tho' all agree  To choose a Monarch all the rest are free  Plebeian Cells as sacred as the great  And both contribute honey to the State  Oh launch the Bark unfurl th' impatient Sails  Swell ye kind Seas and blow ye fostering Gales  Oh haste some Angel thro' the realms of air  To Afric's Sons the rapt'rous tidings bear  Thrice happy he who first shall reach the strand  And spread the joys of Freedom thro' the Land  His the glad welcome of an Heavenly guest  His the rich bliss to see "his fellows blest"  And lo methinks on Fancy's wing convey'd  The MUSE already gains the palmy shade  Herself the messenger to Afric's plains  Ardent she flies to break the tyrantchains  Her voice already hails the lift'ning croud  And thus she speaks her Embassy aloud  "I come I come from sweet HUMANITY  "To sooth the Sad and set the Captive free  "Heirs as ye are to all that Nature gave  "Congenial Nature who ne'er made a slave  "Whose Minds can reason and whose Hearts can move  "With all the joys and agonies of Love  "Sublime on Nature's scale ye Beings rise  "Equals on Earth as equals in the skies  "All all are Men in Life and Death the same  "And Virtue only can distinction claim  "Where Freedom bids now take your blithsome way  "Yours the fair morn and yours the closing day  "Yours is the jocund eve its sports command  "Or on the cooling wave or barren sand  "If in your breasts the Patriot passions burn  "To your lov'd Country to your Homes return  "Free unconfin'd where'er your course ye bend  "Still still shall LIBERTY your steps attend"  They hear with dumb surprize till raptures rise  And these blest sounds reecho to the skies  "Negroes are Men and Men are Slaves no more  "Fair Freedom reigns and Tyranny is o'er"  And now they trace each scene of former love  Explore each favour'd haunt hill vale and grove  And soon the wellremember'd huts they find  Where faithful Friends and Loves were left behind  Sudden before her sable lord appears  Th' enfranchis'd wife adorn'd with faithful tears  Mothers again their kidnapped babes behold  Sons clasp their Sires in slavery grown old  Here their own Niger rises to the sight  And there their Nile's prolific banks invite  Far as extend these parent floods they range  Feel all at large and triumph in the change  Yet mov'd by generous deeds their bosoms burn  To merit freedom by a kind return  Methinks I see them leave their native plain  And touch'd by honour seek their lords again  Methinks I see them now no scourge is there  In willing Tribes to scenes once curs'd repair  Led on by gratitude they stoop to toil  Double their industry and bless the soil  They quit the whizzing dart and twanging bow  Collect the grass and reassume the Hoe  Ev'n troops of sable Children brave the sea  To kiss the hands which set their fathers free  Blest expectation here the MUSE shall pause  And watch HUMANITY thy righteous cause  But soon again shall she the globe survey  And dare the dangers of her  promis'd  lay  While in procession pass the human race  Shall boldly view each tinge of mind as face  With curious eye the gradual change shall mark  As wond'rous Nature shifts from light to dark  Shall visit tribes beneath the polar skies  Of shape uncouth diminutive of size  Pass to the Tartar of an Olive shade  Untam'd untutor'd and robustly made  Next move to Asia's duskytinctur'd race  Of foster form nor destitute of grace  Then the swarth African and yellow Moor  Which spread their sable hues along the shore  Last wild America's eventful clan  And European cultur'd into Man  These to descry the Muse her course shall bend  Far as discover'd earth and seas extend  Thro' the wide universe shall vent'rous roam  Nor till the Globe be measur'd seek her home  But not content the surface to display  Hues habits manners customs to pourtray  Her future song a bolder flight shall try  And trace the magic powers of clime and sky  Track Education and Religion's hand  And note the law that governs ev'ry land  Observe if Elements that cloud with strife  Or smile in peace most rule the springs of life  See how from each at work upon the mind  Springs the diversity of Human Kind  Next varying modes of LIBERTY survey  From where she thrives to where she melts away  Now proud to claim the independent soul  Now her tame Spirit passive to controul  For ever weak where tyranny assails  For ever strong where milder rule prevails  There like vile oxen stooping to the yoke  Here gaining sudden freedom at a stroke  Still will she find compact in ev'ry part  Is form'd the chain that fastens heart to heart  Millions of links but all arrang'd are seen  The rivets clos'd and not a chasm between  And where they disproportion'd meet our eyes  Or seem of different form or different size  Here if more polish'd there more rude they shew  Or colour'd various as the show'ry bow  Still one bright zone girds ocean earth and sky  Thy beauteous zone oh sweet HUMANITY  Lo the chain lengthens as the Links are plac'd  Amid'st the flow'ry dale or barren waste  Some with the whit'ning Billows froth around  Some bathe in streams that never pass their bound  Some redd'ning flame on Aetna's burning brow  And some are cover'd with Siberian snow  Some with th' brooding Mine in darkness hide  And some in dazzling floods of light reside  Some reach the clouded Regions of the North  Where tawny Zembla pours her Children forth  Some where keen Lapland bids the freezing train  Chase the fleet reindeer o'er the icy plain  Some stretch to milder climes remote from storms  Where nature rises in her gentler forms  Still still thro' ev'ry clime may we behold  The chain but brightens as the links unfold  Where'er dispers'd they spread to ev'ry soul  And God tis God alone that links the whole  These shall the Muse with ardent wing explore  Nor give at fear's vain threat th' enquiry o'er  An awful Task yet hope the Lyre shall string  And aid the Muse to spread the daring wing  Ye silken Bards repose in beds of flowers  And in soft sonnets court the sylvan powers  Neptune Diana Wave or Woodnymph woo  Bid Thrushes sweeter sing Doves fonder coo  The lazy Poppy nodding o'er your Brows  While at your feet the languid water flows  Silent along as if afraid to creep  Lest its unguarded lapse should rouse from sleep  Ah sweetly slumber undisturb'd by sense  Then gently wake to tuneful Indolence  Crop the pale shrub that e'en in plucking dies  But leave the plant that blossoms in the skies  Nor rash nor diffident the Muse shall sweep  From Clime to Clime and dare the giddy steep  Still to the Sun aspiring try the height  Cleave the dense air and hope to gain the light  Mean time to soothe her speeds a generous throng  To cheer her labour and assist her song  These while she tries the unattempted way  Shall bid her soar and animate her Lay  And tho' the fiends who dread the Muse should rise  With Serpent malice hiss her as she flies  Full many a laurell'd Bard to Science dear  Compose her Terrors and her Spirits cheer  And while she droops beneath the growing Toil  Her Song approve and give th' inspiring smile  FINIS
