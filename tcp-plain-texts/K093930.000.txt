HAYLEY ESQ  THE SECOND EDITION CONSIDERABLY ENLARGED  Effigiem conor efficere quae hoc diuturnior erit quo verior melior absolutior fuerit  PLIN EPIST Lib Ep  DEDICATION TO THE REV  JOSEPH WARTON  D D  c  MY PLEASANT AND RESPECTABLE FRIEND  IN prefixing your name to this volume I feel and confess the double influence of an affectionate and of an ambitious desire to honour you and myself Our lost and lamented Friend GIBBON has told us I think very truly in dedicating a juvenile work to his Father that there are but two kinds of Dedications which can do honour either to the Patron or the Authorthe first arising from literary esteem the second from personal affection If either of these two characteristics may be sufficient to give propriety to a Dedication I have little to apprehend for the present which has certainly the advantage of uniting the two  The kind and friendly manner in which you commended the first edition of this Life might alone have induced me to inscribe a more ample copy of it to that literary  veteran whose applause is so justly dear to me I have additional inducements in recollecting your animated and enlightened regard for the glory of MILTON It is pleasing to address a sympathetic friend on a subject that interests the fancy and the heart I remember with peculiar gratification the liberality and frankness with which you lamented to me the extreme severity of the late Mr Warton in describing the controversial writings of Milton I honour the rare integrity of your mind my candid friend which took the part of injured genius and probity against the prejudices of a brother eminent as a scholar and entitled also in many points of view to your love and admiration I sympathize with you most cordially in regretting the severity to which I allude so little to be expected from the general temper of the critic and from that affectionate spirit with which he had vindicated the poetry of Milton from the misrepresentations of cold and callous austerity But Mr Warton had fallen into a mistake which has betrayed other welldisposed minds into an unreasonable abhorrence of Milton's prose I mean the mistake of regarding it as having a tendency to subvert our existing government Can any man justly think it has such a tendency who recollects that no government similar to that which the Revolution established for England existed when Milton wrote His impassioned yet disinterested ardour for reformation was  excited by those gross abuses of power which that new settlement of the state very happily corrected  Your learned and goodnatured brother my dear friend was not the only man of learning and goodnature who indulged a prejudice that to us appears very extravagant to give it the gentlest appellation A literary Paladine if I may borrow from romance a title of distinction to honour a very powerful historian even Gibbon himself whom we both admired and loved for his literary and for his social accomplishments surpassed I think on this topic the severity of Mr Warton and held it hardly compatible with the duty of a good citizen to republish in the present times the prose of Milton as he apprehended it might be productive of public evil For my own part although I sincerely respected the highly cultivated mind that harboured this apprehension yet the apprehension itself appeared to me somewhat similar to the fear of Falstaff when he says  I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy though he be dead  As the prose of Milton had a reference to the distracted period in which it arose its arguments if they could by any means be pointed against our existing government are surely as incapable of inflicting a wound as completely dead for all the purposes of hostility as the noble Percy is represented when he excites the ludicrous terror of Sir John but while I presume to describe the prose of Milton as  inanimate in one point of view let me have the justice to add that it frequently breathes so warm a spirit of genuine eloquence and philanthropy that I am persuaded the prophecy of its great author concerning it will be gradually accomplished its defects and its merits will be more temperately and justly estimated in a future age than they have hitherto been The prejudices so recently entertained against it by the two eminent writers I have mentioned were entertained at a period when a very extraordinary panic possessed and overclouded many of the most elevated and enlightened minds of this kingdom a period when a retired student could hardly amuse himself with perusing the nervous republican writers of the last century without being suspected of framing deadly machinations against the monarchs of the present day and when the principles of a Jacobin were very blindly imputed to a truly English writer of acknowledged genius and of the purest reputation who is perhaps of all men living the most perfectly blameless in his sentiments of government morality and religion But happily for the credit of our national understanding and our national courage the panic to which I allude has speedily passed away and a man of letters may now I presume as safely and irreproachably peruse or reprint the great republican writers of England as he might translate or elucidate the political visions of Plato a writer whom Milton passionately  admired and to whom he bore I think in many points a very striking resemblance Perhaps they both possessed too large a portion of fancy and enthusiasm to make good practical statesmen the visionaries of public virtue have seldom succeeded in the management of dominion and in politics it has long been a prevailing creed to believe that goverment is like gold and must not be fashioned for extensive use without the alloy of corruption But I mean not to burthen you my lively friend with political reflections or with a long dissertation on the great mass of Milton's prose you whose studies are so various and extensive are sufficiently familiar with those singular compositions and I am not a little gratified in the assurance that you think as I do both of their blemishes and their beauties and approve the use that I have made of them in my endeavours to elucidate the life and character of their author Much as we respected the classical erudition and the taste of your lamented brother I am confident that we can neither of us subscribe to the censure he has passed on the Latin style of Milton who to my apprehension is often most admirably eloquent in that language and particularly so in the passage I have cited from his character of Bradshaw a character in which I have known very acrimonious enemies to the name of the man commended very candidly acknowledge the eloquence of the eulogist Some rigorous idolaters of the unhappy race of Stuart may yet censure me even for this dispassionate  revival of such a character but you my liberal friend to the freedom of literary discussion you will suggest to me that the minds of our countrymen in general aspire to Roman magnanimity in rendering justice to great qualities in men who were occasionally the objects of public detestation and you join with me in admiring that example of such magnanimity to which I particularly allude Nothing is more honourable to ancient Rome than her generosity in allowing a statue of Hannibal to be raised and admired within the walls of the very city which it was the ambition of his life to distress and destroy  In emulation of that spirit which delights to honour the excellencies of an illustrious antagonist I have endeavoured to preserve in my own mind and to express on every proper occasion my unshaken regard for the rare faculties and virtues of a late extraordinary biographer whom it has been my lot to encounter continually as a very bitter and sometimes I think an insidious enemy to the great poet whose memory I have fervently wished to rescue from indignity and detraction The asperity of Johnson towards Milton has often struck the fond admirers of the poet in various points of view in one moment it excites laughter in another indignation now it reminds us of the weapon of Goliah as described by Cowley  A sword so great that it was only fit  To cut off his great head that came with it  now it prompts us to exclaim in the words of an angry Roman  Nec bellua tetrior ulla est  Quam servi rabies in libera colla furentis  I have felt I confess these different emotions of resentment in perusing the various sarcasms of the austere critic against the object of my poetical idolatry but I have tried and I hope with some success to correct the animosity they must naturally excite by turning to the more temperate works of that very copious and admirable writer particularly to his exquisite paper in the Rambler N  o  on the deaths and asperity of literary men It is hardly possible I think to read the paper I have mentioned without losing for some time at least all sensations of displeasure towards the eloquent the tender moralist and reflecting with a sort of friendly satisfaction that as long as the language of England exists the name of JOHNSON will remain and deserve to remain  Magnum et memorabile nomen  As long as eloquence and morality are objects of public regard we must revere that great mental physician who has given to us all infirm mortals as the best of us are such admirable prescriptions for the regimen of mind and we should rather speak in sorrow than in anger when we are forced to recollect that like other physicians  however able and perfect in theory he failed to correct the infirmity of his own morbid spirit You my dear Warton whom an opposite temperament has made a critic of a more airy and cheerful complection you are one of the best witnesses that I could possibly produce if I had any occasion to prove that my ideas of Johnson's malevolent prejudices against Milton are not the offsprings of a fancy equally prejudiced itself against the great author whose prejudices I have presumed to oppose you my dear friend have heard the harsh critic advance in conversation an opinion against Milton even more severe than the many detractive sarcasms with which his life of the great poet abounds you have heard him declaim against the admiration excited by the poetry of Milton and affirm it to be nothing more than the cant to use his own favourite phrase of affected sensibility  I have presumed to say that Johnson sometimes appears as an insidious enemy to the poet Is there not some degree of insidious hostility in his introducing into his dictionary under the article Sonnet the very sonnet of Milton which an enemy would certainly chuse who wished to represent Milton as a writer of verses entitled to scorn and derision You will immediately recollect that I allude to the sonnet which begins thus  A book was writ of late called Tetrachordon  The sonnet is in truth contemptible enough if we suppose that Milton intended it as a serious composition but I apprehend it was an idle  lusus poeticus  and either meant as a ludicrous parody on some other sonnet which has sunk into oblivion or merely written as a trifling pastime to shew that it is possible to compose a sonnet with words most unfriendly to rhyme However this may be it was barbarous surely towards Milton and I might add towards the poetry of England to exhibit this unhappy little production in so conspicuous a manner as a specimen of English sonnets Yet I perceive it is possible to give a milder interpretation of Johnson's design in his display of this unfortunate sonnet and as I most sincerely wish not to charge him with more malevolence towards Milton than he really exerted I will observe on this occasion that as he had little or rather no relish for sonnets which the stern logician seems to have despised as perplexing trifles  difficiles nugae  he might only mean to deter young poetical students from a kind of verse that he disliked by leading them to remark how the greatest of our poets had failed in this petty composition You who perfectly know how much more inclined I am to praise than to censure will give me full credit for my sincerity in saying that I wish to acquit Johnson of malevolence in every article where my reason will allow me to do so I have been under the painful necessity of  displaying continually in the following work the various examples of his severity to Milton Nothing is more apt to excite our spleen than a stroke of injustice against an author whom we love and revere but I should be sorry to find myself infected by the acrimony which I was obliged to display and I should be equally sorry to run into an opposite failing and to indulge a spirit of obloquy like Mrs Candour in the School for Scandal with all the grimaces of affected good nature I have spoken therefore my own feelings without bitterness and without timidity I cannot say that I speak of Johnson  sine ira et studio  as Tacitus said of other great men very differently great for in truth I feel towards the same object those two opposite sources of prejudice and partiality as a critical biographer of the poets he often excites my transient indignation but as an eloquent teacher of morality he fills me with more lasting reverence and affection  His lives of the poets will probably give birth in this or the next century to a work of literary retaliation Whenever a poet arises with as large a portion of spleen towards the critical writers of past ages as Johnson indulged towards the poets in his poetical biography the literature of England will be enriched with "the Lives of the Critics" a work from which you my dear Warton will have little to apprehend you whose essay teaches as  the critical biographer very truly and liberally observed  how the brow of criticism may be smoothed and how she may be enabled with all her severity to attract and delight  Yet to shew how apt a writer of verses is to accuse a profest critic of severity we may both recollect that when I had occasion to speak of your entertaining and instructive Essay on Pope I scrupled not to consider the main scope of it a little too severe and in truth my dear friend I think so still because it is the aim of that charming Essay to prove that Pope possessed not those very high poetical talents for which the world though sufficiently inclined to discover and magnify his defects had allowed him credit You consider him as the poet of reason and intimate that "he stooped to truth and moralized his song" from a want of native powers to support a long flight in the higher province of fancy To me I confess his Rape of the Lock appears a sufficient proof that he possessed in a superlative degree the faculty in which you would reduce him to a secondary rank he chose indeed in many of his productions to be the poet of reason rather than of fancy but I apprehend his choice was influenced by an idea I believe a mistaken idea that moral satire is the species of poetry by which a poet of modern times may render the greatest service to mankind But if in one article you have been not so kind as I could wish to the  poet of morality I rejoice in recollecting that you are on the point of making him considerable amends and of fulfilling a prediction of mine by removing from the pages of Pope a great portion of the lumber with which they were amply loaded by Warburton You will soon I trust prove to the literary world as you perfectly proved to me some years ago that the poet has suffered not a little from the absurdities of his arrogant annotator It is hardly possible for a man of letters who affectionately venerates the name of Milton and recollects some expressions of Warburton concerning his poetry and his moral character to speak of that supercilious prelate without catching some portion of his own scornful spirit you will immediately perceive that I allude to his having bestowed upon Milton the opprobrious title of a timeserver  With what peculiar propriety Warburton applied this name to Milton the reader will best judge who recollects the humorous Butler's very admirable character of a timeserver which contains the following passage  He is very zealous to shew himself upon all occasions a true member of the church for the time being and has not the least scruple in his conscience against the doctrine and discipline of it as it stands at present or shall do hereafter unsight unseen for he is resolved to be always for the truth which he believes is never so plainly demonstrated as in that character that says  'it is great and prevails'  and in that sense only fit to be adhered to by a prudent man who will never be kinder to truth than she is to him for suffering is a very  evil effect  and not likely to proceed from a  good cause  Butler's Remains vol ii p  Do you recollect my dear learned critic extensive as your studies have  been do you recollect in the wide range of ancient and modern defamation a more unpardonable abuse of language Milton a poet of the most powerful and perhaps the most independent mind that was ever given to a mere mortal insulted with the appellation of a timeserver and by whom by Warburton whose writings and whose fortunebut I will not copy the contemptuous prelate in his favourite exercise of reviling the literary characters whose opinions were different from his own his habit of indulging a contemptuous and dogmatical spirit has already drawn upon his name and writings the natural punishment of such verbal intemperance and the mitred follower of his fame and fortune who has lately endeavoured to prop his reputation by a tenderly partial but a very imperfect life of his precipitate and quarrelsome patron has rather lessened perhaps his own credit than increased that of his master by that affected coldness of contempt with which he describes or rather disfigures the illustrious chastiser of Warburtonian insolence the more accomplished critic of whom you eminent scholars of Winton are very justly proud I mean the eloquent and graceful LOWTII  But as I am not fond of literary strife however dignified and distinguished the antagonists may be I will hasten to extricate myself from this little group of contentious critics for it must be matter of regret to every sincere  votary of peace and benevolence to observe that the field of literature is too frequently a field of cruelty which almost realizes the hyperbolical expression of Lucan and exhibits  Plusquam civilia bella  where men whose kindred studies should humanize their temper and unite them in the ties of fraternal regard are too apt to exert all their faculties in ferociously mangling each other where we sometimes behold the friendship of years dissolved in a moment and converted into furious hostility which though it does not endanger yet never fails to embitter life and perhaps the source of such contention  teterrima belli  Causa  instead of being a fair and faithless Helen is nothing more than a particle of grammar in a dead language O that the spleencorrecting powers of mild and friendly ridicule could annihilate such hostilitiesCannot you my dear Warton who have the weight and authority of a pacific Nestor in this tumultuous field cannot you suggest effectual lenitives for the  genus irritabile scriptorum  The celebrated Saxon painter Mengs has I think given us all an admirable him of this kind in writing to an ingenious but petulant Frenchman who had provoked him by  speaking contemptuously of his learned and enthusiastic friend Winkelman Se io possedessi il talento di scriver bene says the modest painter vorrei esporre ragioni e fatti e insegnar cose utili senza perdermi a contradir veruno poiche mi sembra che si possan fare buoni libri senza dire che il tale o il tul sogetto s' inganna e finalmente se ella mi puo dimostrare che la maldicenza sia cosa honesta allora io converrò che importa molto poco il modo con cui si attacca la riputazione del prossimo e aggiungo che il sarcasmo e l' insulto sono la peggior maniera di mormorare e di biasimare donde risulta sempre il maggior danno a chi lo usaOpere di Mengs tomo primo p  These admonitions are excellent and want only the good example of the monitor to make them complete but Mengs unfortunately in his professional writings has spoken of Reynolds in a manner that grossly violates his own doctrine so difficult is it my good Doctor to find a pacific preacher and his practice in perfect harmony with each other  To feeling and fervent spirits there can hardly be any provocation more apt to excite asperity of language than an insult offered to an object of their esteem and veneration In writing upon Milton and those who to my apprehension have insulted his name with contumelious severity I may have been hurried beyond the bias of my  temper which is I trust neither irascible nor censorious but I will imitate some well meaning catholic writers and making you my dear Warton my inquisitor as well as my patron I will here very honestly say to you  Si quid dixerim contra spiritum caritatis evangelicae indictum volo  Let me now hasten to apologize to you as I think I ought for such deficiencies as your nice discernment cannot fail to observe in the work I address to you You remember that Plutarch the amiable prince of ancient biographers has very justly mentioned the advantage arising to a writer from residing in a city amply furnished with booksit is my lot you know to live in a little sequestered village and I chuse to do so for the reason which attached the goodnatured Plutarch to his native Cheronaea that it may not become less Had it suited me to devote much time and labour to extensive researches in the public and private libraries of London it is possible that I might have discovered some latent anecdotes relating to Milton yet after the patient inquiries of the intelligent and indefatigable Dr Birch and after the signal discovery of your more successful brother little novelty could be expected to reward the toil of such investigation and perhaps a writer too eager to make new discoveries on this beaten ground might be hurried by such eagerness into the censurable temerity of Peek the antiquarian who  in his memoirs of the great poet has affixed the name of Milton to a portrait and a poem that do not belong to him  Though my work has been executed in a retired village of England my enquiries have extended far beyond the limits of our own country by the aid of some intelligent and obliging friends who had the kindness to search for me the great libraries of Paris and Rome in the hope of discovering some neglected composition or latent anecdote that might be useful to a biographer of Milton The success of these researches has not been equal to the kindness and the zeal of the intelligent enquirers but an unexpected favour from a literary friend who is known to me only by his writings has enabled me to throw perhaps a new ray of light on that inviting subject of conjecture the real origin of Milton's greatest performance  In the dissertation which I have annexed to this life of the poet you will find some account of an Italian dr  m on the inhabitants of Paradise which though it rises not to the poetical spirit of Andreini may have  d some influence I apprehend on the fancy of Milton You will also find that I have followed your example in recommending your old acquaintance Andreini  o the notice of the public He happened to engage my attention when the health of my revered friend Mr Cowper  allowed him to be my guest and after our more serious morning studies it afforded us a pleasant relaxation and amusement to throw some parts of the  Adamo  into English in a rapid yet metrical translation In this joint work or rather pastime it would be needless if it were possible to distinguish the lines of the united translators as the version had no higher aim than to gratify the curiosity of the English reader without aspiring to praise A very different character is due to that version of Milton's Latin poetry which my excellent friend has finished with such care and felicity that even from the separate specimens of it with which this life is embellished you my dear Warton and every delicate judge of poetry will I am confident esteem it an absolute model of poetical translation For the honour of Milton and for that of his most worthy interpreter I hope that the whole of this admirable performance may be soon imparted to the public as I trust that returning health will happily restore its incomparable author to his suspended studies an event that may affect the moral interest and the mental delight of all the worldfor rarely very rarely indeed has heaven bestowed on any individual such an ample such a variegated portion of true poetical genius and never did it add greater purity of heart to that divine yet perilous talent to guide and sanctify its exertion Those who are best acquainted with the writings and the virtues of my  inestimable friend must be most fervent in their hopes that in the course and the close of his poetical career he may resemble his great and favourite predecessors Homer and Milton their spirits were cheered and illuminated in the decline of life by a fresh portion of poetical power and if in their latter productions they rose not to the full force and splendor of their meridian glory they yet enchanted mankind with the sweetness and serenity of their descending light  Literature which Cicero has so eloquently described as the friend of every period and condition of human existence is peculiarly the friend of age a truth of which you my dear Warton are a very lively illustrationyou who at a season of life when unlettered mortals generally murmur against the world are ministering to its instruction and its pleasure by continuing to write with temper vivacity and grace  That you may long retain and display this happy assemblage of endowments so rare in a critical veteran is the cordial wish of many and particularly the wish of your very sincere and affectionate friend  W H  Eartham  October    THE LIFE OF  MILTON  PART I  L' ETA PRECORSE E LA SPERANZA E PRESTI  PAREANO I FIOR QUANDO N' USCIRO I FRUTTI  TASSO  THE character of MILTON has been scrutinized with all the minuteness of investigation which opposite passions could suggest The virulent antagonist and the enraptured idolater have pursued his steps with equal pertinacity nor have we wanted men of learning and virtue who devoid of prejudice and enthusiasm both in politics and in poetry have endeavoured to weigh his merits exactly in the balance of truth and reason  What new light then can be thrown upon a life whose incidents have been so eagerly collected and so frequently retailed What novelty of remark can be expected in a review of poems whose beauties and blemishes have been elaborately examined in critical dissertations that almost rival in excellence the poetry they discuss Assuredly but little yet there remains perhaps one method of giving a  degree of interest and illustration to the life of Milton which it has not hitherto received a method which his accomplished friend of Italy the Marquis of Villa in some measure adopted in his interesting life of Tasso and which two engaging biographers of later date the Abbé de Sade and Mr Mason have carried to greater perfection in their respective memoirs of Petrarch and of Gray By weaving into their narrative selections of verse and prose from the various writings of those they wished to commemorate each of these affectionate memorialists may be said to have taught the poet he loved "to become his own biographer" an experiment that may perhaps be tried on Milton with the happiest effect as in his works and particularly in those that are at present the lead known he has spoken frequently of himselfNot from vanity a failing too cold and low for his ardent and elevated mind but in advanced life from motives of justice and honour to defend himself against the poisoned arrows of slander and in his younger days from that tenderness and simplicity of heart which lead a youthful poet to make his own affections and amusements the chief subjects of his song  The great aim of the subsequent account is to render full and perfect justice to the general character of Milton His manners and cast of mind in various periods of life may appear in a new and agreeable light from the following collection and arrangement of the many little sketches which his own hand has occasionally given us of his passions and pursuits Several of these indeed have been fondly assembled by Toland or Richardson men who different as they  were in their general sentiments and principles yet sympathized completely in their zeal for the renown of Milton delighting to dwell on his character with  that shadow of friendship that complacency and ardour of attachment which as Pope has observed in speaking of Homer we naturally feel for the great geniuses of former time  But those who have endeavoured to illustrate the personal history of the great English Author by exhibiting passages from some of his neglected works have almost confined themselves to selections from his prose  There is an ampler field for the study of his early temper and turn of mind in his Latin and Italian Poetry here the heart and spirit of Milton are displayed with all the frankness of youth I select what has a peculiar tendency to shew in the clearest light his native disposition because his character as a man appears to have been greatly mistaken I am under no fear that the frequency or length of such citations may be exposed to censure having the pleasure and advantage of presenting them to the English reader in the elegant and spirited version of a poet and a friendwith pride and delight I add the name of Cowper This gentleman who is prepared to oblige the world with a complete translation of Milton's Latin and Italian poetry has kindly favoured me with the liberty of transcribing from his admirable work whatever I wish to insert in this narrative Since I am indebted to Milton for a friendship which I regard as honourable in the highest degree may I be indulged in the hope of leaving a lasting memorial of it in these pages  A book devoted to the honour of Milton may admit I hope without impropriety the praises due to a living author who is become his poetical interpreter an office which the spirit of the divine bard may be gratified in his having assumed for assuredly my friend bears no common resemblance to his most illustrious predecessor not only in the energy and hallowed use of poetical talents but in that beneficent fervour and purity of heart which entitle the great poet to as large a portion of affectionate esteem as he has long possessed of admiration  JOHN MILTON was born in London on the th of December at the house of his father in Breadstreet and baptized on the th of the same month His christian name descended to him from his grandfather The family once opulent proprietors of Milton in Oxfordshire lost that estate in the civil wars of York and Lancaster and was indebted perhaps to adversity for much higher distinction than opulence can bestow John the grandfather of the poet became deputy ranger in the forest of Shotover not far from Oxford and intending to educate his son as a gentleman he placed him at ChristChurch in that university but being himself a rigid Papist he disinherited the young and devout scholar for an attachment to the doctrines of the Reformation and reduced him to the necessity of quitting the path of literature for a less honourable but more lucrative profession  The discarded student applied himself to the employment of a scrivener which has varied with the variations of life and  manners A scrivener in remoter ages is supposed to have been a mere transcriber but at the period we speak of his occupation united the two profitable branches of drawing contracts and of lending money The emoluments of this profession enabled the father of Milton to bestow most abundantly on his son those advantages of education which had been cruelly withdrawn from himself The poet was happy in both his parents and to the merits of both he has borne affectionate and honourable testimony The maiden name of his mother has been disputed but it seems reasonable to credit the account of Philips her grandson the earliest biographer of Milton who had the advantage of living with him as a relation and a disciple  Her name according to this author who speaks highly of her virtue was Caston and her family derived from Wales Milton in mentioning his own origin with a decent pride in reply to one of his revilers asserts that his mother was a woman of exemplary character and peculiarly distinguished by her extensive charity  Londini sum natus genere honesto patre viro integerrimo matre probatissimà et eleemosynis per viciniam potissimum no  a  Defensio secund  The parental kindness and the talents of his father he has celebrated in a Latin poem which cannot be too warmly admired as a monument of filial tenderness and poetical enthusiasm It is probable that the severe manner in which that indulgent father had been driven from the pursuits of learning induced him to exert uncommon liberality and ardour in the education of his son Though immersed himself in a lucrative occupation he seems to have retained great elegance of mind and to have  amused himself with literature and music to the latter he applied so successfully that according to Dr Burney the accomplished historian of that captivating art "he became a voluminous composer equal in science if not in genius to the best musicians of his age" Nor did his talents pass without celebrity or reward Philips relates that for one of his devotional compositions in forty parts he was honoured with a gold chain and medal by a Polish prince to whom he presented it This mark of distinction was frequently conferred on men who rose to great excellence in different arts and sciences perhaps the ambition of young Milton was first awakened by these gifts of honour bestowed upon his father  The father of Milton has been lately mentioned as an authorHe was thought to have published in the year of the poet's birth a little book with the quaint title of "A Sixe Fold Politician"Mr Warton observed that the curious publication ascribed to Milton's father may be found in the Bodleian library that "it appears to be a satire on characters pretending to wisdom or policy and is not void of learning and wit such as we often find affectedly and awkwardly blended in the essaywriters of that age"  By the favour of Mr Isaac Reed who is most liberal in the communication of the literary rarities he has collected I have perused this singular performance and perfectly agree with its obliging possessor and his accomplished friend Dr Farmer that▪ although in the records of the Stationers Company it is ascribed to John Milton we may rather assign it to John Melton author of the Astrologaster than to the father of our poetThe latter will lose but little in being no longer regarded as its author especially as we have different and more honourable proofs of his attachment to literature    A parent who could enliven the drudgery of a dull profession by a variety of elegant pursuits must have been happy to discern and eager to cherish the first dawning of genius in his child In this point of view we may contemplate with peculiar delight the infantine portrait of Milton by that elegant and faithful artist Cornelius Jansen Aubrey the antiquarian observing in his manuscript memoirs of our  author that he was ten years old when this picture was drawn affirms that "he was then a poet" This expression may lead us to imagine that the portrait was executed to encourage the infant author and if so it might operate as a powerful incentive to his future exertion The permanent bias of an active spirit often originates in the petty incidents of childhood and as no human mind ever glowed with a more intense or with a purer flame of literary ambition than the mind of Milton it may not be unpleasing to conjecture how it first caught the sparks that gradually mounted to a blaze of unrivalled vehemence and splendor  His education as Dr Newton has well observed united the opposite advantages of private and public instruction Of his early passion for letters he has left the following record in his second defence  Pater me puerulum humaniarum literarum studiis destinavit quas ita avide arripui ut ab anno aetatis duodecimo vix unquam ante mediam noctem a lucubrationibus cubitum discederem quae prima oculorum pernicies suit quorum ad naturalem debilitatem accesterant et crebri capitis dolores quae omnia cum discendi impetum non retardarent et in ludo literario et sub aliis domi magistris erudiendum quotidie curavit  "My father destined me from my infancy to the study of polite literature which I embraced with such avidity that from the age of twelve I hardly ever retired from my books before midnight This proved the first source of injury to my eyes whose natural weakness was attended with frequent pains of the head but as all these disadvantages could not repress my ardour for learning my father took care to have me instructed by various preceptors both at home and at school" His domestic tutor was Thomas Young of Essex who being obliged to quit his country on account of religious opinions became minister  to the English merchants at Hamburgh It was probably from this learned and conscientious man that Milton caught not only his passion for literature but that steadiness and unconquerable integrity of character by which he was distinguished through all the vicissitudes of a tempestuous life His reverential gratitude and affection towards this preceptor are recorded in two Latin epistles  The high opinion which Milton entertertained of his preceptor is so gracefully expressed in one of these letters that I select it as a specimen of his epistolary style in the early period of life  Thomae Junio  Inspectis literis tuis preceptor optime unicum hoc mihi supervacaneum occurrebat quod tardae scriptionis excusationem attuleris tametsi enim literis tuis nihil mihi queat optabilius accedere qui possim tamen aut debeam sperare otii tibi tantum à rebus seriis et sanctioribus esse ut mihi

letters my excellent preceptor this only appeared to me superfluous that you apologize for a delay in writing for although nothing can be more desirable to me than your letters yet what right have I to hope that your serious and sacred duties can allow you such leisure that you can always find time enough to answer me especially when your writing is entirely an act of kindness and by no means of duty The many and recent favours I have received from you will by no means suffer me to suspect that you can forget me nor can I conceive it possible that having loaded me with such benefits you should now dismiss me from your remembrance I shall willingly attend your summons to your rural retirement on the first appearance of spring to enjoy with equal relish the delights of the season and of your conversation I shall withdraw myself for a little time from the bustle of the city to your porch in Suffolk as to the famous portico of the Stoic or the Tusculum of Cicero where ennobling a moderate estate by an imperial mind you reign contentedly in your little field like a Serranus or a Curius and triumph as it were over opulence ambition pomp luxury and whatever is idolized by the herd of men by looking down upon fortune but as you excuse yourself for delay let me hope that you will forgive me for haste since having deferred this letter to the last moment I chose to send a few lines though not very accurately written rather than to be silent Farewell my revered friend  and a Latin elegy addressed  to him they suggest a most favourable idea of the poet's native disposition and furnish an effectual antidote to the poison of that most injurious assertion that "he hated all whom he was required to obey"Could untractable pride be the characteristic of a mind which has expressed its regard for a disciplinarian sufficiently rigid with a tenderness so conspicuous in the following verses of the fourth Elegy  Vivit ibi antiquae clarus pietatis honore  Praesul christicolas pascere doctus oves  Ille quidem est animae plusquam pars altera nostrae  Dimidio vitae vivere cogor ego  Hei mihi quot pelagi quot montes interjecti  Me faciunt aliâ parte carere mei  Charior ille mihi quam tu doctissime Graium  Cliniadi pronepos qui Telamonis erat  Quamque Stagyrites generoso magnus alumno  Quem peperit Lybico Chaonis alma Jovi  Qualis Amyntorides qualis Phylirëius heros  Myrmidonum regi talis et ille mihi  Primus ego Aonios illo praeunte recessus  Lustrabam et bifidi sacra vireta jugi  Pieriosque hausi latices Clioque favente  Castalio sparsi laeta ter ora mero  There lives deep learn'd and primitively just  A faithful steward of his Christian trust  My friend and favourite inmate of my heart  That now is forc'd to want its better part  What mountains now and seas alas how wide  Me from my other dearer self divide  Dear as the sage renown'd for moral truth  To the prime spirit of the Attic youth  Dear as the Stagyrite to Ammon's son  His pupil who disdain'd the world he won  Nor so did Chiron or so Phoenix shine  In young Achilles' eyes as he in mine  First led by him thro' sweet Aonian shade  Each sacred haunt of Pindus I survey'd  Explor'd the fountain and the Muse my guide  Thrice steep'd my lips in the Castalian tide  And again in expressing his regret upon the length of their separation  Nec dum ejus licuit mihi lumina pascere vultu  Aut linguae dulces aure bibisse sonos  Nor yet his friendly features feast my sight  Nor his sweet accents my fond ear delight  As the tenderness of the young poet is admirably displayed in the beginning of this Elegy his more acknowledged characteristic religious fortitude is not less admirable in the close of it  At tu sume animos nec spes cadat anxia curis  Nec tua concutiat decolor ossa metus  Sis etenim quamvis fulgentibus obsitus armis  Intententque tibi millia tela necem  At nullis vel inerme latus violabitur armis  Deque tuo cuspis nulla cruore bibet  Namque eris ipse dei radiante sub aegide tutus  Ille tibi custos et pugil ille tibi  Et tu quod superest miseris sperare memento  Et tu magnanimo pectore vince mala  Nec dubites quandoque frui melioribus annis  Atque iterum patrios posse videre lares  But thou take courage strive against despair  Shake not with dread nor nourish anxious care  What tho' grim war on every side appears  And thou art menac'd by a thousand spears  Not one shall drink thy blood not one offend  Ev'n the defenceless bosom of my friend  For thee the aegis of thy God shall hide  Jehovah's self shall combat on thy side  Thou therefore as the most afflicted may  Still hope and triumph o'er thy evil day  Trust thou shalt yet behold a happier time  And yet again enjoy thy native clime  The reader inclined to symphatise in the joys of Milton will be gratified in being informed that his preceptor whose exile and poverty he pathetically lamented and whose prosperous return he predicted was in a few years restored  to his country and became Master of Jesus College in Cambridge  As the year in which he quitted England corresponds with the fifteenth year of his pupil's age it is probable that Milton was placed at that time under the care of Mr Gill and his son the former chief master of St Paul's school the latter his assistant and afterwards his successor It is remarkable that Milton who has been so uncandidly represented as an uncontroulable spirit and a spurner of all just authority seems to have contracted a tender attachment to more than one disciplinarian concerned in his education He is said to have been the favourite scholar of the younger Gill and he has left traces of their friendship in three Latin epistles that express the highest esteem for the literary character and poetical talents of his instructor  On the th of February he was entered not as as a sizar which some of his biographers have erroneously asserted but as a pensioner of Christ's College in Cambridge "At this time" says Doctor Johnson  he was eminently skilled in the Latin tongue and he himself by annexing the dates to his first compositions a boast of which the learned Politian had given him an example seems to commend the carliness of his own proficiency to the notice of posterity but the products of his vernal fertility have been surpassed by many and particularly by his contemporary Cowley Of the powers of the mind it is difficult to form an estimate many have excelled Milton in their first essays who never rose to works like Paradise Lost  This is the first of many remarks replete with detraction in which an illustrious author has indulged his spleen against Milton in a life of the poet where an illsubdued propensity to censure is ever combating with a necessity to commend The partisans of the powerful critic from a natural partiality to their departed master affect to consider his malignity as existing only in the prejudices of those who endeavour to counteract his injustice A biographer of Milton ought therefore to regard it as his indispensible duty to show how far this malignity is diffused through a long series of observations which affect the reputation both of the poet and the man a duty that must be painful in proportion to the sincerity of our esteem for literary genius since different as they were in their principles their manners and their writings both the poet and his critical biographer are assuredly entitled to the praise of exalted genius Perhaps in the republic of letters there never existed two writers more deservedly distinguished not only for the energy of their mental faculties but for a generous and devout desire to benefit mankind by their exertion  Yet it must be lamented and by the lovers of Milton in particular that a moralist who has given us in the Rambler such sublime lessons for the discipline of the heart and mind should be unable to preserve his own from that acrimonious spirit of detraction which led him to depreciate to the utmost of his power the rare abilities and perhaps the still rarer integrity of Milton It may be said that the truly eloquent and splendid encomium which he has bestowed on the great work of the poet ought to exempt  him from such a charge The singular beauties and effect of this eulogy shall be mentioned in the proper place and with all the applause they merit but here it is just to recollect that the praise of the encomiast is nearly confined to the sentence he passes as a critic his more diffusive detraction may be traced in almost every page of the biographer not to encounter it on its first appearance and wherever it is visible and important would be to fail in that justice and regard towards the character of Milton which he perhaps of all men has most eminently deserved  In the preceding citation it is evidently the purpose of Dr Johnson to degrade Milton below Cowley and many other poets distinguished by juvenile compositions but Mr Warton has with great taste and judgment exposed the error of Dr Johnson in preferring the Latin poetry of Cowley to that of Milton An eminent foreign critic has bestowed that high praise on the juvenile productions of our author which his prejudiced countryman is inclined to deny Morhoff has affirmed with equal truth and liberality that the verses which Milton produced in his childhood discover both the fire and judgment of maturer life a commendation that no impartial reader will be inclined to extenuate who peruses the spirited epistle to his exiled preceptor composed in his eighteenth year Some of his English verses bear an earlier date The first of his juvenile productions in the language which he was destined to ennoble is a paraphrase of the hundred and fourteenth psalm it was executed at the age of fifteen and discovers a power that Dryden and other more presumptuous critics have  unjustly denied to Milton the power of moving with facility in the fetters of rhyme this power is still more conspicuous in the poem he wrote at the age of seventeen on the death of his sister's child a composition peculiarly entitled to the notice of those who love to contemplate the early dawn of poetical genius In this performance puerile as it is in every sense of the word the intelligent reader may yet discern as in the bud all the striking characteristics of Milton his affectionate sensibility his superior imagination and all that native tendency to devotional enthusiasm  Which sets the heart on fire  To spurn the sordid world and unto Heav'n aspire  Admirably trained as the youth of the poet was to acquire academical honour by the union of industry and talents he seems to have experienced at Cambridge a chequered fortune very similar to his destiny in the world It appears from some remarkable passages in the Latin exercises which he recited in his College that he was at first an object of partial severity and afterwards of general admiration He had differed in opinion concerning a plan of academical studies with some persons of authority in his college and thus excited their displeasure He speaks of them as highly incensed against him but expresses with the most liberal sensibility his surprise delight and gratitude in finding that his enemies forgot their animosity to honour him with unexpected applause  An idle story has been circulated concerning his treatment in College "I am ashamed" says Dr Johnson "to relate  what I fear is true that Milton was the last student in either University that suffered the public indignity of corporal punishment" In confirmation of this incident which appears improbable though supported by Mr Warton the biographical critic alledges the following passage from the first Elegy  Jam nec arundiferum mihi cura revisere Camum  Nec dudum vetiti me laris angit amor  Nec duri libet usque minas perferre magistri  Caeteraque ingenio non subeunda meo  Nor zeal nor duty now my steps impel  To reedy Cam and my forbidden cell  'Tis time that I a pedant's threats disdain  And fly from wrongs my soul will ne'er sustain  Dr Johnson considers these expressions as an absolute proof that Milton was obliged to undergo this indignity but they may suggest a very different idea From all the light we can obtain concerning this anecdote it seems most probable that Milton was threatened indeed with what he considered as a punishment not only dishonourable but unmerited that his manly spirit disdained to submit to it and that he was therefore obliged to acquiesce in a short exile from Cambridge  In speaking of his academical life it is necessary to obviate another remark of a similar tendency  "There is reason" says Johnson "to suspect that he was regarded in his college with no great fondness" To counteract  this invidious insinuation we are furnished with a reply made by Milton himself to this very calumny originally fabricated by one of his contemporaries a calumny which he had so fully refuted that it ought to have revived no more He begins with thanking his reviler for the aspersion "It has given me" he says  an apt occasion to acknowledge publicly with all grateful mind that more than ordinary favour and respect which I found above any of my equals at the hand of those courteous and learned men the Fellows of that College wherein I spent some years who at my parting after I had taken two degrees as the manner is signified many ways how much better it would content them that I would stay as by many letters full of kindness and loving respect both before that time and long after I was assured of their singular good affection towards me  Prose Works vol p  The Latin poems of Milton are yet entitled to more of our attention because they exhibit lively proofs that he possessed both tenderness and enthusiasm those primary constituents of a poet at an early period of life and in the highest degree they have additional value from making us acquainted with several interesting particulars of his youth and many of his opinions which must have had considerable influence on his moral character  His sixth Elegy addressed to his bosom friend Charles Diodati seems to be founded on the idea which he may be said to have verified in his own conduct that strict habits of temperance and virtue are highly conducive to the perfection of great poetical powers To poets of a lighter class  he recommends with graceful pleasantry much convivial enjoyment but for those who aspire to Epic renown he prescribes even the simple regimen of Pythagoras  Ille quidem parce Samii pro more magistri  Vivat et innocuos praebeat herba cibos  Stet prope fagineo pellucida lympha catillo  Sobriaque e puro pocula fonte bibat  Additur huic scelerisque vacans et casta juventus  Et rigidi mores et sine labe manus  Qualis veste nitens sacra et lustralibus undis  Surgis ad infensos augur iture Deos  Simply let these like him of Samos live  Let herbs to them a bloodless banquet give  In beechen goblets let their beverage shine  Cool from the crystal spring their sober wine  Their youth should pass in innocence secure  From stain licentious and in manners pure  Pure as Heaven's minister arrayed in white  Propitiating the gods with lustral rite  In his Elegy on the Spring our poet expresses the fervent emotions of his fancy in terms that may be almost regarded as a prophetic description of his sublimest work  Jam mihi mens liquidi raptatur in ardua caeli  Perque vagas nubes corpore liber eo  Intuiturque animus toto quid agatur Olympo  Nec fugiunt oculos Tartara caeca meos  I mount and undepressed by cumbrous clay  Thro' cloudy regions win my easy way  My spirit searches all the realms of light  And no Tartarean depths elude my sight  With these verses it may be pleasing to compare a similar passage in his English vacation exercise where addressing his native language as applied to an inconsiderable purpose he adds  Yet I had rather if I were to chuse  Thy service in some graver subject use  Such as may make thee search thy coffers round  Before thou clothe my fancy in fit sound  Such where the deep transported mind may soar  Above the wheeling poles and at Heav'n's door  Look in and see each blissful deity  How he before the thunderous throne doth lie  "It is worth the curious reader's attention to observe how much the Paradise Lost corresponds with this prophetic wish" says Mr Thyer one of the most intelligent and liberal of English commentators  The young poet who thus expressed his ambition was then in his nineteenth year At the age of twentyone the period of his life when that pleasing portrait of him was executed which the Speaker Onslow obtained from the executors of his widow he composed his Ode on the Nativity a poem that surpasses in fancy and devotional fire a composition on the same subject by that celebrated and devout poet of Spain Lopez de Vega  The most trifling performances of Milton are so singular that we may regret even the loss of the verses alluded to by Aubrey as the offspring of his childhood Perhaps no juvenile author ever displayed with such early force  The spirit of a youth  Who means to be of note  His mind even in his boyish days seems to have glowed like the fancy and furnace of an alchymist with incessant hope and preparation for astonishing productions  Such austerity and moroseness have been falsely attributed to Milton that a reader acquainted with him only as he appears in the page of Johnson must suppose him little formed for love but his poetry in general and especially the compositions we are now speaking of may convince us that he felt with the most exquisite sensibility the magic of beauty and all the force of female attraction His seventh Elegy exhibits a lively picture of his first passion he represents himself as captivated by an unknown fair who though he saw her but for a moment made a deep impression on his heart  Protinus insoliti subierunt corda furores  Uror amans intus flammaque totus eram  Interea misero quae jam mihi sola placebat  Ablata est oculis non reditura meis  Ast ego progredior tacite querebundus et excors  Et dubius volui saepe referre pedem  Findor et haec remanet sequitur pars altera votum  Raptaque tam subito gaudia flere juvat  A fever new to me of fierce desire  Now seiz'd my soul and I was all on fire  But she the while whom only I adore  Was gone and vanish'd to appear no more  In silent sorrow I pursue my way  I pause I turn proceed yet wish to stay  And while I follow her in thought bemoan  With tears my soul's delight so quickly flown  The juvenile poet then addresses himself to love with a request that beautifully expresses all the inquietude and all the irresolution of hopeless attachment  Deme meos tandem verum nec deme furores  Nescio cur miser est suaviter omnis amans  Remove no grant me still this raging woe  Sweet is the wretchedness that lovers know  After having contemplated the youthful fancy of Milton under the influence of a sudden and vehement affection let us survey him in a different point of view and admire the purity and vigour of mind which he exerted at the age of twentythree in meditation on his past and his future days  To a friend who had remonstrated with him on his delay to enter upon active life he ascribes that delay to an intense desire of rendering himself more fit for it  Yet he says that you may see that I am something suspicious of myselfe and doe take notice of a certain belatednesse in me I am  the bolder to send you some of my nightward thoughts some while since because they come in not altogether unfitly made up in a Petrarchian stanza which I told you of  How soon hath time the subtle thief of youth  Stol'n on his wing my three and twentieth year  My hasting days fly on with full career  But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th  Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth  That I to manhood am arriv'd so near  And inward ripeness doth much less appear  That some more timely happy spirits indu'th  Yet be it less or more or soon or slow  It shall be still in strictest measure even  To that same lot however mean or high  Towards which time leads me and the will of heaven  All is if I have grace to use it so  As ever in my great task master's eye  This sonnet may be regarded perhaps as a refutation of that injurious criticism which has asserted "the best sonnets of Milton are entitled only to this negative commendation that they are not bad" but it has a superior value which induced me to introduce it here as it seems to reveal the ruling principle which gave bias and energy to the mind and conduct of Milton I mean the habit which he so early adopted of considering himself  As ever in his great task master's eye  It was perhaps the force and permanency with which this persuasion was impressed on his heart that enabled him to ascend the sublimest heights both of genius and of virtue  When Milton began his course of academical study he had views of soon entering the church to "whose service" he says  by the intentions of my parents and friends I was destined of a child and in mine own resolutions  It was a religious scruple that prevented him from taking orders and though his mode of thinking may be deemed erroneous there is a refined and hallowed probity in his conduct on this occasion that is entitled to the highest esteem particularly when we consider that although he declined the office of a minister he devoted himself with intense application to what he considered as the interest of true religion The sincerity and fervour with which he speaks on this topic must be applauded by every candid person however differing from him on points that relate to our religious establishment  For me says this zealous and disinterested advocate for simple christianity I have determined to lay up as the best treasure and solace of a good old age if God vouchsafe it me the honest liberty of free speech from my youth where I shall think it available in so dear a concernment as the church's good  In the polemical writings of Milton there is a merit to which few polemics can pretend they were the pure dictates of conscience and produced by the sacrifice of his favourite pursuits this he has stated in the following very forcible and interesting language  Concerning therefore this wayward subject against prelaty the touching whereof is so distasteful and disquietous to a number of men as by what hath been said I may deserve of charitable readers to be credited that neither envy nor gall hath entered me upon this controversy but the enforcement of conscience only and a preventive fear lest the omitting of this duty should be against me when I would store up to myself the good provision of peaceful hours so lest it should be still imputed to be as I have found it hath been that some self pleasing humour of vain glory has incited me to contest with men of high estimation now while green years are upon my head from this needless surmisal I shall hope to dissuade the intelligent and equal auditor if I can but say successfully that which in this exigent behoves me although I would be heard only if it might be by the elegant and learned reader to whom principally for a while I shall beg leave I may address myself to him it will be no new thing though I tell him that if I hunted after praise by the ostentation of wit and learning I should not write thus out of mine own season when I have neither yet completed to my mind the full circle of my private studies although I complain not of any insufficiency to the matter in hand or were I ready to my wishes it were a folly to commit any thing elaborately composed to the careless and interrupted listening of these tumultuous times Next if I were wise only to my own ends I would certainly take such a subject as of itself might catch applause whereas this has all the disadvantages on the contrary  and such a subject as the publishing where of might be delayed at pleasure and time enough to pencil it over with all the curious touches of art even to the perfection of a faultless picture when as in this argument the not deferring is of great moment to the good speeding that if solidity have leisure to do her office art cannot have much Lastly I should not chuse this manner of writing wherein knowing myself inferior to myself led by the genial power of nature to another task I have the use as I may account but of my left hand  Prose Works vol I page  Such is the delineation that our author has given us of his own mind and motives in his treatise on Church Government which the mention of his early design to take orders has led me to anticipate  Having passed seven years in Cambridge and taken his two degrees that of batchelor in and that of master in he was admitted to the same degree at Oxford in On quitting an academical life he was according to his own testimony regretted by the fellows of his college but he regarded the house of his father as a retreat favourable to his literary pursuits and at the age of twentyfour he gladly shared the  ural retirement in which his parents ha  recently settled  Horton in Buckinghamshire here he devoted himself for five years to study with that ardour and perseverance to which as he says himself in a letter to his friend Charles Diodati his nature forcibly inclined him The letter I  m speaking of was written in the last year of his residence under the roof of his father  and exhibits a lively picture of his progress in learning his passion for virtue and his hope of renown  "To give you an account of my studies" he says "I have brought down the affairs of the Greeks in a continued course of reading to the period in which they ceased to be Greeks I have long been engaged in the obscurer parts of Italian history under the Lombards the Franks and the Germans to the time in which liberty was granted them by the emperor Rodolphus from this point I think it best to pursue in separate histories the exploits of each particular city  De studiis etiam nostris sies certior Graecorum res continuatà lectione deduximus usquequo illi Graeci esse sunt desiti Italorum u  o  cura re diu versati sumus sub Longobardis et Francis et Germanis ad illud tempus quo illis ab Rodolpho Germaniae rege concessa libertas est exinde quid quaeque civitas suo marte gesterit separatim legere praestabit  "  He shews himself in this letter most passionately attached to the Platonic philosophy "As to other points what God may have determined for me I know not but this I know that if he ever instilled an intense love of moral beauty into the breast ot any man he has instilled it into mine Ceres in the fable pursued not her daughter with a greater keenness of enquiry than I day and night the idea of perfection Hence wherever I find a man despising the false estimates of the vulgar and daring to aspire in sentiment language and conduct to what the highest wisdom through every age has taught us as most excellent to him I unite myself by a sort of necessary attachment and if I am so influenced by nature or destiny that by no exertion or labours of my own I may exalt myself to this summit of worth and honour yet no powers of heaven or earth will hinder me from looking with reverence and affection upon those who have thoroughly  attained this glory or appear engaged in the successful pursuit of it  "You enquire with a kind of solicitude even into my thoughtsHear then Diodati but let me whisper in your ear that I may not blush at my replyI think so help me Heaven of immortality You enquire also what I am about I nurse my wings and meditate a flight but my Pegasus rises as yet on very tender pinions Let us be humbly wise  De caetero quidem quid me statuerit Deus neseio illud certe  nec tanto Ceres labore ut in fabulis est liberam fertur quaesivisse siliam quanto ego hane  veluti

in which Milton pours forth his heart to the favourite friend of his youth may convince every candid reader that he possessed in no common degree two qualities very rarely united ambitious ardour of mind and unaffected modesty The poet who speaks with such graceful humility of his literary atchievements had at this time written Comus a composition that abundantly displays the variety and compass of his poetical powers After he had delineated with equal excellence the frolics  of gaiety and the triumphs of virtue passing with exquisite transition from the most sportive to the sublimest tones of poetry he might have spoken more confidently of his own productions without a particle of arrogance  We know not exactly what poems he composed during his residence at Horton The Arcades seems to have been one of his early compositions and it was intended as a compliment to his fair neighbour the accomplished Countess Dowager of Derby she was the sixth daughter of Sir John Spencer and allied to Spencer the poet who with his usual modesty and tenderness has celebrated her under the title of Amarillis At the house of this lady near Uxbridge Milton is said to have been a frequent visitor The Earl of Bridgewater before whom and by whose children Comus was represented had married a daughter of Ferdinando Earl of Derby and thus as Mr Warton observes it was for the same family that Milton wrote both the Arcades and Comus It is probable that the pleasure which the Arcades afforded to the young relations of the Countess gave rise to Comus as Lawes the musical friend of Milton in dedicating the mask to the young Lord Brackley her grandson says "this poem which received its first occasion of birth from yourself and others of your noble family and much honour from your own person in the performance"  These expressions of Lawes allude perhaps to the real incident which is said to have supplied the subject of Comus and may seem to confirm an anecdote related by Mr Warton from a manuscript of Oldys that the young and noble performers in this celebrated drama were really involved in  adventures very similar to their theatrical situation that in visiting their relations in Herefordshire they were benighted in a forest and the lady Alice Egerton actually lost  Whatever might be the origin of the mask the modesty of the youthful poet appears very conspicuous in the following words of Lawes's dedication  Although not openly acknowledged by the author yet it is a legitimate offspring so lovely and so much desired that the often copying of it hath tired my pen to give my several friends satisfaction and brought me to a necessity of producing it to the public view  Milton discovered a similar diffidence respecting his Lycidas which was written while he resided with his father in November This exquisite poem which as Mr Warton justly observes  must have been either solicited as a favour by those whom the poet had lest in his college or was a voluntary contribution of friendship sent to them from the country  appeared first in the academical collection of verses on the death of Mr Edward King and was subscribed only with the initials of its author  An animated and benevolent veteran of criticism Doctor Warton has considered a relish for the Lycidas as a test of true taste in poetry and it certainly is a test which no lover of Milton will be inclined to dispute though it must exclude from the list of accomplished critics that intemperate censor of the great poet who has endeavoured to destroy the reputation of his celebrated monody with the most insulting expressions of sarcastic contempt expressions that no reader of a spirit truly poetical can peruse without mingled  emotions of indignation and of pity But the charms of Lycidas are of a texture too firm to be annihilated by the breath of derision and though Doctor Johnson has declared the poem to be utterly destitute both of nature and of art it will assuredly continue to be admired as long as tenderness imagination and harmony are regarded as genuine sources of poetical delight  The effect of this favourite composition is exactly such as the poet intended to produce it first engages the heart with the simplicity of just and natural sorrow and then proceeds to elevate the mind with magnificent images ennobled by affectionate and devotional enthusiasm  The beauties of this pathetic and sublime monody are sufficiently obvious but the reader who compares it with a poem on the same subject by Cleveland once the popular rival of Milton may derive pleasure from perceiving how infinitely our favourite poet has excelled on this occasion an eminent antagonist  Though we find no circumstances that may ascertain the date of the Allegro and Pensoroso it seems probable that those two enchanting pictures of rural life and of the diversified delights arising from a contemplative mind were composed at Horton It was perhaps in the same situation so favourable to poetical exertions that Milton wrote the incomparable Latin poem addressed to his father There are indeed some expressions in this performance which may favour an opinion that it ought to bear an earlier date but it has such strength and manliness of sentiment as incline me to suppose it written at this period an idea that seems  almost confirmed by the lines that speak of his application to French and Italian after the completion of his classical studies  Whatever date may be assigned to it the composition deserves our particular regard since of all his poems it does the highest honour to his heart  With what energy and tenderness is his filial gratitude expressed in the following graceful exordium  Nunc mea Pierios cupiam per pectora sontes  Irriguas torquere vias totumque per ora  Volvere laxatum gemino de vertice rivum  Ut tenues oblita sonos audacibus alis  Surgat in officium v  erandi musa parentis  Hoc utcunque tibi gratum pater optime carmen  Exiguum meditatur opus nec novimus ipsi  Aptius a nobis quae possint munera donis  Respondere tuis quamvis nec maxima possint  Respondere tuis nedum ut par gratia donis  Esse queat vacuis quae redditur arida verbis  O that Picria's spring would thro' my breast  Pour it's inspiring influence and rush  No rill b  t rather an o'erflowing flood  That for my venerable father's sake  All meaner themes renounc'd my muse on wings  Of duty borne might reach a loftier strain  For thee my father howsoe'er it please  She frames this slender work nor know I aught  That may thy gifts more suitably requite  Tho' to requite them suitably would ask  Returns much nobler and surpassing far  The meagre gifts of verbal gratitude  How elegant is the praise he bestows on the musical talents of his father and how pleasing the exulting and affectionate spirit with which he speaks of their social and kindred studies  Nec tu perge precor sacras contemnere Musas  Nec vanas inopesque puta quarum ipse peritus  Munere mille sonos numeros componis ad aptos  Millibus et vocem modulis variare canoram  Doctus Arionii merito sis nominis haeres  Nunc tibi quid mirum si me genuisse poetam  Contigerit charo si tam prope sanguine

civic din to deep retreats to banks  And streams Aonian and with free consent  Didst place me happy at Apollo's side  The poet seems to have had a prophetic view of the singular calumnies that awaited his reputation and to have  anticipated his triumph over all his adversaries in the following magnanimous exclamation  Este procul vigiles curae procul este querelae  Invidiaeque acies transverso tortilis hirquo  Saeva nec anguiferos extende calumnia rictus  In me triste nihil foedissima turba potestis  Nec vestri sum juris ego securaque tutus  Pectora vinerio gradiar sublimis ab ictu  Away then sleepless care complaint away  And envy "with thy jealous leer malign"  Nor let the monster calumny shoot forth  Her venom'd tongue at me Detested foes  Ye all are impotent against my peace  For I am privileg'd and bear my breast  Safe and too high for your viperian wound  After this high ton'd burst of confidence and indignation how sweetly the poet sinks again into the tender notes of gratitude in the close of this truly filial composition  At tibi chare pater postquam non aequa merenti  Posse referre datur nec dona rependere factis  Sit memorasse satis repetitaque munere grato  Percensere animo fidaeque reponere menti  Et vos O nostri juvenilia carmina lusus  Si modo perpetuos sperare audebitis annos  Et domini superesse rogo lucemque tueri  Nec spisso rapient oblivia nigra sub orco  Forsitan has laudes decantatumque parentis  Nomen ad exemplum sero servabitis aevo  But thou my father since to render thanks  Equivalent and to requite by deeds  Thy liberality exceeds my power  Suffice it that I thus record thy gifts  And bear them treasur'd in a grateful mind  Ye too the favourite pastime of my youth  My voluntary numbers if ye dare  To hope longevity and to survive  Your master's funeral not soon absorb'd  In the oblivious Lethaean gulph  Shall to futurity perhaps convey  This theme and by these praises of my fire  Improve the fathers of a distant age  "He began now" says Johnson  to grow weary of the country and had some purpose of taking chambers in the inns of court  This weariness appears to have existed only in the fancy of his biographer During the five years that Milton resided with his parents in Buckinghamshire he had occasional lodgings in London which he visited as he informs us himself for the purpose of buying books and improving himself in mathematics and in music at that time his favourite amusements The letter which intimates his intention of taking chambers in the inns of court was not written  from the country as his biographer seems to have supposed it is dated from London and only expresses that his quarters there appeared to him awkward and inconvenient  Dicam jam nunc serio quid cogitem in hospitium juridicorum aliquod immigrare ficubi amoena et umbrosa ambulatio est quod et inter aliquot sodales commodior illic habitatio si domi manere et  quocunque libitum erit excutrere ubi nunc sum ut nosti obscurè et angustè sum    On the death of his mother who died in April and is buried in the chancel of Horton church he obtained his father's permission to gratify his eager desire of visiting the continent a permission the more readily granted perhaps as one of his motives for visiting Italy was to form a collection of Italian music  Having received some directions for his travels from the celebrated Sir Henry Wotton he went with a single servant to Paris in he was there honoured by the notice of Lord Scudamore the English ambassador who at his earnest desire gave him an introduction to Grotius then residing at Paris as the minister of Sweden  Curiosity is naturally excited by the idea of a conference between two persons so eminent and accomplished It has been conjectured that Milton might conceive his first design of writing a tragedy on the banishment of Adam from this interview with Grotius but if the Adamus Exsul of the Swedish ambassador were a subject of their discourse it is probable its author must have spoken of it but slightly as a juvenile composition since he does so in a letter to his friend Vossius in concerning a new edition of his  poetry from which he particularly excluded this sacred drama as too puerile in his own judgment to be republished  Christum patientem recudendum judico ideoque velim aliquod ejus exemplum ad me mitti ut errata typographica corrigam quando ipse nullum habeo Adami Exulis poema juvenilius est quam ut ausim addere Grotii Epist    The letters of Grotius voluminous and circumstantial as they are afford no traces of this interesting visit but they lead me to imagine that the point which the learned ambassador most warmly recommended to Milton on his departure for Italy was to pay the kindest attention in his power to the sufferings of Galileo then persecuted as a prisoner by the inquisition in Florence  In a letter to Vossius dated in the very month when Milton was probably introduced to Grotius that liberal friend to science and humanity speaks thus of Galileo "This old man to whom the universe is so deeply indebted worn out with maladies and still more with anguish of mind give us little reason to hope that his life can be long common prudence therefore suggests to us to make the utmost of the time while we can yet avail ourselves of such an instructor  Senex is optime de universo meritus morbo fractus insuper et animi aegritudine haud multum nobis vitae suae promittit quare prudentiae erit arripere tempus dum tanto doctore uti licet Grotii Epist  " Milton was of all travellers the most likely to seize a hint of this kind with avidity and expressions in Paradise Lost have led an Italian biographer of the poet to suppose that while he resided at Florence he caught from Galileo or his disciples some ideas approaching towards the Newtonian philosophy He has informed us himself that he really saw the illustrious scientific prisoner of the inquisition  and it seems not unreasonable to conclude that he was in some degree indebted to his conference with Grotius for that mournful gratification  From Paris our author proceeded to Italy embarking at Nice for Genoa After a cursory view of Leghorn and Pisa he settled for two months at Florence a city which he particularly regarded for the elegance of its language and the men of genius it had produced here as he informs us he became familiar with many persons distinguished by their rank and learning and here probably he began to form those great but unsettled projects of future composition which were to prove the sources of his glory and of which he thus speaks himself  In the private academies of Italy whither I was favoured to resort perceiving that some trifles I had in memory composed at under twenty or thereabout for the manner is that every one must give some proof of his wit and reading there met with acceptance above what was looked for and other things which I had shifted in scarcity of books and conveniency to patch up amongst them were received with written encomiums which the Italian is not forward to bestow on men of this side the Alps I began thus far to assent both to them and divers of my friends here at home and not less to an inward prompting which now grew daily upon me that by labour and intent study which I take to be my portion in this life joined with the strong propensity of nature I might perhaps leave something so written to aftertimes as they should not willingly let it die These  thoughts at once possessed me and these other that if I were certain to write as men buy leases for three lives and downward there ought no regard to be sooner had than to God's glory by the honour and instruction of my country for which cause and not only for that I knew it would be hard to arrive at the second rank among the Latins I applied myself to that resolution which Ariosto followed against the persuasions of Bembo to fix all the industry and art I could unite to the adorning of my native tongue not to make verbal curiosities the end that were a toilsome vanity but to be an interpreter and relater of the best and sagest things among mine own citizens throughout this island in the mother dialect that what the greatest and choicest wits of Athens Rome or modern Italy and those Hebrews of old did for their country I in my proportion with this over and above of being a Christian might do for mine not caring to be once named abroad though perhaps I could attain to that but content with these British islands as my world  Prose Works vol p  It is delightful to contemplate such a character as Milton thus cherishing in his own mind the seeds of future greatness and animating his youthful spirit with visions of renown that time has realized and extended beyond his most sanguine wishes  He appears on every occasion a sincere and fervent lover of his country and expresses in one of his Latin Poems the  same patriotic idea that he should be satisfied with glory confined to these Islands  Mi satis ampla  Merces et mihi grande decus sim ignotus in aevum  Tum licet externo penitusque inglorius orbi  Si me flava comas legat Usa et potor Alauni  Vorticibusque frequens Abra et nemus omne Treantae  Et Thamesis meus ante omnes et fusca metallis  Tamara et extremis me discant Orcades undis  Epitaphium Damonis  And it shall well suffice me and shall be  Fame and proud recompence enough for me  If Usa golden hair'd my verse may learn  If Alain bending o'er his crystal urn  Swift whirling Abra Trent's o'ershadow'd stream  If lovelier far than all in my esteem  Thames and the Tamar ting'd with mineral hues  And northern Orcades regard my muse  In tracing the literary ambition of Milton from the first conception of his great purposes to their accomplishment we seem to participate in the triumph of his genius which though it aspired only to the praise of these British islands is already grown an object of universal admiration and may find hereafter in the western world the amplest theatre of his glory  Dr Johnson takes occasion from the passage in which Milton speaks of the literary projects he conceived in Italy  to remark that  he had a lofty and steady confidence in himself perhaps not without some contempt of others  The latter part of this observation is evidently invidious it is completely refuted by the various commendations which the graceful and engaging manners or the poetical traveller received from the Italians a contemptuous spirit indeed appears utterly incompatible with the native disposition of Milton whose generous enthusiasm led him to conceive the fondest veneration for all who were distinguished by genius or virtue a disposition which he has expressed in the strongest terms as the reader may recollect in a letter already cited to his friend Diodati His prejudiced biographer endeavours to prove that his spirit was contemptuous by observing that he was frugal of his praise The argument is particularly defective as applied to Milton on his travels since the praises he bestowed on those accomplished foreigners who were kind to him are liberal in the highest degree and apparently dictated by the heart  After a short visit to Sienna he resided two months in Rome enjoying the most refined society which that city could afford By the favour of Holstenius the well known librarian of the Vatican whose kindness to him he has recorded in a Latin Epistle equally grateful and elegant he was recommended to the notice of Cardinal Barberini who honoured him with the most flattering attention it was at the concerts of the Cardinal that he was captivated by the charms of Leonora Baroni whose extraordinary musical powers he has celebrated in Latin verse and whom he is supposed to address as a lover in his Italian poetry The most  eloquent of the passions which is said to convert almost every man who feels it into a poet induced the imagination of Milton to try its powers in a foreign language whose difficulties he seems to have perfectly subdued by the united aids of genius and of love  His Italian sonnets have been liberally commended by natives of Italy and one of them contains a sketch of his own character so spirited and singular as to claim a place in this narrative  Giovane piano e semplicetto amante  Poi che fuggir me stesso in dubbio sono  Madonna a voi del mio cuor l' humil dono  Farò divoto io certo a prove tante  L' hebbi fedele intrepido costante  De pensieri leggiadri accorto e buono  Quando rugge il gran mondo e scocca il tuono  S' arma di se e d' intero diamante  Tanto del forse e d' invidia sicuro  Di timori e speranze al popol use  Quanto d' ingegno e d' alto valor vago  E di cetra sonora e delle muse  Sol troverete in tal parte men duro  Ove' amor mise l' insanabil ago  Enamour'd artless young on foreign ground  Uncertain whether from myself to fly  To thee dear lady with an humble sigh  Let me devote my heart which I have found  By certain proofs not few intrepid sound  Good and addicted to conceptions high  When tempest shakes the world and fires the sky  It rests in adamant self wrapt around  As safe from envy and from outrage rude  From hopes and fears that vulgar minds abuse  As fond of genius and fixt solitude  Of the resounding lyre and every muse  Weak you will find it in one only part  Now pierc'd by love's immedicable dart  It was at Rome that Milton was complimented in Latin verse by Selvaggi and Salsilli his reply to the latter then suffering from a severe malady is so remarkable for its elegance tenderness and spirit that Mr Warton praises it as one of the finest lyrical compositions which the Latin poetry of modern times can exhibit  The circumstances that happened to our author in his travels and indeed the most striking particulars of his life are related by himself in his "Second Defence" He there tells us that in passing from Rome to Naples his fellowtraveller was a hermit who introduced him to Baptista Manso Marquis of Villa an accomplished nobleman and singularly distinguished as the friend and the biographer of two eminent poets Tasso and Marini they have both left poetical memorials of their esteem for the Marquis who acquired his title as a soldier in the service of Spain but retiring early with considerable wealth to Naples his native  city he founded there a literary academy and lived in splendor as its president  This graceful and venerable hero whose politeness and learning had been fondly celebrated by Tasso in a dialogue on friendship that bears the name of Manso was near eighty when Milton become his guest he seems to have been endeared to the imagination of our poet by the liberal and affectionate tribute he had paid to the memory of his illustrious poetical friends a tribute very feelingly described by Milton in the following lines addressed to the noble and generous biographerthey speak first of Marini  Ille itidem moriens tibi soli debita vates  Ossa tibi soli supremaque vota reliquit  Nec manes pietas tua chara fefellit amici  Vidimus arridentem operoso ex aere poetam  Nec satis hoc visum est in utrumque et nec pia cessant  Officia in tumulo cupis integros rapere orco  Qua potes atque avidas Parcarum eludere leges  Amborum genus et varia sub sorte peractum  Describis vitam moresque et dona Minervae  Aemulus illius Mycalen qui natus ad altam  Rettulit Aeolii vitam facundus Homeri  To thee alone the poet would entrust  His latest vows to thee alone his dust  And thou with punctual piety hast paid  In labour'd brass thy tribute to his shade  Nor this contented thee thy zeal would save  Thy bards uninjur'd from the whelming grave  In more induring history to live  An endless life is also thine to give  And thou hast given it them and deigned to teach  The manners fortunes lives and gifts of each  Rival to him whose pen to nature true  The life of Homer eloquently drew  If the two Latin verses in which this amiable old man expressed his admiration of the young English bard deserve the name of a "sorry distich" which Johnson bestows upon them they still present Milton to our fancy in a most favourable light A traveller so little distinguished by birth or opulence would hardly have obtained such a compliment from a nobleman of Manso's experience age and dignity had he not been peculiarly formed to engage the good opinion and courtesy of strangers by the expressive comeliness of his person the elegance of his manners and the charm of his conversation  In Manso says Milton I found a most friendly guide who shewed me himself the curiosities of Naples and the palace of the Viceroy He came more than once to visit me while I continued in that city and when I left it he earnestly excused himself that although he greatly wished to render me more good offices he was unable to do so in Naples because in my religion I had disdained all disguise  Neapolim perrexi illic per eremitam quendam quìcum Romà iter federam ad Joannem Baptistam Mansum Marchionem Villensem virum nobilissimum atque gravissimum ad quem Torquatus Tassus insignis poeta Italus de amicitia scripsit sum introductus eodemque usus quamdiu illie fui sane amicissimo qui et ipse me per urbis loca et proregis aulam circumduxit et visendi gratià haud semel ipse ad hospitium venit discedenti seriò excusavit se tametsi multò plura detulisse mihi ossicia maxime cupiebat non potuisse illà in urbe propterea quod nolebam in religione esse tectiorDefensio Secunda  Pleasing and honourable as the civilities were that our young countryman received from this Nestor of Italy he has amply repaid them in a poem which to the honour of English gratitude and English genius we may justly pronounce superior to the compliments bestowed on this engaging character by the two celebrated poets who wrote in his own language and were peculiarly attached to him  Of the five sonnets indeed that Tasso addressed to his courteous and liberal friend two are very beautiful but even these are surpassed both in energy and tenderness by the following conclusion of a poem inscribed to Manso by Milton  Diis dilecte senex te Jupiter aequus oportet  Nascentem et miti lustrarit lumine Phoebus  Atlantisque nepos neque enim nisi charus ab ortu  Diis superis poterit magno favisse poetae  Hinc longaeva tibi lento sub flore senectus  Vernat et Aesonios lucratur vivida fusos  Nondum deciduos servans tibi frontis honores  Ingeniumque vigens et adultum mentis acumen  O mihi sic mea sors talem concedat amicum  Phoebaeos decorasse viros qui tam bene norit  Siquando indigenas revocabo in carmina reges  Arturumque etiam sub terris bella moventem  Aut dicam invictae sociali foedere mensae  Magnanimos heroas et O modo spiritus adsit  Frangam Saxonicas Britonum sub marte phalanges  Tandem ubi non tacitae permensus tempora vitae  Annorumque satur cineri sua jura relinquam  Ille mihi lecto madidis astaret ocellis  Astanti sat erit si dicam sim tibi curae  Ille meos artus liventi morte solutos  Curaret parva componi molliter urna  Forsitan et nostros ducat de marmore vultus  Nectens aut Paphia myrti aut Parnasside lauri  Fronde comas at ego secura pace quiescam  Tum quoque si qua fides si praemia certa bonorum  Ipse ego coelicolum semotus in aethera divum  Quo labor et mens pura vehunt atque ignea virtus  Secreti haec aliquâ mundi de parte videbo  Quantum fata sinunt et tota mente serenum  Ridens purpureo suffundar lumine vultus  Et simul aetherio plaudam mihi laetus olympo  Well may we think O dear to all above  Thy birth distinguish'd by the smile of Jove  And that Apollo shed his kindliest power  And Maia's son on that propitious hour  Since only minds so born can comprehend  A poet's worth or yield that worth a friend  Hence on thy yet unfaded cheek appears  The lingering freshness of thy greener years  Hence in thy front and features we admire  Nature unwither'd and a mind entire  O might so true a friend to me belong  So skill'd to grace the votaries of song  Should I recall hereafter into rhyme  The kings and heroes of my native clime  Arthur the chief who even now prepares  In subterraneous being future wars  With all his martial knights to be restor'd  Each to his seat around the fed'ral board  And O if spirit fail me not disperse  Our Saxon plunderers in triumphant verse  Then after all when with the past content  A life I finish not in silence spent  Should he kind mourner o'er my death bed bend  I shall but need to say "be still my friend"  He faithful to my dust with kind concern  Shall place it gently in a modest urn  He too perhaps shall bid the marble breathe  To honour me and with the graceful wreath  Or of Parnassus or the Paphian Isle  Shall bind my browsbut I shall rest the while  Then also if the fruits of faith endure  And virtue's promis'd recompence be sure  Borne to those seats to which the blest aspire  By purity of soul and virtuous fire  These rites as fate permits I shall survey  With eyes illumin'd by celestial day  And every cloud from my pure spirit driven  Joy in the bright beatitude of heaven  The preceding verses have various claims to attention they exhibit a lively picture of the literary project that occupied the mind of Milton at this period they forcibly prove with what vehemence of desire he panted for poetical  immortality and for the superior rewards of a laborious life devoted to piety and virtue  His acquaintance with Manso may be regarded as the most fortunate incident of his foreign excursion Nothing could have a greater tendency to preserve and strengthen the seeds of poetic enterprize in the mind of the young traveller than his familiarity with this eminent and engaging personage the bosom friend of Tasso the friend who had cherished that great and afflicted poet under his roof in a season of his mental calamity had restored his health reanimated his fancy and given a religious turn to the latest efforts of his majestic muse The very life of Tasso which this noble biographer had written with the copious and minute fidelity of personal knowledge and with the ardour of affectionate enthusiasm might be sufficient to give new energy to Milton's early passion for poetical renown his conversation had probably a still greater tendency to produce this effect Circumstances remote and apparently of little moment have often a marvellous influence on the works of imagination nor is it too wild a conjecture to suppose that the zeal of Manso in speaking to Milton of his departed friend might give force and permanence to that literary ambition which ultimately rendered his aspiring guest the great rival of Tasso and in the estimation of Englishmen his superior  From Naples it was the design of Milton to pass into Sicily and Greece but receiving intelligence of the civil war in England he felt it inconsistent with his principles to wander  abroad even for the improvement of his mind while his countrymen were contending for liberty at home  In preparing for his return to Rome he was cautioned against it by some mercantile friends whose letters intimated that he had much to apprehend from the machinations of English jesuits if he appeared again in that city they were incensed against him by the freedom of his discourse on topics of religion "I had made it a rule says Milton never to start a religious subject in this country but if I were questioned on my faith never to dissemble whatever I might suffer I returned nevertheless to Rome" continues the undaunted traveller "and whenever I was interrogated I attempted no disguise if any one attacked my principles I defended the true religion in the very city of the pope and during almost two months with as much freedom as I had used before By the protection of God I returned safe again to Florence revisiting friends who received me as gladly as if I had been restored to my native home  In Siciliam quoque et Graeciam trajicere volentem me tristis ex Anglia belli civilis nuntius revocavit turpe enim existimabam dum mei cives domi de libertate dimicarent ne animi causâ otiose peregrinati Romam autem reversurum monebant mercatores se didicisse per literas parari mihi ab jesuitis Anglis insidias si Romam reverterem eò quod de religione nimis liberè loquutus essem Sic enim mecum statueram de religione quidem iis in locis sermones ultro non inferre interrogatus de fide quicquid essem passurus nihil dissimulare Romam itaque nihilominus redii quid essem si quis interrogabat nemine celavi si quis adoriebatur in ipsa urbe pontificis alteros prope duos menses orthodoxam religionem ut antea liberrimè tuebar deoque sic volente incolumis Florentiam rursus perveni haud minus mei cupientes revisens ac si in patriam revertissemDesensio secunda  "  After a second residence of almost two months in Florence whence he made an excursion to Lucca a place  endeared to him by having produced the ancestors of his favourite friend Diodati he extended his travels through Bologna and Ferrara to Venice Here he remained a month and having sent hence a collection of books and particularly of music by sea he proceeded himself through Verona and Milan to Geneva In this city he was particularly gratified by the society and kindness of John Diodati uncle of his young friend whose untimely death he lamented in a Latin poem of which we shall soon have occasion to speak Returning by his former road through France he reached England at a period that seems to have made a strong impression on his mind when the king was waging in favour of episcopacy his unprosperous war with the Scots The time of Milton's absence from his native country exceeded not by his own account a year and three months  In the relation that he gives himself of his return the name of Geneva recalling to his mind one of the most slanderous of his political adversaries he animates his narrative by a solemn appeal to heaven on his unspotted integrity he protests that during his residence in foreign scenes where licentiousness was universal his own conduct was perfectly irreproachable  Quae urbs cum in mentem mihi hinc veniat Mori calumniatoris sacit ut deum hic rursus testem invocem me his omnibus in locis ubi tam multa licent ab omni flagitio ac probro integrum atque intactum vixisse illud perpetuo cogitantem si hominum latere oculos possem dei certe non posse  I dwell the more zealously on whatever may elucidate the moral character of Milton because even among those who love and revere him the splendor of the poet has in some measure eclipsed the merit of the man but in  proportion as the particulars of his life are studied with intelligence and candour his virtue will become as it ought to be the friendly rival of his genius and receive its due share of admiration and esteem Men indeed of narrow minds and of servile principles will for ever attempt to depreciate a character so absolutely the reverse of their own but liberal spirits who allow to others that freedom of sentiment which they vindicate for themselves however they disapprove or oppose the opinions of the sectary and the republican will render honourable and affectionate justice to the patriotic benevolence the industry and the courage with which Milton endeavoured to promote what he sincerely and fervently regarded as the true interest of his country  We have now attended him to the middle stage of his life at which it may not be improper to pause and make a few remarks on the years that are passed and those that are yet in prospect We behold him at the age of thirtytwo recalled to England from a foreign excursion of improvement and delight by a manly sense of what he owed to his country in a season of difficulty and danger His thoughts and conduct on this occasion are the more noble and becoming as all his preceding years had been employed in forming for the most important purposes a firm and lofty mind and in furnishing it abundantly with whatever might be useful and honourable to himself and others in the various exigencies and vicissitudes both of private and public life We have traced him through a long course of infantine academical domestic and foreign study we have seen him distinguished by application docility and genius uncommonly attached  to his instructors and most amiably grateful to his parents in friendship ardent and steady in love though tender not intemperate as a poet sensible of his rare mental endowments yet peculiarly modest in regard to his own productions enamoured of glory yet as ready to bestow as anxious to merit praise in his person and manners so fashioned to prepossess all men in his favour that even foreigners gave him credit for those high literary atchievements which were to shed peculiar lustre on his latter days and considered him already as a man of whom his country might be proud  With such accomplishments and such expectations in his behalf Milton returned to England The subsequent portion of his life however gloomy and tempestuous will be found to correspond at least in the close of it with the radiant promise of his youth We shall see him deserting his favourite haunts of Parnassus to enter the thorny paths of ecclesiastical and political dissention his principles as a disputant will be condemned and approved according to the prevalence of opposite and irreconcilable opinions that fluctuate in the world but his upright consistency of conduct deserves applause from all honest and candid men of every persuasion The Muse indeed who had blest him with singular endowments and given him so lively a sense of his being constituted a poet by nature that when he wrote not verse he had the use to borrow his own forcible expression "but of his left hand" the Muse alone might have a right to reproach him with having acted against inward conviction but could his muse have visibly appeared to reprove his desertion of her service in a parental remonstrance  he might have answered her as the young Harry of Shakespear answers the tender and keen reproof of his royal father  I will redeem all this  And in the closing of some glorious day  Be bold to tell you that I am your son  END OF THE FIRST PART  PART II  INCONCUSSA TENENS DUBIO VESTIGIA MUNDO  LUCAN  THE narrative may proceed from the information of Milton himself On his return he procured a residence in London ample enough for himself and his books and felt happy in renewing his interrupted studies  Ipse sicubi possem tam rebus turbatis fluctuantibus locum consistendi circumspiciens mihi librisque meis sat amplam in urbe domum conduxi ibi ad intermissa studia beatulus me recepi rerum exitu deo imprimis quibus id muneris populus dabat facilè permisso  This first establishment as we learn from his nephew was a lodging in St Bride's Churchyard where he received as his disciples the two sons of his sister John and Edward Philips the latter is his biographer but although he has written the life of his illustrious relation with a degree of laudable pride and affectionate spirit he does not communicate that abundance of information which might have been expected from the advantage he possessed In one article his pride has a ludicrous effect as it leads him into an awkward attempt to vindicate his uncle from the fancied opprobrium of having engaged professionally in the education of youth a profession which from its utility and importance  from the talents and virtues it requires is unquestionably entitled to respect Philips will not allow that his uncle actually kept a school as he taught only the sons of his particular friends Johnson ridicules this distinction and seems determined to treat Milton as a profest schoolmaster for the sake of attempting to prove that he did not sustain the character with advantage but adopted a vain and preposterous plan of education  "Let me not be censured" says the Doctor  as pedantic or paradoxical for if I have Milton against me I have Socrates on my side it was his labour to turn philosophy from the study of nature to speculations upon life but the innovators whom I oppose are turning off attention from life to nature they seem to think that we are placed here to watch the growth of plants or the motions of the stars Socrates was rather of opinion that what we had to learn was how to do good and avoid evil    This insidious artifice of representing Milton and Socrates as antagonists is peculiarly unfortunate since no man appears to have imbibed the principles of Socratic wisdom more deeply than our poet his regard and attachment to them is fervently expressed even in his juvenile letters the very maxims of moral truth which he is accused of counteracting never shone with more lustre than in the following passage of the Paradise Lost  But apt the mind or fancy is to rove  Uncheck'd and of her roving is no end  Till warn'd or by experience taught she learn  That not to know at large of things remote  From use obscure and subtle but to know  That which before us lies in daily life  Is the prime wisdom what is more is fume  Or emptiness or fond impertinence  And renders us in things that most concern  Unpractis'd unprepar'd and still to seek  These beautiful lines are built in some measure as Bentley has remarked upon a verse of Homer the very verse admired by Socrates which Dr Johnson has not scrupled to quote as a part of his singular illgrounded attempt to prove that Milton's ideas of education were in direct opposition to those of the great moralist of Greece an attempt that arose from a very inoffensive boast of Milton's nephew who gives a long list of books perused by the scholars of his uncle which merely proves that they read more books than are usually read in our common schools and that their diligent instructor thought it advisable for boys as they approach towards sixteen to blend a little knowledge of the sciences with their Greek and Latin  That he taught the familiar and useful doctrine of the Attic philosopher even in his lighter poetry we have a pleasing instance in the following lines of his sonnet to Syriac Skinner who was one of his scholars  To measure life learn thou betimes and know  Toward solid good what leads the nearest way  But his brief treatise addressed to Hartlib affords perhaps the best proof that his ideas of moral discipline were perfectly in unison with those of Socrates he says in that treatise  I call a complete and generous education that which fits a man to perform justly skilfully and magnanimously all the offices both private and public of peace and war  Who can define a good education in terms more truly Socratic  Milton however in his attachment to morality forgot not the claims of religion his Sundays were devoted to theology and Johnson duly praises the care with which he instructed his scholars in the primary duties of men  With a critic so sincerely devout as Johnson unquestionably was we might have hoped that the sublime piety of our author would have secured him from sarcastic attacks but we have yet to notice two insults of this kind which the acrimony of uncorrected spleen has lavished upon Milton as a preceptor  "From this wonderworking academy" says the biographer  I do not know that there ever proceeded any man very eminent for knowledge its only genuine product I believe is a small history of poetry written in Latin by his nephew of which perhaps none of my readers ever heard  The contemptuous spirit and the inaccuracy of this sarcasm are equally remarkable The scholars of Milton were far from being numerous Can it be just to speak with derision of a small academy merely because it raises no celebrated author when we consider how few of that description every nation produces We know little of those  who were under the tuition of our poet except his two nephews these were both writers and a biographer of Milton should not have utterly forgotten his obligations to Edward Philips if he allowed no credit to his brother for the spirited Latin treatise in which that young man appeared as the defender of his uncle But the striking inaccuracy of the critic consists in not giving a just account of a book that particularly claimed his attention Philips's Theatrum Poetarum a book that under a Latin title contains in English a very comprehensive list of poets ancient and modern with reflections upon many of them particularly those of our own nation It is remarkable that this book was licensed Sept just two months before the death of Milton and printed the following year The author assigns an article both to his uncle and his brother After enumerating the chief works of the former he modestly says  how far he hath revived the majesty and true decorum of heroic poesy and tragedy it will better become a person less related than myself to deliver his judgment  Though he here suppresses a desire to praise his most eminent relation it bursts forth in an amiable manner when he comes to speak of his brother for he calls him  the maternal nephew and disciple of an author of most deserved fame late deceased being the exactest of heroic poets if the truth were well examined and it is the opinion of many both learned and judicious persons either of the ancients or moderns either of our own or whatever nation else  I transcribe with pleasure this honest and simple eulogy it does credit to the intelligence and affection of the poet's disciple and it in some measure vindicates the good sense of our country by shewing that in the very year of Milton's decease when some writers have supposed that his poetical merit was almost utterly unknown there were persons in the nation who understood his full value  Let us return to the author in his little academy and the second sarcastic insult which his biographer has bestowed upon him as the master of a school The lodging in which he settled on his arrival from the continent was soon exchanged for a more spacious house and garden in Aldersgatestreet that supplied him with conveniencies for the reception of scholars on this occasion Johnson exclaims  let not our veneration for Milton forbid us to look with some degree of merriment on great promises and small performance on the man who hastens home because his countrymen are contending for their liberty and when he reaches the scene of action vapours away his patriotism in a private boardingschool  To excite merriment by rendering Milton ridiculous for having preferred the pen to the sword was an enterprise that surpassed the powers of Johnson the attempt affords a melancholy proof how far prejudice may mislead a very vigorous understanding What but the blind hatred of bigotry could have tempted one great author to deride another merely for having thought that he might serve his country more essentially by the rare and highly cultivated faculties of his mind than by the ordinary service of a  soldier But let us hear Milton on this subject We have this obligation to the malice of his contemporaries that it led him to speak publicly of himself and to relate in the most manly and explicit manner the real motives of his conduct  Speaking of the English people in the commencement of his Second Defence he says  Quos non legum contemptus aut violatio in effraenatam licentiam effudit non virtutis gloriae falsa species aut stulta veterum aemulatio inani nomine libertatis incendit sed innocentia vitae morumque sanctitas rectum atque solum iter ad libertatem veram docuit legum et religionis justissima defensio necessariò armavit Atque illi quidem Deo perinde confisi servitutem honestissimis armis pepulere cujus laudis etsi nullam partem mihi vendico a reprehensione tamen vel timiditatis vel ignaviae si qua infertur sacile me tueor Neque enim militiae labores pericula sie defugi ut non alia ratione operam multo utiliorem nec minore cum periculo meis civibus navarim animum dubiis in rebus neque demissum unquam neque ullius invidiae vel etiam mortis plus aequo metuentem praestiterim Nam cum ab adolescentulo humanioribus essem studiis ut qui maxime deditus ingenio semper quam corpore validior posthabità castrensi operà quâ me gregatius quilibet robustior sacile superasset ad ea me contuli quibus plus potui ut parte mei meliore ac potiore si saperem non deteriore ad rationes patriae causamque hanc praestantissimam quantum maxime possem momentum accederem    it was the just vindication of their laws and their religion that necessarily led them into civil war they have driven servitude from them by the most honourable arms in which praise though I can claim no personal share yet I can easily defend myself from a charge of timidity or indolence should any such be alledged against me for I have avoided the toil and danger of military life only to render my country assistance more useful and not less to my own peril exerting a mind never dejected in adversity never influenced by unworthy terrors of detraction or of death since from my infancy I had been addicted to literary pursuits and was stronger in mind than in body declining the  duties of a camp in which every muscular common man must have surpassed me I devoted myself to that kind of service for which I had the greatest ability that with the better portion of myself I might add all the weight I could to the pleas of my country and to this most excellent cause  He thus justifies on the noblest ground the line of life he pursued In the same composition he frankly states the motives which prompted him to execute each particular work that raised him to notice in his new field of controversy but before we attend to the order in which he treated various public questions that he considered of high moment to his country it is just to observe his fidelity and tenderness in first discharging as a poet the duties of private friendship  Before he quitted Florence Milton received intelligence of the loss he had to sustain by the untimely death of Charles Diodati the favourite associate of his early studies On his arrival in England the bitterness of such a loss was felt with redoubled sensibility by his affectionate heart which relieved and gratified itself by commemorating the engaging character of the deceased in a poem of considerable length entitled Epitaphium Damonis a poem mentioned by Johnson with supercilious contempt yet possessing such beauties as render it preeminent in that species of composition  Many poets have lamented a friend of their youth and a companion of their studies but no one has surpassed the affecting tenderness with which Milton speaks of his lost Diodati  Quis mihi fidus  Haerebit lateri comes ut tu saepe solebas  Frigoribus duris et per loca foeta pruinis  Aut rapido sub sole siti morientibus herbis  Pectora cui credam Quis me lenire docebit  Mordaces curas quis longam fallere noctem  Dulcibus alloquiis grato cum sibilat igni  Molle pyrum et nucibus strepitat focus et malus Auster  Miscet cuncta foris et desuper intonat ulmo  Aut aestate dies medio dum vertitur axe  Cum Pan aesculea somnum capit abditus umbra  Quis mihi blanditiasque tuas quis tum mihi risus  Cecropiosque sales referet cultosque lepores  Who now my pains and perils shall divide  As thou was won't for ever at my side  Both when the rugged frost annoy'd our feet  And when the herbage all was parch'd with heat  In whom shall I confide whose counsel find  A balmy medicine to my troubled mind  Or whose discourse with innocent delight  Shall fill me now and cheat the wintry night  While hisses on my hearth the pulpy pear  And black'ning chesnuts start and crackle there  While storms abroad the dreary scene o'erwhelm  And the wind thunders thro' the riven elm  Or who when summer suns their summit reach  And Pan sleeps hidden by the shelt'ring beech  Who then shall render me thy Attic vein  Of wit too polish'd to inflict a pain  With the spirit of a man most able to feel and most worthy to enjoy the delights of true friendship he describes the rarity of that inestimable blessing and the anguish we suffer from the untimely loss of it  Vix sibi quisque parem de millibus invenit unum  Aut si sors dederit tandem non aspera votis  Illum inopina dies qua non speraveris hora  Surripit aeternum linquens in saecula damnum  Scarce one in thousands meets a kindred mind  And if the longsought good at last he find  When least he fears it death his treasure steals  And gives his heart a wound that nothing heals  There is indeed but one effectual lenitive for wounds of this nature which Milton happily possessed in the sincerity and fervour of his religion He closes his lamentation for his favourite friend as he had closed his Lycidas with just and soothing reflections on the purity of life by which the object of his regret was distinguished and with a sublime conception of that celestial beatitude which he confidently regarded as the infallible and immediate recompence of departed virtue  Having paid what was due to friendship in his poetical capacity he devoted his pen to public affairs and entered on that career of controversy which estranged him so long and carried him so far from those milder and more engaging studies that nature and education had made the  darlings of his mind  If to sacrifice favourite pursuits that promised great glory pursuits in which acknowledged genius had qualified an ambitious spirit to excel if to sacrifice these to irksome disputes from a sense of what he owed to the exigencies of his country if such conduct deserve as it assuredly does the name of public virtue it may be as difficult perhaps to find an equal to Milton in genuine patriotism as in poetical power for who can be said to have sacrificed so much or to have shewn a firmer affection to the public good If he mistook the mode of promoting it if his sentiments both on ecclesiastical and civil policy are such as the majority of our countrymen think it just and wise to reject let us give him the credit he deserves for the merit of his intention let us respect as we ought to do the probity of an exalted understanding animated by a fervent steady and laudable desire to enlighten mankind and to render them more virtuous and happy  In the year when Milton returned to England the current of popular opinion ran with great vehemence against episcopacy He was prepared to catch the spirit of the time and to become an advocate for ecclesiastical reformation by having peculiar and domestic grounds of complaint against religious oppression His favourite preceptor had been reduced to exile and his father disinherited by intolerance  and superstition He wrote therefore with the indignant enthusiasm of a man resenting the injuries of those who are most entitled to his love and veneration The ardour of his affections conspired with the warmth of his fancy to enflame him with that puritanical zeal which blazes so intensely in his controversial productions no less than four of these were published within two years after his return and he thus speaks of the motives that led him to this species of composition in his Second Defence  "Being  Ut primum loquendi saltem caepta est libertas concedi omnia in episcopos aperiri ora alii de ipsorum vitiis alii de ipsius ordinis vitio conqueri Ad haec sane experrectus cum veram affectari viam ad libertatem cernerem ab his initiis his passibus adliberandam servitute vitam omnem mortalium rectissime procedi si ab religione disciplina orta ad mores instituta reipublicae emanaret cum etiam me ita ab adolescentia parâssem ut quid divini quid humani esset juris ante omnia possem non ignorare meque consuluissem ecquando ullius usus essem futurus si nunc patriae immo vero ecclesiae totque fratribus evangelii causâ periculo sese objicientibus deessem statui etsi tunc alia quaedam meditabar huc omne ingenium omnes industriae vires transferre Primum itaque de reformanda ecclesia Anglicana duos ad amicum quendam libros conscripsi deinde cum duo prae caeteris magni nominis episcopi suum jus contra ministros quosdam primarios asserereat ratus de iis rebus quas amore solo veritatis ex officii christiani ratione didiceram haud pejus me dicturum quam qui de suo quaestu injustissimo dominatu contendebant ad hunc libris duobus quorum unus De Episcopatu Praelatico alter De Ratione Disciplinae Ecclesiasticae inscribitur ad illum scriptis quibusdam animadversionibus mox Apologia respondi et ministris facundiam hominis ut ferebatur aegre sustinentibus suppetias tuli ab eo tempore si quid postea responderent interfui  animated by this universal outcry against the bishops as I perceived that men were taking the true road to liberty and might proceed with the utmost rectitude from these beginnings to deliver human life from all base subjection if their discipline drawing its source from religion proceeded to morals and political institutions as I had been trained from my youth to the particular knowledge of what belonged to divine and what to human jurisdiction and as  I thought I should deserve to forfeit the power of being useful to mankind if I now failed to assist my country and the church and so many brethren who for the sake of the gospel were exposing themselves to peril I resolved though my thoughts had been preengaged by other designs to transfer to this object all my talents and all my application first therefore I wrote of reformation in England two books addressed to a friend afterwards when two bishops of eminence had asserted their cause against the leading ministers of the opposite party as I conceived that I could argue from a love of truth and a sense of christian duty not less forcibly than my antagonists who contended for lucre and their own unjust dominion I answered one of them in two books with the following titles Of Prelatical Episcopacy Of Church Government and the other first in Animadversions upon the Remonstrants Defence against Smectymnuus and secondly in my Apology As the ministers were thought hardly equal to their opponent in eloquence I lent them my aid and from that time if they made any farther reply I was a party concerned"  I have inserted this passage at full length because it gives us a clear insight into the motives of Milton on his first engaging in controversy and discovers the high opinion which he entertained both of the christian purity and the argumentative powers of his own cultivated mind the two bishops to whom he alludes were Hall bishop of Norwich famous as our first satirist and the learned Usher primate of Ireland Hall published in "An humble Remonstrance to the High Court of Parliament in Behalf of Episcopacy"  an answer to this appeared written by six ministers under the title of Smectymnuus a word casually formed from the initial letters of their respective names This little band of religious writers included Thomas Young the beloved preceptor of Milton so that personal attachment conspired with public enthusiasm to make our author vehement in his reply to the two bishops who failed not to encounter the confederate antagonists of their order He probably recollected the sufferings of his favourite instructor when he exclaimed in his treatise of reformation "What numbers of faithful and free born Englishmen and good christians have been constrained to forsake their dearest home their friends and kindred whom nothing but the wide ocean or the savage deserts of America could hide and shelter from the fury of the bishops"  However furious the persecution might be which excited antipathy and abhorrence in Milton against the order of bishops it must be confessed that he frequently speaks with that intemperance of zeal which defeats its own purpose There are some passages in his controversial writings that must be read with concern by his most passionate admirers yet even the gloom and severity of these are compensated by such occasional flashes of ardent fancy of sound argument and of sublime devotion as may extort commendation even from readers who love not the author  In his first Ecclesiastical Treatise of Reformation he makes the following very solemn appeal to heaven on his integrity as a writer  And here withal I invoke the immortal deity revealer and judge of secrets that wherever I have  in this book plainly and roundly though worthily and truly laid open the faults and blemishes of fathers martyrs or christian emperors or have otherways inveighed against error and superstition with vehement expressions I have done it neither out of malice nor list to speak evil nor any vain glory but of mere necessity to vindicate the spotless truth from an ignominious bondage  Towards the close of this performance he gives a distant mysterious hint of his great and unsettled poetical designs with a very striking mixture of moral political and religious enthusiasm  Then amidst the hymns and hallelujahs of saints some one may perhaps be heard offering at high strains  in new and lofty measures  to sing and celebrate thy divine mercies and marvellous judgments in this land throughout all ages  In his subsequent work on the Reason of Church Government he gratifies us with a more enlarged view of his literary projects not yet moulded into form but like the unarranged elements of creation now floating at large in his capacious mind  I transcribe the long passage alluded to because it illustrates the mental character of Milton with a mild energy a solemn splendor of sentiment and expression peculiar to himself  Time serves not now and perhaps I might seem too profuse to give any certain account of what the mind at home in the spacious circuits of her musing hath liberty to propose to herself though of highest hope and hardest  attempting whether that epic form whereof the two poems of Homer and those other two of Virgil and Tasso are a diffuse and the book of Job a brief model or whether the rules of Aristotle herein are strictly to be kept or nature to be followed which in them that know art and use judgment is no transgression but an enriching of art and lastly what king or knight before the Conquest might be chosen in whom to lay the pattern of a christian hero And as Tasso gave to a prince of Italy his choice whether he would command him to write of Godfrey's expedition against the infidels Belisarius against the Goths or Charlemain against the Lombards if to the instinct of nature and the emboldning of art aught may be trusted and that there be nothing adverse in our climate or the fate of this age it haply would be no rashness from an equal diligence and inclination to present the like offer in our antient stories Or whether those dramatic constitutions wherein Sophocles and Euripides reign shall be found more doctrinal and exemplary to a nationOr if occasion shall lead to imitate those magnific odes and hymns wherein Pindarus and Callimachus are in most things worthy But those frequent songs throughout the law and prophets beyond all these not in their divine argument alone but in the very critical art of composition may be easily made appear over all the kinds of lyric poesy to be incomparable These abilities wheresoever they be found are the inspired gift of God rarely bestowed but yet to some though most abuse in every nation and are of power besides the office of a pulpit  to inbreed and cherish in a great people the seeds of virtue and public civility to allay the perturbations of the mind and set the affections in right tune to celebrate in glorious and lofty hymns the throne and equipage of God's almightiness and what he works and what he suffers to be wrought with high providence in his church to sing victorious agonies of martyrs and saints the deeds and triumphs of just and pious nations doing valiantly through faith against the enemies of Christ to deplore the general relapses of kingdoms and states from justice and God's true worship Lastly whatsoever in religion is holy and sublime in virtue amiable or grave whatsoever hath passion or admiration in all the changes of that which is called fortune from without or the wily subtleties and refluxes of man's thoughts from within all these things with a solid and treatable smoothness to paint out and describe teaching over the whole book of sanctity and virtue through all the instances of example with such delight to those especially of soft and delicious temper who will not so much as look upon truth herself unless they see her elegantly drest that whereas the paths of honesty and good life appear now rugged and difficult though they be indeed easy and pleasant they will then appear to all men both easy and pleasant though they were rugged and difficult indeed  The thing which I had to say and those intentions which have lived within me ever since I could conceive myself any thing worth to my country I return to crave excuse that urgent reason hath pluckt from me by an  abortive and foredated discovery and the accomplishment of them lies not but in a power above man's to promise but that none hath by more studious ways endeavoured and with more unwearied spirit that none shall that I dare almost aver of myself as far as life and free leisure will extend Neither do I think it shame to covenant with any knowing reader that for some few years yet I may go on trust with him toward the payment of what I am now indebted as being a work not to be raised from the heat of youth or the vapours of wine like that which flows at waste from the pen of some vulgar amourist or the trencher fury of a rhyming parasite nor to be obtained by the invocation of dame Memory and her siren daughters but by devout prayer to that eternal spirit who can enrich with all utterance and knowledge and sends out his Seraphim with the hallowed fire of his altar to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases to this must be added industrious and select reading steady observation insight into all seemly and generous arts and affairs till which in some measure be compassed at mine own peril and cost I refuse not to sustain this expectation from as many as are not loth to hazard so much credulity upon the best pledges that I can give them Although it nothing content me to have disclosed thus much before hand but that I trust hereby to make it manifest with what small willingness I endure to interrupt the pursuit of no less hopes than these and leave a calm and pleasing solitariness fed with chearful and confident thoughts to embark in a troubled sea of noise and hoarse  disputes put from beholding the bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still air of delightful studies  Mr Warton who has cited the last sentence of this very interesting passage as a proof that Milton then engaged in controversy sighed for his more congenial pursuits laments  that the vigorous portion of his life that those years in which imagination is on the wing were unworthily and unprofitably wasted on temporary topics  Many lovers of poetry will sympathise with this amiable writer in his regret but others may still entertain very different sensations on the subject Allowing for a moment that the controversial writings of Milton deserve to be neglected and forgotten reasons may yet be found to rejoice rather than lament that he exerted his faculties in composing them The occupation however it might suspend his poetical enterprizes cherished the ardour and energy of his mind and above all confirmed in him that well founded and upright selfesteem to which we are principally indebted for his sublimest production The works I allude to were in his own estimation indispensable and meritorious had he not written them as he frankly informs us  he would have heard within himself all his life after of discourage and reproach  Nothing perhaps but this retrospect on a life passed as his own conscience assured him in the faithful discharge of arduous and irksome duties could have afforded to the declining days of Milton that confident vigour of mind that intense and inextinguishable fire of imagination which gave existence and perfection to his Paradise Lost  He appears to have thought with a celebrated ancient that perfect morality is necessary to the perfection of genius and that sublimity in composition may be expected only from the man who has attained the sublime in the steady practice of virtue  These noble and animating ideas seem to have had great influence on his conduct very early in life for in speaking of the studies and sentiments of his youth he says  I was confirmed in this opinion that he who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter in laudable things ought himself to be a true poem that is a composition and pattern of the honourablest things not presuming to sing high praises of heroic men or famous cities unless he have in himself the experience and the practice of all that which is praise worthy  In reply to the absurd charge of his leading a dissolute life he gives an engaging and spirited account of his domestic conduct  Those morning haunts are where they should be at home not sleeping or concocting the surfeits of an irregular feast but up and stirring in winter often ere the sound of any bell awake men to labour or to devotion in summer as oft with the bird that first rouses or not much tardier to read good authors or cause them to be read till the attention be weary or memory have its full fraught then with useful and generous labours preserving the body's health and hardiness to render lightsome clear and not lumpish obedience to the mind  Had the prose works of Milton no merit but that of occasionally affording us little sketches of his sentiments his manners and occupations they would on this account be highly valuable to every reader whom a passionate admiration of the poet has induced to wish for all possible acquaintance with the man To gratify such readers I select very copiously from his various works those passages that display in the strongest point of view his moral and domestic character It is my firm belief that as this is more known it will become more and more an object of affection and applause yet I am far from surveying it with that blind idolatry which sees no defect or with that indiscreet partiality which labours to hide the failing it discovers a biographer must have ill understood the nature of Milton who could suppose it possible to gratify his spirit by homage so unworthy for my own part I am persuaded his attachment to truth was as sincere and fervent as that of the honest Montaigne who says  I would come again with all my heart from the other world to give any one the lie who should report me other than I was though he did it to honour me  I shall not therefore attempt to deny or to excuse the fatiguing heaviness or the coarse asperity of his ecclesiastical disputes The sincerest friends of Milton may here agree with Johnson who speaks of his controversial merriment as disgusting but when the critic adds such is his malignity that "Hell grows darker at his frown" they must abhor  this base misapplication I had almost said this profanation of Miltonic verse  In a controversial treatise that gave rise to such an imputation we should expect to find the polemic savagely thirsting for the blood of his adversaries it is just the reverse Milton's antagonist had indeed suggested to the public with  infernal malignity  that he was a miscreant  who ought in the name of Christ to be stoned to death  This antagonist as Milton supposed was a son of bishop Hall" and scrupled not to write thus outrageously against one who to use the milder words of our author  in all his writing spake not that any man's skin should be razed  "The style of his piece" says Johnson in speaking of this apology  is rough and such perhaps is that of his antagonist  The different degrees of roughness that the two writers displayed give a singular effect to this observation of the critic who confounds the coarse and intemperate vehemence of the one with the outrageous barbarity of the other Milton sometimes wrote with the unguarded and ungraceful asperity of a man in wrath but let equity add that when he did so he was exasperated by foes who exerted against him all the persecuting ferocity of a fiend  The incidents of his life were calculated to put his temper and his fortitude to the most arduous trials and in the severest of these he will be found constant and exemplary in the exercise of gentle and beneficent virtue From the thorns of controversy he was plunged into the still sharper thorns of connubial dissension During the Whitsuntide of  the year at the age of thirtyfive he married Mary the daughter of Richard Powell a gentleman who resided at Forest Hill near Shotover in Oxfordshire This illstarr'd union might arise from an infantine acquaintance as the grandfather of Milton had probably lived very near the seat of the Powells What led to the connection we can only conjecture but we know it was unhappy as the lady after living only a few weeks with her husband in London deserted him under the decent pretence of passing the summer months on a visit to her father with whom the indulgent poet gave her permission to remain till Michaelmas during the interval he was engaged in kind attention to his father whom he now established under his own roof The old man had been settled at Reading with his younger son Christopher a lawyer and a royalist but thought it expedient to quit that place on its being taken by Essex the parliamentary general and found a comfortable asylum for the residue of his long life in the filial piety and tender protection of the poet  At the time appointed Milton solicited the return of his wife she did not condescend even to answer his letter he repeated his request by a messenger who to the best of my remembrance says Philips reported that he was dismissed with some sort of contempt This proceeding in all probability continues the biographer whose situation made him the best judge of occurrences so extraordinary was grounded  upon no other cause but this namely that the family being generally addicted to the cavalier party as they called it and some of them possibly engaged in the  king's service who by this time had his headquarters at Oxford and was in some prospect of success they began to repent them of having matched the eldest daughter of the family to a person so contrary to them in opinion and thought it would be a blot in their escutcheon whenever that Court came to flourish again however it so incensed our author that he thought it would be dishonourable ever to receive her again after such a repulse  Milton had too tender and too elevated a spirit not to feel this affront with double poignancy as it affected both his happiness and his dignity but it was one of his noble characteristics to find his mental powers rather invigorated than enfeebled by injury and affliction he thought it the prerogative of wisdom to find remedies against every evil however unexpected by which vice or infirmity can embitter life In reflecting on his immediate domestic trouble he conceived the generous design of making it subservient to the public good He found that in discordant marriage there is misery for which he thought there existed a very easy remedy and perfectly consistent both with reason and religion with these ideas he published in the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce He addresses the work to the Parliament with great spirit and eloquence and after asserting the purity of his precepts and the beneficence of his design he says with patriotic exultation  let not England forget her precedence of teaching nations how to live  Sanguine as Milton was in the hope of promoting the virtue and happiness of private life by this publication the Presbyterian clergy notwithstanding their past obligations to the author endeavoured to persecute him for the novelty and freedom of his sentiments" The assembly of divines  sitting at Westminster impatient says Antony Wood of having the clergy's jurisdiction as they reckoned it invaded did instead of answering or disproving what those books had asserted cause him to be summoned before the House of Lords but that house whether approving the doctrine or not favouring his accusers did soon dismiss him  Milton whom no opposition could intimidate when he believed himself engaged in the cause of truth and justice endeavoured to support his doctrine by subsequent publications first "The Judgment of Martin Bucer concerning Divorce" this also he addresses to the Parliament and says with his usual spirit  God it seems intended to prove me whether I durst alone take up a rightful cause against a world of disesteem and found I durst My name I did not publish as not willing it should sway the reader either for me or against me but when I was told that the stile which what it ails to be so soon distinguishable I cannot tell was known by most men and that some of the clergy began to inveigh and exclaim on what I was credibly informed they had not read I took it then for my proper season both to shew them a name that could easily contemn such an indiscreet kind of censure and to reinforce the question with a more accurate diligence that if any of them would be so good as to  leave railing and to let us hear so much of his learning and christian wisdom as will be strictly demanded of him in his answering to this problem care was had he should not spend his preparations against a nameless pamphlet  These expressions display the frankness and fortitude of a noble mind perfectly conscious of its own integrity in discussing a very delicate point that materially affects the comfort of human life This integrity he had indeed protested very solemnly in his former Address to the Parliament where after asserting that the subject concerned them chiefly as redressers of grievances he proceeds thus  Me it concerns next having with much labour and faithful diligence first found out or at least with a fearless communicative candour first published to the manifest good of christendom that which calling to witness every thing mortal and immortal I believe unfeignedly to be true  The solemnity of this protestation confirmed as it was by the singular regularity of his morals and the sincerity of his zeal as a christian could not secure him from censures of every kind which vehement as they were he seems to have despised His ideas were derided by libertines and calumniated by hypocrites and bigots but superior to ridicule and to slander he proceeded resolutely in what he thought his duty by shewing how completely his doctrine was consonant in his own opinion to that gospel which he had sedulously made not only the favourite study but the constant guide of his life With this view he published in his Tetrachordon expositions upon the four chief places of  scripture which speak of marriage He introduces this work by a third Address to the Parliament and speaking of their justice and candour in disdaining to think of persecuting him for his doctrine according to the instigation of his enemies he expresses his gratitude in the following animated terms  For which uprightness and incorrupt refusal of what ye were incensed to lords and commons though it were done to justice not to me and was a peculiar demonstration how far your ways are different from the rash vulgar besides those allegiances of oath and duty which are my public debt to your public labours I have yet a store of gratitude laid up which cannot be exhausted and such thanks perhaps they may live to be as shall more than whisper to the next ages  This sentence is remarkable in various points of view but chiefly as it shews us that the peculiar eagerness and energy with which Milton at a future period defended the parliament originated not only in his passionate attachment to freedom but in his ardent sense of personal gratitude to the legislature of his country He was however too magnanimous to wish for shelter under any authority without vindicating his innocence and the merit of his cause he therefore says to the parliament in speaking of an antagonist who in their presence had traduced him from the pulpit  I shall take licence by the right of nature and that liberty wherein I was born to defend myself publicly against a printed calumny and do willingly appeal to those judges to whom I am accused  The preacher had represented the doctrine of divorce as a wicked book for allowing other causes of divorce than Christ and his Apostles mentioned and the parliament as sinners for not punishing its authors  This induces Milton to exclaim with devotional spirit which seems predominant in his mind upon every occasion  First lords and commons I pray to that God before whom ye then were prostrate so to forgive ye those omissions and trespasses which ye desire most should find forgiveness as I shall soon shew to the world how easily ye absolve yourselves of that which this man calls your sin and is indeed your wisdom and nobleness whereof to this day ye have done well not to repent  The scope of Milton in his doctrine of divorce is thus explained by himself  This shall be the task and period of this discourse to prove first that other reasons of divorce besides adultery were by the law of Moses and are yet to be allowed by the Christian magistrate as a piece of justice and that the words of Christ are not hereby contraried next that to prohibit absolutely any divorce whatsoever except those which Moses excepted is against the reason of law  This doctrine he first delivered as the result of his own diligent study of the scripture He afterwards found and declared it consonant to what many eminent divines of the reformed church particularly Martin Bucer and Erasmus had maintained lastly to grace his opinions with the highest human support he asserts  they were sanctioned by the whole assembled authority of England both church  and state and in those times which are on record for the purest and sincerest that ever shone yet on the Reformation of this land the time of Edward the Sixth That worthy prince having utterly abolished the canon law out of his dominions as his father did before him appointed by full vote of parliament a committee of two and thirty chosen men divines and lawyers of whom Cranmer the archbishop Peter Martyr and Walter Haddon not without the assistance of Sir John Cheek the king's tutor a man at that time accounted the learnedest of Englishmen and for piety not inferior were the chief to frame anew some ecclesiastical laws that might be instead of what was abrogated The work with great diligence was finished and with as great approbation of that reforming age was received and had been doubtless as the learned preface thereof testifies established by act of parliament had not the good king's death so soon ensuing arrested the farther growth of religion also from that season to this Those laws thus sounded on the memorable wisdom and piety of that religious parliament and synod allow divorce and second marriage not only for adultery and desertion but for any capital enmity or plot laid against the other's life and likewise for evil and fierce usage Nay the twelfth chapter of that title by plain consequence declares that lesser contentions if they be perpetual may obtain divorce which is all one really with the position by me held in the former treatise published on this argument herein only differing that there the cause of perpetual strife was put for example in the  unchangeable discord of some natures but in these laws intended us by the best of our ancestors the effect of continual strife is determined no unjust plea of divorce whether the cause be natural or wilful  The author exults so much in this authority that he concludes with the following expressions of confidence and triumph  Henceforth let them who condemn the assertion of this book for new and licentious be sorry lest while they think to be of the graver sort and take on them to be teachers they expose themselves rather to be pledged up and down by men who intimately know them to the discovery and contempt of their ignorance and presumption  I have dwelt the longer on this subject because it occupied so deeply the mind and heart of Milton In these treatises the energy of his language is very striking it forcibly proves how keenly he felt the anguish of connubial infelicity and how ardently he laboured to remove from himself and others that "secret affliction" to use one of his own expressive phrases  of an unconscionable size to human strength  He argues indeed for what the majority of modern legislators and divines have thought inconsistent with sound morality and true religion but they who deem his arguments inconclusive may yet admire the powers and the probity of the advocate His view of the question is as extensive and liberal as his intention was pure and benevolent if a few words of our Saviour in their literal sense are  against him the spirit of the gospel may be thought by sincere Christians to allow him all the latitude for which he contends the most rigid opponent of his doctrine may be frequently charmed with his rich vein of fervid eloquence and christian philanthropy  His three publications on divorce were followed by Colasterion a reply to a nameless answer against his doctrine This work is an angry invective in which he endeavours but not happily to overwhelm his antagonist with ridicule  In the account which he gives of his own compositions in his Second Defence he speaks of his treatise on divorce as forming a part of his progressive labour to vindicate liberty in various points of view he considered it in three different shapes ecclesiastical domestic and civil he thought it of high moment to establish a more enlarged system of domestic liberty at a time when connubial discord was so common in consequence of civil dissension when to use his own forcible expression alluding probably to his particular situation  the wife might be found in the camp of the enemy threatening ruin and slaughter to her husband  He seems to exult in saying that his doctrine of divorce was more abundantly demonstrated about two years after his publication by the illustrious Selden in his Uxor Hebraea  Cum itaque tres omnino

Those who love not Milton affect to speak scornfully of his writings on this subject and intimate that they were received at first with universal contempt but this was far from being the case they were applauded by many on whose judgment the author set the highest value though they were made a source of indecent mirth by the vulgar and we may reasonably conclude it was this circumstance that induced him to wish he had written them in Latin To the low ribaldry with which they were attacked he alludes in the sonnet celebrated for the following admirable lines on the hypocritical or intemperate assertors of liberty  That bawl for freedom in their senseless mood  And full revolt when truth would set them free  Licence they mean when they cry liberty  For who loves that must first be wise and good  This noble sentiment he has inculcated more than once in prose and as his life was in harmony with his precept it might have taught his enemies to avoid the gross absurdity of representing him as the lover of anarchy and confusion  Never was a mind better constituted than Milton's to set a just value on the prime blessings of peace and order if he ran into political errors they arose not from any fondness for scenes of turbulence but rather from his generous credulity respecting the virtue of mankind from believing that many hypocrites who affected a wish to establish peace and order in his country on what he esteemed the surest foundation were as sincere and disinterested as himself  From this time says Johnson it is observed that he became an enemy to the Presbyterians whom he had favoured before He that changes his party by his humour is not much more virtuous than he that changes it by his interest he loves himself rather than truth  Notwithstanding the air of morality in this remark it may be questioned if ever an observation was made on any great character more invidious or more unjust When the Presbyterians were favoured by Milton they spake the language of the oppressed on their being invested with power they forgot their own pleas for liberty of conscience and became in their turn persecutors it was the consistency of virtue therefore in Milton that made him at one time their advocate and at another their opponent so far from loving himself better than truth he was perhaps of all mortals the least selfishHe contended for religion without seeking emoluments from the church he contended for the state without aiming at any civil or military employment truth and justice were the idols of his heart and the study of his life if he sometimes failed of attaining them it was not because he loved any thing better it was because he overshot  the object of his sincere affection from the fondness and ardour of his pursuit  His wife still persisted in her desertion but he amused his mind under the mortification her conduct had occasioned by frequent visits to the Lady Margaret Ley whose manners and conversation were peculiarly engaging Her father the Earl of Marlborough had held the highest offices in a former reign and of his virtues she used to speak with such filial eloquence as inspired Milton with a sonnet in her praise  He continued also to manifest his firm affection to the public good by two compositions intended to promote it the little tractate on education addressed to Mr Hartlib who had requested his thoughts upon that interesting subject and his Areopagitica a speech for the liberty of unlicenced printing The latter has been reprinted with a spirited preface by Thomson a poet whom a passion for freedom united to genius had highly qualified as an editor and eulogist of Milton  Had the author of the Paradise Lost left us no composition but his Areopagitica he would be still entitled to the affectionate veneration of every Englishman who exults in that intellectual light which is the noblest characteristic of his country and for which England is chiefly indebted to the liberty of the press Our constant advocate for freedom in every department of life vindicated this most important privilege with a mind fully sensible of its value he poured all his heart into this vindication and to speak of his work in his own energetic language we may justly  call it what he has defined a good book to be  the precious lifeblood of a master spirit embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life  His late biographer instead of praising Milton for a service so honourably rendered to literature seems rather desirous of annihilating its merit by directing his sarcastic animosity against the liberty of the press  It seems not more reasonable  says Johnson  to leave the right of printing unrestrained because writers may be afterwards censured than it would be to sleep with doors unbolted because by our laws we can hang a thief  This is servile sophistry the author's illustration of a thief may be turned against himself To suffer no book to be published without a licence is tyranny as absurd as it would be to suffer no traveller to pass along the highway without producing a certificate that he is not a robber  Even bad books may have their use as Milton observes and I mention this observation chiefly to shew how liberally he introduces a just compliment to a great author of his own time in support of this idea "What better witness" says the advocate for unlicenced printing  can ye expect I should produce than one of your own now sitting in parliament the chief of learned men reputed in this land Mr Selden whose volume of natural and national laws proves not only by great authorities brought together but by exquisite reasons and theorems almost mathematically demonstrative that all opinions yea errors known read and collated are of main service and assistance towards the speedy attainment of what is truest  This  eulogy alone appears sufficient to refute a remark unfriendly to Milton that he was frugal of his praise such frugality will hardly be found united to a benevolent heart and a glowing imagination  In his early poems both English and Latin were first published in a little volume by Humphry Mosely who informs the reader in his advertisement that he had obtained them by solicitation from the author regarding him as a successful rival of Spencer  Milton had now passed more than three years in that singular state of mortification which the disobedience of his wife occasioned His time had been occupied by the incessant exercise of his mental powers but he probably felt with peculiar poignancy  A craving void left aching in the breast  As he entertained serious thoughts of enforcing by his own example his doctrine of divorce and of marrying another wife who might be worthy of the title he paid his addresses to the daughter of Doctor Davies the father seems to have been a convert to Milton's arguments but the lady had scruples She possessed according to Philips both wit and beauty A novelist could hardly imagine circumstances more singularly distressing to sensibility than the situation of the poet if as we may reasonably conjecture he was deeply enamoured of this lady if her father was inclined to accept him as a soninlaw and if the object of his love had no inclination to reject his suit but what arose from a dread of his being indissolubly united to another  Perhaps Milton alludes to what he felt on this occasion in those affecting lines of Paradise Lost where Adam prophetically enumerating the miseries to arise from woman says in closing the melancholy list that man sometimes  His happiest choice too late  Shall meet already link'd and wedlockbound  To a fell adversary his hate or shame  Which infinite calamity shall cause  To human life and household peace confound  However strong the scruples of his new favourite might have been it seems not improbable that he would have triumphed over them had not an occurrence which has the air of an incident in romance given another turn to the emotions of his heart While he was conversing with a relation whom he frequently visited in St Martin'slane the door of an adjoining apartment was suddenly opened he beheld his repentant wife kneeling at his feet and imploring his forgiveness After the natural struggles of honest pride and just resentment he forgave and received her  partly from the intercession of their common friends and partly  says his nephew  from his own generous nature more inclinable to reconciliation than to perseverance in anger and revenge  Fenton justly remarks that the strong impression which this interview must have made on Milton  contributed much to the painting of that pathetic scene in Paradise Lost in which Eve addresses herself to Adam for pardon  and peace  the verses charming as they are acquire new charms when we consider them as descriptive of the poet himself and the penitent destroyer of his domestic comfort  Her lowly plight  Immovable till peace obtain'd from fault  Acknowledg'd and deplor'd in Adam wrought  Commiseration soon his heart relented  Towards her his life so late and sole delight  Now at his feet submissive in distress  Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking  His counsel whom she had displeas'd his aid  As one disarm'd his anger all he lost  It has been said that Milton resembled his own Adam in the comeliness of his person but he seems to have resembled him still more in much nobler endowments and particularly in uniting great tenderness of heart to equal dignity of mind Soon after he had pardoned and lived again with his wife he afforded an asylum in his own house to both her parents and to their numerous family They were active royalists and fell into great distress by the ruin of their party these were the persons who had not only treated Milton with contemptuous pride but had imbittered his existence for four years by instigating his wife to persist in deserting him The mother as Wood intimates was his greatest enemy and occasioned the perverse conduct of her daughter The father though sumptuous in his mode of life when he first received Milton as his soninlaw had  never paid the marriage portion of a thousand pounds according to his agreement and was now stript of his property by the prevalence of the party he had opposed On persons thus contumelious and culpable towards him Milton bestowed his favour and protection Can the records of private life exhibit a more magnanimous example of forgiveness and beneficence  At the time of his wife's unexpected return he was preparing to remove from Aldersgate to a larger house in Barbican with a view of increasing the number of his scholars It was in this new mansion that he received the forgiven penitent and provided a refuge for her relations whom he retained under his roof according to Fenton  till their affairs were accommodated by his interest with the victorious party  They left him soon after the death of his father who ended a very long life in the year and not without the gratification peculiarly soothing to an affectionate old man of bestowing his benediction on a grandchild for within the year of Milton's reunion with his wife his family was increased by a daughter Anne the eldest of his children born July th  When his apartments were no longer occupied by the guests whom he had so generously received he admitted more scholars but their number was small and Philips imagines that he was induced to withdraw himself from the business of education by a prospect of being appointed adjutant general in Sir William Waller's army whatever might have been the motive for his change of life he quitted  his large house in Barbican for a smaller in Holborn  among those says his nephew that open backwards into Lincoln's Inn Fields  where he lived according to the same author in great privacy and perpetually engaged in a variety of studies  Three years elapsed without any new publication from his pen a silence which the various affecting occurrences in his family would naturally produce In he published The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates and in his summary account of his own writings he relates the time and occasion of this performance He declares that without any personal malevolence against the deceased monarch who had been tried and executed before this publication appeared it was written to compose the minds of the people disturbed by the duplicity and turbulence of certain presbyterian ministers who affected to consider the sentence against the king as contrary to the principles of every protestant church  a falsehood says Milton which without inveighing against Charles I refuted by the testimony of their most eminent theologians  Tum verò tandem cùm presbyteriani quidam ministri Carolo priùs infellissimi nunc independentium partes suis anteferri et in senatu plus posse indignantes parliamenti sententiae de rege latae non facto irati sed quod ipsorum factio non

Irish papists appeared in the same year a performance that he probably thought too inconsiderable to enumerate in his own account of what he had published it includes however some remarkably keen strictures on a letter written by Ormond to tempt Colonel Jones the governor of Dublin to desert the Parliament who had intrusted him with his command Ormond having imputed to the prevailing party in England a design to establish a perfect Turkish tyranny Milton with great dexterity turns the expression against Ormond observing that the design of bringing in that tyranny is a monarchical design and not of those who have dissolved monarchy  Witness says he that consultation had in the court of France under Charles the IXth at Blois wherein Poncet a certain court projector brought in secretly by the chancellor Biragha after many praises of the Ottoman government proposes ways and means at large in the presence of the king the queen regent and Anjou the king's brother how with best expedition and least noise the Turkish tyranny might be set up in France  I transcribe the passage as an example of Milton's applying historical anecdotes with peculiar felicity  He now began to employ himself in one of the great works with which he hoped to enrich his native language The sketch that he has drawn of himself and his studies at this period is so interesting and honourable that it would  be injurious not to translate the Latin expressions to which I allude  Hanc intra privatos parietes meam operam nunc ecclesiae nunc reipublicae gratis dedi mihi vicissim vel haec vel illa

as a private citizen I gratuitously gave my assistance to the church and state on me in return they bestowed only the common benefit of protection but my conduct assuredly gave me a good conscience a good reputation among good men and this honourable freedom of discourse others have been busy in drawing to themselves unmerited emoluments and honour no one has ever beheld me soliciting any thing either in person or by my friends I have confined myself much at home and by my own property though much of it has been withheld from me in this civil tumult I have supported life however sparingly and paid a tax imposed upon me not in the most equitable proportion  Having now a prospect of abundant leisure I directed my studies to the history of my country which I began from its remotest source and intended to bring down if possible in a regular process to the present times I  had executed four books when on the settlement of the republic the council of state then first established by the authority of parliament called me most unexpectedly to its service and wished to employ me chiefly in its foreign concerns  It has not yet I believe been ascertained to whom Milton was particularly indebted for a public appointment  He was says Wood without any seeking of his by the endeavours of a private acquaintance who was a member of the new council of state chosen Latin secretary  The new council consisted of thirtynine members including two persons whom we may suppose equally inclined to promote the interest of Milton these were Serjeant Bradshaw and Sir Harry Vane the younger it seems probable that he owed his station of secretary to the former since in his Second Defence he mentions him as a friend entitled to his particular regard and draws his character in colours so vivid that the portrait may be thought worthy of preservation even by those who have no esteem for the original  The character of a man so extraordinary derived from personal intimacy and delineated by a hand so powerful can hardly fail to be interesting yet it becomes still more so if we consider it as a monument of Milton's gratitude to the friend who fixed him in that public station which gave signal exercise to the energy of his mind and first made him as a Latin writer the admiration of Europe  Whatever influence gratitude might have on the description and however different the ideas may be that are commonly entertained of Bradshaw the eulogy bestowed on him  by Milton was certainly sincere for though not frugal of his praise yet such was his probity that it may I think be fairly proved he never bestowed a particle of applause where he did not think it deserved a point that I hope to establish by refuting in the course of this narrative the charge of servile flattery which he is falsely accused of having lavished upon Cromwell  To praise indeed appears to have been an occupation peculiarly suited to his spirit which was naturally sanguine free from the gloom of sarcastic melancholy and ever ready to glow with affectionate enthusiasm His character of Bradshaw may illustrate this remark it is written with peculiar elegance and affection the following portion of it will be sufficient to shew not only the fervency of his friendship but his facility and force of pencil in the delineation of character  Attulerat ad legum scientiam ingenium  liberale animum excelsum

irreproachable integrity of  morals neither gloomy nor severe but courteous and mild  In public councils and labours he is the most indefatigable of men and alone equal to many in his house he if any man may be esteemed hospitable and splendid in proportion to his fortune as a friend faithful in the highest degree and most surely to be depended upon in every emergency no man sooner or more freely acknowledges merit wherever it may be found no man rewards it with greater benevolence he raises from indigence at his own cost sometimes men of piety learning and talents sometimes those brave military men whose prosperity has not been equal to their valour such persons if they are not indigent he still honours with his regard it is his nature to proclaim the desert of others and to be silent on his own  If the cause of any one under oppression is to be openly defended if the influence or authority of men in power is to be opposed if the ingratitude of the public towards any individual of merit is to be reproved no want will be found in this man either of eloquence or courage nor can any sufferer wish to find on such occasions a patron and a friend more suited to his necessities more resolute or more accomplished he already possesses such a friend and such a patron as no menaces can drive from the line of rectitude whom neither terrors nor bribes can divert from the duty he is pursuing or shake from his settled firmness of mind and countenance  A writer of a sanguine imagination who delineates a public character he admires in the glowing colours of affection has rarely the good fortune to find the personage whom he has praised acting in perfect conformity to his panegyric but Milton in one particular circumstance had this rare felicity in regard to the friend whom he so fervently commended for Bradshaw resisted the tyrannical orders of Cromwell in the plenitude of his power with such firmness that we might almost suppose him animated by a desire to act up to the letter of the eulogy with which he had been honoured by the eloquence and the esteem of Milton This will sufficiently appear by the following anecdote in Ludlow's Memoirs who after speaking of Oliver's usurpation and the universal terror he inspired relates how he himself was summoned with Bradshaw Sir Henry Vane and colonel Rich to appear before the usurper in council  Cromwell says Ludlow as soon as he saw the lord president required him to take out a new commission for his office of chief justice of Chester which he refused alledging that he held that place by a grant from the parliament of England to continue 'quamdiu se bene gesserit' and whether he had carried himself with that integrity which his commission exacted he was ready to submit to a trial by twelve Englishmen to be chosen even by Cromwell himself  This opposition to the usurper was assuredly magnanimous and the more so as Bradshaw persisted in it and actually went his circuit as chief justice without paying any regard to what Cromwell had required The odium which  the president justly incurred in the trial of Charles seems to have prevented even our liberal historians from recording with candour the great qualities he possessed he was undoubtedly not only an intrepid but a sincere enthusiast in the cause of the commonwealth His discourse on his deathbed is a sanction to his sincerity he regarded it as meritorious to have pronounced sentence on his king in those awful moments when he was passing himself to the tribunal of his God Whatever we may think of his political tenets let us render justice to the courage and the consistency with which he supported themThe mind of Milton was in unison with the hightoned spirit of this resolute friend and we shall soon see how little ground there is to accuse the poet of servility to Cromwell but we have first to notice the regular series of his political compositions  Soon after his public appointment he was requested by the council to counteract the effect of the celebrated book entitled Icon Basilike the Royal Image and in he published his Iconoclastes the Image Breaker The sagacity of Milton enabled him to discover that the pious work imputed to the deceased king was a political artifice to serve the cause of the royalists but as it was impossible for him to obtain such evidence to detect the imposition as time has since produced he executed a regular reply to the book as a real production of the king intimating at the same time his suspicion of the fraud  This reply has recently drawn on the name of Milton much liberal praise and much injurious obloquy A Scottish  critic of great eminence Lord Monboddo has celebrated the opening of the Iconoclastes as a model of English prose or to use his own just expressions  a specimen of noble and manly eloquence  Johnson from the same work takes occasion to insinuate that Milton was a dishonest man A charge so serious and from a moralist who professed such an attachment to truth deserves some discussion  As faction says the unfriendly biographer seldom leaves a man honest however it might find him Milton is suspected of having interpolated the book called Icon Basilike by inserting a prayer taken from Sidney's Arcadia and imputing it to the king whom he charges in his Iconoclastes with the use of this prayer as with a heavy crime in the indecent language with which prosperity had emboldened the advocates for rebellion to insult all that is venerable and great  A simple question will show the want of candour in this attempt to impeach the moral credit of Milton By whom is he suspected of this dishonesty His severe biographer sinks the name of his own old and dishonourable associate in depreciating Milton and does not inform us that it was the infamous Lauder who having failed to blast the reputation of the poet with equal impotence and fury pursued his attack against the probity of the man in an execrable pamphlet entitled  King Charles the First vindicated from the Charge of Plagiarism brought against him by Milton and Milton himself convicted of Forgery  Instead of naming Lauder who persisted in trying to substantiate this most improbable charge Johnson would insidiously lead us to believe that  the respectable Dr Birch supported it though Birch who had indeed printed in the appendix to his Life of Milton the idle story which Lauder urges as a proof of Milton's imposture had properly rejected that story from the improved edition of his work and honourably united with another candid biographer of the poet the learned bishop of Bristol in declaring that  such contemptible evidence is not to be admitted against a man who had a soul above being guilty of so mean an action  There are some calumnies so utterly despicable and absurd that to refute them elaborately is almost a disgrace did not the calumny I am now speaking of belong to this description it might be here observed that a writer who published remarks on Johnson's Life of Milton in which the asperity of that biographer is opposed with superior asperity has proved with new arguments the futility of the charge in question Instead of repeating these let me observe that the attempt of Johnson to revive a base and sufficiently refuted imputation against the great author whose life he was writing is one of the most extraordinary proofs that literature can exhibit how far the virulence of political hatred may pervert a very powerful mind even a mind which makes moral truth its principal pursuit and assiduously labours to be just This remark is not made in enmity to Johnson but to shew how cautious the most cultivated understanding should be in watching the influence of any hostile prejudice Milton himself may be also urged as an example to enforce the same caution for though he was certainly no impostor in imputing the prayer in question to  the king yet his considering the king's use of it as an offence against heaven is a pitiable absurdity an absurdity as glaring as it would be to affirm that the divine poet is himself profane in assigning to a speech of the Almighty in his poem the two following verses  Son of my bosom son who art alone  My word my wisdom and effectual might  Because they are partly borrowed from a line in Virgil addressed by a heathen goddess to her child  Nate meae vires mea magna potentia solus  The heat of political animosity could thus throw a mist over the bright intellects of Milton yet his Iconoclastes taken all together is a noble effort of manly reason it uncanonized a fictitious saint who assuredly had no pretension to the title  Having thus signalized himself as the literary antagonist of Charles when the celebrated Salmasius was hired to arraign the proceedings of England against him every member of the English council turned his eyes upon Milton as the man from whose spirit and eloquence his country might expect the most able vindication In he published his defence of the people the most elaborate of all his Latin compositions the merits and defects of this signal performance might be most properly discussed in a preliminary discourse to the prose works of Milton here I shall only remark that in the composition of it he gave the most singular  proof of genuine public spirit that ever patriot had occasion to display since at the time of his engaging in this work the infirmity in his eyes was so alarming that his physicians assured him he must inevitably lose them if he persisted in his labour "On this occasion" says Milton to a savage antagonist who had reproached him with blindness  Unde sie mecum reputabam multos graviore malo minus bonum morte gloriam redemisse mihi contra majus bonum minore cum malo proponi ut possem cum caecitate sola

a lighter good glory with death to me on the contrary greater good was proposed with an inferior evil so that by incurring blindness alone I might fulfil the most honourable of all duties which as it is a more solid advantage than glory itself ought to be more eligible in the estimation of every man I resolved therefore to make what short use I might yet have of my eyes as conducive as possible to public utility you see what I preferred and what I lost with the principle on which I acted let slanderers therefore cease to talk irreverently on the judgment of God and to make me the subject of their fictions let them know that I am far from considering my lot with  sorrow or repentance that I persist immovable in my sentiment that I neither fancy nor feel the anger of God but on the contrary experience and acknowledge his paternal clemency and kindness in my most important concerns in this especially that by the comfort and confirmation which he himself infuses into my spirit I acquiesce in his divine pleasure continually considering rather what he has bestowed upon me than what he has denied Finally that I would not exchange the consciousness of my own conduct for their merit whatever it may be or part with a remembrance which is to my own mind a perpetual source of tranquillity and satisfaction  Whenever he is induced to mention himself the purity and vigour of Milton's mind appear in full lustre whether he speaks in verse or in prose the preceding passage from his Second Defence is consonant to the sonnet on his blindness addressed to Syriac Skinner which though different critics have denied the author to excel in this minute species of composition has hardly been surpassed it deserves double praise for energy of expression and heroism of sentiment  Cyriac this threeyears day these eyes tho' clear  To outward view of blemish or of spot  Bereft of sight their seeing have forgot  Nor to their idle orbs does day appear  Or sun or moon or star

conscience friend to have lost them overply'd  In liberty's defence my noble task  Of which all Europe talks from side to side  This thought might lead me thro' the world's vain mask  Content tho' blind had I no better guide  The ambition of Milton was as pure as his genius was sublime his first object on every occasion was to merit the approbation of his conscience and his God when this most important point was secured he seems to have indulged the predominant passion of great minds and to have exulted with a triumph proportioned to his toil in the celebrity he acquired he must have been insensible indeed to public applause had he not felt elated by the signal honours which were paid to his name in various countries as the eloquent defender of the English nation "  Hoc etiam vere possium dicere quo primùm tempore nostra defensio est edita et legentium studia incaluere nullum vel principis yel civitatis legatum in urbe tum fuisse qui non vel fortè obvio mihi gratuleretur vel conventum apud se cuperet vel domi inviseretProse Works vol p  This I can truly affirm" says Milton in mentioning the reception of his great political performance  that as soon as my defence of the people was published and read with avidity there was not in our metropolis any ambassador from any state or sovereign who did not either congratulate me if we met by chance or express a desire to receive me at his house or visit me at mine  Toland relates that he received from the parliament a present of a thousand pounds for the defence The author does not include this circumstance among the many particulars he mentions of himself and if such a reward was ever bestowed upon him it must have been after the publication of his Second Defence in which he affirms that he was content with having discharged what he considered as an honourable public duty without aiming at a pecuniary recompence and that instead of having acquired the opulence with which his adversary reproached him he received not the slightest gratuity for that production  Contentus quae honesta factu sunt ea propter se solum appetisse et gratis persequi id alii viderint tuque seito me illas "opimitates" atque "op

for in speaking of his blindness he says that  far from being neglected on this account by the highest characters in the republic they constantly regarded him with indulgence and favour not seeking to deprive him either of distinction or emolument though his powers of being useful were diminished  hence he compares himself to an ancient Athenian supported by a decree of honour at the expence of the

received the applause of  Christina afforded him the highest gratification for he regarded it as an honourable proof of what he had ever affirmed that he was a friend to good sovereigns though an enemy to tyrants he understood that the queen of Sweden had made this distinction in commending his book and in the warmth of his gratitude he bestowed on the northern princess a very splendid panegyric of which the subsequent conduct of that singular and fantastic personage too clearly proved her unworthy yet Milton cannot fairly be charged with servile adulation Christina when he appeared as her eulogist was the idol of the literary world The candour with which she spake as a queen on his defence of the people would naturally strike the author as an engaging proof of her discernment and magnanimity he was also gratified in no common degree by the coolness with which she treated his adversary for Salmasius whom she had invited to her court for his erudition was known to have lost her favour when his literary arrogance and imbecility were exposed and chastised by the indignant spirit or Milton The wretched Salmasius indeed was utterly overwhelmed in the encounter he had quitted France his native country where he honourably disdained to purchase a pension by flattering the tyranny of Richlieu and had settled in Leyden as an asylum of liberty he seemed therefore as one of his Parisian correspondents observed to him  to cancel the merit of his former conduct by writing against England  Salmasius was extravagantly vain and trusted too much to his great reputation as a scholar his antagonist on the contrary was so little known as a Latin writer before the  defence appeared that several friends advised Milton not to hazard his credit against a name so eminent as that of Salmasuis Never did a literary conflict engage the attention of a wider circle and never did victory declare more decidedly in favour of the party from whom the public had least expectation Perhaps no author ever acquired a more rapid and extensive celebrity than Milton gained by this contest Let us however remark for the interest of literature that the two combatants were both to blame in their reciprocal use of weapons utterly unworthy of the great cause that each had to sustain not content to wield the broad and bright sword of national argument they both descended to use the mean and envenomed dagger of personal malevolence They have indeed great authorities of modern time to plead in their excuse not to mention the bitter disputants or antiquity It was the opinion of Johnson and Milton himself seems to have entertained the same idea that it is allowable in literary contention to ridicule vilify and depreciate as much as possible the character of an opponent Surely this doctrine is unworthy of the great names who have endeavoured to support it both in theory and practice a doctrine not only morally wrong but prudentially defective for a malevolent spirit in eloquence is like a dangerous varnish in painting which may produce indeed a brilliant and forcible effect for a time but ultimately injures the success of the production a remark that may be verified in perusing the Latin prose of Milton where elegance of language and energy of sentiment  suffer not a little from being blended with the tiresome asperity of personal invective  It is a pleasing transition to return from his enemies to his friends He had a mind and heart peculiarly alive to the duties and delights of friendship and seems to have been peculiarly happy in this important article of human life In speaking of his blindness he mentions in the most interesting manner the assiduous and tender attention which he received on that occasion from his friends in general some of them he regarded as not inferior in kindness to Theseus and Pylades the ancient demigods of amity We have lost perhaps some little poems that flowed from the heart of Milton by their being addressed to persons who in the vicissitudes of public fortune were suddenly plunged into obscurity with the honours they had received Some of his sonnets that we possess did not venture into public till many years after the death of their author for political reasons others might be concealed from the same motive and in such concealment they might easily perish I can hardly believe that he never addressed a verse to Bradshaw whom we have seen him praising so eloquently in prose and among those whom he mentions with esteem in his Latin works there is a less known military friend who seems still more likely to have been honoured with some tribute of the poet's affection that time and chance may have destroyed I mean his friend Overton a soldier of eminence in the service of the parliament whom Milton describes  as endeared to him through many years by the similitude of their pursuits by the sweetness of his manners  and by an intimacy surpassing even the union of brothers  Te Overtone mihi multis ab hinc annis et studiorum similitudine et morum suavitate concord  plusquam fraternâ conjunctissime  Prose Work Vol II p    A character so highly and tenderly esteemed by the poet has a claim to the attention of his biographer Overton is commended by the frank ingenuous Ludlow as a brave and faithful officer he is also ridiculed in a ballad of the royalists as a religious enthusiast He had a gratuity of l a year conferred on him for his bravery by the parliament and had risen to the rank of a major general Cromwell apprehensive that Overton was conspiring against his usurpation first imprisoned him in the tower and afterwards confined him in the island of Jersey A letter in which Marvel relates to Milton his having presented to the Protector at Windsor a recent copy of the Second Defence expresses at the same time an affectionate curiosity concerning the business of Overton who was at that time just brought to London by a mysterious order of Cromwell He did not escape from confinement till after the death of Oliver when in consequence of a petition from his sister to the parliament he obtained his release Soon after the restoration he was again imprisoned in the Tower with Colonel Desborow on a rumour of their being concerned in a treasonable commotion but as that rumour seems to have been a political device of the royalists contrived to strengthen the new government he probably regained his freedom though we know not how his active days were concluded The anxiety and anguish that Milton must have indured in the various calamities to which his friends  were exposed on the vicissitude of public affairs formed I apprehend the severest sufferings of his extraordinary life in which genius and affliction seem to have contended for preeminence  Some traces of the sufferings I allude to though mysteriously veiled are yet visible in his poetry and will be noticed hereafter Not to anticipate the severest evil of his destiny let me now speak of a foreign friend in whose lively regard he found only honour and delight On the publication of his defence Leonard Philaras a native of Athens who had distinguished himself in Italy and risen to the rank of envoy from the duke of Parma to the court of France conceived a flattering desire to cultivate the friendship of Milton With this view he sent him his portrait with very engaging letters and the highest commendation of the recent defence The reply of Milton is remarkable for its elegance and spirit after thanking his correspondent for presents so agreeable he says  Cum enim Alexander ille

fortunate indeed and esteem it as the highest honour to be thus commended by the man in whom alone the genius and virtue of the ancient Athenians seem after so long an interval to revive and flourish As your city has produced many most eloquent men I am perfectly willing to confess that whatever proficiency I have made in literature is chiefly owing to my long and incessant study of their works Had I acquired from them such powers of language as might enable me to stimulate our fleets and armies to deliver Greece the native seat of eloquence from the tyranny of the Turks a splendid enterprize for which you almost seem to implore our assistance I would assuredly do what would then be among the first objects of my desire for what did the bravest or most eloquent men of antiquity consider as more glorious or more worthy of themselves than by persuasive language or bold exploits to render the Greeks free and their own legislators  He closes his letter by observing very justly that  it is first necessary to kindle in the minds of the modern Greeks the spirit and virtue of their ancestors  politely adding that  if this could be accomplished by any man it might be most reasonably  expected from the patriotic enthusiasm and the experience civil and military of his accomplished correspondent  This letter is dated June Milton had soon afterwards the gratification of a visit from this liberal Athenian who took so tender an interest in the blindness of his friend that on his return to Paris he wrote to him on the subject The following answer of Milton relates the particulars of his disorder and shews at the same time with what cheerful magnanimity he supported it  Leonardo Philarae Atheniena  Cum sim a pueritia totius Graeci nominis tuam umque in primis

have cherished from my childhood if ever mortal did a reverential fondness for the Grecian name and  for your native Athens in particular so have I continually persuaded myself that at some period I should receive from that city a very signal return for my benevolent regard nor has the ancient genius of your most noble country sailed to realize my presage he has given me in you an Attic brother and one most tenderly attached to me Though I was known to you only by my writings and though your residence was far distant from mine you first addressed me in the most engaging terms by letter and afterwards coming unexpectedly to London and visiting the stranger who had no eyes to see you continued your kindness to me under that calamity which can render me a more eligible friend  to no one and to many perhaps may make me an object of disregard  Since therefore you request me not to reject all hope of recovering my sight as you have an intimate friend at Paris in Thevenot the physician who excels particularly in relieving ocular complaints and whom you wish to consult concerning my eyes after receiving from me such an account as may enable him to understand the source and symptoms of my disorder I will certainly follow your kind suggestion that I may not appear to reject assistance thus offered me perhaps providentially  It is about ten years I think since I perceived my sight to grow weak and dim finding at the same time my intestines afflicted with flatulence and oppression  Even in the morning if I began as usual to read my eyes immediately suffered pain and seemed to shrink from reading but after some moderate bodily exercise were refreshed whenever I looked at a candle I saw a sort of iris around it Not long afterwards on the left side of my left eye which began to fail some years before the other a darkness arose that hid from me all things on that sideif I chanced to close my right eye whatever was before me seemed diminishedIn the last three years as my remaining eye failed by degrees some months before my sight was utterly gone all things that I could discern though I moved not myself appeared to sluctate now to the right now to the left Obstinate vapours seem to have settled all over my forehead and my temples overwhelming my eyes with a sort of sleepy heaviness especially after food till the  evening so that I frequently recollect the condition of the prophet Phineus in the Argonautics  Him vapours dark  Envelop'd and the earth appeared to roll  Beneath him sinking in a lifeless trance  But I should not omit to say that while I had some little sight remaining as soon as I went to bed and reclined on either side a copious light used to dart from my closed eyes then as my sight grew daily less darker colours seemed to burst forth with vehemence and a kind of internal noise but now as if every thing lucid were extinguished blackness either absolute or chequered and interwoven as it were with ashcolour is accustomed to pour itself on my eyes yet the darkness perpetually before them as well during the night as in the day seems always approaching rather to white than to black admitting as the eye rolls a minute portion of light as through a crevice  Though from your physician such a portion of hope also may arise yet as under an evil that admits no cure I regulate and tranquilize my mind often reflecting that since the days of darkness allotted to each as the wise man reminds us are many hitherto my darkness by the singular mercy of God with the aid of study leisure and the kind conversation of my friends is much less oppressive than the deadly darkness to which he alludes For if as it is written man lives not by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God why should not a  man acquiesce even in this not thinking that he can derive light from his eyes alone but esteeming himself sufficiently enlightened by the conduct or providence of God  As long therefore as he looks forward and provides for me as he does and leads me backward and forward by the hand as it were through my whole life shall I not cheerfully bid my eyes keep holiday since such appears to be his pleasure But whatever may be the event of your kindness my dear Philaras with a mind not less resolute and firm than if I were Lynceus himself I bid you farewell  Westminster  Sept  We have no reason to imagine that Milton received any kind of medical benefit from the friendly intention of this amiable foreigner Strange as the idea may at first appear perhaps it was better for him as a man and as a poet to remain without a cure for his devout tenderness and energy of mind had so far converted his calamity into a blessing that it seems rather to have promoted than obstructed both the happiness of his life and the perfection of his genius We have seen in the admirable sonnet on his blindness how his reflections on the conscientious labour by which he lost his eyes gave a dignified satisfaction to his spirit In one of his prose works he expresses a sentiment on the same subject that shews in the most striking point of view the meekness and sublimity of his devotion He exults in his misfortune and feels it endeared to him by the persuasion that to be blind is to be placed more immediately  under the conduct and providence of God  Sed neque ego caecis afflictis moerentibus imbecillis tam  l

quicken and invigorate his mental powers Blindness indeed without the aid of religious enthusiasm has a natural tendency to favour that undisturbed intense and continual meditation which works of magnitude require Perhaps we sometimes include in the catalogue of disadvantages the very circumstances that have been partly instrumental in leading extraordinary men to distinction In examining the lives of illustrious scholars we may discover that many of them arose to glory by the impulse of personal misfortune Bacon and Pope were deformed Homer and Milton were blind  It has been frequently remarked that the blind are generally cheerful it is not therefore marvellous that Milton was very far from being dispirited by the utter extinction of his sight but his unconquerable vigour of mind was signally displayed in continuing to labour under all the pains and inconveniencies of approaching blindness a state peculiarly unfavourable to mental exertion  From the very eloquent preface to his Defence we learn that while he was engaged on that composition and eager to throw into it all the force of his exalted mind  his infirmity obliged him to work only by starts and scarce to touch in short periods of study broken by hourly interruptions what he wished to pursue with continued application  Quod si quis mitetur fortè cur ergò tam diu intactum et ovantem nostroque omnium silentio

persequi debuissem  Pro Works vol p    In this most uneasy and perilous labour he exerted his failing eyes to the utmost and to repeat his own triumphant expression  Lost them overply'd  In liberty's defence  His left eye became utterly blind in the year in which the book that he alludes to was published and he lost the use of the other in the year in which he wrote concerning his blindness to his Athenian friend In this interval he repeatedly changed his abode As every spot inhabited by such a man acquires a sort of consecration in the fancy of his admirers I shall here transcribe from his nephew the particulars of his residence  First he lodged at one Thomson's next door to the Bull Head tavern at Charing Cross opening into th  Spring Garden which seems to have been only a lodging taken till his designed apartment in Scotland Yard was prepared for him for hither he soon removed from the aforesaid place and here his third child a son was born which through the illusage or bad constitution of an illchosen nurse died an infant From this apartment whether he thought it not healthy or otherwise convenient for his use or whatever else was the reason he soon after took a pretty gardenhouse in Petty France in Westminster next door to the Lord Scudamore's and opening into St James's Park where he remained no less than eight years namely from the year till within a few weeks of King Charles the Second's restoration  Philips also informs us that while his uncle lodged at Thomson's he was employed in revising and polishing the Latin work of his youngest nephew John who on the publication of a severe attack upon Milton ascribed to Bramhall Bishop of Derry vindicated his illustrious relation and satirized his supposed adversary with a keenness and vehemence of invective which induced perhaps some readers to suspect that the performance was written entirely by Milton The traces however of a young hand are evident in the work and John Philips at the time it appeared was a youth of nineteen or twenty eager as he declares to engage unsolicited in a composition which however abounding in juvenile defects proves him attached to his country and grateful to his friends  In Milton now utterly blind appeared again in the field of controversy first in his Second Defence of the English People and the following year in a defence of himself "Autoris pro se Defensio" The first of these productions is in truth his own vindication it is the work in which he speaks most abundantly of his own character and conduct it displays that true eloquence of the heart by which probity and talents are enabled to defeat the malevolence of an insolent accuser it proves that the mind of this wonderful man united to the poetic imagination of Homer the argumentative energy of Demosthenes  It must however be allowed that while Milton defended himself with the spirit of the Grecian orator in imitating the eloquent Athenian he promiscuously caught both his merits and defects It is to be regretted that these mighty masters of rhetoric permitted so large an alloy of personal virulence to debase the dignity of national argument yet as the great orators of an age more humanized are apt we see to be hurried into the same failing we may conclude that it is almost inseparable from the weakness of nature and we must not expect to find though we certainly should endeavour to introduce the charity of the Gospel in political contention  If the utmost acrimony of invective could in any case be justified it might assuredly be so by the calumnies which hurried both Demosthenes and Milton into those intemperate expressions which appear in their respective vindications like specks of a meaner mineral in a mass of the richest ore The outrages that called forth the vindictive  thunders of the eloquent Athenian are sufficiently known The indignation of Milton was awakened by a Latin work published at the Hague in entitled "Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Caelum" The Cry of Royal Blood to Heaven In this book all the bitter terms of abhorrence and reproach with which the malignity of passion can dishonour learning were lavished on the eloquent defender of the English commonwealth The secret author of this scurrility was Peter du Moulin a Protestant divine and son of a French author whom the biographers of his own country describe as a satirist without taste and a theologian without temper Though du Moulin seems to have inherited the acrimonious spirit of his father he had not the courage to publish himself what he had written as the antagonist of Milton but sent his papers to Salmasius who entrusted them to Alexander More a French protestant of Scotch extraction and a divine who agreed in his principles with the author of the manuscript  Most unfortunately for his own future comfort More published without a name the work of Du Moulin with a dedication to Charles the Second under the signature of Ulac the Dutch printer He decorated the book with a portrait of Charles and applied at the same time to Milton the Virgilian delineation of Polypheme  Monstrum horrendum insorme ingens cui lumen ademptum  A monstrous bulk deform'd depriv'd of sight  DRYDEN  Never was a savage insult more completely avenged for Milton having discovered that More was unquestionably the publisher of the work considered him as its author which according to legal maxims he had a right to do and in return exposed with such severity of reproof the irregular and licentious life of his adversary that losing his popularity as a preacher he seems to have been overwhelmed with public contempt  There is a circumstance hitherto unnoticed in this controversy that may be considered as a proof of Milton's independent and inflexible spirit More having heard accidentally from an acquaintance of the English author that he was preparing to expose him as the editor of the scurrilous work he had published contrived to make great interest in England first to prevent the appearance and again to soften the personal severity of Milton's Second Defence The Dutch ambassador endeavoured to prevail on Cromwell to suppress the work When he found that this was impossible he conveyed to Milton the letters of More containing a protestation that he was not the author of the invective which had given so much offence the ambassador at the same time made it his particular request to Milton that in answering the book as far as it related to the English government he would abstain from all hostility against MoreMilton replied  that no unbecoming words should proceed from his pen  but his principles would not allow him to spare at any private intercession a public enemy of his country These particulars are collected from the last of our author's political treatises in Latin the defence  of himself and they form I trust a favourable introduction to a refutation which it is time to begin of the severest and most plausible charge that the recent enemies of Milton have urged against him I mean the charge of servility and adulation as the sycophant of an usurper  I will state the charge in the words of his most bitter accuser and without abridgment that it may appear in its full force  Cromwell says Johnson had now dismissed the parliament by the authority of which he had destroyed monarchy and commenced monarch himself under the title of protector but with kingly and more than kingly powerThat his authority was lawful never was pretended he himself founded his right only in necessity but Milton having now tasted the honey of public employment would not return to hunger and philosophy but continuing to exercise his office under a manifest usurpation betrayed to his power that liberty which he had defended Nothing can be more just than that rebellion should end in slavery that he who had justified the murder of the king for some acts which to him seemed unlawful should now sell his services and his flatteries to a tyrant of whom it was evident that he could do nothing lawful  Let us observe for the honour of Milton that the paragraph in which he is arraigned with so much rancour contains a political dogma that if it were really true might blast the glory of all the illustrious characters who are particularly endeared to every English heart If nothing can be  more just than that rebellion should end in slavery why do we revere those ancestors who contended against kings why do we not resign the privileges that we owe to their repeated rebellion but the dogma is utterly unworthy of an English moralist for assuredly we have the sanction of truth reason and experience in saying that rebellion is morally criminal or meritorious according to the provocation by which it is excited and the end it pursues This doctrine was supported even by a servant of the imperious Elizabeth "Sir Thomas Smith" says Milton in his Tenure of Kings and Magistrates  a protestant and a statesman in his Commonwealth of England putting the question whether it be lawful to rise against a tyrant answers that the vulgar judge of it according to the event and the learned according to the purpose of them that do it  Dr Johnson though one of  the learned  here shews not that candour which the liberal statesman had described as the characteristic of  their  judgment The biographer uttering himself political tenets of the most servile complexion accuses Milton of servility and in his mode of using the words honey and hunger falls into a petulant meanness of expression that too clearly discovers how cordially he detested him But perhaps this detestation was the mere effect of political prejudice the common but unchristian abhorrence that a vehement royalist thinks it virtue to harbour and to manifest against a republican We might indeed easily believe that Johnson's rancour against Milton was merely political had he not appeared as the biographer of another illustrious republican but when we find him representing as honourable  in Blake the very principles and conduct which he endeavours to make infamous and contemptible in Milton can we fail to observe that he renders not the same justice to the heart of the great republican author which he had nobly rendered to the gallant admiral of the republic To Blake he generously assigns the praise of intrepidity honesty contempt of wealth and love of his country Assuredly these virtues were as eminent in Miltonand however different their lines in life may appear the celebrated speech of Blake to his seamen "It is our business to hinder foreigners from fooling us" by which he justified his continuance in his post under Cromwell is singularly applicable to Milton who as a servant engaged by the state to conduct in Latin its foreign correspondence might think himself as strongly bound in duty and honour as the justly applauded admiral  to hinder his country from being fooled by foreigners  "But Milton" says his uncandid biographer  continuing to exercise his office under a manifest usurpation betrayed to his power that liberty which he had defended  Was the usurpation more manifest to Milton than to Blake Or is it a deeper crime against liberty to write the Latin dispatches than to fight the naval battles of a nation under the controul of an usurper Assuredly not nor had either Blake or Milton the least intention of betraying that liberty which was equally the darling idol of their elevated and congenial spirits but in finding the learned and eloquent biographer of these two immortal worthies so friendly to the admiral and so inimical  to the author have we not reason to lament and reprove such inconsistent hostility  That the Latin secretary of the nation deserved not this bitterness of censure for remaining in his office may be thought sufficiently proved by the example of BlakeIf his conduct in this article required farther justification we might recollect with the candid bishop Newton that the blameless Sir Matthew Hale the favourite model of integrity exercised under Cromwell the higher office of a judge but the heaviest charge against Milton is yet unanswered the charge of lavishing the most servile adulation on the usurper  In replying to this most plausible accusation let me be indulged in a few remarks that may vindicate the credit not only of a single poet but of all Parnassus The poetical fraternity have been often accused of being ever ready to flatter but the general charge is in some measure inconsistent with a knowledge of human nature As poets generally speaking have more sensibility and less prudence than other men we should naturally expect to find them rather distinguished by abundance than by a want of sincerity when they are candidly judged they will generally be found so a poet indeed is as apt to applaud a hero as a lover is to praise his mistress and both according to the forcible and true expression of Shakespear  Are of imagination all compact  Their descriptions are more faithful to the acuteness of their own feelings than to the real qualities of the objects described Paradoxical as it may sound they are often deficient in truth in proportion to the excess of their sincerity the charm or the merit they celebrate is partly the phantom of their own fancy but they believe it real while they praise it as a reality and as long as their belief is sincere it is unjust to accuse them of adulation Milton himself gives us an excellent touchstone for the trial of praise in the following passage of his Areopagitica  there are three principal things without which all praising is but courtship and flattery first when that only is praised which is solidly worth praise next when greatest likelihoods are brought that such things are truly and really in those persons to whom they are ascribed the other when he who praises by shewing that such his actual persuasion is of whom he writes can demonstrate that he flatters not  If we try Milton by this his own equitable law we must honourably acquit him of the illiberal charge that might almost be thought sufficiently refuted by its apparent inconsistency with his elevated spirit  Though in the temperate judgment of posterity Cromwell appears only a bold bad man yet he dazzled and deceived his contemporaries with such a strong and continued blaze of real and visionary splendor that almost all the power and all the talents on earth seemed eager to pay him unsolicited homage but I mean not to rest the vindication of Milton on the prevalence of example which however high and dignified it might be could never serve as a sanction  for the man to whom the rare union of spotless integrity with consummate genius had given an elevation of character that no rank and no powers unsupported by probity could possibly bestow though all the potentates and all the literati of the world conspired to flatter the usurper we might expect Milton to remain like his own faithful Abdiel  Unshaken unseduc'd unterrified  Assuredly he was so and in praising Cromwell he praised a personage whose matchless hypocrisy assumed before him a mask that the arch apostate of the poet could not wear in the presence of Abdiel the mask of affectionate zeal towards man and of devout attachment to God a mask that Davenant has described with poetical felicity in the following couplet  Dissembled zeal ambition's old disguise  The vizard in which fools outface the wise  It was more as a faint than as an hero that Cromwell deluded the generous credulity of Milton and perhaps the recollection of his having been thus deluded inspired the poet with his admirable apology for Uriel deceived by Satan  For neither man nor angel can discern  Hypocrisy the only evil that walks  Invisible except to God alone  By his permissive will thro' heav'n and earth  And oft tho' wisdom wake suspicion sleeps  At wisdom's gate and to simplicity  Resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill  Where no ill seems  That sublime religious enthusiasm which was the predominant characteristic of the poet exposed him particularly to be duped by the prime artifice of the political impostor who was indeed so consummate in the art of deception that he occasionally deceived the prudent unheated Ludlow and the penetrating inflexible Bradshaw nay who carried his habitual deception to such a length that he is supposed by some acute judges of human nature to have been ultimately the dupe of his own hypocritical fervour and to have thought himself what he induced many to think him the selected servant of God expressly chosen to accomplish wonders not only for the good of his nation but for the true interest of Christendom  Though Cromwell had assumed the title of Protector when Milton in his second defence sketched a masterly portrait of him as we have seen he did of Bradshaw in the same production yet the new potentate had not at this period completely unveiled his domineering and oppressive character on the contrary he affected with the greatest art such a tender concern for the people he represented himself both in his public and private protestations so perfectly free from all ambitious desires that many persons who possessed not the noble unsuspecting simplicity of Milton believed the Protector sincere in declaring that he reluctantly submitted to the cares of government merely for the settlement and  security of the nation With a mind full of fervid admiration for his marvellous atchievements and generally disposed to give him credit for every upright intention Milton hailed him as the father of his country and delineated his character if there were some particles of flattery in this panegyric which if we adhere to our author's just definition of flattery we cannot allow it was completely purified from every cloud or speck of servility by the most splendid and sublime admonition that was ever given to a man possessed of great talents and great power by a genuine and dauntless friend to whom talents and power were only objects of reverence when under the real or fancied direction of piety and virtue  "  Reverere tantam de te expectationem spem patriae de te unicam

great expectation the only hope which our country now rests upon  yourevere the sight and the sufferings of so many brave men who under your guidance have fought so strenuously for freedomrevere the credit we have gained in foreign nationsreflect on the great things they promise themselves from our liberty so bravely acquired from our republic so gloriously founded which should it perish like an abortion must expose our country to the utmost contempt and dishonour  "Finally revere yourself and having sought and sustained every hardship and danger for the acquisition of this liberty let it not be violated by yourself or impaired by others in the smallest degree In truth it is impossible for you to be free yourself unless we are so for it is the ordinance of nature that the man who first invades the liberty of others must first lose his own and first feel himself a slave This indeed is just But if the very patron and tutelary angel of liberty if he who is generally regarded as preeminent in justice in sanctity and virtue if he should ultimately invade that liberty which he asserted himself such invasion must indeed be pernicious and fatal not only to himself but to the general interest of piety and virtue Truth probity and religion would then lose the estimation  and confidence of mankind the worst of wounds since the fall of our first parents that could be

intercourse with God These and more I doubt not but you diligently revolve in your mind and this in particular by what methods you may be most able to accomplish things of highest moment and secure to us our liberty not only safe but enlarged"  If a private individual thus speaking to a man of unbounded influence whom a powerful nation had idolized and courted to assume the reins of government can be called a flatterer we have only to wish that all the flatterers of earthly power may be of the same complexion The admonition  to the people with which Milton concludes his second defence is by no means inferior in dignity and spirit to the advice he bestowed on the protector The great misfortune of the monitor was that the two parties to whom he addressed his eloquent and patriotic exhortation were neither of them so worthy of his counsel as he wished them to be and endeavoured to make them For Cromwell as his subsequent conduct sufficiently proved was a political impostor with an arbitrary soul and as to the people they were alternately the dishonoured instruments and victims of licentiousness and fanaticism The protector his adherents and his enemies to speak of them in general were as little able to reach the disinterested purity of Milton's principles as they were to attain and even to estimate the sublimity of his poetical genius But Milton who passionately loved his country though he saw and lamented the various corruptions of his contemporaries still continued to hope with the native ardour of a sanguine spirit that the mass of the English people would be enlightened and improved His real sentiments of Cromwell I am persuaded were these he long regarded him as a person not only possessed of wonderful influence and ability but disposed to attempt and likely to accomplish the purest and noblest purposes of policy and religion yet often thwarted and embarrassed in his best designs not only by the power and machinations of the enemies with whom he had to contend but by the want of faith morality and sense in the motley multitude whom he endeavoured to guide and govern As religious enthusiasm was the predominant  characteristic of Milton it is most probable that his fervid imagination beheld in Cromwell a person destined by heaven to reduce if not to annihilate what he considered as the most enormous grievance of earth the prevalence of popery and superstition The several humane and spirited letters which he wrote in the name of Cromwell to redress the injuries of the persecuted protestants who suffered in Piedmont were highly calculated to promote in equal degrees his zeal for the purity of religion and his attachment to the protector  Yet great as the powers of Cromwell were to dazzle and delude and willing as the liberal mind of Milton was to give credit to others for that pure public spirit which he possessed himself there is great reason to apprehend that his veneration and esteem for the protector were entirely destroyed by the treacherous despotism of his latter days But however his opinion of Oliver might change he was far from betraying liberty according to Johnson's ungenerous accusation by continuing to exercise his office on the contrary it ought to be esteemed a proof of his fidelity to freedom that he condescended to remain in an office which he had received from no individual and in which he justly considered himself as a servant of the state From one of his familiar letters written in the year preceding the death of Cromwell it is evident that he had no secret intimacy or influence with the protector and that instead of engaging in ambitious machinations he confined himself as much as possible to the privacy of domestic life Finally on a full and fair review of all the intercourse between Milton and  Cromwell there is not the smallest ground to suspect that Milton ever spoke or acted as a sycophant or a slave he bestowed indeed the most liberal eulogy both in prose and rhyme upon the protector but at a period when it was the general opinion that the utmost efforts of panegyric could hardly equal the magnitude and the variety of the services rendered to his country by the acknowledged hero and the fancied patriot at a period when the eulogist who understood the frailty of human nature and foresaw the temptations of recent power might hope that praise so magnificent united to the noblest advice would prove to the ardent spirit of the protector the best preservative against the delirium of tyranny These generous hopes were disappointed the despotic proceedings of Cromwell convinced his independent monitor that he deserved not the continued applause of a free spirit and though the atchievements of the protector were so fascinating that poetical panegyrics encircled even his grave yet Milton praised him no more but after his decease fondly hailed the revival of parliamentary independence as a new dawning of God's providence on the nation In contemplating these two extraordinary men together the real lover of truth and freedom can hardly fail to observe the striking contrast of their characters one was an absolute model of false and the other of true grandeur Mental dignity and public virtue were in Cromwell fictitious and delusive in Milton they were genuine and unchangeable Cromwell shews the formidable wonders that courage and cunning can perform with the assistance of fortune Milton the wonders of a superior  kind that integrity and genius can accomplish in despight of adversity and affliction  An eager solicitude to vindicate a most noble mind from a very base and injurious imputation has led me to anticipate some public events From these observations on the native and incorruptible independence of Milton's mind let us return to the incidents of his domestic life  Soon after his removal to his house in Westminster his fourth child Deborah was born on the d of May The mother according to Philips died in childbed The situation of Milton at this period was such as might have depressed the mind of any ordinary man at the age of fortyfour he was left a widower with three female orphans the eldest about six years old deformed in her person and with an impediment in her speech his own health was very delicate and with eyes that were rapidly sinking into incurable blindness he was deeply engaged in a literary contest of the highest importance With what spirit and success he triumphed over his political and personal enemies the reader is already informed When these in were all silenced and subdued by the irresistible power of his superior talents and probity  he had leisure again says his nephew for his own studies and private designs  It seems to have been the habit of Milton to devote as many hours in every day to intense study as the mental faculties could bear and to render such constant exertion less oppressive to the mind by giving variety to the objects of its application engaging in different works of magnitude at the same time that he might occasionally relieve and inspirit  his thoughts by a transition from one species of composition to another If we may rely on the information of Philips he now began to employ himself in this manner on three great works a voluminous Latin Dictionary a history of England and an Epic poem of the two last I shall speak again according to the order of their publication The first and least important a work to which blindness was peculiarly unfavourable was never brought to maturity yet served to amuse this most diligent of authors by a change of literary occupation almost to the close of his life His collection of words amounted to three folios but the papers after his decease were so discomposed and deficient to use the expression of his nephew that the work could not be made fit for the press They proved serviceable however to future compilers and were used by those who published the Latin Dictionary at Cambridge in  Though he had no eyes to chuse a second wife Milton did not long continue a widower He married Catherine the daughter of Captain Woodcock a rigid sectarist says Mr Warton of Hackney This lady appears to have been the most tender and amiable of the poet's three wives and she is the only one of the three whom the muse of Milton has immortalized with an affectionate memorial Within the year of their marriage she gave birth to a daughter and very soon followed her infant to the grave "Her husband" says Johnson  has honoured her memory with a poor sonnet  an expression of contempt which only proves that the rough critic was unable to sympathise with the  tenderness that reigns in the pathetic poetry of Milton in the opening of this sonnet  Methought I saw my late espoused saint  Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave  Whom Jove's great son to her glad husband gave  Rescued from death by force tho' pale and faint  and in the latter part of it  Her face was veil'd yet to my fancied sight  Love sweetness goodness in her person shin'd  So clear as in no face with more delight  But O as to embrace me she inclin'd  I wak'd she fled and day brought back my night  Milton has equalled the mournful graces of Petrarch and of Camoens who have each of them left a plaintive composition on a similar idea The curious reader who may wish to compare the three poets on this occasion will find the similarity I speak of in the th sonnet of Petrarch and the d of Camoens  The loss of a wife so beloved and the severe inthralment of his country under the increasing despotism of Cromwell must have wounded very deeply the tender and patriotic feelings of Milton His variety of affliction from these sources might probably occasion his being silent as an author for some years In he is supposed to have written a national manifesto in Latin to justify the war against Spain From that time when his defence of himself  also appeared we know not of his having been engaged in any publication till the year excepting a political manuscript of Sir Walter Raleigh called the Cabinet Council which he printed in with a brief advertisement What his sentiments were concerning the last years of Cromwell and the following distracted period we have a striking proof in one of his private letters written not long after the death of the protector In reply to his foreign friend Oldenburg he says  Ab historia nostrorum motuum concinnanda quod hortari videris longe absum sunt enim silentio digniores quam praeconio nec nobis qui motuum historiam concinnare sed qui motus ipsos componere feliciter possit est opus tecum enim ver  or ne libertatis ac religionis hostibus nunc nuper societatis nimis opportuni inter has nostras civiles discordias vel potius insanias videamur verum non illi gravius quam nosmetipsi jamdiu flagitiis nostris religioni vulnus intulerintProse Works vol p  "I am very far from preparing a history of our commotions as you seem to advise for they are more worthy of silence than of panegyric nor do we want a person with ability to frame an history of our troubles but to give those troubles a happy termination for I sympathise with you in the fear that the enemies of our liberty and our religion who are recently combined may find us too much exposed to their attack in these our civil dissentions or rather our fits of frenzy they cannot however wound our religion more than we have done ourselves by our own enormities" The interest of religion appears on every occasion to have maintained its due ascendency in the mind of Milton and to have formed through the whole course of his life the primary object of his pursuit it led him to publish in two distinct treatises the first on civil power in ecclesiastical causes the second  on the likeliest means to remove hirelings out of the church performances which Johnson presumes to characterize by an expression not very consonant to the spirit of Christianity representing them as written merely to gratify the author's malevolence to the clergy a coarse reproach which every bigot bestows upon enlightened solicitude for the purity of religion and particularly uncandid in the present case because the devout author has conscientiously explained his own motives in the following expressions addressed to the long parliament restored after the decease of Cromwell  "Of civil liberty I have written heretofore by the appointment and not without the approbation of civil power of Christian liberty I write now which others long since having done with all freedom under heathen emperors I should do wrong to suspect that I now shall with less under Christian governors and such especially as profess openly their defence of Christian liberty although I write this not otherways appointed or induced than by an inward persuasion of the Christian duty which I may usefully discharge herein to the common Lord and Master of us all and the certain hope of his approbation first and chiefest to be sought" Milton was not a being of that common and reptile class who assume an affected devotion as the mask of malignity In addressing his second treatise also to the Parliament he describes himself as a man under the protection of the legislative assembly who had used during eighteen years on all occasions to assert the just rights and freedom both of church and state  Had he been conscious of any base servility to Cromwell he would certainly have abstained from this manly assertion of his own patriotic integrity which in that case would have been only ridiculous and contemptible His opinions might be erroneous and his ardent mind over heated but no man ever maintained with more steadiness and resolution the native dignity of an elevated spirit no man more sedulously endeavoured to discharge his duty both to earth and heaven  In February he published The ready and easy Way to establish a Free Commonwealth a work not approved even by republican writers I will only make one observation upon it the motto to this performance seems to display the just opinion that Milton entertained concerning the tyranny of Cromwell  et nos  Consilium Syllae dedimus demus populo nunc  e'en we have given  Counsel to Syllato the people now  a very happy allusion to the noble but neglected advice which he bestowed on the Protector  Amidst the various political distractions towards the end of the year he addressed a letter to a nameless friend who had conversed with him the preceding evening on the dangerous ruptures of the commonwealth This letter and a brief paper containing a sketch of a commonwealth addressed to general Monk were soon after the author's  death communicated by his nephew to Toland who imparted them to the public  Milton gave yet another proof of his unwearied attention to public affairs by publishing brief notes on a sermon preached by Dr Griffith at Mercer's Chapel March th  wherein says the annotator many notorious wrestings of scripture and other falsities are observed  When the repeated protestations of Monk to support the republic had ended in his introduction of the king the anxious friends of Milton who thought the literary champion of the parliament might be exposed to revenge from the triumphant royalists hurried him into concealment The solicitude of those who watched over his safety was so great that it is said they deceived his enemies by a report of his death and effectually prevented a search for his person during the first tumultuary and vindictive rage of the royalists by a pretended funeral A few weeks before the restoration probably in April he quitted his house in Westminster and did not appear in public again till after the act of oblivion which passed on the th of August In this important interval some events occurred which greatly affected both his security and reputation The House of Commons on the th of June manifested their resentment against his person as well as his writings by ordering the attorney general to commence a prosecution against him and petitioning the king that his two books the Defence of the People and his Answer to Eikon Basilike might be publicly burnt  Happily for the honour of England the person of the great author was more fortunate than his writings in escaping from the fury of persecution Within three days after the burning of his books he found himself relieved from the necessity of concealment and sheltered under the common protection of the law by the general act of indemnity which had not included his name in the list of exceptions It has been thought wonderful by many that a writer whose celebrated compositions had rendered him an object of abhorrence to the royal party could elude the activity of their triumphant revenge and various conjectures have been started to account for the safety of Milton after his enemies had too plainly discovered an inclination to crush him One of these conjectural causes of his escape represents two contemporary poets in so amiable a light that though I am unable to confirm the anecdote entirely by any new evidence I shall yet dwell upon it with pleasure Richardson whose affectionate veneration for the genius and virtue he celebrates makes ample amends for all the quaintness of his style has the following passage on the subject in question  Perplexed and inquisitive as I was I at length found the secret which he from whom I had it thought he had communicated to me long ago and wondered he had not I will no longer keep you in expectation'twas Sir William Davenant obtained his remission in return for his own life procured by Milton's interest when himself was under condemnation anno a life was owing to Milton Davenant's and 'twas paid nobly Milton's for Davenant's at Davenant's intercessionIt  will now be expected I should declare what authority I have for this storymy first answer is Mr Pope told it me Whence had he it From Mr BettertonSir William was his patronBetterton was prentice to a bookseller John Holden the same who printed Davenant's Gondibert There Sir William saw him and persuading his master to part with him brought him first on the stage Betterton then may be well allowed to know this transaction from the fountain head  On this interesting anecdote Johnson makes the following remark  Here is a reciprocation of generosity and gratitude so pleasing that the tale makes its own way to credit but if help were wanted I know not where to find it the danger of Davenant is certain from his own relation but of his escape there is no account  This passage of the critical biographer affords a singular proof that he is sometimes as inaccurate in narration as he is defective in sentiment Impressed as I am with the clearest conviction of his repeated endeavours to depreciate the character of Milton I will not suppose that Johnson could designedly suppress an evidence of the poet's generosity which while he is speaking of it in terms of admiration he still endeavours to render problematical yet certain it is that of Milton's protection of Davenant a very obvious evidence exists in Antony Wood who says under the article Davenant  he was carried prisoner to the Isle of Wight anno and afterwards to the Tower of London in order to be tried for his life in the High Court of Justice anno but upon the mediation of John  Milton and others especially two godly aldermen of York to whom he had shewn great civility when they had been taken prisoners in the north by some of the forces under William Marquis of Newcastle he was saved and had liberty allowed him as a prisoner at large  Thus far the pleasing story is sufficiently proved to the honour of Milton That Davenant endeavoured to return the favour is highly probable from the amiable tenderness and benevolent activity of his character Perhaps this probability may seem a little strengthened by the following verses of Davenant in a poem addressed to the king on his happy return  Your clemency has taught us to believe  It wise as well as virtuous to forgive  And now the most offended shall proceed  In great forgiving till no laws we need  For laws slow progresses would quickly end  Could we forgive as fast as men offend  If Davenant was in any degree instrumental to the security of Milton it is probable that he served him rather from gratitude than affection as no two writers of the time were more different from each other in their religious and political opinions That the poetlaureat of Charles was utterly unconscious of those inestimable poetic powers which the blind secretary of the republic was providentially reserved to display we may infer from a very remarkable couplet towards the close of a second poem addressed by  Davenant to the King where speaking of Homer he ventures to assert that  Heav'n ne'er made but one who being blind  Was  it to be a painter of the mind  It is however very possible that Davenant might doubly conduce  the production of Paradise Lost first as one of those who excited their influence to secure the author from molestation and secondly as affording by his Gondibert an incentive to the genius of Milton to shew how infinitely he could surpass a poem which Hobbs whose opinions he despised had extravagantly extolled as the most exquisite production of the epic muse In Aubrey's manuscript anecdotes of Milton it is said that he began his Paradise Lost about two years before the return of the king and finished it about three years after that event the account appears the more probable as the following lines in the commencement of the seventh book pathetically allude to his present situation  More safe I sing with mortal voice unchang'd  To hoarse or mute though fall'n on evil days  On evil days though fall'n and evil tongues  In darkness and with dangers compass'd round  And solitude yet not alone while thou  Visit'st my slumbers nightly or when morn  Purples the east still govern thou my song  Urania and fit audience find though few  But drive far off the barbarous dissonance  Of Bacchus and his revellers the race  Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard  In Rhodope where rocks and woods had ears  To rapture till the savage clamour drown'd  Both harp and voice nor could the Muse defend  Her son so fail not thou who thee implores  For thou art heav'nly she an empty dream  How peculiarly affecting are these beautiful verses when the history of the poet suggests that he probably wrote them while he was concealed in an obscure corner of the city that resounded with the triumphant roar of his intoxicated enemies among whom drunkenness arose to such extravagance that even the festive royalists found it necessary to issue a proclamation which forbade the drinking of healths How poignant at this time must have been the personal and patriotic feelings of Milton who had passed his life in animating himself and his country to habits of temperance truth and public virtue yet had the mortification or finding that country so dear to him now doubly disgraced first by the hypocrisy and treacherous ambition of republicans to whose pretended virtues he had given too easy credit and now by the mean licentious servility of royalists whose more open though not more dangerous vices his upright and hightoned spirit had ever held in abhorrence For his country he had every thing to apprehend from the blind infatuation with which the parliament had rejected the patriotic suggestion of Hale afterwards the illustrious chief justice to establish constitutional limitations  to the power of the king at the critical period of his reception The neglect of this measure contributed not a little to subsequent evils and the reign of Charles the S  cond was in truth deformed with all the public misery and disgrace which Milton had predicted when he argued on the idea of his readmission For his own person the literary champion of the people had no less to dread from the barbarity of public vengeance or from the private dagger of some overheated royalist who like the assassins of Dorislaus in Holland and of Ascham in Spain might think it meritorious to seize any opportunity of destroying a servant of the English republic When royal government restored to itself could yet descend to authorise a mean and execrable indignity against the dead body of a man so magnanimous and so innocent as Blake it was surely natural and by no means unbecoming the spirit of Milton to speak as he does in the preceding verses of evil days and evil tongues of darkness and of danger  This darkness says Johnson had his eyes been better employed had undoubtedly deserved compassion  What had Milton no title to compassion for his personal calamity because he had nobly sacrificed his sight to what he esteemed an important discharge of his public dutyOh egregious morality to which no feeling heart can subscribe No say his implacable enemies he lost his eyes in the vindication of wickedness but admitting their assertion in its full force justice and humanity still contend that instead of diminishing it rather doubles his claim to compassion to suffer in a spirited defence of guilt that we mistake and  esteem as virtue is perhaps of all pitiable misfortunes what a candid and considerate mind should be most willing to pity  But Johnson proceeds to say  of evil tongues for Milton to complain required impudence at least equal to his other powers Milton whose warmest advocates must allow that he never spared any asperity of reproach or brutality of insolence  These are perhaps the most bitter words that were ever applied by an author illustrious himself for great talents and still more for christian virtue to a character preeminent in genius and in piety By shewing to what a marvellous degree a very cultivated and devout mind may be exasperated by party rage may they serve to caution every fervid spirit against that outrageous animosity which a difference of sentiment in politics and religion is so apt to produce It would seem almost an affront to the memory of Milton to vindicate him elaborately from a charge whose very words exhibit so palpable a violation of decency and truth  His coldest advocates instead of allowing that he never spared any brutality of insolence may rather contend that his native tenderness of heart and very graceful education rendered it hardly possible for him at any time to be insolent and brutal It would have been wonderful indeed had he not written with some degree of asperity when his antagonist Salmasius asserted that he ought to suffer an ignominious and excruciating death Against the unfortunate but not innocent Charles the First he expressly declares  that he published nothing till after his decease and that he meant not as he says in one of his Latin works to insult the Manes of the king is indeed evident to an unprejudiced reader from the following very beautiful and pathetic sentence with which he begins his answer to the Eikon Basilike  "To descant on the misfortunes of a person fallen from so high a dignity who hath also paid his final debt both to nature and his faults is neither of itself a thing commendable nor the intention of this discourse" Those who fairly consider the exasperated state of the contending parties when Milton wrote and compare his political compositions with the savage ribaldry of his opponents however mistaken they may think him in his ideas of government will yet find more reason to admire his temper than to condemn his asperity  If in a quiet study at a very advanced period of life and at the distance of more than a century from the days of the republic if a philosopher so situated could be hurried by political heat to speak of Milton with such harsh intemperance of language though writing under the friendly title of his biographer with what indulgence ought we to view that asperity in Milton himself which arose from the immediate pressure of public oppression and of private outrage for his spirit had been enflamed not only by the sight of many national vexations but by seeing his own moral character attacked with the most indecent and execrable calumny that can incite the indignation of insulted virtue If the fascinating powers of his sacred poem and the lustre  of his integrity have failed to soften the virulence of an aged moralist against him in our days what must he not have had to apprehend from the raging passions of his own time when his poetical genius had not appeared in its meridian splendor and when most of his writings were considered as recent crimes against those who were entering on their career of triumph and revenge Johnson indeed asserts in his barbarous censure of Milton's exquisite picture of his own situation that the poet in speaking of his danger was ungrateful and unjust that the charge itself seems to be false for it would be hard to recollect any reproach cast upon him either serious or ludicrous through the whole remaining part of his life yet Lauder once the associate of Johnson in writing against Milton expressly affirms that it was warmly debated for three days whether he should suffer death with the regicides or not as many contended that his guilt was superior to theirs Lauder indeed mentions no authority for his assertion and the word of a man so supremely infamous would deserve no notice were not the circumstance rendered probable by the rancour and atrocity of party spirit To what detestable excesses this spirit could proceed we have not only an example in Lauder himself of whose malignity to the poet I shall have subsequent occasion to speak but in that collection of virulent invectives against Milton composed chiefly by his contemporaries which Lauder added as an appendix to his own most malignant pamphlet The most singular and indecent of these invectives whose scurrility is too gross to be transcribed has been imputed to that very copious writer Sir Roger  L'Estrange and if a pen employed so savagely against Milton could obtain public encouragement and applause he might surely without affectation or timidity think himself exposed to the dagger of some equally hostile and more sanguinary royalist L'Estrange for such sufferings in the cause of royalty as really entitled him to reward obtained not long after the restoration the revived but unconstitutional office of licenser to the press It was happy for literature that he possessed not that oppressive jurisdiction when the author of the Paradise Lost was obliged to solicit an imprimatur since the excess of his malevolence to Milton might have then exerted itself in such a manner as to entitle both the office and its possessor to the execration of the world The licenser of that period Thomas Tomkyns chaplain to archbishop Sheldon though hardly so full of rancour as L'Estrange if L'Estrange was the real author of the ribaldry ascribed to him was absurd or malignant enough to obstruct in some measure the publication of Paradise Lost "He among other frivolous exceptions says Toland would needs suppress the whole poem for imaginary treason in the following lines  as when the sun new risen  Looks thro' the horizontal misty air  Shorn of his heams or from behind the moon  In dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds  On half the nations and with fear of change  Perplexes monarchs  By what means the poet was happily enabled to triumph over the malevolence of an enemy in office we are not informed by the author who has recorded this very interesting anecdote but from the peril to which his immortal work was exposed and which the mention of a licenser to the press has led me to anticipate let us return to his personal danger the extent of this danger and the particulars of his escape have never been completely discovered The account that his nephew gives of him at this momentous period is chiefly contained in the following sentence  "It was a friend's house in Bartholomew Close where he lived till the act of oblivion came forth which it pleased God proved as favourable to him as could be hoped or expected through the intercession of some that stood his friends both in council and parliament particularly in the House of Commons Mr Andrew Marvel a member for Hull acted vigorously in his behalf and made a considerable party for him"  Marvel like the superior author whom he so nobly protected was himself a poet and a patriot He had been associated with Milton in the office of Latin secretary in and cultivated his friendship by a tender and respectful attachment As he probably owed to that friendship the improvement of his own talents and virtues it is highly pleasing to find that he exerted them on different occasions in establishing the security and in celebrating the genius of his incomparable friend His efforts of regard on the present emergency are liberally described in the preceding expression of Philips and his friendly verses on the publication  of the Paradise Lost deserve no common applause for the records of literature hardly exhibit a more just a more spirited or a more generous compliment paid by one poet to another  But the friendship of Marvel vigilant active and beneficial as it was could not secure Milton from being seized and hurried into confinement It appears from the minutes of the House of Commons that he was prisoner to their serjeant on the th of December The particulars of his imprisonment are involved in darkness but Dr Birch whose copious life of Milton is equally full of intelligence and candour conjectures with great probability that on his appearing in public after the act of indemnity and adjournment of Parliament on the th of September he was seized in consequence of the order formerly given by the Commons for his prosecution  The exact time of his continuing in custody no researches have ascertained The records of Parliament only prove that on the th of December the House ordered his release but the same upright and undaunted spirit which had made Milton in his younger days a resolute opposer of injustice and oppression still continued a characteristic of his declining life and now induced him disadvantageously situated as he was for such a contest to resist the rapacity of the parliamentary officer who endeavoured to extort from him an exorbitant see on his discharge He remonstrated to the house on the iniquity of their servant and as the affair was referred to the committee of privileges  he probably obtained the redress that he had the courage to demand  In this fortunate escape from the grasp of triumphant and vindictive power Milton may be considered as terminating his political life commencing from his return to the continent it had extended to a period of twenty years in three of these he had been afflicted with partial but increasing blindness and in six he had been utterly blind His exertions in this period of his life had exposed him to infinite obloquy but his generous and enlightened country whatever may be the state of her political opinions will remember with becoming equity and pride that the sublimest of her poets though deceived as he certainly was by extraordinary pretenders to public virtue and subject to great illusion in his ideas of government is entitled to the first of encomiums the praise of being truly an honest man since it was assuredly his constant aim to be the steady disinterested adherent and encomiast of truth and justice hence we find him continually displaying those internal blessings which have been happily called "the clear witnesses of a benign nature" an innocent conscience and a satisfied understanding  Such is the imperfection of human existence that mistaken notions and principles are perfectly compatible with elevation integrity and satisfaction of mind The writer must be a slave of prejudice or a sycophant to power who would represent Milton as deficient in any of these noble endowments Even Addison seems to lose his rare Christian candour and Hume his philosophical precision when  these two celebrated though very different authors speak harshly of Milton's political character without paying due acknowledgment to the rectitude of his heart I trust the probity of a very ardent but uncorrupted enthusiast is in some measure vindicated in the course of these pages happy if they promote the completion of his own manly wish to be perfectly known if they impress a just and candid estimate of his merits and mistakes on the temperate mind of his country  END OF THE SECOND PART  PART III  E'PER VECCHIEZZA IN LUI VIRTU NON MANCA  DRITTO EI TENEVA IN VERSO IL CIEL IL VOLTO  TASSO  IN beginning to contemplate the latter years of Milton it may be useful to remark that they afford perhaps the most animating lesson which biography instructive as it is can supply they shew to what noble use a cultivated and religious mind may convert even declining life though embittered by a variety of afflictions and darkened by personal calamity  On regaining his liberty he took a house in Holborn near Red Lion Fields but soon removed to Jewinstreet and there married in his th year his third wife Elizabeth Minshall the daughter of a gentleman in Cheshire As the misfortune of blindness seems particularly to require a female companion and yet almost precludes the unhappy sufferer from selecting such as might suit him Milton is said to have formed this attachment on the recommendation of his friend Dr Paget an eminent physician of the city to whom the lady was related Some biographers have spoken harshly of her temper and conduct but let me observe in justice to her memory that the manuscript of Aubrey to whom she was probably known mentions her as a gentle person of a peaceful and agreeable humour  That she was particularly attentive to her husband and treated his infirmities with tenderness is candidly remarked by Mr Warton in a posthumous note to the testamentary papers relating to Milton which his indefatigable researches at length discovered and committed to the press a few months before his own various and valuable labours were terminated by death These very curious and interesting papers afford information respecting the latter days of the poet which his late biographers were so far from possessing that they could not believe it existed Indeed Mr Warton himself had concluded that all farther enquiries for the will must be fruitless as he had failed in a tedious and intricate search At last however he was enabled by the friendship of Sir William Scott to rescue from oblivion a curiosity so precious to poetical antiquarians He found in the prerogative register the will of Milton which though made by his brother Christopher a lawyer by profession was set aside from a deficiency in point of formthe litigation of this will produced a collection of evidence relating to the testator which renders the discovery of those long forgotten papers peculiarly interesting they shew very forcibly and in new points of view his domestic infelicity and his amiaable disposition The tender and sublime poet whose sensibility and sufferings were so great appears to have been almost as unfortunate in his daughters as the Lear of Shakespeare A servant declares in evidence that her deceased master a little before his last marriage had lamented to her the ingratitude and cruelty of his children He complained  that they combined to defraud him in the oeconomy of his house and sold several of his books in the basest manner His feelings on such an outrage both as a parent and as a scholar must have been singularly painful perhaps they suggested to him those very pathetic lines where he seems to paint himself in Sampson Agonistes  I dark in light expos'd  To daily fraud contempt abuse and wrong  Within doors or without still as a fool  In power of others never in my own  Scarce half I seem to live dead more than half  Unfortunate as he had proved in matrimony he was probably induced to venture once more into that state by the bitter want of a domestic protector against his inhuman daughters under which description I include only the two eldest and in palliation even of their conduct detestable as it appears we may observe that they are entitled to pity as having been educated without the inestimable guidance of maternal tenderness under a father afflicted with loss of sight they were also young at the time of Milton's last marriage his eldest daughter had only reached the age of fifteen and Deborah his favourite was still a child of nine years  His new connection seems to have afforded him what he particularly sought that degree of domestic tranquillity and comfort essential to his perseverance in study which appears to have been through all the vicissitudes of fortune  the prime object of his life and while all his labours were under the direction of religion or of philanthropy there was nothing too arduous or too humble for his mind In he published a little work entitled "Accidence commenced Grammar" benevolently calculated for the relief of children by shortening their very tedious and irksome progress in learning the elements of Latin He published also in the same year another brief composition of Sir Walter Raleigh's containing like the former work of that celebrated man which the same editor had given to the public a series of political maxims one of these I am tempted to transcribe by a persuasion that Milton regarded it with peculiar pleasure from its tendency to justify the parliamentary contention with Charles the First Had the misguided monarch observed the maxim of Raleigh he would not like that illustrious victim to the vices of his royal father have perished on the scaffoldThe maxim is the seventeenth of the collection and gives the following instruction to a prince for preserving an hereditary kingdom  "To be moderate in his taxes and impositions and when need doth require to use the subjects purse to do it by parliament and with their consent making the cause apparent to them and shewing his unwillingness in charging them Finally so to use it that it may seem rather an offer from his subjects than an exaction by him"  However vehement the enmity of various persons against Milton might have been during the tumult of passions on the recent restoration there is great reason to believe that  his extraordinary abilities and probity so far triumphed over the prejudices against him that with all his republican offences upon his head he might have been admitted to royal favour had he been willing to accept it Richardson relates on very good authority that the post of Latin secretary in which he had obtained so much credit as a scholar was again offered to him after the Restoration that he rejected it and replied to his wife who advised his acceptance of the appointment "You as other women would ride in your coach for me my aim is to live and die an honest man" Johnson discovers an inclination to discredit this story because it does honour to Milton and seemed inconsistent with his own ideas of probability "He that had shared authority either with the Parliament or Cromwell" says Johnson "might have forborne to talk very loudly of his honesty" How miserably narrow is the prejudice that cannot allow perfect honesty to many individuals on both sides in a contest like that which divided the nation in the civil wars Undoubtedly there were men in each party and men of great mental endowments who acted during that calamitous contention according to the genuine dictates of conscience Those who examine the conduct of Milton with impartiality will be ready to allow that he possessed not only one of the most cultivated but one of the most upright minds which the records of human nature have taught us to revere His retaining his employment under Cromwell has I trust been so far justified that it can no more be represented as a blemish on his integrity His office indeed was of such a nature that he might without  a breach of honesty have resumed it under the king but his return to it though not absolutely dishonourable would have ill accorded with that refined purity and elevation of character which from his earliest youth it was the noblest ambition of Milton to acquire and support He would have lost much of his title to the reverence of mankind for his magnanimity had he accepted his former office under Charles the Second whom he must have particularly despised as a profligate and servile tyrant as ready to betray the honour of the nation as he was careless of his own a personage whom Milton could never have beheld without horror on reflecting on his singular barbarity to his celebrated friend that eccentric but interesting character Sir Henry Vane The king so extolled for his mercy had granted the life of Sir Henry to the joint petition of the Lords and Commons but after promising to preserve him signed a warrant for his executionone of the most inhuman and detestable acts of duplicity that was ever practised against a subject by his sovereign It is to the fate of Vane with others of that party and to his own personal sufferings that the great poet alludes in the following admirable reflections assigned to the chorus in his Sampson Agonistes  Many are the sayings of the wise  In antient and in modern books enroll'd  Extolling patience as the truest fortitude  And to the bearing well of all calamities  All chances incident to man's frail life  Consolatories writ  With studied argument and much persuasion sought  Lenient of grief and anxious thought  But with th' afflicted in his pangs their sound  Little prevails or rather seems a tune  Harsh and of dissonant mood from his complaint  Unless he feel within  Some source of consolation from above  Secret refreshings that repair his strength  And fainting spirits uphold  God of our fathers what is man  That thou towards him with hand so various  Or might I say contrarious  Temperest thy Providence through his short course  Not evenly as thou rul'st  The angelic orders and inferior creatures mute  Irrational and brute  Nor do I name of men the common rout  That wand'ring loose about  Grow up and perish as the summer fly  Heads without name no more remembered  But such as thou hast solemnly elected  With gifts and graces eminently adorn'd  To some great work thy glory  And people's safety which in part they effect  Yet toward these thus dignified thou oft  Amidst their heighth of noon  Changest thy countenance and thy hand with no regard  Of highest favours past  From thee on them or them to thee of service  Nor only dost degrade them or remit  To life obscur'd which were a fair dismission  But throw'st them lower than thou didst exalt them high  Unseemly falls in human eye  Too grievous for the trespass or omission  Oft leav'st them to the hostile sword  Of heathen and profane their carcases  To dogs and fowls a prey or else captiv'd  Or to th' unjust tribunals under change of times  And condemnation of th' ungrateful multitude  If these they scape perhaps in poverty  With sickness and disease thou bow'st them down  Painful diseases and deform'd  In crude old age  Though not disordinate yet causeless suff'ring  The punishment of dissolute days  Warburton was the first I believe to remark how exactly these concluding lines describe the situation of the poet himself afflicted by his loss of property and "his gout not caused by intemperance" The same acute but very unequal critic is by no means so happy in his observation that Milton seems to have chosen the subject of this sublime drama for the sake of the satire on bad wives it would be hardly less absurd to say that he chose the subject of Paradise Lost for the sake of describing a connubial altercation The nephew of Milton has told us that he could not ascertain the time when this drama was written but it probably flowed from the heart of the indignant  poet soon after his spirit had been wounded by the calamitous destiny of his friends to which he alludes with so much energy and pathos He did not design the drama for a theatre nor has it the kind of action requisite for theatrical interest but in one point of view the Sampson Agonistes is the most singularly affecting composition that was ever produced by sensibility of heart and vigour of imagination To give it this peculiar effect we must remember that the lot of Milton had a marvellous coincidence with that of his hero in three remarkable points first but we should regard this as the most inconsiderable article of resemblance he had been tormented by a beautiful but disaffectionate and disobedient wife secondly he had been the great champion of his country and as such the idol of public admiration lastly he had fallen from that heighth of unrivalled glory and had experienced the most humiliating reverse of fortune  His foes' derision captive poor and blind  In delineating the greater part of Sampson's sensations under calamity he had only to describe his own No dramatist can have ever conformed so literally as Milton to the Horatian precept  Si vis me flere dolendum est  Primum ipsi tibi  And if in reading the Sampson Agonistes we observe how many passages expressed with the most energetic sensibility  exhibit to our fancy the sufferings and real sentiments of the poet as well as those of his hero we may derive from this extraordinary composition a kind of pathetic delight that no other drama can afford we may applaud the felicity of genius that contrived in this manner to relieve a heart overburthened with anguish and indignation and to pay a half concealed yet hallowed tribute to the memories of dear though dishonoured friends whom the state of the times allowed not the afflicted poet more openly to deplore  The concluding verses of the beautiful chorus which I have already cited in part appear to me particularly affecting from the persuasion that Milton in composing them addressed the two last immediately to Heaven as a prayer for himself  In fine  Just or unjust alike seem miserable  For oft alike both come to evil end  So deal not with this once thy glorious champion  The image of thy strength and mighty minister  What do I beg how hast thou dealt already  Behold him in his state calamitous and turn  His labours for thou can'st to peaceful end  If the conjecture of this application be just we may add that never was the prevalence of a righteous prayer more happily conspicuous and let me here remark that however various the opinions of men may be concerning the  merits or demerits of Milton's political character the integrity of his heart appears to have secured to him the favour of Providence since it pleased the Giver of all good not only to turn his labours to a peaceful end but to irradiate his declining life with the most abundant portion of those pure and sublime mental powers for which he had constantly and fervently prayed as the choicest bounty of Heaven  At this period his kind friend and physician who had proved so serviceable to him in the recommendation of an attentive and affectionate wife introduced to his notice a young reader of Latin in that singular character Thomas Ellwood the quaker who has written a minute history of his own life a book which suggests the reflection how strangely a writer may sometimes mistake his way in his endeavours to engage the attention of posterity Had the honest quaker bequeathed to the world as circumstantial an account of his great literary friend as he has done of himself his book would certainly have engrossed no common share of public regard we are indebted to him however for his incidental mention of the great poet and as there is a pleasing air of simplicity and truth in his narrative I shall gratify the reader by inserting it with very little abridgment  "JOHN MILTON a gentleman of great note for learning throughout the learned world having filled a public station in former times lived now a private and retired life in London and having wholly lost his sight kept always a man  to read to him which usually was the son of some gentleman of his acquaintance whom in kindness he took to improve in his learning  "By the mediation of my friend Isaac Penington with Dr Paget and of Dr Paget with John Milton was I admitted to come to him not as a servant to him which at that time he needed not nor to be in the house with him but only to have the liberty of coming to his house at certain hours when I would and to read to him what books he should appoint me which was all the favour I desired"  Ellwood was at this time an ingenuous but undisciplined young man about threeandtwentyhis father a justice of Oxfordshire had taken him very unseasonably from school with a view to lessen his own expences and this his younger son after wasting some years at home attached himself with great fervency to the sect of quakers His religious ardour involved him in a long and painful quarrel with his father and in many singular adventureshe united with his pious zeal a lively regard for literature and being grieved to find that his interrupted education had permitted him to acquire but a slender portion of classical learning he anxiously sought the acquaintance of Milton in the hope of improving it  "I went therefore says the candid quaker and took myself a lodging near to his house which was then in Jewinstreet as conveniently as I could and from thence forward went every day in the afternoon except on the first days of the week and sitting by him in his diningroom read to  him such books in the Latin tongue as he pleased to hear me read  "At my first sitting to read to him observing that I used the English pronunciation he told me if I would have the benefit of the Latin tongue not only to read and understand Latin authors but to converse with foreigners either abroad or at home I must learn the foreign pronunciation to this I consenting he instructed me how to sound the vowels this change of pronunciation proved a new difficulty to me but  Labor omnia vincit  Improbus  And so did I which made my reading the more acceptable to my master He on the other hand perceiving with what earnest desire I pursued learning gave me not only all the encouragement but all the help he could for having a curious ear he understood by my tone when I understood what I read and when I did not and accordingly would stop me examine me and open the most difficult passages to me"  The clearness and simplicity of Ellwood's narrative brings us as it were into the company of Milton and shews in a very agreeable point of view the native courtesy and sweetness of a temper that has been strangely misrepresented as morose and austere  Johnson with his accustomed asperity to Milton discovers an inclination to censure him for his mode of teaching  Latin to Ellwood but Milton who was instructing an indigent young man had probably very friendly reasons for wishing him to acquire immediately the foreign pronunciation and assuredly the patience good nature and success with which he condescended to teach this singular attendant do credit both to the disciple and the preceptor  Declining health soon interrupted the studies of Ellwood and obliged him to retire to the house of a friend and physician in the country Here after great suffering from sickness he revived and returned again to London  "I was very kindly received by my Master continues the interesting quaker who had conceived so good an opinion of me that my conversation I found was acceptable and he seemed heartily glad of my recovery and return and into our old method of study we fell again I reading to him and he explaining to me as occasion required"  But learning as poor Ellwood observes was almost a forbidden fruit to him His intercourse with Milton was again interrupted by a second calamity a party of soldiers rushed into a meeting of quakers that included this unfortunate scholar and he was hurried with his friends from prison to prison Though tenpence was all the money he possessed his honest pride prevented his applying to Milton for relief in this exigence and he contrived to support himself by his industry in confinement with admirable fortitude  Moderate prosperity however visited at last this honest and devout man affording him an agreeable opportunity  of being useful to the great poet who had deigned to be his preceptor  An affluent quaker who resided at Chalfont in Buckinghamshire settled Ellwood in his family to instruct his children and in when the pestilence raged in London Milton requested his friendly disciple to find a refuge for him in his neighbourhood  "I took a pretty box for him" says this affectionate friend "in Giles Chalfont a mile from me of which I gave him notice and intended to have waited on him and seen him well settled in it but was prevented by imprisonment"  This was a second captivity that the unfortunate young man had to sustain for in consequence of a recent and most iniquitous persecution of the quakers he was apprehended at the funeral of a friend and confined in the gaol of Aylesbury  "But being now released" continues Elwood "I soon made a visit to him to welcome him into the country  After some common discourses had passed between us he called for a manuscript of his which being brought he delivered to me bidding me take it home with me and read it at my leisure and when I had so done return it to him with my judgment thereupon  "When I came home and set myself to read it I found it was that excellent poem which he entitled Paradise Lost  "After I had with the best attention read it through I made him another visit and returned him his book with due acknowledgment of the favour he had done me in communicating it to me He asked me how I liked it and  what I thought of it which I modestly and freely told him and after some farther discourse about it I pleasantly said to him 'Thou hast said much here of Paradise lost but what hast thou to say of Paradise found' He made me no answer but sat some time in a muse then brake off that discourse and fell upon another subject  "After the sickness was over and the city well cleansed and become safely habitable again he returned thither and when afterwards I went to wait on him there which I seldom failed of doing whenever my occasions led me to London he shewed me his second poem called Paradise Regain'd and in a pleasant tone said to me 'This is owing to you for you put it into my head by the question you put to me at Chalfont which before I had not thought of'"  The personal regard of this ingenuous quaker for Milton and his giving birth to a composition of such magnitude and merit as Paradise Regain'd entitle him to distinction in a life of his great poetical friend and I have therefore rather transcribed than abridged his relation My reader I doubt not will join with me in wishing that we had more sketches of the venerable bard thus minutely delineated from the life in the colours of fidelity and affection  The last of Milton's familiar letters in Latin relates to this period it speaks with devotional gratitude of the safe asylum from the plague which he had found in the country it speaks also with so much feeling of his past political adventures and of the present inconvenience which he suffered from the loss of sight that I apprehend an entire translation of it  can hardly fail of being acceptable to the English reader It is dated from London August and addressed to Heimbach an accomplished German who is stiled counsellor to the elector of Brandenburgh An expression in a former letter to the same correspondent seems to intimate that this learned foreigner who visited England in his youth had resided with Milton perhaps in the character of a discipleBut here is the interesting letter  Ornatissimo Viro Petro Heimbachio Electoris Brandenburgici Consiliario  Si inter tot funera popularium meorum anno tam gravi ac pestilenti

expectation has advanced you so far in the honourable favour of your prince For your prosperity in every other point you have both my wishes and my hopes Farewell  "London August "  How interesting is this complaint when we recollect that the great writer reduced to such irksome difficulties in regard to his secretary was probably engaged at this period in polishing the sublimest of poems  From Ellwood's account it appears that Paradise Lost was complete in Philips and Toland assert that it was actually published the following year but I believe no copy has been found of a date so early The first edition on the list of the very accurate Mr Loft was printed by Peter Parker in and probably at the expence of the author who sold the work to Samuel Simmons by a contract dated the th of April in the same year  The terms of this contract are such as a lover of genius can hardly hear without a sigh of pity and indignation The author of the Paradise Lost received only an immediate payment of five pounds for a work which is the very masterpiece of sublime and refined imagination a faculty not only naturally rare but requiring an extraordinary coincidence of circumstances to cherish and strengthen it for the long and regular exercise essential to the production of such a poem The bookseller's agreement however entitled the author to a conditional payment of fifteen pounds more five to be paid after the sale of thirteen hundred copies of the first edition and five in the same manner both on a second and a third The number of each edition was limited to fifteen hundred copies  The original size of the publication was a small quarto and the poem was at first divided into ten books but in the second edition the author very judiciously increased the  number to twelve by introducing a pause in the long narration of the seventh and of the tenth so that each of these books became two  Simmons was a printer and his brief advertisement to the work he had purchased is curious enough to merit insertion  "Courteous Reader there was no argument at first intended to the book but for the satisfaction of many that have desired it I have procured it and withal a reason of that which stumbled many others why the poem rhymes not" Here we may plainly see that the novelty of blank verse was considered as an unpalatable innovation The book however advanced so far in its sale that thirteen hundred were dispersed in two years In April the author received his second payment of five pounds The second edition came forth in the year of his death and the third in four years after that event his widow who inherited a right to the copy sold all her claims to Simmons for eight pounds in December so that twentyeight pounds paid at different times in the course of thirteen years is the whole pecuniary reward which this great performance produced to the poet and his widow  But although the emolument which the author derived from his noblest production was most deplorably inadequate to its merit he was abundantly gratified with immediate and fervent applause from several accomplished judges of poetical genius It has been generally supposed that Paradise Lost was neglected to a mortifying degree on its first appearance and that the exalted poet consoled his spirit  under such mortification by a magnanimous confidence in the justice of future ages and a sanguine anticipation of his poetical immortality The strength and dignity of his mind would indeed have armed him against any possible disappointment of his literary ambition but such was the reception of his work that he could not be disappointed Johnson has vindicated the public on this point with judgment and success  The sale of books he observes was not in Milton's age what it is in the present the nation had been satisfied from to that is fortyone years with only two editions of the works of Shakespeare which probably did not together make one thousand copies The sale of thirteen hundred copies in two years in opposition to so much recent enmity and to a style of versification new to all and disgusting to many was an uncommon example of the prevalence of genius  These remarks are perfectly just but when their author proceeds to say  the admirers of Paradise Lost did not dare to publish their opinion  he seems to forget the very spirited eulogies that were during the life of the poet bestowed on that performance Panegyrick can hardly assume a bolder tone than in the English and Latin verses addressed to Milton by Marvel and Barrow He received other compliments not inferior to these The muse of Dryden assured him that he possessed the united excellencies of Homer and of Virgil and if we may rely on an anecdote related by Richardson the Paradise Lost was announced to the world in a very singular manner that may  be thought not illsuited to the preeminence of the work Sir John Denham a man distinguished as a soldier a senator and a poet came into the House of Commons with a proofsheet of Milton's new composition wet from the press and being questioned concerning the paper in his hand he said it was  part of the noblest poem that ever was written in any language or in any age  Richardson whose active and liberal affection for the poet led him to search with intelligent alacrity and success for every occurrence that could redound to his honour has recorded another incident which must be particularly interesting to every lover of literary anecdote as it discovers how the Paradise Lost was first introduced to Dryden and with what fervency of admiration he immediately spoke of it The Earl of Dorset and Fleetwood Shepard the friend of Prior sound the poem according to this story at a bookseller's in Little Britain who lamenting its want of circulation entreated the Earl to recommend it Dorset after reading it himself sent it to Dryden who said in returning the book "This man cuts us all out and the ancients too" These were probably the real sentiments of Dryden on his first perusal of the poem but as that unhappy genius was not blest with the independent magnanimity of Milton his opinions were apt to fluctuate according to his interest and we find him occasionally disposed to exalt or degrade the transcendent performance which he could not but admire As the six celebrated verses in which he has complimented the English Homer so much resemble what he said of him to Lord Dorset it is probable that those verses were written  while his mind was glowing with admiration from his first survey of the Paradise Lost and as long as Milton lived Dryden seems to have paid him the deference so justly due to his age his genius and his virtue Aubrey relates in the manuscript which I have repeatedly cited that the poet laureat waited on Milton for the purpose of soliciting his permission to put his Paradise Lost into a drama "Mr Milton says Aubrey received him civilly and told him he would give him leave to tag his verses" an expression that probably alluded to a couplet of Marvel's in his poetical eulogy on his friend The opera which Dryden wrote in consequence of this permission entitled the State of Innocence was not exhibited in the theatre and did not appear in print till two years after the death of Milton who is mentioned in becoming terms of veneration and gratitude in the preface The drama itself is a very singular and striking performance with all the beauties and all the defects of Dryden's animated unequal versification it has peculiar claim to the attention of those who may wish to investigate the respective powers of English rhyme and blank verse and it may furnish arguments to the partizans of each for if in many passages the images and harmony of Milton are deplorably injured by the necessity of rhyming in a few instances perhaps rhyme has imparted even to the ideas of Milton new energy and grace There are prefixt to this opera some very animated but injudicious verses by poor Nat Lee who has lavished the most exaggerated praise on his friend Dryden at the expence of the superior poet  It is highly pleasing to reflect that Milton who had so many evils to sustain in the course of his chequered life had yet the high gratification of being assured by very competent judges that he had gloriously succeeded in the prime object of his literary ambition the great poetical atchievement which he projected in youth and accomplished in old age He probably received such animating assurances from many of his friends whose applause being intended for his private satisfaction has not descended to our time but when we recollect the honours already mentioned that were paid to the living poet by Denham Dryden and Marvel we may rest satisfied in the persuasion that he enjoyed a grateful earnest of his future renown and according to the petition he addressed to Urania  Fit audience found tho' few  If the spirit of a departed bard can be gratified by any circumstances of posthumous renown it might gratify Mil+ton to perceive that his divine poem was first indebted for general celebrity to the admiration of Sommers and of Addison two of the most accomplished and most amiable of English names Sommers promoted the first ornamented edition of Paradise Lost in and Addison wrote his celebrated papers on Milton in  But to return to the living author in the year the great poet aspired to new distinction by appearing in the character of an historianHe had long meditated a work which in his time was particularly wanted in our  language and which the greater cultivation bestowed by the present age on this branch of literature has not yet produced in perfectionan eloquent and impartial history of England Milton executed only six books beginning with the most early fabulous period and closing with the Norman conquest "Why he should have given the first part says Johnson which he seems not to believe and which is universally rejected it is difficult to conjecture" Had the critic taken the trouble to peruse a few pages of the work in question his difficulty would have vanished he would at least have found the motive of the author if he had not esteemed it satisfactory  "I have determined says Milton in speaking of the ancient and rejected British fables to bestow the telling over even of these reputed tales be it for nothing else but in favour of our English poets and rhetoricians who by their art will know how to use them judiciously" This sentiment implies a striking fondness for works of imagination and a good natured disposition to promote them  The historian discovers higher aims as he advances in his work and expresses a moral and patriotic desire to make the lessons suggested by the early calamities of this nation a source of wisdom and virtue to his improving countrymen The very passage which was most likely to produce such an effect was struck out of the publication by the Gothic hand of the licenser an incident that seems to give new energy to all the noble arguments which the injured author had formerly adduced in vindicating the liberty of the press  The passage in question contained a very masterly sketch  of the long parliament and assembly of divines contrasting their situation and their misconduct after the death of Charles the First with those of the ancient Britons when by the departure of the Roman power "they were left according to the expression of the historian to the sway of their own councils" The author gave a copy of this unlicenced parallel to the celebrated Earl of Anglesey a man distinguished by erudition with a liberal respect for genius and though a minister of Charles the Second a frequent visiter of Milton This curious fragment was published in with a short preface declaring that it originally belonged to the third book of Milton's History and in the edition of his prose works in it was properly replaced The poet would have succeeded more eminently as an historian had his talents been exercised on a period more favourable to their exertion We have reason to regret his not having executed the latter part of his original intention instead of dwelling on the meagre and dark annals of Saxon barbarity In his early history however there are passages of great force and beauty his character of Alfred in particular is worthy that engaging model of an accomplished monarch and verifies a sentiment which Milton professed even while he was defending the commonwealth that although a resolute enemy to tyrants he was a since  e friend to such kings as merited the benediction of their people  The attractive merit of Alfred and the affectionate zeal with which Milton appears to have delineated his character form a double motive for inserting it in a note as a specimen of the great author's style in historical composition  "After which troublesome time Alfred enjoyning three years of peace by him spent as his manner was not idly or voluptuously but in all virtuous employments both of mind and body becoming a prince of his renown ended his days in the year nine hund  ed the fiftyfirst of his age the thirtieth of his reign and was buried

than all his brethren of pleasing tongue and graceful behaviour ready wit and memory yet through the fondness of his parents towards him had not been taught to read till the twelfth year of his age but the great desire of learning which was in him soon appeared by his conning of Saxon poems day and night which with great attention he heard by others repeated He was besides excellent at hunting and the new art then of hawking but more exemplary in devotion having collected into a book certain prayers and psalms which he carried ever with him in his bosom to use on all occasions He thirsted after all liberal knowledge and oft complained that in his youth he had no teachers in his middle age so little vacancy from wars and the cares of his kingdom yet leisure he found sometimes not only to learn much himself but to communicate thereof what he could to his people by translating books out of Latin into English Orosius Boethius Beda's history and others permitted none unlearned to bear office either in court or commonwealth At twenty years of age not yet reigning he took to wise Eg  lswitha the daughter of Ethelred a Mercian earl The extremities which besel him in the sixth of his reign Neothan Abbot told him were justly come upon him for neglecting in his younger days the complaint of such as injured and oppressed repaired to him as then second person in the kingdom for redress which neglect were it such indeed were yet excusable in a youth through jollity of mind unwilling perhaps to be detained long with sad and sorrowful narrations but from the time of his undertaking regal charge no man more patient in hearing causes more inquisitive in examining more exact in doing justice and providing good laws which are yet extant more severe in punishing unjust judges or obstinate offenders thieves especially and robbers to the terror of whom in crossways were hung upon a high post certain chains of gold as it were daring any one to take them thence so that justice seemed in his days not to flourish only but to triumph no man can be more frugal of two precious things in man's life his time and his revenue no man wiser in the disposal of both His time the day and night he distributed by the burning of certain tapers into three equal portions the one was for devotion the other for public or private affairs the third for bodily refreshment how each hour past he was put in mind by one who had that office His whole annual revenue which his first care was should be justly his own he divided into two equal parts the first he employed to secular uses and subdivided those into three the first to pay his soldiers household servants and guards of which divided into three bands one attended monthly by turn the second was to pay his architects and workmen whom he had got together of several nations for he was also an elegant builder above the custom and conceit of Englishmen in those days the third he had in readiness to relieve or honour strangers according to their worth who came from all parts to see him and to live under him The other equal part of his yearly  dedicated to religious uses  of  our sorts the first to relieve the poo  the s

relief of foreign churches as far as India to the shrine of St Thomas sending thither Sigal  bishop of Sherburn who both retained saf  and brought with him many rich gems and spices gifts also and a letter he received from the patriarch at Jerusalem sent many to Rome and from them received reliques  has  a  and much m  r  might be said of his noblemen mind which rend  +ed him the minor of  His body w  s dise  ed in his youth with a great for  ness in the seige and that ceasing of itself with another inward pain of unknown c  us  which held him by frequent sits to his dying day yet not d  senabled to sustain those many glorious labours of his life both in peace and war Prose Works Vol II p    In the year after the first appearance of his history he published the Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes  Many groundless remarks have been made on the supposed want of judgment in Milton to form a proper estimate of his own compositions "His last poetical offspring says Johnson was his favourite he could not as Ellwood relates endure to have Paradise Lost preferred to Paradise Regained" In this brief passage there is more than one misrepresentation It is not Ellwood but Philips who speaks of Milton's esteem for his latter poem and instead of saying that the author preferred it to his greater work he merely intimates that Milton was offended with the general censure which condemned the Paradise Regained as infinitely inferior to the other Instead of supposing therefore that the great poet was under the influence of an absurd predilection we have only reason to conclude that he heard with lively scorn such idle witticism as we find recorded by Toland "that Milton might be seen in Paradise Lost but not in Paradise Regained" His own accomplished mind in which sensibility and judgment were proportioned to extraordinary imagination most probably  assured him what is indisputably true that uncommon energy of thought and felicity of composition are apparent in both performances however different in design dimension and effect To censure the Paradise Regained because it does not more resemble the preceding poem is hardly less absurd than it would be to condemn the moon for not being a sun instead of admiring the two different luminaries and feeling that both the greater and the less are visibly the work of the same divine and inimitable power  Johnson has very liberally noticed one peculiarity in Milton and calls it with a benevolent happiness of expression  a kind of humble dignity which did not disdain the meanest services to literature The epic poet the controvertist the politician having already descended to accommodate children with a book of rudiments now in the last years of his life composed a book of Logic for the initiation of students in philosophy and published Artis Logicae plenior Institutio ad Petri Rami Methodum concinnata that is a new scheme of Logic according to the method of Ramus  It is so pleasing to find one great author speaking of another in terms which do honour to both that I transcribe with singular satisfaction the preceding passage of the eminent biographer whose frequent and injurious asperity to Milton I have so repeatedly noticed and must continue to notice with reprehension and regret  In the very moment of delivering the just encomium I have commended the critic discovers an intemperate eagerness  to revile the object of his praise for he proceeds to say of Milton  I know not whether even in this book he did not intend an act of hostility against the universities for Ramus was one of the first oppugners of the old philosophy who disturbed with innovations the quiet of the schools  Is there not a visible want of candour in shewing so wildly a wish to impute a very inoffensive and meritorious work of science to a malevolent motive  Ramus was a man whose writings and memory were justly regarded by Milton for he resembled our great countryman in temperance in fortitude in passion for study and above all in a brave and inflexible opposition to ignorance tyranny and superstition his life was a continued struggle with these merciless enemies and he perished at last with circumstances of peculiar barbarity in the atrocious massacre of St Bartholomew  A desire of rendering justice to the talents and virtues of such a sufferer in the cause of learning might surely be asscribed to Milton as a more probable and becoming motive on this occasion than dark intentions of hostility against the universities It is but a sorry compliment to those universities to insinuate that he engaged in warfare against them who republished a simple and seasonable treatise on the management of human reason Milton with great judgment augmented the logic of Ramus and added to his system an abridgment of the Latin life which Fregius had written of its unfortunate author  The long literary career of Milton was now drawing towards its termination and it closed as it began with a fervent regard to the interest of religionAlarmed by that encroachment which the Romish superstition was making under the connivance of Charles the Second and with the aid of his apostate brother Milton published  A treatise of true Religion Heresy Schism Toleration and the best Means to prevent the Growth of Popery  The patriotic scope of this work was to unite and consolidate the jarring sects of the protestants by persuading them to reciprocal indulgence and to guard them against those impending dangers from Rome which in a short period burst upon this island and very happily terminated in our signal deliverance from many of those religious and political evils which the spirit of Milton had through a long life most resolutely and conscientiously opposed  His treatise against the growth of popery which was published in was the last considerable performance that he gave to the world but publication in some shape seems to have contributed to his amusement as long as he existed In the same year he reprinted his smaller poems with the Tractate on Education and in the year following the last of his laborious life he published his Familiar Letters and a Declaration of the Poles in praise of their heroic sovereign John Sobieski translated from the Latin original A brief history of Moscovia which he appears to have compiled in the early parts of his life from various travellers who had visited that country was published a few years after his death and two of his compositions both perhaps intended for the  press have probably perished the first a System of Theology in Latin that seems to have been entrusted to his friend Cyriac Skinner the second an Answer to a scurrilous libel upon himself which his nephew supposes him to have suppressed from a just contempt of his reviler  Soon after his marriage in he had removed from Jewinstreet to a house in the Artillerywalk leading to Bunhillfields a spot that to his enthusiastic admirers may appear consecrated by his genius here he resided in that period of his days when he was peculiarly entitled to veneration here he probably finished no less than three of his most admirable works and here with a dissolution to easy that it was unperceived by the persons in his chamber he closed a life clouded indeed by uncommon and various calamities yet ennobled by the constant exercise of such rare endowments as render his name perhaps the very first in that radiant and comprehensive list of which England the most fertile of countries in the produce of mental power has reason to be proud  For some years he had suffered much from the gout and in July he found his constitution so broken by that distemper that he was willing to prepare for his departure from the world With this view he informed his brother Christopher who was then a bencher in the Inner Temple of the disposition he wished to make of his property "Brother said the invalid the portion due to me from Mr Powell my first wise's father I leave to the unkind children I had by her but I have received no part of it and my will and meaning is they shall have no other benefit of my  estate than the said portion and what I have besides done for them they having been very undutiful to me and all the residue of my estate I leave to the disposal of Elizabeth my loving wife" Such is the brief testament which Milton dictated to his brother about the th of July but which Christopher does not appear to have committed to paper till a few days after the decease of the testator who expired on Sunday night the th of November "All his learned and great friends in London says Toland not without a friendly concourse of the vulgar accompanied his body to the church of St Giles near Cripplegate where he lies buried in the chancel" This biographer who though he had the misfortune to think very differently from Milton on the great article of religion yet never fails to speak of him with affectionate respect indulged a pleasing expectation when he wrote his life in the close of the last century that national munificence would speedily raise a monument worthy of the poet to protect and to honour his remains To the discredit of our country she has failed to pay this decent tribute to the memory of a man from whose genius she has derived so much glory but an individual Mr Benson in the year placed a bust of the great author in Westminster Abbey an act of liberality that does him credit though Johnson and Pope have both satyrized the monumental inscription with a degree of cynical asperity such asperity appears unseasonable because all the ostentation so severely censured in Mr Benson amounts merely to his having said in the plainest manner that he raised the monument and to his having  added to his own name a common enumeration of the offices he possessed a circumstance in which candour might have discovered rather more modesty than prideAffluence appears particularly amiable when paying a voluntary tribute to neglected genius even in the grave nor is Benson the only individual of ample fortune who has endeared himself to the lovers of literature by generous endeavours to promote the celebrity of Milton Affectionate admirers of the poet will honour the memory of the late Mr Hollis in recollecting that he devoted much time and money to a similar pursuit and they will regret that he was unable to discover the Italian verses and the marble bust which he diligently sought for in Italy on a suggestion that such memorials of our poetic traveller had been carefully preserved in that country But from this brief digression on the recent admirers of Milton let us return to his family at the time of his decease  His will was contested by the daughters whose undutiful conduct it condemned being deficient in form it was set aside and letters of administration were granted to the widow who is said to have allotted an hundred pounds to each daughter a sum which being probably too little in their opinion and too much in her's would naturally produce reciprocal animosity and censure between the contending parties  It has been already observed that the recent discovery of this forgotten will and the allegations annexed to it throw considerable light on the domestic life of Milton and the more insight we can gain into his social and sequestered  hours the more we shall discover that he was not less entitled to private affection than to public esteem but let us contemplate his person before we proceed to a minuter examination of his mind and manners  So infatuated with rancour were the enemies of this illustrious man that they delineated his form as they represented his character with the utmost extravagance of malevolent falshood he was not only compared to that monster of deformity the eyeless Polypheme but described as a diminutive bloodless and shrivelled creature Expressions of this kind in which absurdity and malice are equally apparent induced him to expose the contemptible virulence of his revilers by a brief description of his own figure  Veniamus nunc ad mea crimina estne quod in vita aut moribus reprehendat Certe nihil Quid ergo Quod nemo nisi immanis ac barbarus fecisset formam mihi ac caecitatem objectat  Monstrum horrendum informe ingens cui lumen ademptum  Nunquam existimabam quidem sore ut de forma cum Cyclope certamen mihi esset

comperietur poteritis de reliquo eandem conjecturam facere Atque haec de forma mea vel coactus  He  represents himself as a man of moderate stature not particularly slender and so far endued with strength and spirit that as he always wore a sword he wanted not in his healthy season of life either skill or courage to use it having practised fencing with great assiduity he considered himself as a match for any antagonist however superior to him in muscular force his countenance he says was so far from being bloodless that when turned of forty he was generally allowed to have the appearance of being ten years younger even his eyes he adds though utterly deprived of sight did not betray their imperfection but on the contrary appeared as speckless and as lucid as if his powers of vision had been peculiarly acute  In this article alone  says Milton  and much against my will I am an hypocrite  Such is the interesting portrait which this great writer has left us of himself Those who had the happiness of knowing him personally speak in the highest terms even of his personal endowments and seem to have regarded him as a model of manly grace and dignity in his figure and deportment  "His harmonical and ingenuous soul" says Aubrey "dwelt in a beautiful and well proportioned body"  In toto nusquam corpore menda suit  His hair was a light brown his eyes dark grey and his complexion so fair that at college according to his own expression he was styled "The Lady" an appellation  which he could not relish but he consoled himself under absurd raillery on the delicacy of his person by recollecting that similar raillery had been lavished on those manly and eminent characters of the ancient world Demosthenes and Hortensius His general appearance approached not in any degree to effeminacy "His deportment" says Anthony Wood  was affable and his gait erect and manly bespeaking courage and undauntedness  Richardson who laboured with affectionate enthusiasm to acquire and communicate all possible information concerning the person and manners of Milton has left the two following sketches of his figure at an advanced period of life  "An ancient clergyman of Dorsetshire Dr Wright found John Milton in a small chamber hung with rusty green sitting in an elbow chair and dressed neatly in black pale but not cadaverous his hands and fingers gouty and with chalk stones"  "He used also to sit in a grey coarse cloth coat at the door of his house near Bunhillfields in warm sunny weather to enjoy the fresh air and so as well as in his room received the visits of people of distinguished parts as well as quality" It is probable that Milton in his youth was in some measure indebted to the engaging graces of his person for that early introduction into the politest society both in England and abroad which improved the natural sweetness of his character so visible in all his genuine portraits and led him to unite with profound erudition and with the sublimest talents an endearing and cheerful  delicacy of manners very rarely attained by men whose application to study is continual and intense  The enemies of Milton indeed and his late biographer I must reluctantly include under that description have laboured to fix upon him a fictitious and most unamiable character of austerity and harshness  What we know says Johnson of Milton's character in domestic relations is that he was severe and arbitrary His family consisted of women and there appears in his books something like a Turkish contempt of females as subordinate and inferior beings that his own daughters might not break the ranks he suffered them to be depressed by a mean and penurious education He thought woman made only for obedience and man for rebellion  This is assuredly the intemperate language of hatred and very far from being consonant to truth  As it was thought a sufficient defence of Sophocles when he was barbarously accused of mental imbecility by his unnatural children to read a portion of his recent dramatic works so I am confident the citation of a few verses from our English bard may be enough to clear him from a charge equally groundless and almost as ungenerous  No impartial reader of genuine sensibility will deem it possible that the poet could have entertained a Turkish contempt of females who has thus delineated woman  All higher knowledge in her presence falls  Degraded wisdom in discourse with her  Loses discountenanc'd and like folly shews  Authority and reason on her wait  As one intended first not after made  Occasionally and to consummate all  Greatness of mind and nobleness their seat  Build in her loveliest and create an awe  About her as a guard angelic plac'd  A description so complete could arise only from such exquisite feelings in the poet as insured to every deserving female his tenderest regard This argument might be still more enforced by a passage in the speech of Raphael but the preceding verses are I trust sufficient to counteract the uncandid attempt of the acrimonious biographer to prejudice the fairest part of the creation against a poet who has surpassed his peers in delineating their charms whose poetry a more enchanting mirror than the lake that he describes in Paradise represents their mental united to their personal graces and exhibits in perfection all the loveliness of woman  As to Milton's depressing his daughters by a mean and penurious education it is a calumny resting only on a report that he would not allow them the advantage of learning to write This is evidently false since Aubrey who was personally acquainted with the poet and who had probably consulted his widow in regard to many particulars of his life expressly affirms that his youngest daughter was his amanuensis a circumstance of which my friend Romney has happily availed himself to decorate the folio edition of this life with a production of his pencil The youngest  daughter of Milton had the most frequent opportunities of knowing his temper and she happens to be the only one of his children who has delivered a deliberate account of it but her account instead of confirming Johnson's idea of her father's domestic severity will appear to the candid reader to refute it completely "She spoke of him says Richardson with great tenderness she said he was delightful company the life of the conversation and that on account of a flow of subject and an unaffected cheerfulness and civility" It was this daughter who related the extraordinary circumstance that she and one of her sisters read to their father several languages which they did not understand it is remarkable that she did not speak of it as a hardship nor could it be thought an intolerable grievance by an affectionate child who thus assisted a blind parent in labouring for the maintenance of his family Such an employment however must have been irksome and the considerate father in finding that it was so "sent out his children according to the expression of his nephew to learn some curious and ingenious sorts of manufacture particularly embroideries in gold or silver" That he was no penurious parent is strongly proved by an expression that he made use of in speaking of his will when he declared that "he had made provision for his children in his lifetime and had spent the greatest part of his estate in providing for them" It is the more barbarous to arraign the poet for domestic cruelty because he appears to have suffered from the singular tenderness and generosity of his nature He had reason to lament that excess of indulgence with which  forgave and received again his disobedient and longalienated wife since their reunion not only disquieted his days but gave birth to daughters who seem to have inherited the perversity of their mother  The wisest and best men full oft beguil'd  With goodness principled not to reject  The penitent but ever to forgive  Are drawn to wear out miserable days  Intangled with a pois'nous bosomsnake  These pathetic lines in a speech of his Sampson Agonistes strike me as a forcible allusion to his own connubial infelicity If in his first marriage he was eminently unhappy his success in the two last turned the balance of fortune in his favour That his second wife deserved possessed and retained his affection is evident from his sonnet occasioned by her death of the care and kindness which he had long experienced from the partner of his declining life he spoke with tender gratitude to his brother in explaining his testamentary intention and we are probably indebted to the care and kindness which the aged poet experienced from this affectionate guardian for the happy accomplishment of his inestimable works A blind and desolate father must be utterly unequal to the management of disobedient daughters conspiring against him the anguish he endured from their filial ingratitude and the base deceptions with which they continually tormented him must have rendered even the strongest mind very unfit for poetical application The  which he concluded by the advice and the aid of his friend Dr Paget seems to have been his only resource against a most exasperating and calamitous species of domestic disquietude it appears therefore not unreasonable to regard those immortal poems which recovered tranquillity enabled him to produce as the fruits of that marriage As matrimony has perhaps annihilated many a literary design let it be remembered to its honour that it probably gave birth to the brightest offspring of literature  The two eldest daughters of Milton appear to me utterly unworthy of their father but those who adopt the dark prejudices of Johnson and believe with him that the great poet was an austere domestic tyrant will find in their idea of the father an apology for his children whose destiny in the world I shall immediately mention that I may have occasion to speak of them no more Anne the eldest who with a deformed person had a pleasing face married an architect and died with her first infant in childbed Mary the second and apparently the most deficient in affection to her father died unmarried Deborah who was the favourite of Milton and who long after his decease discovered on a casual sight of his genuine portrait very affecting emotions of filial tenderness and enthusiasm even Deborah deserted him without his knowledge not in consequence of his paternal severity of which she was very far from complaining but as Richardson intimates from a disgust she had conceived against her motherinlaw On quitting the house of her father she went to Ireland with a lady and afterwards became the wife of Mr Clarke a weaver in  Spitalfields As her family was numerous and her circumstances not affluent the liberal Addison made her a present from his regard to the memory of her father and intended to procure her some decent establishment but died before he could accomplish his generous design From Queen Caroline she received fifty guineas a donation as ill proportioned to the rank of the donor as to the mental dignity of the great genius whose indigent daughter was the object of this unprincely munificence Mrs Clarke had ten children but none of them appear to have attracted public regard till Dr Birch and Dr Newton two benevolent and respectable biographers of the poet discovered his granddaughter Mrs Elizabeth Foster keeping a little chandler'sshop in the city poor aged and infirm they publicly spoke of her condition Johnson was then writing as the coadjutor of Lauder in his attempt to sink the glory of Milton but as the critic's charity was still greater than his spleen he seized the occasion of recommending under Lauder's name this necessitous descendant of the great poet to the beneficence of his country Comus was represented for her benefit in the year and Johnson to his honour contributed a prologue on the occasion in which noble sentiments are nobly expressed  The poor granddaughter of Milton gained but one hundred and thirty pounds by this public benefaction this sum however small as it was afforded peculiar comfort to her declining age by enabling her to retire to Islington with her husband she had seven children who died before her and by her own death it is probable that the line of  the poet became extinct Let us hasten from this painful survey of his progeny to the more enlivening contemplation of his rare mental endowments The most diligent researches into all that can elucidate the real temper of Milton only confirm the opinion that his native characteristics were mildness and magnanimity In controversy his mind was undoubtedly overheated and passages may be quoted from his prose works that are certainly neither mild nor magnanimous but if his controversial asperity is compared with the outrageous insolence of his opponents even that asperity will appear moderation in social intercourse he is represented as peculiarly courteous and engaging When the celebrity of his Latin work made him esteemed abroad many enquiries were made concerning his private character among his familiar acquaintance and the result of such enquiry was that mildness and affability were his distinguishing qualities "Virum esse miti comique ingenio aiunt" says the celebrate Heinsius in a letter that he wrote concerning Milton in the year to Gronovius Another eminent foreigner represents him in the same pleasing light and from the best information Vossius who was at that time in Sweden and who mentions the praise which his royal patroness Christina bestowed on Milton's recent defence of the English people informs his friend Heinsius that he had obtained a very particular account of the author from a relation of his own the learned Junius who wrote the elaborate and interesting history of ancient painting resided in England and particularly cultivated the intimacy of Milton  Indeed when we reflect on the poet's uncommon tenderness towards his parents and all the advantages of his early life both at home and abroad we have every reason to believe that his manners were singularly pleasing He was fond of refined female society and appears to have been very fortunate in two female friends of distinction the Lady Margaret Ley whose society consoled him when he was mortified by the desertion of his first wife and the no less accomplished Lady Ranelagh who had placed her son under his care and who probably assisted him when he was a widower and blind with friendly directions for the management of his female infants A passage in one of his letters to her son suggests this idea for he condoles with his young correspondent then at the University on the loss they would both sustain by the long absence of his most excellent mother passing at that time into Ireland "her departure must grieve us both" says Milton "for to me also she supplied the place of every friend  Nam et mihi omnium necessitudinum loco fuit  " an expression full of tenderness and regret highly honourable to the lady and a pleasing memorial of that sensibility and gratitude which I am persuaded we should have seen most eminent in the character of Milton if his English letters had been fortunately preserved particularly his letters to this interesting lady whose merits are commemorated in an eloquent sermon preached by bishop Burnet on the death of her brother that mild and accomplished model of virtue and of learning Robert Boyle Lady Ranelagh must have been one of the  exemplary and engaging characters that ever existed since we find she was the darling sister of this illustrious philosopher and the favourite friend of a poet still more illustrious Four of Milton's Latin letters are addressed to her son and they blend with moral precepts to the young student respectful and affectionate praise of his mother  In the quarto edition of Boyle there are a few letters from his favourite sister Lady Ranelagh one very interesting in which she speaks of the poet Waller but she does not mention the name of Milton in the whole collection Her son the first and last Earl of Ranelagh who was in his childhood a disciple of the great poet proved a man of talents business and pleasure    In the Latin correspondence of Milton we have some vestiges of his sentiments concerning the authors of antiquity and it is remarkable that in a deliberate opinion on the merits of Sallust  De Sallustio quod scribis dicam libere quoniam ita visplane ut dicam quod sentio Sallustium cuivis Latino historico me quidem anteferre quae etiam constans fere

richness purity and lustre to the fancy the second to invigorate the understanding and inspire the fervid energy of public virtue It is a very just remark of Lord Monboddo that even the poetical speeches in Paradise Lost derive their consummate propriety and eloquence from the fond and enlightened attention with which the poet had studied the most perfect orator of Athens the studies of Milton however were very extensive he appears to have been familiar not only with all the best authors of antiquity but with those of every refined language in Europe Italian French Spanish and Portugueze Great erudition has been often supposed to operate as an incumbrance on the finer faculties of the mind but let us observe to its credit the sublimest of poets was also the most learned of Italian literature he was particularly fond as we may collect from one of his letters to a professor of that language and from the ease and spirit of his Italian verses To the honour of modern Italy it may be said that she had a considerable share in forming the genius of Milton In Tasso her brightest ornament he found a character highly worthy of his affectionate emulation both as a poet and as a man this accomplished personage had indeed ended his illustrious and troubled life several years before Milton visited his country but he was yet living in the memory of his ardent friend Manso and through the medium of Manso's  conversation his various excellencies made I am persuaded a forcible and permanent impression on the heart and fancy of our youthful countryman It was hardly the example of Trissino as Johnson supposes that tempted Milton to his bold experiment of blank verse for Trissino's epic poem is a very heavy performance and had sunk into such oblivion in Italy that the literary friend and biographer of Tasso considers that greater poet as the first person who enriched the Italian language with valuable blank verse "our early works of that kind" says Manso "are translations from the Latin and those not successful" The poem in blank verse for which this amiable biographer applauds his friend is an extensive work in seven books on the Seven Days of the Creation a subject that has engaged the poets of many countries The performance of Tasso was begun at the house of his friend Manso and at the suggestion of a lady the accomplished mother of the Marquis As this poem is formed from the Bible and full of religious enthusiasm it probably influenced the English visiter of Manso in his choice of blank verse Tasso was a voluminous author and we have reason to believe that Milton was familiar with all his compositions as the exquisite eulogy on connubial affection in the Paradise Lost is founded on a prose composition in favour of marriage addressed by the Italian poet to one of his relations  Tasso begins this interesting discourse by informing his kinsman Ercole that he first heard the news of his having taken a wife and then was surprised by reading a composition of his in which he inveighs not only against the ladies but against matrimony The poet with great politeness and spirit assumes the defence of both and in the close of a learned and eloquent panegyric indulges his heart and fancy in a very animated and beautiful address to wedded love which Milton has copied with his usual dignity and sweetness of expression  but Milton who was perhaps of all authors the  addicted to imitation rarely imitates even Tasso in composition in life indeed he copied him more closely and to his great poetical compeer of Italy he discovers a very striking resemblance in application to study in temperance of diet in purity of morals and in fervency of devotion The Marquis of Villa in closing his life of Tasso has enumerated all the particular virtues by which he was distinguished these were all equally conspicuous in Milton and we may truly say of him what Manso says of the great Italian poet that the preference of virtue to every other consideration was the predominant passion of his life  Enthusiasm was the characteristic of his mind in politics it made him sometimes too generously credulous and sometimes too rigorously decisive but in poetry it exalted him to such a degree of excellence as no man has hitherto surpassed nor is it probable that in this province he will ever be excelled for although in all the arts there are undoubtedly points of perfection much higher than any mortal has yet attained still it requires such a coincidence of so many advantages depending on the influence both of nature and of destiny to raise a great artist of any kind that the world has but little reason to expect productions of poetical genius superior to the Paradise Lost There was a bold yet refined originality of conception which characterised the mental powers of Milton and give him the highest claim to distinction we are not only indebted to him for having extended and ennobled the province of epic poetry but he has another title to our regard as the founder of that recent and enchanting English art which has embellished  our country and to speak the glowing language of a living bard very eloquent in its praise  Made Albion smile  One ample theatre of sylvan grace  The elegant historian of modern gardening Lord Orford and the two accomplished poets who have celebrated its charms both in France and England De Lille and Mason have with great justice and felicity of expression paid their homage to Milton as the beneficent genius who bestowed upon the world this youngest and most lovely of the arts As a contrast to the Miltonic garden I may point out to the notice of the reader what has escaped I think all the learned writers on this engaging subject the garden of the imperious Duke of Alva described in a poem of the celebrated Lope de Vega The sublime vision of Eden as Lord Orford truly calls it proves indeed as the same writer observes how little the poet suffered from the loss of sight The native disposition of Milton and his personal infirmity conspired to make contemplation his chief business and chief enjoyment few poets have devoted so large a portion of their time to intense and regular study yet he often made a pause of some months in the progress of his great work if we may confide in the circumstantial narrative of his nephew "I had the perusal of it from the very beginning" says Philips "for some years as I went from time to time to visit him in parcels of ten twenty or thirty verses at a time which being written by whatever hand came next  might possibly want correction as to the orthography and pointing Having as the summer came on not been shewed any for a considerable while and desiring the reason thereof was answered that his vein never happily flowed but from the autumual equinox to the vernal"  Johnson takes occasion from this anecdote to treat the sensations of Milton with sarcastic severity and to deride him for submitting to the influence of the seasons he lavishes ridicule not less acrimonious on the great poet for having yielded to a fashionable dread of evils still more fantastic "There prevailed in his time says the critic an opinion that the world was in its decay and that we have had the misfortune to be born in the decrepitude of nature" Johnson exposes with great felicity of expression this absurd idea of which his own frame of body and mind was a complete refutation but instead of deriding the great poet for harbouring so weak a conceit he might have recollected that Milton himself has spurned this chimera of timid imagination in very spirited Latin verse written in his twentieth year and expressly against the folly of supposing nature impaired  Ergone marcescet sulcantibus obsita rugis  Naturae facies et rerum publica mater  Omniparum contracta uterum sterilescet ab aevo  Et se fassa senem male certis passibus ibit  Sidereum tremebunda caput  How shall the face of nature then be plough'd  Into deep wrinkles and shall years at last  On the great parent fix a steril curse  Shall even she confess old age and halt  And palsysmitten shake her starry brows  COWPER  The spirit of the poet was in truth little formed for yielding to any weaknesses of fancy that could impede mental exertion and we may consider it as one of the striking peculiarities of his character that with an imagination so excursive he possessed a mind so industrious  His studious habits are thus described by his acquaintance Aubrey and others who collected their account from his widowHe rose at four in the summer at five in the winter and regularly began the day by hearing a chapter in the Hebrew Bible it was read to him by a man who after this duty left him to meditation of some hours and returning at seven either read or wrote for him till twelve he then allowed himself an hour for exercise which was usually walking and when he grew blind the occasional resource of a swing after an early and temperate dinner he commonly allotted some time to music his favourite amusement and his own musical talents happily furnished him with a pleasing relaxation from his severer pursuits he was able to vary his instrument as he played both on the bass viol and the organ with the advantage of an agreeable voice which his father had probably taught him to cultivate in his youth This regular custom of the great  to indulge himself in musical relaxation after food has been recently praised as favourable to mental exertion in producing all the good effects of sleep with none of its disadvantages by an illustrious scholar who like Milton unites the passion and the talent of poetry to habits of intense and diversified application Sir William Jones in the third volume of Asiatic Researches has recommended from his own experience this practice of Milton who from music returned to study at eight he took a light supper and at nine retired to bed  If such extreme regularity could be preserved at any period it must have been in the closing years of his life While he was in office his time was undoubtedly much engaged not only by official attendance but by his intercourse with learned foreigners as the parliament allowed him a weekly table for their reception The Latin compositions of Milton had rendered him on the continent an object of idolatry "and strangers says Wood who was far from being partial to his illustrious contemporary visited the house where he was born" Even in his latter days when he is supposed to have been neglected by his countrymen intelligent foreigners were solicitous to converse with him as an object of their curiosity and veneration they regarded him and very justly as the prime wonder of England for he was in truth a person so extraordinary that it may be questioned if any age or nation has produced his parallel Is there in the records of literature an author to be found who after gaining such extensive celebrity as a political disputant cast off the mortal  of a polemic and arose in the purest splendor of poetical immortality  Biographers are frequently accused of being influenced by affection for their subject to a certain degree it is right that they should be so for what is biography in its fairest point of view a tribute paid by justice and esteem to genius and to virtue and never is this tribute more pleasing or more profitable to mankind than when it is liberally paid with all the fervor and all the fidelity of friendship the chief delight and the chief utility that arises from this attractive branch of literature consists in the affectionate interest which it displays and communicates in favour of the talents and probity that it aspires to celebrate hence the most engaging pieces of biography are those that have been written by relations of the deceased This remark is exemplified in the life of Agricola by Tacitus and in that of Racine the dramatic poet written by his son who was also a poet and addressed to his grandson  It has been the lot of Milton to have his life frequently described and recently by a very powerful author who had he loved the character he engaged to delineate might perhaps have satisfied the admirers of the poet and closed the list of his numerous biographers But the very wonderful mind of Johnson was so embittered by prejudice that in delineating a character confessedly preeminent in eminent accomplishments in genius and in piety he perpetually endeavours to represent him as unamiable and instead of attributing any mistaken opinions that he might entertain to such sources as charity and reason conspire to  suggest imputes them to supposed vices in his mind most foreign to his nature and the very worst that an enemy could imagine  In the course of this narrative I have considered it as a duty incumbent upon me to notice and counteract as they occurred many important strokes of the hostility which I am now lamenting these become still more remarkable in that portion of the biographer's labour to which I am at length arrived it is in diffecting the mind of Milton if I may use such an expression that Johnson indulges the injurious intemperance of his hatred  It is to be suspected he says that his predominant desire was to destroy rather than establish and that he felt not so much the love of liberty as repugnance to authority  Such a suspicion may indeed be harboured by political rancour but it must be in direct opposition to justice and truth for of all men who have written or acted in the service of liberty there is no individual who has proved more completely both by his language and his life that he made a perfect distinction between liberty and licentiousness No human spirit could be more sincerely a lover of just and beneficent authority for no man delighted more in peace and order no man has written more eloquently in their praise or given sublimer proofs of his own personal attachment to them by the regulation of his own orderly and peaceful studies If he hated power as Johnson asserts in every established form he hated not its salutary influence but its pernicious exertions Vehement as he occasionally was against kings and prelates he spoke of the sectaries with equal indignation  and abhorrence when they also became the agents of persecution and as he had fully seen and has forcibly exposed the gross failings of republican reformers had his life been extended long enough to witness the Revolution which he might have beheld without suffering the decrepitude or imbecility of extreme old age he would probably have exulted as warmly as the staunchest friend of our present constitution can exult in that temperate and happy reformation of monarchical enormities  Johnson also intimates that he was a shallow politician who supposed money to be the chief good though with singular inconsistency he at the same time confesses "that fortune seems not to have had much of his care"  Money in fact had so little influence over the elevated mind of Milton that from his want of attention to it he sustained such losses as according to his nephew's expression "might have ruined a man less temperate than he was" Two thousand pounds he is said to have lost by entrusting it to government and as much in a private loan without sufficient security  "Towards the latter part of his time" says one of his early biographers "he contracted his library both because the heirs he left could not make a right use of it and that he thought he might fell it more to their advantage than they could be able to do themselves His enemies reported that poverty constrained him thus to part with his books and were this true it would be a great disgrace not to him for persons of the highest merits have been often reduced to that condition but to any country that should have no more  to probity or learning This story however is so false that he died worth fifteen hundred pounds besides all his goods"  Such are the remarks of Toland on the pecuniary circumstances of the poet they shew with becoming spirit that he was not reduced by absolute indigence to the sale of his library yet every reader whose literary feelings are acute must regret that the old age of Milton was not guarded and enlivened by such affluence as might have saved him from a measure in which those who have a passion for books must suppose him to have suffered some degree of mortification  The necessities into which many deserving men of letters have fallen towards the close of life and in various countries may be regarded as an universal disgrace to civilized society which the improving refinement and liberality of mankind ought effectually to remove Literature which is so eminently beneficial to a nation is frequently ruinous to worthy individuals most fervently attached to it and it should be regarded as a duty therefore by every polished people to provide a public fund which might afford a becoming competence to the advanced life of every illustrious scholar whose public labours entitle him to that honourable distinction Such meritorious veterans in literature as Milton and his late aged biographer should have been preserved in their declining days from every shadow of indigence by the public gratitude of the nation to whom they had devoted their intellectual service What friend to letters and to genius could fail to wish affluent comfort to the closing  life of such authors however he might condemn the excesses of republican severity in the one or those of servile and censorial bigotry in the other  There can hardly be any contemplation more painful than to dwell on the virulent excesses of eminent and good men yet the utility of such contemplation may be equal to its pain What mildness and candour should it not instil ordinary into mortals to observe that even genius and virtue weaken their title to respect in proportion as they recede from that evangelical charity which should influence every man in his judgment of another  The strength and the acuteness of sensation which partly constitute genius have a great tendency to produce virulence if the mind is not perpetually on its guard against that subtle insinuating and corrosive passion hatred against all whose opinions are opposite to our own Johnson professed in one of his letters to love a good hater and in the Latin correspondence of Milton there are words that imply a similarity of sentiment they both thought there might be a sanctified bitterness to use an expression of Milton towards political and religious opponents yet surely these two devout men were both wrong and both in some degree unchristian in this principle To what singular iniquities of judgment such a principle may lead we might perhaps have had a most striking and a double proof had it been possible for these two energetic writers to exhibit alternately a portrait of each other Milton adorned with every graceful endowment highly and holily accomplished as he was appears in the dark colouring of Johnson a most unamiable  being but could he revisit earth in his mortal character with a wish to retaliate what a picture might be drawn by that sublime and offended genius of the great moralist who has treated him with such excess of asperity The passions are powerful colourists and marvellous adepts in the art of exaggeration but the portraits executed by love famous as he is for overcharging them are infinitely more faithful to nature than gloomy sketches from the heavy hand of hatred a passion not to be trusted or indulged even in minds of the highest purity or power since hatred though it may enter the field of contest under the banner of justice yet generally becomes so blind and outrageous from the heat of contention as to execute in the name of virtue the worst purposes of vice Hence arises that species of calumny the most to be regretted the calumny lavished by men of talents and worth on their equals or superiors whom they have rashly and blindly hated for a difference of opinion To such hatred the fervid and opposite characters who gave rise to this observation were both more inclined perhaps by nature and by habit than christianity can allow The freedom of these remarks on two very great and equally devout though different writers may possibly offend the partizans of both in that case my consolation will be that I have endeavoured to speak of them with that temperate though undaunted sincerity which may satisfy the spirit of each in a purer state of existence There is one characteristic in Milton which ought to be considered as the chief source of his happiness and his fame I mean his early and perpetual attachment to religion It must gratify every  christian to reflect that the man of our country most eminent for energy of mind for intenseness of application and for frankness and intrepidity in asserting whatever he believed to be the cause of truth was so confirmedly devoted to christianity that he seems to have made the Bible not only the rule of his conduct but the prime director of his genius His poetry flowed from the scripture as if his unparalleled poetical powers had been expressly given him by Heaven for the purpose of imparting to religion such lustre as the most splendid of human faculties could bestow As in the Paradise Lost he seems to emulate the sublimity of Moses and the prophets it appears to have been his wish in the Paradise Regained to copy the sweetness and simplicity of the milder evangelists If the futile remarks that were made upon the latter work on its first appearance excited the spleen of the great author he would probably have felt still more indignant could he have seen the comment of Warburton That disgusting writer whose critical dictates form a fantastic medley of arrogance acuteness and absurdity has asserted that the plan of Paradise Regained is very unhappy and that nothing was easier than to have invented a good one  Much idle censure seems to have been thrown on more than one of Milton's poetical works from want of due attention to the chief aim of the poetif we fairly consider it in regard to Paradise Regained the aim I allude to as it probably occasioned will completely justify the plan which the presumptuous critic has so superciliously condemned Milton had already executed one extensive divine poem  peculiarly distinguished by richness and sublimity of description in framing a second he would naturally wish to vary its effect to make it rich in moral sentiment and sublime in its mode of unfolding the highest wisdom that man can learn for this purpose it was necessary to keep all the ornamental parts of the poem in due subordination to the preceptive This delicate and difficult point is accomplished with such felicity they are blended together with such exquisite harmony and mutual aid that instead of arraigning the plan we might rather doubt if any possible change could improve it assuredly there is no poem of epic form where the sublimest moral instruction is so forcibly and abundantly united to poetical delight the splendour of the poet does not blaze indeed so intensely as in his larger production here he resembles the Apollo of Ovid softening his glory in speaking to his son and avoiding to dazzle the fancy that he may descend into the heart His dignity is not impaired by his tenderness The Paradise Regained is a poem that deserves to be particularly recommended to ardent and ingenuous youth as it is admirably calculated to inspire that spirit of selfcommand which is as Milton esteemed it the truest heroism and the triumph of christianity  It is not my intention to enter into a critical analysis of the beauties and the blemishes that are visible in the poetry of Milton not only because Addison and Johnson have both written admirably on his greatest work but because my most excellent friend the poet whose spirit I esteem most congenial to that of Milton is engaged in such illustration of his honoured predecessor I shall therefore confine  myself to a single essay detached from this narrative under the title of "Conjectures on the Origin of the Paradise Lost"  I must not however omit to speak here as I have engaged to do of the character bestowed by Johnson on the principal performance of the poet the greatest part of that character is perhaps the most splendid tribute that was ever paid by one powerful mind to another Aristotle Longinus and Quintilian have not spoken of their favourite Homer with more magnificence of praise yet the character taken altogether is a golden image that has lower parts of iron and of clay The critic seems to prepare a diadem of the richest jewels he places them most liberally on the head of the poet but in the moment of adjusting his radiant gift he breathes upon it such a vapour of spleen as almost annihilates its lustre  After displaying in the noblest manner many of the peculiar excellencies in the poem he says "its perusal is a duty rather than a pleasure we read Milton for instruction retire harassed and overburthened and look elsewhere for recreation we desert our master and seek for companions"  Injurious as these remarks are to the poet let us ascribe them not to the virulence of intended detraction but to the want of poetical sensibility in the critic a want that may be sufficiently proved by comparing this account of the effect produced by Paradise Lost on his own feelings with its effect on a spirit truly poetical That enchanting poem The Task very happily furnishes such an illustration it is  thus that a mind attuned by nature to poetry describes the effect in question as produced even in childhood  Then Milton had indeed a poet's charms  New to my taste his Paradise surpassed  The strugg'ling efforts of my boyish tongue  To speak its excellence I danc'd for joy  But the little delight that Johnson confesses himself to have taken in the poetry of Milton was rather his misfortune than his fault it merits pity more than reproach as it partly arose from constitutional infelicity and the very wide difference between the native turn of his mind and that of the poet never were two spirits less congenial or two christian scholars who differed more completely in their sentiments of poetry politics and religion In temperament as well as in opinions they were the reverse of each other the one was sanguine to excess the other melancholy in the extreme Milton  Might sit in the centre and enjoy bright day  but Johnson  Benighted walk'd under the midday sun  Himself was his own dungeon  Such was the great contrast between these two extraordinary men that although they were both equally sincere in their attachment to christianity and both distinguished by  noble intellectual exertions in the service of mankind the critic was naturally disqualified from being a fair and a perfect judge of the poet My regard for a departed and meritorious writer of great powers but constitutionally unhappy is such that I would rather ascribe to any cause than to mere envious malignity his outrages against the poetical glory of Milton which from the force and celebrity of the very admirable but too austere work that contains them it becomes the duty of a more recent biographer to expose  For example when Johnson says that Milton "wrote no language but formed a Babylonish dialect harsh and barbarous" though it would be difficult to pronounce a critical censure more bitter or more injurious we may impute it not to a malevolent desire of depreciating the poet but to a natural want of ear for that harmony which the critic condemns as discord On this article the most harmonious of our bards has been very happily vindicated by men of science and taste Dr Foster and Lord Monboddo have shewn Milton to be one of the most consummate artificers of language that ever gave either energy or grace to words and Mr Loft in the preface to his recent edition of Paradise Lost describes the majestic flow of his numbers with such truth and eloquence as render ample justice to the insulted dignity of the poet  The insult gross as it may be thought loses much of its force when we recollect the inconsistency of the critic who though in his latter work he condemns the language of Milton as harsh and barbarous had before observed with  more truth in the Rambler that the poet "excelled as much in the lower as in the higher parts of his art and that his skill in harmony was not less than his invention or his learning" but the praise as well as the censure of Johnson on this article could not be the result of perfect perception for the monotony of his own blank verse and some of his remarks in the Rambler on particular lines of Milton are striking proofs that although he was a melodious writer himself in the common measures of rhyme and in dignified prose yet he never entered with perfect intelligence and feeling into the musical graces of Miltonic composition he was indeed as far from enjoying the poet's ear for the varied modulations and extensive compass of metrical harmony as he was from possessing the mild elegance of his manners or the cheerful elevation of his mind  There is a striking resemblance between the poetical and the moral character of Milton they were both the result of the finest dispositions for the attainment of excellence that nature could bestow and of all the advantages that ardour and perseverance in study and discipline could add in a long course of years to the beneficent prodigality of nature even in infancy he discovered a passion for glory in youth he was attached to temperance and arriving at manhood he formed the magnanimous design of building a lofty name upon the most solid and secure foundation  "He all his study bent  To worship God aright and know his works  Not hid nor those things last that might preserve  Freedom and peace to men  In a noble consciousness of his powers and intentions he was not afraid to give in his early life a most singular promise to his country of producing such future works as might redound to her glory and though such personal calamities fell upon him as might fairly have absolved him from that engagement yet never was any promise more magnificently fulfilled Seneca has considered a man of resolution struggling with adversity as a spectacle worthy of God our resolute countryman not only struggled with adversity but under a peculiar load of complicated calamities he accomplished those works that are justly reckoned among the noblest offspring of human genius In this point of view with what pathetic grandeur is the poet invested In contemplating the variety of his sufferings and his various mental atchievements we may declare without any extravagance of praise that although sublimity is the predominant characteristic of Milton's poem his own personal character is still more sublime  His majestic preeminence is nobly described in the following verses of Akenside a poet who bore some affinity to Milton in the ardour of his mind whose sentiments are always noble though not always accompanied by a graceful felicity of expression  Mark how the dread Pantheon stands  Amid the domes of modern hands  Amid the toys of idle state  How simply how severely great  Then turn and while each western clime  Presents her tuneful sons to time  So mark thou MILTON's name  And add thus differs from the throng  The spirit which inform'd thy aweful song  Which bade thy potent voice protect thy country's fame  The powers of Milton indeed are so irresistible that even those whom the blindness of prejudice has rendered his enemies are constrained to regard him as an object of admiration In this article posterity to whom he made a very interesting appeal has done him ample justice still he is more admired than beloved yet in granting him only admiration we ungenerously withhold the richest half of that posthumous reward for which he laboured so fervently we may be confident that he rather wished to excite the affection than the applause of mankind and assuredly he has the noblest title to both the title of having exerted superlative genius and literary ambition under the constant influence of religious philanthropy In proportion as our country has advanced in purity of taste she has applauded the poet and in proportion as she advances in liberality of sentiment she will love the man but love in this aspect is more volatile than admiration and a beneficent genius may be easily deprived of it by the detraction of an enemy or  the mistake of a friend Milton has suffered not a little from both and indeed if one singular mistake of his friends should prevail he could hardly become an object of general affection What votary of the Muses could love a poet however excellent in that capacity who represented it as a crime in a captive monarch to have made the poetry of Shakespeare the companion of his solitude Credulity has imagined that Milton was such a barbarous Goth Nor is this the suggestion of his enemies even Warton the liberal defender of his poetical reputation and several living writers of eminence have lavished their censures on Milton from a too hasty belief that puritanical prejudices had hurried him into this rancorous absurdity  Their censures are all founded on a mistake but the merit of correcting it belongs not to me Mr Waldron the sensible and modest editor of a miscellany entitled The Literary Museum in a note to Roscius Anglicanus has in a very liberal manner collected and refuted the charges against Milton on this point and abundantly proved that instead of censuring the unfortunate Charles for amusing himself with Shakespeare he only censured him for imitating the religious hypocrisy of Richard the Third so closely as to utter the very sentiments that are assigned to Richard in the page of the dramatic poet  Milton undoubtedly thought what an ardent political writer of the present age has not scrupled to assert that "Charles the First lived and died an hypocrite" These two acute judges of mankind were I believe mistaken in this idea it seems more probable that this unfortunate  prince was flattered into a persuasion that he was really the meritorious martyr his adherents endeavoured to represent him But whatsoever his genuine character might be the severe sentiments which Milton entertained of the king and the delusive hopes that he cherished of the protector had equally their source in the virtuous ardour of his own spirit The consciousness of his integrity when time had fully unveiled to him some illusions gave that tranquillity and vigour to his declining days which enabled him to produce his astonishing poems not more astonishing for their intrinsic merit than for the period of their production so that his poetry in this point of view may be regarded both as the offspring and the witness of his virtue The world had never been enriched with his two poems on Paradise if their great author when he was according to his own true and pathetic description  In darkness and with dangers compass'd round  had not in some little degree resembled the hero of his latter poem and like that hallowed personage whom he delineates so divinely amid the darkness and the fiends of the desert  Sat unappall'd in calm and sinless peace  Yet to such misrepresentations has the life and the poetry of Milton been exposed that both have been considered as too austere to be amiable though assuredly both in the one  and the other the most engaging qualities are admirably united to the most awefulthe graceful and the tender to the grand and the sublime  The attractions of his muse have triumphed over obloquy and in the estimation of the world she is justly thought to resemble the enchanting Eve of the poet  Adorn'd  With what all earth or heav'n could bestow  To make her amiable  But equal justice has not hitherto been rendered to the personal virtues of the author it has therefore been my chief aim in a delineation of his life to make Milton rather more beloved than more admired and I may the more reasonably hope to succeed in that idea because though I have never been attached to his political opinions yet in proportion to my researches into his character as a man he has advanced in my esteem and my affection  I lament that the necessity of investigating many misrepresentations and of correcting much asperity against him has frequently obliged me to speak rather in the tone of an advocate than of a common biographer but I may say in the words of the great Roman author pleading the cause of a poet infinitely less entitled to love and admiration Hunc ego non diligam non admirer non omni ratione defendendum putem Atque sic a summis hominibus cruditissimisque accepimus caeterarum rerum studia et doctrina et praeceptis et arte constare poetam natura ipsa valere et mentis  viribus excitari et quasi divino quodam spiritu afflariif poetical powers may ever deserve to be regarded as heavenly inspiration such undoubtedly were those of Milton and the use to which he applied them was worthy of the fountain whence they flowed He is preeminent in that class of poets very happily described in the two following verses by the amiable lord Falkland  Who while of heav'n the glories they recite  Find it within and feel the joys they write  It is by the epic compositions of Milton alone that England may esteem herself as a rival to antiquity in the highest province of literature and it appears therefore just that the memory of the man to whom she is indebted for the purest the most extensive and permanent glory should for ever excite her affectionate veneration  CONJECTURES ON THE ORIGIN OF THE  PARADISE LOST  CONJECTURES c  CONJECTURES FANCIES BUILT ON NOTHING FIRM▪  MILTON  TO write an Epic Poem was the prime object of MILTON's ambition at an early period of life a passionate attachment to his country made him first think of celebrating its ancient heroes but in the long interval between the dawn of such a project in his thoughts and the commencement of his work a new train of images got possession of his fancy Arthur yielded to Adam and England to Paradise  To consider what various causes might conspire to produce this revolution in the ideas of the great poet may be a pleasing speculation if it is pursued with due respect to the noble mind that it aspires to examine  An investigation of a similar nature was undertaken some years ago upon very different principles when a singular attempt was made to annihilate the poetical glory of Milton by proving him a plagiary This attempt was so extraordinary in its nature and in its end so honourable  to the poet and his country that a brief account of it should I think be annexed to the Life of Milton whose admirers may say on that occasion to the slanderers of genius  Discite justitiam moniti non temnere divos  I shall give therefore a sketch of the literary transactions to which I allude as an introduction to those conjectures that a long and affectionate attachment to Milton has led me to form concerning the origin of his greatest work  In William Lauder an unfortunate adventurer whom a furious temper considerable learning and greater indigence converted into an audacious impostor attacked the originality of the chief English poet Having asserted in a periodical miscellany that Milton had borrowed all his ideas from the juvenile work of Grotius or from other less known writers of Latin verse and finding the novelty of his charge attract the attention of the public he endeavoured to enforce it in a pamphlet intitled  An Essay on Milton's Use and Imitation of the Moderns  printed in and addressed to the two universities of Oxford and Cambridge In the close of this essay he scrupled not to say of Milton  His industrious concealment of his helps his peremptory disclaiming all manner of assistance is highly ungenerous nay criminal to the last degree and absolutely unworthy of any man of common probity and  honour By this mean practice indeed he has acquired the title of the British Homer nay has been preferred to Homer and Virgil both and consequently to every other poet of every age and nation Cowley Waller Denham Dryden Prior Pope in comparison with Milton have borne no greater proportion than that of dwarfs to a giant who now he is reduced to his true standard appears mortal and uninspired and in ability little superior to the poets abovementioned but in honesty and open dealing the best quality of the human mind not inferior perhaps to the most unlicensed plagiary that ever wrote  In a publication containing  such language  Lauder was able to engage the great critic and moralist Samuel Johnson as his confederate for the preface and postscript to the Essay from which the preceding paragraph is cited are confessedly the composition of that elaborate and nervous writer  This confederacy unbecoming as it may at first appear will on candid reflection seem rather a credit than a disgrace to Johnson for we certainly ought to believe that the primary motive which prompted him to the assistance of Lauder was that true and noble compassion for indigence which made him through life so generously willing to afford all the aid in his power to literary mendicants but in rendering justice to that laudable charity which he constantly exercised to the necessitous we cannot fail to observe that his malevolent  prejudices against Milton were equally visible on this signal occasion Had he not been under the influence of such prejudice could his strong understanding have failed to point out to his associate what a liberal monitor very justly observed to Lauder in convicting him of fraud and falshood that allowing his facts to have been true his inference from them was unfair Lauder with an unexampled audacity of imposture had corrupted the text of the poets whom he produced as evidence against Milton by interpolating several verses which he had taken from a neglected Latin translation of the Paradise Lost Expecting probably to escape both discovery and suspicion by the daring novelty of his deception and the mental dignity of his patron and coadjutor he exulted in the idea of blasting the laurels of Milton but those laurels were proof indeed against the furious and repeated flashes of malevolence and hostility More than one defence of the injured poet appeared the first I believe was a pamphlet by Mr Richardson of Clare Hall printed in and entitled Zoilomastix or a Vindication of Milton consisting of letters inserted in the miscellany where the charge of Lauder had made its first appearance but the complete overthrow of that impostor was accomplished by Dr Douglas the present Bishop of Salisbury who published in a letter addressed to Lord Bath with the title of "Milton vindicated from the Charge of Plagiarism" a performance that in many points of view may be regarded as a real honour to literature  it unites what we find very rarely united in literary contention great modesty with great fervour and magnanimous moderation with the severity of vindictive justice The author speaks with amiable liberality of Mr Bowle in saying  that gentleman had first collected materials for an answer to Lauder  and  has the justest claim to the honour of being the original detector of this ungenerous critic  The writer of this valuable pamphlet gave also an admonition to Johnson which breathes the manly spirit of intelligence of justice and of candour  It is to be hoped he said nay it is to be expected that the elegant and nervous writer whose judicious sentiments and inimitable style point out the author of Lauder's preface and postscript will no longer allow one to plume himself with his feathers who appeareth so little to have deserved his assistance an assistance which I am persuaded would never have been communicated had there been the least suspicion of those facts which I have been the instrument of conveying to the world in these sheets a perusal of which will satisfy our critic who was pleased to submit his book to the judgment of the two universities that it has been examined and carefully read at least by some members of the university of Oxford  The defence of Milton which I have mentioned by Mr Richardson proves also for the honour of Cambridge that  her men of letters  were by no means deficient in such regard as they peculiarly owe to  the reputation of the poet who "flames in the van" of that poetical host which has contributed to her renown  When the pamphlet of Dr Douglas had completely unveiled the most impudent of literary frauds Johnson whom his prejudice against Milton could no longer render blind to the unworthiness of Lauder recoiled from the wretch whom he had too credulously befriended and finding him as deficient in the truth of facts as he was in propriety of sentiment and decency of language made him address to his antagonist who had convicted him of some forgeries an ample avowal of more extensive fraud and a most humble supplication for pardon This expiatory address was dictated by Johnson whose conduct on the occasion was manly and moralbut it failed to correct his associate for prejudice against Milton in Lauder arose almost to madness in Johnson it amounted only to a degree of malevolence too commonly produced by political disagreement it had induced him to cherish too eagerly a detractive deception fabricated to sink an illustrious character without allowing himself the due exercise of his keen understanding to investigate its falsehood or to perceive its absurdity Lauder seems to have hoped for some time that a full confession of his offences would restore him to the favour of the public for in the year he ventured to publish an apolgy addressed to the Archbishop of Canterbury soliciting patronage for his projected edition of  the scarce Latin authors from whom he had accused Milton of borrowing The chief purpose of so extraordinary an attack on the renown of the poet appears to have been a desire prompted by indigence to interest the public in the reappearance of these neglected writers whom he meant to republish In closing his apology to the Archbishop he says with singular confidence  As for the interpolations for which I am so highly blamed when passion is subsided and the minds of men can patiently attend to truth I promise amply to replace them with passages equivalent in value that are genuine that the public may be convinced that it was rather passion and resentment than a penury of evidence the twentieth part of which has not as yet been produced that obliged me to make use of them  He printed the collection of Latin poets as he proposed one volume in and a second in The book may be regarded as a literary curiosity but it seems to have contributed little to the emolument of its miserable editor who had thoroughly awakened universal indignation and as Dr Douglas observed in a postscript to his pamphlet reprinted in  The curiosity of the public to see any of these poems was at an end the only thing which had stamped a value upon them was a supposition that Milton had thought them worthy of his imitation As therefore it now appeared by the detection of Lauder's system of forgery that Milton had not imitated them it is no wonder that the design of  reprinting them should meet with little or no success  The assertion of this learned and amiable writer that Milton had not imitated these poets is not to be understood in a strict and literal sense for assuredly there are passages in some of them that Milton may be fairly supposed to have copied though his obligations to these Latin poets are very far from being considerable and had they been infinitely greater the inference drawn by the malevolent reviler of Milton would still have been preposterously severe  The detected slanderer was soon overwhelmed with the utter contempt he deserved but contemptible as he was the memory of his offences and of his punishment ought to be preserved not so much for the honour of Milton as for the general interest of literature that if the world can produce a second Lauder he may not hope for impunity  Part of his subsequent history is related in the following words by Dr Douglas  Grown desperate by his disappointment this very man whom but a little before we have seen as abject in the confession of his forgeries as he had been bold in the contrivance of them with an inconsistence equalled only by his impudence renewed his attack upon the author of the Paradise Lost and in a pamphlet published for that purpose acquainted the world that the true reason which had excited him to  contrive his forgery was because Milton had attacked the character of Charles the First by interpolating Pamela's prayer from the Arcadia in an edition of the Eicon Basilike hoping no doubt by this curious key to his conduct to be received into favour if not by the friends of truth at least by the idolaters of the royal martyrthe zeal of this wild partyman against Milton having at the same time extended itself against his biographer the very learned Dr Birch for no other reason but because he was so candid as to express his disbelief of a tradition unsupported by evidence  Were it requisite to give new force to the many proofs of that malignant prejudice against Milton in a late writer which I have had too frequent occasion to examine and regret such force might be drawn from the words just cited from Dr Douglas That gentleman here informs us that Lauder directed his intemperate zeal against Dr Birch for rejecting the illsupported story that represented Milton as an impostor concerned in forging the remarkable prayer of the king Yet Johnson ungenerously laboured to fix this suspicion of dishonesty on the great character whose life he delineated by insinuating that Dr Birch believed the very story which Lauder reviled him for having candidly rejected Is it not too evident from this circumstance that Lauder's intemperate hatred of Milton had in some degree infected his noble coadjutor though he very justly discarded  that impostor when convicted of forgery after writing for him a supplicatory confession of his fraud for which he was afterwards censured by the halffrantic offender who finding that it procured him no favour from the public declared it infinitely too general and too abject for the occasion  The malevolence of Johnson towards the great poet has been represented as a mere fiction of party rage acrimoniously reviling an illustrious biographer but instead of being an injurious fiction of that evil spirit it is a reality universally felt and sincerely lamented by those lovers of literature who being exempt from all party rage themselves would willingly annihilate the influence of that insidious foe to truth and justice in the republic of letters It should afford us an antidote against the poison of party rage in all literary discussions to observe that by indulging it a very strong and a very devout mind was hurried into the want of clear moral perception and of true Christian charity in describing the conduct and in scrutinizing the motives of Milton It seems as if the good angel of this extraordinary poet had determined that his poetical renown should pass like his virtue and his genius through trials most wonderfully adapted to give it lustre and hence as imagination at least may please itself in supposing hence might such enemies be combined against him as the world perhaps never saw before in a similar confederacy A base artificer of falsehood and a magnanimous teacher of  moral philosophy united in a wild endeavour to diminish his reputation but like the rash assailants of Jupiter in the fables of paganism they only confirmed the preeminence they attacked with preposterous temerity The philosopher indeed made an honourable retreat and no candid mind will severely censure him for an illstarred alliance which however clouded by prejudice he might originally form in compassion to indigence and which he certainly ended by rejection of imposture  The miserable Lauder was punished by events so calamitous that even those admirers of Milton who are most offended by the enormity of the fraud must wish that penitence and amendment had secured to this unhappy being who seems to have possessed considerable scholarship a milder destiny Finding himself unable to struggle with public odium in this country he sought an asylum in the West Indies and there died an indigent outcast and a memorable example how dangerous it is to incur the indignation of mankind by base devices to blast the reputation of departed geniusMay his wretched catastrophe preserve the literary world from being dishonoured again by artifice so detestable  I have said that the collection be published of Latin poets is entitled to some regard as a literary curiosity and it may here be proper to enumerate the authors comprized in that collection The first volume contains the Poemata Sacra of Andrew Ramsay from a copy printed at Edinburgh and the Adamus Exul of Grotius  from the edition of the Hague In the second volume we have the Sarcotis of Masenius from the edition of Cologne omitting the th and th books which may be found in a copy of the Sarcotis printed at Paris by Barbou the first book of Daemonomachia a poem by Odoricus Valmarana printed at Vienna in books Paradisus Jacobi Catsii a celebrated Dutch poetthe Paradise of Catsius is a spirited and graceful epithalamium on the nuptials of Adam and Eve originally written in the native language of the author this Latin version of it was executed by the learned Barlaeus and first printed in Bellum Angelicum Auctore Frederico Taubmanno a poem consisting of two books and a fragment of a third originally printed in  Lauder in publishing this collection of curious Latin verse has occasionally seasoned it with remarks of his own both in Latin and Englishthe tenor of them has a great tendency to confirm the apology with which Johnson excused the implicit and hasty credit that he gave to the gross forgeries of the impostor  He thought the man too frantic to be fraudulent  The language used by Lauder in the publication I am speaking of shews indeed that the contemptuous abhorrence which this unhappy scholar had conceived of Milton really bordered upon insanity Without pointing to any particular instances of plagiarism he bestows on the poet the extraordinary title of the arch felon and inserts a singular  epigram written by a servile foreigner to prove Milton an atheist Not contented with reviling the great author himself he extends the virulent attack to his nephew Philips whom he accuses of having favoured by a suspicious silence the secret practice of his uncle in riffling the treasures of others  Philips says Lauder every where in his 'Theatrum Poetarum' either wholly passes over in silence such authors as Milton was most obliged to or if he chances to mention them does it in the most slight and superficial manner imaginable  There is some acuteness and more truth in this observation concerning Philips than Lauder was himself aware of Though Milton was indeed no plagiary and his nephew of course had no thefts to conceal it is very remarkable that Philips giving an account of poets in all languages omits such of their works as were built on subjects resembling those of his uncle This omission is not only striking in the brief account he gives of the Latin poets collected by Lauder it extends to some Italian writers of whom I shall presently have occasion to speak more at large Let me first observe in apology for the omissions of Philips which are too frequent to be considered as accidental that he probably chose not to enumerate various poems relating to angels to Adam and to Paradise lest ignorance and malice should absurdly consider the mere existence of such poetry as a derogation from the glory of Milton That Philips had  himself no inconsiderable share of poetical taste and that he was laudably zealous for the honour of his uncle appears I think from the following remarks which I transcribe with pleasure from his preface to the little book I am speaking of as they seem to contain an oblique and graceful compliment to his renowned relation  A poetical fancy is much seen in a choice of verse proper to a chosen subject  Wit ingenuity and learning in verse even elegance itself though that comes nearest are one thing true native poetry is another in which there is a certain air and spirit which perhaps the most learned and judicious in other arts do not perfectly apprehend much less is it attainable by any study or industry  This certain air and spirit are assuredly most conspicuous in Milton he was a poet of nature's creation but one who added to all her endowments every advantage that study could acquire  By the force and opulence of his own fancy he was exempted from the inclination and the necessity of borrowing and retailing the ideas of other poets but rich as he was in his own proper fund he chose to be perfectly acquainted not only with the wealth but even with the poverty of others He seems to have read in different languages authors of every class and I doubt not but he had perused every poem collected by Lauder though some of them hardly afford ground enough for a conjecture that he remembered any passage they contain in the  course of his nobler composition Johnson in his preface to Lauder's pamphlet represents the Adamus Exul of Grotius as  the first draught the  prima stamina  of the Paradise Lost  The same critic observes in touching on this subject in his life of Milton  Whence he drew the original design has been variously conjectured by men who cannot bear to think themselves ignorant of that which at last neither diligence nor sagacity can discover Some find the hint in an Italian tragedy Voltaire tells a wild unauthorized story of a farce seen by Milton in Italy which opened thus 'Let the rainbow be the fiddlestick of the fiddle of heaven'  The critic was perfectly right in relinquishing his former idea concerning the Adamus Exul of Grotius but in his remark on Voltaire he shews how dangerous it is to censure any writer for what he says concerning books which the censurer has no opportunity of examining Voltaire indeed from his predominant passion for ridicule and from the rash vivacity that often led him to speak too confidently of various works from a very slight inspection of their contents is no more to be followed implicitly in points of criticism than he is on the more important article of religion but his opinions in literature are generally worth examination as he possessed no common degree of taste a perpetual thirst for universal knowledge and though not the most intimate yet perhaps the most extensive acquaintance with literary works  and literary men that was ever acquired by any individual  When Voltaire visited England in the early part of his life and was engaged in soliciting a subscription for his Henriade which first appeared under the title of  The League  he published in our language an essay on Epic Poetry a work which though written under such disadvantage possesses the peculiar vivacity of this extraordinary writer and is indeed so curious a specimen of his versatile talents that although it has been superseded by a French composition of greater extent under the same title it ought I think to have found a place in that signal monument to the name of Voltaire the edition of his works in ninetytwo volumes  As my reader may be gratified in seeing the English style of this celebrated foreigner I will transcribe without abridgment what he says of Andreini  Milton as he was travelling through Italy in his youth saw at Florence a comedy called Adamo writ by one Andreini a player and dedicated to Mary de Medicis Queen of France The subject of the play was the Fall of Man the actors God the devils the angels Adam Eve the Serpent Death and the seven mortal sins that topic so improper for a drama but so suitable to the absurd genius of the Italian stage as it was at that time was handled in a manner entirely conformable to the extravagance of the design The  scene opens with a chorus of angels and a cherubim thus speaks for the rest'Let the rainbow be the fiddlestick of the fiddle of the heavens let the planets be the notes of our music let time beat carefully the measure and the winds make the sharps c' Thus the play begins and every scene rises above the last in profusion of impertinence  Milton pierced through the absurdity of that performance to the hidden majesty of the subject which being altogether unfit for the stage yet might be for the genius of Milton and for his only the foundation of an epic poem  He took from that ridiculous trifle the first hint of the noblest work which human imagination has ever attempted and which he executed more than twenty years after  In the like manner Pythagoras owed the invention of music to the noise of the hammer of a blacksmith and thus in our days Sir Isaac Newton walking in his garden had the first thought of his system of gravitation upon seeing an apple falling from a tree  It was thus that in the year Voltaire then studying in England and collecting all possible information concerning our great epic poet accounted for the origin of Paradise Lost Rolli another foreign student in epic poetry who resided at that time in London and was engaged in translating Milton into Italian verse published some severe censures in English on the English essay of  Voltaire to vindicate both Tasso and Milton from certain strictures of sarcastic raillery which the volatile Frenchman had lavished upon both Voltaire indeed has fallen himself into the very inconsistency which he mentions as unaccountable in Dryden I mean the inconsistency of sometimes praising Milton with such admiration as approaches to idolatry and sometimes reproving him with such keenness of ridicule as borders on contempt In the course of this discussion we may find perhaps a mode of accounting for the inconsistency both of Dryden and Voltaire let us attend at present to what the latter has said of AndreiniIf the Adamo of this author really gave birth to the divine poem of Milton the Italian dramatist whatever rank he might hold in his own country has a singular claim to our attention and regard Johnson indeed calls the report of Voltaire a wild and unauthorized story and Rolli asserts in reply to it that if Milton saw the Italian drama it must have been at Milan as the Adamo in his opinion was a performance too contemptible to be endured at Florence "Andreini says the critic of Italy was a stroller un istrione of the worst age of the Italian letters" Notwithstanding these terms of contempt which one of his countrymen has bestowed upon Andreini he appears to me highly worthy of our notice for although in uniting like Shakespeare and Moliere the two different arts of writing and of acting plays he discovered not such extraordinary powers as have justly immortalized those idols of the theatre he was yet endowed  with one quality not only uncommon but such as might render him if I may hazard the expression the poetical parent of Milton The quality I mean is enthusiasm in the highest degree not only poetical but religious Even the preface that Andreini prefixed to his Adamo may be thought sufficient to have acted like lightning on the inflammable ideas of the English poet and to have kindled in his mind the blaze of celestial imagination  I am aware that in researches like the present every conjecture may abound in illusion the petty circumstances by which great minds are led to the first conception of great designs are so various and volatile that nothing can be more difficult to discover fancy in particular is of a nature so airy that the traces of her step are hardly to be discerned ideas are so fugitive that if poets in their lifetime were questioned concerning the manner in which the seeds of considerable productions first arose in their mind they might not always be able to answer the enquiry can it then be possible to succeed in such an enquiry concerning a mighty genius who has been consigned more than a century to the tomb especially when in the records of his life we can find no positive evidence on the point in question However trifling the chances it may afford of success the investigation in assuredly worthy our pursuit for as an accomplished critic has said in speaking of another poet with his usual felicity of discernment and expression  the enquiry cannot be void of entertainment whilst Milton is our  constant theme whatever may be the fortune of the chace we are sure it will lead us through pleasant prospects and a fine country  It has been frequently remarked that accident and genius generally conspire in the origin of great performances and the accidents that give an impulse to fancy are often such as are hardly within the reach of conjecture Had Ellwood himself not recorded the occurrence who would have supposed that a few words which fell from a simple youth in conversation were the real source of Paradise Regained Yet the offsprings of imagination in this point of view have a striking analogy to the productions of nature The noble poem just mentioned resembles a rare and valuable tree not planted with care and forecast but arising vigorously from a kernel dropt by a rambling bird on a spot of peculiar fertility We are perfectly assured that Milton owed one of his great poems to the ingenuous question of a young quaker and Voltaire as we have seen has asserted that he was indebted for the other to the fantastic drama of an Italian stroller It does not appear that Voltaire had any higher authority for his assertion than his own conjecture from a slight inspection of the drama which he hastily describes yet it is mere justice to this rapid entertaining writer to declare that in his conjecture there is great probability which the English reader I believe will be inclined to admit in proportion as he becomes acquainted with Andreini and his Adamo  but before we examine their merit and the degree of influence that we may suppose them to have had on the fancy of Milton let us contemplate in one view all the scattered hints which the great poet has given us concerning the grand project of his life his design of writing an epic poem  His first mention of this design occurs in the following verses of his poetical compliment to Manso  O mihi sic mea sors talem concedat amicum  Phoebaeos decorasse viros qui tam bene norit  Si quando indigenas revocabo in carmina reges  Arturumque etiam sub terris bella moventem  Aut dicam invictae sociali foedere mensae  Magnanimos heroas et O modo spiritus adsit  Frangam Saxonicas Britonum sub marte phalanges  O might so true a friend to me belong  So skill'd to grace the votaries of song  Should I recall hereafter into rhyme  The kings and heroes of my native clime  Arthur the chief who even now prepares  In subterraneous being future wars  With all his martial knights to be restor'd  Each to his seat around the fed'ral board  And O if spirit fail me not disperse  Our Saxon plund'rers in triumphant verse  COWPER  Mr Warton says in his comment on this passage  It is possible that the advice of Manso the friend of Tasso might determine our poet to a design of this kind  The conjecture of this respectable critic may appear confirmed by the following circumstanceIn the discourses on Epic Poetry which are included in the prose works of Tasso Arthur is repeatedly recommended as a proper hero for a poem Thus we find that Italy most probably suggested to Milton his first epic idea which he relinquished nor is it less probable that his second and more arduous enterprize which he accomplished was suggested to him by his perusal of Italian authors If he saw the Adamo of Andreini represented at Milan we have reason to believe that performance did not immediately inspire him with the project of writing an epic poem on our First Parents because we find that Arthur kept possession of his fancy after his return to England  In the following verses of his Epitaphium Damonis composed at that period he still shews himself attached to romantic heroes and to British story  Dicam et Pandrasidos regnum vetus Inogeniae  Brennumque Arviragumque duces priscumque Belinum  Et tandem Armoricos Britonum sub lege colonos  Tum gravidam Arturo fatali fraude Iogernen  Mendaces vultus assumptaque Gorlois arma  Merlini dolus  Of Brutus Dardan chief my song shall be  How with his barks he plough'd the British sea  First from Rutupia's tow'ring headland seen  And of his consort's reign fair Inogen  Of Brennus and Belinus brothers bold  And of Arviragus and how of old  Our hardy sires th' Armorican controll'd  And of the wife of Gorlois who surpriz'd  By Uther in her husband's form disguis'd  Such was the force of Merlin's art became  Pregnant with Arthur of heroic fame  These themes I now revolve  COWPER  In one of his controversial works published in Milton informs us what poetical ideas were then fluctuating in his mind particularly  what king or knight before the Conquest might be chosen in whom to lay the pattern of a christian hero  This project of delineating in a hero a model of christian perfection was suggested to the English poet not only by the example but by the precepts or Tasso as they are delivered in his critical discourses The epic designs of Milton were suspended we know for many years by very different pursuits and when he escaped from  the troubled sea of noise and hoarse dispute to the quiet and still air of delightful studies  Arthur had so far ceased to be his favourite that he probably exclaimed in the words of Tasso  Taccia Artù quei suoi  Erranti che di sogni empion le carte  Arthur no more thy errant knights rehearse  Who fill with idle dreams delusive verse  For Adam now reigned in his fancy not immediately as the subject of an epic poem but as a capital personage in the plan of a dramatic composition that instead of being formed on the narrow ground of Grotius in his Adamus Exul allowed a wider range to the fancy and included allegorical characters like the Adamo of Andreini  This composition first printed at Milan in and again in resembles the mysteries of our early stage and is denominated in Italian  Rappresentatione  a name which the writers of Italy apply to dramas founded on the scriptureDr Pearce has said in the preface to his review of Milton's text that he was informed an Italian tragedy existed entitled  Il Paradiso Perso  Paradise Lost but in a very extensive research I can discover no such performance There is indeed another Italian drama on the subject which I have not seen entitled  Adamo Caduto  tragedia sacra but this was not printed until some years after the return of our poet from the continent  For the benefit of commentators on our divine bard let me here insert a brief list of such Italian compositions as my possibly have afforded him some useful hints  Adamo Caduto tragedia sacra di Serafino della Salandra Cozenza Octavo  La Battaglia Celeste tra Michele e Lucifero di Antonio Alsani Palermitano Palermo Quarto  Dell Adamo di Giovanni Soranzo i due primi libri Genova Duodecimo  These little known productions on the subject of Milton are not to be found in the royal library nor in the princely collection of Lord Spencer who possesses that remarkable rarity of Italian literature the  Theseida  of Bocèacio and whose liberal passion for books is ennobled by his politeness and beneficence to men of letters  The poets of Italy were certainly favourites with Milton and perhaps his Sampson Agonistes was sounded on a sacred drama of that country La Rappresentatione di Sansone per Alessandro Roselli Siena Quarto There is probably considerable poetical merit in this piece as I find two subsequent edition  of it recorded in the historians of Italian literature yet I am unable to say whether Milton is indebted to it or not as I have never been so fortunate as to find a copy of Roselli's composition Yet the mention of it here may be useful to future editors of the English poet  It seems very probable that Milton in his collection  of Italian books had brought the Adamo of Andreini to England and that the perusal of an author wild indeed and abounding in grotesque extravagance yet now and then shining with pure and united rays of fancy and devotion first gave a new bias to the imagination of the English poet or to use the expressive phrase of Voltaire first revealed to him the  hidden majesty of the subject  The apostate angels of Andreini though sometimes hideously and absurdly disgusting yet occasionally sparkle with such fire as might awaken the emulation of Milton  I shall not attempt to produce parallel passages from the two poets because the chief idea that I mean to inculcate is not that Milton tamely copied the Adamo of Andreini but that his fancy caught fire from that spirited though irregular and fantastic compositionthat it proved in his ardent and fertile mind the seed of Paradise Lostthis is matter of mere conjecture whose probability can  only be felt in examining the Adamoto the lovers of Milton it may prove a source of amusing speculation  And as the original work of Andreini is seldom to be found it may be pleasing to the reader both of English and Italian to see in these pages a brief analysis of his drama with a short selection from a few of the most remarkable scenes  THE CHARACTERS  GOD the FATHER  CHORUS of SERAPHIM CHERUBIM and ANGELS  The archangel MICHAEL

triumphs over Lucifer  SCENE Adam Eve chorus of AngelsThey rejoice in the victory of Michael he animates the offenders with a promise of favour from God and future residence in heaven they express their hope and gratitudeThe Angels close the drama by singing the praise of the Redeemer  After this minute account of Andreini's plan the reader may be curious to see some specimens of his poetry in an English version I shall select three First the chorus of angels which serves as a prologue to the drama and has been so ludicrously described by Voltaire secondly the soliloquy of Lucifer on his first appearance and  thirdly the scene in which Eve induces Adam to taste the fruit I shall prefix to them the preface of Andreini but as these specimens of his composition might seem tedious here and too much interrupt the course of this Essay I shall detach them from it and insert them as an Appendix  The majesty of Milton appears to the utmost advantage when he is fully compared with every writer whose poetical powers have been exercised on the subject to which only his genius was equal  Let me observe however for the credit of Andreini that although he has been contemptuously called a stroller he had some tincture of classical learning and considerable piety He occasionally imitates Virgil and quotes the fathers He was born in Florence his mother was an actress highly celebrated for the excellence of her talents and the purity of her life she appeared also as an authoress and printed a volume of letters and essays to which two great poets of her country Tasso and Marini contributed each a sonnet Her memory was celebrated by her son who published at her death a collection of poems in her praise Having distinguished himself as a comedian at Milan he travelled into France in the train of the famous Mary de Medeci and obtained as an actor the favour of Lewis the XIIIth The biographical work of Count Mazzuchelli on the writers of Italy includes an account of Andreini with a list of his various productions they amount to the number of thirty  and form a singular medley of comedies and devout poems His Adamo alone seems likely to preserve his name from oblivion and that indeed can never cease to be regarded as a literary curiosity while it is believed to have given a fortunate impulse to the fancy of Milton  If it is highly probable as I think it will appear to every poetical reader who peruses the Adamo that Andreini turned the thoughts of Milton from Alfred to Adam and led him to sketch the first outlines of Paradise Lost in various plans of allegorical dramas it is possible that an Italian writer less known than Andreini first threw into the mind of Milton the idea of converting Adam into an epic personage I have now before me a literary curiosity which my accomplished friend Mr Walker to whom the literature of Ireland has many obligations very kindly sent me on his return from an excursion to Italy where it happened to strike a traveller whose mind is peculiarly awakened to elegant pursuits The book I am speaking of is entitled La Scena Tragica d'Adamo ed Eva Estratta dalli primi tre  api della Sacra Genesi e ridotta a significato Morale da Troilo Lancetta Benacense Venetia This little work is dedicated to Maria Gonzaga Dutchess of Mant  a and is nothing more than a drama in prose of the ancient form entitled a morality on the expulsion of our first parents from Paradise The author does not mention Andreini nor has he any mixture of verse in his composition but in his address to the reader he has the following very remarkable  passage after suggesting that the Mosaic history of Adam and Eve is purely allegorical and designed as an incentive to virtue he says  Una notte sognai che Moisè mi porse gratiosa espositione e misterioso significato con parole tali apunto  Dio fà parte all' huom di se stesso con l' intervento della ragione e dispone con infallibile sentenza che signoreggiando in lui la medesma sopra le sensuali voglie preservato il pomo del proprio core dalli appetiti disordinati per guiderdone di giusta obbedienza li trasforma il mondo in Paradiso Di questo s'io parlassi al sicuro formarei heroico poema convenevole a semidei  One night I dreamt that Moses explained to me the mystery almost in these words  God reveals himself to man by the intervention of reason and thus infallibly ordains that reason while she supports her sovereignty over the sensual inclinations in man and preserves the apple of his heart from licentious appetites in reward of his just obedience transforms the world into ParadiseOf this were I to speak assuredly I might form an heroic poem worthy of demigods  It strikes me as possible that these last words assigned to Moses in his vision by Troilo Lancetta might operate on the mind of Milton like the question of Ellwood and prove in his prolific fancy a kind of rich graft on the  idea he derived from Andreini and the germ of his greatest production  A sceptical critic inclined to discountenance this conjecture might indeed observe it is more probable that Milton never saw a little volume not published until after his return from Italy and written by an author so obscure that his name does not occur in Tiraboschi's elaborate history of Italian literature nor in the patient Italian chronicler of poets Quadrio though he bestows a chapter on early dramatic compositions in proseBut the mind that has once started a conjecture of this nature must be weak indeed if it cannot produce new shadows of argument in aid of a favourite hypothesisLet me therefore be allowed to advance as a presumptive proof of Milton's having seen the work of Lancetta that he makes  a similar use of Moses  and introduces him to speak a prologue in the sketch of his various plans for an allegorical drama It is indeed possible that Milton might never see the performances either of Lancetta or Andreini yet conjecture has ground enough to conclude very fairly that he was acquainted with both for Andreini wrote a long allegorical drama on Paradise and we know that the fancy of Milton first began to play with the subject according to that peculiar form of composition Lancetta treated it also in the shape of a dramatic allegory but said at the same time under the character of Moses that the subject might form an incomparable epic  poem and Milton quitting his own hasty sketches of allegorical dramas accomplished a work which answers to that intimation  After all I allow that the province of conjecture is the region of shadows and as I offer my ideas on this topic rather as phantoms that may amuse a lover of poetical speculation than as solid proofs to determine a cause of great moment I am persuaded every goodnatured reader will treat them with indulgence assuredly I shall feel neither anger nor inclination to contend in their defence if any severer critic  Irruat frustra ferro diverberet umbras  In mentioning the imperfect rudiments of Paradise Lost Johnson says very justly  It is pleasant to see great works in their seminal state pregnant with latent possibilities of excellence nor could there be any more delightful entertainment than to trace their gradual growth and expansion and to observe how they are sometimes suddenly advanced by accidental hints and sometimes slowly improved by steady meditation  Such entertainment would indeed be peculiarly delightful in respect to Milton It is in some measure beyond our reach because if we except his sketches of plans for an allegorical drama no real evidence is left concerning the origin and progress of his magnificent conception but supposition is often a pleasant substitute for absolute knowledge and in the hope that it may prove so in the present case  let me advance in this shadowy research and after accounting for the first flashes of Milton's subject on his fancy pursue the vein of conjecture in considering various ideas that might influence him in the prosecution of his work  When Adam engaged the fancy of Milton however that personage might first be impressed upon it as a subject of verse many circumstances might conspire to confirm his ascendency The work of different arts which the poet surveyed in his travels had perhaps a considerable influence in attaching his imagination to our first parentsHe had most probably contemplated them not only in the colours of Michael Angelo who decorated Rome with his picture of the creation but in the marble of Bandinelli who had executed two large statues of Adam and Eve which though they were far from satisfying the taste of connoisseurs might stimulate even by their imperfections the genius of a poet In recollecting how painting and sculpture had both exercised their respective powers on these hallowed and interesting characters the muse of Milton might be tempted to contend with the sister arts I must confess however that Richardson a fond idolater of these arts and of Milton is rather inclined to believe that they did not much occupy the attention of the poet even during his residence in Italy yet I am persuaded he must have been greatly struck by the works of Michael Angelo a genius whom he resembled so much in his grand characteristic mental magnificence  and to whom he was infinitely superior in the attractive excellencies of delicacy and grace In touching on a point of resemblance between the poet and this preeminent artist we cannot fail to observe the abundance and variety of charms in the poetry of Milton All the different perfections which are assigned as characteristics to the most celebrated painters are united in this marvellous poet He has the sublime grandeur of Michael Angelo the chaste simplicity of Raphael the sweetness of Correggio and the richness of Rubens In his Sampson we may admire the force of Rembrandt and in his Comus the grace and gaiety of Albano and Poussin in short there is no charm exhibited by painting which his poetry has failed to equal as far as analogy between the different arts can extend If Milton did not pay much attention in his travels to those works of the great painters that he had opportunities of surveying which I cannot think probable it is certain that his own works afford a most excellent field to exercise and animate the powers of the pencil  The learned ingenious enthusiastic Winckelman has advanced in his most celebrated work a very different opinion but the ardour with which this extraordinary man had studied and idolized the antients rendered him deplorably presumptuous and precipitate in several of his ideas relating to modern genius and particularly in what he has asserted of Milton Some passionate admirers of antiquity seem to lament the fall of paganism as fatal to poetry to painting and to sculpture but a more liberal and enlightened spirit of criticism may rather believe what it is very possible I apprehend to demonstrate that christianity can hardly be more favourable to the purity of morals than it might be rendered to the perfection of these delightful arts Milton himself may be regarded is an obvious and complete proof that the position is true as far as poetry is concerned In what degrees the influence of the Christian religion can affect the other two it may be pleasing and perhaps useful to consider in some future composition devoted to their advancement  The article in which I apprehend  a painter must find it most difficult to equal the felicity of the poet is the delineation of his apostate angels Here perhaps poetry has some important advantage over her sister art and even poetry herself is considered by austerer critics as unequal to the task Johnson regarded the book of Paradise Lost which describes the war of Heaven as fit to be "the favourite of children"Imagination itself may be depreciated by the austerity of logic as a childish faculty but those who love even its excesses may be allowed to exult in its delights No reader truly poetical ever perused the sixth book of Milton without enjoying a kind of transport which a stern logician might indeed condemn but which he might also think it more desirable to share I doubt not but while Milton was revolving his subject in his mind he often heard from critical acquaintance such remarks as might have induced him had his imagination been less energetic to relinquish the angels as intractable beings ill suited to the sphere of poetry But if his glowing spirit was ever damped for a moment by suggestions of this nature he was probably reanimated and encouraged by recollecting his respectable old acquaintance the poets of Italy He had not only seen the infernal powers occasionally delineated with great majesty and effect in the Jerusalem of Tasso and Marini's "Slaughter of the Innocents" but he was probably acquainted with an Italian poem little known in England and formed expressly on the conflict of the apostate spirits The work I allude to is the Angeleida  of Erasmo Valvasone printed at Venice in This poet was of a noble family in the Venetian republic as his health was delicate he devoted himself to retired study and cultivated the Muses in his castle of Valvasone His works are various and one of his early compositions was honoured by the applause of Tasso His Angeleida consists of three cantos on the War of Heaven and is singularly terminated by a sonnet addressed to the triumphant Archangel Michael Several passages in Valvasone induce me to think that Milton was familiar with his workI will only transcribe the verses in which the Italian poet assigns to the infernal powers the invention of artillery  Di salnitro e di zolfo oscura polve  Chiude altro in ferro cavo e poi la tocca  Dietro col foco e in foco la risolve  Onde fragoso tuon subito scocca  Scocca e lampeggia e una palla volve  Al cui scontro ogni duro arde e trabocca  Crud' è 'l saetta ch' imitar s'attenta  L' arme che 'l sommo Dio dal Cielo aventa  L'Angelo rio quando a concorrer sorse  Di saper di bellezza e di possanza  Con l' eterno fattor perche s'accorse  Quell' arme non aver ch' ogni arme avanza  L' empio ordigno a compor l' animo torse  Che ferir puo del folgore a sembianza  E con questo a' di nostri horrido in terra  Tiranno arma di folgori ogni guerra  Valvasone acknowledges in his preface that he had been censured for having  spoken so materially  ragionato cosi materialmente of angels who are only spirit But he defends himself very ably on this point and mentions with gratitude two excellent critical discourses written in his vindication by Giovanni Ralli and Ottavio Meninithere is a third also according to Quadrio by Scipione di Manzano under the name of Olimpo Marcucci printed at Venice in to They all bestow great praise on the author whom they vindicate who appears to have been a very amiable man and a poet of considerable powers though he possessed not the sublimity and the refinement of Milton or Tasso In his general ideas of poetry he resembled them both and in his mode of expressing himself in the preface to his Angeleida he reminds me very strongly of those passages in the prose works of Milton where he speaks on the hallowed magnificence of the art They both considered sacred subjects as peculiarly proper for verse an idea condemned by Johnson who sympathised as little with Milton in his poetic as in his political principles It was by entertaining ideas of poetry directly contrary to those of his critic that Milton rendered himself  in true dignity the first poet of the world Nor can we think that dignity in any degree impaired by discovering that many hints might be suggested to him by various poets in different languages who had seized either a part or the whole of his subject before him On the contrary the more of these we can discover and the more we compare them with the English bard the more reason we shall find to exult in the preeminence of his poetical powers Tasso in his critical discourses inculcates a very just maxim concerning the originality of epic poets which is very applicable to Milton  Nuovo sarà il poema in cui nuova sara la testura de' nodi nuove le solutioni nuovi gli episodi che per entro vi sono traposti quantunque la materia fosse notissima e dagli altri prima trattata perche la novita del poema si considera piuttosto alla forma che alla materia  This great writer illustrates his position that the novelty of a poem is to be estimated more from its form than its subject by the example of Alamanni an epic poet of Italy who lost the praise he might otherwise have acquired by copying too fondly under modern names the incidents of Homer Milton is of all authors undoubtedly one of the most original both in thought and expression the language of his greater works is evidently borrowed from no model but it seems to have great conformity with the precepts which Tasso has delivered in the discourses I have just cited for the formation of  an epic style Yet in criticism as in politics Milton was undoubtedly  Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri  He thought on every topic for himself justly remarking that  to neglect rules and follow nature in them that know art and use judgment is no transgression but an enriching of art  This excellent maxim insured to him the exercise and the independence of his own elevated mind There is frequent allusion to the works of antiquity in Milton yet no poet perhaps who revered the ancients with such affectionate enthusiasm has copied them so little This was partly owing to the creative opulence of his own genius and partly to his having fixed on a subject so different from those of Homer and Virgil that he may be said to have accomplished a revolution in poetry and to have purified and extended the empire of the epic muse One of the chief motives that induced his imagination to desert its early favourite Arthur and attach itself to our first parents is partly explained in those admirable verses of the ninth book where the poet mentions the choice of his own subject contrasted with those of his illustrious predecessors  Argument  Not less but more heroic than the wrath  Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued  Thrice fugitive about Troy wall or rage  Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd  Or Neptune's ire or Juno's that so long  Perplex'd the Greek and Cytherea's son    This subject for heroic song  Pleas'd me long choosing and beginning late  Not sedulous by nature to indite  Wars hitherto the only argument  Heroic deem'd chief mast'ry to dissect  With long and tedious havoc fabled knights  In battles seign'd the better fortitude  Of patience and heroic martyrdom  Unsung or to describe races and games  Or tilting furniture imblazon'd shields  Impresses quaint caparisons and steeds  Bases and tinsel trappings gorgeous knights  At joust and torneament then marshal'd feast  Serv'd up in hall with sewers and seneschals  The skill of artifice or office mean  Not that which justly gives heroic name  To person or to poem me of these  Nor skill'd nor studious higher argument  Remains sufficient of itself to raise  That name  Milton seems to have given a purer signification than we commonly give to the word hero and to have thought  it might be assigned to any person eminent and attractive enough to form a principal figure in a great picture In truth when we recollect the etymology which a philosopher and a saint have left us of the term we cannot admire the propriety of devoting it to illustrious homicides Plato derives the Greek word from others that imply either eloquence or love and St Augustine from the Grecian name of Juno or the air because original heroes were pure departed spirits supposed to reside in that element In Milton's idea the ancient heroes of epic poetry seem to have too much resembled the modern great man according to the delineation of that character in Fielding's exquisite history of Jonathan Wild the Great Much as the English poet delighted in the poetry of Homer he appears to have thought like an American writer of the present age whose fervent passion for the Muses is only inferior to his philanthropy that the Grecian bard though celebrated as the prince of moralists by Horace and esteemed a teacher of virtue by St Basil has too great a tendency to nourish that sanguinary madness in mankind which has continually made the earth a theatre of carnage I am afraid that some poets and historians may have been a little accessary to the innumerable massacres with which men ambitious of obtaining the title of hero have desolated the world and it is certain that a severe judge of Homer may with some plausibility apply to him the reproach that his Agamemnon utters to Achilles  For all thy pleasure is in strife and blood  Yet a lover of the Grecian bard may observe in his defence that in assigning these words to the leader of his host he shews the pacific propriety of his own sentiments and that however his verses may have instigated an Alexander to carnage or prompted the calamitous frequency of war even this pagan poet so famous as the describer of battles detested the objects of his description  But whatever may be thought of the heathen bard Milton to whom a purer religion had given greater purity and I think greater force of imagination Milton from a long survey of human nature had contracted such an abhorrence for the atrocious absurdity of ordinary war that his feelings in this point seem to have influenced his epic fancy He appears to have relinquished common heroes that he might not cherish the too common characteristic of mana sanguinary spirit He aspired to delight the imagination like Homer and to produce at the same time a much happier effect on the mind Has he succeeded in this glorious idea Assuredly he hasto please is the end of poetry Homer pleases perhaps more universally than Milton but the pleasure that the English poet excites is more exquisite in its nature and superior in its effect An eminent  painter of France used to say that in reading Homer he felt his nerves dilated and he seemed to increase in stature Such an ideal effect as Homer in this example produced on the body Milton produces in the spirit To a reader who thoroughly relishes the two poems on Paradise his heart appears to be purified in proportion to the pleasure he derives from the poet and his mind to become angelic Such a taste for Milton is rare and the reason why it is so is thisTo form it completely a reader must possess in some degree what was superlatively possessed by the poet a mixture of two different species of enthusiasm the poetical and the religious To relish Homer it is sufficient to have a passion for excellent verse but the reader of Milton who is only a lover of the Muses loses half and certainly the best half of that transcendent delight which the poems of this divine enthusiast are capable of imparting A devotional taste is as requisite for the full enjoyment of Milton as a taste for poetry and this remark will sufficiently explain the inconsistency so striking in the sentiments of many distinguished writers who have repeatedly spoken on the great English poetparticularly that inconsistency which I partly promised to explain in the judgments of Dryden and Voltaire These very different men had both a passion for verse and both strongly felt the poetical powers of Milton but Dryden perhaps had not much and Voltaire had certainly not a particle of Milton's religious enthusiasm  hence instead of being impressed with the sanctity of his subject they sometimes glanced upon it in a ludicrous point of view  Hence they sometimes speak of him as the very prince of poets and sometimes as a misguided genius who has failed to obtain the rank he aspired to in the poetical world But neither the caprices of conceit nor the cold austerity of reason can reduce the glory of this preeminent bardIt was in an hour propitious to his renown that he relinquished Arthur and Merlin for Adam and the Angels and he might say on the occasion in the words of his admired Petrarch  Io benedico il luogo il tempo e l' hora  Che si alto miraro gli occhi mïei  I bless the spot the season and the hour  When my presumptuous eyes were fix'd so high  To say that his poem wants human interest is only to prove that he who finds that defect wants the proper sensibility of man A work that displays at full length and in the strongest light the delicious tranquillity of innocence the tormenting turbulence of guilt and the consolatory satisfaction of repentance has surely abundance of attraction to awaken sympathy The images and sentiments that belong to these varying situations are so suited to our mortal existence that they cannot cease to interest while human nature endures The human heart  indeed may be too much depraved and the human mind may be too licentious or too gloomy to have a perfect relish for Milton but in honour of his poetry we may observe that it has a peculiar tendency to delight and to meliorate those characters in which the seeds of taste and piety have been happily sown by nature In proportion as the admiration of mankind shall grow more and more valuable from the progressive increase of intelligence of virtue and of religion this incomparable poet will be more affectionately studied and more universally admired  APPENDIX CONTAINING EXTRACTS FROM THE  ADAMO OF ANDREINI  WITH AN ANALYSIS OF ANOTHER ITALIAN DRAMA ON THE SAME SUBJECT  Al benigno LETTORE  SAZIO e stanco lettor discreto d'haver con l'occhio della fronte troppo fiso rimirate queste terrene cose quel della mente una volta inabzando a piu belle considerazioni e alle tante meraviglie sparse dal summo Dio a benefizio dell' huomo per l' universo sentii passarmi il cuore da certo stimolo et da non so che christiano compungimento vedendo come offesa in ogni tempo da noi gravemente quella inneffabile bonta benigna ad ogni modo ci si mostrasse quelle in un continuo stato di benificenza ad uso nostro conservando e come una sol volta provocata a vendetta oltre i suo vasti consini non allargasse il mare al sole non oscurasse la luce sterile non facesse la terra per abissarci per acciécarsi e per distruggersi sinalmente E tutto internato in questi divini affetti me sentij rapire a me stesso e traportare da dolce violenza là nel terrestre paradiso ove pur di veder mi parea l'huomo primiero Adamo fattura cara di Dio amico de gli angeli herede del cielo familiar delle stelle compendio delle cose create ornamento del tutto miracolo della natura imperador de gli animali unico albergatore dell' universo et fruitore di tante maraviglie e grandezze Quindi invaghito  encor piu che mai risolvei co 'l favor di Dio benedetto de dare alla luce del mondo quel che io portava nelle tenebre della mea mente si per dare in qualche modo a conoscere ch' io conosceva me stesso e gli oblighi infiniti ch' io tengo a Dio come perche altri che non conoscono sapessero chi fu chi sia et chi sara quest' huomo e dalla bassa considerazione di queste cose terrene alzasser la mente a le celeste e divine Stetti pero gran pezza in forse s' io doveva e poteva tentare composizione a me per molti capi dissicillissima poiche cominciando la sacra tela della creazione dell' huomo sin la dov' é scacciato dal paradiso terrestre che sei hore vi corsero come ben narra Sant Agostino nel libro nella Citta di Dio non ben lo vedeva come in cinque atti soli si brieve fatto raccontar si potesse tanto piu disegnando per ogni atto il numero almeno di sei o sette scene Difficile per la disputa che fece il Demonio con Eva prima che l' inducesse a mangiare il pomo poi che altro non abiamo se non il testo che ne faccia menzione dicendo "Nequaquam moriemini et eritis sicut Dii scientes bonum et malum" Difficile per le parole d' Eva in persuadere Adamo che pur aveva il dono della scienza infusa à gustar del pomo ma dissicillissima sopra tutto per la mia debolezza poiche doveva la composizione rimaner priva di quegli ornamenti poetici cosi cari alle muse priva di poter trarre le comparazioni da cose fabrili introdotte co 'l volger de gli anni poiche al tempo del primo huomo non v' era cosa Priva pur di nominar mentre pero parla Adamo e con lui si ragiona per essempio archi strali bipenni urne coltelli spade aste trombe tamburri  trofei vessilli arringhi martelli faci mantici roghi teatri errari e somiglianti cose ed insinite havendole tutte introdotte la necessita del peccato commesso e pero come afflitive e di pena non dovevan passar per la mente ne per la bocca d' Adamo ben che avesse la scienza insusa come quegli che nel innocenza felicessimo si vivea E priva eziandio del portare in campo fatti d' historie sacre o profane del racontare menzogne di savolosi dei di narrare amori furori armi caccie pescaggioni trionsi naufragi incendi incanti e simile cose che sono in vero l' ornamento e lo spirito della poesia Difficile per non sapere in che stile dovesse parlare Adamo perche risguardando al saper suo meritava i versi intieri grandi sostenuti numerosi ma considerandolo poi pastore e albergatoré de' boschi pare che puro e dolce esser dovesse nel suo parlare e m' accostai percio a questo di renderlo tale piu ch' io potessi con versi interi e spezzati e desinenze E qui preso animo nel maggior mio dubio diedi non so come principio andai per cosi dire senza mezo seguendo e guinsi al fine nè me ne avvide Onde ho da credere che la bonta di Dio risguardando piu tosto l' affetto bono che i miei diffetti si come retira spesso il cuor dell' huomo dall' opre male cosi l' induce insensibilemente ancora alle buone fosse quella che mi movesse la mano e che l' opera mi terminasse Dunque a lei sola debbo le grazie de quella poea che peraventura si trova nella presente fatica sapendo che l' omnipotenza sua avezza a trarre maraviglie dal rozo e informe chaos cosi da quello molto piu rozo e informe della mia mente habbia anche tratto questo parto  si non per altro per esser sacro e perche per cosi dire parlasse un mutolo in persona mia per la poverta dell' ingegno come suole al incontro far amutire le piu felici lingue quando s' impiegano in cose brutte e profane Vedasi dunque con l' occhio de la diserezione ne si biafimi peravventura la poverta dello stile la poca gravita nel portar delle cose la sterilita de concetti la debolenzza de gli spiriti gli insipidi sali gli stravaganti episodii come a dire per lasciare una insinita d' altre cose che il mondo la carne e 'l diavolo per tentare Adamo in forma humana gli s' appresentino poi ch' altro huomo né ultra donna non v' era al mondo poiche il serpente si mostro pure ad Eva con parte humana oltre che si fa questo perche le cose sieno piu intese dall' intelletto con que mezi che a sensi s' aspettano poscia che in altra guisa come le tante tentazioni che in un punto sostennero Adamo ed Eva furono nell' interno della lor mente cosi non ben capir lo spettaler le poteva Ne si de credere che passasse il serpente con Eva disputa lunga poiché la tento in un punto piu nella mente che con la lingua dicendo quelle parole "Nequaquam moriemini et eritis sicut Dii" c et pur fara di mestieri per esprimere quegli interni contrasti meditar qualche cose per di fuori rappresentarli Ma se al pittor poeta muto è permesso con carratteri di colore l' esprimer l' antichita di Dio in persona d' huomo tutto canuto e dimostrare in bianca colomba la purita dello spirito e figurare i divini messaggi che sono gli angeli in persona de giovani alati perche non è permesso  al poeta pittor parlante portar nella tela del theatro altra huomo altra donna ch' Adamo ed Eva e rappresentare quegli interni contrasti per mezo d' immagini e voci pur tutte humane Oltre che par piu tolerabile l'introdurre in quest' opera il demonio in humana figura di quel che sia l'

anima la miseria ed il pianto d' Adamo e farne spettatore il tuo cuore per alzarlo da queste bassezze alle grandezze del ciel co 'l mezo della virtu e dell' aiuto de Dio il quale ti feliciti  To the courteous READER  SATIATED and fatigued gentle render by having looked on these earthly objects with eyes too intent and raising therefore the eye of my mind to higher contemplations to the wonders diffused by the supreme Being for the benefit of man through the universe I felt my heart penetrated by a certain christian compunction in reflecting how his inexpressible goodness though perpetually and grievously offended by us still shews itself in the highest degree indulgent towards us in preserving those wonders with a continued influence to our advantage and how on the first provocation to vengeance Almighty Power does not enlarge the ocean to pass its immense boundary does not obscure the light of the sun does not impress sterility on the earth to engulph us to blind us and finally to destroy us Softened and absorbed in these divine emotions I felt myself transported and hurried by a delightful violence into a terrestrial paradise where I seemed to behold the first man Adam a creature dear to God the friend of angels the heir of heaven familiar with the stars a compendium of all created things the ornament of all the miracle of nature lord of the animals the only inhabitant of the universe and enjoyer of a scene so wonderfully grand Whence charmed  more than ever I resolved with the favour of the blessed God to usher into the light of the world what I bore in the darkness of my imagination both to render it known in some measure that I know myself and the infinite obligations that I have to God and that others who do not know may learn the true nature of man and from the low contemplation of earthly things may raise their mind to things celestial and divine  I remained however a considerable time in doubt if I ought or if I were able to undertake a composition most difficult to me on many accounts since in beginning the sacred subject from man's creation to the point where he is driven from the terrestrial paradise a period of six hours as Saint Augustine relates in his book on the City of God I did not clearly perceive how an action so brief could be formed into five acts especially allowing to every act the number of at least six or seven scenes difficult from the dispute that the Devil maintained with Eve before he could induce her to eat the apple since we have only the text that mentions it in saying "Nequaquam moriemini et critis sicut Dii scientes bonum et malum" difficult from the words of Eve in persuading Adam who had indeed the gift of knowledge infused to taste the apple but difficult above all from my own infirmity since the composition must remain deprived of those poetic ornaments so dear to the muses deprived of the power to draw comparisons from implements of art introduced in the course of years since in the time of the first man there was no such things deprived  so of naming at least while Adam speaks or discourse is held with him for example bows arrows batchers urns knives swords  spears trumpets drums trophies banners lists hammers torches bellows funeral piles theatres exchequers infinite things of a like nature introduced by the necessities of sin they ought not to pass through the mind or through the lips of Adam although he had knowledge infused into him as one who lived most happy in a state of innocence deprived moreover of introducing points of history sacred or profane of relating fictions of fabulous deities of rehearsing loves furies arms sports of hunting or fishing triumphs shipwrecks conflagrations inchantments and things of a like nature that are in truth the ornament and the soul of poetry difficult from not knowing in what stile Adam ought to speak since in respect to his knowledge it might be proper to assign to him verses of a high majestic and flowing stile but considering him as a shepherd and an inhabitant of the woods it appears that he should be simple and sweet in his discourse and I endeavoured on that account to render it such as much as I could by variety of versification and here taking courage in my greatest doubt I formed I know not how a beginning I advanced if I may say so without any determinate plan and arrived at the end before I was aware Whence I am inclined to believe that the savour of God regarding rather my good intentions than my defects for as he often withdraws the heart of man from evil so he conducts it insensibly to good gave direction to my hand and completed my work Wherefore to that alone I am indebted for the little grace that may perhaps be found in the present labour knowing that as omnipotence is accustomed to produce wonders from the rude and unformed chaos so from the still ruder chaos of my mind it may have called forth  this production if not for any other purpose yet to be sacred and to make as it were a mute speak in my person in despight of poverty of genius as on the other hand it is accustomed to strike mute the most eloquent tongues when they employ themselves on subjects low and profane Let it be surveyed therefore with an eye of indulgence and blame not the poverty of stile the want of dignity in the conduct of the circumstances sterility of conceits weakness of spirit insipid pleasantries and extravagant episodes to mention without speaking of an infinitude of other things that the world the flesh and the devil present themselves in human shapes to tempt Adam since there was then in the universe no other man or woman and the serpent discovered himself to Eve with a human similitude moreover this is done that the subject may be better comprehended by the understanding through the medium of the senses since the great temptations that Adam and Eve at once sustained were indeed in the interior of their own mind but could not be so comprehended by the spectator nor is it to be believed that the serpent held a long dispute with Eve since he tempted her rather by a suggestion to her mind than by conference saying these words "Nequaquam moriemini et eritis sicut Dii scientes bonum et malum" and yet it will be necessary in order to express those internal contentions to find some expedient to give them an outward representation but if it is permitted to the painter who is a dumb poet to express by colours God the Father under the person of a man silvered by age to describe under the image of a white dove the purity of the spirit and to figure the divine messengers or angels under the shape of winged youths  why is it not permitted to the poet who is a speaking painter to represent in his theatrical production another man and another woman besides Adam and Eve and to represent their internal conflicts through the medium of images and voices entirely human not to mention that it appears more allowable to introduce in this work the devil under a human shape than it is to introduce into it the eternal Father and an angel and if this is permitted and seen every day exhibited in sacred representations why should it not be allowed in the present where if the greater evil is allowable surely the less should be allowed attend therefore gentle reader more to the substance than to the accident considering in the work the great end of introducing into the theatre of the soul the misery and lamentation of Adam to make your heart a spectator of them in order to raise it from these dregs of earth to the magnificence of heaven through the medium of virtue and the assistance of God by whom may you be blessed  CHORO D' ANGELI  cantanti la  GLORIA DI DIO  A LA lira del Ciel Iri sia l' arco  Corde le sfere sien note le stelle

be the bow  Adapt the spheres for chords for notes the stars  Let newborn gales discriminate the bars  Nor let old time to measure times be slow  Hence to new music of the eternal lyre  Add richer harmony and praise to praise  For him who now his wond'rous might displays  And shews the universe its awful sire  O thou who ere the world or heav'n was made  Didst in thyself that world that heav'n enjoy  How does thy bounty all its powers employ  What inexpressive good hast thou displayed  O thou of sov'reign love almighty source  Who know'st to make thy works thy love express  Let pure devotion's fire the soul possess  And give the heart and hand a kindred force  Then shalt thou hear how when the world begun  Thy lifeproducing voice gave myriads birth  Call'd forth from nothing all in heav'n and earth  Bless'd in thy light as eagles in the sun  ATTO PRIMO SCENA SECONDA  LUCIFERO  CHI dal mio centro oscuro  Mi chiama a rimirar cotanta luce  Quai meraviglie nove  Hoggi mi scopri O Dio  Forse sei stanco d' albergar nel cielo  Perche creasti in terra  Quel vago paradiso  Per che reporvi poi  D' humana carne duo terreni dei  Dimmi architetto vile  Che di fango opre festi  Ch'

stella à stella  V' aggiunga e luna e sole  S' affatichi pur Dio  Per far di novo il ciel lucido adorno  Ch' al sin con biasmo e scorno  Vana l' opra sara vana il sudore  Fu Lucifero sol quell' ampia luce  Per cui splendeva in mille raggi il cielo  Ma queste faci hor sue son ombre e fumi  O de' gran lumi miei bastardi lumi  Il ciel che che si sia saper non voglio  Che che si sia quest' huom' saper

abyss  Calls me to gaze on this excess of light  What miracles unseen  Shew'st thou to me O God  Art thou then tired of residence in Heav'n  Why hast thou raised on earth  This lovely paradise  And wherefore placed in it  Two earthly demigods of human mould  Say thou vile architect  Forming thy works of dust  What will befal this naked helpless man  The sole inhabitant of glens and woods  Does he then dream of treading on the stars  Heav'n is impoverish'd and I alone  The cause enjoy the ruin I produced  Let him unite above  Star upon star moon sun  And let his Godhead toil  To readorn and reillume his heav'n  Since in the end derision  Shall prove his works and all his efforts vain  For Lucifer alone was that full light  Which scatter'd radiance o'er the plains of Heav'n  But these his present fires are shade and smoke  Base counterfeits of my more potent beams  I reck not what he means to make his heav'n  Nor care I what this creature man may be  Too obstinate and firm  Is my undaunted thought  In proving that I am implacable  'Gainst heav'n 'gainst man the angels and their God  ATTO TERZA SCENA PRIMA  ADAMO EVA  OMIA compagna amata  O di questa mia vita  Vero cor cara

thou with such excess of tender haste  With ceaseless pilgrimage  To find again thy Adam  Thus solitary wandered  Behold him speak what are thy gentle orders  Why dost thou pause O God what art thou doing  EVE  Adam my best beloved  My guardian and my guide  Thou source of all my comfort all my joy  Thee thee alone I wish  And in these pleasing horrors  Thee only have I sought  ADAM  Since thou may'st call thy Adam  Most beautiful companion  The source and happy fountain of thy joy  Eve if to walk with me  It now may please thee I will shew thee love  A sight thou hast not seen  A sight so lovely that in wonder thou  Wilt arch thy graceful brow  Look thou my gentle bride towards that path  Of this so intricate and verdant grove  Where sit the birds embower'd  Just there where now with soft and snowy plumes  Two social doves have spread their wings for flight  Just there thou shalt behold O pleasing wonder  Springing amid the flow'rs  A living stream that with a winding course  Flies rapidly away  And as it flies allures  And tempts you to exclaim sweet river stay  Hence eager in pursuit  You follow and the stream as if it had  Desire to sport with you  Thro' many a florid many a grassy way  Well known to him in soft concealment flies  But when at length he hears  You are afflicted to have lost his sight  He rears his watry locks and seems to say  Gay with a gurgling smile  Follow ah follow still my placid course  If thou art pleased with me with thee I sport  And thus with sweet deceit he leads you on  To the extremest bound  Of a fair flow'ry meadow then at once  With quick impediment  Says stop adieu for now yes now I leave you  Then down a rock descends  There as no human foot can follow farther  The eye alone must follow him and there  In little space you see a mass of water  Collected in a deep and fruitful vale  With laurel crowned and olive  With cypress oranges and lofty pines  The limpid water in the sun's bright ray  A perfect crystal seems  Hence in its deep recess  In the translucent wave  You see a precious glittering sand of gold  And bright as moving silver  Innumerable fish  Here with melodious notes  The snowy swans upon the shining streams  Form their  eet residence  And seem in warbling to the wind to say  Here let those r  t who wish for perfect joy  So that my dear companion  To walk with me will please thee  EVE  So well thy language to my sight has brought  What thou desiredst to shew me  I see thy flying river as it sports  And hear it as it murmurs  And beauteous also is this scene where now  Pleas'd we sojourn and here perhaps e'en here  The lilly whitens with the purest lustre  And the rose reddens with the richest hue  Here also bath'd in dew  Plants of minutest growth  Are painted all with flowers  Here trees of amplest leaf  Extend their rival shades  And stately rise to heav'n  ADAM  Now by these cooling shades  The beauty of these plants  By these delightful meadows  These variegated flow'rs  By the soft music of the rills and birds  Let us sit down in joy  EVE  Behold then I am seated  How I rejoice in viewing not alone  These flow'rs these herbs these high and graceful plants  But Adam more my lover  Thou thou art he by whom the meadows seem  More beautiful to me  The fruit more blooming and the streams more clear  ADAM  These decorated fields  With all their flow'ry tribute cannot equal  Those lovelier flowers that with delight I view  In the fair garden of your beauteous face  Be pacified ye flow'rs  My words are not untrue  You shine besprinkl'd with aetherial dew  You give the humble earth to grow with joy  At one bright sparkle of the blazing sun  But with the falling sun ye also fall  But these more living flow'rs  Of my dear beauteous Eve  Seem freshen'd every hour  By soft devotion's dew  That she with pleasure sheds  Praising her mighty Maker  And by the rays of two terrestrial suns  In that pure Heav'n her face  They rise and not to fall  Decking the Paradise  Of an enchanting visage  EVE  Dear Adam do not seek  With tuneful eloquence  To sooth my ear by speaking of thy love  The heart is confident  That fondly flames with pure and hallow'd ardour  In sweet exchange accept my gentle love  This vermeil tinctur'd gift you know it well  This is the fruit forbidden  This is the blessed apple  ADAM  Alas what see I Ah what hast thou done  Invader of the fruit  Forbidden by thy God  EVE  It would be long to tell  The reason that induced me  To make this fruit my prey let it suffice  I've gained thee wings to raise thy flight to heav'n  ADAM  Ne'er be it true ah never  That to obtain thy favour  I prove to Heav'n rebellious and ungrateful  And to obey a woman  So disobey my Maker and my God  Then did not death denounc'd  With terror's icy paleness blanch thy cheek  EVE  And think'st thou if the apple  Were but the fruit of death  The great Producer would have raised it there  Where being is eternal  Think'st thou that if of error  This fruittree were the cause  In man's delighted eye  So fertile and so fair  He would have form'd it flourishing in air  Ah were it so he would indeed have giv'n  A cause of high offence  Since nature has ordain'd  A monitress sagacious  That to support his being man must eat  And trust in what looks fair as just and good  ADAM  If the celestial tiller  Who the fair face of heav'n  Has thickly sown with stars  Amidst so many plants fruitful and fair  Placed the forbidden apple  The fairest and most sweet  'Twas to make proof of man  As a wise keeper of his heav'nly law  And to afford him scope for high desert  For he alone may gain the name of brave  Who rules himself and all his own desires  Man might indeed find some excuse for sin  If scantily with fruits  This garden were supplied  But this abounding in so many sweets  Man ought not to renounce  The clear command of heav'n  EVE  And is it thus you love me  Ne'er be it true ah never  That I address you as my heart my life  From you alone I'll wander  Bath'd in my tears and sighing  And hating e'en myself  I'll hide me from the sun  ADAM  Dear Eve my sweetest love  My spirit and my heart  O haste to dry thine eyes  For mine are all these tears  That bathe thy cheek and stream upon thy bosom  EVE  Ah my unhappy state  I that so much have said so much have done  To elevate this man  Above the highest heav'n and now so little  Can he or trust or love me  ADAM  Ah do not grieve my life  Too much it wounds my soul  To see thee in affliction  EVE  I know your sole desire  Is to be witness to my sighs and tears  Hence to the winds and seas  I pay this bitter tribute  ADAM  Alas my heart is splitting  What can I do When I look up to heav'n  I feel an icy tremor  E'en thro' my bones oppress me  Anxious alone to guard the heav'nly precept  If I survey my partner  I share her tears and echo back her sighs  'Tis torture and distraction  To wound her with refusal my kind heart  Would teach my op'ning hand to seize the apple  But in my doubtful breast  My spirit bids it close  Adam thou wretch how many  Various desires besiege thy trembling heart  One prompts thee now to sigh  Another to rejoice nor canst thou know  Which shall incline thee most  Or sighs or joyous favour  From woman or from God  EVE  Yet he reflects and wishes  That Eve should now forsake  Her hope of being happy  In elevating man  E'en while I hold the fruit of exaltation  ADAM  Tho' mute yet eloquent  Are all your looks my love  Alas whate'er you ask  You 're certain to obtain  And my heart grants before your tongue can speak  Eyes that to me are suns  The heav'n of that sweet face  No more no more obscure  Return alas return  To scatter radiance o'er that cloudy cheek  Lift up O lift thy brow  From that soft mass of gold that curls around it  Locks like the solar rays  Chains to my heart and lightning to my eyes  O let thy lovely tresses  Now light and unconfined  Sport in the air and all thy face disclose  That paradise that speaks a heart divine  I yield thee full obedience  Thy prayers are all commands  Dry dry thy streaming eyes and on thy lips  Let tender smiles like harmless light'ning play  EVE  Ah misbelieving Adam  Be now a kind receiver  Of this delightful fruit  Hasten now hasten to extend thy hand  To press this banquet of beatitude  ADAM  O my most sweet companion  Behold thy ardent lover  Now banish from his heart  The whirlpool of affliction turn'd to him  His dearest guide his radiant polar star  Shew me that lovely apple  Which 'midst thy flow'rs and fruits  Ingenious plunderer thou hid'st from me  EVE  Adam behold the apple  What say'st thou I have tasted and yet live  Ah 'twill ensure our lives  And make us equal to our God in heav'n  But first the fruit entire  We must between us eat  And when we have enjoyed it  Then to a radiant throne a throne of stars  Exulting angels will direct our flight  ADAM  Give me the pilfer'd fruit  Thou courteous pilferer  Give me the fruit that charms thee  And let me yield to her  Who to make me a god has toiled and wept  Alas what have I done  How sharp a thorn is piercing in my heart  With instantaneous anguish  How am I overwhelm'd  In a vast flood of tears  EVE  Alas what do I see  Oh bitter knowledge unexpected sight  All is prepared for human misery  ADAM  O precious liberty where art thou fled  EVE  O precious liberty O dire enthralment  ADAM  Is this the fruit so sweet  The source of so much bitter  Say why would'st thou betray me  Ah why of heav'n deprive me  Why make me forfeit thus  My state of innocence  Where cheerful I enjoy a blissful life  Why make me thus a slave  To the fierce arms of death  Thou whom I deemed my life  EVE  I have been blind to good  Quick sighted but to evil  An enemy to Adam  A rebel to my God  For daring to exalt me  To the high gates of heav'n  I fall presumptuous to the depths of hell  ADAM  Alas what dart divine appears in heav'n  Blazing with circling flame  EVE  What punishment  Wretch that I am hangs o'er me Am I naked  And speaking still to Adam  ADAM  Am I too naked Shelter hence  EVE  I fly  Exeunt  ANALYSIS OF THE DRAMA ENTITLED  La Scena
