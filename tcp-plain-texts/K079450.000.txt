 THE FAREWELL  THE FAREWELL  P  FAREWELL to Europe and at once farewell  To all the follies which in Europe dwell  To Eastern India now a richer clime  Richer alas in ev'ry thing but Rime  The Muses steer their course and fond of change  At large in other Worlds desire to range  Resolv'd at least since They the fool must play  To do it in a diff'rent place and way  F  What whim is this what errour of the brain  What madness worse than in the dogstar's reign  Why into foreign countries would You roam  Are there not knaves and fools enough at home  If Satire be thy object and thy lays  As yet have shewn no talents fit for praise  If Satire be thy object search all round  Nor to thy purpose can one spot be found  Like England where to rampant vigour grown  Vice choaks up ev'ry Virtue where selfsown  The seeds of Folly shoot forth rank and bold  And ev'ry seed brings forth a hundred fold  P  No more of thistho' Truth the more our shame  The more our guilt tho' Truth perhaps may claim  And justify her part in this yet here  For the first time e'en Truth offends my ear  Declaim from morn to night from night to morn  Take up the theme anew when day's newborn  I hear and hatebe England what She will  With all her faults She is my Country still  F  Thy Country and what then Is that mere word  Against the voice of Reason to be heard  Are prejudices deep imbib'd in youth  To counteract and make thee hate the truth  'Tis the sure symptom of a narrow soul  To draw its grand attachment from the whole  And take up with a part Men not confin'd  Within such paltry limits Men design'd  Their nature to exalt where'er they go  Wherever waves can roll and winds can blow  Where'er the blessed Sun plac'd in the sky  To watch this subject world can dart his eye  Are still the same and prejudice outgrown  Consider ev'ry country as their own  At one grand view They take in Nature's plan  Not more at home in England than Japan  P  My good grave Sir of Theory whose wit  Grasping at shadows ne'er caught substance yet  'Tis mighty easy o'er a glass of wine  On vain refinements vainly to refine  To laugh at poverty in plenty's reign  To boast of Apathy when out of pain  And in each sentence worthy of the Schools  Varnish'd with sophistry to deal out rules  Most fit for practice but for one poor fault  That into practice they can ne'er be brought  At home and sitting in your elbowchair  You praise Japan tho' you was never there  But was the Ship this moment under sail  Would not your mind be chang'd your Spirits fail  Would you not cast one longing eye to shore  And vow to deal in such wild schemes no more  Howe'er our pride may tempt us to conceal  Those passions which we cannot chuse but feel  There's a strange Something which without a brain  Fools feel and with one wise men can't explain  Planted in Man to bind him to that earth  In dearest ties from whence he drew his birth  If Honour calls where'er She points the way  The Sons of Honour follow and obey  If Need compels wherever we are sent  'Tis want of courage not to be content  But if we have the liberty of choice  And all depends on our own single voice  To deem of ev'ry Country as the same  Is rank rebellion 'gainst the lawful claim  Of Nature and such dull indifference  May be PHILOSOPHY but can't be SENSE  F  Weak and unjust Distinction strange design  Most peevish most perverse to undermine  PHILOSOPHY and throw her empire down  By means of SENSE from whom she holds her crown  Divine PHILOSOPHY to Thee we owe  All that is worth possessing here below  Virtue and Wisdom consecrate thy reign  Doubled each joy and Pain no longer Pain  When like a Garden where for want of toil  And wholsome discipline the rich rank soil  Teems with incumbrances where all around  Herbs noxious in their nature make the Ground  Like the good Mother of a thankless Son  Curse her own womb by fruitfulness undone  Like such a garden when the human soul  Uncultur'd wild impatient of controul  Brings forth those passions of luxuriant race  Which spread and stifle ev'ry herb of grace  Whilst Virtue check'd by the cold hand of scorn  Seems with'ring on the bed where she was born  PHILOSOPHY steps in with steady hand  She brings her aid she clears th' encumber'd land  TOO virtuous to spare vice one stroke too wise  One moment to attend to Pity's cries  See with what Godlike what relentless pow'r  She roots up ev'ry weed  P and ev'ry flow'r  PHILOSOPHY a name of meek degree  Embrac'd in token of humility  By the proud Sage who whilst he strove to hide  In that vain artifice reveal'd his pride  PHILOSOPHY whom Nature had design'd  To purge all errours from the human mind  Herself misled by the Philosopher  At once her Priest and Master made us err  Pride Pride like leaven in a mass of flour  Tainted her laws and made e'en Virtue sowre  Had she content within her proper sphere  Taught lessons suited to the human ear  Which might fair Virtue's genuine fruits produce  Made not for ornament but real use  The heart of Man unrival'd she had sway'd  Prais'd by the good and by the bad obey'd  But when She overturning Reason's throne  Strove proudly in its place to plant her own  When She with Apathy the breast would steel  And teach us deeply feeling not to feel  When She would wildly all her force employ  Not to correct our passions but destroy  When not content our Nature to restore  As made by God She made it all new o'er  When with a strange and criminal excess  To make us more than Men she made us less  The Good her dwindled pow'r with pity saw  The Bad with joy and none but fools with awe  Truth with a simple and unvarnish'd tale  E'en from the mouth of Nmight prevail  Could She get there but Falshood's sugar'd strain  Should pour her fatal blandishments in vain  Nor make one convert tho' the Siren hung  Where she too often hangs on Mtongue  Should all the SOPHS whom in his course the Sun  Hath seen or past or present rise in One  Should He whilst pleasure in each sentence flows  Like PLATO give us Poetry in Prose  Should He full Orator at once impart  Th' ATHENIAN'S Genius with the ROMAN'S Art  Genius and Art should in this instance fail  Nor Rome tho' join'd with Athens here prevail  'Tis not in Man 'tis not in more than man  To make me find one fault in Nature's plan  Plac'd low ourselves we censure those above  And wanting judgment think that She wants love  Blame where we ought in reason to commend  And think her most a foe when most a friend  Such be PHILOSOPHERStheir specious art  Tho' Friendship pleads shall never warp my heart  Ne'er make me from this breast one passion tear  Which Nature my best friend hath planted there  F  Forgiving as a Friend what whilst I live  As a Philosopher I can't forgive  In this one point at last I join with You  To Nature pay all that is Nature's due  But let not clouded Reason sink so low  To fancy debts she does not cannot owe  Bear to full Manhood grown those shackles bear  Which Nature meant us for a time to wear  As we wear leadingstrings  Are laid aside when we can walk alone  But on thyself by peevish humour sway'd  Wilt Thou lay burdens Nature never laid  Wilt Thou make faults whilst Judgment weakly errs  And then defend mistaking them for her's  Dar'st Thou to say in our enlight'ned age  That this grand Master Passion this brave rage  Which flames out for thy country was imprest  And fix'd by Nature in the human breast  If you prefer the place where you was born  And hold all others in contempt and scorn  On fair Comparison If on that land  With lib'ral and a more than equal hand  Her gifts as in profusion Plenty sends  If Virtue meets with more and better friends  If Science finds a Patron 'mongst the great  If Honesty is Minister of State  If Pow'r the guardian of our rights design'd  Is to that great that only end confin'd  If Riches are employ'd to bless the poor  If Law is sacred Liberty secure  Let but these facts depend on proofs of weight  Reason declares thy Love can't be too great  And in this light could he our Country view  A very HOTTENTOT must love it too  But if by Fate's decrees you owe your birth  To some most barren and penurious earth  Where ev'ry comfort of this life denied  Her real wants are scantily supplied  Where Pow'r is Reason Liberty a Joke  Laws never made or made but to be broke  To fix thy love on such a wretched spot  Because in lust's wild fever there begot  Because thy weight no longer fit to bear  By chance not choice thy Mother dropt thee there  Is Folly which admits not of defence  It can't be Nature for it is not Sense  By the same argument which here you hold  When Falshood's insolent let Truth be bold  If Propagation can in torments dwell  A Devil must if born there love his hell  P  Had Fate to whose decrees I lowly bend  And e'en in punishment confess a friend  Ordain'd my birth in some place yet untried  On purpose made to mortify my pride  Where the Sun never gave one glimpse of day  Where Science never yet could dart one ray  Had I been born on some bleak blasted plain  Of barren Scotland in a STUART'S reign  Or in some kingdom where Men weak or worse  Turn'd Nature's ev'ry blessing to a curse  Where crowns of Freedom by the Fathers won  Dropp'd leaf by leaf from each degen'rate Son  In spite of all the wisdom you display  All you have said and yet may have to say  My weakness here if weakness I confess  I as my country had not lov'd her less  Whether strict Reason bears me out in this  Let those who always seeking always miss  The ways of Reason doubt with precious zeal  Their's be the praise to argue mine to feel  Wish we to trace this passion to the root  We like a tree may know it by its fruit  From its rich stem ten thousand virtues spring  Ten thousand blessings on its branches cling  Yet in the circle of revolving years  Not one misfortune not one vice appears  Hence then and what you Reason call adore  This if not Reason must be something more  But for I wish not others to confine  Be their opinions unrestrain'd as mine  Whether this Love's of good or evil growth  A Vice a Virtue or a spice of both  Let men of nicer argument decide  If it is virtuous sooth an honest pride  With lib'ral praise if vicious be content  It is a Vice I never can repent  A Vice which weigh'd in Heav'n shall more avail  Than ten cold virtues in the other scale  F  This wild untemper'd zeal which after all  We Candour unimpeach'd might madness call  Is it a Virtue that You scarce pretend  Or can it be a Vice like Virtue's friend  Which draws us off from and dissolves the force  Of private ties nay stops us in our course  To that grand object of the human soul  That nobler Love which comprehends the whole  Coop'd in the limits of this petty isle  This nook which scarce deserves a frown or smile  Weigh'd with Creation You by whim undone  Give all your thoughts to what is scarce worth one  The gen'rous Soul by Nature taught to soar  Her strength confirm'd in Philosophic lore  At one grand view takes in a world with ease  And seeing all mankind loves all she sees  P  Was it most sure which yet a doubt endures  Not found in Reason's Creed though found in your's  That these two services like what we're told  And know of God's and Mammon's cannot hold  And draw together that however loth  We neither serve attempting to serve both  I could not doubt a moment which to chuse  And which in common Reason to refuse  Invented oft for purposes of Art  Born of the head tho' father'd on the heart  This grand love of the world must be confest  A barren speculation at the best  Not one Man in a thousand should he live  Beyond the usual term of life could give  So rare Occasion comes and to so few  Proof whether his regards are feign'd or true  The Love we bear our Country is a root  Which never fails to bring forth golden fruit  'Tis in the mind an everlasting Spring  Of glorious actions which become a King  Nor less become a Subject 'tis a debt  Which bad Men tho' they pay not can't forget  A duty which the Good delight to pay  And ev'ry Man can practice ev'ry day  Nor for my life so very dim my eye  Or dull your argument can I descry  What you with faith assert how that dear love  Which binds me to my Country can remove  And make me of necessity forego  That gen'ral love which to the world I owe  Those ties of private nature small extent  In which the mind of narrow cast is pent  Are only steps on which the gen'rous soul  Mounts by degrees till She includes the whole  That spring of Love which in the human mind  Founded on self flows narrow and confin'd  Enlarges as it rolls and comprehends  The social Charities of blood and friends  Till smaller streams included not o'erpast  It rises to our Country's love at last  And He with lib'ral and enlarged mind  Who loves his Country cannot hate mankind  F  Friend as You would appear to Common Sense  Tell me or think no more of a defence  Is it a proof of love by choice to run  A vagrant from Your country  P  Can the Son  Shame Shame on all such sons with ruthless eye  And heart more patient than the flint stand by  And by some ruffian from all shame divorc'd  All Virtue see his honour'd Mother forc'd  Then no by Him that made me not e'en then  Could I with patience by the worst of Men  Behold my Country plunder'd beggar'd lost  Beyond Redemption all her glories cross'd  E'en when Occasion made them ripe her fame  Fled like a dream while She awakes to shame  F  Is it not more the office of a friend  The office of a Patron to defend  Her sinking state than basely to decline  So great a cause and in despair resign  P  Beyond my reach alas the grievance lies  And whilst more able Patriots doubt she dies  From a foul source more deep than we suppose  Fatally deep and dark this grievance flows  'Tis not that Peace our glorious hopes defeats  'Tis not the Voice of Faction in the streets  'Tis not a gross attack on Freedom made  'Tis not the arm of Privilege display'd  Against the Subject whilst She wears no sting  To disappoint the purpose of a King  These are no ills or trifles if compar'd  With those which are contriv'd tho' not declar'd  Tell me Philosopher is it a crime  To pry into the secret womb of Time  Or born in ignorance must we despair  To reach events and read the future there  Why be it sostill 'tis the right of Man  Imparted by his Maker where he can  To former times and men his eye to cast  And judge of what's to come by what is past  Should there be found in some not distant year  O how I wish to be no Prophet here  Amongst our British Lords should there be found  Some great in pow'r in principles unsound  Who look on Freedom with an evil eye  In whom the springs of Loyalty are dry  Who wish to soar on wild Ambition's wings  Who hate the Commons and who love not Kings  Who would divide the people and the throne  To set up sep'rate int'rests of their own  Who hate whatever aids their wholsome growth  And only join with to destroy them both  Should there be found such men in aftertimes  May Heav'n in mercy to our grievous crimes  Allot some milder vengeance nor to them  And to their rage this wretched land condemn  Thou God above on whom all States depend  Who knowest from the first their rise and end  If there's a day mark'd in the book of fate  When ruin must involve our equal state  When Law alas must be no more and we  To Freedom born must be no longer free  Let not a Mob of Tyrants seize the helm  Nor titled upstarts league to rob the realm  Let not whatever other ills assail  A damned ARISTOCRACY prevail  If all too short our course of Freedom run  'Tis thy good pleasure we should be undone  Let us some comfort in our griefs to bring  Be slaves to one and be that one a King  F  Poets accustom'd by their trade to feign  Oft substitute creations of the brain  For real substance and themselves deceiv'd  Would have the fiction by mankind believ'd  Such is your casebut grant to sooth your pride  That You know more than all the world beside  Why deal in hints why make a moment's doubt  Resolv'd and like a Man at once speak out  Shew us our danger tell us where it lies  And to ensure our safety make us wise  P  Rather than bear the pain of thought fools stray  The Proud will rather lose than ask their way  To men of Sense what needs it to unfold  And tell a tale which they must know untold  In the bad Int'rest warps the canker'd heart  The Good are hoodwink'd by the tricks of art  And whilst Arch subtle Hypocrites contrive  To keep the flames of discontent alive  Whilst They with arts to honest men unknown  Breed doubts between the People and the Throne  Making us fear where Reason never yet  Allow'd one fear or could one doubt admit  Themselves pass unsuspected in disguise  And 'gainst our real danger seal our eyes  F  Mark them and let their names recorded stand  On Shame's black roll and stink thro' all the land  P  That might some Courage but no Prudence be  No hurt to them and jeopardy to me  F  Leave out their names  P  For that kind caution thanks  But may not Judges sometimes fill up blanks  F  Your Country's laws in doubt then you reject  P  The Laws I love the Lawyers I suspect  Amongst twelve Judges may not One be found  On bare bare possibility I ground  This wholesome doubt who may Enlarge Retrench  Create and Uncreate and from the Bench  With winks smiles nods and such like paltry arts  May work and worm into a jury's hearts  Or baffled there may turbulent of soul  Cramp their high office and their rights controul  Who may tho' Judge turn Advocate at large  And deal replies out by the way of charge  Making Interpretation all the way  In spite of Facts his wicked will obey  And leaving Law without the least defence  May damn his Conscience to approve his Sense  F  Whilst the true guardians of this charter'd land  In full and perfect vigour Juries stand  A Judge in vain shall awe cajole perplex  P  Suppose I should be tried in MIDDLESEX  F  To pack a Jury they will never dare  P  There's no occasion to pack Juries there  F  'Gainst Prejudice all arguments are weak  Reason herself without effect must speak  Fly then thy Country like a Coward fly  Renounce her int'rest and her laws defy  But why bewitch'd to India turn thy eyes  Cannot our Europe thy vast wrath suffice  Cannot thy misbegotten Muse lay bare  Her brawny arm and play the Butcher there  P  Thy Counsel taken what should Satire do  Where could she find an object that is new  Those travell'd Youths whom tender Mothers wean  And send abroad to see and to be seen  With whom least they should fornicate or worse  A Tutor's sent by way of a dry nurse  Each of whom just enough of Spirit bears  To shew our follies and to bring home their's  Have made all Europe's vices so well known  They seem almost as nat'ral as our own  F  Will India for thy purpose better do  P  In one respect at leastthere's something New  F  A harmless People in whom Nature speaks  Free and untainted 'mongst whom Satire seeks  But vainly seeks so simply plain their hearts  One bosom where to lodge her poison'd darts  P  From knowledge speak You this or doubt on doubt  Weigh'd and resolv'd hath Reason found it out  Neither from knowledge nor by Reason taught  You have Faith ev'ry where but where You ought  India or EuropeWhat's there in a name  Propensity to vice in both the same  Nature alike in both works for Man's good  Alike in both by Man himself withstood  Nabobs as well as those who hunt them down  Deserve a cord much better than a crown  And a Mogul can thrones as much debase  As any polish'd Prince of Christian race  F  Could You a task more hard than You suppose  Could You in ridicule whilst Satire glows  Make all their follies to the life appear  'Tis ten to one You gain no credit here  Howe'er welldrawn the Picture after all  Because we know not the Original  Would not find favour in the public eye  P  That having your good leave I mean to try  And if Your observations sterling hold  If the Piece should be heavy tame and cold  To make it to the side of Nature lean  And meaning nothing something seem to mean  To make the whole in lively colours glow  To bring before us something that we know  And from all honest men applause to win  I'll groupe the Company and put them in  F  Be that ungen'rous thought by shame suppress'd  Add not distress to those too much distress'd  Have They not by blind Zeal misled laid bare  Those sores which never might endure the air  Have They not brought their mysteries so low  That what the Wise suspected not Fools know  From their first rise e'en to the present hour  Have They not prov'd their own abuse of pow'r  Made it impossible if fairly view'd  Ever to have that dang'rous pow'r renew'd  Whilst unseduc'd by Ministers the throne  Regards our Interests and knows its own  P  Should ev'ry other subject chance to fail  Those who have sail'd and those who wish'd to sail  In the last Fleet afford an ample field  Which must beyond my hopes a harvest yield  F  On such vile food Satire can never thrive  P  She cannot starve if there was only CLIVE  THE END
