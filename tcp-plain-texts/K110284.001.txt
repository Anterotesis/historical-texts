 PREFACE  A GREAT part of the Poetical Works of Mr Shenstone particularly his Elegies and Pastorals are as he himself expresses it  "The exact transcripts of the situation of his own mind"  and abound in frequent allusions to his own place the beautiful scene of his retirement from the world Exclusively therefore of our natural curiosity to be acquainted with the history of an author whose Works we peruse with pleasure some short account of Mr Shenstone's personal character and situation in life may not only be agreeable but absolutely necessary to the reader as it is impossible he should enter into the true spirit of his writings if he is entirely ignorant of those circumstances of his life which sometimes so greatly influenced his reflections  I could wish however that this task had been allotted to some person capable of performing it in that masterly manner which the subject so well deserves To confess the truth it was chiefly to prevent his Remains from falling into the hands of any one still less qualified to do him justice that I have unwillingly ventured to undertake the publication of them myself  Mr Shenstone was the eldest son of a plain uneducated gentleman in Shropshire who farmed his own estate The father sensible of his son's extraordinary capacity resolved to give him a learned education  and sent him a commoner to Pembroke College in Oxford designing him for the church but though he had the most awful notions of the wisdom power and goodness of God he never could be persuaded to enter into orders In his private opinions he adhered to no particular sect and hated all religious disputes But whatever were his own sentiments he always shewed great tenderness to those who differed from him Tenderness indeed in every sense of the word was his peculiar characteristic his friends his domestics his poor neighbours all daily experienced his benevolent turn of mind Indeed this virtue in him was often carried to such excess that it sometimes bordered upon weakness yet if he was convinced that any of those ranked amongst the number of his friends had treated him ungenerously he was not easily reconciled He used a maxim however on such occasions which is worthy of being observed and imitated  "I never"  said he  "will be a revengeful enemy but I cannot it is not in my nature to be half a friend"  He was in his temper quite unsuspicious but if suspicion was once awakened in him it was not laid asleep again without difficulty  He was no economist the generosity of his temper prevented him from paying a proper regard to the use of money he exceeded therefore the bounds of his paternal fortune which before he died was considerably incumbered But when one recollects the perfect  paradise he had raised around him the hospitality with which he lived his great indulgence to his servants his charities to the indigent and all done with an estate not more than three hundred pounds ayear one should rather be led to wonder that he left any thing behind him than to blame his want of economy He left however more than sufficient to pay all his debts and by his will appropriated his whole estate for that purpose  It was perhaps from some considerations on the narrowness of his fortune that he forbore to marry for he was no enemy to wedlock had a high opinion of many among the fair sex was fond of their society and no stranger to the tenderest impressions One which he received in his youth was with difficulty surmounted The lady was the subject of that sweet pastoral in four parts which has been so universally admired and which one would have thought must have subdued the loftiest heart and softened the most obdurate  His person as to height was above the middle stature but largely and rather inelegantly formed his face seemed plain till you conversed with him and then it grew very pleasing In his dress he was negligent even to a fault though when young at the university he was accounted a beau He wore his own hair which was quite gray very early in a particular manner not from any affectation of singularity but from a maxim he had laid down that without too  slavish a regard to fashion every one should dress in a manner most suitable to his own person and figure In short his faults were only little blemishes thrown in by Nature as it were on purpose to prevent him from rising too much above that level of imperfection allotted to humanity  His character as a writer will be distinguished by simplicity with elegance and genius with correctness He had a sublimity equal to the highest attempts yet from the indolence of his temper he chose rather to amuse himself in culling flowers at the foot of the mount than to take the trouble of climbing the more arduous steeps of Parnassus but whenever he was disposed to rise his steps though natural were noble and always well supported In the tenderness of Elegiac poetry he hath not been excelled in the simplicity of Pastoral one may venture to say he had very few equals Of great sensibility himself he never failed to engage the hearts of his readers and amidst the nicest attention to the harmony of his numbers he always took care to express with propriety the sentiments of an elegant mind In all his writings his greatest difficulty was to please himself I remember a passage in one of his Letters where speaking of his Love Songs he says  "Some were written on occasions a good deal imaginary others not so and the reason there are so many is that I wanted to write one good song and could never please myself"  It was this diffidence which occasioned him  to throw aside many of his pieces before he had bestowed upon them his last touches I have suppressed several on this account and if among those which I have selected there should be discovered some little want of his finishing polish I hope it will be attributed to this cause and of course be excused yet I flatter myself there will always appear something well worthy of having been preserved and though I was afraid of inserting what might injure the character of my friend yet as the sketches of a great master are always valuable I was unwilling the public should lose any thing material of so accomplished a writer In this dilemma it will easily be conceived that the task I had to perform would become somewhat difficult how I have acquitted myself the public must judge Nothing however except what he had already published has been admitted without the advice of his most judicious friends nothing altered without their particular concurrence It is impossible to please every one but 'tis hoped that no reader will be so unreasonable as to imagine that the Author wrote solely for his amusement his talents were various and though it may perhaps be allowed that his excellence chiefly appeared in subjects of tenderness and simplicity yet he frequently condescended to trifle with those of humour and drollery these indeed he himself in some measure degraded by the title which he gave them of Levities but had they been entirely rejected the public would have been deprived  of some  jeux d'esprits  excellent in their kind and Mr Shenstone's character as a writer would have been but imperfectly exhibited  But the talents of Mr Shenstone were not confined merely to poetry his character as a man of clear judgment and deep penetration will best appear from his Prose Works it is there we must search for the acuteness of his understanding and his profound knowledge of the human heart It is to be lamented indeed that some things here are unfinished and can be regarded only as fragments many are left as single thoughts but which like the sparks of diamonds shew the richness of the mine to which they belong or like the foot of a Hercules discover the uncommon strength and extraordinary dimensions of that hero I have no apprehension of incurring blame from any one for preserving these valuable Remains they will discover to every reader the Author's sentiments on several important subjects and there can be very few to whom they will not impart many thoughts which they would never perhaps have been able to draw from the source of their own reflections  But I believe little need be said to recommend the writings of this gentleman to public attention His character is already sufficiently established and if he be not injured by the inability of his editor there is no doubt but he will ever maintain an eminent station among the best of our English writers  R DODSLEY  A PREFATORY ESSAY ON ELEGY  IT is observable that discourses prefixed to poetry are contrived very frequently to inculcate such tenets as may exhibit the performance to the greatest advantage the fabric is very commonly raised in the first place and the measures by which we are to judge of its merit are afterwards adjusted  There have been few rules given us by the critics concerning the structure of Elegiac poetry and far be it from the author of the following trifles to dignify his own opinions with that denomination he would only intimate the great variety of subjects and the different styles  This essay was written near twenty years ago  in which the writers of Elegy have hitherto indulged themselves and endeavour to shield the following ones by the latitude of their example  If we consider the etymology of the word  ελεγειν εparticulam dolendi  the epithet which Horace gives it  Miserabiles elegos  Hor  or the confession which Ovid makes concerning it  Heu nimis ex vero nunc tibi nomen erit  Ovid  de Morte Tibulli  I think we may conclude thus much however that Elegy in its true and genuine acceptation includes a tender and querulous idea that it looks upon this as its peculiar characteristic and so long as this is thoroughly sustained admits of a variety of subjects which by its  manner of treating them it renders its own it throws its melancholystole over pretty differentobjects which like the dresses at a funeral procession gives them all a kind of solemn and uniform appearance  It is probable that Elegies were written at first upon the death of intimate friends and near relations celebrated beauties or favourite mistresses beneficent governors and illustrious men one may add perhaps of all those who are placed by Virgil in the laurel grove of his Elysium  Vide  Hurd's Dissertation on Horace's Epistle  Quique sui memores alios secere merendo  After these subjects were sufficiently exhausted and the severity of fate displayed in the most affecting instances the poets sought occasion to vary their complaints and the next tender species of sorrow that presented itself was the grief of absent or neglected lovers and this indulgence might be indeed allowed them but with this they were not contented they had obtained a small corner in the province of love and they took advantage from thence to overrun the whole territory they sung its spoils triumphs ovations and rejoicings  Dicite Io Paean et Io bis dicite Paean  Ovid  as well as the captivity and exequies that attended it they gave the name of Elegy to their pleasantries as well as lamentations till at last through their abundant fondness for the myrtle they forgot that the cypress was their peculiar garland  In this it is probable they deviated from the original design of Elegy and it should seem that any kind of subjects treated in such a manner as to diffuse a pleasing melancholy might far better deserve the name than the facetious mirth and libertine festivity of the successful votaries of Love  But not to dwell too long upon an opinion which may seem perhaps introduced to favour the following performance it may not be improper to examine into the use and end of Elegy The most important end of all poetry is to encourage virtue Epic and tragedy chiefly recommend the public virtues Elegy is of a species which illustrates and endears the private There is a truly virtuous pleasure connected with many pensive contemplations which it is the province and excellency of Elegy to enforce this by presenting suitable ideas has discovered sweets in melancholy which we could not find in mirth and has led us with success to the dusty urn when we could draw no pleasure from the sparkling bowl As Pastoral conveys an idea of simplicity and innocence it is in particular the task and merit of Elegy to shew the innocence and simplicity of rural life to advantage and that in a way distinct from Pastoral as much as the plain but judicious landlord may be imagined to surpass his tenant both in dignity and understanding It should also tend to elevate the more tranquil virtues of humility disinterestedness simplicity and innocence  but then there is a degree of elegance and refinement no way inconsistent with these rural virtues and that raises Elegy above that  merum rus  that unpolished rusticity which has given our Pastoral writers their highest reputation  Wealth and splendor will never want their proper weight the danger is lest they should too much preponderate a kind of poetry therefore which throws its chief influence into the otherscale that magnifies the sweets of liberty and independence that endears the honest delights of love and friendship that celebrates the glory of a good name after death that ridicules the futile arrogance of birth that recommends the innocent amusement of letters and insensibly prepares the mind for that humanity it inculcates such a kind of poetry may chance to please and if it please should seem to be of service  As to the style of Elegy it may be well enough determined from what has gone before it should imitate the voice and language of grief or if a metaphor of dress be more agreeable it should be simple and diffuse and flowing as a mourner's veil A versification therefore is desirable which by indulging a free and unconstrained expression may admit of that simplicity which Elegy requires  Heroic metre with alternate rhyme seems well enough adapted to this species of poetry and however exceptionable upon other occasions its inconveniencies  appear to lose their weight in shorter Elegies and its advantages seem to acquire an additional importance The world has an admirable example of its beauty in a collection of Elegies  NB  This preface was written near twenty years ago  not long since published the product of a gentleman of the most exact taste and whose untimely death merits all the tears that Elegy can shed  It is not impossible that some may think this metre too lax and prosaic others that even a more dissolute variety of numbers may have superior advantages and in favour of these last might be produced the example of Milton in his Lycidas together with one or two recent and beautiful imitations of his versification in that monody But this kind of argument I am apt to think must prove too much since the writers I have in view seem capable enough of recommending any metre they shall chuse though it must be owned also that the choice they make of any is at the same time the strongest presumption in its favour  Perhaps it may be no great difficulty to compromise the dispute There is no one kind of metre that is distinguished by rhymes but is liable to some objection or other Heroic verse where every second line is terminated by a rhyme with which the judgment requires that the sense should in some measure also terminate is apt to render the expression either scanty or constrained and this is sometimes observable  in the writings of a poet lately deceased though I believe no one ever threw so much sense together with so much ease into a couplet as Mr Pope but as an air of constraint too often accompanies this metre it seems by no means proper for a writer of Elegy  The previous rhyme in Milton's Lycidas is very frequently placed at such a distance from the following that it is often dropt by the memory much better employed in attending to the sentiment before it be brought to join its partner and this seems to be the greatest objection to that kind of versification but then the peculiar ease and variety it admits of are no doubt sufficient to overbalance the objection and to give it the preference to any other in an Elegy of length  The chief exception to which stanza of all kinds is liable is that it breaks the sense too regularly when it is continued through a long poem and this may be perhaps the fault of Mr Waller's excellent panegyric But if this fault be less discernible in smaller compositions as I suppose it is I flatter myself that the advantages I have before mentioned resulting from alternate rhyme with which stanza is I think connected may at least in shorter Elegies be allowed to outweigh its imperfections  I shall say but little of the different kinds of Elegy The melancholy of a lover is different no doubt from what we feel on other mixed occasions The mind in  which love and grief at once predominate is softened to an excess Loveelegy therefore is more negligent of order and design and being addressed chiefly to the ladies requires little more than tenderness and perspicuity Elegies that are formed upon promiscuous incidents and addressed to the world in general inculcate some sort of moral and admit a different degree of reasoning thought and order  The Author of the following Elegies entered on his subjects occasionally as particular incidents in life suggested or dispositions of mind recommended them to his choice If he describes a rural landscape or unfolds the train of sentiments it inspired he fairly drew his picture from the spot and felt very sensibly the affection he communicates if he speaks of his humble shed his flocks and his fleeces he does not counterfeit the scene who having whether thro' choice or necessity is not material retired betimes to country solitudes and sought his happiness in rural employments has a right to consider himself as a real shepherd The flocks the meadows and the grottos are his own and the embellishment of his farm his sole amusement As the sentiments therefore were inspired by Nature and that in the earlier part of his life he hopes they will retain a natural appearance diffusing at least some part of that amusement which he freely acknowledges he received from the composition of them  There will appear perhaps a real inconsistency in the moral tenour of the several Elegies and the subsequent ones may sometimes seem a recantation of the preceding The reader will scarcely impute this to oversight but will allow that men's opinions as well as tempers vary that neither public nor private active nor speculative life are unexceptionably happy and consequently that any change of opinion concerning them may afford an additional beauty to poetry as it gives us a more striking representation of life  If the Author has hazarded throughout the use of English or modern allusions he hopes it will not be imputed to an entire ignorance or to the least disesteem of the ancient learning He has kept the ancient plan and method in his eye though he builds his edifice with the materials of his own nation In other words through a fondness for his native country he has made use of the flowers it produced tho' in order to exhibit them to the greater advantage he has endeavoured to weave his garland by the best model he could find with what success beyond his own amusement must be left to judges less partial to him than either his acquaintance or his friendsIf any of those should be so candid as to approve the variety of subjects he has chosen and the tenderness of sentiment he has endeavoured to impress he begs the metre also may not be too suddenly condemned The  public ear habituated of late to a quicker measure may perhaps consider this as heavy and languid but an objection of that kind may gradually lose its force if this measure should be allowed to suit the nature of Elegy  If it should happen to be considered as an objection with others that there is too much of a moral cast dissused through the whole it is replied that he endeavoured to animate the poetry so far as not to render this objection too obvious or to risk excluding the fashionable reader at the same time never deviating from a fixed principle that poetry without morality is but the blossom of a fruittree Poetry is indeed like that species of plants which may bear at once both fruits and blossoms and the tree is by no means in perfection without the former however it may be embellished by the flowers which surround it  ADVERTISEMENT  TO THE READER  TO this edition is subjoined for the sake of those readers to whom it may not prove unwelcome an explanation or rather in most places a liberal imitation of all the Latin inscriptions and quotations throughout this Work by Mr Hull That gentleman's wellknown friendship for Mr Shenstone and willingness to oblige being his sole inducements to this as he chuses to have it call'd trifling addition the editor thinks it no more than a just return of gratitude to let his purchasers know to whom they are beholden for it Be it remembered however that it was executed in a country retirement where our eminent translators of the Classics were not at hand to be consulted  A DESCRIPTION OF THE LEASOWES  The following Description was intended to give a friend some idea of the Leasoweswhich having been so justly admired by persons of the best taste and celebrated by the Muse of such an original genius as Mr Shenstone it is hoped the public will not be displeased with this slight attempt to perpetuate those beauties which time or the different taste of some future possessor may destroy  The seat of the late William Shenstone Esq  BY R DODSLEY  THE Leasowes is situate in the parish of Hales Owen a small markettown in the county of Salop but surrounded by other counties and thirty miles from Shrewsbury as it is near ten to the borders of Shropshire Though a paternal estate it was never distinguished for any peculiar beauties till the time of its late owner It was reserved for a person of his ingenuity both to discover and improve them which he has done so effectually that it is now considered as amongst the principal of those delightful scenes which persons of taste in the present age are desirous to see Far from violating its natural beauties Mr Shenstone's only study was to give them their full effect and although the form in which things now  appear be indeed the consequence of much thought and labour yet the hand of Art is no way visible either in the shape of ground the disposition of trees or which are here so numerous and striking the romantic fall of his cascades  But I will now proceed to a more particular description About half a mile short of Hales Owen in your way from Birmingham to Bewdley you quit the great road and turn into a green lane on the left hand where descending in a winding manner to the bottom of a deep valley finely shaded the first object that occurs is a kind of ruinated wall and a small gate within an arch inscribed  "The Priory Gate"  Here it seems the company should properly begin their walk but generally chuse to go up with their horses or equipage to the house from whence returning they descend back into the valley Passing through a small gate at the bottom of the fine swelling lawn that surrounds the house you enter upon a winding path with a piece of water on your right The path and water overshadowed with trees that grow upon the slopes of this narrow dingle render the scene at once cool gloomy solemn and sequestered and form so striking a contrast to the lively scene you have just left that you seem all on a sudden landed in a subterraneous kind of region Winding forward down the valley you pass beside a small roothouse where on a tablet are these lines  " Here in cool grot and mossy cell  " We rural Fays and Faeries dwell  " Tho' rarely seen by mortal eye  " When the pale moon ascending high  " Darts thro' yon' limes her quiv'ring beams  " We frisk it near these crystal streams  " Her beams reflected from the wave  " Afford the light our revels crave  " The turf with daisies broider'd o'er  " Exceeds we wot the Parian floor  " Nor yet for artful strains we call  " But listen to the water's fall  " Would you then taste our tranquil scene  " Be sure your bosoms be serene  " Devoid of hate devoid of strife  " Devoid of all that poisons life  " And much it 'vails you in their place  " To graft the love of human race  " And tread with awe these favour'd bowers  " Nor wound the shrubs nor bruise the flowers  " So may your path with sweets abound  " So may your couch with rest be crown'd  " But harm betide the wayward swain  " Who dares our hallow'd haunts profane"  These sentiments correspond as well as possible with the ideas we form of the abode of Fairies and appearing deep in this romantic valley serve to keep alive such enthusiastic images while this sort of scene continues  You now pass through The Priory Gate before mentioned and are admitted into a part of the valley somewhat different from the former tall trees high irregular ground and rugged scars The right presents you with perhaps the most natural if not the most striking of the many cascades here found  the left with a sloping grove of oaks and the centre with a pretty circular landscape appearing through the trees of which Hales Owen steeple and other objects at a distance form an interesting part The seat beneath the ruinated wall has these lines of Virgil inscribed suiting well with the general tenour of Mr Shenstone's late situation  " Lucis habitamus opacis  " Riparumque toros et prata recentia rivis  " Incolimus  IMITATION  We dwell in shady groves  And seek the groves with cooling streams refresh'd  And trace the verdant banks  "  You now proceed a few paces down the valley to another bench where you have this cascade in front which together with the internal arch and other appendages make a pretty irregular picture I must observe once for all that a number of these protempore benches two stumps with a transverse board seem chiefly intended as hints to spectators lest in passing cursorily through the farm they might suffer any of that immense variety the place furnishes to escape their notice The stream attending us with its agreeable murmurs as we descend along this pleasing valley we come next to a small seat where we have a sloping grove upon the right and on the left a striking vista to the steeple of Hales Owen  which is here seen in a new light We now descend farther down this shady and sequestered valley accompanied on the right by the same brawling rivulet running over pebbles till it empties itself into a fine piece of water at the bottom The path here winding to the left conforms to the water before mentioned running round the foot of a small hill and accompanying this semicircular lake into another winding valley somewhat more open and not less pleasing than the former however before we enter this it will be proper to mention a seat about the centre of this waterscene where the ends of it are lost in the two vallies on each side and in front it is invisibly connected with another piece of water of about twenty acres open to Mr Shenstone but not his property This last was a performance of the monks and part of a prodigious chain of fishponds that belonged to Hales Abbey The back ground of this scene is very beautiful and exhibits a picture of villages and varied ground finely held up to the eye  I speak of all this as already finished but through some misfortune in the mound that pounds up the water it is not completed  We now leave The Priory upon the left which is not meant for an object here and wind along into the other valley and here I cannot but take notice of the judgment which formed this piece of water for although it be not very large yet as it is formed  by the concurrence of three vallies in which two of the ends are hid and in the third it seems to join with the large extent of water below it is to all appearance unbounded I must confess I never saw a more natural bed for water or any kind of lake that pleased me better but it may be right to mention that this water in its full extent has a yet more important effect from Mr Shenstone's house where it is seen to a great advantage We now by a pleasing serpentine walk enter a narrow glade in the valley the slopes on each side finely covered with oaks and beeches on the left of which is a common bench which affords a retiring place secluded from every eye and a short respite during which the eye reposes on a fine amphitheatre of wood and thicket  We now proceed to a seat beneath a prodigiously fine canopy of spreading oak on the back of which is this inscription  " Huc ades O Meliboee caper tibi salvus et hoedi  " Et si quid cessare potes requiesce sub umbra  IMITATION  Hither O Meliboeus bend thy way  Thy herds thy goats secure from harm repose  If happy leisure serve a while to stay  Here rest thy limbs beneath these shady boughs  "  The picture before it is that of a beautiful homescene a small lawn of wellvaried ground encompassed with hills and wellgrown oaks and embellished with a cast of the piping Faunus amid trees  and shrubs on a slope upon the left and on the right and nearer the eye with an urn thus inscribed  " Ingenio et amicitiae  " Gvlielmi Somerville"  And on the opposite side  " G S posvit  " Debita spargens lacrima favillam  " Vatis amici  TRANSLATION  To the genius and friendship  of  WILLIAM SOMERVILLE  By W S  Sprinkling the ashes of a friendly bard  With tributary tears  "  The scene is inclosed on all sides by trees in the middle only there is an opening where the lawn is continued and winds out of sight  Here entering a gate you are led through a thicket of many sorts of willows into a large roothouse inscribed to the Right Honourable the Earl of Stamford It seems that worthy peer was present at the first opening of the cascade which is the principal object from the roothouse where the eye is presented with a fairy vision consisting of an irregular and romantic fall of water very unusual one hundred and fifty yards in continuity and a very striking scene it affords Other cascades may possibly have the advantage of a greater descent and a larger torrent but a more wild and romantic appearance of water and at the same time strictly natural is what  I never saw in any place whatever This scene tho' comparatively small is yet aggrandized with so much art that we forget the quantity of water which flows through this close and overshaded valley and are so much transported with the intricacy of scene and the concealed height from whence it flows that we without reflection add the idea of magnificence to that of beauty In short it is not but upon reflection that we find the stream is not a Niagara but rather a waterfall in miniature and that the same artifice upon a larger scale were there large trees instead of small ones and a river instead of a rill would be capable of forming a scene that would exceed the utmost of our ideas But I will not dwell longer upon this inimitable scene those who would admire it properly must view it as surely as those that view it must admire it beyond almost any thing they ever saw  Proceeding on the righthand path the next seat affords a scene of what Mr Shenstone used to call his Forest ground consisting of wild green slopes peeping through dingle or irregular groupes of trees a confused mixture of savage and cultivated ground held up to the eye and forming a landscape fit for the pencil of Salvator Rosa  Winding on beside this lawn which is overarched with spreading trees the eye catches at intervals over an intermediate hill the spire of Hales church  forming here a perfect obeliskthe urn to Mr Somerville c and now passing through a kind of thicket we arrive at a natural bower of almost circular oaks inscribed in the manner following  " To Mr DODSLEY  " Come then my Friend thy sylvan taste display  " Come hear thy Faunus tune his rustic lay  " Ah rather come and in these dells disown  " The care of other strains and tune thine own"  On the bank above it amid the forementioned shrubs is a statue of the piping Faun which not only embellishes this scene but is also seen from the court before the house and from other places it is surrounded by venerable oaks and very happily situated From this bower also you look down upon the forementioned irregular ground shut up with trees on all sides except some few openings to the more pleasing parts of this grotesque and hilly country The next little bench affords the first but not most striking view of The Priory It is indeed a small building but seen as it is beneath trees and its extremity also hid by the same it has in some sort the dignity and solemn appearance of a larger edifice  Passing through a gate we enter a small open grove where the first seat we find affords a picturesque view through trees of a clump of oaks at a distance overshadowing a little cottage upon a green hill we thence immediately enter a perfect dome or circular temple of magnificent beeches in the centre of which it was  intended to place an antique altar or a statue of Pan The path serpentizing through this open grove leads us by an easy ascent to a small bench with this motto  " Me gelidum nemus  " Nympharumque leves cum satyris chori  " Secernant populo  EXPLANATION  May the cool grove  And gay assembled nymphs with sylvans mix'd  Conceal me from the world  "  HOR  which alludes to the retired situation of the grove There is also seen through an opening to the left a pleasing landscape of a distant hill with a whited farmhouse upon the summit and to the right hand a beautiful round slope crowned with a clump of large firs with a pyramidal seat on its centre to which after no long walk the path conduct us  But we first come to another view of The Priory more advantageous and at a better distance to which the eye is led down a green slope through a scenery of tall oaks in a most agreeable manner the grove we have just passed on one side and a hill of trees and thicket on the other conducting the eye to a narrow opening through which it appears  We now ascend to a small bench where the circumjacent country begins to open in particular a glasshouse appears between two large clumps of trees at about the distance of four miles the glasshouses in this country not ill resembling a distant pyramid  Ascending to the next seat which is in the Gothic form the scene grows more and more extended woods and lawns hills and vallies thicket and plain agreeably intermingled On the back of this seat is the following inscription which the Author told me that he chose to fix here to supply what he thought some want of life in this part of the farm and to keep up the spectator's attention till he came to scale the hill beyond  INSCRIPTION  ' Shepherd wouldst thou here obtain  ' Pleasure unalloy'd with pain  ' Joy that suits the rural sphere  ' Gentle Shepherd lend an ear  ' Learn to relish calm delight  ' Verdant vales and fountains bright  ' Trees that nod on sloping hills  ' Caves that echo tinkling rills  ' If thou canst no charm disclose  ' In the simplest bud that blows  ' Go forsake thy plain and fold  ' Join the crowd and toil for gold  ' Tranquil pleasures never cloy  ' Banish each tumultuous joy  ' All but lovefor love inspires  ' Fonder wishes warmer fires  ' Love and all its joys be thine  ' Yet ere thou the reins resign  ' Hear what Reason seems to say  ' Hear attentive and obey  " Crimson leaves the rose adorn  " But beneath them lurks a thorn  " Fair and flow'ry is the brake  " Yet it hides the 'vengeful snake  " Think not she whose empty pride  " Dares the fleecy garb deride  " Think not she who light and vain  " Scorns the sheep can love the swain  " Artless deed and simple

to sigh  " If her kid or lambkin die  " Let not lucre let not pride  " Draw thee from such charms aside  " Have not those their proper sphere  " Gentler passions triumph here  " See to sweeten thy repose  " The blossom buds the fountain flows  " Lo to crown thy healthful board  " All that milk and fruits afford  " Seek no morethe rest is vain  " Pleasure ending soon in pain  " Anguish lightly gilded o'er  " Close thy wish and seek no more"  And now passing through a wicket the path winds up the back part of a circular green hill discovering little of the country till you enter a clump of stately firs upon the summit Overarched by these firs is an octagonal seat the back of which is so contrived as to form a table or pedestal for a bowl or goblet thus inscribed  " To all friends round The Wrekin"  This facetious inscription being an old Shropshire health is a commemoration of his country friends  from which this part of Shropshire is divided add to this that The Wrekin that large and venerable hill appears full in front at the distance of about thirty miles  The scene is a very fine one divided by the firs into several compartments each answering to the octagonal seat in the centre to each of which is allotted a competent number of striking objects to make a complete picture A long serpentine stream washes the foot of this hill and is lost behind trees at one end and a bridge thrown over at the other Over this the eye is carried from very romantic homescenes to very beautiful ones at a distance It is impossible to give an idea of that immense variety that fine configuration of parts which engage our attention from this place In one of the compartments you have a simple scene of a cottage and a road winding behind a farmhouse half covered with trees upon the top of some wild sloping ground and in another a view of the town appearing from hence as upon the shelving banks of a large piece of water in the flat Suffice it to say that the hill and vale plain and woodland villages and single houses blue distant mountains that skirt the horizon and green hills romantically jumbled that form the intermediate ground make this spot more than commonly strikingnor is there to be seen an acre of level ground through the large extent to which the eye is carried  Hence the path winds on betwixt two small benches each of which exhibits a pleasing landscape which cannot escape the eye of a connoisseur  Here we wind through a small thicket and soon enter a cavity in the hill filled with trees in the centre of which is a seat from whence is discovered gleaming across the trees a considerable length of the serpentine stream before mentioned running under a slight rustic bridge to the right hence we ascend in a kind of Gothic alcove looking down a slope sided with large oaks and tall beeches which together overarch the scene On the back of this building is found the following  INSCRIPTION  " O you that bathe in courtlye blysse  " Or toyle in Fortune's giddy spheare  " Do not too rashlye deeme amysse  " Of him that bydes contented here  " Nor yet disdeigne the russet stoale  " Which o'er each carelesse lymbe he flyngs  " Nor yet deryde the beechen bowle  " In whyche he quaffs the lympid springs  " Forgive him if at eve or dawne  " Devoide of worldlye cark he stray  " Or all beside some flowerye lawne  " He waste his inoffensive daye  " So may he pardonne fraud and strife  " If such in courtlye haunt he see  " For faults there beene in busye life  " From whyche these peaceful glennes are free"  Below this alcove is a large sloping lawn finely bounded crossed by the serpentine water before mentioned  and interspersed with single or clumps of oaks at agreeable distances Further on the scene is finely varied the hills rising and falling towards the opposite concavities by the side of a long winding vale with the most graceful confusion Among other scenes that form this landscape a fine hanging wood backed and contrasted with a wild heath intersected with cross roads is a very considerable object Near adjoining to this is a seat from whence the water is seen to advantage in many different stages of its progress or where as a poetical friend once observed the proprietor has taken the Naiad by the hand and led her an irregular dance into the valley  Proceeding hence through a wicket we enter upon another lawn beyond which is a new theatre of wild shaggy precipices hanging coppice ground and smooth round hills between being not only different but even of an opposite character to the ground from which we passed Walking along the head of this lawn we come to a seat under a spreading beech with this  INSCRIPTION  " Hoc erat in votis modus agri non ita magnus  " Hortus ubi et tecto vicinus jugis aquae fons  " Et paulum sylvae super his foret Auctius atque  " Dii melius fecere"  IMITATION  This was my wishan humble spot of ground  A garden welldispos'd and fenc'd around  A bubbling fountain to my dwelling nigh  With crystal treasures stor'd and never dry  The whole defended by a modest wood  This was my wishmy wish the gods allow'd  And ev'n beyond that wish indulgently bestow'd  In the centre of the hanging lawn before you is discovered the house half hid with trees and bushes a little hanging wood and a piece of winding water issues through a noble clump of large oaks and spreading beeches At the distance of about ten or twelve miles Lord Stamford's grounds appear and beyond these the Clee hills in Shropshire The scene here consists of admirablyvaried ground and is I think a very fine one Hence passing still along the top of the lawn we cross another gate and behind the fence being to descend into the valley About half way down is a small bench which throws the eye upon a near scene of hanging woods and shaggy wild declivities intermixed with smooth green slopes and scenes of cultivation  We now return again into the great lawn at bottom and soon come to a seat which gives a nearer view of the water before mentioned between the trunks of high overshadowing oaks and beeches beyond which the winding line of trees is continued down the valley to the right To the left at a distance the top of Clent hill appears and the house upon a swell amidst trees and bushes In the centre the eye is carried by a sideling view down a length of  lawn till it rests upon the town and spire of Hales with some picturesque and beautiful ground rising behind it  Somewhat out of the path and in the centre of a noble clump of stately beeches is a seat inscribed to Mr Spence in these words  IOSEPHO SPENCE  eximio nostro Critoni  cvi dicari vellet  Mvsarvm omnivm et Gratiarvm chorvs  dicat amicitia    EXPLANATION  Dedicated by friendship  to JOSEPH SPENCE  our most excellent Crito  whom  the unanimous consent  of every Muse and Grace  made choice of  to be so distinguished    We now through a small gate enter what is called The Lover's Walk and proceed immediately to a seat where the water is seen very advantageously at full length which though not large is so agreeably shaped and has its bounds so well concealed that the beholder may receive less pleasure from many lakes of greater extent The margin on one side is fringed with alders the other is overhung with most stately oaks and beeches and the middle beyond the water presents the Hales Owen scene with a group of houses on the slope behind and the horizon well  fringed with the wood Now winding a few paces round the margin of the water we come to another small bench which presents the former scene somewhat varied with the addition of a whited village among trees upon a hill Proceeding on we enter the pleasing gloom of this agreeable walk and come to a bench beneath a spreading beech that overhangs both walk and water which has been called The Assignation Seat and has this inscription on the back of it  " Nerine Galatea thymo mihi dulcior Hyblae  " Candidior cygnis hedera formosior alba  " Cum primum pasti repetent praesepia tauri  " Si qua tui Corydonis habet te cura venito  IMITATION  O Galatea Nereus' lovely child  Sweeter than Hybla thyme more undefil'd  Than down of swan or ivy's purest white  When the full oxen warn'd by fading light  Home to the stall their sober footsteps bend  If Damon's dear to Damon's call attend  "  Here the path begins gradually to ascend beneath a depth of shade by the side of which is a small bubbling rill either forming little peninsulas rolling over pebbles or falling down small cascades all under cover and taught to murmur very agreeably This very soft and pensive scene very properly styled The Lover's Walk is terminated with an ornamented urn inscribed to Miss Dolman a beautiful and amiable relation of Mr Shenstone's who died of the smallpox about twentyone years of age in the following words on one side  Peramabili suae consobrinae  M D  On the other side  Ah Maria  pvellarvm elegantissima  ah Flore venvstatis abrepta  vale  hev qvanto minvs est  cvm reliqvis versari  qvant tvi  meminisse  EXPLANATION  Sacred to the memory  of  a most amiable kinswoman  Ah Maria  most elegant of nymphs  snatched from us  in thy bloom of beauty  ah farewell  How much inferior  is the living conversation  of others  to the bare remembrance  of thee    The ascent from hence winds somewhat more steeply to another seat where the eye is thrown over a rough scene of broken and furzy ground upon a piece of water in the flat whose extremities are hid behind trees and shrubs amongst which the house appears and makes upon the whole no unpleasing picture The path still winds under cover up the hill the steep declivity of which is somewhat eased by the serpentine sweep of it till we come to a small bench with this line from Pope's Eloisa  " Divine oblivion of lowthoughted Care"  The opening before it presents a solitary scene of trees thickets and precipice and terminates upon a green hill with a clump of firs on the top of it  We now find the great use as well as beauty of the serpentine path in climbing up this wood the first seat of which alluding to the rural scene before it has the following lines from Virgil  " Hic latis otia fundis  " Speluncae vivique lacus hic frigida Tempe  " Mugitusque boum mollesque sub arbore somni  IMITATION  Here tranquil leisures in the ample field  Here caves and living lakes their pleasures yield  Here vales invite where sports the cooling breeze  And peaceful sleep beneath embow'ring trees  While lowing herds surround  "  Here the eye looking down a slope beneath the spreading arms of oak and beech trees passes first over some rough furzy ground then over water to the large swelling lawn in the centre of which the house is discovered among trees and thickets this forms the fore ground Beyond this appears a swell of waste furzy land diversified with a cottage and a road that winds behind a farmhouse and a fine clump of trees The back scene of all is a semicircular range of hills diversified with woods scenes of cultivation and inclosures to about four or five miles' distance  Still winding up into the wood we come to a slight seat opening through the trees to a bridge of five  piers crossing a large piece of water at about half a mile's distance The next seat looks down from a considerable height along the side of a steep precipice upon irregular and pleasing ground And now we turn upon a sudden into a long straightlined walk in the wood arched over with tall trees and terminating with a small rustic building Though the walk as I said be straightlined yet the base rises and falls so agreeably as leaves no room to censure its formality About the middle of this avenue which runs the whole length of this hanging wood we arrive unexpectedly at a lofty Gothic seat whence we look down a slope more considerable than that before mentioned through the wood on each side This view is indeed a fine one the eye first travelling down over wellvariegated ground into the valley where is a large piece of water whose sloping banks give all the appearance of a noble river The ground from hence rises gradually to the top of Clent hill at three or four miles' distance and the landscape is enriched with a view of Hales Owen the late Lord Dudley's house and a large wood of Lord Lyttleton's It is impossible to give an adequate description of this view the beauty of it depending upon the great variety of objects and beautiful shape of ground and all at such a distance as to admit of being seen distinctly  Hence we proceed to the rustic building before mentioned a slight and unexpensive edifice formed  of rough unhewn stone commonly called here The Temple of Pan having a trophy of the Tibia and Syrinx and this inscription over the entrance  " Pan primus calamos cera conjungere plures  " Edocuit Pan curat oves oviumque magistros  IMITATION  Pan god of shepherds first inspir'd our swains  Their pipes to frame and tune their rural strains  Pan from impending harm the fold defends  And Pan the master of the fold befriends  "  Hence mounting once more to the right through this dark umbrageous walk we enter at once upon a lightsome high natural terrace whence the eye is thrown over all the scenes we have seen before together with many fine additional ones and all beheld from a declivity that approaches as near a precipice as is agreeable In the middle is a seat with this inscription  Divini gloria rvris  EXPLANATION  O glory of the sylvan scene divine    To give a better idea of this by far the most magnificent scene here it were perhaps best to divide it into two distinct partsthe noble concave in the front and the rich valley towards the rightIn regard to the former if a boon companion could enlarge his idea of a punchbowl ornamented within with all the romantic scenery the Chinese ever yet devised it would perhaps afford him the highest idea he could possibly conceive of earthly happiness  he would certainly wish to swim in it Suffice it to say that the horizon or brim is as finely varied as the cavity It would be idle here to mention the Clee hills the Wrekin the Welsh mountains or Caer Caradoc at a prodigious distance which though they finish the scene agreeably should not be mentioned at the Leasowes the beauty of which turns chiefly upon distinguishable scenes The valley upon the right is equally enriched and the opposite side thereof well fringed with woods and the high hills on one side this long winding vale rolling agreeably into the hollows on the other But these are a kind of objects which though really noble in the survey will not strike a reader in description as they would a spectator upon the spot  Hence returning back into the wood and crossing Pan's Temple we go directly down the slope into another part of Mr Shenstone's grounds the path leading down through very pleasing homescenes of wellshaped ground exhibiting a most perfect concave and convex till we come at a seat under a noble beech presenting a rich variety of foreground and at perhaps half a mile's distance the Gothic alcove on a hill well covered with wood a pretty cottage under trees in the more distant part of the concave and a farmhouse upon the right all picturesque objects  The next and the subsequent seat afford pretty much the same scenes a little enlarged with the addition  of that remarkable clump of trees called Frankly Beeches adjoining to the old familyseat of the Lyttletons and from whence the present Lord Lyttleton derives his title  We come now to a handsome Gothic screen backed with a clump of firs which throws the eye in front full upon a cascade in the valley issuing from beneath a dark shade of poplars The house appears in the centre of a large swelling lawn bushed with trees and thicket The pleasing variety of easy swells and hollows bounded by scenes less smooth and cultivated affords the most delightful picture of domestic retirement and tranquillity  We now descend to a seat inclosed with handsome pales and backed with firs inscribed to Lord Lyttleton It presents a beautiful view up a valley contracted gradually and ending in a group of most magnificent oaks and beeches The righthand side is enlivened with two striking cascades and a winding stream seen at intervals between tufts of trees and woodland To the left appears the hanging wood already mentioned with the Gothic screen on the slope in the centre  Winding still downwards we come to a small seat where one of the offices of the house and a view of a cottage on very high ground is seen over the tops of the trees of the grove in the adjacent valley giving an agreeable instance of the abrupt inequality of  ground in this romantic wellvariegated country The next seat shews another face of the same valley the water gliding calmly along betwixt two seeming groves without any cascade as a contrast to the former one where it was broken by cascades the scene very significantly alluded to by the motto  " Rura mihi et rigul placeant in vallibus amnes  " Flumina amem silvasque inglorius  IMITATION  Woods vales and running streams my mind enchant  The woods and streams inglorious let me haunt  "  We descend now to a beautiful gloomy scene called Virgil's Grove where on the entrance we pass by a small obelisk on the right hand with this inscription  P Virgilio Maroni  Lapis iste cvm lvco sacer esto  EXPLANATION  To  P Virgilius Maro  This obelisk  and grove  is consecrated  Note  It was customary with the Romans to give a praenomen or first name in the manner of our Christian names accordingly Virgil had that of Publius He derived the addition of Maro from his father who was so called    Before this is a slight bench where some of the same objects are seen again but in a different point of light It is not very easy either to paint or describe this delightful grove however as the former has been more than once attempted I will hope to apologize for an imperfect description by the difficulty found  by those who have aimed to sketch it with their pencil Be it therefore first observed that the whole scene is opaque and gloomy consisting of a small deep valley or dingle the sides of which are inclosed with irregular tufts of hazel and other underwood and the whole overshadowed with lofty trees rising out of the bottom of the dingle through which a copious stream makes its way through mossy banks enamelled with primroses and variety of wild wood flowers The first seat we approach is thus inscribed  Celeberrimo Poetae  IACOBO THOMSON  Prope fontes illi non fastiditos  G S  Sedem hanc ornavit  EXPLANATION  To the much celebrated Poet JAMES THOMSON This seat was placed near his favourite springs by W S    " Quae tibi quae tali reddam pro carmine dona  " Nam neque me tantum venientis sibilus austri  " Nec percussa juvant fluctu tam littora nec quae  " Saxosas inter decurrunt fl umina valles  IMITATION  How shall I thank thy Muse so form'd to please  For not the whisp'rings of the southern breeze  Nor banks stillbeaten by the breaking wave  Nor limpid rills that pebbly vallies lave  Yield such delight  "  This seat is placed upon a steep bank on the edge of the valley from which the eye is here drawn down  into the flat below by the light that glimmers in front and by the sound of various cascades by which the winding stream is agreeably broken Opposite to this seat the ground rises again in an easy concave to a kind of dripping fountain where a small rill trickles down a rude nich of rockwork through fern liverwort and acquatic weeds the green area in the middle through which the stream winds being as well shaped as can be imagined After falling down these cascades it winds under a bridge of one arch and then empties itself into a small lake which catches it a little below This terminates the scene upon the right and after these objects have for some time amused the spectator his eye rambles to the left where one of the most beautiful cascades imaginable is seen by way of incident through a kind of vista or glade falling down a precipice overarched with trees and strikes us with surprise It is impossible to express the pleasure which one feels on this occasion for though surprise alone is not excellence it may serve to quicken the effect of what is beautiful I believe none ever beheld this grove without a thorough sense of satisfaction and were one to chuse any particular spot of this perfectly Arcadian farm it should perhaps be this although it so well contrasts both with the terrace and with some other scenes that one cannot wish them ever to be divided We now proceed to a seat at the bottom of a large root on the side of a slope with this inscription  INSCRIPTION  ' O let me haunt this peaceful shade  ' Nor let Ambition e'er invade  ' The tenants of this leafy bower  ' That shun her paths and slight her power  ' Hither the peaceful halcyon flies  ' From social meads and open skies  ' Pleas'd by this rill her course to steer  ' And hide her sapphire plumage here  ' The trout bedropp'd with crimson stains  ' Forsakes the river's proud domains  ' Forsakes the sun's unwelcome gleam  ' To lurk within this humble stream  ' And sure I hear the Naiad say  " Flow flow my Stream this devious way  " Tho' lovely soft thy murmurs are  " Thy waters lovely cool and fair  " Flow gentle Stream nor let the vain  " Thy small unsully'd stores disdain  " Nor let the pensive sage repine  " Whose latent course resembles thine"  The view from it is a calm tranquil scene of water gliding through sloping ground with a sketch through the trees of the small pond below  The scene in this place is that of water stealing along through a rude sequestered vale the ground on each side covered with weeds and field flowers as that before is kept close shaven Farther on we lose all sight of water and only hear the noise without having the appearance a kind of effect which the Chinese are fond of producing in what they call their Scenes of enchantment We now turn all on a sudden upon the high cascade which we admired before in  vista The scene around is quite a grotto of native stone running up it roots of trees overhanging it and the whole shaded over head However we first approach upon the left a chalybeat spring with an iron bowl chained to it and this inscription upon a stone  Fons Ferrvginevs  Divae qvae secessv isto frvi concedit  EXPLANATION  To the Goddess  who bestowed the enjoyment  of these retreats  This chalybeat spring  is consecrated    Then turning to the right we find a stone seat making part of the aforesaid cave with this wellapplied inscription  Intus aqvae dulces vivoqve sedilia saxo  Nympharvm domvs  IMITATION  Within are wholesome springs and marble seats  Carv'd in the living rock of Nymphs the bless'd retreats    which I have often heard Mr Shenstone term the definition of a grotto We now wind up a shady path on the left hand and crossing the head of this cascade pass beside the river that supplies it in our way up to the house One seat first occurs under a shady oak as we ascend the hill soon after we enter the shrubbery which half surrounds the house where we find two seats thus inscribed to two of his most particular friends The first thus  Amicitiae et meritis  RICHARDI GRAVES  EXPLANATION  To the  friendship and merits  of  RICHARD GRAVES    Ipsae te Tityre pinvs  Ipsi te fontes ipsa haec arbvsta vocabant  EXPLANATION  Thee Tityrus the pines  The crystal springs the very groves invok'd    and a little further the other with the following inscription  Amicitiae et meritis  RICHARDI JAGO  EXPLANATION  To the  friendship and merits  of  RICHARD JAGO    From this last is an opening down the valley over a large sliding lawn well edged with oaks to a piece of water crossed by a considerable bridge in the flatthe steeple of Hales a village amid trees making on the whole a very pleasing picture Thus winding through flowering shrubs beside a menageric for doves we are conducted to the stables But let it not be forgot that on the entrance into this shrubbery the first object that strikes us is a Venus de Medicis beside a bason of goldfish encompassed round with shrubs and illustrated with the following inscription  "Semireducta Venus  EXPLANATION  Venus halfretired  "  " To Venus Venus here retir'd  " My sober vows I pay  " Not her on Paphian plains admir'd  " The bold the pert the gay  " Not her whose am'rous leer prevail'd  " To bribe the Phrygian boy  " Not her who clad in armour fail'd  " To save disast'rous Troy  " Fresh rising from the foamy tide  " She ev'ry bosom warms  " While half withdrawn she seems to hide  " And half reveals her charms  " Learn hence ye boastful sons of Taste  " Who plan the rural shade  " Learn hence to shun the vicious waste  " Of pomp at large display'd  " Let sweet Concealment's magic art  " Your mazy bounds invest  " And while the sight unveils a part  " Let Fancy paint the rest  " Let coy Reserve with Cost unite  " To grace your wood or field  " No ray obtrusive pall the sight  " In aught you paint or build  " And far be driv'n the sumptuous glare  " Of gold from British groves  " And far the meretricious air  " Of China's vain alcoves  " Tis bashful Beauty ever twines  " The most coercive chain  " 'Tis she that sovereign rule declines  " Who best deserves to reign"  VERSES TO MR SHENSTONE  Written on a Ferme Ornée near Birmingham  BY THE LATE LADY LUXBOROUGH  'TIS Nature here bids pleasing scenes arise  And wisely gives them Cynthio to revise  To veil each blemish brighten ev'ry grace  Yet still preserve the lovely parent's face  How well the Bard obeys each valley

fresh pride adopts the work of man  TO WILLIAM SHENSTONE ESQ AT THE LEASOWES  BY MR GRAVES  " Veilem in amicitia sic erraremus  IMITATION  In friendship thus O be we still beguil'd  "  HOR  SEE the tall youth by partial Fate's decree  To affluence born and from restraint set free  Eager he seeks the scenes of gay resort  The Mall the rout the playhouse and the court  Soon for some varnish'd nymph of dubious fame  Or powder'd peeress counterfeits a flame  Behold him now enraptur'd swear and sigh  Dress dance drink revel all he knows not why  Till by kind Fate restor'd to country air  He marks the roses of some rural fair  Smit with her unaffected native charms  A real passion soon his bosom warms  And wak'd from idle dreams he takes a wife  And tastes the genuine happiness of life  Thus in the vacant season of the year  Some Templar gay begins his wild career  From seat to seat o'er pompous scenes he flies  Views all with equal wonder and surprise  Till sick of domes arcades and temples grown  He hies fatigu'd not satisfy'd to Town  Yet if some kinder genius point his way  To where the Muses o'er thy Leasowes stray  Charm'd with the sylvan beauties of the place  Where Art assumes the sweets of Nature's face  Each hill each dale each consecrated grove  Each lake and falling stream his rapture move  Like the sage captive in Calypso's grot  The cares the pleasures of the

Health and sweet converse with the Muse he loves  The humblest vot'ry of the tuneful Nine  With trembling hand attempts her artless line  In numbers such as untaught Nature brings  As flow spontaneous

ARRIVAL AT THE LEASOWES    " How shall I fix my wand'ring eye where find  " The source of this enchantment Dwells it in  " The woods or waves there not a magic wand  " O'er the translucent waters Sure unseen  " Some fav'ring power directs the happy lines  " That sketch these beauties swells the rising hills  " And scoops the dales to Nature's finest forms  " Vague undetermin'd infinite untaught  " By line or compass yet supremely fair"  So spake Philenor as with raptur'd gaze  He travers'd Damon's farm from distant plains  He sought his friend's abode nor had the fame  Of that newform'd Arcadia reach'd his ear  And thus the swain as o'er each hill and dale  Thro' lawn or thicket he pursu'd his way  " What is it gilds the verdure of these meads  " With hues more bright than Fancy paints the flowers  " Of Paradise What Naïad's guiding hand  " Leads thro' the broider'd vale these lucid rills  " That murm'ring as they flow bear melody  " Along their banks and thro' the vocal shades  " Improve the music of the woodland choir  " What pensive Dryad rais'd yon' solemn grove  " Where minds contemplative at close of day  " Retiring muse o'er Nature's various works  " Her wonders venerate or her sweets enjoy  " What room for doubt some rural deity  " Presiding scatters o'er th' unequal lawns  " In beauteous wildness yon' fairspreading trees  " And mingling woods and waters hills and

dream'd and dancing Fauns  Or Naïad leaning o'er her tinkling urn  Oh could I learn to sanctify my strains  With hymns like those by tuneful Meyrick sung  Or rather catch the melancholy sounds  From Warton's reed or Mason's lyreto paint  The sudden gloom that damps my soulBut see  Melpomene herself has snatch'd the pipe  With which sad Lyttleton his Lucia mourn'd  And plaintive cries My Shenstone

and vocal hills  By mossy grots near purling rills  Where'er you turn your wond'ring eyes  Behold her win without disguise  What tho' no pageant trifles here  As in the glare of courts appear  Tho' rarely here be heard the name  Of rank or title power or fame  Yet if ingenuous be your mind  A bliss more pure and unconfin'd  Your step attendsDraw freely nigh  And meet the Bard's benignant eye  On him no pedant forms await  No proud reserve shuts up his gate  No spleen no party views control  That warm benevolence of soul  Which prompts the friendly gen'rous part  Regardless of each venal art  Regardless of the world's acclaim  And courteous with no selfish aim  Draw freely nigh and welcome find  If not the costly yet the kind  Oh he will lead you to the cells  Where ev'ry Muse and Virtue dwells  Where the green Dryads guard his woods  Where the blue Naïads guide his floods  Where all the Sister Graces gay  That shap'd his walk's meand'ring way  Starknaked or but wreath'd with flowers  Lie slumb'ring soft beneath his bowers  Wak'd by the stockdove's melting strain  Behold them rise and with the train  Of Nymphs that haunt the stream or grove  Or o'er the flow'ry champain rove  Join hand in handattentive gaze  And mark the dance's mystic maze  " Such is the waving line" they cry  " For ever dear to Fancy's eye  " Yon' stream that wanders down the dale  " The spiral wood the winding vale  " The path which wrought with hidden skill  " Slow twining scales yon' distant hill  " With fir investedall combine  " To recommend the waving line  " The wreathed rod of Bacchus fair  " The ringlets of Apollo's hair  " The wand by Maïa's offspring borne  " The smooth volutes of Ammon's horn  " The structure of the Cyprian dame  " And each fair female's beauteous frame  " Shew to the pupils of Design  " The triumphs of the waving line"  Then gaze and mark that union sweet  Where fair convex and concave meet  And while quick shifting as you stray  The vivid scenes on fancy play  The lawn of aspect smooth and mild  The forest ground grotesque and wild  The shrub that scents the mountain gale  The stream rough dashing down the dale  From rock to rock in eddies tost  The distant lake in which 'tis lost  Blue hills gay beaming thro' the glade  Lon  urns that solemnize the shade  Sweet interchange of all that charms  In groves meads dingles riv'lets farms  If aught the fair

Nature's face  Go scorn Simplicitybut know  That all our heartfelt joys below  That all which Virtue loves to name  Which Art consigns to lasting fame  Which fixes Wit or Beauty's throne  Derives its source from her alone  ARCADIO  TO WILLIAM SHENSTONE ESQ IN HIS SICKNESS  BY MR WOODHOUSE  YE flow'ry Plains ye breezy Woods  Ye Bowers and gay Alcoves  Ye falling Streams ye silver Floods  Ye Grottoes and ye Groves  Alas my heart feels no delight  Tho' I your charms survey  While he consumes in pain the night  In languid sighs the day  The flowers disclose a thousand blooms  A thousand scents diffuse  Yet all in vain they shed perfumes  In vain display their hues  Restrain ye Flowers your thoughtless pride  Recline your gaudy heads  And sadly drooping side by side  Embrace your humid beds  Tall Oaks that o'er the woodland shade  Your lofty summits rear  Ah why in wonted charms array'd  Expand your leaves so fair  For lo the flowers as gayly smile  As wanton waves the tree  And tho' I sadly 'plain the while  Yet they regard not me  Ah should the Fates an arrow send  And strike the fatal wound  Who who shall then your sweets defend  Or fence your beauties round  But hark perhaps the plumy throng  Have learn'd my plaintive tale  And some sad dirge or mournful song  Comes floting in the gale  Ah no they chant a sprightly strain  To sooth an am'rous mate  Unmindful of my anxious pain  And his uncertain fate  But see these little murm'ring rills  With fond repinings rove  And trickle wailing down the hills  Or weep along the grove  Oh mock not if beside your stream  You hear me too repine  Or aid with sighs your mournful theme  And fondly call him mine  Ye envious Winds the cause display  In whispers as ye blow  Why did your treach'rous gales convey  The poison'd shafts of woe  Did he not plant the shady bower  Where you so blithly meet  The scented shrub and fragrant flower  To make your breezes sweet  And must he leave the wood the field  The dear Arcadian reign  Can neither verse nor virtue shield  The guardian of the plain  Must he his tuneful breath resign  Whom all the Muses love  That round his brow their laurels twine  And all his songs approve  Preserve him mild Omnipotence  Our Father King and God  Who clear'st the paths of life and sense  Or stopp'st them at thy nod  Bless'd Power who calm'st the raging deep  His valued health restore  Nor let the sons of Genius weep  Nor let the Good deplore  But if thy boundless wisdom knows  His longer date an ill  Let not my soul a wish disclose  To contradict thy will  For happy happy were the change  For such a godlike mind  To go where kindred spirits range  Nor leave a wish behind  And tho' to share his pleasures here  Kings might their state forego  Yet must he feel such raptures there  As none can taste below  VERSES LEFT ON A SEAT  THE HAND UNKNOWN  O EARTH to his remains indulgent be  Who so much care and cost bestow'd on thee  Who crown'd thy barren hills with useful shade  And cheer'd with tinkling rills each silent glade  Here taught the day to wear a thoughtful gloom  And there enliven'd Nature's vernal bloom  Propitious Earth lie lightly on his head  And ever on his tomb thy vernal glories spread  CORYDON A PASTORAL TO THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM SHENSTONE ESQ  BY MR J CUNNINGHAM  I  COME Shepherds we'll follow the h  rse  And see our lov'd Corydon laid  Tho' sorrow may blemish the verse  Yet let the sad tribute be paid  They call'd him the Pride of the plain  In sooth he was gentle and kind  He mark'd in his elegant strain  The graces that glow'd in his mind  II  On purpose he planted yon' trees  That birds in the covert might dwell  He cultur'd his thyme for the bees  But never would rifle their cell  Ye Lambkins that play'd at his feet  Go bleatand your master bemoan  His music was artless and sweet  His manners as mild as your own  III  No verdure shall cover the vale  No bloom on the blossoms appear  The sweets of the forest shall fail  And winter discolour the year  No birds in our hedges shall sing  Our hedges so vocal before  Since he that should welcome the spring  Can greet the gay season no more  IV  His Phyllis was fond of his praise  And poets came round in a throng  They listen'd and envy'd his lays  But which of them equall'd his song  Ye Shepherds henceforward be mute  For lost is the Pastoral strain  So give me my Corydon's flute  And thuslet me break it in twain  ELEGIES WRITTEN ON MANY DIFFERENT OCCASIONS  Tantum inter densas umbrosa cacumina fagas  Assidue veniebat ibi haec incondita solus  Montibus et silvis studio

ELEGY I He arrives at his retirement in the country and takes occasion to expatiate in praise of simplicity To a Friend  FOR rural virtues and for native skies  I bade Augusta's venal sons farewell  Now 'mid the trees I see my smoke arise  Now hear the fountains bubbling round my cell  O may that Genius which secures my rest  Preserve this villa for a friend that's dear  Ne'er may my vintage glad the sordid breast  N'er tinge the lip that dares be unsincere  Far from these paths ye faithless Friends depart  Fly my plain board abhor my hostile name  Hence the saint verse that flows not from the heart  But mourns in labour'd strains the price of fame  O lov'd Simplicity be thine the prize  Assiduous Art correct her page in vain  His be the palm who guiltless of disguise  Contemns the pow'r the dull resourse to feign  Still may the mourner lavish of his tears  For lucre's venal meed invite my scorn  Still may the bard dissembling doubts and tears  For praise for flatt'ry sighing sigh forlorn  Soft as the line of lovesick Hammond flows  'Twas his fond heart effus'd the melting theme  Ah never could Aonia's hill disclose  So fair a fountain or so lov'd a stream  Ye loveless Bards intent with artful pains  To form a sigh or to contrive a tear  Forego your Pindus and on plains  Survey Camilla's charms and grow sincere  But thou my Friend while in thy youthful soul  Love's gentle tyrant seats his awful throne  Write from thy bosomlet not Art control  The ready pen that makes his edicts known  Pleasing when youth is long expir'd to trace  The forms our pencil or our pen design'd  " Such was our youthful air and shape and face  " Such the soft image of our youthful mind"  Soft whilst we sleep beneath the rural bow'rs  The Loves and Graces steal unseen away  And where the turf diffus'd its pomp of flow'rs  We wake to wintry scenes of chill decay  Curse the sad fortune that detains thy fair  Praise the soft hours that gave thee to her arms  Paint thy proud scorn of ev'ry vulgar care  When hope exalts thee or when doubt alarms  Where with Oenone thou hast worn the day  Near font or stream in meditation rove  If in the grove Oenone lov'd to stray  The faithful Muse shall meet thee in the grove  ELEGY II On posthumous reputation To a Friend  O GRIEF of griefs that Envy's frantic ire  Should rob the living virtue of its praise  O foolish Muses that with zeal aspire  To deck the cold insensate shrine with bays  When the free spirit quits her humble frame  To tread the skies with radiant garlands crown'd  Say will she hear the distant voice of Fame  Or hearing fancy sweetness in the sound  Perhaps even Genius pours a slighted lay  Perhaps ev'n Friendship sheds a fruitless tear  Ev'n Lyttleton but vainly trims the bay  And fondly graces Hammond's mournful bier  Tho' weeping virgins haunt his favour'd urn  Renew their chaplets and repeat their sighs  Tho' near his tomb Sabaean odours burn  The loit'ring fragrance will it reach the skies  No should his Delia votive wreaths prepare  Delia might place the votive wreaths in vain  Yet the dear hope of Delia's future care  Once crown'd his pleasures and dispell'd his pain  Yesthe fair prospect of surviving praise  Can ev'ry sense of present joys excel  For this great Hadrian chose laborious days  Thro' this expiring bade a gay farewell  Shall then our youths who Fame's bright fabric raise  To life's precarious date confine their care  O teach them you to spread the sacred base  To plan a work thro' latest ages fair  Is it small transport as with curious eye  You trace the story of each Attic sage  To think your blooming praise shall time defy  Shall waft like odours thro' the pleasing page  To mark the day when thro' the bulky tome  Around your name the varying style refines  And readers call their lost attention home  Led by that index where true genius shines  Ah let not Britons doubt their social aim  Whose ardent bosoms catch this ancient fire  Cold int'rest melts before the vivid flame  And patriot ardours but with life expire  ELEGY III On the untimely death of a certain learned acquaintance  IF proud Pygmalion quit his cumb'rous frame  Funereal pomp the scanty tear supplies  Whilst heralds loud with venal voice proclaim  Lo here the brave and the puissant lies  When humbler Alcon leaves his drooping friends  Pageant nor plume distinguish Alcon's bier  The faithful Muse with votive song attends  And blots the mournful numbers with a tear  He little knew the sly penurious art  That odious art which Fortune's fav'rites know  Form'd to bestow he felt the warmest heart  But envious Fate forbade him to bestow  He little knew to ward the secret wound  He little knew that mortals could ensnare  Virtue he knew the noblest joy he found  To sing her glories and to paint her fair  Ill was he skill'd to guide his wand'ring sheep  And unforeseen disaster thinn'd his fold  Yet at another's loss the swain would weep  And for his friend his very crook was sold  Ye sons of Wealth protect the Muses' train  From winds protect them and with food supply  Ah helpless they to ward the threaten'd pain  The meagre famine and the wintry sky  He lov'd a nymph amidst his slender store  He dar'd to love and Cynthia was his theme  He breath'd his plaints along the rocky shore  They only echo'd o'er the winding stream  His nymph was fair the sweetest bud that blows  Revives less lovely from the recent show'r  So Philomel enamour'd eyes the rose  Sweet bird enamour'd of the sweetest flow'r  He lov'd the Muse she taught him to complain  He saw his tim'rous loves on her depend  He lov'd the Muse altho' she taught in vain  He lov'd the Muse for she was Virtue's friend  She guides the foot that treads on Parian floors  She wins the ear when formal pleas are vain  She tempts Patricians from the fatal doors  Of Vice's brothel forth to Virtue's fane  He wish'd for wealth for much he wish'd to give  He griev'd that virtue might not wealth obtain  Piteous of woes and hopeless to relieve  The pensive prospect sadden'd all his strain  I saw him faint I saw him sink to rest  Like one ordain'd to swell the vulgar throng  As tho' the Virtues had not warm'd his breast  As tho' the Muses not inspir'd his tongue  I saw his bier ignobly cross the plain  Saw peasant hands the pious rite supply  The gen'rous rustics mourn'd the friendly swain  But Pow'r and Wealth's unvarying cheek was dry  Such Alcon fell in meagre want forlorn  Where were ye then ye pow'rful Patrons where  Would ye the purple should your limbs adorn  Go wash the conscious blemish with a tear  ELEGY IV Ophelia's urn To Mr G  THRO' the dim veil of ev'ning's dusky shade  Near some lone fane or yew's funereal green  What dreary forms has magic Fear survey'd  What shrouded spectres Superstition seen  But you secure shall pour your sad complaint  Nor dread the meagre phantom's wan array  What none but Fear's officious hand can paint  What none but Superstition's eye survey  The glimm'ring twilight and the doubtful dawn  Shall see your step to these sad scenes return  Constant as crystal dews impearl the lawn  Shall Strephon's tear bedew Ophelia's urn  Sure nought unhallow'd shall presume to stray  Where sleep the reliques of that virtuous maid  Nor aught unlovely bend its devious way  Where soft Ophelia's dear remains are laid  Haply thy Muse as with unceasing sighs  She keeps late vigils on her urn reclin'd  May see light groups of pleasing visions rise  And phantoms glide but of celestial kind  Then Fame her clarion pendent at her side  Shall seek forgiveness of Ophelia's shade  " Why has such worth without distinction dy'd  " Why like the desert's lily bloom'd to fade"  Then young Simplicity averse to feign  Shall unmolested breathe her softest sigh  And Candour with unwonted warmth complain  And Innocence indulge a wailful cry  Then Elegance with coy judicious hand  Shall cull fresh flow'rets for Ophelia's tomb  And Beauty chide the Fates' severe command  That shew'd the frailty of so fair a bloom  And Fancy then with wild ungovern'd woe  Shall her lov'd pupil's native taste explain  For mournful sable all her hues forego  And ask sweet solace of the Muse in vain  Ah gentle Forms expect no fond relief  Too much the sacred Nine their loss deplore  Well may ye grieve nor find an end of grief  Your best your brightest fav'rite is no more  ELEGY V He compares the turbulence of love with the tranquillity of friendship To Melissa his friend  FROM Love from angry Love's inclement reign  I pass a while to Friendship's equal skies  Thou gen'rous Maid reliev'st my partial pain  And cheer'st the victim of another's eyes  'Tis thou Melissa thou deserv'st my care  How can my will and reason disagree  How can my passion live beneath despair  How can my bosom sigh for aught but thee  Ah dear Melissa pleas'd with thee to rove  My soul has yet surviv'd its dreariest time  Ill can I bear the various clime of Love  Love is a pleasing but a various clime  So smiles immortal Maro's fav'rite shore  Parthenope with ev'ry verdure crown'd  When straight Vesuvio's horrid caldrons roar  And the dry vapour blasts the regions round  Oh blissful regions oh unrivall'd plains  When Maro to these fragrant haunts retir'd  Oh fatal realms and oh accurs'd domains  When Pliny 'mid sulphureous clouds expir'd  So smiles the surface of the treach'rous main  As o'er its waves the peaceful halcyons play  When soon rude winds their wonted rule regain  And sky and ocean mingle in the fray  But let or air contend or ocean rave  Ev'n Hope subside amid the billows tost  Hope still emergent still contemns the wave  And not a feature's wonted smile is lost  ELEGY VI To a Lady on the language of birds  COME then Dione let us range the grove  The science of the feather'd choirs explore  Hear linnets argue larks descant of love  And blame the gloom of solitude no more  My doubt subsides'tis no Italian song  Nor senseless ditty cheers the vernal tree  Ah who that hears Dione's tuneful tongue  Shall doubt that music may with sense agree  And come my Muse that lov'st the sylvan shade  volve the mazes and the mist dispel  Translate the song convince my doubting maid  o solemn dervise can explain so well  Pensive beneath the twilight shades I sate  The slave of hopeless vows and cold disdain  When Philomel address'd his mournful mate  And thus I constru'd the mellifluent strain  " Sing on my birdthe liquid notes prolong  " At ev'ry note a lover sheds his tear  " Sing on my bird'tis Damon hears thy song  " Nor doubt to gain applause when lovers hear  " He the sad source of our complaining knows  " A foe to Tereus and to lawless love  " He mourns the story of our ancient woes  " Ah could our music his complaint remove  " Yon' plains are govern'd by a peerless maid  " And see pale Cynthia mounts the vaulted sky  " A train of lovers court the chequer'd shade  " Sing on my bird and hear thy mates reply  " Erewhile no shepherd to these woods retir'd  " No lover bless'd the glowworm's pallid ray  " But illstar'd birds that list'ning not admir'd  " Or list'ning envy'd our superior lay  " Cheer'd by the sun the vassals of his pow'r  " Let such by day unite their jarring strains  " But let us chuse the calm the silent hour  " Nor want fit audience while Dione reigns"  ELEGY VII He describes his vision to an acquaintance  Caetera per terras omnes animalia c  VIRG  IMITATION  All animals beside o'er all the earth c  ON distant heaths beneath autumnal skies  Pensive I saw the circling shade descend  Weary and faint I heard the storm arise  While the sun vanish'd like a faithless friend  No kind companion led my steps aright  No friendly planet lent its glimm'ring ray  Ev'n the lone cot refus'd its wonted light  Where Toil in peaceful slumber clos'd the day  Then the dull bell had giv'n a pleasing sound  The village cur 'twere transport then to hear  In dreadful silence all was hush'd around  While the rude storm alone distress'd mine ear  As led by Orwell's winding banks I stray'd  Where tow'ring Wolsey breath'd his native air  A sudden lustre chas'd the flitting shade  The sounding winds were hush'd and all was fair  Instant a grateful form appear'd confest  White were his locks with awful scarlet crown'd  And livelier far than Tyrian seem'd his vest  That with the glowing purple ting'd the ground  " Stranger" he said "amid this pealing rain  " Benighted lonesome whither wouldst thou stray  " Does wealth or pow'r thy weary step constrain  " Reveal thy wish and let me point the way  " For know I trod the trophy'd paths of pow'r  " Felt ev'ry joy that fair Ambition brings  " And lest the lonely roof of yonder bow'r  " To stand beneath the canopies of kings  " I bade low hinds the tow'ring ardour share  " Nor meanly rose to bless myself alone  " I snatch'd the shepherd from his fleecy care  " And bade his wholesome dictate guard the throne  " Low at my feet the suppliant peer I saw  " I saw proud empires my decision wait  " My will was duty and my word was law  " My smile was transport and my frown was fate"  Ah me said I nor pow'r I seek nor gain  Nor urg'd by hope of same these toils endure  A simple youth that feels a lover's pain  And from his friend's condolence hopes a cure  He the dear youth to whose abodes I roam  Nor can mine honours nor my fields extend  Yet for his sake I leave my distant home  Which oaks embosom and which hills defend  Beneath that home I scorn the wintry wind  The Spring to shade me robes her fairest tree  And if a friend my grassgrown threshold find  O how my lonely cot resounds with glee  Yet tho' averse to gold in heaps amass'd  I wish to bless I languish to bestow  And tho' no friend to Fame's obstrep'rous blast  Still to her dulcet murmurs not a foe  Too proud with servile tone to deign address  Too mean to think that honours are my due  Yet should some patron yield my stores to bless  I sure should deem my boundless thanks were few  But tell me thou that like a meteor's fire  Shott'st blazing forth disdaining dull degrees  Should I to wealth to fame to pow'r aspire  Must I not pass more rugged paths than these  Must I not groan beneath a guilty load  Praise him I scorn and him I love betray  Does not felonious Envy bar the road  Or Falsehood's treach'rous foot beset the way  Say should I pass thro' Favour's crowded gate  Must not fair Truth inglorious wait behind  Whilst I approach the glitt'ring scenes of state  My best companion no admittance find  Nurs'd in the shades by Freedom's lenient care  Shall I the rigid sway of Fortune own  Taught by the voice of pious Truth prepare  To spurn an altar and adore a throne  And when proud Fortune's ebbing tide recedes  And when it leaves me no unshaken friend  Shall I not weep that e'er I left the meads  Which oaks embosom and which hills defend  Oh if these ills the price of pow'r advance  Check not my speed where social joys invite  The troubled vision cast a mournful glance  And sighing vanish'd in the shades of night  ELEGY VIII He describes his early love of poetry and its consequences To Mr G    NB  Written after the death of Mr Pope    AH me what envious magic thins my fold  What mutter'd spell retards their late increase  Such less'ning fleeces must the swain behold  That e'er with Doric pipe essays to please  I saw my friends in ev'ning circles meet  I took my vocal reed and tun'd my lay  I heard them say my vocal reed was sweet  Ah fool to credit what I heard them say  Illfated Bard that seeks his skill to show  Then courts the judgment of a friendly ear  Not the poor vet'ran that permits his foe  To guide his doubtful step has more to fear  Nor could my G mistake the critic's laws  Till pious Friendship mark'd the pleasing way  Welcome such error ever bless'd the cause  Ev'n tho' it led me boundless leagues astray  Couldst thou reprove me when I nurs'd the flame  On list'ning Cherwell's osier banks reclin'd  While foe to Fortune unseduc'd by Fame  I sooth'd the bias of a careless mind  Youth's gentle kindred Health and Love were met  What tho' in Alma's guardian arms I play'd  How shall the Muse those vacant hours forget  Or deem that bliss by solid cares repaid  Thou know'st how transport thrills the tender breast  Where Love and Fancy fix their op'ning reign  How Nature shines in livelier colours drest  To bless their union and to grace their train  So first when Phoebus met the Cyprian queen  And favour'd Rhodes beheld their passion crown'd  Unusual flow'rs enrich'd the painted green  And swift spontaneous roses blush'd around  Now sadly lorn from Twitnam's widow'd bow'r  The drooping Muses take their casual way  And where they stop a flood of tears they pour  And where they weep no more the fields are gay  Where is the dappled pink the sprightly rose  The cowslip's golden cup no more I see  Dark and discolour'd ev'ry flow'r that blows  To form the garland Elegy for thee  Enough of tears has wept the virtuous dead  Ah might we now the pious rage control  Hush'd be my grief ere ev'ry smile be fled  Ere the deepswelling sigh subvert the soul  If near some trophy spring a stripling bay  Pleas'd we behold the graceful umbrage rise  But soon too deep it works its baneful way  And low on earth the prostrate ruin lies  Alludes to what is reported of the baytree that if it is planted too near the walls of an edifice its roots will work their way underneath till they destroy the foundation    ELEGY IX He describes his disinterestedness to a friend  I NE'ER must tinge my lip with Celtic wines  The pomp of India must I ne'er display  Nor boast the produce of Peruvian mines  Nor with Italian sounds deceive the day  Down yonder brook my crystal bev'rage flows  My grateful sheep their annual fleeces bring  Fair in my garden buds the damask rose  And from my grove I hear the throstle sing  My fellow swains avert your dazzled eyes  In vain allur'd by glitt'ring spoils they rove  The Fates ne'er meant them for the shepherd's prize  Yet gave them ample recompense in love  They gave you vigour from your parents' veins  They gave you toils but toils your sinews brace  They gave you nymphs that own their am'rous pains  And shades the refuge of the gentle race  To carve your loves to paint your mutual flames  See polish'd fair the beech's friendly rind  To sing soft carols to your lovely dames  See vocal grots and echoing vales assign'd  Wouldst thou my Strephon Love's delighted slave  Tho' sure the wreaths of chivalry to share  Forego the ribbon thy Matilda gave  And giving bade thee in remembrance wear  Ill fare my peace but ev'ry idle toy  If to my mind my Delia's form it brings  Has truer worth imparts sincerer joy  Than all that bears the radiant stamp of kings  O my soul weeps my breast with anguish bleeds  When Love deplores the tyrant pow'r of Gain  Disdaining riches as the futile weeds  I rise superior and the rich disdain  Oft'

Muse's friend of old  Tho' now exalted to yon' ambient sky  So shunn'd a soul distain'd with earth and gold  So lov'd the pure the gen'rous breast as I  Scorn'd be the wretch that quits his genial bowl  His loves his friendships ev'n his self resigns  Perverts the sacred instinct of his soul  And to a ducat's dirty sphere confines  But come my Friend with taste with science blest  Ere age impair me and ere gold allure  Restore thy dear idea to my breast  The rich deposite shall the shrine secure  Let others toil to gain the sordid ore  The charms of independence let us sing  Bless'd with thy friendship can I wish for more  I'll spurn the boasted wealth of Lydia's king  Croesus    ELEGY X To Fortune suggesting his motive for repining at her dispensations  ASK not the cause why this rebellious tongue  Loads with fresh curses thy detested sway  Ask not thus branded in my softest song  Why stands the flatter'd name which all obey  'Tis not that in my shed I lurk forlorn  Nor see my roof on Parian columns rise  That on this breast no mimic star is borne  Rever'd ah more than those that light the skies  'Tis not that on the turf supinely laid  I sing or pipe but to the flocks that graze  And all inglorious in the lonesome shade  My finger stiffens and my voice decays  Not that my fancy mourns thy stern command  When many an embryo dome is lost in air  While guardian Prudence checks my eager hand  And ere the turf is broken cries "Forbear  " Forbear vain Youth be cautious weigh thy gold  " Nor let yon' rising column more aspire  " Ah better dwell in ruins than behold  " Thy fortunes mould'ring and thy domes entire  " Honorio built but dar'd my laws desy  " He planted scornful of my sage commands  " The peach's vernal bud regal'd his eye  " The fruitage ripen'd for more frugal hands"  See the small stream that pours its murm'ring tide  O'er some rough rock that would its wealth display  Displays it aught but penury and pride  Ah construe wisely what such murmurs say  How would some flood with ampler treasures blest  Disdainful view the scantling drops distil  How must Velino  A river in Italy that falls yards perpendicular  shake his reedy crest  How ev'ry cygnet mock the boastive rill  Fortune I yield and see I give the sign  At noon the poor mechanic wanders home  Collects the square the level and the line  And with retorted eye forsakes the dome  Yes I can patient view the shadeless plains  Can unrepining leave the rising wall  Check the fond love of art that fir'd my veins  And my warm hopes in full pursuit recall  Descend ye Storms destroy my rising pile  Loos'd be the whirlwind's unremitting sway  Contented I altho' the gazer smile  To see it scarce survive a winter's day  Let some dull dotard bask in thy gay shrine  As in the sun regales his wanton herd  Guiltless of envy why should I repine  That his rude voice his grating reed's preferr'd  Let him exult with boundless wealth supply'd  Mine and the swain's reluctant homage share  But ah his tawdry shepherdess's pride  Gods must my Delia must my Delia bear  Must Delia's softness elegance and ease  Submit to Marian's dress to Marian's gold  Must Marian's robe from distant India please  The simple fleece my Delia's limbs enfold  " Yet sure on Delia seems the russet fair  " Ye glitt'ring daughters of Disguise adieu"  So talk the wise who judge of shape and air  But will the rural thane decide so true  Ah what is native worth esteem'd of clowns  'Tis thy false glare O Fortune thine they see  'Tis for my Delia's sake I dread thy frowns  And my last gasp shall curses breathe on thee  ELEGY XI He complains how soon the pleasing novelty of life is over  To Mr J  AH me my Friend it will not will not last  This fairy scene that cheats our youthful eyes  The charm dissolves th' aërial music's past  The banquet ceases and the vision flies  Where are the splendid forms the rich perfumes  Where the gay tapers where the spacious dome  Vanish'd the costly pearls the crimson plumes  And we delightless left to wander home  Vain now are books the sage's wisdom vain  What has the world to bribe our steps astray  Ere Reason learns by study'd laws to reign  The weaken'd passions selfsubdu'd obey  Scarce has the sun sev'n annual courses roll'd  Scarce shewn the whole that Fortune can supply  Since not the miser so caress'd his gold  As I for what it gave was heard to sigh  On the world's stage I wish'd some sprightly part  To deck my native fleece with tawdry lace  'Twas life 'twas taste andoh my foolish heart  Substantial joy was fix'd in pow'r and place  And you ye works of Art allur'd mine eye  The breathing picture and the living stone  " Tho' gold tho' splendour Heav'n and Fate deny  " Yet might I call one Titian stroke my own"  Smit with the charms of Fame whose lovely spoil  The wreath the garland fire the poet's pride  I trimm'd my lamp consum'd the midnight oil  But soon the paths of health and fame divide  Oft' too I pray'd 'twas Nature form'd the pray'r  To grace my native scenes my rural home  To see my trees express their planter's care  And gay on Attic models raise my dome  But now 'tis o'er the dear delusion's o'er  A stagnant breezeless air becalms my soul  A fond aspiring candidate no more  I scorn the palm before I reach the goal  O Youth enchanting stage profusely bless'd  Bliss ev'n obtrusive courts the frolic mind  Of health neglectful yet by health caress'd  Careless of favour yet secure to find  Then glows the breast as op'ning roses fair  More free more vivid than the linnet's wing  Honest as light transparent ev'n as air  Tender as buds and lavish as the spring  Not all the force of manhood's active might  Not all the craft to subtle age assign'd  Not science shall extort that dear delight  Which gay delusion gave the tender mind  Adieu soft raptures transports void of care  Parent of raptures dear Deceit adieu  And you her daughters pining with despair  Why why so soon her fleeting steps pursue  Tedious again to curse the drizling day  Again to trace the wint'ry tracts of snow  Or sooth'd by vernal airs again survey  The selfsame hawthorns bud and cowslips blow  O Life how soon of ev'ry bliss forlorn  We start false joys and urge the devious race  A tender prey that cheers our youthful morn  Then sinks untimely and defrauds the chase  ELEGY XII His recantation  No more the Muse obtrudes her thin disguise  No more with awkward fallacy complains  How ev'ry fervour from my bosom flies  And Reason in her lonesome palace reigns  Ere the chill winter of our days arrive  No

train that shine  The star of Venus lends her brightest ray  When other stars their friendly beams resign  Still in my breast one soft desire remains  Pure as that star from guilt from int'rest free  Has gentle Delia tripp'd across the plains  And need I Florio name that wish to thee  While cloy'd to find the scenes of life the same  I tune with careless hand my languid lays  Some secret impulse wakes my former flame  And fires my strain with hopes of brighter days  I slept not long beneath yon' rural bow'rs  And lo my crook with flow'rs adorn'd I see  Has gentle Delia bound my crook with flow'rs  And need I Florio name my hopes to thee  ELEGY XIII To a friend on some slight occasion estranged from him  HEALTH to my friend and many a cheerful day  Around his seat may peaceful shades

breast the cordial wish resume  Ere wintry doubt its tender warmth destroy  Say were it ours by Fortune's wild command  By chance to meet beneath the Torrid Zone  Wouldst thou reject thy Damon's plighted hand  Wouldst thou with scorn thy oncelov'd friend disown  Life is that stranger land that alien clime  Shall kindred souls forego their social claim  Launch'd in the vast abyss of space and time  Shall dark suspicion quench the gen'rous flame  Myriads of souls that knew one parent mould  See sadly sever'd by the laws of Chance  Myriads in Time's perennial list enroll'd  Forbid by Fate to change one transient glance  But we have metwhere ills of ev'ry form  Where passions rage and hurricanes descend  Say shall we nurse the rage assist the storm  And guide them to the bosomof a friend  Yes we have metthro' rapine fraud and wrong  Might our joint aid the paths of peace explore  Why leave thy friend amid the boist'rous throng  Ere death divide us and we part no more  For oh pale Sickness warns thy friend away  For me no more the vernal roses bloom  I see stern Fate his ebon wand display  And point the wither'd regions of the tomb  Then the keen anguish from thine eye shall start  Sad as thou follow'st my untimely bier  " Fool that I wasif friends so soon must part  " To let suspicion intermix a fear"  ELEGY XIV Declining an invitation to visit foreign countries he takes

And court the Genius of my native land  Deluded Youth that quits these verdant plains  To catch the follies of an alien soil  To win the vice his genuine soul disdains  Return exultant and import the

its native clime  An awkward stranger if we waft it o'er  Why then these toils this costly waste of time  To spread soft poison on our happy shore  I covet not the pride of foreign looms  In search of foreign modes I scorn to rove  Nor for the worthless bird of brighter plumes  Would change the meanest warbler of my grove  No distant clime shall servile airs impart  Or form these limbs with pliant ease to play  Trembling I view the Gaul's illusive art  That steals my lov'd rusticity away  'Tis long since Freedom fled th' Hesperian clime  Her citron groves her flow'rembroider'd shore  She saw

palm Idume vents her moan  Raptur'd she once beheld its friendly shade  And hoary Memphis boasts her tombs alone  The mournful types of mighty pow'r decay'd  No Crescent here displays its baneful horns  No turban'd host the voice of Truth reproves  Learning's free source the sage's breast adorns  And poets not inglorious chant their loves  Boast favour'd Media boast thy flow'ry stores  Thy thousand hues by chymic suns refin'd  'Tis not the dress or mien my soul adores  'Tis the rich beauties of Britannia's mind  While Grenville's  Written about the time of Captain Grenville's death  breast could virtue's storesafford  What envy'd flota bore so fair a freight  The mine compar'd in vain its latent hoard  The gem its lustre and the gold its weight  Thee Grenville thee with calmest courage fraught  Thee the lov'd image of thy native shore  Thee by the Virtues arm'd the Graces taught  When shall we cease to boast or to deplore  Presumptuous War which could thy life destroy  What shall it now in recompense decree  While friends that merit ev'ry earthly joy  Feel ev'ry anguish feelthe loss of thee  Bid me no more a servile realm compare  No more the Muse of partial praise arraign  Britannia sees no foreign breast so fair  And if she glory glories not in vain  ELEGY XV In memory of a private family  The Penns of Harborough a place whose name in the Saxon language alludes to an army and there is a tradition that there was a battle fought on the Downs adjoining betwixt the Britons and the Romans  in Worcestershire  FROM a lone tow'r with rev'rend ivy crown'd  The pealing bell awak'd a tender sigh  Still as the village caught the waving sound  A swelling tear distream'd from ev'ry eye  So droop'd I ween each Briton's breast of old  When the dull curfew

monsters plough the main  " Here the dire locusts' horrid swarms prevail  " Here the blue asps with livid poison swell  " Here the dry dipsa writhes his sinuous mail  " Can we not here secure from envy dwell  " When the grim lion urg'd his cruel chase  " When the stern panther sought his midnight prey  " What fate reserv'd me for this Christian race  Spoke by a savage    " O race more polish'd more severe than they  " Ye prouling Wolves pursue my latest cries  " Thou hungry Tyger leave thy reeking den  " Ye sandy Wastes in rapid eddies rise  " O tear me from the whips and scorns of men  " Yet in their face superior beauty glows  " Are smiles the mien of Rapine and of Wrong  " Yet from their lip the voice of mercy flows  " And ev'n religion dwells upon their tongue  " Of blissful haunts

hopeless of those fertile plains  " Rich by our toils and by our sorrows gay  " They ply our labours and enchance our pains  " And feign these distant regions to repay  " For them our tusky elephant expires  " For them we drain the mine's embowell'd gold  " Where rove the brutal nations' wild desires  " Our limbs are purchas'd and our life is sold  " Yet shores there are bless'd shores for us remain  " And favour'd isles with golden fruitage crown'd  " Where tufted flow'rets paint the verdant plain  " Where ev'ry breeze shall med'cine ev'ry wound  " There the stern tyrant that embitters life  " Shall vainly suppliant spread his asking hand  " There shall we view the billows' raging strife  " Aid the kind breast and waft his boat to land"  ELEGY XXI Taking a view of the country from

Muse and me  Or 'mid the rural shepherds flow my days  Amid the rural shepherds I am free  To view sleek vassals crowd a stately hall  Say should I grow myself a solemn slave  To find thy tints O Titian grace my wall  Forego the flow'ry fields my fortune gave  Lord of my time my devious path I bend  Thro' fringy woodland or smoothshaven lawn  Or pensile grove or airy cliff ascend  And hail the scene by Nature's pencil drawn  Thanks be to Fatetho' nor the racy vine  Nor fatt'ning olive clothe the fields I rove  Sequester'd shades and gurgling founts are mine  And ev'ry silvan grot the Muses love  Here if my vista point the mould'ring pile  Where hood and cowl Devotion's aspect wore  I trace the tott'ring reliques with a smile  To think the mental bondage is no more  Pleas'd if the glowing landscape wave with corn  Or the tall oaks my country's bulwark rise  Pleas'd if mine eye o'er thousand vallies borne  Discern the Cambrian hills support the skies  And see Plinlimmon ev'n the youthful sight  Scales the proud hill's ethereal cliffs with pain  Such CaerCaradoc thy stupendous height  Whose ample shade obscures th' Iernian main  Bleak joyless regions where by Science fir'd  Some prying sage his lonely step may bend  There by the love of novel plants inspir'd  Invidious view the clamb'ring goats ascend  Yet for those mountains clad with lasting snow  The freeborn Briton left his greenest mead  Receding sullen from his mightier foe  For here he saw fair Liberty recede  Then if a chief perform'd a patriot's part  Sustain'd her drooping sons repell'd her foes  Above or Persian luxe or Attic art  The rude majestic monument arose  Progressive ages caroll'd forth his fame  Sires to his praise attun'd their children's tongue  The hoary Druid fed the gen'rous flame  While in such strains the rev'rend wizard sung  " Go forth my Sonsfor what is vital breath  " Your gods expell'd your liberty resign'd  " Go forth my Sonsfor what is instant death  " To souls secure perennial joys to find  " For scenes there are unknown to war or pain  " Where drops the balm that heals a tyrant's wound  " Where patriots bless'd with boundless freedom reign  " With misletoe's mysterious garlands crown'd  " Such are the names that grace your mystic songs  " Your solemn woods resound their martial fire  " To you my Sons the ritual meed belongs  " If in the cause you vanquish or expire  " Hark from the sacred oak that crowns the groves  " What awful voice my raptur'd bosom warms  " This is the favour'd moment Heav'n approves  " Sound the shrill trump this instant sound to arms"  Theirs was the science of a martial race  To shape the lance or decorate the shield  Ev'n the fair virgin stain'd her native grace  To give new horrors to the tented field  Now for some cheek where guilty blushes glow  For some false Florimel's impure disguise  The listed youth nor War's loud signal know  Nor Virtue's call nor Fame's imperial prize  Then if soft concord lull'd their fears to sleep  Inert and silent slept the manly car  But rush'd horrific o'er the fearful steep  If Freedom's awful clarion breath'd to war  Now the sleek courtier indolent and vain  Thron'd in the splendid carriage glides supine  To taint his virtue with a foreign strain  Or at a fav'rite's board his faith resign  Leave then O Luxury this happy soil  Chase her Britannia to some hostile shore  Or fleece the baneful pest with annual spoil  Alludes to a tax upon luxury then in debate    And let thy virtuous offspring weep no more  ELEGY XXII Written in the year when the rights of sepulture were so frequently violated  SAY gentle Sleep that lov'st the gloom of night  Parent of dreams thou great Magician say  Whence my late vision thus endures the light  Thus haunts my fancy thro' the glare of day  The silent moon had scal'd the vaulted skies  And anxious Care resign'd my limbs to rest  A sudden lustre struck my wond'ring eyes  And Silvia stood before my couch confest  Ah not the nymph so blooming and so gay  That led the dance beneath the festive shade  But she that in the morning of her day  Entomb'd beneath the grassgreen sod was laid  No more her eyes their wonted radiance cast  No more her breast inspir'd the lover's flame  No more her cheek the Paestan rose surpast  Yet seem'd her lip's ethereal smile the same  Nor such her hair as deck'd her living face  Nor such her voice as charm'd the list'ning crowd  Nor such her dress as heighten'd ev'ry grace  Alas all vanish'd for the mournful shroud  Yet seem'd her lip's ethereal charm the same  That dear distinction ev'ry doubt remov'd  Perish the lover whose imperfect flame  Forgets one feature of the nymph he lov'd  " Damon" she said "mine hour allotted flies  " Oh do not waste it with a fruitless tear  " Tho' griev'd to see thy Silvia's pale disguise  " Suspend thy sorrow and attentive hear  " So may thy Muse with virtuous fame be blest  " So be thy love with mutual love repaid  " So may thy bones in sacred silence rest  " Fast by the reliques of some happier maid  " Thou know'st how ling'ring on a distant shore  " Disease invidious nipt my flow'ry prime  " And oh what pangs my tender bosom tore  " To think I ne'er must view my native clime  " No friend was near to raise my drooping head  " No dear companion wept to see me die  " Lodge me within my native soil I said  " There my fond parents' honour'd reliques lie  " Tho' now debarr'd of each domestic tear  " Unknown forgot I meet the fatal blow  " There many a friend shall grace my woeful bier  " And many a sigh shall rise and tear shall flow  " I spoke nor Fate forebore his trembling spoil  " Some venal mourner lent his careless aid  " And soon they bore me to my native soil  " Where my fond parents' dear remains were laid  " 'Twas then the youths from ev'ry plain and grove  " Adorn'd with mournful verse thy Silvia's bier  " 'Twas then the Nymphs their votive garlands wove  " And strew'd the fragrance of the youthful year  " But why alas the tender scene display  " Could Damon's foot the pious path decline  " Ah no 'twas Damon first attun'd his lay  " And sure no sonnet was so dear as thine  " Thus was I bosom'd in the peaceful grave  " My placid ghost no longer wept its doom  " When savage robbers ev'ry sanction brave  " And with outrageous guilt defraud the tomb  " Shall my poor corse from hostile realms convey'd  " Lose the cheap portion of my native sands  " Or in my kindred's dear embraces laid  " Mourn the vile ravage of barbarian hands  " Say would thy breast no deathlike torture feel  " To see my limbs the felon's gripe obey  " To see them gash'd beneath the daring steel  " To crowds a spectre and to dogs a prey  " If Paean's sons these horrid rites require  " If Health's fair science be by these refin'd  " Let guilty convicts for their use expire  " And let their breathless corse avail mankind  " Yet hard it seems when Guilt's last fine is paid  " To see the victim's corse deny'd repose  " Now more severe the poor offenceless maid  " Dreads the dire outrage of inhuman foes  " Where is the faith of ancient Pagans fled  " Where the fond care the wand'ring manes claim  " Nature instinctive cries Protect the dead  " And sacred be their ashes and their fame  " Arise dear Youth ev'n now the danger calls  " Ev'n now the villain snuffs his wonted prey  " See see I lead thee to you' sacred

nor Salkeld he regards  But gets into the House  And soon a judge's rank rewards  His pliant votes and bows  Adieu ye Bobs ye Bags give place  Full bottoms come instead  Good Ld to see the various ways  Of dressing a calf's head  THE PROGRESS OF ADVICE A COMMON CASE  Suade nam certum est  EXPLANATION  Advise it for 'tis fix'd  SAYS Richard to Thomas and seem'd half afraid  " I am thinking to marry thy mistress's maid  " Now because Mrs Lucy to thee is well known  " I will do't if thou bidd'st me or let it alone  " Nay don't male a jest on't 'tis no jest to me  " For 'faith I'm in earnest so prithee be free  " I have no fault to find with the girl since I knew her  " But I'd have thy advice ere I tie myself to her"  Said Thomas to Richard "To speak my opinion  " There is not such a bitch in King George's dominion  " And I firmly believe if thou knew'st her as I do  " Thou wouldst chuse out a whippingpost first to be ty'd to  " She's peevish she's thievish she's ugly she's old  " And a liar and a fool and a slut and a scold"  Next day Richard hasten'd to church and was wed  And ere night had inform'd her what Thomas had said  SLENDER'S GHOST VIDE SHAKESPEARE  BENEATH a churchyard yew  Decay'd and worn with age  At dusk of eve methought I spy'd  Poor Slender's Ghost that whimp'ring cry'd  " O sweet O sweet Anne Page"  Ye gentle Bards give ear  Who talk of am'rous rage  Who spoil the lily rob the rose  Come learn of me to weep your woes  " O sweet O sweet Anne Page"  Why should such labour'd strains  Your formal Muse engage  I never dream'd of flame or dart  That fir'd my breast or pierc'd my heart  But sigh'd "O sweet Anne Page"  And you whose lovesick minds  No med'cine can assuage  Accuse the leech's art no more  But learn of Slender to deplore  " O sweet O sweet Anne Page"  And ye whose souls are held  Like linnets in a cage  Who talk of fetters links and chains  Attend and imitate my strains  " O sweet O sweet Anne Page"  And you who boast or grieve  What horrid wars ye wage  Of wounds receiv'd from many an eye  Yet mean as I do when I sigh  " O sweet O sweet Anne Page"  Hence ev'ry fond conceit  Of shepherd or of sage  'Tis Slender's voice 'tis Slender's way  Expresses all you have to say  " O sweet O sweet Anne Page"  THE INVIDIOUS  MART  O FORTUNE if my pray'r of old  Was ne'er solicitous for gold  With better grace thou may'st allow  My suppliant wish that asks it now  Yet think not Goddess I require it  For the same end your clowns desire it  In a wellmade effectual string  Fain would I see Lividio swing  Hear him from Tyburn's height haranguing  But such a cur's not worth one's hanging  Give me O Goddess store of pelf  And he will tie the knot himself  THE PRICE OF AN EQUIPAGE  Servum si potes Ole non habere  Et regem potes Ole non habere  MART  " If thou from Fortune dost no servant crave  " Believe me thou no master need'st to have"  I ASK'D a friend amidst the throng  Whose coach it was that trail'd along  " The gilded coach theredon't ye mind  " That with the footmen stuck behind"  " O Sir" says he "what han't you seen it  " 'Tis Damon's coach and Damon in it  " 'Tis odd methinks you have forgot  " Your friend your neighbour andwhat not  " Your old acquaintance Damon""True  " But faith his Equipage is new"  " Bless me" said I "where can it end  " What madness has possess'd my friend  " Four powder'd slaves and those the tallest  " Their stomachs doubtless not the smallest  " Can Damon's revenue maintain  " In lace and food so large a train  " I know his landeach inch o' ground  " 'Tis not a mile to walk it round  " If Damon's whole estate can bear  " To keep his lad and onehorse chair  " I own 'tis past my comprehension"  " Yes Sir but Damon has a pension"  Thus does a false ambition rule us  Thus pomp delude and folly fool us  To keep a race of flick'ring knaves  He grows himself the worst of slaves  HINT FROM VOITURE  LET Sol his annual journies run  And when the radiant task is done  Confess thro' all the globe 'twould pose him  To match the charms that Celia shows him  And should he boast he once had seen  As just a form as bright a mien  Yet must it still for ever pose him  To matchwhat Celia never shows him  INSCRIPTION  To the memory  Of A L Esquire  Justice of the peace for this county  Who in the whole course of his pilgrimage  Thro' a trifling ridiculous world  Maintaining his proper dignity  Notwithstanding the scoffs of illdispos'd persons  And wits of the age  That ridicul'd his behaviour  Or censur'd his breeding  Following the dictates of Nature  Desiring to ease the afflicted  Eager to set the prisoners at liberty  Without having for his end  The noise or report such things generally cause  In the world  As he was seen to perform them of none  But the sole relief and happiness  Of the party in distress  Himself resting easy  When he could render that so  Not griping or pinching himself  To hoard up superfluities  Not coveting to keep in his possession  What gives more disquietude than pleasure  But charitably diffusing it  To all round about him  Making the most sorrowful countenance  To smile  In his presence  Always bestowing more than he was ask'd  Always imparting before he was desir'd  Not proceeding in this manner  Upon every trivial suggestion  But the most mature and solemn deliberation  With an incredible presence and undauntedness  Of mind  With an inimitable gravity and economy  Of face  Bidding loud defiance  To politeness and the fashion  Dar'd let a ft  TO A FRIEND  HAVE you ne'er seen my gentle Squire  The humours of your kitchen fire  Says Ned to Sal "I lead a spade  " Why don't ye playthe girl's afraid  " Play somethingany thingbut play  " 'Tis but to pass the time away  " Phoohow she standsbiting her nails  " As tho' she play'd for half her vails  " Sorting her cards hagling and picking  " We play for nothing do us Chicken  " That card will do'blood never doubt it  " Its not worth while to think about it"  Sal thought and thought and miss'd her aim  And Ned ne'er studying won the game  Methinks old Friend 'tis wondrous true  That verse is but a game at loo  While many a bard that shews so clearly  He writes for his amusement merely  Is known to study fret and toil  And play for nothing all the while  Or praise at most for wreaths of yore  Ne'er signify'd a farthing more  Till having vainly toil'd to gain it  He sees your flying pen obtain it  Thro' fragrant scenes the trifler roves  And hallow'd haunts that Phoebus loves  Where with strange heats his bosom glows  And mystic flames the god bestows  You now none other flame require  Than a good blazing parlour fire  Write versesto defy the scorners  In shithouses and chimneycorners  Sal found her deeplaid schemes were vain  The cards are cutcome deal again  No good comes on it when one lingers  I'll play the cards come next my fingers  Fortune could never let Ned loo her  When she had left it wholly to her  Well now who winswhy still the same  For Sal has lost another game  " I've done she mutter'd I was saying  " It did not argufy my playing  " Some folks will win they cannot chuse  " But think or not thinksome must lose  " I may have won a game or so  " But then it was an age ago  " It ne'er will be my lot again  " I won it of a baby then  " Give me an ace of trumps and see  " Our Ned will beat me with a three  " 'Tis all by luck that things are carry'd  " He'll suffer for it when he's marry'd"  Thus Sal with tears in either eye  While victor Ned sate titt'ring by  Thus I long envying your success  And bent to write and study less  Sate down and scribbled in a trice  Just what you seeand you despise  You who can frame a tuneful song  And hum it as you ride along  And trotting on the king's highway  Snatch from the hedge a sprig of bay  Accept this verse howe'er it flows  From one that is your friend in prose  What is this wreath so green so fair  Which many wish and few must wear  Which some men's indolence can gain  And some men's vigils ne'er obtain  For what must Sal or poet sue  Ere they engage with Ned or you  For luck in verse for luck at loo  Ah no 'tis genius gives you fame  And Ned thro' skill secures the game  THE POET AND THE DUN    These are messengers  That feelingly persuade me what I am  SHAKESPEARE  COMES a Dun in the morning and raps at my door  " I made bold to call'tis a twelvemonth and more  " I'm sorry believe me to trouble you thus Sir  " But Job would be paid Sir had Job been a mercer"  My friend have but patience"Ay these are your ways"  I have got but one shilling to serve me two days  But Sirprithee take it and tell your attorney  If I ha'n't paid your bill I have paid for your journey  Well now thou art gone let me govern my passion  And calmly considerConsider vexation  What whore that must paint and must put on false locks  And counterfeit joy in the pangs of the pox  What beggar's wife's nephew now starv'd and now beaten  Who wanting to eat fears himself shall be eaten  What porter what turnspit can deem his case hard  Or what Dun boast of patience that thinks of a Bard  Well I'll leave this poor trade for no trade can be poorer  Turn shoeboy or courtier or pimp or procurer  Get love and respect and good living and pelf  And dun some poor dog of a poet myself  One's credit however of course will grow better  Here enters the footman and brings me a letter  " Dear Sir I receiv'd your obliging epistle  " Your fame is securebid the critics go whistle  " I read over with wonder the poem you sent me  " And I must speak your praises no soul shall prevent me  " The audience believe me cry'd out ev'ry line  " Was strong was affecting was just was divine  " All pregnant as gold is with worth weight and beauty  " And to hide such a genius wasfar from your duty  " I foresee that the court will be hugely delighted  " Sir Richard for much a less genius was knighted  " Adieu my good Friend and for high life prepare ye  " I could say much more but you're modest I spare ye"  Quite fir'd with the flatt'ry I call for my paper  And waste that and health and my time and my taper  I scribble 'till morn when with wrath no small store  Comes my old friend the mercer and raps at my door  " Ah Friend 'tis but idle to make such a pother  " Fate Fate has ordain'd us to plague one another"  WRITTEN AT AN INN AT HENLEY  To thee fair Freedom I retire  From flatt'ry cards and dice and din  Nor art thou found in mansions higher  Than the low cot or humble Inn  'Tis here with boundless pow'r I reign  And ev'ry health which I begin  Converts dull Port to bright Champaigne  Such freedom crowns it at an Inn  I fly from pomp I fly from plate  I fly from Falsehood's specious grin  Freedom I love and form I hate  And chuse my lodgings at an Inn  Here Waiter take my sordid ore  Which lackies else might hope to win  It buys what courts have not in store  It buys me freedom at an Inn  Whoe'er has travell'd life's dull round  Where'er his stages may have been  May sigh to think he still has found  The warmest welcome at an Inn  A SIMILE  WHAT village but has sometimes seen  The clumsy shape the frightful mien  Tremendous claws and shagged hair  Of that grim brute yclep'd a bear  He from his dam the learn'd agree  Receiv'd the curious form you see  Who with her plastic tongue alone  Produc'd a visagelike her own  And thus they hint in mystic fashion  The pow'rful force of education  Of a fond matron's education    Perhaps yon' crowd of swains is viewing  Ev'n now the strange exploits of Bruin  Who plays his antics roars aloud  The wonder of a gaping crowd  So have I known an awkward lad  Whose birth has made a parish glad  Forbid for fear of sense to roam  And taught by kind mamma at home  Who gives him many a welltry'd rule  With ways and meansto play the fool  In sense the same in stature higher  He shines ere long a rural squire  Pours forth unwitty jokes and swears  And bawls and drinks but chiefly stares  His tenants of superior sense  Carouse and laugh at his expense  And deem the pastime I'm relating  To be as pleasant as bearbaiting  THE CHARMS OF PRECEDENCE A TALE  " SIR will you please to walk before"  " No pray Siryou are next the door"  " Upon mine honour I'll not stir"  " Sir I'm at home consider Sir"  " Excuse me Sir I'll not go first"  " Well if I must be rude I must  " But yet I wish I could evade it  " 'Tis strangely clownish be persuaded"  Go forward Cits go forward Squires  Nor scruple each what each admires  Life squares not Friends with your proceeding  It flies while you display your breeding  Such breeding as one's granam preaches  Or some old dancingmaster teaches  O for some rude tumultuous fellow  Half crazy or at least half mellow  To come behind you unawares  And fairly push you both down stairs  But Death's at handlet me advise ye  Go forward Friends or he'll surprise ye  Besides how insincere you are  Do ye not flatter lie forswear  And daily cheat and weekly pray  And all for thisto lead the way  Such is my theme which means to prove  That tho' we drink or game or love  As that or this is most in fashion  Precedence is our ruling passion  When collegestudents take degrees  And pay the beadle's endless fees  What moves that scientific body  But the first cutting at a gaudy  And whence such shoals in bare conditions  That starve and languish as physicians  Content to trudge the streets and stare at  The fat apothecary's chariot  But that in Charlotte's chamber see  Moliere's  Medicin malgre lui    The leech howe'er his fortunes vary  Still walks before th' apothecary  Flavia in vain has wit and charms  And all that shines and all that warms  In vain all human race adore her  ForLady Mary ranks before her  O Celia gentle Celia tell us  You who are neither vain nor jealous  The softest breast the mildest mien  Would you not feel some little spleen  Nor bite your lip nor furl your brow  If Florimel your equal now  Should one day gain precedence of ye  First serv'dtho' in a dish of coffee  Plac'd first altho' where you are found  You gain the eyes of all around  Nam'd first tho' not with half the fame  That waits my charming Celia's name  Hard fortune barely to inspire  Our fix'd esteem and fond desire  Barely where'er you go to prove  The source of universal love  Yet be content observing this  Honour's the offspring of caprice  And worth howe'er you have pursu'd it  Has now no pow'rbut to exclude it  You'll find your gen'ral reputation  A kind of supplemental station  Poor Swift with all his worth could ne'er  He tells us hope to rise a peer  So to supply it wrote for fame  And well the wit secur'd his aim  A common patriot has a drift  Not quite so innocent as Swift  In Britain's cause he rants he labours  " He's honest faith"Have patience Neighbours  For patriots may sometimes deceive  May beg their friends' reluctant leave  To serve them in a higher sphere  And drop their virtue to get there  As Lucian tells us in his fashion  How souls put off each earthly passion  Ere on Elysium's flow'ry strand  Old Charon suffer'd 'em to land  So ere we meet a court's caresses  No doubt our souls must change their dresses  And souls there be who bound that way  Attire themselves ten times aday  If then 'tis rank which all men covet  And saints alike and sinners love it  If place for which our courtiers throng  So thick that few can get along  For which such servile toils are seen  Who's happier than a kinga queen  Howe'er men aim at elevation  'Tis properly a female passion  Women and beaus beyond all measure  Are charm'd with rank's ecstatic pleasure  Sir if your drift I rightly scan  You'd hint a beau were not a man  Say women then are fond of places  I wave all disputable cases  A man perhaps would something linger  Were his lov'd rank to costa finger  Or were an ear or toe the price on't  He might delib'rate once or twice on't  Perhaps ask Gataker's advice on't  And many as their frame grows old  Would hardly purchase it with gold  But women wish Precedence ever  'Tis their whole life's supreme endeavour  It fires their youth with jealous rage  And strongly animates their age  Perhaps they would not sell outright  Or maim a limbthat was in sight  Yet on worse terms they sometimes chuse it  Nor ev'n in punishments refuse it  Preeminence in pain you cry  All fierce and pregnant with reply  But lend your patience and your ear  An argument shall make it clear  But hold an argument may fail  Beside my title says A Tale  Where Avon rolls her winding stream  Avon the Muses' fav'rite theme  Avon that fills the farmers' purses  And decks with flow'rs both farms and verses  She visits many a fertile vale  Such was the scene of this my Tale  For 'tis in Ev'sham's Vale or near it  That folks with laughter tell and hear it  The soil with annual plenty bless'd  Was by young Corydon possess'd  His youth alone I lay before ye  As most material to my story  For strength and vigour too he had 'em  And 'twere not much amiss to add 'em  Thrice happy lout whose wide domain  Now green with grass now gilt with grain  In russet robes of clover deep  Or thinly veil'd and white with sheep  Now fragrant with the bean's perfume  Now purpled with the pulse's bloom  Might well with bright allusion store me  But happier bards have been before me  Amongst the various year's increase  The stripling own'd a field of pease  Which when at night he ceas'd his labours  Were haunted by some female neighbours  Each morn discover'd to his sight  The shameful havoc of the night  Traces of this they left behind 'em  But no instructions where to find 'em  The devil's works are plain and evil  But few or none have seen the devil  Old Noll indeed if we may credit  The words of Echard who has said it  Contriv'd with Satan how to fool us  And bargain'd face to face to rule us  But then Old Noll was one in ten  And sought him more than other men  Our shepherd too with like attention  May meet the female fiends we mention  He rose one morn at break of day  And near the field in ambush lay  When lo a brace of girls appears  The third a matron much in years  Smiling amidst the pease the sinners  Sate down to cull their future dinners  And caring little who might own 'em  Made free as tho' themselves had fown 'em  'Tis worth a sage's observation  How love can make a jest of passion  Anger had forc'd the swain from bed  His early dues to love unpaid  And Love a god that keeps a pother  And will be paid one time or other  Now banish'd Anger out o' door  And claim'd the debt withheld before  If Anger bid our youth revile  Love form'd his features to a smile  And knowing well 'twas all grimace  To threaten with a smiling face  He in few words express'd his mind  And none would deem them much unkind  The am'rous youth for their offence  Demanded instant recompense  That recompense from each which shame  Forbids a bashful Muse to name  Yet more this sentence to discover  'Tis what Bett ** grants her lover  When he to make the strumpet willing  Has spent his fortuneto a shilling  Each stood a while as 'twere suspended  And loath to do whateach intended  At length with soft pathetic sighs  The matron bent with age replies  " 'Tis vain to strivejustice I know  " And our ill stars will have it so  " But let my tears your wrath assuage  " And shew some deference for age  " I from a distant village came  " Am old G knows and something lame  " And if we yield as yield we must  " Dispatch my crazy body first"  Our shepherd like the Phrygian swain  When circled round on Ida's plain  With goddesses he stood suspended  And Pallas's grave speech was ended  Own'd what she ask'd might be his duty  But paid the compliment to beauty  EPILOGUE TO THE TRAGEDY OF CLEONE  WELL Ladiesso much for the tragic style  And now the custom is to make you smile  To make us smilemethinks I hear you say  Why who can help it at so strange a play  The captain gone three yearsand then to blame  The faultless conduct of his virtuous dame  My starswhat gentle belle would think it treason  When thus provok'd to give the brute some reason  Out of my housethis night forsooth depart  A modern wife had said"With all my heart  " But think not haughty Sir I'll go alone  " Order your coachconduct me safe to Town  " Give me my jewels wardrobe and my maid  " And pray take care my pinmoney be paid"  Such is the language of each modish fair  Yet memoirs not of modern growth declare  The time has been when modesty and truth  Were deem'd additions to the charms of youth  When women hid their necks and veil'd their faces  Nor romp'd nor rak'd nor star'd at public places  Nor took the airs of Amazons for graces  Then plain domestic virtues were the mode  And wives ne'er dream'd of happiness abroad  They lov'd their children learn'd no flaunting airs  But with the joys of wedlock mix'd the cares  Those times are pastyet sure they merit praise  For marriage triumph'd in those golden days  By chaste decorum they affection gain'd  By faith and fondness what they won maintain'd  'Tis yours ye Fair to bring those days a gen  And form anew the hearts of thoughtless men  Make beauty's lustre amiable as bright  And give the soul as well as sense delight  Reclaim from folly a fantastic age  That soorns the press the pulpit and the stage  Let truth and tenderness your breasts adorn  The marriage chain with transport shall be worn  Each blooming virgin rais'd into a bride  Shall double all their joys their cares divide  Alleviate grief compose the jars of strife  And pour the balm that sweetens human life  A PASTORAL ODE TO THE HONOURABLE SIR RICHARD LYTTLETON  THE morn dispens'd a dubious light  A sullen mist had stolen from sight  Each pleasing vale and hill  When Damon left his humble bowers  To guard his flocks to fence his flowers  Or check his wand'ring rill  Tho' school'd from Fortune's paths to fly  The swain beneath each low'ring sky  Would oft' his fate bemoan  That he in sylvan shades forlorn  Must waste his cheerless ev'n and morn  Nor prais'd nor lov'd nor known  No friend to Fame's obstrep'rous noise  Yet to the whispers of her voice  Soft murm'ring not a foe  The pleasures he thro' choice declin'd  When gloomy fogs depress'd his mind  It griev'd him to forego  Griev'd him to lurk the lakes beside  Where coots in rushy dingles hide  And moorcocks shun the day  While caitiff bitterns undismay'd  Remark the swain's familiar shade  And scorn to quit their prey  But see the radiant sun once more  The bright'ning face of heav'n restore  And raise the doubtful dawn  And more to gild his rural sphere  At once the brightest train appear  That ever trod the lawn  Amazement chill'd the shepherd's frame  To think Bridgewater's  The Duchess of Bridgewater married to Sir Richard Lyttleton  honour'd name  Should grace his rustic cell  That she on all whose motions wait  Distinction titles rank and state  Should rove where shepherds dwell  But true it is the gen'rous mind  By candour sway'd by taste refin'd  Will nought but vice disdain  Nor will the breast where fancy glows  Deem every flower a weed that blows  Amid the desert plain  Beseems it such with honour crown'd  To deal its lucid beams around  Nor equal meed receive  At most such garlands from the field  As cowslips pinks and pansies yield  And rural hands can weave  Yet strive ye Shepherds strive to find  And weave the fairest of the kind  The prime of all the spring  If haply thus yon' lovely fair  May round her temples deign to wear  The trivial wreaths you bring  O how the peaceful halcyons play'd  Where'er the conscious lake betray'd  Athenia's placid mien  How did the sprightlier linnets throng  Where Paphia's charms requir'd the song  'Mid hazel copses green  Lo Dartmouth on those banks reclin'd  While busy Fancy calls to mind  The glories of his line  Methinks my cottage rears its head  The ruin'd walls of yonder shed  As thro' enchantment shine  But who the nymph that guides their way  Could ever nymph descend to stray  From Hagley's fam'd retreat  Else by the blooming features fair  The faultless make the matchless air  'Twere Cynthia's form complete  So would some tuberose delight  That struck the pilgrim's wond'ring sight  'Mid lonely deserts drear  All as at eve the sov'reign flower  Dispenses round its balmy power  And crowns the fragrant year  Ah now no more the shepherd cry'd  Must I Ambition's charms deride  Her subtle force disown  No more of Fauns or Fairies dream  While Fancy near each crystal stream  Shall paint these forms alone  By lowbrow'd rock or pathless mead  I deem'd that splendour ne'er should lead  My dazzled eyes astray  But who alas will dare contend  If beauty add or merit blend  Its more illustrious ray  Nor is it longO plaintive swain  Since Guernsey saw without disdain  Where hid in woodlands green  The partner of his early days  They were schoolfellows    And once the rival of his praise  Had stol'n thro' life unseen  Scarce faded is the vernal flower  Since Stamford left his honour'd bow'r  To smile familiar here  O form'd by Nature to disclose  How fair that courtesy which flows  From social warmth sincere  Nor yet have many moons decay'd  Since Pollio sought this lonely shade  Admir'd this rural maze  The noblest breast that Virtue fires  The Graces love the Muse inspires  Might pant for Pollio's praise  Say Thomson here was known to rest  For him yon' vernal seat I drest  Ah never to return  In place of wit and melting strains  And social mirth it now remains  To weep beside his urn  Come then my Lelius come once more  And fringe the melancholy shore  With roses and with bays  While I each wayward Fate accuse  That envy'd his impartial Muse  To sing your early praise  While Philo to whose favour'd sight  Antiquity with full delight  Her inmost wealth displays  Beneath yon' ruin's moulder'd wall  Shall muse and with his friend recall  The pomp of ancient days  Here too shall Conway's name appear  He prais'd the stream so lovely clear  That shone the reeds among  Yet clearness could it not disclose  To match the rhetoric that flows  From Conway's polish'd tongue  Ev'n Pitt whose fervent periods roll  Resistless thro' the kindling soul  Of senates councils kings  Tho' form'd for courts vouchsaf'd to rove  Inglorious thro' the shepherd's grove  And ope his bashful springs  But what can courts discover more  Than these rude haunts have seen before  Each fount and shady tree  Have not these trees and fountains seen  The pride of courts the winning mien  Of peerless Aylesbury  And Grenville she whose radiant eyes  Have mark'd by slow gradation rise  The princely piles of Stow  Yet prais'd these unembellish'd woods  And smil'd to see the babbling floods  Thro' selfworn mazes flow  Say Dartmouth who your banks admir'd  Again beneath your caves retir'd  Shall grace the pensive shade  With all the bloom with all the truth  With all the sprightliness of youth  By cool reflection sway'd  Brave yet humane shall Smith appear  Ye Sailors tho' his name be dear  Think him not yours alone  Grant him in other spheres to charm  The shepherds' breasts tho' mild are warm  And ours are all his own  O Lyttleton my honour'd guest  Could I describe thy gen'rous breast  Thy firm yet polish'd mind  How public love adorns thy name  How Fortune too conspires with Fame  The song should please mankind  A PASTORAL BALLAD IN FOUR PARTS Written    Arbusta humilesque myricae  VIRG  EXPLANATION  Groves and lowly shrubs  I ABSENCE  YE Shepherds so cheerful and gay  Whose flocks never carelessly roam  Should Corydon's happen to stray  Oh call the poor wanderers home  Allow me to muse and to sigh  Nor talk of the change that ye find  None once was so watchful as I  I have left my dear Phyllis behind  Now I know what it is to have strove  With the torture of doubt and desire  What it is to admire and to love  And to leave her we love and admire  Ah lead forth my flock in the morn  And the damps of each ev'ning repel  Alas I am faint and forlorn  I have bade my dear Phyllis farewell  Since Phyllis vouchsaf'd me a look  I never once dream'd of my vine  May I lose both my pipe and my crook  If I knew of a kid that was mine  I priz'd ev'ry hour that went by  Beyond all that had pleas'd me before  But now they are past and I sigh  And I grieve that I priz'd them no more  But why do I languish in vain  Why wander thus pensively here  Oh why did I come from the plain  Where I fed on the smiles of my dear  They tell me my favourite maid  The pride of that valley is flown  Alas where with her I have stray'd  I could wander with pleasure alone  When forc'd the fair nymph to forego  What anguish I felt at my heart  Yet I thoughtbut it might not be so  'Twas with pain that she saw me depart  She gaz'd as I slowly withdrew  My path I could hardly discern  So sweetly she bade me adieu  I thought that she bade me return  The pilgrim that journeys all day  To visit some fardistant shrine  If he bear but a relique away  Is happy nor heard to repine  Thus widely remov'd from the fair  Where my vows my devotion I owe  Soft hope is the relique I bear  And my solace wherever I go  II HOPE  MY banks they are furnish'd with bees  Whose murmur invites one to sleep  My grottoes are shaded with trees  And my hills are whiteover with sheep  I seldom have met with a loss  Such health do my fountains bestow  My fountains all border'd with moss  Where the harebells and violets grow  Not a pine in my grove is there seen  But with tendrils of woodbine is bound  Not a beech's more beautiful green  But a sweetbriar entwines it around  Not my fields in the prime of the year  More charms than my cattle unfold  Not a brook that is limpid and clear  But it glitters with fishes of gold  One would think she might like to retire  To the bow'r I have labour'd to rear  Not a shrub that I heard her admire  But I hasted and planted it there  O how sudden the jessamine strove  With the lilac to render it gay  Already it calls for my love  To prune the wild branches away  From the plains from the woodlands and groves  What strains of wild melody flow  How the nightingales warble their loves  From thickets of roses that blow  And when her bright form shall appear  Each bird shall harmoniously join  In a concert so soft and so clear  Asshe may not be fond to resign  I have found out a gift for my fair  I have found where the woodpigeons breed  But let me that plunder forbear  She will say 'twas a barbarous deed  For he ne'er could be true she averr'd  Who could rob a poor bird of its young  And I lov'd her the more when I heard  Such tenderness fall from her tongue  I have heard her with sweetness unfold  How that pity was due toa dove  That it ever attended the bold  And she call'd it the sister of Love  But her words such a pleasure convey  So much I her accents adore  Let her speak and whatever she say  Methinks I should love her the more  Can a bosom so gentle remain  Unmov'd when her Corydon sighs  Will a nymph that is fond of the plain  These plains and this valley despise  Dear regions of silence and shade  Soft scenes of contentment and ease  Where I could have pleasingly stray'd  If aught in her absence could please  But where does my Phyllida stray  And where are her grots and her bow'rs  Are the groves and the vallies as gay  And the shepherds as gentle as ours  The groves may perhaps be as fair  And the face of the vallies as fine  The swains may in manners compare  But their love is not equal to mine  III SOLICITUDE  WHY will you my passion reprove  Why term it a folly to grieve  Ere I shew you the charms of my love  She is fairer than you can believe  With her mien she enamours the brave  With her wit she engages the free  With her modesty pleases the grave  She is ev'ry way pleasing to me  O you that have been of her train  Come and join in my amorous lays  I could lay down my life for the swain  That will sing but a song in her praise  When he sings may the nymphs of the town  Come trooping and listen the while  Nay on him let not Phyllida frown  But I cannot allow her to smile  For when Paridel tries in the dance  Any favour with Phyllis to find  O how with one trivial glance  Might she ruin the peace of my mind  In ringlets he dresses his hair  And his crook is bestudded around  And his pipeoh may Phyllis beware  Of a magic there is in the sound  'Tis his with mock passion to glow  'Tis his in smooth tales to unfold  " How her face is as bright as the snow  " And her bosom be sure is as cold  " How the nightingales labour the strain  " With the notes of his charmer to vie  " How they vary their accents in vain  " Repine at her triumphs and die"  To the grove or the garden he strays  And pillages every sweet  Then suiting the wreath to his lays  He throws it at Phyllis's feet  " O Phyllis" he whispers "more fair  " More sweet than the jessamine's flow'r  " What are pinks in a morn to compare  " What is eglantine after a show'r  " Then the lily no longer is white  " Then the rose is depriv'd of its bloom  " Then the violets die with despight  " And the woodbines give up their perfume"  Thus glide the soft numbers along  And he fancies no shepherd his peer  Yet I never should envy the song  Were not Phyllis to lend it an ear  Let his crook be with hyacinths bound  So Phyllis the trophy despise  Let his forehead with laurels be crown'd  So they shine not in Phyllis's eyes  The language that flows from the heart  Is a stranger to Paridel's tongue  Yet may she beware of his art  Or sure I must envy the song  IV DISAPPOINTMENT  YE Shepherds give ear to my lay  And take no more heed of my sheep  They have nothing to do but to stray  I have nothing to do but to weep  Yet do not my folly reprove  She was fairand my passion begun  She smil'dand I could not but love  She is faithlessand I am undone  Perhaps I was void of all thought  Perhaps it was plain to foresee  That a nymph so complete would be sought  By a swain more engaging than me  Ah love ev'ry hope can inspire  It banishes wisdom the while  And the lip of the nymph we admire  Seems for ever adorn'd with a smile  She is faithless and I am undone  Ye that witness the woes I endure  Let reason instruct you to shun  What it cannot instruct you to cure  Beware how you loiter in vain  Amid nymphs of an higher degree  It is not for me to explain  How fair and how fickle they be  Alas from the day that we met  What hope of an end to my woes  When I cannot endure to forget  The glance that undid my repose  Yet time may diminish the pain  The flow'r and the shrub and the tree  Which I rear'd for her pleasure in vain  In time may have comfort for me  The sweets of a dewsprinkled rose  The sound of a murmuring stream  The peace which from solitude flows  Henceforth shall be Corydon's theme  High transports are shewn to the sight  But we are not to find them our own  Fate never bestow'd such delight  As I with my Phyllis had known  O ye Woods spread your branches apace  To your deepest recesses I fly  I would hide with the beasts of the chase  I would vanish from every eye  Yet my reed shall resound thro' the grove  With the same sad complaint it begun  How she smil'd and I could not but love  Was faithless and I am undone  CONTENTS  PREFACE giving a brief account of the Author Page  A prefatory Essay on Elegy  Advertisement  A Description of the Leasowes the Author's
