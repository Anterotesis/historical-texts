 SOP IN THE PAN FOR PETER PINDAR ESQ OR A LATE INVITATION TO CHELTENHAM A BURLESQUE POEM  BY PINDAROMASTIX  LONDON PRINTED FOR G G J AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTERROW  MDCCLXXXVIII  TO THE PUBLIC  SOME apology may be required for my making so free with an old favourite of yours So many of you as are in the habit of admiring the  sublime performances  of our English Pindar will do doubt exclaim against me for assigning a post at Court the most humiliating of all others to your darling Poet But this is the very thing I intended for this favourite of yours like many other favourites has been spoiled by too much indulgence and is grown so intolerably saucy that he ought to be taken down a little But there may be others among you who will acknowledge P Pindar to be fair game and who may say that this gentle castigation is not half so much as he deserves for that impudent mockery and caricature which he has so often pointed at his Sn To all such it may not be amiss to intimate that I have another birch in soak for Master Peter which I think will give him a smart flagellation The few lines which I now hazard the publication of are only meant as preparatory to the introduction of this other labour of my sportive Muse provided that I find this my first essay is tolerably well received and that it is acknowledged to be of sufficient merit to intitle me in some small degree to the signaâˆ£ture of  PINDAROMASTIX  SOP IN THE PAN c  HAIL funny Bard of neverceasing lay  To Chelt'nham's fav'rite fountain speed thy way  Where'er thy commons be and mimic joke  Whether with guzzling cits 'midst London smoke  Or far remov'd to thy own native moors  With Cornish tinners 'squires or hugging boors  Or whether thou'rt still at thy old fav'rite sport  Eavesdropping slily at St James's Court  To catch another Kitchen Tale  In Ode Pindaric to retail  Where'er this friendly call may find thee  Quick mount thy Pegasus and take thy muse behind thee  Not winged Pegasus in Poet's Fable  But hackney Pegasus in liv'ry stable  And whilst thou'rt jogging on the turnpike road  Set all thy brains at work to hatch a merry Ode  To tickle thy lov'd King  At Chelt'nham's purging spring  So shall thy Muse the royal favour gain  And give thee rank among the courtly train  That rank for which sure Fate and Nature fram'd thee  Since neither stocks nor pillory has claim'd thee  Yes witty Peter  Thy merry metre  If right I ween will very soon  Exalt thee to be Court Buffoon  With title and with pension  And all that thou canst wish or mention  No more Pindaric Ballads shalt thou sing  Which poor precarious scanty dinner bring  To meagre Poetaster  But pamper'd courtly songster shalt thou be  Of jolly plight and full of heartfelt glee  The darling of thy Master  Thus when the Kg  From Chelt'nham spring  To Cloacina's temple shall repair  To pour the due libation  His funny fav'rite only shall attend him there  To help the operation  Nor faithless thou this presage deem  Delusive sport of Poet's dream  For whilst thy brother Bard of late  On Cloacina's tripod sat  My fancy wand'ring to and fro  I heard these accents rumble in the vault below  "Haste thee Bard of funny lay  "Peter Pindar come away  "Friend and fav'rite of thy Kg  "Hie thee down to Cm spring"  The sounds which struck my ravish'd ear  Were more than mortal lugs could bear  I sat amaz'd  I gasp'd I gaz'd  So wond'rous was the strain  It almost crack'd my brain  My soul was struck with dire affray  I button'd up and ran away  Now Peter if thou'lt not believe this true  Then Peter thou'rt an unbelieving Jew  But if thou art a Jew it may be prov'd from hence  That thou art circumcis'd by plainest consequence  This thou know'st best and 'tis thy own affair  For circumcis'd or not I very little care  But what I say is true as true can be  And if thou'lt not believe then hear and see  Now gentle reader thou art to suppose a Voice is heard as thus  Funny Peter  Funny Peter  Full of metre  Full of metre  Peter  Hark what sounds assail mine ear  Sure 'tis my Sn's voice I hear  O yes from none but him these words can flow  The rl duplicates full well I know  Ge  Yes Peter 'tis thy lov'd and loving Kg  For thee my bowels  yearn  at Cm spring  Now Peter run with utmost speed  To help thy Kg in time of need  Put thy better foot before  As thou didst in days of yore  In thy youthful occupation  Whether some pregnant Cornish dame  Or some hapless virgin's shame  Call'd for quick obstetrication  Friend Peter thou'rt so very droll I find  So full of humour and of comic matter  To thee this courtly office I've assign'd  To help the passage of my Cm water  Not one of all my subjects do I know  So fit to fill this pretty post as thou  Act well thy part in this and by and by  In other points thy talents I may try  But for the present this will suit thee best  'Twill give thee scope for many a merry jest  For well I know that ev'ry thing thou'lt tell  To make the people laugh at Cm well  But Peter in this fun of thine there are  Some things in which thy jokes are push'd too far  My rl speech to make the ridicule  Of ev'ry little silly grinning fool  My words of Majesty for thee to play with  Are liberties I neither can nor will away with  I fear thou'lt turn out one of that vile sort  Of varlets which infest each monarch's court  Who wear our livery suits and spite us  Who eat our pudding and backbite us  Peter  O good my Liege let me your slave  In humblest wise your pardon crave  Perish that rhyme and doggrel jest  If aught offends your rl breast  But Sire if you'll believe me  You widely misconceive me  Or else some courtier's envious tongue  Has done your slave this mighty wrong  Where'er your sacred speech I quoted  And in Pindarics fondly noted  My sole intention was to prove  My zeal my loyalty and love  Of friends and lovers 'tis the usual way  To speak of all their fav'rites do and say  Of ev'ry little pleasing anecdote to tell  On ev'ry custom'd word and syllable to dwell  My Liege I long'd to let your people know  How wond'rous wise and quick your questions flow  To make your loving subjects all rejoice  To hear the pleasing echo of your voice  For which believe me there is such demand  From folks of all degrees throughout the land  That Kearsley's presses groan both night and day  And his poor Dev'ls have neither rest nor play  Ev'n subterraneous tinners club their groats  And hungry Scotchmen sell their very oats  To purchase this delicious treat  For which they gladly forfeit drink and meat  O if you knew how well your subjects love you  I'm sure it would with joy and transport move you  It glads the cockles of my heart to tell  How rapidly my Odes Pindaric sell  Sure never monarch's words went off so well  Ge  Peter I fear in coming to this water  Thou'lt void thy wit and only learn to flatter  Already I perceive thou'st got thy cue  I guess from some of my St Js's crew  But think not thou t' obtain my favour  By words of such insipid favour  Think'st thou I'm hither for palaver come  With which thou know'st I'm surfeited at home  'Twas not for this thou heard'st me say  Funny Peter haste and come away  For thee my bowels  yearn  at Cm spring  O come to meet thy lov'd and loving Kg  Whilst here I live in vacant ease  And do and say just what I please  Now take my ride now take my walk  Now with my Cm subjects talk  Exempt from cabinets and public toils  Releas'd from Thw Ptt and council broils  Whilst here I purge away my gout and bile  Thy merry jests shall tickle me the while  I know thou art a clever dog  A witty and facetious rogue  So full of humour and of comic matter  Thy fun promotes the passage of this water  Besides I find thy witty folly  A sovereign cure for melancholy  Now whilst my couriers evil tiding bring  Of Pa's slipp'ry oscillating Kg  Whene'er thou seest my rl breast  O'ercharg'd with sorrow and with grief  Let off some pun or witty jest  So shalt thou give me sure relief  Then cease thy fawning and grimace  Suit thy demeanor to thy place  Further'tis thine to tell me public rumour  And bolt out truth whenever 'tis thy humour  This priv'lege rare all jesters hold  Allow'd from merry times of old  But Peter lik'st thou such a birth as this  Peter  O yes yes yes my LiegeO yes yes yes  Ge  Peter leave off that hasty way of speaking  Habits indulg'd are very hard of breaking  I can't divine where thou this trick hast got  For sure I am from me thou hadst it not  Peter  This trick my Liege I caught in mockery and play  And trust me now I can't leave off this apish way  Ge  Aye very like for mocking's catching I've heard say  But let's digress no farther lest we lose our way  Now Peter know it is our rl will  That thou this merry office shalt fulfil  In rhyme or prose display thy future jest  But rhyme thou'st us'd me to and so I like that best  Mark well my words I charge thee speak thy mind  So shalt thou prove thy Master ever kind  Whene'er I ask thee for advice  Be sure to give it in a trice  And now I'll try thy honesty and skill  To see how well thy duty thou'lt fulfil  I long to put thy talents to the test  And from thy answers now I'll judge of all the rest  Now Peter truths there are I hear  Deep lodg'd in courtly well  Which seldom come to Princes' ear  And none but friends like thee will tell  Then speak out Peter in thy own blunt way  What do the people of my measures say  Peter  Why truly Sire they say it is a sad disaster  That servants should rebel against so good a Master  Ge  True Peter true 'tis even so  But in this case what can I do  That Thw looks so grim and talks so big  When he gets on that awful Cy wig  With fist uprear'd he gives me such a frown  As if he really meant to knock me down  Then By Ptt that stubborn headstrong boy  Is doom'd no less my quiet to annoy  What would they more  They've all the loaves and fishes  They taste of all my store  Of sugarplums and dishes  And yet they quarrel all the while  Like thieves dividing stolen spoil  They're just like all my former friends  Nor Kg nor commonweal they mind but their own ends  Now Peter tell me what is thy advice  Peter  O yes I will my Liege and in a trice  When saucy servants give themselves such airs  Exert your rl foot and kick the knaves down stairs  Nought like a sudden tumble  To make proud spirits humble  Ge  Why Peter thy advice is full and round  But whether altogether safe and sound  I must consider on't  When I have slept upon't  But Peter say hast thou no private end  No fav'rite of thy own to recommend  Peter  Not I my Liege upon my troth  On this I'll take my Bible oath  All one to Peter whether Whig or Tory  I only wish your happiness and glory  To me it matters not who guides the helm  So but prosperity attend the realm  Yet if these thankless fellows were turn'd out  There is a man or two I could point out  What says my Liege of Cs Fx  Ge  On him and all his crew a px  Peter  But then my Liege there's Pd's honest Duke  Ge  O name him name him not 'twill make me puke  Peter methinks I smell a rat  And shrewdly guess what thou'dst be at  But play me none of these dog's tricks  I relish not thy politics  But now I feel another motion  From this same Cm's wat'ry potion  Peter attend me thou know'st where  And do thy proper office there  So shalt thou merit my regard  And all thy service meet a full reward  Dialogue between Ge and Peter ends  Now brother craft in doggrel rhyme  I hope thou'lt take my word another time  No lying Bard thou seest I was  For all I sung is come to pass  O Peter 'tis a goodly thing  To be manmidwife to a lab'ring Kg  At Cm spring  Such office to a T will fit thee  Sure nothing better could have hit thee  Thy work so easy thou'lt think nought no't  Thy birth so sweet I'm glad thy Master thought on't  Now breed no more Pindaric riot  But eat and drink and sleep in quiet  No longer tittle tattles tell  Of what what what and well well well  Henceforth forbear poor Laureat Warton  And Birthday Song to be so smart on  Whate'er Tom's model and design  For future Ode e'en pass it by  'Tis neither flesh nor fish of thine  Thou'st other fish to fry  A truce with all  Both great and small  With ev'ry brother courtier thou canst name us  From By Ptt quite down to By Ramus  Birds alike of courtly feather  Flock and fatten all together  Now Peter hold thy blabbing tongue  And tell no tales be't right or wrong  If curious gossips want to pry  Make Irish Paddy's short reply  "By Jasus honey now I see and  don't  see  "And many a thing my dear I see and  won't  see"  Peter I know thou'rt given to tattling  Once more I charge thee curb thy prattling  I really wish with all my heart  Thou may'st not fail in this weak part  If counsel good thou'lt not remember  And steadily pursue it  And govern thy unruly member  I tell thee thou shalt rue it  Disgrac'd at court what canst thou do  Or where for food and raiment go  Both  ins  and  outs  will flout thee  Ev'n Printers' Devils will scout thee  Those Printers Peter are a wicked race  All Authors know it  Without remorse they'll grind the very face  Of friendless Poet  To cope with them there was but one  Of all our corps and he is gone  Athletic Johnson with an angry frown  Could clinch his fist and knock these fellows down  He kept them all in awe so well  Though soundly drubb'd they durst not tell  But now our champion is no more  And long may we his loss deplore  For cracking Printers' crowns with fist or cane  We ne'er shall see the like of Sam again  And now of his support bereft  And friendless and defenceless left  They'll wreak their spite upon us all  The weakest still must go to th' wall  'Tis true in fair and prosp'rous times  And eager call for Poets' rhymes  These Printers can be civil  But when Pindarics will not sell  They'll dn both them and thee to hll  Headlong to serve the Dl  O Peter Printers are a broken reed  For Bards to rest uupon in time of need  Thrice happy thou whom Fortune's golden show'r  Has kindly plac'd beyond their griping power  Then if thou know'st when thou art well  Thy courtly pudding eat and nothing tell  But if thy saucy gibe must needs break out  Search out for game among that rebel rout  Which thwarts thy Master's pleasure  On Bke and Shdn and wicked Fx  Thou may'st pour forth Pindaric jokes  Sans number and sans measure  What though thy quondam cronies mouth and bellow  And call thee turncoat knave and shttn fellow  Tell them that thou hast done no more  Than patriots oft' have done before  Tell them 'tis aye  The Patriots' way  To snarl and grin  Till they get in  Ask where's the man  Of all their clan  Since time began  Or reivers ran  Whom  sop in pan  Say what they can  Did not trepan  Come then my Buck  Cheer up thy pluck  As Brother Wd says  A fig for all the patriot clan  Enjoy thy goodly  sop in pan  And happy be thy days  FINIS
