 A VINDICATION OF Sir  ISAAC NEWTON  's Principles of FLUXIONS AGAINST THE OBJECTIONS Contained in the ANALYST  By  J WALTON  Si quid novisti rectius istis  Candidus imperti Si non his utere mecum  Hor  In the Fulness of his Sufficiency he shall be in Straits Every Hand of the  WICKED  shall come upon him  JOB  DUBLIN Printed by S POWELL For WILLIAM SMITH at the  Hercules  Bookseller in  Damestreet    A VINDICATION  c  _UNDER Pretence of some Abuses committed by Mathematicians in Virtue of the Authority they derive from their Profession the Author of the  Minute Philosopher  in a  Libel  called the  Analyst  has declared 'em Infidels Makers of Infidels and Seducers of Mankind in Matters of the highest Concernment This he professes to have done not from any real Knowlege of his own but from the credible Information of others but he has neither produc'd his Informers nor proved the Accusation in any one Instance and therefore it is Defamatory  But they assume an Authority it seems in Things foreign to their Profession and undertake to decide in Matters whereof their Knowledge can by no Means qualify them to be competent Judges And as this Practice if not prevented may be of dangerous Consequence he has undertaken to enquire into the Object Principles and Method of Demonstration admitted by the Mathematicians of the present Age with the same Freedom he says they presume to treat the Principles and Mysteries of Religion to the end that all Men may see what Right they have to lead or what Encouragement others have to follow them  And whereas Sir  Isaac Newton  has presum'd to interpose in  Prophecies  and  Revelations  and to decide in religious Affairs it has been thought proper to begin with his Method of  Fluxions  and to try what cou'd be done with that Method with the Inventor himself and with his Followers And what has been done with 'em every intelligent Reader is able to judge  If this Writer may be credited the Objects about which the Method of  Fluxions  is conversant are difficult to conceive or imagine distinctly the Notions are most abstracted incomprehensible Metaphysics not to be admitted for the Foundations of clear and accurate Science the Principles are obscure repugnant precarious the Arguments admitted in Proofs are fallacious indirect illogical and the Inferences and Conclusions not more just than the Conceptions of the Principles are clear  How far the Credulous and Injudicious may become infected by this uncommon Way of treating Mathematics and Mathematicians is not easy to foresee and therefore it will be necessary to give a short Account of the Nature of  Fluxions  and of the Objects about which the Method is conversant and when it shall be made apparent that this Author has not understood the Metaphysics he wou'd refute it will not be difficult to defend the Principles and their Demonstrations from any Imputations of Fallacy or Repugnancy  which have yet been pointed at by him or any other Writer  In the Method of  Fluxions  Sir  Isaac Newton  considers mathematical Quantities not as composed of the smallest Parts but as described or generated by continual Motion Lines are described and by being described are generated not by an Apposition of Parts but by the Motion of Points Surfaces by the Motion of Lines Solids by the Motion of Surfaces Angles by the Rotation of their Sides Times by a continual Flux and so of the rest And by considering that Quantities increasing in equal Times and generated by increasing become greater or less according as the Velocity with which they increase and are generated is greater or less he found a Method of determining the Quantities themselves from the Velocities of the Motions or of the Increments with which they are generated calling the Velocities of the Motions or of the Increments  Fluxions  and the Quantities generated  Fluents  The momentaneous Increments or Decrements of flowing Quantities he elsewhere calls by the Name of  Moments  and considers the Increments as added or affirmative Moments and the Decrements as subducted or negative ones By Moments we may understand the nascent or evanescent Elements or Principles of finite Magnitudes but not Particles of any determinate Size or Increments actually generated for all such are Quantities themselves generated of Moments  The Magnitudes of the momentaneous Increments or Decrements of Quantities are not regarded in the Method of Fluxions but their first or last Proportions only that is the Proportions with which they begin or cease to exist These are not their Proportions immediately before or after they begin or cease to exist but the Proportions with which they begin to exist or with which they vanish If the Lines AC and BE are supposed to be generated in the same Time by the Motions of the Points A and B to C and E and if by continuing the Motions of  those Points to D and F they generate DC and EF synchronal Increments of AC and BE  it is evident that the Points D and F may flow back in the same Time to C and E and by flowing back perpetually lessen the Magnitudes of those Increments till at last they vanish together when the Points D and F come to coincide with C and E Now the ultimate Ratio of those Increments is that Ratio with which they vanish and become nothing or the Ratio with which they cease to be And the first Ratio of them is the Ratio with which they begin to exist at the very first setting out of the Points from C and E towards D and F  Hence if the describing Points move back to C and E in the same Time wherein by moving forward they generated the Increments DC and EF and in returning have every where the same Velocities at certain Distances from C and E which they had at those Distances  in going forward the last and first Ratios of the Increments will be equal or they will vanish and become nothing with the very same Ratio with which they began to exist  Hence likewise it appears that to obtain the last Ratio of synchronal Increments the Magnitudes of those Increcrements must be infinitely diminish'd For their last Ratio is the Ratio with which they vanish or become nothing But they cannot vanish or become nothing by a constant Diminution till they are infinitely diminish'd for without an infinite Diminution they must have finite or assignable Magnitudes and while they have finite or assignable Magnitudes they cannot vanish  The ultimate Ratios with which synchronal Increments of Quantities vanish are not the Ratios of finite Increments but Limits which the Ratios of those Increments attain by having their Magnitudes infinitely diminish'd The Proportions of Quantities which grow less and  less by Motion and at last cease to be will continually change and become different in every successive Diminution of the Quantities themselves And there are certain determinate Limits to which all such Proportions perpetually tend and approach nearer than by any assignable Difference but never attain before the Quantities themselves are infinitely diminish'd or till the instant they evanesce and become nothing These Limits are the last Ratios with which such Quantities or their Increments vanish or cease to exist and they are the first Ratios with which Quantities or the Increments of Quantities begin to arise or come into being  Quantities and the Ratios of Quantities which constantly tend to an Equality by a Diminution of their Difference and before the End of some finite Time approach nearer to an Equality than by any assignable Difference at last become equal For they become equal when the Difference between them vanishes or becomes nothing and it will  vanish or become nothing by being infinitely diminished If the Quantities AC and AD perpetually tend to an Equality either by the Motion of the Point D to C or by that of C to D they will become equal and their Ratio a Ratio of Equality when their Difference CD by a constant Diminution vanishes and becomes nothing which it will do under a Coincidence of the two Points in C or D and then either AD becomes AC and so AD AC or AC AC is a Ratio of Equality or else AC becomes AD and AD AC becomes AD AD which is also a Ratio of Equality  The Fluxions of Quantities are very nearly as the Increments of their Fluents generated in the least equal Particles of Time  If CD and EF be Increments of the Fluents AC and BE described in the least equal Particles of Time the Fluxions in the Points C and E will be nearly as the Increments DC and EF For from the exceeding Smallness of the  Times it is evident that the Points D and F must be extreamly near to C and E and by Consequence however the Velocities are accelerated or retarded thro' the Spaces CD and EF they will be very nearly the same in D and F as they were in C and E But Velocities which are very nearly uniform will be very nearly proportional to the Spaces described by them in equal Times and therefore the Velocities in the Points C and E which are the Fluxions of AC and BE in those Points will be very nearly as the Increments DC and EF described in the least equal Particles of Time  The Fluxions of Quantities are accurately in the first or last Proportions of their nascent or evanescent Increments  Thus the Fluxions of AC and BE in the Points C and E are in the first or last Ratio of the Increments CD and EF For the first or last Ratio of the Increments CD and EF is the Ratio with which they begin or cease to exist But the Ratio with which they begin or cease to exist is the same with the Ratio of the  Velocities in C and E which are the Fluxions in those Points and consequently the Fluxions in C and E are in the first or last Ratio of the Increments CD and EF  The Fluxions of Quantities are only the Velocities with which those Quantities begin to be generated or increased or the Velocities with which the generating Quantities begin to set out not the Velocities they have after moving thro' Spaces of any finite or assignable Magnitudes And therefore if two mathematical Quantities set out together and begin to move with Velocities which are as  a  and  b  they must begin to describe Spaces in the same Proportion with  a  and  b  or the Proportion with which the Spaces begin to exist or to be described must be the same with that which the Velocities have at the very Beginning of the Motion For in the very Beginning of the Motion there is neither any Change of Velocity from Acceleration or Retardation nor Difference of Time  Hence it appears that to obtain the Ratios of Fluxions the corresponding synchronal or isochronal Increments must be lessened  in infinitum  For the Magnitudes of synchronal or isochronal Increments must be infinitely diminished and become evanescent in order to obtain their first or last Ratios to which Ratios the Ratios of their corresponding Fluxions are equal  Hence likewise it appears that the Moments of like Quantities compared with each other are in Ratios compounded of the Ratios of the generating Quantities taken when first they begin to move and of the Velocities with which they set out Or in Ratios compounded of the Ratios of the generating Quantities when first they begin to move and of the first Ratios of their synchronal nascent Increments The Moments of Lines therefore are as the generating Points and as the Velocities with which they begin to move taken together The Moments of Surfaces which become greater or less by carrying of moveable Lines along immoveable  ones are in Ratios compounded of the Ratios of the moving Lines and of their first Velocities or first Ratios of the Increments which begin to rise with those Velocities And the whole Motion by which Squares or Rectangles begin to alter either from an Augmentation or Diminution of their Sides is the Sum of the nascent Motions of those Sides or the Sum of the nascent Increments arising with the first Motions of the Sides For the Proportion of nascent Increments is the same with that of the Motions with which they begin to be generated  From this short Account of the Nature of Fluxions compared with the  Analyst  it appears that the Author of that Paper is greatly mistaken in the Object of 'em and he is also mistaken in the Principles For he thinks the Moment or Fluxion of a Rectangle contain'd under two indeterminate Quantities A and B from whence are deduc'd Rules for obtaining the Moments or Fluxions of all other Products or Powers whatever is  no where truly determin'd by Sir  Isaac Newton  But he ought to have read Sir  Isaac  with more Care and Attention than he seems to have done before he set up to decide and dictate in Matters of this Nature and he wou'd do well yet to read him with Attention  If any Rectangle CK be increased from an Augmentation of its Sides by Motion so as that DK becomes LG in the same Time that DC becomes EG the Moment of that Rectangle is the Sum of the Rectangles of DK into the Moment of DC and of DC into the Moment of DK That is putting A and B for the Sides DK and DC and  a  and  b  for their respective Moments the Moment of the Rectangle AB will be A  b  + B  a  For the Gnomon CGK in the Instant it begins or ceases to exist is the Moment of the Rectangle CK But the first or last Ratio of that Gnomon to the Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC is a Ratio of Equality For the Difference  between the Gnomon and the Sum of those Rectangles perpetually lessens by a constant Diminution of the Increments FD and DH or by an Approach of the Points F and H towards D  as will be manifest on taking the Ratio between the said Gnomon and the Sum of the Rectangles at several Distances of the Points F and H from D For whatever be the Magnitudes of  a  and  b  when F and H first begin to move back towards D the Gnomon CGK and Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC will be as A  b  + B  a  +  ba  and A  b  + B  a  when those Points by moving towards D have lessen'd the Increments of DK and DC to ½  a  and ½  b  the Gnomon and Sum of the Rectangles will be as A  b  + B  a  + ½  ba  and A  b  + B  a  when they have lessen'd the Increments to ¼  a  and ¼  b  the Gnomon and Sum of the Rectangles will be  as A  b  + B  a  + ¼  ab  and A  b  + B  a  and as A  b  + B  a  +  ab  and A  b  + B  a  when they have lessen'd those Increments to  a  and  b  Hence it appears that under a constant Diminution of the Increments  a  and  b  by the Motion of the Points F and H towards D the Gnomon CGK and the Sum of the Rectangles CF and DL constantly tend to an Equality by a continual Diminution of their Difference FH and that they become equal and their Ratio becomes a Ratio of Equality in the Instant that Difference vanishes and the Points F and H coincide with D or in other Words the Gnomon and Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC begin or cease to  be  under a Ratio of Equality And therefore the Sum of those Rectangles or A  b  + B  a  is the Moment of AB  Hence the Gnomon CGK or A  b  + B  a  +  ab  found by taking the Difference between the Rectangles EL and CK or by deducting the Rectangle AB from a Rectangle contain'd under the Sides A and B increased by their whole Increments is not the Moment or Fluxion  of the Rectangle AB except in the very Instant when it begins or ceases to exist And this will also appear by considering it in another Light For the Moment of the Rectangle CK or the Motion with which it first begins to alter either by increasing or decreasing is the Sum of the nascent Motions of its Sides and the nascent Motions of its Sides are measur'd by their respective Magnitudes in the very Instant they first begin to change and by the Velocities with which they begin to move taken together and the Velocities with which the Sides begin to move being in the first Ratio of the momentaneous Spaces which arise with 'em it follows that the Sum of the nascent Motions of the Sides is the Sum of DK multiply'd into DH in its nascent State and of CD multiply'd into DF in its nascent State But DH and DF in their nascent States are the Moments of DC and DK And therefore the whole Moment of the Rectangle AB is A  b  + B  a  In determining the Moments of Quantities Sir  Isaac Newton  expresly tells us that we are only to consider the Ratios with which they begin or cease to exist and to obtain those Ratios it is not necessary that the insochronal Increments shou'd have finite Magnitudes  Cave tamen intellexeris particulas finitas  says he  Particulae finitae non sunt Momenta sed Quantitates ipsae ex Momentis genitae Intelligenda sunt Principia jamjam nascentia finitarum Magnitudinum Neque enim spectatur in hoc Lemmate magnitudo Momentorum sed prima nascentium proportio  And in another Place  Fluxiones sunt quam proximè ut Fluentium Augmenta aequalibus Temporis particulis quam minimis genita et ut accurate loquar sunt in primâ ratione Augmentorum nascentium exponi autem possunt per lineas quascunque quae sunt ipsis proportionales  And again  Siquando facili rerum conceptui consulens dixero Quantitates quam minimas vel evanescentes vel ultimas cave  intelligas quantitates magnitudine determinatas sed cogita semper diminuendas sine limite  From these Passages it appears that the Gnomon CGK in its nascent or evanescent State only or in the Instant it begins or ceases to exist is the Moment or Fluxion of the Rectangle CK and in a nascent or evanescent State when only the Increments of Quantities become their Moments its Ratio to A  b  + B  a  which is the Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC is a Ratio of Equality By diminishing the Magnitudes of  a  and  b  which are Increments of DK and DC it is obvious that the Gnomon CGK diminishes faster in Proportion than the Sum of the Rectangles FC and DL does and by diminishing faster it continually approaches to an Equality with that Sum and attains the Equality only when their Difference FH becomes evanescent that is when the Points F and H come to coincide with D so that here is no Artifice or false Reasoning used to get rid of HF or  ab  that Term having no  Existence at the very Beginning of the Motion or in the nascent State of the Augments  After Sir  Isaac  had so expresly told us what he meant by Moments and Fluxions and by nascent or evanescent Quantities one wou'd imagine it impossible to have mistaken and misrepresented him in the Manner this Author has done He seems indeed to have been lead or rather to have been deceived by an Opinion that there can be no first or last Ratios of mathematical Quantities or of their isochronal Increments generated or destroy'd by Motion imagining that no such Quantities by any Division or Diminution whatever can be exhausted or reduc'd to nothing But if Lines Surfaces and Solids can be generated or augmented by the Motion of Points Lines and Surfaces they may likewise be destroy'd or diminish'd by the Motion of the same Points Lines and Surfaces in returning to the Places from whence they first set out While a generating Quantity moves back thro' the same  Space it before described in moving forward the Quantity generated or its Augment continually lessens and by persevering in a State of decreasing it must in some finite Time vanish and become nothing and therefore mathematical Quantities by a constant Diminution may be reduc'd to nothing And such as are thus generated or destroy'd in equal Times by Motion or which arise and vanish together will arise or vanish under certain Ratios which are their first or last Ratios or the Ratios with which they begin or cease to be But it may be necessary to persue this Case a little farther and see whether Sir  Isaac Newton  's Demonstration of it cannot be defended and proved to be geometrical  Suppose any Rectangle AB augmented by continual Motion and the momentaneous Increments of its Sides A and B to be denoted by  a  and  b  the Moment of the generated Rectangle will be measured by A  b  + B  a  For when the Sides A and B wanted half of their Moments the Rectangle was  or AB ½A  b  ½B  a  + ¼  ab  And as soon as the Sides A and B are augmented by the other halves of their Moments it becomes  or AB + ½A  b  + ½B  a  + ¼  ab  From this Rectangle deduct the former and there will remain A  b  + B  a  Therefore the Increment of the Rectangle AB generated with  a  and  b  the whole Increments of the Sides is A  b  + B  a  Now in determining the Moment of a Rectangle there is nothing to be considered when it first begins to be augmented by the Motions of its Sides but the Sides themselves and the Velocities with which they begin to move or the Sides and the first Ratio of the Spaces described by them And therefore the true Moment of the Rectangle AB or the Law according to which it begins to be augmented on the Principles of Sir  Isaac Newton  will only be the Sum of  the Rectangles A  b  and B  a  for the Sides A and B begin to move with Velocities which are as  b  and  a  But this Moment A  b  + B  a  is manifestly equal to the Difference between the Rectangles  and  and therefore Sir  Isaac  's determination of it is geometrical  From the foregoing Principle so demonstrated the general Rule for finding the Moment or Fluxion of any Power of a flowing Quantity is easily deduc'd It is easy from hence to infer that the Moment or Fluxion of A  n  is as  n  A  n    or that the Fluxion of  x  n  is as  nx  n    But because this is also determined in a manner seemingly different by Sir  Isaac  in his Introduction to the  Quadrature of Curves  the Author of the  Analyst  observes  That there seems to have been some inward Scruple or Consciousness of Defect in the foregoing Demonstration  And he repeats the same Reflection in another Place adding withal  That Sir  Isaac  was not enough pleased with any one Notion steadily  to adhere to it  But Reflections of this Nature deserve no Regard unless it be allowable by way of Return to observe that the Person who makes 'em has very often been guilty of like Practices himself  See his new  Theory of Vision  his  Treatise on the Principles of Human Knowlege  and some later Undertakings of equal Importance  The Proof given in the Introduction to the  Quadratures  is said to be a most inconsistent way of arguing as proceeding to a certain Point of the Demonstration upon Supposition of an Increment and then in a fallacious Manner shifting the Supposition to that of no Increment and to shew the Inconsisteny with greater Force a Lemma is premised by Way of Axiom as if some very obvious and natural Application of an apparent Truth wou'd at once overturn the Whole of Sir  Isaac  's Demonstration But that Lemma however true in it self is no Way pertinent to the Case for which it was intended and  therefore such Inferences as are made in Virtue of it with relation to the Point in dispute are illegitimate and inconsistent with the Rules of true reasoning  Nothing is more plain and obvious than that Quantities which begin to exist together under certain Proportions and with certain Velocities may become evanescent and cease to exist under the same Proportions and with the same Velocities and this is all Sir  Isaac  supposes in that Determination of the Fluxion of  x  n  and it is not very obvious that the Lemma which this Author has hit upon is applicable to Cases of such a Nature  That the Reader may see how strictly Sir  Isaac Newton  has kept to the same Principle in this Determination how steadily he adheres to the same Method and how ill the Author of the  Analyst  has proved his Imputations it will be necessary to persue this Point and consider the Proof it self  Let it be required to find the Fluxion of x  n  supposing x to increase uniformly  Suppose  x  in any finite Particle of Time to become greater than before by a finite Increment whose Magnitude is express'd by  o  Then in the same Time that  x  by flowing becomes  x  +  o  the  n  Power of  x  will become  x  n  +  nox  n    +  o    x  n    +  c  Consequently the Magnitudes of the synchronal Increments of  x  and of  x  n  are to each other as and  nx  n    +  ox  n    +  c  Now let the Increments decrease by flowing back in like Manner as they increas'd before by flowing forward and continually grow less and less till they vanish and their ultimate Ratio that is the Ratio with which they become evanescent will be express'd by and  nx  n    But the Fluxions of Quantities are in the last Ratio of their evanescent Arguments and by Consequence the Fluxion of  x  is to that of  x  n  as to  nx  n      In this Computation Sir  Isaac  endeavours to collect the Proportion with which the isochronal Increments of  x  and of  x  n  begin or cease to exist Their Proportion obtain'd on Supposition that  o  is something is allowed to be the same with that of and  nx  n    +  ox  n    +  c  And it must be acknowleg'd that this Ratio has a Limite dependent on the Magnitude of  o  which Limite it cannot attain before the Increments are infinitely diminish'd and become evanescent and when by an infinite Diminution they become evanescent no other Terms of their Ratio will be affected so as to vanish with 'em but such as are govern'd or regulated by them In the Instant therefore that  o  vanishes  ox  n    +  c  and all ensuing Terms of the Series absolutely vanish together but the Terms and  nx  n    remain invariable under all possible Changes of the Increments from any finite Degrees of Magnitude whatever even till they become  evanescent They therefore express the last Ratio under which the isochronal Increments of  x  and  x  n  vanish or the Proportion of the Velocities with which those Increments cease to exist Sir  Isaac Newton  then rightly retain'd 'em for the Measures of the Ratio of the Fluxions of  x  and  x  n  tho' got in Virtue of his first Supposition and the Fallacy the Inconsistency lies on the Side of this Author who wou'd have them rejected on the Authority of a Lemma not to the purpose  To make this Point still more plain and obvious I shall propose the reasoning in a stronger Light It amounts therefore to this or may in other Words be thus expressed If  x  be suppos'd to flow uniformly the Fluxions of  x  and  x  n  will be as and  nx  n    For in the same Time that  x  by flowing becomes  x  +  o    x  n  will become  which by the Method of infinite Series is equal to  x  n  +  nox  n  •  +  o    x  n    +  c  Consequently  the Increments of  x  and  x  n  generated in the same Time are  o  and  nox  n    +  o    x  n    +  c  But the nascent or evanescent Increment of  x  n  is as its Fluxion and in either of these States the Ratio of  nox  n    +  o    x  n    +  c  to  nox  n    is a Ratio of Equality For as the Magnitude of  o  becomes less and less the Quantities  nox  n    +  o    x  n    +  c  and  nox  n    constantly tend to an Equality by a continual Diminution of their Difference and they become equal and their Ratio becomes a Ratio of Equality when their Difference vanishes that is in the Instant  o  becomes evanescent or in the Instant that the Increment of  x  n  first begins to exist For as they vanish together under a Ratio of Equality so they begin to exist together under the same Ratio and therefore in the nascent or evanescent State of  o  the Fluxions of  x  and  x  n  are as  o  and  nox  n    which are manifestly to each other as and  nx  n      Hence it appears that this Method of finding the Fluxion of  x  n  upon a Supposition that  x  flows uniformly is the very same with that of finding the Fluxion of a Rectangle as it is described in the second Book of the mathematical Principles For as  ab  the Difference between A  b  + B  a  +  ab  and A  b  + B  a  grows less and less perpetually by diminishing the synchronal Increments of the Sides of the Rectangle and at last evanesces and in the Instant of its Evanescence the Gnomon A  b  + B  a  +  ab  becomes equal to the Sum of the Rectangles A  b  and B  a  so  o    x  n    +  c  the Difference between  nox  n    +  o    x  n    +  c  and  nox  n    grows less and less perpetually by diminishing the Increment  o  and at last evanesces and in the Instant of its Evanescence  nox  n    +  o    x  n    +  c  becomes equal to  nox  n    And as the Gnomon A  b  + B  a  +  ab  is not the Moment or Fluxion of the Rectangle AB but in the Instant of its  becoming equal to A  b  + B  a  so  nox  n    +  o    x  n    +  c  is not the Moment or Fluxion of  x  n  but in the Instant of its becoming equal to  nox  n      The Author of the  Analyst  therefore is greatly mistaken in thinking Sir  Isaac  found the Fluxion of  x  n  by a Method different from that he used in finding the Fluxion of a Rectangle contain'd under two flowing Quantities He steadily adheres to one and the same Method namely that of taking the first or last Ratios of Quantities or of their isochronal Increments for the Measures of the Ratios of their Fluxions and uses no illegitimate Artifice to obtain these first or last Ratios unless it be accounted illegitimate to suppose that mathematical Quantities can be generated and destroyed by Motion  It is pretended  That the Method for finding the Fluxion of a Rectangle of two flowing Quantities as it is set forth in the  Treatise of Quadratures    differs from that found in the  second Book of the Principles  and is in Effect the same with that used in the  Calculus differentialis  For the supposing a Quantity infinitely diminish'd and therefore rejecting it is in Effect the rejecting an Infinitesimal  But if this Author deduces the Rule from the first Proposition in the  Treatise of Quadratures  and considers it ever so little he will find it the very same with that set down in the  second Book of the Principles  And it is doubtless in Effect too the same with that used in the  differential Calculus  so far as different Methods  can  effect the same Thing but no farther For Quantities are not rejected in the Method of Fluxions as in the  differential Calculus  on Account of their exceeding Smallness  But according to the received Principles it is evident says he that no geometrical Quantity by being infinitely diminish'd can ever be exhausted or become nothing  Now on the received Principles of Fluxions this is  a direct Absurdity For these Principles suppose that mathematical Quantities can be generated by Motion which he has not yet thought proper to contradict and consequently they may also by Motion be destroy'd For Quantities and the Augments of Quantities which in some finite Time are produc'd by Motion may perpetually grow less and less by reverting that Motion and by constantly growing less and less they may come to be infinitely diminished or to be less than any assignable Quantities and from being less than any assignable Quantities the Motion still persevering they must at last vanish and become nothing otherwise it might be contended that a Body setting out from any Place and in any finite Time describing a certain length cou'd never by moving back and returning in the same Line arrive at the Place from whence it first set out  Upon the whole then it appears that the Method of Fluxions as describ'd by Sir  Isaac Newton  in his Introduction to the  Quadrature of Curves  and in the  second Book of his mathematical Principles  is not that wretched unscientifical Knack set forth in the  Analyst  but a Method founded upon obvious rational accurate and demonstrative Principles It likewise appears that the Conclusions do not arise from illegitimate tentative Ways or Inductions but follow from such Premises and by such Arguments as are most conformable to the Rules of Logic and right Reason All the Skill and Dexterity therefore by this Author shewn in the Investigation of contrary Errors correcting each other are vain and impertinent He has mistaken the Doctrine of Fluxions and by not rightly distinguishing its Principles from those of the  differential Calculus  has imposed a false Measure of Moments upon his Readers and arguing from that false Measure has unjustly charg'd Sir  Isaac  with Errors arising from it and to mend the Matter has instituted Computations to shew how those Errors redress one another and how Mathematicians by Means of Errors bring forth Truth and Science  The Dispute between the Followers of Sir  Isaac Newton  and the Author of the  Analyst  is not about the Principles of the  differential Calculus  but about those of Fluxions and it is whether these Principles in themselves are clear or obscure and whether the Inferences from them are just or unjust true or falsescientific or otherwise We are not concerned about Infinitesimals or minute Differences but about the Ratios with which mathematical Quantities begin or cease to exist by Motion and to consider the first or last Proportions of Quantities does not imply that such Quantities have any finite Magnitudes They are not the Proportions of first or last Quantities but Limits of Ratios which Limits the Ratios of Quantities attain  only  by an infinite Diminution of their Magnitudes by which infinite Diminution of their Magnitudes they become evanescent and cease to exist If therefore Quantities may cease to exist by Motion and if the Ratios with which they become evanescent be truly determin'd it will follow that there are no Errors however  small admitted in the Principles of Fluxions and if no Errors be admitted in the Principles there can be none in the Conclusions nor any to be accounted for in the Arguments by which those Conclusions are deduc'd from their Premises The Hints therefore which this Author has condescended to give the Mathematicians for ascertaining the Truth of their Conclusions by means of contrary Errors destroying each other will probably be left to be further extended and apply'd by himself to all the  good Purposes  he pleases to extend and apply them as having more Leisure and a Science more transcendental  A  Philosophia prima  a certain transcendental Science superior to and more extensive than Mathematics which he says it might behove our modern  Analysts  rather to learn than despise  and perhaps a much greater Curiosity for such Matters than they have  It has been observ'd before that Fluxions may be expounded by any Lines which are proportional to them and so the Analysis may be instituted by considering  the mutual Relations or Proportions of finite Quantities as the Proportions of Fluxions themselves To this it is objected  That if in order to arrive at these finite Lines proportional to Fluxions there be certain Steps made use of which are obscure and inconceivable it must be acknowleged that the Proceeding is not clear nor the Method scientific  But there may be many Steps obscure and inconceivable to Persons who are unacquainted with Sir  Isaac Newton  's Method of first and last Ratios with his Doctrine of Fluxions and with his Principles of Motion and yet those Steps may appear very different to others who have duly consider'd 'em And therefore till it be made apparent from geometrical Principles that the fluxional Triangle which evanesces upon the returning of the Ordinate of any Curve to the Place from whence it first set out cannot in its last Form that is in the Form it has at the Instant it becomes evanescent be
