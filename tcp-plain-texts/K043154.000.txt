 BARATARIA OR SANCHO TURN'D GOVERNOR A FARCE IN TWO ACTSâ–ª As it is Performed at the TheatreRoyal CoventGarden  By FREDERICK PILON  LONDON PRINTED BY J ALMON No FLEETSTREET MDCCLXXXV  To the PUBLIC  THE subject of the following Farce is taken from the second part of D'Ursey's Don Quixote Three scenes only of the original have been retained and even these it was found necessary to materially alter and enrich with additions to give them a modern a novel complexionImpressed with every veneration for the genius of Cervantes the present writer has adhered to him as closely as the nature of dramatic writing would admit and should the same of that celebrated wit protect Sancho on the stage the author of Barataria need not wrsh to be more successful  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Don Quixote  Mr DAVIES

Ladies Guards and Attendants  BARATARIA  ACT I  Scene an Apartment in Duke Ricardo's Palace  Enter  MANUEL  and  PEDRO  MANUEL  THIS is truly a curious whim of the Duke's to make Sancho a governor  Pedro  I like the fancy of all things and can anticipate in idea laughter without end from it Sudden elevation too often makes the wise man forget himself and become ridiculous now I shall be glad to see what effect it will have upon a fool  Manuel  The best of the joke is old Rodriguez her Grace's woman takes every thing seriously and is enraged to see a fellow like Sancho Panca dignified with the title of governor whilst nothing is done for her after so many years attendance on the Duchess  Pedro  Arn't you to be continually about his person  Manuel  Yes but the Duke has not yet given me my instrustions in full I wish you had overheard Don Quixote this morning admonishing Sancho for degrading his rank by scuffling with one of the grooms over the gridiron about a brown crust and a rasher of bacon He lookt as fierce as the knight of the burning sword or the knight of the burning pestle whilst the chopfallen Governor hung his head as if he expected every minute to be cut into mincemeat or pounded to a jelly In pity to poor Sancho at last I interposed and rescued his Excellency from a ribroasting  Pedro  As I am known to have pickt up a smattering of Latin whilst attending the Duke at Salamanca I have been appointed state physician to his Governorship  Manuel  The worst character you could have assumed to appear gracious in Sancho's eye he has a mortal aversion to physicians and lawyers since his beloved Dapple had like to have been killed by the quackery of a horsedoctor and he himself ruined by the knavery of a pettyfogging attorney I should not be surprized if he commence his government by issuing a proclamation for the extinction of both professions sentencing the members of each to hang up and poison one another  Pedro  History says the cackling of a goose saved a whole nation in antient times and may again in modern for ought we can tell to the contrary  Manuel  These trumpets announce our new Governor receiving his commission in form for Heaven sake let us see the ceremony  Pedro  By all means I would not miss it to be appointed governor to an island in good earnest  Exeunt  Scene changes to a grand apartment In the palace the Duke tie Duchess Don Quixote Sancho Rodriguez and attendants discovered A pompous flourish of trumpets  Duke  Illustrious and renowned La Mancha we hold ourselves much honor'd by your visit Your resolution still to follow fortune and add new laurels to your well won fame we must commend however it afflicts usand be allured the choice we have made of your faithful 'squire to fill a post of honour trust and dignity is chiefly owing to the high rank he has long held in your favour Your patronage has rais'd him to our esteeim and friendship  Don  Your Grace is truly noble My lense of all your many favors transcends the power of utterance I quit your territories fill'd with sentiments of your Grace sublime and awful My faithful Sancho I am well assured will never forfeit that confidence your Grace reposes  in him shou'd he prove ingrate no punishment wou'd be severe enough for his desertsno power withhold my means to inflict it  Duke  My worthy friend to Sancho proceed we now to your nomination  Don  'Sdeath is that a look fit for a Governor Hold up thy head for shamehis joy my Lord has so prest upon his spirits his tongue is not yet at liberty  Duke  Know all we here have made our choiceOf Barataria be thou Governor and thy commands be absolute  Omnes  Long live the noble Governor of Barataria  Artillery discharged drums and trumpets flourish whilst Sancho is invested with the ensigns of his new appointment  Duke  Into your hands we put your new commission with our broad seal which raises you to supreme authority over our islanders  Gives him a roll of parchment  Sancho  And good care your Grace shall find I'll take of it nobody shall steal this muffin from me  handling the seal  I'll lay my seal up at night and my robes also where no thieves shall come at them  Don Quixote  Oh fortunate Sancho Oh most happy 'Squire I greet thee  Duchess  And I  Omnes  And all of us  Sancho  Ah marry Sir this sounds well indeed there's no squeaking in this bagpipe it's wonderful to think how merrily an ass will trip up hill that's laden wiih gold  Don Quixote  Art thou now satisfied that through my means thou hast at last obtained thy longlooktfor government  Sancho  I am Sir longlooktfor come at last better late than never he who is obstinate soon wears his coat threadbare folly may hinder a man of many a good turn I beseech you Sir to pardon my proverbs and thank the Duke there for his noble favour which I do now resolve to deserve by filling my place as well as I can  Duke  Have the chief citizens and leading men of the island notice of their new Governor's approach  Attendant  They have my Lord  Duke  'Tis well Is there ought else our muchbeloved Sancho in which myself or the Duchess there can honor thee  Duchess  Any thing in my powerthe noble Governor is sure he may command unless it be to give him leave to salute my woman Rodriguez before he departs for his government  Rodriguez  Salute meI'd see his Governorship hanged first  Duke  Come good words Rodriguez there is a vast distinction now between you and Sancho but to prevent that envy and that insult his sudden elevation may excite be it known that henceforward the commands of the Noble Don Sancho be absolute as my own throughout all my dominions  Duch  Be it your care Rodriguez to see the squire is nobly treated  San  Thank your noblenessesthen pray mistress since I find you have nothing to do will you be so kind just to step yonder into the courtyard and you'll find a dapple grey assdo so much as see they tend him as well as my master's horse for 'tis a loving creature I can't 'tend him myself by reason you see I have affairs here to mind  Rod  Why how now jackanapes know you whom you talk totake that  strikes him  for your ill manners if you were fifty times a governor  San  A guard a guard and bear her away to prison I'll have the witch burnt alive for striking a governor  Duke  Hold great governorWe feel the indignity shewn to your person in as lively a manner as if it had been offered to our own  Duch  And be assured this disrespect to us shall not go unpunished  Duke  Yet in consideration of the offending party's sex  San  Her sex I wish your grace had felt her fistbody of me you'd have had your doubts about her sex do but look at it its shaped like a shoulder of mutton and comes down like a mallet  Duke  I say in consideration of her sex and that it is her first offence we will not punish Rodriguez with that death which she so justly merits but it is our high degree that you instantly make proper concession to wipe off the baseaffront with which you have marked his countenance  Sancho  No more wipes or marks I beseech your grace from that lady in the countenance however lest your grace shou'd think me an illnatured fellow in consideration of Rodriguez's great age we forgive her  Rodriguez  I despise your forgiveness Sirrah upon any such terms my great age my great age truely  Sancho  What ever doubts the hardness of her fist made me entertain of her sex are entirely removednow I'm sure she's a woman since she had rather die than acknowledge herself an old one  Duke  But come friend Sancho its time you depart to take possession of your government your subjects by this time expect you  Don Quixote  Then by all means Sancho begone that governor who wou'd live happily himselfmust first study the happiness of his people  Sancho  I tell you what master of mine the best governor that ever wore hair upon his chin wont sometimes be able to please his people but I'll do the best I can every man was n't born with a silver spoon in his mouth but if after all nothing will do why I'll e'en leave them to themselves and wash my hands of the government  Duke  There are few governors friend Sancho when they retire from power whose hands do not require a little cleaning so wishing thee all health and tranquility in thy island most noble governor adieu  Exeunt Duke Dutchess and attendants trumpets flourish  Manent Sancho and Quixote  Don Quixote  I yet must be a minute with my friend I'll follow your grace instantly at lenght my faithful 'Squire I behold fortune reward thy long services yet 'ere I leave thee attend to my admonitions and I will be thy north star to pilot thy bark and steer it into the harbour safety and honor first my Sancho  Sancho  I beseech you Sir to speak slowlythat I may keep pace with you you know my understanding was always more for the trot than the gollopand I am but a  chicken  of a governor yet you know  Don Quixote  If thou wouldst make thyself a proper governor be careful of thy moralsto have or to be thought to have morality is extremely useful for a governor if it were nothing but to be a skreen that people might not pry too curiously into his conduct and proceedingsnot but that his actions ought to be such as will bear the strictest scrutinyyet if he be once reputed a moral man let him be a Turk in opinion or religion tis not threehalfpence mattersecondly my Sancho  Sancho  That firstly is a special good law  Don Quixote  Secondly I say a governor ought to have a nice and tender conscience so very susceptible a fly cannot buz near it without making him shrink  Sancho  It ought to sit tight and close to him like a thimble upon the Duchess's finger not as I have heard it sits sometimes like a jockey's boot that he can stretch which way he pleases  Don Quixote  Next be su  e not to forget thy original nor blush to own thou com'st of a mean extraction for for when thou art not asham'd of it thyself nobody will seek to make thee so  Sancho  But then there will be no occasion to tell the people I was once a hogdriverBesides when I have got the government and am grown rich nobody will trouble themselves about what I was daub yourself over with honey and you'll never want flies  what a man has so much he's sure of    Don Quixote  Sancho you must be cautious not to overlaid thy discourse with those cursed proverbs when  properly and judiciously used they enrich and embellish conversation but thou bringst 'em in so by the head and shoulders that the purpose is defeated  Sancho  Ecod I believe Sir my mother longed for them its a disease that heaven alone can cure me of I have proverbs enough to fill a large sack and when I talk they crowd so thick to my mouth that they quarrel which shall get out first  Don Quixote  The next thing Sancho is to be cautious in your choice of officers of trust remember you are but guardian of the  people's treasure  and must be careful to chuse honest men  Sancho  Yes master but how am I to know them after the steed's stol'n 'tis too late to shut the stable door I intend to act with  certainty  in this case and as I am sure my people will not produce any man that's honester than their governor I will instantly appoint  myself  first lord of the treasury of Barataria  Don Quixote  In that case Sancho I fear thy people will think thou hast not so much disinterestedness as thou ought'st Prudently examine what thy income may amount to in a year then if thou can'st afford fourscore servants keep but half and what wou'd maintain the others give to the poor that their blessings may accompany thee wherever thou appearst in the execution of justice act with strict impartiality avoid corruption or the taking of bribes which is so tempting and withal so crying a sin there is not one governor in forty can forbear damning himself by it  Sancho  Why then lord have mercy upon my soul too for to deal plainly I am afraid my fingers as well as the rest will itch most cursedly to be handling the money But Sir I hope you'll allow there are perquisites which its fair a man should receive in all places if it was not for the fees some places wou'd not be worth the having like the sauce to certain meats which sometimes exceeds the dish itself  Don Quixote  I wou'd not have thee Sancho when appointed a protector turn out a scourge and a tyrant he flatters himself in vain with hopes of enjoying happiness in the possession of immense wealth when obtained  at the price of blood and the tears and sufferings of impoverished provinces it is true he may silence his accusers by rich presents and thus escape the sword of earthborn justice but guilt and remorse will poison all his pleasures and tell him there is no blinding the eyes or staying the sword of divine vengeance  Sancho  Don't you think Sir you have made this bribery business rather a little too longI'm afraid I shall forget the best part of it  Don Quixote  I could be somewhat satirical upon thy parts now but that I love thee Sancho and therefore will desist besides to do thee justice thou art not the first who has had a government he was not beholden to his deserts for  Sancho  No nor shan't be last Sir for desert is governed by fortune you know and in a double manner for if some were to have their true deserts they would be princes and governors presently and if others again were to have theirs o'ons what an army of them would be hang'd up in one summer  Don Quixote  Well dear Sancho for that saying thou deservest not only to govern an island but an empire walk with gravity and speak with deliberation drink moderately for drunkeness neither observes a promise nor keeps a secret eat little at dinner and less at supper  Sancho starts  for the stomach is the storehouse whence health is to be imparted to the whole body if thou observest these rules thy days will be long and prosperious thou shalt live beloved by allthy government shall be peaceable and when the time of thy departure from this world arrivesthy children and grand children shall with duteous steps lamenting follow thee to the silent tomb  Sancho yawns violently  I perceive my Sancho thou art weary of my good advice and I shall lose time in bestowing more rules for thy well doing therefore lastly  Sanch  Lastly  I am glad of that with all my heart unless your lastly should be as long as Master Perez our curate's whose lastly is longer than all the rest of his discourse  Don Quixote  Lastly I say be vigilant avoid that horrid drowsiness to which thou art accustom'd You have been long addicted to much sleep now you are a man who must be ever watchful for the good of your people  Sancho  I don't see any great occasion for that your kings and princes must sleep as well as other men and then see master what a pleasure I shall lose next to eating the greatest The blessing of his heart light on him who first invented this same sleep it covers a man over like a cloak There is but one thing makes me dislike sleep it resembles death too much there's little difference between a man in his first and a man in his last sleep  Don Quixote  This is all the advice I shall deliver to you at present if thou tak'st care to let me hear from thee hereafter I shall give thee more  Sancho  I see very well that all you have told me is mighty good and pat to the purpose but what am I the better if I can't keep it in my head by tomorrow I shall no more remember all this than the shape of last week's clouds therefore pray let me have it in black and white for tho' I can't write I'll get one of my people to hammer it into m  noddle and as for the disgrace of not writing I can pretend my hand is lame and so get my secretary to sign for me for there's a remedy for all things but death  Don Quixote  I now shall leave you Sancho I have done my duty in giving thee good and wholesome advice if thou dost not do the part of a good Governor thine will be the fault tho' the shame and discredit will be mine His Highness has sent for your wise and daughter Mary prepare yourself to meet them and wait at the town's end the arrival of your peopleAdieu  Sancho  Good bye SirI can but thank yeYou have given me a plaguy deal of good council if I have but the grace to follow itbut come many ventures make a full freightthe cudgel that bruises is the thing that contuzes I'll be very complaisant in the beginning but hold to the end say I The cowl does not make the friar nor the gown a governor So Sir  wishing you soon to be an emperor we take our leave to feast and give our islanders a play day and

the time passes when a man wants to get into power I wish my people would come I here is one thing my master gave me a great charge about I must be very careful not to forget  and that is instead of the words I and me I am in future to say we and us We will sup with you and you shall sup with us Ecod it sounds very bigBut then does not making so much of  we  look as if  I  was nobody It is as much as to say  we  great men are no longer ourselves There's a devilish good saving clause tho' in we in case  I  should do any thing amiss  we  may make other people accountable Well but we think our corporation of Barataria are not very mannerly to keep us kicking our heels here so longwe have such a craving at our stomach that we cou'd sit down to dinner with Dapple and seast upon thirties Poor fellow  patting Dapple's head  he too looks as hungry as a judge's clerk at a long trial We may be considered now as the best of all Governors for we arc sarting sor our people Well if we fast

Lordship's serene pleasure that they should have the honor of throwing themselves at your Lordship's feet  Sancho  Why then let them know that it is my serene pleasure they do so and tell them also that if they had opened their gates to me an hour ago I should have had a  serene appetite  as well as a serene pleasure at seeing them  Mess  Your Lordship knows the orders issued by his Highness the Duke cou'd not be dispens'd with  Sancho  Well plague of this talkinglet'em come and with as short a ceremony as possible  Exit messenger bowing off  I'd almost exchange my government for  a good dinner Oh here they come at last  Enter Magistrates and others in great form Recorder with a paper  Upon my word the corporation of Barataria has a most citizenlike appearance What a fine fat figure of an Alderman that is yonder he has turtle and venison and calf'shead in his tountenance Why what's all this The corporation's as mute as a drove of oxen I suppose they wait for me to break the ice here goes then neck or nothing like a true courtier I'll tip them flummery tho' I wish them up to their necks in a horsepond Well my worthy honest good friends how do you all do have you any thing to say to me  Recorder  reads the speech  Most high and mighty Don Sancho descended from that most ancient and rever'd stock the Pancas of La Mancha a family not more distinguished for the antiquity of its origin than for the iliultrious characters with which it has adorn'd the worldfor more than three hundred years your ancestors have been leaders of armies and counsellors to princes  Sancho  Hold hold friendmany words fill not a busneltell truth and shame the devila liar should have a good memory and to my certain knowledge either you or I am confoundedly mistaken What my family was three hundred years ago is neither here nor there but I can assure you not one of them who came within my knowledge ever led any armies except it was an army of turkies and geese which I myself indeed have valliantly drove to market then as to counselling Princes I never saw one in my life except the Duke your Lord and mine who has made me a Governor so now go on but if you possibly can avoid fibbing  Recorder  In you my Lord shine all the noble qualities of your illustrious namesake and near relation Don Sancho of Arragon who gallantly slew with his own hand seven and sorty Moors in one battle and routed an army of half a million  Sancho  You have told me seven and sorty lies already and if I was to suffer you to proceed I foresee you'd tell me half a million The noble qualities of my near relation shine in me Whatever  shines  in me I know here  is a great deal of something  shines  in you to tell me such stories  Recorder  You yourself are my Lord  Sancho  As hungry as a huntertherefore Mr Recorder put up your long speechand after dinner I'll put on my nightcap and hear you go over the whole of it again with composure  Recorder  There are yet further ceremonies to be observed before you enter into office  Sancho  How many stumbling blocks are in the road to preferment its besieging a town to get into place  Recorder  First we present you with the keys of the town  Sancho  Well then I remember my master bid me return them so there they are again Don't think you have got a Governor who means to keep you under lock key like so many pigs in a pound Giving me the keys of your town is as much as to say you commit your rights and liberties to my charge and I return them to tell you that I do not mean to abuse the trust And now my honest friend let us go to dinner  Recorder  We first solicit your Excellency's gracious answer  Sancho  My answer To what question  Recorder  We mean your Lordship's answer to our dutiful and loyal addressIt is usual for the Governor on these occasions to express his approbation of our attachment and loyalty to him in a speech and promise at the same time to take every step within the compass of his abilities conducive to our interest and welfare  Sancho  I understand you that is you scratch my back and I'll claw your elbow What signifies making fine promises before hand it's very easy to make them to get into place and easier still to break them when secure in the saddle no no on both sides the proof of the pudding shall be in the eating of it I'll approve of your loyalty if I like the entertainment you have provided for me Good governors always like good eating and good citizens always take care to provide such  Recorder  A sumptuous banquet is prepared for your Excellency's table which will be ready after your public entry into town  Sancho  Come then let's be gone  Officer  But how wou'd your Excellency have us dispose of the ass  Sancho  Lord Lord how soon a great man begins to forget his friendsWhat Dapple the companion of all my fastings and drubbings forget thee no never I'll have a place laid for him every day at my own table and cou'd he but read and write I'd make him my secretary  Recorder  Such an instance of preferment is not unprecedented a Roman Emperor made his horse fill one of the highest departments in the flate  Sancho  He did Then I tell you what Mr Recorder Dapple shall have the place and for the good wishes you seem to entertain for him you shall do the business as his deputy  Exeunt omnes  PROCESSION composed of vrious Groups of Baratarians

Barataria enforcing the superiority of shoes hoping you will wear them only  Sancho  Why what's to be done in this business I wou'd fain please all parties but that's impossible as the case stands before meSuppose I promise to wear boots all the winter and shoes all the summer  Manuel  But then there's the spring and autumn what do you intend to wear during those seasons  Sancho  In the spring

have brought that commodity in quality to the finest linen cloth beg that in future you wou'd wear it in shirts and thus render the consumption of that article universal  Sancho  I must confess I have

from the opticians requesting your Lordship would wear spectacles  Sancho  What whether I want them or not  Manuel  If you want them there is no merit in the wearing of themyou cannot be too disinterested in your encouragement of tradebesides there is nothing gives the face such an air of wisdom as spectacles they look like magnifying skylights or rather intellectual microscopes thro' which sublimer understandings contemplace the little objects of this little world to nearer advantage  Sancho  Well as every governor must have his blind side ours shall be to please our peopleso that petition is grantedbut zooks I grow impatient you'll famish me with too much business  Manuel  You'll hear the petition my Lord from the dealers in mum  Sancho  Well let's hearthe dealers in mum can't

I can but I fear 'twill be a hard matter  Exit Man  Sancho  I begin to perceive that this island is very full of enormities  Noise without  Sancho  How now what's the matter  Reenter Woman and Little Man  Woman  O your Honor this impudent fellow contrary to your honor's judgement has follow'd me and wou'd have taken the purse away from me by force and sent the constable to bring me again before your worship  Sancho  And has he got the purse  Woman  No I warrant your worship you ordered me to keep it and I wou'd have pulled his eyes out 'ere I'd part with it  Sancho  Give it me let me see if

come what have you say  Smuggler  Why my Lord you must know that I am owner of a small coasting vessel in which I carry goods to different parts of your lordship's island for sale now as it happens that I am sometimes obliged to put to sea in very dark nights for fear of losing the wind I have more than once neglected paying the duty for the commodities I have shipped  Sancho  And what do you call this but smuggling you dogEh what have you to say for yourself now  Smuggler  Truly very little my Lord but there are a few friends in this canvass bag that will convince your Lordship I had no dishonest intentions  Giving Sancho a bag of money  Sancho  Eh Why upon my word there is some weight in this last argument  Smuggler  I have kept a regular account of every shilling I was indebted to the revenue for these three years back which finding it amount to five hundred crowns I put it in that bag and I have now honestly paid your Lordshipand discharged my conscience  Officer  Dont believe a syllable he utters my Lord for to my knowledge he has been a smuggler these twenty years  Sancho  Then what's the reason you never informed against him before  Smuggler  Bccause my Lord I used to pay him all my arrears and he informs against me now only because I did not think the contents of that bag so safe in his hands as in your Lordship's  Sancho  I believe itevery word you speak carries conviction with it I never met a man who used stronger arguments  Handling the bag  why shou'd not a smuggler have credit as well as other tradesmen and you Mr Customhouse Officer take notice we

as I snatch'd it out of the dish from them  puts the pheasant on the table  so now your worship has proof before you  Sancho  By my faith the case is plainwhat can you say to this Radish is this your

little good sause to itthis were a dish fit for a governor  Tears a leg off and begins to eat it  Gardener  But hear me my Lord this is the trick on't I and Snip us'd often at each others houses jestingly to take thing and t'other day having a choice flask of Florence sent a present to my wife from her rich godmother I gave this Snip and his wife a taste  Sancho  Friendly go on  Speaks with his mouth full  Gardener  But not contented with that he took the opportunity of my absence to make free with the restso I thought I had no better way of being even with him than by stealing his wife's pheasant  Taylor  Why how now you old rusty pruning knife you maggot in a peascod you caterpillar will you swear your thingut wine was Florence  Gardener  That I will and have here another flask just sent me by the same person  Sancho  Nay look you Snip take heed of lyingI don't sit here to see justice abus'dif it be really Florence look to it  tastes it  it is  again  sure I can't be mistaken  Gardener  Believe me Sir it is real Florence  Sancho  It is indeedand are these things fitting for taylors and gardenersfat pheasants and rich winesand you knaves both since you have made a practice by your own confessions of stealing from one another'tis plain each of you keeps a house to encourage thievery and by and by will steal from others I therefore condemn them both to pay ten
