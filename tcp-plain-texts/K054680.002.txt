 ANECDOTES OF PAINTING in ENGLAND With some Account of the principal Artists And incidental NOTES on other ARTS  Collected by the late Mr GEORGE VERTUE And now digested and published from his original MSS By Mr HORACE WALPOLE  The SECOND EDITION  Le sachant Anglois je crus qu'il m'alloit parler d'edifices et de peintures  Nouvelle Eloise vol i p  VOL II  Printed by THOMAS KIRGATE at STRAWBERRYHILL MDCCLXV  ANECDOTES of PAINTING  c  CHAP I  Painters and other Artists in the Reign of JAMES I  IT was well for the arts that King James had no disposition to them He let them take their own course Had he felt any inclination for them he would probably have introduced as bad a taste as he did into litterature A Prince who thought puns and quibbles the perfection of eloquence would have been charmed with the monkies of Hemskirk and the drunken boors of Ostade James loved his ease and his pleasures and hated novelties He gave himself up to hunting and hunted in the most cumbrous and inconvenient of all dresses a ruff and trowser breeches The nobility kept up the magnificence they found established by Queen Elizabeth in which predominated a want of taste rather than a bad one In more ancient times the mansions of the great lords were as I have mentioned before built for defence and strength rather than convenience The walls thick the windows pierced wherever it was most necessary for them to look abroad instead of being contrived for symmetry or to illuminate the chambers To that style succeeded the richness and delicacy of the Gothic As this declined before the Grecian taste was established space and vastness seem to have made their whole ideas of grandeur The palaces  erected in the reign of Elizabeth by the memorable Countess of Shrewsbury Elizabeth of Hardwicke are exactly in this style The apartments are lofty and enormous and they knew not how to furnish them Pictures had they had good ones would be lost in chambers of such height Tapestry their chief moveable was not commonly perfect enough to be real magnificence Fretted cielings gracefull mouldings of windows and painted glass the ornaments of the preceding age were fallen into disuse Immense lights composed of bad glass in diamond panes cast an air of poverty on their most costly apartments That at Hardwicke still preserved as it was furnished for the reception and emprisonment of the Queen of Scots is a curious picture of that age and style Nothing can exceed the expence in the bed of state in the hangings of the same chamber and of the coverings for the tables The first is cloth of gold cloth of silver velvets of different colours lace fringes and embroidery The hangings consist of figures large as life representing the virtues and vices embroidered on grounds of white and black velvet The cloths to cast over the tables are embroidered and embossed with gold on velvets and damasks The only moveables of any taste are the cabinets and tables themselves carved in oak The chimnies are wide enough for a hall or kitchen and over the arras are freezes of many feet deep with miserable relievos in stucco representing huntings There and in all the great mansions of that age is a gallery remarkable only for its extent That at Hardwicke is of sixty yards  James built no palace himself Those erected by the Nobles in his reign are much like what I have been describing Audleyinn  Dugdale writing after the days of Inigo Jones says that this house was not to be equalled by any fabric in this realm excepting Hamptoncourt There are prints of Audleyinn in it's grandeur by Winstanley who lived at Littlebury near it where within my memory was his house remarkable for several mechanic tricks known by the name of WINSTANLEY's WONDERS His plates of Audleyinn are extant but the prints are very scarce Part of the edifice was taken down about forty years ago and a greater part with the magnificent gallery was demolished after the decease of the last Earl of Suffolk of that line  PAUL VANSOMER  TChambars sculp  one of the wonders of that age deserved little notice but for the prodigious space it covered Towards the end of that monarch's reign genius was called out and appeared The magnificent temper or taste of the Duke of Buckingham led him to collect pictures and pointed out the study of them to Prince Charles Rubens came over Inigo Jones arose and architecture broke forth in all the lustre and purity of Rome and AthensBut before I come to that period I must clear my way by some account of the preceding artists The first painter who seems to have arrived after the accession of James was  PAUL VANSOMER  a native of Antwerp The accounts of him are extremely deficient no author of the lives of painters mentioning him but Carl Vermander who only says that Vansomer was living when he wrote and then resided with his brother Bernard at Amsterdam Yet Vansomer as a painter of portraits was a very able master The picture of the Lord Chamberlain William Earl of Pembroke half length at St James's is an admirable portrait and a whole length at Chatsworth of the first Earl of Devonshire in his robes though ascribed to Mytens I should think was painted by the same hand Mytens was much colder in his  colouring and stiff in his drawing  Mytens improved so much in his later portraits that this character must be read with allowances and on studying more of his works I cannot determine whether the portrait at Chatsworth is not painted by him as constant tradition says it was In general the portraits by Vansomer and Mytens when at whole length may be thus distinguished Vansomer commonly placed his on a mat Mytens on a carpet  Both these portraits are bold and round and the chiaro scuro good The Earl of Devonshire is equal to the pencil of Vandyck and one of the finest single figures I have seen In what year Vansomer came to England we do not know certainly as early as between which and he did several pictures I shall mention but a few that are indubitably his from whence by comparison his manner may be known  James I at Windsor behind him a view of Whitehall  Anne of Denmark with a prospect of the west end of St Paul's  The same King at Hamptoncourt armour lying by him on the ground better than the former Dated  His Queen in blue with a horse and dogs also at Hamptoncourt This picture is imitated in the tapestry at Houghton  Three ladies at Ditchley Lady Morton in purple another with yellow lace about her neck and a gauze scarf the third in black with a crape over her forehead  Lord Chancellor Bacon and his brother Nicholas at Gorhambury  Sir Simon Weston brother of Lord Treasurer Portland whole length with a pike in his hand aet This piece was in the possession of the Lord Chief Justice Raymond  Marquis of Hamilton with the white staff at Hamptoncourt  Vansomer died about the age of fortyfive and was buried at St  CORNELIUS JANSEN  TChambars sculp  Martin's in the Fields as appears by the register Jan Paulus Vansomer pictor eximius sepultus fuit in ecclesiâ  CORNELIUS JANSEN  generally but inaccurately called Johnson was according to Sandrart born in London of Flemish parents but Vertue and the author of an Essay towards an English school say it was at Amsterdam where the latter asserts that he resided long the former that he came over young which considering how late he lived I should be inclined to believe if Vertue did not at the same time pronounce that his earliest performances are his best So good a style of colouring was hardly formed here His pictures are easily  He sometimes put this mark on his pictures  fecit  distinguished by their clearness neatness and smoothness They are generally painted on board and except being a little stiff are often stronglly marked with a fair character of nature and remarkable for a lively tranquillity in the countenances His draperies are seldom but black I have two portraits by him of singular merit one of Mr Leneve master of the company of merchanttaylors the other of Sir George Villiers father of the great Duke of Buckingham less handsome but extremely like his son One of his hands rests on the head of a greyhound as fine as the animals of Snyder  Jansen's first works in England are dated about He dwelt in the Blackfriars and had much business His price for a head was five broad pieces He painted too in small in oil and often copied his  own works in that manner In the family of Verney were the portraits of Sir Robert Heath and his lady in both sizes At Cashiobury is a large piece curious but so inferior to Jansen's general manner that if his name were not to it I shou'd doubt it's being of his hand It represents Arthur Lord Capel who was beheaded his Lady and Children Behind them is a view of the Garden at Hadham at that time the chief seat of the family Between the years and Jansen lived much in Kent at a small village called Bridge near Barhamdown and drew many portraits for gentlemen in the neighbourhood particularly of the families of Auger Palmer Hammond and Bowyer One of his best works was the picture of a Lady Bowyer of the family of Auger called for her exquisite beauty  The Star in the East  At Sherburn Castle in Dorsetshire is a head of Elizabeth Wriothesley eldest daughter of Henry Earl of Southampton and wife of William Lord Spenser her head richly dressed and a picture in a blue enamelled case at her breast This picture is well coloured tho' not equal to another at the same seat a half length of her mother Elizabeth daughter of John Vernon wife of Earl Henry Her cloaths are magnificent and the attire of her head singular a veil turned quite back The face and hands are coloured with incomparable lustre and equal to any thing this master executed There is also a half length in black satten of John Digby first Earl of Bristol young and remarkably handsome It is ascribed to Jansen but is faintly coloured and evidently in the manner of Vandyck whom perhaps he imitated as well as rivalled  Jansen's fame declined  At Lord Pomfret's at Easton was a portrait of Charles I by Jansen  on the arrival of Vandyck and the civil war  breaking out Cornelius at the importunity of his wife quitted England His pass is recorded in the Journals of the Commons  October Ordered that Cornelius Johnson picturedrawer shall have Mr Speaker's warrant to pass beyond seas with Emanuel Passe George Hawkins and to carry with him such pictures and colours bedding houshold stuff pewter and brass as belongs unto himself  He retired first to Midelburg and then to Amsterdam where he continued to paint and died in  Sandrart p  His wife's name was Elizabeth Beck to whom he was married in They had a son Cornelius bred to his father's profession which he followed in Holland where he died poor being ruined by the extravagance of a second wife The son drew the Duke of Monmouth's picture as he was on the point of sailing for his unfortunate expedition to England  A sister of Cornelius Jansen the elder was second wife of  In the catalogue of King Charles's pictures is mentioned a portrait drawn by George Spence of Nuremberg and bought of Nicasius Russel p    Nicasius Russel or Roussel of Bruges jeweller to the Kings James and Charles the first They had many children To one of the sons born in Cornelius Jansen was godfather and the widow of Isaac Oliver godmother Theodore Russel an elder son was born in and lived nine years with his uncle Cornelius Jansen and afterwards with Vandyck whose pictures he copied very tolerably on small pannels many of them are in a private apartment at Windsor at Warwickcastle and in the collection of the Duchess Dowager of Argyle Russel chiefly was employed in the country in the families of the Earls of Essex and Holland and was a lover of his ease and his bottle  He was father of Antony Russel a painter from whom Vertue received these particulars and at whose house he saw a picture of Cornelius Jansen his wife and son drawn by Adrian Hanneman who courted Jansen's neice but was disappointed  DANIEL MYTENS  of the Hague was an admired painter in the reigns of King James and King Charles He had certainly studied the works of Rubens before his coming over his landscape in the back grounds of his portraits is evidently in the style of that school and some of his works have been taken for Vandyck's The date of his arrival is not certain probably it was in hopes of succeeding Van Somer but though he drew several of the court he was not formally employed as the King's painter 'till the reign of Charles His patent is preserved in Rymer's Foedera vol xviii p  I found the minute of the docquet warrant for this among the Conway papers in these words  The office of one of his majesty's picturedrawers in ordinary with the fee of  l

staff whole length A small bell on the table has these letters D M F It was more common for him to paint a slip of paper on his pictures inscribed only with the names or titles of the persons represented At Lady Elizabeth Germain's at Drayton is a very fine whole length of Henry Rich Earl of Holland in a striped habit with a walking stick At St James's  The picture of the Queen of Scots at St James's is a copy by Mytens  is Jeffery Hudson the dwarf holding a dog by a string in a landscape coloured warmly and freely like Snyder or Rubens Mytens drew the same figure in a very large picture of Charles I and his Queen which was in the possession of the late Earl of Dunmore but the single figure is much better painted The history of this diminutive personage was so remarkable that the reader will perhaps not dislike the digression  See Fuller and Wright's Rutlandshire  He was born at Oakham in Rutlandshire in and about the age of seven or eight being then but eighteen inches high was retained in the service of the Duke of Buckingham who resided at Burleigh on the Hill Soon after the marriage of Charles I the King and Queen being entertained at Burleigh little Jeffery was served up to table in a cold pye and presented by the Duchess to the Queen who kept him as her dwarf From seven years of age 'till thirty he never grew taller but after thirty he shot up to three feet

Minimus commonly called little Jeffery her majesty's servant c written by Microphilus with a little print of Jeffery prefixed Before this period Jeffery was employed on a negotiation of great importance He was sent to France to fetch a midwife for the Queen and on his return with this gentlewoman and her majesty's dancingmaster and many rich presents to the Queen from her mother Mary de Medici he was taken by the Dunkirkers  It was in Besides the present he was bringing for the Queen he lost to the value of  l  that he had received in France on his own account from the Queenmother and ladies of that court  Jeffery thus made of consequence grew to think himself really so He had born with little temper the teazing of the courtiers and domestics and had many squabbles with the King's gigantic porter  A basrelief of this dwarfand giant is to be seen fixed in the front of a house near the end of Bagniocourt on the east side of Newgatestreet Probably it was a sign Oliver Cromwell too had a porter of an enormous height whose standard is recorded by a large O on the back of the terrace at Windsor almost under the window of the gallery This man went mad and prophecied In Whitechapel was a sign of him taken from a print of St Peter  at last being provoked by Mr Crofts a young gentleman of family a challenge ensued and Mr Crofts coming to the rendezvous armed only with a squirt the little creature was so enraged that a real duel ensued and the appointment being on horseback with pistols to put them more  on a level Jeffery with the first fire shot his antagonist dead This happened in France whither he had attended his mistress in the troubles He was again taken prisoner by a Turkish rover and sold into Barbary He probably did not long remain in slavery for at the beginning of the civil war he was made a captain in the royal army and in attended the Queen to France where he remained 'till the restoration At last upon suspicion of his being privy to the Popish plot he was taken up in and confined in the gatehouse Westminster where he ended his life in the sixtythird year of his age  Mytens remained in great reputation 'till the arrival of Vandyck who being appointed the King's principal painter the former in disgust asked his majesty's leave to retire to his own country but the King learning the cause of his dissatisfaction treated him with much kindness and told him that he could find sufficient employment both for him and Vandyck Mytens consented to stay and even grew intimate it is probable with his rival for the head of  In some of the first impressions the name of Isaac appears in this plate instead of Daniel It was corrected afterwards  Mytens is one of those painted among the professors by that great master  Whether the same jealousy operated again or real decline of business influenced him or any other cause Mytens did not stay much longer in England We find none of his works here after the year Yet he lived many years afterwards Houbraken quotes a register at the Hague dated in at which time it says Mytens painted part of the cieling of the townhall there the subject is Truth writing history on the back of Fame  These were the most considerable painters in oil in the reign of James There were undoubtedly several others of inferior rank whose names are not come down to us except two or three and of one of those I find nothing but this short note from Baglione  Page  Christophano Roncalli pittore andò per la Germania per la Fiandra per l' Olanda per l'  Inghilterra  per la Francia e finalmente carico d' honori e di anni finì il corso  He died at Rome  I should not mention such slight notices but that they may lead to farther discoveries An other was a more remarkable person especially in the subsequent reign but in a work of this nature it is impossible not to run the subjects of one chapter into those of another taking care however to distribute them as they serve best to carry on the chronologic series His name was  ROBERT PEAKE  The earliest mention of him that appears is in the  They were in the collection of the late Dr Rawlinson  books of the Lord Harrington Treasurer of the Chambers No being accounts of monies received and paid by him  Item paid to Robert Peake picturemaker by warrant from the council October for three several pictures made by him at the commandment of the Duke of York his officers and given away and disposed of by the Duke's Grace twenty pounds  It does not appear whether these pictures were in oil or watercolours I should rather suppose portraits in miniature of King Charles the First then Duke of York but that Peake painted in oil is ascertained  PETER OLIVER  pinx TChambars sculp  by Peacham in his book of limning where he expresly celebrates his good friend  Mr Peake  and Mr Marquis  Of this man I find no other mention  for oilcolours Peacham himself was a limner as he tells us in the same book having presented a copy of his majesty's Basilicon Doron illuminated to Prince Henry  Peake was originally a pictureseller by Holbournbridge and had the honour of being Faithorn's master and what perhaps he thought a greater honour was knighted at Oxford March The disorders of the times confounding all professions and no profession being more bound in gratitude to take up arms in the defence of King Charles Sir Robert Peake entered into the service and was made a Lieutenantcolonel and had a command in Basinghouse when it was besieged where he persuaded his disciple Faithorn to inlist under him as the latter in his dedication of the art of graving to Sir Robert expresly tells him and where Peake himself was taken prisoner  See a Letter from Oliver Cromwell to the Speaker of the House of Commons on the reduction of Basinghouse Printed in the Annual Register for  He was buried in the chuch of St Stephen London  Payne Fisher's catal of monuments  Miniature makes a great figure in this reign by the lustre thrown on it by  PETER OLIVER  the eldest son of Isaac Oliver and worthy of being compared with his father In some respects the son even appears the greater master as he did not confine his talent to single heads Peter copied in watercolours several capital pictures with signal success By the catalogues  of King Charles I and King James II it appears that there were thirteen pieces of this master in the royal collection chiefly historic miniatures seven of them are still preserved in Queen Caroline's closet at Kensington At the Earl of Exeter's at Burleigh is the story of Venus and Adonis painted by Peter and dated Vertue mentions another which was in Mr Halsted's sale in May it represented Joseph the Virgin and the Child asleep eight inches wide and five high On it was written his name with the termination French P Olivier fecit Another piece a fine drawing in indian ink was copied by him from a picture of Raphael in the collection of King Charles St John presenting a cross to the child kneeling before the Virgin The original was sold after the King's death to the Spanish Embassador for  l  Jerome Laniere bought Peter's drawing and sold it for twenty guineas to Mr John Evelyn from whom it came to the present Sir John Evelyn The Duke of Devonshire has the portrait of Edward th when an infant the drapery highly ornamented and finished a copy from Holbein  In the first edition I by mistake ascribed this to Isaac Oliver but Peter's mark is upon it  Lady Elizabeth Germain has at Drayton the Madonna and Child The finest work of Peter Oliver in my opinion is the head of his own wife in the cabinet of the Duchess of Portland It is life itself I doubt whether his father ever excelled this piece I have a head of the same woman drawn with black lead on the leaf of a vellom pocketbook on the reverse is his own portrait in profile both masterly And in black and red chalk I have a boy's head larger than he generally painted of great nature and vivacity At Kensington below stairs is the portrait of Peter Oliver by Hanneman who painted the wise too but I know not where the latter is  It is extraordinary  Sir Andrew Fountaine lost many miniatures by a fire at White's original chocolate house in St James's street about thirty years ago where he had hired two rooms for a repository of part of his collection Probably some of the works of the Olivers of Cooper c were destroyed there  that more of the works  Peter Oliver etched a few small histories but Vertue does not specify the subjects  of this excellent master are not known as he commonly made duplicates of his pictures reserving one of each for himself On this subject Russel the painter related to or connected with the Olivers told Vertue a remarkable story The greater part of the collection of King Charles being dispersed in the troubles among which were several of the Olivers Charles II who remembered and was desirous of recovering them made many inquiries about them after the restoration At last he was told by one Rogers  Vertue says he was very great at court it was probably Progers well known for being employed in the King's private pleasures See Memoires de Grammont  of Isleworth that both the father and son were dead but that the son's widow was living at Isleworth and had many of their works The King went very privately and unknown with Rogers to see them the widow showed several finished and unfinished with many of which the King being pleased asked if she would sell them She replied she had a mind the King should see them first and if he did not purchase them she should think of disposing of them The King discovered himself on which she produced some more pictures which she seldom showed The King desired her to set her price she said she did not care to make a price with his majesty she would leave it to him but promised to look over her husband's books and let his majesty know what prices his father the late King had paid The King took  away what he liked and sent Rogers to Mrs Oliver with the option of  l  or an annuity of  l  for her life She chose the latter Some years afterwards it happened that the King's mistresses having begged all or most of these pictures Mrs Oliver who was probably a prude and apt to express herself like a prude said on hearing it that if she had thought the King would have given them to such whores and strumpets and bastards he never should have had them This reached the court the poor woman's salary was stopped and she never received it afterwards The rest of the limnings which the King had not taken fell into the hands of Mrs Russel's father  Peter Oliver says Vertue died about the year aged near but this must be a mistake as his father's drawing at Kensington finished by the son is dated when by that account Peter was not above twelve years old From his age and the story of his widow it is more likely that he died before the restoration Probably the date should be He was buried with his father in the Blacksryars  As in none of these accounts mention is made of any children of Peter Oliver I conclude that Isaac Oliver glasspainter born in was son of the younger brother James Among the verses printed by the university of Cambridge in on the death of Mr Edward King Milton's Lycidas one of the English copies is inscribed Isaac Oliver  Peck's life of Milton p  who I suppose was the glasspainter and then about the age of twentytwo as appears from the following inscription on a painted window in Christchurch Oxford  liver aetat suae anno pinxit deditque The story is St Peter delivered out of prison the drawing and execution good but the colouring in some parts faint  The long life of this person  After the fire of London he was employed jointly with Mr Hooke in surveying and laying out the ground for rebuilding the city See Biogr Britann vol iv p marginal note  estimable for his own merit and that of his family served almost alone to preserve the secret of painting on glassa secret which however has never been lost as I shall show in a moment by a regular series of the professors The first interruption given to it was by the reformation which banished the art out of churches yet it was in some measure kept up in the escutcheons of the nobility and gentry in the windows of their seats Towards the end of Queen Elizabeth it was omitted even there yet the practice did not entirely cease The chapel of our Lady at Warwick was ornamented anew by Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester and his Countess and the cypher of the glasspainter's name yet remains with the date and in some of the chapels at Oxford the art again appears dating itself in by the hand of no contemptible master I could supply even the gap of fortyeight years by many dates on Flemish glass but nobody ever supposed that the secret was lost so early as the reign of James I and that it has not perished since will be evident from the following series reaching to the present hour  The portraits in the windows of the library at AllSouls Oxford  In the chapel at Queen'scollege twelve windows dated  a cypher on the painted glass in the chapel at Warwick  The windows at Wadhamcollege the drawing pretty good and the colours fine by Bernard Van Linge  In the chapel at Lincoln'sinn a window with the name of Bernard This was probably the preceding Van Linge  In the chapel at Wroxton stories from the Bible by Bernard Van Linge  In Christchurch Oxford by Abraham Van Linge  In the church of St Leonard Shoreditch two windows by Baptista Sutton  The East window in the chapel at Universitycollege Hen Giles  In Mr Thoresby's museum was "the picture of Mr Henry Gyles called there the famous glass painter at York wrote in mezzotinto by the celebrated Mr Francis Place when that art was known to few others Bought with other curiosities by Mr Gyles's executors" See Thoresby's Ducatus Leodiensis page  pinxit There are eight or ten more dated  at Christchurch Isaac Oliver aged  Window in Mertonchapel William Price  He died in    Windows at Queen's Newcollege and Maudlin by William Price the son now living whose colours are fine whose drawing good and whose taste in ornaments and mosaic is far superior to any of his predecessors is equal to the antique to the good Italian masters and only surpassed by his own singular modesty  It may not be unwelcome to the curious reader to see some anecdotes of the revival of taste for painted glass in England Price as I have said was the only painter in that style for many years in England Afterwards one Rowell a p  mber at Reading did some things particularly for the late Henry Earl of Pembroke but Rowell's colours soon vanished At last he found out a very durable and b  tifull red but he died in a year or two and the secret with him A man at Birmingham began the same art in or and fitted up a window for Lord  in the church of Hagley but soon broke A little after him one Peckitt at York began the same business and has made good proficience A few lovers of the art collected some dispersed panes from ancient buildings particularly the late Lord Cobham who erected a gothic temple at Stowe and filled it with arms of the old Nobility c About the year one Asciotti an Italian who had married a Flemish woman brought a parcel of painted glass from Flanders and sold it for a very few guineas to the Hon Mr Bateman of Old Windsor Upon that I sent Asciotti again to Flanders who brought me pieces for which including the expence of his journey I paid him thirtysix guineas His wife made more journeys for the same purpose and sold her cargoes to one Palmer a glazier in St Martin'slane who immediately raised the price to one two five guineas for a single piece and fitted up entire windows with them and with mosaics of plain glass of different colours In  Paterson an auctioneer at Essexhouse in the Strand exhibited the first auctions of painted glass imported in like manner from Flanders All this manufacture consisted in rounds of scripturestories stained in black and yellow or in  of black and white birds and flowers in colours and Flemish coats of    HENRY GYLES  John  EDWARD NORGATE  though of a very inferior walk in the profession deserves to be remembered for his uncommon excellence in his way He was son of Dr Robert Norgate master of Bennetcollege Cambridge where Edward was born He was brought up by Nicholas Felton Bishop of Ely who married his mother and who observing his inclination to limning and heraldry permitted him to indulge his genius As he had good judgment in pictures he was sent into Italy by the great collector Thomas Earl of Arundel to purchase for him but returning by Marseilles and by some accident being disappointed of the remittances he expected and totally unknown there he was observed by a French gentleman  to walk many hours every day on the cours in a disconsolate manner The gentleman inquiring into his circumstances told him that perceiving he was able to walk at least twenty miles a day if he would set out on his journey homewards he would furnish him handsomely for a footman by which assistance Norgate arrived in his own country  Fuller's Worthies in Cambridgeshire  Among the accounts of the Lord Harrington quoted above is the following entry  Paid to Edward Norgate by warrant from the council April for his paynes taken to write and lymne in gold and colours certain letters written from his majesty to the King of Persia the sum of ten pounds  These letters were undoubtedly in answer to those brought by that singular adventurer Sir Antony Shirley embassador  from  the Sophy  to  his own sovereign  The warrant for restoring the use of the old English march which I have set forth in the Catalogue of Noble Authors was illuminated by this person but the best evidence of his abilities is a curious patent lately discovered The present Earl of Stirling received from a relation an old box of neglected writings among which he found the original commission of Charles I appointing his Lordship's predecessor Alexander Earl of Stirling commander in chief of NovaScotia with the confirmation of the grant of that province made by James I In the initial letter are the portraits of the King sitting on the throne delivering the patent to the Earl and round the border representations in miniature of the customs huntings fishings and productions of the country all in the highest preservation and so admirably executed that it was believed of the pencil of Vandyck But as I know no instance of that  master having painted in this manner I cannot doubt but it was the work of Norgate allowed the best illuminator of that age and generally employed says Fuller to make the initial letters in the patents of Peers and commissions of Embassadors Fuller concludes his account of him in these words "He was an excellent herald by the title of    It is extraordinary that Fuller who was acquainted with him did not know the title of his office It appears by the warrant for the march that Norgate was Windsorherald He was also clerk of the signet V Masters's History of Corpus Christi Coll Camb p  and which was the crown of all a right honest man Exemplary his patience in his sickness whereof I was an eye witness though a complication of diseases stone ulcer in the bladder c seized on him" He died at the Herald's office Dec  SOLOMON DE CAUS  a Gascon was Prince Henry's drawingmaster All  I have learnt that the front of Wilton by Inigo Jones was conducted by this De Caus  we know of him is that in the year of the Prince's death he published a book intituled La Perspective ou Raison des ombres et miroirs with several engraved plates folio It is addressed from Richmond palace to Prince Henry after he had been as he tells his Highness two or three years in his service and another tract in folio on mechanic powers  This young Prince was a great lover of the arts and laid the foundation of the collection which his brother compleated The medals were purchased by him and Vanderdort in his catalogue mentions several statues and pictures which King Charles inherited from Prince Henry In the appendix to Birch's life of this Prince are several letters  from Sir Edward Conway in one  Page  of which he mentions having bought a picture of the Four Evangelists whom he calls affectedly  the most faithfull glorious and excellent secretaries that ever were to tbe infinite incomprehensible Prince  desiring Mr Adam Newton  secretary to the most hopefull powerfull and glorious earthly Prince  to present it to his Royal Highness and in others is much talk of a negotiation in which he was employed by the same Prince to engage an eminent painter of Delft to come to England This was  Mireveldt  who had many sollicitations afterwards from King Charles on the same head but none succeeded The printed letters are from the Harleian MSS and describe Mireveldt as very fantastic and capricious Mr West has two others one from Mireveldt to Sir Edward Conway the other from Sir Edward in which appears the cause of Mireveldt's uncertainty he was afraid of being stayed in England by authority and stipulated that he should have liberty to return in three monthsIn he had again engaged to come but was prevented by the breaking out of the plague Mireveldt is said to have painted five thousand portraits there are some in England of his hand as Henry Earl of Southampton at Woburn Sir Ralph Winwood a fine whole length at Kimbolton of Robert Rich Earl of Warwick and a print of Robert Earl of Lindsey by Vorst was engraved from a picture of Mireveldt but these portraits must have been painted when those persons followed the wars and their business abroad  It was in the reign of King James that the  The art of

Hamptoncourt are some of the cartoons  The beautifull hangings at Lord Orford's at Houghton containing whole lengths of King James King Charles their Queens and the King of Denmark with heads of the

design the habits are of the court of Francis st and one of the months represents a Gentleman and Lady riding together to hawk  Of this person I find no farther record with relation to the arts but that he made a present to the King of a seapiece painted by Persellis and was dead when Vanderdort drew up the catalogue  King Charles's catalogue page He went to Paris to be cut for the stone in the bladder in and probably died there He was at that time engaged in a suit in the starchamber with Sir Robert Osborne an old servant of King James who had mortgaged to Crane for  l  the Royal manor of Grafton of which he was only tenant See Strafford papers vol i p He was sometime chancellor of the garter and founded five additional Almsknights by his will dated in See Aubrey's history of Surrey

officebook of the board of works  Maximilian Colte master sculptor at  l  a year  EPIPHANIUS EVESHAM  was another sculptor of that time In the translation of Owen's epigrams by John Penkethman printed in the translator says "give me leave to insert his Owen's epitaph which is engraved in a plate of brass and fixed under his monumental image formed and erected by that most exquisite artist Mr Epiphanius Evesham in the cathedral of St Paul"  NICHOLAS STONE  was the statuary most in vogue He was born at Woodbury near Exeter in and coming to London lived for some time with one Isaac James He then went to Holland where he worked for Peter de Keyser whose daughter he married and returning to England was employed in making monuments for persons of the first distinction  In he was sent to Edinburgh to work in the King's chapel there In he was engaged on the building of the banquettinghouse and in the beginning of the reign of King Charles he received his patent as master mason recorded in Rymer's Foedera  Vol xviii p  of which this is the substance "Know ye that we do give and graunt unto our trusty and wellbeloved servant Nicholas Stone the office and place of our master mason and

Besides these works Stone in undertook to build for the Earl of Holland at Kensington two piers of good Portland stone to hang a pair of great wooden gates the estimate of the piers which were designed by Inigo Jones and are still standing at Hollandhouse tho' removed to greater distance from each other was  l  He built the great gate of St Mary's church and the stone gates for the

pulpit in this church Mary his wife and Nicholas his son lye also buried in the same grave She died November th and He on the th of September H S posuit"  Stone had three sons Henry Nicholas and John The two eldest were sent to Italy to study the youngest was educated at Oxford being designed for a clergyman but in the civil war he entered into the army on the King's side During that period this John Stone published a book on fortification called Enchiridion with many small cuts etched by himself but without his name The King's forces being routed young Stone and a companion made their escape the latter was taken and hanged before his father's door in Smithfield but Stone hid himself in his father's house in Longacre for above a twelvemonth without the knowledge says Vertue of his father whence I suppose he had either offended the old man by quitting his studies for arms or the father was too prudent to risk the emoluments of his profession by engaging in partydissentions John at last found means of retiring to France where he lived some years and I conclude applied himself to the arts as we shall find him after his return engaged in his father's business Nicholas the second son was of a promising genius and while abroad modelled after the antiques so well that his works have been mistaken for the best Italian masters Mr Bird the statuary had  the Laocoon and Bernini's Apollo and Daphne in Terra cotta by this Nicholas Stone and Vertue saw a book with many of his drawings of palaces churches and other buildings in Italy He returned to England in and died the same year as his father  Henry the eldest son who erected the monument for his father mother and brother carried on in conjunction with John the business of statuary after his father's death though Henry addicted himself chiefly to painting and was an excellent copyist of Vandyck and the Italian masters He is generally known by the name of  Old Stone  I suppose to distinguish him from his brother John Henry wrote a book a thin folio entituled the third part of the art of painting taken mostly from the ancients Vertue who saw this book was uncertain whether the two former parts were composed by Stone or by some other author The accounts of Nicholas Stone sen which I have quoted above were continued by John while he and Henry worked in partnership among other articles are the following  "In the year of our Lord my brother and I made a tomb for the Lord Ashley for which we had  l  "Formerly I made a little tomb of white marble being an eagle with an escutcheon upon his breast sett up at Sunning in Barkshire for  l  "In Ano I sett up a little tomb in the Temple church for Sir John Williams and had for it  l  It was an eagle of white marble" There are but fifteen monuments entered in this account the prices of none of which rise above  l  Consequently the sons I suppose never attained the reputation of the father  A head of Sir Jonas Moore with a scroll of paper in his hand was  HENRY STONE  Lilly pinx Bannerman Sculp  engraved by T Cross in from a painting by Henry Stone  Ferdinado Boll the painter sent his own portrait to Henry Stone in exchange for his Boll's was sold to Counsellor Eades at Warwick in  whose house garden and workyard in Longacre the same that had been his father's were rented from the crown at  l  a year as appeared when surveyed in by the commissioners appointed to inspect the lands that had belonged to the King Henry Stone died in and was buried near his father where a monument was erected and this epitaph written for him by his brother John  "To the memory of Henry Stone of Longacre painter and statuary who having passed the greatest part of thirtyseven years in Holland France and Italy atchieved a fair renown for his excellency in arts and languages and departed this life on the th day of August A D and lyeth buried near the pulpit in this church  His friends bewail him thus  Could arts appease inexorable fate  Thou hadst survived this untimely date  Or could our votes have taken place the sun  Had not been set thus at it's glorious noon  Thou shouldst have lived such statues to have shown  As Michael Angelo might have wished his own  And still thy most unerring pencil might  Have rais'd his admiration and delight  That the beholders should inquiring stand  Whether 'twas Nature's or the Artist's hand  But thy too early death we now deplore  There was not art that thou couldst live to more  Nor could thy memory by age be lost  If not preserved by this pious cost  Thy name's a monument that will surpass  The Parian marble or Corinthian brass  John Stone to perfect his fraternal affections erected this monument"  And a little lower June  Four rare Stones are gone  The Father and three Sons  In memory of whom their near kinsman Charles Stoakes repaired this monument  John Stone the last of the family died soon after the Restoration and Stoakes the person abovementioned from whom Vertue learned all these circumstances came into possession of many drawings prints paintings models c particularly many portraits of the family in small by Henry Stone and from Stoakes the pictures fell into the hands of Mr Cock the auctioneer  BERNARD JANSEN  was an architect at the same time that Nicholas Stone was the fashionable statuary They were employed together as appears by the foregoing memorandums on the tomb of Mr Sutton the founder of the Charterhouse Of what country Jansen  Among the Harleian MSS No art are articles of agreement between Paul D'ewes  Esq  and Jan Jansen stonecuter for setting up a tomb in the church of Stowlangtost Dated June  was does not appear by both his names I conclude a foreigner and probably a Fleming as he was a professed imitator of Dieterling a famous builder in the Netherlands  who wrote several books on architecture Jansen was engaged on many great works  This account Vertue received from Stoakes the relation of Stone mentioned in the preceding article  here he built Audleyinn  AudleyInn near Walden in Essex was an immense pile of building the rooms large but some of them not lofty in proportion and a gallery of ninetyfive yards which with the chapel and great Council Chamber each projecting backwards from the ends of the gallery have been demolished The present chapel was lately fitted up The screen accompanying the ascent of steps from the hall was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and has no relation to the rest of the building That injudicious architect too advised the destruction of the first court which consisted of noble corridores supported by columns of alabaster in the room of which he built two ugly brick walls which cost  l  The marble pillars of the chapel were purchased by Lord Onslow King William bought thence some suits of tapestry now at Windsor for which he paid  l  The drawingroom called the fishroom is a noble chamber the cieling and a deep frieze adorned in stucco with seamonsters and great fishes swimming All the costly chimneypieces have been sold Over that in the gallery were the labours of Hercules and in the cieling the loves of the Gods Many of the friezes still extant are in very good taste It was erected by THOMAS Howard Earl of Suffolk Lord Treasurer in the reign of James I and was generally supposed to be founded on Spanish gold his Countess who had great sway with him being notoriously corrupt There is a whole length of her in the hall at Gorhambury She was mother of the memorable Frances Countess of Essex and Somerset whose escutcheon still remains entire in the chancel of the church at Walden one of the lightest and most beautifull parish churches I have seen  and the greater part of Northumberlandhouse except the frontispiece which Vertue discovered to be the work of the next artist  GERARD CHRISMAS  Before the portal of that palace was altered by the present Earl of Northumberland there were in a freeze near the top in large capitals C AE an enigma long inexplicable to antiquarians Vertue found that at the period when the house was built lived Chrismas an architect and carver of reputation who gave the design of Aldersgate and cut the basrelief on it of James I on horseback and thence concluded that those letters signified Chrismas aedificavit  In the new description of London vol it is said that from some letters on the front when it was last rebuilt it was inferred that one Moses Glover was the architect which is not improbable as that great curiosity at Sionhouse the survey of Sion and the neighbouring villages was performed by Moses Glover painter and architect  r In that valuable plan are views of the royal houses and seats in the neighbourhood  Jansen probably built the house which was of brick and the frontispiece which was of stone was finished by Chrismas The carvers of the great ship built at Woolwich by Mr Peter Pett in were John and Mathias Chrismas sons of Gerard  Vertue had seen a printed copy of verses in praise of the father  JOHN SMITHSON  was an architect in the service of the Earls of Newcastle He built part of Welbeck in the ridinghouse  As appears by his name over the gate  there in and the stables in and when William Cavendish Earl and afterwards  Duke of Newcastle proposed to repair and make great additions to Bolsovercastle Smithson it is said was sent to Italy to collect designs From them I suppose it was that the noble apartment erected by that Duke and lately pulled down was compleated Smithson dying in Many of Smithson's drawings were purchased by the late Lord Byron from his descendents who lived at Bolsover in the chancel of which church Smithson is buried with this inscription  Reader beneath this plain stone buried lies  Smithson's remainder of mortality  Whose skill in architecture did deserve  A fairer tomb his memory to preserve  But since his nobler works of piety  To God his justice and his charity  Are gone to heaven a building to prepare  Not made with hands his friends contented are  He here shall rest in hope 'till th' worlds shall burn  And intermingle ashes with his urn  Ob Decemb  His son a man of some skill in architecture was buried in the same grave  BUTLER  a name preserved only by Peacham in whose time Butler seems to have been still living for speaking of Architecture and of the Lord Treasurer Salisbury "who he adds as he favoureth all learning and excellency so he is a principal patron of this art having lately employed Mr Butler and many excellent artists for the beautifying his  especially his chapel at Hatfield  STEPHEN HARRISON  who calls himself joyner and architect invented the triumphal arches erected in London for the reception of James I They were engraved by Kip on a few leaves in folio a work I never saw but in the library at Chatsworth  I shall conclude what I have to say on the reign of King James with a brief account of a few of his medallists This article is one of the most deficient in Vertue's notes he had found but very slight materials though equally inquisitive on this head with the rest One must except the subject of the two Simons of whose works as he himself published a most curious volume I shall omit the mention of them in this catalogue only desiring that Vertue's account of the two Simons and Hollar and the catalogues of the collections of King Charles King James and the Duke of Buckingham may be regarded as parts of this his great design By those specimens one sees how perfect he wished and laboured to make the whole  I was in hopes of compleating this article by having recourse to Mr Evelyn's Discourse on Medals but was extremely disappointed to sind that in a folio volume in which he has given the plates and inscriptions of a regular series of our medals he takes not the least notice of the gravers I should not have expected that a virtuoso so knowing would have contented himself with descriptions of the persons represented he who had it in his inclination and generally in his power to inform posterity of almost every thing they would wish to learn Had Mr Evelyn never regretted his ignorance of the names of the workmen of those inimitable medals of the Seleucidae of the fair  coins of Augustus and of the Denarii of the other Roman Emperors Was he satisfied with possessing the effigies of Tiberius Claudius Irene without wishing to know the names of the ingenious and more harmless graversWhy did he think posterity would not be as curious to learn who were the medallists of Charles II James I Mary I He has omitted all names of gravers except in two or three of the plates and even there says not a word of the artist For instance in a medal of Charles I p under the King's bust are the letters N R F I cannot discover who this N R was  Unless it was Norbert Rotier who arrived in the reign of Charles II In that case the medal in question must have been executed after the Restoration  Thomas Rawlins was a graver of the mint about that time perhaps he had a brother who worked in partnership with him I was so surprized at this omission that I concluded Mr Evelyn must have treated of the gravers in some other part of the work I turned to the index and to my greater surprize found almost every thing but what I wanted In the single letter  N  which contains but twentysix articles are the following subjects which I believe would puzzle any man to guess how they found their way into a discourse on medals  Nails of the cross  Negros  Narcotics  Neocoros  Nations whence of such various dispositions  Nightingale  Noah  Natural and artificial curiosities  Noses  Navigation  Nurses of what importance their temper and dispositions  Neapolitans their character  In short Mr Evelyn who loved to know was too fond of telling  the world all he knew  Among other branches of science if one can call it so Mr Evelyn studied Physiognomy and found dissimulation boldness cruelty and ambition in every touch and stroke of Fuller's picture of Oliver Cromwell's face which he says was the most resembling portrait of the Protector In Vandyck's Earl of Strafford a steady serious and judicious countenance and so in many others whose characters from knowing their history he fancied he saw in their features How his divination would have been puzzled if he had been shown a picture of Cromwell in the contemptible appearance which Sir Philip Warwick says he made at his first entry into the House of Commons Or if my Lord Strafford had continued to oppose the court and had never changed sides would Mr Evelyn have sound his countenance so STEADY and JUDICIOUS  His virtue industry ingenuity and learning were remarkable one wishes he had written with a little more judgmentor perhaps it is not my interest to wish so it would be more prudent to shelter under his authority any part of this work that is not much to the purpose  All this author says  Page  of our medallists is that we had Symons Rawlins Mr Harris Christian c and then refers us to his Chalcography  Page  where indeed he barely names two more Restrick and Johnson of whom I can find no other account The reader must therefore accept what little is scattered up and down in Vertue's MSS I have already mentioned one or two in the preceding volume The first graver I meet in the reign of James is  CHARLES ANTONY  to whom Sir Thomas Knyvet master of the mint in the second of that  King paid by warrant  l  for gold and workmanship for graving an offering piece of gold Anthony having then the title of the King's graver  I have a thin plate of silver larger than a crown piece representing King James on his throne It is very neat workmanship and probably by this Antony  Vertue supposes this person made the medal in on the peace with Spain a medal not mentioned by Evelyn and that he continued in office 'till Mr Anstis informed him of a warrant to a brother of Charles Antony called  THOMAS ANTONY  curatori monetae et sigillorum regis ad cudendum magnum sigillum pro episcopatu et comitatu palatino Dunelm But of neither of these brothers do I find any other traces  THOMAS BUSHELL  was probably a medallist of the same age In the year Mr Compton produced at the Antiquarian Society as I find by their minutes a gold medal larger than a crown piece on one side Lord Chancellor Bacon in his hat and robes with this legend Bacon Viceco Sct Alb Angliae Cancell On the reverse Thomas Bushell Deus est qui clausa recludit  NICHOLAS BRIOT  was a native of Lorrain and graver of the mint to the King of France in which kingdom he was the inventor or at least one of the first proposers  of coining money by a press instead of the former manner of hammering As I am ignorant myself in the mechanic part of this art and have not even the pieces quoted by Vertue I shall tread very cautiously and only transcribe the titles of some memorials which he had seen and from whence I conclude a litterary controversy was carried on in France on the subject of this new invention to which according to custom the old practicioners seem to have objected as probably interfering with the abuses of which they were in prescriptive possession  Raisons de Nicolas Briot tailleur et graveur des monoyes de France pour rendre et faire toutes les monoyes du royaume à l'advenir uniformes et semblables c  Les remonstrances faites par la cour des monoyes contre la nouvelle

composè par Nicolas Coquerel This Coquerel I find by another note was Generalis monetarius or Pope of the mint into which the reformation was to be introduced The Luther Briot I suppose miscarried as we soon afterwards find him in the service of the crown of England where projectors were more favorably received From these circumstances I conclude he arrived in the reign of King James though he did not make his way to court before the accession of King Charles the patron of genius Briot's first public work was a medal of that Prince exhibited in Evelyn with the artist's name and the date To all or to almost all his coins and medals he put at least the initial letter of his name He was employed both in England and Scotland In as appears by  Rymer's Foedera tom xix p a special commission was appointed for making trial of the experience skill and industry of Nicholas Briot in the coinage of money at the mint dated June at Westminster This was the project he had attempted in France by instruments mills and presses to make better money and with less expence to the crown than by the way of hammering The scheme was probably approved for in the very next year we find him coining money upon the regular establishment There is extant a parchment roll containing the accounts of Sir Robert Harley Knight of the Bath master worker of his majesty's monies of gold and silver within the tower of London in the reign of King Charles I from November to August In this account in are payments to Briot for coining various parcels of gold and silver which are followed by this entry  "And delivered to his majestie in fair silver monies at Oatlands by Sir Thomas Aylesbury viz iij crownes and iij half crownes of Briot's moneys and iij crownes and iij half crownes and ten shillings of the monoyers making"  These comparative pieces were probably presented to the King by Sir Robert Harley Briot's patron to show the superior excellence of the latter's method  Briot returned to France about having formed that excellent scholar Thomas Simon  In a private family the name of which he does not mention Vertue saw a peachstone on which was carved the head of King Charles full faced with a laurel and on the reverse St George on horseback with the garter round it and on one side above the King's head these letters  The tradition in that family was that the carver having been  removed from the service of the crown and at last obtaining the place of poor Knight at Windsor cut that curiosity to show he was not superannuated nor incapable of his office as he had been represented If the mark  signified Nicholas Briot as is probable either the story is fictitious or Briot did not return to France on the breaking out of the civil war The latter is most likely as in the Treasury

of the King's Collection and of the Earl of Arundel's  THE accession of this Prince was the first aera of real taste in England As his temper was not profuse the expence he made in collections and the rewards he bestowed on men of true genius and merit are proofs of his judgment He knew how and when to bestow Queen Elizabeth was avaricious with pomp James I lavish with meanness A prince who patronizes the arts and can distinguish abilities enriches his country and is at once generous and an oeconomist Charles had virtues to make a nation happy fortunate if he had not thought that he alone knew how to make them happy and that he alone ought to have the power of making them so  His character as far as it relates to my subject is thus given by Lilly "He had many excellent parts in nature was an excellent  horseman would shoot well at a mark had singular skill in limning was a good judge of pictures a good mathematician not unskillfull in music well read in divinity excellently in history and law he spoke several languages and writ well good language and style" Perinchief is still more particular "His soul says that writer was stored with a full knowledge of the nature of things and easily comprehended almost all kinds of arts that either were for delight or of a public use for he was ignorant of nothing but of what he thought it became him to be negligent for many parts of learning that are for the ornament of a private person are beneath the cares of a crowned head He was well skilled in things of antiquity could judge of medals whether they had the number of years they pretended unto his libraries and cabinets were full of those things on which length of time put the value of rarities In painting he had so excellent a fancy that he would supply the defect of art in the workman and suddenly draw those lines give those airs and lights which experience and practice had not taught the painter He could judge of fortifications and censure whether the cannon were mounted to execution or no He had an excellent skill in guns knew all that belonged to their making The exactest arts of building ships for the most necessary uses of strength or good sailing together with all their furniture were not unknown to him He understood and was pleased with the making of  Mr Oughtred made a horizontal instrument for delineating dials for him "Elias Allen says that celebrated mathematician having been sworn his majesty's servant had a purpose to present his majesty with some newyear's gift and requested me to devise some pretty instrument for him I answered that I have heard that his majesty delighted much in the great concave dial at Whitehall and what fitter instrument could he have than my horizontal which was the very same represented in flat" Biogr Brit vol p Delamain another mathematician made a ring dial for the King which his majesty valued so much that on the morning before he was beheaded he ordered it to be given to the Duke of York with a book showing it's use ib p  clocks and watches  He comprehended the art of printing There was not any one gentleman of all the three kingdoms that could compare with him in an universality of knowledge He encouraged all the parts of learning and he delighted to talk with all kind of artists and with so great a facility did apprehend the mysteries of their professions that he did sometimes say "He thought he could get his living if necessitated by any trade he knew of but making of hangings" although of these he understood much and was greatly delighted in them for he brought some of the most curious workmen from foreign parts to make them here in England"  Life of Charles I at the end of the Icon Basilike edit  With regard to his knowledge of pictures I find the following anecdote from a book called the original and growth of printing by Richard Atkyns  Esq  "This excellent Prince says that author who was not only aliquis in omnibus but singularis in omnibus hearing of rare heads painted amongst several other pictures brought me from Rome sent Sir James Palmer to bring them to Whitehall to him where were present divers picturedrawers and painters He asked them all of whose hand that was some guest at it others were of another opinion but none was positive At last said the King This is of such a man's hand I know it as well as if I had seen him draw it but said he is there but one man's hand in this picture None did discern whether there was or not but most concluded there was but one hand  Said the King "I am sure there are two hands have workt in it for I know the hand that drew the heads but the hand that did the rest I never saw before" Upon this a gentleman that had been at Rome about ten years before affirmed that he saw this very picture with the two heads unfinished at that time and that he heard his brother who staid there some years after him say that the widow of the painter that drew it wanting money got the best master she could find to finish it and make it saleable" This story which in truth is but a blind one especially as Mr Atkyns does not mention even the name of the painter of his own picture seems calculated to prove a fact of which I have no doubt his majesty's knowledge of hands The gentleman who stood by and was so long before he recollected so circumstantial a history of the picture was I dare say a very good courtier  The King is said not only to have loved painting but to have practiced it it is affirmed that Rubens corrected some of his  De Piles in his life of Rubens says that the King's motherinlaw Mary de' Medici designed well  majesty's drawings  It was immediately after his accession that Charles began to form his collection The crown was already in possesssion of some good pictures Henry VIII had several What painters had been here had added others Prince Henry as I have said had begun a seperate collection both of paintings and statues All these Charles assembled and sent commissions into France and Italy to purchase more Cross  Vincentio Carducci in his dialogo della pittura printed at Madrid in calls him Michael de la Crux others say it was Henry Stone jun who was sent to Spain When Charles was at that court the King of Spain gave him a celebrated picture by Titian called the Venus del Pardo see catal p and the Cain and Abel by John of Bologna which King Charles afterwards bestowed on the Duke of Buckingham who placed it in the garden of Yorkhouse See Peacham p From Whitlocke p we have the following information "In December the Queen was brought to bed of a second daughter named Elizabeth To congratulate her majesty's safe delivery the Hollanders sent hither a solemn ambassy and a noble present a large piece of ambergrease two fair china basons almost transparent a curious clock and four rare pieces of Tintoret's and Titian's painting Some supposed that they did it to ingratiate the more with our King in regard his fleet was so powerfull at sea and they saw him resolved to maintain his right and dominion there"  was dispatched into Spain to copy the works of Titian there and no doubt  as soon as the royal taste was known many were brought over and offered to sale at court The ministers and nobility were not backward with presents of the same nature Various are the accounts of the jewels and bawbles presented to magnificent Elizabeth In the catalogue of King Charles's collection are recorded the names of several of the court who ingratiated themselves by offerings of pictures and curiosities But the noblest addition was made by the King

away with him a bust of a woman modelled in wax as large as the life which he had begun for that monarch but Prince Henry was so struck with it that though the Emperor wrote several times for it the young Prince would neither part with the work nor the workman telling him he would give him as good entertainment as any Emperor wouldand indeed Vanderdort seems to have made no bad bargain He parted with the bust to the Prince upon condition that as soon as the cabinet then building from a design of Inigo Jones should be finished he should be made keeper of his Royal Highness's medals with a

recommended to him to take particular care of a miniature by Gibson the parable of the lost sheep Vanderdort laid it up so carefully that when the King asked him for it he could not find it and hanged

majesty was desirous too of having something of the hand of Bernini Vandyck drew in one piece the full face and the three quarter face and the profile of the King from which Bernini made a bust that was consumed or stolen in the fire of Whitehall  It is very uncertain what became of this bust Vertue from several circumstances which I shall lay before the reader believed it was not destroyed Cooper the printseller told him that he had often heard Norrice framemaker to the court and who saved several of the pictures averr that he was in the room where the bust used to stand over a corner chimney and that it was taken away before that chamber was destroyed Lord Cutts who commanded the troops was impatient to blow up that part and yet after he had ordered the drums to beat it was half an hour before the explosion was begun time enough to have saved the bust if it was not stolen before Sir John Stanley then deputychamberlain was of the latter opinion He was at dinner in Craigcourt when the fire began which was about three o'clock He immediately went to the palace and perceived only an inconsiderable smoke in a garret not in the principal building He found Sir Christopher Wren and his workmen there and the gates all shut Looking at Bernini's bust he begged Sir Christopher to take care of That and the statues The latter replied "Take you care of what you are concerned in and leave the rest to me" Sir John said it was above five hours after this before the fire reached that part Norrice afterwards dug in the ruins of that chamber but could not discover the least fragment of marble The crouching Venus in the same apartment was known to be stolen being discovered after a concealment of four years and retaken by the crown Vertue thought that the brazen bust of King Charles in the passage near Westminsterhall was not taken from Bernini's of which casts are extant but of an earlier date In the imperial library at Vienna says Dr Edward Brown in his travels is a head of King Charles in white marble but this cannot be Bernini's as Brown wrote in and the fire of Whitehall happened in  It was on  seeing this picture that Bernini pronounced as is well known that there was something unfortunate in the countenance of Charles The same artist made a bust too of Mr Baker who carried the picture to Rome The Duke of Kent's father bought the latter bust at Sir Peter Lely's sale it is now in the possession of Lord Royston and was reckoned preferable to that of the King The hair is in prodigious quantity and incomparably loose and free the pointband very fine Mr Baker paid Bernini an hundred broad pieces for his but for the King's Bernini received a thousand Roman crowns The King was so pleased with his own that he desired to have one of the Queen too but that was prevented by the war  In the church at Chelsea is a fine monument in a niche for the Lady Jane Cheyney she is represented lying on her right side and leaning on a bible This tomb was the work of Bernini and cost  l  Among the Strafford papers is an evidence of this Prince's affection for his pictures In a  Page vol ii  letter from Mr Garrard dated November speaking of two masks that were to be exhibited that winter he says "A great room is now  Journal of the House of Commons July Ordered that the boarded masquehouse at Whitehall the masquehouse at St James's and the courts of guard be forthwith pulled down and sold away  building only for this use betwixt the guardchamber and banquettinghouse of fir only weatherboarded and slightly covered At the marriage of the Queen of Bohemia I saw one set up there but not of that vastness that this is which will cost too  much money to be pulled down and yet down it must when the masks are over"  In another of December the same person says "Here are two masks intended this winter the King is now in practicing his which shall be presented at Twelfthtide most of the young Lords about the town who are good dancers attend his majesty in this business The other the Queen makes at Shrovetide a new house being erected in the first court at Whitehall which cost the King  l  only of deal boards because the King will not have his pictures in the banquettinghouse hurt with lights"  The most capital purchase made by King Charles were the cartoons of Raphael now at Hamptoncourt They had remained in Flanders from the time that Leo X sent them thither to be copied in tapestry the money for the tapestry having never been paid Rubens told the King of them and where they were and by his means they were bought  It may be of use to collectors and virtuosi for whose service this work is composed to know when they meet with the ruins of that royal cabinet or of the Earl of Arundel's On the King's pictures was this mark  or  on his drawings a large star thus  on the Earl's a smaller  The dials at Whitehall were erected by the order of Charles while he was Prince Mr Gunter drew the lines and wrote the description and use of them printed in a small tract by order of King James in There were five dials afterwards some were made of glass in a pyramidal shape by Francis Hill and placed in the same garden One or two of these may still be extant Vertue saw them at Buckinghamhouse in St James's park from whence they were sold  It looks as if Charles had had some thoughts of erecting a monument for his father In the lodgings of the warden of Newcollege Oxford was a mausoleum with arms altartomb columns and inscriptions in honour of that Prince dated It is certain King Charles had no less inclination for architecture than for the other arts The intended palace at Whitehall would have been the most truly magnificent and beautifull fabric of any of the kind in Europe His majesty did not send to Italy and Flanders for architects as he did for Albano and Vandyck He had Inigo Jones Under the direction of that genius the King erected the house at Greenwich  Charles had in his service another man both architect and painter of whom though excellent in neither branch the reader will perhaps not dislike some account as he was a remarkable person and is little known  Sir Balthazar Gerbier D'ouvilly of Antwerp was born about came young into England and was a retainer of the Duke of Buckingham as early as In Finette's master of the ceremonies it is said "Alonzo Contarini Embassador from Venice came to Mr Gerbier a gentleman serving the Duke of Buckingham" Sanderson  Graphice page  calls him a common penman who pensiled the dialogue probably the decalogue in the Dutch church London his first rise of preferment" It is certain that he ingratiated himself much with that favorite and attended him into Spain where he was even employed in the treaty of marriage though ostensibly acting only in the character of a painter  He painted small figures in distemper De Piles While in Spain he drew the Infanta in miniature which was sent over to King James  Among the Harleian MSS is a letter from the Duchess of Buckingham to her  S  R  BALTHAZAR GERBIER  Vandyck pinx TChambars sculp  Lord in Spain "I pray you if you have any idle time  In a letter dated it is said the King and Queen were

catalogue of the Duke's collection drawn up by Gerbier who had been employed by the Duke in several of the purchases However there is some appearance of his having fallen into disgrace with his patron In one of Vertue's MSS is a passage that seems to be an extract though the author is not quoted in which the Duke treats Gerbier with the highest contempt The transcript is so obscure and imperfect that I shall give it in Vertue's own words  "King James I ill and dying the Duke of Buckingham was advised to apply a plaister to his stomach which he did with proper advice of doctors physicians of the King But the King dying the Duke was blamedone Eglesham printed a scurrilous  The title was "The Forerunners of Revenge in two petitions the one to the King the other to the Parliament concerning

charges  to imprint his recantation of which the Duke bid Gerbier join malice and knavery together and spit their venom 'till they split and he would pay for printing that also"  Nothing can be built upon so vague a foundation It is certain that immediately after the accession of King Charles Gerbier was employed in Flanders to negotiate privately a treaty with Spain the very treaty in which Rubens was commissioned on the part of the Infanta and for which end that great painter came to England Among the Conwaypapers I found a very curious and long letter from Gerbier himself on this occasion which though too prolix to insert in the body of this work I shall affix at the end not only as pertinent to my subject from the part these painters had in so important a business but as it is more particular than any thing I know in print on that occasion  Gerbier kept his ground after the death of Buckingham In he was knighted at Hamptoncourt and as he says himself in one of his books was promised by King Charles the office of surveyorgeneral of the works after the death of Inigo Jones  In he seems to have been employed in some other private transactions of state negotiating with the Duke of Orleans the King's brother who was discontented with the court The Earl of Leicester Embassador to Paris writes  Sidney papers vol ii p In one of his dedications mentioned hereafter Gerbier puts this Lord in mind of his having been in a publick employment when his Lordship was at Paris and De Piles says that the Duke of Buckingham finding him a man of good understanding recommended him to the King who sent him as his agent to Brussels  to Mr Secretary Windebank Nov "I received a packet from Garbier to Monsieur d d French King's brother  July he took the oaths of allegiance and supremacy having a bill of naturalization  Journals of the Commons  From that time to the death of the  King I find no mention of him though I do not doubt but a man of so supple and intriguing a nature so universal an undertaker did not lie still in times of such dark and busy complection However whether miscarrying or neglected  Vertue says he was much hated and persecuted by the antimonarchic party being always loyal and faithfull to the King and his son which may explain and soften what is said above of  his testimony being odious to any man  He bought goods at King Charles's sale to the value of  l  in he appears not only in the character of author but founder of an academy In that year he published a thin quarto intituled The interpreter of the academie for

rhapsody and deserved the sarcasm that Butler passed on so incompetent  For instance he translates Arcadia Orcadys  an attempt In his fictitious will of Philip Earl of Pembroke that Lord is made to say "All my other speeches of what colour soever I give to the academy to help Sir Balthazar's art of wellspeaking"  In he published the  So Vertue calls it but it is probably a mistake Mr Masters

to the right high and supreame Power of this Nation the Parliament of England c dated Jan  first lecture of Geography read at Sir Balthazar Gerbier's academy at Bednalgreen by which it seems that at  least his institution was opened This piece I have not seen nor the next though from Vertue's extract one learns another singular anecdote of this projector's history  "Sir Balthazar Gerbier's manifestation of greater profits to be done in the hot than the cold parts of America Rotterdam Wherein is set forth that he having a commission to go there settle and make enquirys he went to  Cajana  Cayenne with his family and settled at Surinam A governor there from the Dutch had orders to seize upon him and all his papers and bring him back to Holland which they did in a very violent manner breaking into his house killed one of his children endangered the lives of the rest of his family and narrowly escaped himself with his life having a pistol charged at his breast if he had resisted They brought him to Holland He complained but got no redress the states disowning they had given any such orders However it was just before the restoration and knowing the obligations he had to England they apprehended he might give the King notice of the advantages might be gained by a settlement there"  This perhaps was one among the many provocations which meeting his inclinations to France led Charles II into his impolitic though otherwise not wholly unjustifiable war with Holland a people too apt even in their depressed state to hazard barbarous and brutal infraction of treaties and humanity when a glimpse of commercial interest invites it  Gerbier probably returned to England with that Prince for the triumphal arches erected for his reception are said to have been designed by Sir Balthazar  In France he published a book on fortification and in at London a small discourse on magnificent buildings dedicated to the  King in which he principally treats of solidity convenience and ornament and glances at some errors of Inigo Jones in the banquettinghouse Here too he mentions a large room built by himself near the watergate  The gate itself was designed by Inigo  at Yorkstairs thirtyfive feet square and says that King Charles I being in it in at some representation of scenery commended it and expressed as much satisfaction with it as with the banquettinghouse In the piece he proposes to the Lords and Commons to level the streets Fleetbridge and Cheapside and erect a sumptuous gate at Templebar of which he had presented a draught to his majesty Before this book is a different print of him with a ribband and a medal inscribed C R The medal I suppose was given him when appointed as he says he was Master of the Ceremonies to Charles I  His portrait in one piece with Sir Charles Cotterel and Dobson painted by the latter is at Northumberlandhouse Gerbier has been mistaken in that picture for Inigo Jones This piece was bought for  l  at the sale of Betterton the player  Gerbier's last piece is a small manual intituled Counsel and Advice to all builders c London A full half of this little piece is wasted on dedications of which there are no fewer than forty and which he excuses by the example of Antonio Perez They are addressed to the Queenmother Duke of York and most of the principal Nobility and Courtiers The last is to his own disciple Captain William Wind There is a heap of a kind of various knowledge even in these dedications and some curious things as well as in the book itself particularly the prices of work and of all materials

Radnor's sale and which Mr Scawen  It was again exposed at Mr Scawen's sale but bought in and has since been purchased by Sampson Gideon  bought at a still greater price was the same with this picture but not so large nor containing so many figures Mr Scawen's had always passed for a mistress and children of the Duke of Buckingham but Vertue discovered on that of the Prince of Wales  an almost effaced inscription written by Vandyck's own hand with these words remaining La famille de BalthazarChevalier and he showed the Prince that the arms on a flowerpot were the same with those on two different prints of Gerbier and allusive to his name viz a chevron between three garbs or sheafs There is a group of children on the right hand very inferior to the rest of the composition and certainly not by Vandyck The little girl leaning on the mother's knee was originally painted by Rubens in a separate piece formerly belonging to Richardson the painter since that to General Skelton

little edition of Busbequius's Epistles printed at Oxford is the grant of a coat of arms to the regent and professors of the Museum Minervae from Sir John Burroughs the herald dated which arms are prefixed to the rules and orders of that establishment printed Previous to it's being set on foot a committee had been appointed in the House of Lords consisting of the Duke of Buckingham and others for taking into consideration the state of the public schools and method of education What progress was made by this committee is not known but probably the Museum Minervae owed it's rise to it  But it fell to the ground with the rest of the King's  plans and attemptsand so great was the inveteracy to him that it seems to have become part of the religion of the time to war on the arts because they had been countenanced at court The parliament began to sell the pictures at Yorkhouse so early as but lest the necessity of their affairs should not be thought sufficient justification they coloured it over with a piece of fanatic bigotry that was perfectly ridiculous passing the following votes among others July  Journal of the Commons  Ordered that all such pictures and statues there Yorkhouse as are without any superstition shall be forthwith sold for the benefit of Ireland and the North  Ordered that all such pictures there as have the representation of the second person in trinity upon them shall be forthwith burnt  Ordered that all such pictures there as have the representation of the Virgin Mary upon them shall be forthwith burnt  This was a worthy contrast to Archbishop Laud who made a starchamberbusiness of a man who broke some painted glass in the cathedral at Salisbury The cause of liberty was then and is always the only cause that can excuse a civil war yet if Laud had not doated on trifles and the presbyterians been squeamish about them I question whether the nobler motives would have had sufficient influence to save us from arbitrary power They are the slightest objects that make the  deepest impression on the people They seldom fight for a liberty of doing what they have a right to do but because they are prohibited or enjoined some folly that they have or have not a mind to do One comical instance of the humour of those times I find in Aubrey's history of Surrey  Vol ii page  one Bleese was hired for halfacrown a day to break the painted glass windows of the church of Croydon The man probably took care not to be too expeditious in the destruction  Immediately after the death  I cannot help inserting a short remark here though foreign to the purpose The very day after the execution of the King was passed this vote "Ordered That the Lord Grey be desired out of Haberdasher'shall to dispose of one hundred pounds for the service of the commonwealth  as he shall think fit  and that the committee at Haberdasher'shall be required forthwith to pay the same to the said Lord Grey for that purpose" This order is so covertly worded without any particular application at the same time that the sum is so small for any public service that joined to the circumstance of time and the known zeal of the paymaster I cannot doubt but this was intended for the reward of the executioner Mr West has an authentic account of the execution in which it is said that Richard Brandon the executioner having sound in the King's pocket an orange stuck with cloves was offered shillings for it which he refused but sold it for ten on his way home  of the King several votes were passed for sale of his goods pictures statues c  Feb It was referred to the committee of the navy to raise money by sale of the crown jewels hangings and other goods of the late King  Two days after Cromwell who as soon as he was possessed of the sole power

this order  That the care of the public library at St James's and of the statues and pictures there be committed to the council of state to be preserved by them  However in the ensuing month  March  the house proceeded to vote that the personal estate  Somersethouse had a narrow escape during that lust of destruction of which an account is preserved in a very scarce tract intituled "An Essay on the wonders of God in the harmony of the times that preceded Christ and how they met in him written in French by John D'Espagne minister of the gospel who died in and now published in English by his executor Henry Browne London octavo" In the preface the editor tells us "that the author preached at the French church in Durhamhouse where his sermons were followed by many of the nobility and gentry That demolished he says it pleased God to touch the hearts of the nobility to procure us an order of the House of Peers to exercise our devotions at Somersethousechapel which was the cause not only of driving away the Anabaptists Quakers and other sects that had got in there but also hindered the pulling down of Somersethouse there having been twice an order from the late usurped powers for selling the said house but we prevailed so that we still got order to exempt the chapel from being sold which broke the design of those that had bought the said house who thought for their improvement to have

be inventoried appraised and sold except such parcels of them as should be thought fit to be reserved for the use of the state and it was referred  to the council of state to consider and direct what parcels of the goods and personal estates aforesaid were fit to be reserved for the use of the state Certain commissioners were at the same time appointed to inventory secure and appraise the said goods and others  not members of the house  were appointed to make sale of the said estates to the best value The receipts were to go towards satisfying the debts and servants of the King Queen and Prince provided such servants had not been delinquents the rest to be applied to public uses the first thirty thousand pounds to be appropriated to the navy This vote in which they seem to have acted honestly not allowing their own members to be concerned in the sale was the cause that the collection fell into a variety of low hands and were dispersed among the painters and officers of the late King's houshold where many of them remained on sale with low prices affixed The principal pieces were rated more highly and some of them were even sold above their valuation  Ireton on the d of June reported the act for sale and mention is made of some proposition of Captain Myldmay concerning the pictures and statues to be referred to the council of state This proposal it seems had been accepted but was revoked Probably this person might be an agent of Cromwell to prevent the dispersion Cromwell had greater matters to attend to the sale proceeded Two years afterwards viz in October and November the journals speak of sums of money received from the sale of the King's goods and of various applications of the money towards discharge of his debts From that time I find no farther mention of the collection in the records  With regard to the jewels the parliament immediately after the King's death ordered the crown and sceptres c to be locked up  The Queen had already sold several jewels abroad to raise money and buy arms Some had been sold in foreign countries early in the King's reign particularly what was called the inestimable collar of rubies  There is a long warrant in Rymer directing the delivery of this collar there termed  the great collar of ballast rubies  and sundry other valuable jewels to the Duke of Buckingham and Earl of Holland to be disposed of by them beyond the seas according to private orders which they had received from his majesty The whole piece is curious and mentions the danger there might be to the keepers of those jewels to let them go out of their hands  as they were of great value and had long contynued as it were in a continual discent for many years togeather with the crowne of England  Foedera vol xviii p In Thoresby's Museum was

engraving so hard a jewel but says Tavernier I did not dare to own to whom it belonged remembring what had formerly happened to the Chevalier de Reville on the subject of that King The story as he had related it before in book ii chap was that Reville having told the Sophy that he had commanded a company of guards in the service of Charles and being asked why he came into Persia replied that it was to dissipate the chagrin he felt on his master being put to death and that since that time he cou'd not endure to live in Christendom The Sophy fell into a rage and asked Reville how it was possible if he was captain of the King's guards that he and all his men shou'd not have shed the last drop of their blood in defence of their Prince Reville was thrown into prison and remained there days and escaped at last by the intercession of the Sophy's eunuchsHad all Charles's soldiers been as loyal as the Persian Monarch thought it their duty to be we might now have the glory of being as faithfull slaves as the Asiatics  A catalogue of the pictures statues goods tapestries and jewels with the several prices at which they were valued and sold was discovered some years ago in Moorfields and fell into the hands of the late Sir John Stanley who permitted Mr Vicechamberlain Cook Mr Fairfax and Mr Kent to take copies from one of which Vertue obtained a transcript The particulars are too numerous to insert here The total of the contracts amounted to  l    s    d  Thirty one pages at the beginning relating to the plate and jewels were wanting and other pages here and there were missing Large quantities were undoubtedly secreted and embezzled and part remained unsold by the accession of Cromwell who lived both at Whitehall and Hamptoncourt All other furniture from all the King's palaces was brought up and exposed to sale there are specified particularly Denmark or Somersethouse Greenwich  Among the pictures from Greenwich is mentioned one piece of writing by Holbein sold for ten pounds I know not what this writing was  Whitehall Nonsuch Oatlands Windsor Wimbletonhouse St James's Hamptoncourt Richmond Theobald's  Ludlow Carisbrook and Kenelworth castles Bewdleyhouse Holdenbyhouse Royston Newmarket and Woodstock manorhouse One may easily imagine that such a collection of pictures with the remains of jewels and plate and the furniture of nineteen palaces ought to have amounted to a far greater sum than an hundred and eighteen thousand pounds  R Symonds says the committee of Somersethouse prized the King's goods and moveables with the pictures at  l  notwithstanding the Queen had carried away and himself caused to be conveyed away abundance of jewels and for this he cites Beauchamp clerk to the committee  The sale continued to August The prices were fixed but if more was offered the highest bidder purchased this happened in some instances not in many Part of the goods were sold by inch of candle The buyers called contractors signed a writing for the several sums If they disliked the bargain they were at liberty to be discharged from the agreement on paying one fourth of the sum stipulated Among the purchasers of statues and pictures were

farther sale but even detained from the purchasers much of what they had contracted for This appears by a  Copied by Vertue from a paper in possession of Mr Martin  petition addressed after the protector's death to the council of state by major Edward Bass Emanuel de Critz William Latham and Henry Willet in behalf of themselves and divers others in which they represent  "That in the year the petitioners did buy of the contractors for the sale of the late King's goods the several parcels there undernamed and did accordingly make satisfaction unto the Treasurer for the same But for as much as the said goods are in Whitehall and some part thereof in Mr Kinnersley's custody in keeping the petitioners do humbly desire their honour's order whereby they may receive the said goods they having been great sufferers by the late General Cromwell's detaining thereof and the petitioners c"  The goods specified are hangings and statues in the garden at Whitehall It is very remarkable that in this piece they style the Protector the late  General  Cromwell  Whence Charles had his statues we learn from Peacham "The King also says he ever since his coming to the crown hath amply testified a royal liking of ancient statues by causing a whole army of old foreign Emperors Captains and Senators all at once to land on his coasts to come and do him homage and attend him in palaces of  St James's and Somersethouse A great part of these belonged to the late Duke of Mantua and some of the old Greek marble bases columns and altars were brought from the ruins of Apollo's temple at Delos by that noble and absolutely compleat gentleman Sir Kenelm Digby Knight"  Compleat Gentleman  Some of the most capital pictures were purchased by the King of Spain which arriving there while the Embassadors of Charles II were at that court they were desired by an odd kind of delicacy to withdraw they supposing that this dismission was owing to an account received at the same time of Cromwell's victory over the Marquis of Argyle "but says Lord Clarendon  In his life p fol edit  they knew afterwards that the true cause of this impatience to get rid of them was that their minister in England having purchased many of the King's pictures and rich furniture had sent them to the Groyne from whence they were expected to arrive about that time at Madrid which they thought could not decently be brought to the palace while the ambassadors remained at the court"  After the restoration endeavours were used to reassemble the spoils A commission was issued out to examine Hugh Peters concerning the disposal of the pictures jewels c that had belonged to the royal family but without effect by the obstinacy or ignorance of Peters who would not or could not give the desired satisfaction  See General Dict vol ii p  Some of the pictures had been purchased by Gerard Reyntz  They are engraved in Reyntz's gallery  a Dutch collector after whose death they were bought of his widow by the states and presented  to Charles II One only picture the King on horseback by Vandyck was recovered by a process at law from Remèe or Remigius Van Leemput a painter then in England who had bought it at the sale  Notwithstanding the havoc that had been made it is plain from the catalogue of the collection of James II that the crown still possessed a great number of valuable pictures but the fire of Whitehall destroyed almost all that the rage of civil war had spared Some valuable pieces indeed were carried to Lisbon from Somersethouse by the Queen Dowager when she returned to Portugal The then Lord Chamberlain it is said put a stop to their embarkation 'till mollified by the present of one of them that he admired  The royal library escaped better This was founded by James I It contained the collection belonging to the crown among which were several fine editions on vellom sent as presents from abroad on the restoration of learning to Henry VII Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth the library of the Lord Lumley purchased by James for Prince Henry the collection of Casaubon bought of his widow and some curious MSS brought from Constantinople by Sir Thomas Roe These books have been given to the British Museum by his late majesty To this library Prince Henry had added a large number of coins medals cameos and intaglias the Dactyliotheca of Gorlaeus Mr Young librarian to Charles I  In this library says Perinchief was kept a collection of his of the excellent sayings of authors written by his own hand and in his youth presented to his father King James Life of Charles p  was removed by the council of state in at which time an account of the books and coins was taken of the latter there were of which only remained at the restoration Among the Duke of Ormond's letters is one dated April  where he says "All the rarities in the King's library at St James's are vanished" Yet it is evident many remained for in June a Vote passed "that the Lord Whitlocke be desired and authorized to take upon him the care and custody of the library at Jameshouse and of all the books manuscripts and medals that are in or belonging to the said library that the same be safely kept and preserved and to recover all such as have been embezzled or taken out of the same" Charles II after his return ordered Ashmole  Memoires of El Ashmole prefixed to his Berkshire p  to draw up an account of the medals that were left and placed them in the closet of Henry VIII at Whitehall where they were lost at the fire  What farther relates to Charles I as protector of the arts will be found in the subsequent pages under the articles of the different professors whom he countenanced If this chapter has not been thought tedious and too circumstantial the readers who excuse it will not perhaps be sorry if I add a little more to it on that other patron of genius the Earl of Arundel  There is a short view of his life in Sir Edward Walker's historical discourses and some curious particulars in Lilly's observations on the life and death of King Charles As the book is not in every body's hands one anecdote may be worth transcribing The King taking the part of a priest who pretended that his majesty had a right to a rectory which the Earl challenged as his Arundel said to Charles "Sir this rectory was an appendent to a manour of mine untill my grandfather unfortunately lost both his life and seventeen lordships more for the love he bore to your grandmother" P  Thomas Howard Earl of Arundel is sufficiently known in his public character by that admirable portrait drawn of him by Lord Clarendon Living much within himself but in all the state of the ancient  nobility his chief amusement was his collection the very ruins of which are ornaments now to several principal cabinets He was the first who professedly began to collect in this country and led the way to Prince Henry King Charles and the Duke of Buckingham "I cannot says Peacham  Compleat Gentleman p  but with much reverence mention the every way Right Honorable Thomas Howard Lord High Marshal of England as great for his noble patronage of arts and ancient learning as for his high birth and place to whose  In one of R Symondes's pocketbooks in the museum is a character not quite so favourable of the Earl "Mai says he rimunerò persona Era molto generoso e libero a forastieri per guadagnare fama ed in quella cosa spendea liberamente" There are also the following hints "Old Earle fece rubare pezzo di quel quadro di Veronese a Padova but it was spoiled says Mr Jer Lanier Last Earl Thomas molto lodato di Jer Lanier per uom honestissimo et civile ed intendentissimo per patto furono d'accordo d'andare in Italia quest' anno per comprare disegni e quadri" This Thomas must be the person who was restored to the title of Duke of Norfolk by Charles II and died at Padua in  liberal charges and magnificence this angle of the world oweth the first sight of Greek and Roman statues with whose admired presence he began to honour the gardens and galleries of Arundelhouse about twenty  This was printed in  years ago and hath ever since continued to transplant old Greece into England" The person chiefly employed by the Earl in these researches was Mr Petty It appears from Sir Thomas Roe's letters who had a commission of the like nature from the Duke of Buckingham  "Neither am I says the Duke so fond of antiquity as you rightly conjecture to court it in a deformed or mishapen stone" Page  that no man was ever better qualified for such an employment than Mr Petty "He encounters  says Sir Thomas  Page See the particulars of several purchases made by Sir Thomas and Mr Petty in various letters in that collection They are worth reading  all accidents with unwearied patience eats with Greeks on their workdays lies with fishermen on planks is all things that may obtain his ends" Mr Petty returning with his collection from Samos narrowly escaped with his life in a great storm but lost all his curiosities and was imprisoned for a spy but obtaining his liberty pursued his searches  Many curious pieces of painting and antiquities especially medals the Earl bought of Henry Vanderborcht a painter of Brussels who lived at Frankendal and whose son Henry Lord Arundel finding at Frankfort sent to Mr Petty then collecting for him in Italy and afterwards kept in his service as long as he lived Vanderborcht the younger was both painter and graver he drew many of the Arundelian curiosities and etched several things both in that and the royal collection A book of his drawings from the former containing pieces is preserved at Paris and is described in the catalogue of L'orangerie p After the death of the Earl the younger Henry entered into the service of the Prince of Wales afterwards Charles II and lived in esteem in London for a considerable time but returned to Antwerp and died there  See English School p There is a print by Hollar of Elias Allen from a painting of Vanderborcht  There are prints by Hollar of both father and son the former done from a painting of the latter  The Earl was not a meer selfish virtuoso he was bountifull to men of talents retaining

views of Albury the Earl's seat in Surrey "Lord Arundel thought  Sculptura p  says Evelyn that one who could not design a little would never make an honest man" A foolish observation enough and which if he had not left better proofs would give one as little opinion of the judgment of the speaker as it does of that of the relator The Earl seems to have had in his service another painter one Harrison now only known to us by a chronologic diary in which he records particulars relating to old Parr whom Lord Arundel had a curiosity to see  See Peck's collection of divers curious historic pieces subjoined to his lives of Cromwell and Milton The Earl sent Parr who was then blind to King Charles The King said to him "You have lived longer other men what have you done more than other men" He replied "I did penance when I was an hundred years old"  At the beginning of the troubles the Earl transported himself and  his collection to Antwerp and dying not long after at Padua he divided his personal estate between his sons Henry Lord Maltravers and Sir William Howard Viscount Stafford Of what came to the eldest branch since Dukes of Norfolk the most valuable part fell into the hands of the Duchess who was divorced the statues she sold  The Dutchess it is said wanted money and sold them for  l  to the last Earl of Pomfret's father which have been lately given by the Countess

The most common books expatiate on a painter whose works are so numerous and so well known His pictures were equally adapted to please the ignorant and the conoisseurs Familiar subjects familiar histories treated with great lustre and fullness of colouring a richness of nature and propriety of draperies recommend themselves at first sight to the eyes of the vulgar The just boldness of his drawing the wonderfull chiaro scuro diffused throughout his pictures and not loaded like Rembrandt's to force out one peculiar spot of light the variety of his carnations the fidelity to the customs and manners of the times he was representing and attention to every part of his compositions without enforcing trifles too much or too much neglecting them all this union of happy excellencies endear the works of Rubens to the best judges he is perhaps the single artist who attracts the suffrages of every rank One may justly call him the  S  R  PETER PAUL RUBENS  T Chambars sculp  popular painter  he wanted that majesty and grace which confine the works of the greatest masters to the fewest admirers I shall be but brief on the circumstances of his life he staid but little here in which light only he belongs to this treatise  This extract is chiefly made from Felibien vol iii p from Descamps p and Sandrart  His father was doctor of laws and senator of Antwerp which he quitted on the troubles of that country and retired with his family to Cologn where on the feast of St Peter and Paul his wife was delivered of Rubens in Great care was taken of his education he learned and spoke Latin in perfection When Antwerp was reduced by the arms of Philip Rubens the father returned to his native country The son was grown up and was well made The Countess of Lalain took him for her page but he had too elevated a disposition to throw away his talents on so dissipated a way of life He quitted that service and his father being dead his mother consented to let him pursue his passion for painting Toby Verhaest a landscapepainter and Adam Van Oort were his first masters and then Otho Venius under whom he imbibed one of his least merits a taste for allegory The perplexed and silly emblems of Venius are well known Rubens with nobler simplicity is perhaps less just in his One may call some of his pictures  a toleration of all religions  In one of the compartments of the Luxemburgh gallery a cardinal introduces Mercury to Mary de' Medici and Hymen supports her train at the sacrament of marriage before an altar on which are the images of God the Father and Christ  See more on this subject at the end of Mr Spence's Polymetis  At the age of twentythree Rubens set out for Italy and entered into the service of Vincent Gonzaga Duke of Mantua One day while he was at  that court and was painting the story of Turnus and Aeneas intending to warm his imagination by the rapture of poetry he repeated with energy those lines of Virgil  No wonder his emulation was raised at Mantua where the works of Homer were treated by Raphael and Julio Romano  Ille etiam patriis agmen ciet c  The Duke who over heard him and entered the chamber was surprized to find the mind of his painter cultivated with a variety of gracefull litterature Rubens was named Envoy to Spain and carried magnificent presents to the favorite Duke of Lerma exerting at that court his political and elegant talents with a dignity and propriety that raised the latter without debasing the former He conversed little with the painters of that country except Velasquez with whom he continued a correspondence of letters  The fame of the young painter reached Don John of Braganza afterwards King of Portugal who invited him to Villa Viciosa Rubens set out with such a train that the Duke apprehended the expence of entertaining so pompous a visitor and wrote to stop his journey accompanying the excuse with a present of fifty pistoles The painter refused the present said he had not proposed to paint but to pass a week at Villa Viciosa and had brought a thousand pistoles that he intended to spend there  Returned to Mantua the Duke sent him to Rome to copy the works of the great masters There he studied them not what they had studied the ancients Rubens was too careless of the antique as Poussin copied it too servilely The former seemed never to have seen a statue the latter nothing else The reputation of Titian and Paul  Veronese drew Rubens to Venice there he was in his element in the empire of colours There he learned to imitate nature at Rome he had missed the art of improving on it If he has not the simplicity of Titian he has far more than Paul Veronese The buildings with which he has enriched the back grounds of his compositions do not yield to those of the latter his landscapes are at least equal to those of the former Seldom as he practiced it Rubens was never greater than in landscape the tumble of his rocks and trees the deep shadows in his glades and glooms the watery sunshine and dewy verdure show a variety of genius which are not to be found in the inimitable but uniform glow of Claud Lorrain  Rubens was much worse employed at Genoa where he drew most of their palaces and caused them to be engraved in two volumes How could a genius like his overlook the ruins of Rome the designs of Raphael and Michael Angelo and the restorers of ancient architecture at Venice and waste his time on the very moderate beauties that he found at Genoa where their greatest art lay in crowding magnificence into a narrow and almost useless situation where most of their palaces can only be seen from a sedan chair  His mother's illness drew him back to Antwerp where the Archduke Albert detained him and where he married his first wife Elizabeth Brants He built a palace and painted it within and without His cabinet or rotunda was enriched with antique vases statues medals and pictures The Duke of Buckingham saw and coveted it Le Blond whom I have mentioned in the life of Holbein negotiated the bargain to which Rubens consented with regret The favorite who was bent on the purchase gave it is said ten thousand pounds for what had not cost above a thousand  In Flanders he executed many great works which created him as many enemies They affected to ascribe to the scholars whom he had formed or been forced to take to assist him as Jordaens Van Uden Snyder and Wildens the merits of the masterbut the greater the talents of the assistants the higher the genius of the master Do able painters work under an indifferent one Abraham Janssens challenged Rubens to a trial of their art Rubens replied he would engage with him when Janssens had proved himself worthy to be his competitor A more friendly offer was rejected by him with equal wit A chymist tendered him a share of his laboratory and of his hopes of the philosopher's stone Rubens carried the visionary into his painting room and told him his offer was dated twenty years too late "for so long it is said he since I found the art of making gold with my pallet and pencils"  From Antwerp he was called to Paris by Mary de' Medici and painted the ostensible history of her life in the Luxemburgh  It is said that she designed he should fill another gallery with the story of Henry IV her husband and that he had begun several of the compartments but the troubles of that Princess prevented the execution Abregè de la vie des peintres Vol ii p  A peculiar honour as that Princess was an Italian It is even said that he gave her some lessons in drawing If the prodigious number of large pieces painted by Rubens were not testimonies of the abundance and facility of his genius this gallery alone compleated in three years would demonstrate it As soon as it was finished he returned to Antwerp where his various talents were so conspicuous that he was pitched upon to negotiate a treaty of peace between Spain and England The Infanta Isabella sent him to Madrid for instructions where he ingratiated  himself so much with the CondeDue D'olivarez that besides many valuable presents he had a brevet for himself and his son of secretary of the Privycouncil and was dismissed with a secret commission to King Charles as I have mentioned before in which he had the honour of succeeding  Neither Charles nor Rubens overlooked in the Embassador the talents of the Painter The King engaged him to paint the cieling of the Banquettinghouse The design is the apotheosis of King James for whom when once deified there seems to have been no farther thought of erecting a monument The original sketch for the middle compartment is preserved at Houghton It had belonged to Sir Godfrey Kneller who often studied it as is evident by Sir Godfrey's original sketch at Houghton too for the great equestrian picture of King William at Hamptoncourt though in the larger piece he seems to have forgot that he ever had studied the former design Sir Godfrey had heard that Jordaens assisted Rubens in the execution if true some of the compartments must have been painted in Holland and sent over hither for I do not find that Jordaens was ever in England Rubens received three thousand pounds for his work The building itself cost seventeen thousand pounds What had it been if compleated Vandyck was to have painted the sides with the history of the order of the garter Inigo Jones Rubens and Vandyck Europe could not have shown a nobler chamber Kent in the late reign repaired the painting on the cieling  During his residence here Rubens painted for the King a St George  In a letter in the Museum dated March it is said "My Lord Carlisle hath twice in one week most magnificently feasted the Spanish Embassador and Mons Rubens also the agent who prepared the way for his coming who in honour of our nation hath drawn with his pencil the history of St George wherein if it be possible he hath exceeded himself but the picture he hath sent home into Flanders to remain as a monument of his abode and employment here" This I suppose was a repetition of the picture he drew for the King One of them is now in the collection of the Earl of Lincoln  four feet high and seven feet wide His majesty was represented  in the Saint the Queen in Cleodelinde each figure one foot and half high at a distance a view of Richmond and the Thames In another picture the benefits of peace and miseries of war  See King Charles's catalogue p  Theodore Rogiers  There is a head of Rogiers among the artists drawn by Vandyck  modelled for the King a silver ewer designed by Rubens with the

See their catalogues by Bathoe  The  Duchess of Marlborough gave any price for his pictures They  There are sixteen pieces by this master the best are his own portrait with his wife and child the offering of the Magi and the Roman charity  are the first ornaments of Blenheim but have suffered by neglect At Wilton are two one the Assumption of the Virgin painted for the Earl of Arundel while Rubens was in England and with which he was so pleased himself that he afterwards made a large picture from it for a convent at Antwerp The other contains four children Christ an Angel St John and a girl representing the church This picture which is far superior to the foregoing and very fine is said in the catalogue to be allowed to be the best picture in England of Rubens an hyperbole indeed  See Kennedy's account of Wilton p  At the Earl of Pomfret's at Easton was a portrait of Lodowic Duke of Richmond and Lenox At Houghton is that masterly piece Mary Magdalen anointing the feet of Christ and a large cartoon of Meleager and Atalanta There too are three pieces in three different styles in each of which he excelled a landscape and satyrs and lions Animals especially of the savage kind he painted beyond any master that ever lived In his satyrs though highly coloured and with characteristic countenances he wanted poetic imagination They do not seem a seperate species but a compound of the human and animal in which each part is kept too distinct His female satyrs are scarce more indelicate than his women one would think that like Swift he did not intend that Yahoos should be too discriminate from human nature though what the satyrist drew from spleen flowed in the painter from an honest love of flesh and blood There are besides in Lord Orford's collection the sketches for the Cardinal Infant's entry into Antwerp the family of Rubens by his scholar  Jordaens and his second wife Helena Forman a celebrated whole length by Vandyck  The fine picture of St Martin the late Prince of Wales bought of Mr Bagnol who brought it from Spain It is remarkable that in this piece Rubens has borrowed the head of an old man from the cripple in one of the cartoons of which I have said he gave information to King Charles who purchased them At Lord Spencer's at Wimbleton is a fine portrait of Cardinal Howard At Burleigh is an Ebony Cabinet the front and Sides of which are painted by Rubens at one End are his three Wives highly coloured  I do not find how long Rubens stayed in England probably not above a year He died of the gout in his own country in A catalogue of his works may be seen in Descamps  See also a list of the works of Rubens in Le Comte's cabinet des singularitez d' architecture peinture c vol i p There are forty six pieces painted by him in the Elector

years ago a MS containing discourses and observations on human bodies and on the statues and paintings of the ancients and moderns written partly in Latin partly in Italian and some notes in Dutch and illustrated with several drawings as heads attitudes proportions c habits of Greeks and Romans various instruments utensils armour and headdresses from coins and statues and comparisons of Raphael Michael Angelo and others It was an octavo pocketbook and appeared to be an exact copy of Rubens's Album which he used in his travels the drawings and even handwriting and different inks being exactly imitated  This book was brought from Brussels by Capt Johnson Mr Johnson's son and had one leaf of the original in it with a sketch of the head of the Farnesian Hercules The original itself is at Paris where they intended to publish it An account of it is given in the catalogue raisonnè de monsieur Quintin de L'orangerie par Frederic Gersaint  ABRAHAM DIEPENBECK  among the various scholars of Rubens was one of the few that came to England where he was much employed by William Cavendish Duke of Newcastle whose managed horses he drew from the life from whence were engraved the cuts that adorn that Peer's book of horsemanship Several of the original pictures still remain in the hall at Welbeck Diepenbeck drew views of the Duke's seats in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire and portraits of the Duke Duchess and his children and gave designs for several plates prefixed to the works of both their Graces "Diepenbeck says De Piles was born at Boisleduc and in his youth was much employed in painting upon glass  Sandrart says he excelled all the other painters on glass  and entering afterwards into the school of Rubens became one of his best disciples" Several prints were made from his works particularly those he designed for a book called The Temple of the Muses engraved by Bloemart and Mattham in  Sandrart See a farther account of Diepenbeck in the Abregè de la vie des plus fameux peintres vol ii p At Cashiobury is the story of Dido and Aeneas by him Sir R Walpole had another but smaller  and his portraits of Lessius and Bellarmine by Bolsvert  V Evelyn's Sculptura p  and of Sir Hugh Cartwright by Vosterman  Sir ANTONY VANDYCK  whose works are so frequent in England that the generality of our people can scarce avoid thinking him their countryman was born at Antwerp in the only son of a merchant and of a mother who was admired for painting flowers in small and for her needleworks in silk Vandyck was first placed with Van Balen who had studied at Rome and painted figures both in large and small but the fame of Rubens drew away to a nobler school the young congenial artist The progress of the disciple speedily raised him to the glory of assisting in the works from which he learned Fame that always supposes jealousy is felt where there are grounds for it attributes to Rubens an envy of which his liberal nature I believe was incapable and makes him advise Vandyck to apply himself chiefly to portraits I shall show that jealousy at least emulation is rather to be ascribed to the scholar than to the master If Rubens gave the advice in question he gave it with reason not maliciously Vandyck had a peculiar genius for portraits his draperies  His sattins of which he was fond particularly white and blue are remarkably finished his backgrounds heavy and have great sameness  are finished with a minuteness of truth not demanded in historic compositions besides his invention was cold and tame nor does he any where seem to have had much idea of the passions and their expression Portraits require none If Rubens had been jealous of Vandyck would he as all their biographers agree he did persuade him to visit Italy whence himself had drawn his greatest lights Addison did not advise Pope to translate Homer but assisted Tickell in a rival translation Vandyck after making presents to Rubens of two or  ANTONY VANDYCK  pinx  Bannerman Sculp  From an original in the Collection of the  three histories and the famous portrait of the latter's wife set out for Italy and made his first residence at Genoa From thence he went to Venice which one may call the metropolis of the Flemish painters who seem so naturally addicted to colouring that even in Italy they see only with Flemish eyes Vandyck imbibed so deeply the tints of Titian that he is allowed to approach nearer to the carnations of that master even than Rubens Sir Anthony had more delicacy than the latter but like him never reached the grace and dignity of the antique He seldom even arrived at beauty His Madonnas are homely his ladies so little flattered that one is surprized he had so much custom He has left us to wonder that the famous Countess of Carlisle could be thought so charming and had not Waller been a better painter Sacharissa would make little impression now One excellence he had which no portraitpainter ever attained except Sir Godfrey Kneller the hands are often the finest part of his pictures  He went to Rome and lived splendidly avoiding the low conversation of his countrymen and distinguished by the appellation of the  Pittore Cavalieresco  It was at Rome he drew that capital portrait of Cardinal Bentivoglio who having been Nuncio in Flanders had a partiality for their artists and as he celebrated their history with his pen was in return almost immortalized by one of their best pencils  Vandyck while at Rome received an invitation to Palermo and went thither There he painted Prince Philibert of Savoy the ViceRoy and a paintress of some name  At the Lord Spenser's at Wimbledon is a good portrait of Sophonisba Anguisciola playing on a harpsichord painted by herself and an old woman attending her on the picture is written Jussu Patris Lord Ashburnham has a small head of her in a round  Sophonisba Anguisciola then at the age of ninetyone But the plague soon drove him from Sicily  he returned to Genoa where he had gained the highest reputation and where he has left many considerable works  He went back to Antwerp and practiced both history and portrait Of the former kind were many applauded Altarpieces in the latter were particularly the heads of his cotemporary artists He drew them in Chiaro scuro on small pannels thirtyfive of which are in the collection of the Countess of Cardigan at Whitehall Admirable is the variety of attitudes and airs of heads but in those pieces he meaned to surpass as well as record The whole collection has been thrice published the first edition by Vanden Enden contains fourscore plates the second by Giles Hendrix one hundred the last by Verdussen who effaced the names and letters of the original engravers Some of the plates were etched by Vandyck himself I say nothing of the numbers of prints from his other works  Hearing of the favour King Charles showed to the arts Vandyck came to England and lodged with his friend Geldorp a painter hoping to be introduced to the King it is extraordinary he was not He went away chagrined but his majesty soon learning what a treasure had been within his reach ordered Sir Kenelm Digby who had sat to Vandyck to invite him over He came and was lodged among the King's artists at Blackfryars which Felibien according to the dignity of ignorance which the French affect calls  L'Hotel de Blaifore  Vol iii page  Thither the King went often by water and viewed his performances with singular delight frequently sitting to him himself and bespeaking pictures of the Queen his children and his courtiers and conferring the  honour of knighthood  The French author of the lives of the painters says he was created Knight of the Bath a mistake Abregè vol ii p Another mistake is his supposing that Vandyck was only to give designs for tapestries in the Banquettinghouse p  on him at St James's July This was soon attended by the grant of an annuity of  l  a year for life The patent is preserved in the rolls and dated in which he is styled painter to his majesty I have already mentioned the jealousy of Mytens on this occasion  Of the various portraits by Vandyck of King Charles the principal are a whole length in the coronation robes at Hamptoncourt  In the same palace are whole lengths of James I his Queen the Queen of Bohemia and Prince Henry copied by Vandyck from painters of the preceding reign Prince Henry's is in armour in which Vandyck excelled has an amiable countenance and is a fine picture  the head has been engraved by Vertue among the Kings of England Another in armour on a dun horse at Blenheim  This was in the royal collection was sold in the civil war and was bought by the Duke of Marlborough from Munich  A whole length in armour at Houghton Another a large piece at the Duke of Grafton's in which the King a most gracefull figure in white sattin with his hat on is just descended from his horse at a distance a view of the Isle of Wight The  This is the picture that was recovered from Remèe  King in armour on a white horse Mons de St Antoine  He had been a chief equerry to Prince Henry and led a mourning horse at his funeral See Birch's life of that Prince append  his equerry holding his helmet The head of the latter is fine the King's is probably not an original This and the following are at each end of the gallery at Kensington The King and Queen sitting Prince Charles  very young standing at his knee the Duke of York an infant on hers  This picture has been heightened to make it match it's opposite  At Turin is another whole length of the King in a large piece of architecture At Somersethouse the King and Queen half lengths holding a crown of laurel between them At Windsor is a beautifull half length of the Queen in white Many portraits of her pretend to be by Vandyck but none are so lovely as this He two or three times drew Prince Charles in armour standing At Kensington in one piece are Prince Charles Prince James and the Princess Mary lately engraved by Strange In the same palace is one of his finest works George Villiers the second Duke of Buckingham and Lord Francis his brother when children Nothing can exceed the nature lustre and delicacy of this sweet picture At Houghton are two young daughters of the Lord Wharton admirable too but rather inferior to the foregoing In Lord Orford's collection are several principal works  See a particular description of these pictures in the Aedes Walpolianae  of this master The holy family with a dance of Angels it belonged to King Charles is a capital picture but has it's faults Inigo Jones a head Rubens's wife in black sattin Henry Danvers Earl of Danby whole length in the robes of the garter and a half length of Sir Thomas Chaloner governor of Prince Henry Besides these my father bought of the last Duke the whole collection of the Wharton family There were twelve whole lengths the two girls six half lengths and two more by Sir Peter Lely he paid an hundred pounds each for the whole lengths and the double picture and fifty pounds each for the half lengths Most of them were carried to Houghton but some not suiting the places were brought back and sold for a trifle after the death of my father Those that remain are King Charles the  Queen very indifferent Sir Thomas Wharton Of the half lengths Laud a celebrated but not very fine picture Sir Christopher Wandesford Lady Wharton Mrs Wharton Mrs Wenman and the Lely's  The rest were Lord Wharton bought by Lord Royston Lady Wharton in white Lady Chesterfield ditto Countess of Worcester in blue Lady Rich in black very handsome on whose death Waller wrote a poem Mrs Smith in blue a homely woman but a fine picture now mine Lady Carlisle bought by Mr West Arthur Goodwin father of Mrs Smith one of the best given by my father to the late Duke of Devonshire and two portraits of Prince Rupert whole and half lengths both very poor performances Some of the whole lengths were engraved by Van Gunst  At Cornbury the seat of the Earls of Clarendon in Oxfordshire was a noble collection of portraits of the principal persons in the reign of King Charles many of which were drawn by Vandyck The collection has since been divided between the Duchess of Queensberry Lady Hyde and Lady Mary Forbes the heiresses of the family Several others of his works are at the Earl of Denbigh's and at Lord Spenser's at Althrop Among the latter a celebrated double whole length of the first Duke of Bedford and the famous Lord Digby afterwards Earl of Bristol The whole figure of the latter is good and both the heads fine the body of Bedford is flat nor is this one of his capital works Here too is a good picture of Daedalus and Icarus half lengths a fine surly impatience in the young man and his body well coloured The Duke of Devonshire has some good pictures by him at Chiswick is the well known  Lord Burlington gave  l  for this picture at Paris and had another of Luca Jordano into the bargain  Belisarius though very doubtfull if by the hand of Vandyck The expressive figure of the young soldier redeems this picture from the condemnation it would deserve by the principal  figure being so mean and inconsiderable The Duke has Vandyck's travelling pocketbook in which are several sketches particularly from Titian and of Sophonisba Anguisciola mentioned above  At Holkham is a large equestrian picture of a Count D'Aremberg both the rider and horse are in his best manner and at Earl Cowper's a large piece of John Count of Nassau and his family lately engraved by Baron  Mr Skinner with the collection of the late Mr Thomas Walker has a fine little picture of the Lady Venetia Digby wife of Sir Kenelm though only a model for the large one at Windsor it is exquisitely finished She is represented as treading on Envy and Malice and is unhurt by a serpent that twines round her arm This galant compliment is a little explained in the new life of Lord Clarendon who mentions Sir Kenelm's marriage with a Lady "though of an extraordinary beauty of as extraordinary fame"  There is an elegy and epitaph on this Lady in Randolph's poems page in which her beauty is exceedingly commended She was daughter and coheiress of Sir Edward Stanley grandson of Edward Earl of Derby by the Lady Lucy Percy daughter of Thomas Earl of Northumberland Lady Venetia was found dead in her bed Sir Kenelm erected for her a monument of black marble with her bust in copper gilt and a lofty epitaph in Christchurch without Newgate but it was destroyed in the fire of London Lodge's peerage of Ireland vol iv p There are two copper busts of the Lady Venetia extant at Mr Wright's at Gothurst in Buckinghamshire with several portraits of the family of Digby The house belonged to Sir Kenelm and was purchased by Sir Nathan Wright  Mr Walker's collection was chiefly chosen for him by a set of virtuosi called Vandyck's or the club of St Luke and it is plain from the pictures they recommended that they understood what they professed There was another large piece of Sir Kenelm his lady and two children in the collection of the Earl  of Oxford and a fine half length of Sir Kenelm alone is at Kensington Vandyck painted too for the King a twelfth Roman Emperor to compleat the set of Titian in the room of one which was spoiled and left at Mantua They cost the King  l  a piece and after his death were bought by the Spanish Embassador the first purchaser of those effects As the King's collection was embezzled or taken by his servants for their arrears that minister laid out  l  in those purchases with Harrison possibly the person mentioned p the King's embroiderer by Somersethouse and of Murray his taylor he bought a half figure of a Venus  These and many other notices are taken from the Pocketbooks of Richard Symonds of BlackNotley in Essex gent who was born at Okehampton and was in the army of King Charles during the civil war writing memoires of battles actions motions and promotions of officers from time to time in small pocketbooks and through the several counties he passed memorandums of churches monuments painted windows arms inscriptions c 'till January when he left London and travelled first to Paris and then to Rome and Venice always continuing his memoires where he stayed 'till his return to England in Eight or ten of these books were in the Harleian library two in that of Dr Meade and two or three in the herald's office where is the pedigree of his family with his picture probably in red wax from a seal engraved by T Simon his namesake but no relation  The Flemings gave any price for the works of Vandyck from that collection Sir Peter Lely as may be seen in his catalogue had several capital ones  But it is at the Earl of Pembroke's at Wilton that Vandyck is on his throne The great Salon is entirely furnished by his hand There is that principal picture of Earl Philip and his family which though damaged would serve alone as a school of this master Yet with great admiration of him I cannot but observe how short he falls of his model  Titian What heads both of age and youth are in the family of Cornaro at Northumberlandhouse How happily is the disposition of a religious act chosen to throw expression into a groupe of portraits It is said that the Earl of Pembroke had obtained leave to have a piece of the whole royal family by the same hand as a companion to his own  At Leicesterhouse is a double portrait bought by the late Prince of Wales of Mr Bagnols It represents two of the wits of that time T Carew of the privychamber to Charles I and a poet and Henry Killigrew They had a remarkable dispute before Mrs Cecilia Crofts sister of the Lord Crofts to which Vertue supposed this picture alluded as in a play called the Wanderer was a song against jealousy written on the same occasion  I have reserved to the last  I have here as in the case of Holbein mentioned only the capital pieces or those which being in great collections are most easy of access I do not pretend to enumerate all that are or are called of this master  the mention of the finest picture in my opinion of this master It is of the Earl of Strafford and his secretary at the Marquis of Rockingham's at Wentworthhouse in Yorkshire I can forgive him any insipid portraits of perhaps insipid people when he showed himself capable of conceiving and transmitting the idea of the greatest man of the age There is another of these pictures at Blenheim but infinitely inferior  In the cathedral of Glocester are two cumbent figures of an alderman and his wife evidently wrought from a design of Vandyck It is great pity the sculptor is not known so successfully has he executed the manner of the painter The figures even in that tasteless attitude  are easy and gracefull and the draperies have a peculiar freedom  Sanderson a quaint writer uses a phrase which though affected is expressive He says "Vandyck was the first painter who e're put ladies dress into a careless romance" Graphice p  Vandyck had  l  for a half and  l  for a whole length a more rational proportion than that of our present painters who receive an equal price for the most insignificant part of the picture  He was indefatigable  This is evident by the number of his works for though he was not above fortytwo when he died they are not exceeded by those of Rubens  and keeping a great table often detained the persons who sat to him to dinner for an opportunity of studying their countenances and of retouching their pictures again in the afternoon Sir Peter Lely told Mrs Beale that Laniere assured him he had sat seven entire days to him morning and evening and that notwithstanding Vandyck would not once let him look at the picture 'till he was content with it himself This was the portrait that determined the King to invite him to England a second time  It is at the seat of the Lord Chancellor Henley at the Grange in Hampshire  In the summer he lived at Eltham in Kent in an old house there said to have been his Vertue saw several sketches of stories from Ovid in two colours ascribed to him  At the Duke of Grafton's is a fine half length of  I have a fine sketch of the sace only by himself  Vandyck by himself when young holding up his arm the hand declined There is a print of it and of two others of him older one looking over his shoulder the other with a sunflower At Hamptoncourt in the apartment  below is his  From the minutes of the Antiquarian Society I find that in they were informed that at Mr Isaac Ewer's in Lincoln'sinnfields was a copy by Vanderbank of Thurloe's portrait painted by Mr Churchill's pupil mistress to Vandyck This person I suppose was Mrs Carlisle mentioned hereafter but of Churchill I have seen no other account  mistress Mrs Lemon highly finished There is a print of the same person by Hollar but not from this picture In the pocketbook of R Symonds that I have mentioned he says "It was much wondered at that he Vandyck should openly keep a mistress of his Mrs Lemon in the house and yet suffer Porter to keep her company" This was Endymion Porter of the bedchamber to King Charles of whom and his family there was a large piece by Vandyck at Buckinghamhouse  See a list of Vandyck's works in Le Comte's cabinet des singularitez d' architecture peinture c vol i p Many are in the gallery at Dusseldorp  He was much addicted to his pleasures and expence I have mentioned how well he lived He was fond of musick and generous to musicians His luxurious and sedentary life brought on the gout and hurt his fortune He sought to repair it not like his master by the laboratory of his painting room but by that real folly the pursuit of the Philosopher's stone in which perhaps he was encouraged by the example or advice of his friend Sir Kenelm Digby Towards the end of his life the King bestowed on him for a wife Mary the daughter of the unfortunate Lord Gowry which if meaned as a signal honour might be calculated too to depress the disgraced family by connecting them with the blood of a painter It is certain that the alliance does not seem to have attached Vandyck more strongly to the King whether he had any disgusts infused into him by his new wife or whether ambitious  as I have hinted of vying with the glory of his master in the Luxemburg Sir Antony soon after his marriage set out for Paris in hopes of being employed there in some public work He was disappointed  He was not totally unemployed there Sir Richard Lyttelton has two small pictures in chiaro scuro evidently designed for altarpieces and representing Anne of Austria and some monkish saint  their own Poussin was then deservedly the favorite at that court Vandyck returned to England and in the same humour of executing some public work and that in competition with his master He proposed to the King by Sir Kenelm Digby to paint the walls of the banquettinghouse of which the cieling was already adorned by Rubens with the history and procession of the order of the garter The proposal struck the King's taste and by a small sketch  Now at the Lord Chancellor Henley's at the Grange in Hampshire  in chiaro scuro for the procession in which though very faint some portraits are distinguishable it looks as if it had been accepted though some say it was rejected on the extravagant price demanded by Vandyck I would not specify the sum it is so improbable if I did not find it repeated in Fenton's notes on Waller It was fourscore thousand pounds The civil war prevented farther thoughts of it as the death of Vandyck would have interrupted the execution at least the completion of it He died in Blackfryars December and was buried on the th in St Paul's near the tomb of John of Gaunt  By Maria Ruthven his wife he left one daughter married to Mr Stepney a gentleman who rode in the horseguards on their first establishment by Charles II Their grandson Mr Stepney was Envoy to several courts and is known by his poems published in the collection of the works of our minor poets Sir John Stepney another descendent  died on the road from Bath to Wales in Lady Vandyck the widow was married again to Richard Pryse son of Sir John Pryse of NewtonAberbecham in Montgomeryshire Knight Richard who was created a Baronet August was first married to Hesther daughter of Sir Hugh Middleton by Vandyck's widow he had no issue  Vertue ascertained these matches by books in the college os arms  Besides his legitimate children Vandyck had a natural daughter called Maria Teresa to whom as appears by his will in Doctor's Commons he left four thousand pounds then in the hands of his sister Susannah Vandyck in a convent at Antwerp whom he appoints trustee for that daughter To his sister Isabella he bequeaths guilders yearly and in case his daughter Maria Teresa die unmarried he entails  l  on another sister married to Mr Derick and her children To his wife Mary and his newborn daughter Justiniana Anna he gives all his goods effects and monies due to him in England from King Charles the Nobility and all other persons whatever to be equally divided between them His executors are his wife Mr Aurelius de Meghan and Katherine Cowley to which Katherine he leaves the care of his daughter to be brought up allowing ten pounds per ann 'till she is eighteen years of age Other legacies he gives to his executors and trustees for their trouble and three pounds each to the poor of St Paul's and St Anne's Blackfriar's and to each of his servants male and female  The war prevented the punctual execution of his will the probate of which was not made 'till when the heirs and executors from abroad and at home assembled to settle the accounts and recover what  debts they couldbut with little effect In and in the heirs with Mr Carbonnel who had married the daughter of Vandyck's daughter made farther inspections into his affairs and demands on his creditors but what was the issue does not appear  Lady Lempster mother of the last Earl of Pomfret who was at Rome with her Lord wrote a life of Vandyck with some description of his works  Sir Kenelm Digby in his discourses compares Vandyck and Hoskins and says the latter pleased the most by painting in little  Waller has addressed a poem to Vandyck beginning  Rare artisan  Lord Halifax another on his portrait of Lady Sunderland printed in the third volume of State Poems and Cowley wrote an elegy on his death  Among the scholars  John de Reyn a scholar of Vandyck is said by Descamps to have lived with his master in England till the death of the latter after which he was in France and settled at Dunkirk If De Reyn's works are little known adds his Biographer it is owing to their approaching so nearly to his master's as to be confounded with them Vol ii p  of Vandyck

afterwards went to France Denmark and Sweden and died in  GEORGE GELDORP  of Antwerp a countryman and friend of Vandyck in whose house that painter lodged at his first arrival had been settled here some time before He could not draw himself but painted on sketches made by others and was in repute even by this artificial practice  This must not be supposed to include his portraits for which he certainly would have had no custom if the persons had been obliged to sit to two different men A painter may execute a head tho' he cannot compass a whole figure A print by Voerst of James Stewart Duke of Lenox with Geo Geldorp pinx is indubitable proof that the latter painted portraits  though Vertue was told by Mr Rose that it was not his most lucrative employment his house being reckoned convenient for the intrigues of people of fashion He first lived in Drurylane in a large house and garden rented from the crown at  l  per ann and afterwards in in Archerstreet He had been concerned in keeping the King's pictures and when Sir Peter Lely first came over he worked for Geldorp who lived 'till after the restoration and was buried at Westminster Another of the apprentices of Geldorp was  ISAAC SAILMAKER  who was employed by Cromwell to take a view of the fleet before Mardyke A print of the confederate fleet under Sir George Rooke  engaging the French commanded by the Count de

history by Polenburg and pieces of architecture in the manner of Steenwyck by this Van Bassen who must not be confounded with the Italian Bassans nor with the Bassanos who were musicians to Charles and of which name there was also a heraldpainter The first Bassano who came hither in  the reign of Queen Elizabeth and was related to the Italian painters of that name settled in Essex and purchased an estate which was sold in by the male descendent In the mansion was a portrait of the musician holding a bassviol It is now at Narford in Norfolk the seat of the late Sir Andrew Fountain  CORNELIUS POLENBURG  the sweet painter of little landscapes and figures was born at Utrecht in and educated under Bloemart whom he soon quitted to travel to Italy as he abandoned say our books the manner of Elsheimer to study Raphaelbut it is impossible to say where they find Raphael in Polenburg The latter formed a style entirely new and though preferable to the Flemish unlike any Italian except in having adorned his landscapes with ruins There is a varnished smoothness and finishing in his pictures that makes them always pleasing though simple and too nearly resembling one another The Roman Cardinals were charmed with the neatness of his works so was the great Duke but could not retain him He returned to Utrecht and pleased Rubens who had several of his performances King Charles invited him to London where he lived in Archerstreet next door to Geldorp and generally painted the figures in Steenwyck's perspectives There is a very curious picture at Earl Poulet's at Hinton St George representing an inside view of Theobald's with figures of the King Queen and the two Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery William and Philip This piece is probably of Steenwyck and the figures  In King Charles's catalogue are mentioned the portraits of his majesty and of the children of the King of Bohemia by Polenburg and in King James's are eight pieces by him  which are copied from Vandyck either of Polenburg or Van Bassen  CORNELIUS POLENBURG  Ipse pinx TChambars sculp  HENRY STEENWYCK  Ant Van Dyck pinx Bannerman Sculp  The works of Polenburg are very scarce  There are sixteen mentioned in the catalogue of James II  his scholar John de Lis of Breda imitated his manner so exactly that his pieces are often taken for the hand of his master The best picture in England of the latter is at the Viscount Midleton's I have his own and his wife's portrait by him in small ovals on copper they were my father's The wife is stiff and Dutch his own is inimitable Though worked up to the tender smoothness of enamel it has the greatest freedom of pencil the happiest delivery of nature  Charles could not prevail on Polenburg to fix here He returned to Utrecht and died there in at the age of seventyfour  HENRY STEENWYCK  was son  Descamps has proved that it is a mistake to call the son Nicholas as Sandrart and others have done See p  of the famous painter of architecture and learned that manner of his father I find no particulars of the time of his arrival here or when he died It is certain he worked for King Charles  In King James's catalogue are recorded ten of his works  The ground to the portrait of that Prince in the royal palace at Turin I believe was painted by him  In France are the portraits of Charles and his Queen by him about a soot high in one piece with a front of a royal palace in the back ground Descamps says this picture is more carefully laboured than any work of Vandyck and equal to the most valuable of Mieris p I believe the fine piece of architecture at Houghton is by the hand of Steenwyck the father By the son was a capital picture of St Peter in prison which at Streater's sale in sold for  l  It was afterwards in Dr Meade's collection who sold it to the late Prince of Wales  In a MS catalogue of King Charles's  collection is mentioned a perspective by Steenwyck with the King and Queen in little by Belcamp In the same catalogue is recorded a little book of perspectives by Steenwyck which on the sale of the King's goods sold for no more than two pounds ten Shillings Steenwyck's name and the date are on the picture of Frobenius at Kensington which he altered for King Charles It is the portrait of the son that is among the heads of painters by Vandyck His son Nicholas was in England also painted for King Charles and probably died here  JOHN TORRENTIUS  of Amsterdam is known to have been here not by his works but on the authority of Schrevelius in his history of Arlem from whom Descamps took his account Torrentius says the latter painted admirably in small but his subjects were not calculated to procure him many avowed admirers He painted from the lectures of Petronius and Aretine had the confidence to dogmatize on the same subjects and practiced at least what he preached To profligacy he added impiety 'till the magistrates thought proper to put a stop to his boldness He underwent the question and was condemned to an imprisonment of twenty years but obtained his liberty by the intercession of some men of quality and particularly of the English Embassadorwhat the name of the latter was we are not told Torrentius came over to England but giving more scandal than satisfaction he returned to Amsterdam and remained there concealed 'till his death in aged  fiftyone King Charles had two pieces of his hand one representing two glasses of Rhenish the other a naked man  V Catalogue P p  KEIRINCX  called here Carings was employed by King Charles to draw views his works are mentioned in the royal catalogue particularly prospects of his majesty's houses in Scotland In a sale of pictures in March was a landscape by him freely and brightly touched with his name written on it as above  The French author of the Abregè calls him Alexander which must be a mistake He says he acquired his reputation by what should have destroyed it as he could not paint figures Polenburg generally added them for him I have the view of a seat in a park by him freely painted not to say very carelessly It has King Charles's mark behind it  and a few small figures added by Polenburg In Dagar's sale were three drawings with a pen and washed by Keirincx one of them had a view of the parliamenthouse and Westminster stairs to the water dated  JOHN PRIWITZER  was too good a painter to remain so long unknown At Woburn besides some young heads of the family is a whole length of Sir William Russel a youth and Knight of the Bath in the robes of the order with a dwarf aged thirtytwo It is painted with great brightness and neatness and does not want freedom Upon it is written Johannes  Priwitzerus de Hungariâ faciebat I have never met with any other mention of this name  GEORGE JAMESONE  The materials of this article were communicated by Mr John Jamisone winemerchant in Leith who has another portrait of this painter by himself inches by  was the Vandyck of Scotland to which title he had a double pretension not only having surpassed his countrymen as a portraitpainter but from his works being sometimes attributed to Sir Antony who was his fellowscholar both having studied under Rubens at Antwerp  Jamesone was son of Andrew Jamesone an architect and was born at Aberdeen in At what age he went abroad or how long he continued there is not known After his return he applied with indefatigable industry to portrait in oil tho' he sometimes practiced in miniature and in history and landscape too His largest portraits  His earliest works are chiefly on board afterwards on a fine linen cloth smoothly primed with a proper tone to help the harmony of his shadows His best works were from to his death  were generally somewhat less than life His excellence is said to consist in delicacy and softness with a clear and beautifull colouring his shades not charged but helped by varnish with little appearance of the pencil There is a print of him his wife Isabella Tosh and a young son painted by himself in engraved by Alexander Jamesone his descendent in and now in the possession of Mr John Alexander limner at Edinburgh his great grandson with several other  GEORGE JAMESONE  Bannerman Sculp  portraits of the family painted by George particularly another of himself in his school with sketches both of history and landscape and with portraits of Charles st his Queen Jamesone's wife and four others of his works from the life  When King Charles visited Scotland in the magistrates of Edinburgh knowing his majesty's taste employed Jamesone to make drawings of the Scottish monarchs with which the King was so much pleased that inquiring for the painter he sat to him and rewarded him with a diamond ring from his own finger  It is observable that Jamesone always drew himself with his hat on either in imitation of his master Rubens or on having been indulged in that liberty by the King when he sat to him  Though most of the considerable families in Scotland are possessed of works by this master the greatest collection of them is at Taymouth the seat of the Earl of Breadalbane Sir Colin Campbell of Glenorchy his Lordship's ancestor having been the chief and earliest patron of Jamesone who had attended that gentleman on his travels From a MS on vellom containing the genealogy of the house of Glenorchy begun in are taken the following extracts written in page  "Item The said Sir Coline Campbell th Laird of Glenorchy gave unto George Jamesone painter in Edinburgh for King Robert and King David Bruysses Kings of Scotland and Charles the st King of Great Brittane France and Ireland and his Majesties Quein and for nine more of the Queins of Scotland their portraits quhilks are set up in the hall of Ballock now Taymouth the sum of tua hundreth thrie scor punds"  "Mair the said Sir Coline gave to the said George Jamesone for the Knight of Lockow's Lady and the first Countess of Argylle and six of the Ladys of Glenurquhay their portraits and the said Sir Coline his own portrait quhilks are set up in the chalmer of Deass of Ballock ane hundreth four scoire punds"  Memorandum In the same year the said George Jamesone painted a large genealogical tree of the family of Glenorchy feet long and broad containing in miniature the portraits of Sir Duncan Campbell of Lockow of Archibald Campbell his eldest son first Earl of Argylle and of Sir Coline Campbell his second son first Laird of Glenorchy together with the portraits of eight successive Knights Lairds of Glenorchy with the branches of their intermarriages and of those of their sons and daughters beautifully illuminated At the bottom of which tree the following words are painted on a scroll "The genealogie of the Hous of Glenurquhie whereof is descendit sundrie nobill and worthie houses  amesone faciebat"  Besides the foregoing Lord Breadalbane has at Taymouth by the same hand eleven portraits of Lords and Ladies of the first families in Scotland painted in and  From the extract above it appears that Jamesone received no more for each of those heads than twenty pounds Scots or one pound thirteen shillings and fourpence English Yet it is proved by their publick records that he died possessed of an easy fortune which he left to his three daughters two of whom were honorably married One of them named Mary distinguished herself by admirable needlework a piece of which used to be exhibited on festivals in the Church of St Nicholas at Aberdeen Her descendent Mr Thomson of Portlethem has an original picture of her father by himself Three small portraits  of the house of Haddington are in the possession of Thomas Hamilton Esq of Fala  Many of Jamesone's works are in both colleges of Aberdeen The Sibyls there it is said he drew from living beauties of that city Mr Baird of Auchmedden in Aberdeenshire has in one piece three young Ladies cousins of the houses of Argyle Errol and Kinnoul their ages six seven and eight as marked on the side of the picture The same Gentleman has a small whole length of William Earl of Pembroke by some ascribed to Vandyck At Mr Lindsay's of Wormeston in Fife is a double half length of two boys of that family playing with a dog their ages five and three  There is a perspective view of Edinburgh by Jamesone with a Neptune on the fore ground  Having finished a fine whole length of Charles I he expected the magistrates of Aberdeen would purchase it for their hall but they offering him too inconsiderable a price he sold it to a gentleman in the north of England  Jamesone had many scholars particularly Michael Wright mentioned in the third Volume of these Anecdotes His own portrait is in the Florentine chamber of Painters  Though Jamesone is little known in England his character as well as his works were greatly esteemed in his own country Arthur Johnston the Poet addressed to him an elegant Epigram on the picture of the Marchioness of Huntley which may be seen in the works of that author printed at Middleburgh in The portrait itself is extant in the collection of the Duke of Gordon and in the Newtoncollege of Aberdeen is the picture of Doctor Johnston himself by the same hand A Latin Elegy composed by David Wedderburn was  printed on his death which happened in at Edinburgh where he was interred in the churchyard by the Grayfriars but without any monument  By his will written with his own hand in July and breathing a spirit of much piety and benevolence he provides kindly for his wife and children and leaves many legacies to his relations and friends particularly to Lord Rothes the King's picture from head to foot and Mary with Martha in one piece to William Murray he gives the medals in his coffer makes a handsome provision for his natural daughter and bestows liberally on the poor That he should be in a condition to do all this seems extraordinary his prices having been so moderate for enumerating the debts due to him he charges Lady Haddington for a whole length of her husband and Lady Selon's of the same dimensions frames and all but three hundred marks and Lord Maxwell for his own picture and his Lady's to their knees one hundred marks both sums of Scots money  Mr Jamisone  So the name is now written not Jamesone  has likewise a memorandum written and signed by this Painter mentioning a MS in his possession "containing two hundred leaves of parchment of excellent write adorned with diverse historys of our Saviour curiously limned" which he values at two hundred pounds sterling a very large sum at that time What is become of that curious book is not known  WILLIAM DOBSON  whom King Charles called the English Tintoret was born in in St Andrew's parish in Holbourn his family had been gentlemen of  DOBSON  Bannerman Sculp  good rank at St Alban's but having fallen into decay he was put apprentice  R Symonds says he learned most of Old Cleyn  to Sir Robert Peake whom I have mentioned a painter and dealer in pictures Under him though no excellent performer but by the advantage of copying some pictures of Titian and Vandyck Dobson profited so much that a picture he had drawn being exposed in the window of a shop on Snowhill Vandyck passing by was struck with it and inquiring for the author found him at work in a poor garret from whence he took him and recommended him to the King On the death of Vandyck Dobson was appointed Serjeantpainter and groom of the privychamber and attended the King to Oxford and lodged in the highstreet almost over against St Mary's church in a house where some of his works remained 'till of late years At Oxford his Majesty Prince Rupert and several of the Nobility  The author of the Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres says that Dobson being overwhelmed with business thought of a lucky way to check it It was obliging persons who sat to him to pay half the price down and that he was the first who used this practice By the swarms of portraits that are left on the hands of his successors this method is either neglected or has very little effect  sat to him but the declension of the King's affairs proved fatal to Dobson he loved his pleasures and not having had time to enrich himself was involved in debts and thrown into prison from whence he was delivered by one Mr Vaughan of the Exchequer whose picture he drew and thought it the best of his portraits He enjoyed this release but a short time dying at the age of thirtysix he was buried at St Martin's October A short life in which he had promised much excellence His pictures are thought the best imitations of Vandyck they are undoubtedly very faithfull transcripts of nature He painted  history as well as portrait and even the latter generally containing more than a single figure rise almost above that denomination  Of the first sort is the Decollation of St John at Wilton It is in a good style but the colouring is raw The idea of St John is said to have been taken from the face of Prince Rupert At Chatsworth is a very particular picture said to be General Monke his child and his mistress whom he took against the consent of her husband The man in armour undoubtedly resembles Monke but the whole piece has the air of a holy family nor is there any other tradition of any mistress of Monke but the famous  See an account of her in Lord Clarendon's history of his life in Ludlow's memoires and in the collection of state poems vol i p  Anne Clarges whom he afterwards married and who some say was a milliner There are many instances of painters who have deified their mistresses but the character of the Virgin Mary was never more prostituted than if assumed by Anne Clarges Mr Stanley has a picture extremely like this by  At Albury in Surrey the seat of the Earl of Arundel was a picture by Dobson of the woman caught in adultery with several figures the heads taken from persons then living among whom was the poet Cowley At Chippenham in Cambridgeshire formerly the seat of Russel Earl of Orford in one piece are Prince Rupert Colonel John Russel and Mr William Murray drinking and dipping their favourribbands in the wine At Blenheim is a family by some said to be that of Francis Carter an architect and scholar of Inigo Jones by others of Lilly the Astrologer whom Vertue thought it resembled  But Whitlocke says that Lilly had no family  The man holds a pair of compasses I have seen nothing of Dobson preferable to this there is the utmost truth in it At Devonshirehouse  house is another family piece of Sir Thomas Brown author of Religio Medici his wife two sons and as many daughters Mr Willett merchant in Thamesstreet has a small familypiece of Dr Hibbard physician his wife and five children The father and mother are particularly well painted A little boy leans on the father's knee evidently borrowed from the wellknown attitude by Rubens of Sir B Gerbier's daughter Two children on the righthand were certainly added afterwards and are much inferior to the rest The dates were probably inserted at the same time A whole length of Sir William Compton is in the possession of the family At the Lord Byron's is the portrait of Sir Charles Lucas and at Drayton in Northamptonshire Henry Mordaunt Earl of Peterborough in armour with a page holding his horse and an angel giving him his helmet  The last circumstance may relate to his preservation in the Civil War in which he was wounded and made his escape when taken prisoner with Duke Hamilton and Lord Holland This picture has great merit  A head of the Marquis of Montrose was taken for the hand of Vandyck in a corner in stone colour is a statue of peace on the other side his helmet At Mr Skinner's Mr Walker's collection is a large piece of Prince Charles in armour drawn about Mr Windham a youth holding his helmet at bottom are arms and trophies I have mentioned a fine head of Vanderdort at Houghton Dobson's wife by him is on the stairs of the Ashmolean museum at Oxford and his own head is at Earl Paulett's the hands were added long since by Gibson as he himself told Vertue Charles Duke of Somerset had a picture of an old man sitting and his son behind him on this picture was written the following epigram published by John Elsum among his epigrams on  painting a work I have mentioned before though of no merit but by ascertaining some particular pictures  Page It is a thin octavo printed in with only his initial letters J E

th'roughly understood  A portrait not like paint but flesh and blood  And not to praise Dobson below his merit  This flesh and blood is quickened by a spirit  At Northumberlandhouse as I have said is a triple portrait of Sir Charles Cotterel embraced by Dobson and Sir Balthazar Gerbier in a white wastecoat Sir Charles was a great friend and patron of Dobson At Rousham in Oxfordshire the seat of the Cotterels are several good portraits by him Sir Charles Cotterel when at Oxford with the King was engaged by his majesty to translate Davila's history of the civil wars of France the frontispiece designed by Sir Charles himself was drawn by Dobson it represented Francis II Charles IX Henry III and IV with two dogs a popish and protestant cur fighting before them This sketch is still preserved in the family and in was engraved in London for the history of Thuanus He etched his own portrait  At Mr Nicholas's at Horseley is a portrait of Sir Richard Fanshaw which has been taken for the hand of Dobson it was painted by one De Meetre a name unknown to me  GERARD HONTHORST  TChambars sculp  In a collection of poems called Calanthe is an elegy on our painter  GERARD HONTHORST  The favorite painter of the Queen of Bohemia was born in at Utrecht and instructed in painting by Bloemart but he compleated his studies at Rome where he stayed several years and painted many things for Prince Justiniani and other works excelling particularly in nightpieces and candlelights On his return he married well and having a fair character was remarkable for the number of his disciples of rank Sandrart who was one says they were twentyeight at the same time who each payed him an hundred florins yearly But his greatest honour was instructing the Queen of Bohemia and her children  At Cashiobury Lord Essex's is a large picture of the Queen of Bohemia and her children by Honthorst The elder sons are killing monsters that represent Envy c The King of Bohemia like Jupiter with the Queen again like Juuo are in the clouds The head of the Queen not the latter is pretty well painted the rest very flat and poor  among whom the Princess  De Piles Of the Princess Sophia there is a

various countries and received florins for his labour He died at the Hague in Descamps in his second volume says that Honthorst brought to England Joachim Sandrart his scholar and that the king bespoke many pictures of him and that for the Earl of Arundel he copied from Holbein Henry th Sir T More Erasmus and several others and that he left England and went to Venice in I find no other authority for this account not one work of Sandrart is mentioned in K Charles's collection and what is more conclusive against his having been in England he takes not the least notice of it himself in the life of Honthorst tho' he relates his master's journey to England and his works here and calls himself one of his disciples  JOHN VAN BELCAMP  was employed under Vanderdort as a copyer of the

his son was buried in St Martin's in  JOHN DE CRITZ  has been mentioned in the former volume Though serjeant painter to Charles I He may more properly be called a retainer to the arts than a professor His life is to be collected rather from officebooks than from his works or his reputation Yet he was not ignorant I have two sketches of heads drawn by him with a pen that are masterly Vertue saw many more in the hands of Murray the painter who was scholar of a son or nephew of De Critz who according to Murray painted bravely scenes for masks Among those drawings was a sketch from a picture of  In the Earl of Oxford's library was a copy of Holland's Heroologia in which in an old hand supposed to be done immediately after the publication of the book in was written where every picture was from which the prints were taken That of Sir Philip Sidney is the same with Lord Chesterfield's and under was written  at Mr De Critz's  strong evidences of this being a genuine picture  Sir Philip Sidney then at the house of De Critz and now in the possession of Lord Chesterfield At Oatlands he painted a middle piece for a cieling which on the dispersion of the King's effects was sold for  l  In he painted the portrait of serjeant Maynard with a paper in his hand In a book belonging to the board of works was a payment to John De Critz for repairing pictures of Palma and the Caesars of Titian This was in Among the annuities and fees payable out of the customs in the port of London in that reign was a payment to John De Critz his majesty's serjeantpainter for his annuity at  l  a year due to him for one year ended at Michaelmas And in a wardrobe account lost in the fire in the temple was this entry "To John De Critz serjeantpainter for painting and gilding with good gold the body and carriages of  two coaches and the carriage of one chariot and other necessaries  l    s    d  anno " If this bill should seem to debase the dignity of serjeant painter it may comfort the profession to know that Solimeni who was inferior to no painter of any age in vanity whatever he was in merit painted a coach for the present King of Spain when King of Naples which cost  l  Indeed I can produce no precedent of any great master who painted and gilded barges as serjeant De Critz appears to have done by the following paper a memorandum in his own hand  "John De Critz demaundeth allowance for these parcells of Worke following viz For repayreing refreshing washing and varnishing the whole body of his majesty's privy barge  In the courtbooks at painter'shall there is a letter to the company from the Earl of Pembroke directing them to appoint certain persons of their hall to view the King's and Queen's barges lately beautified painted and gilded by De Creetz serjeantpainter and give an estimate of the work which they did of  l  and some other expences  and mending with fine gould and faire colours many and divers parts thereof as about the chaire of state the doores and most of the antiques about the windowes that had bene galled and defaced the two figures at the entrance being most new coloured and painted the Mercury and the lion that are fixed to the sternes of this and the

Fortitude most an end being quite new painted and guilded The border on the outside of the bulk being new layd with faire white and trayled over with greene according to the custom heretoforeand for baying and colouring the whole number of the oares for the row barge being thirtysix"  On the other side of this scrap of paper is another bill "For severall times oyling and laying with fayre white a stone for a sundyall opposite to some part of the King and Queen's lodgings the lines thereof being drawn in severall colours the letters directing to the howers guilded with fine gould as alsoe the

the sun at any time there shining shall be resident the whole worke being circumferenced with a frett painted in a manner of a stone one the compleat measure of the whole being six foote"  At bottom of each of these bills are the sketches of heads I mentioned De Critz and others were buyers of the King's goods to the value of  l  Rich Symonds says that at De Critz's house in Austinfryars were three rooms full of the King's pictures Emanuel De Critz brother or son was one of the petitioners to the council of state for delivery of the goods they had purchased which had been detained by Cromwell Thomas De Critz brother of John was a painter too and superior said Murray to his brother One of the name was macebearer to the house of parliament A head of one Oliver De Critz with a paper in his hand is in the museum at Oxford John De Critz had a scholar called Le Mense who was born at Antwerp  ADRIAN HANNEMAN  was born at the Hague and painted both history and portraits having studied under one Ravesteyn but more from the works of Vandyck of whose airs of heads Vertue thought him the best imitator He made  ADRLIN HANNEMAN  ABannerman Sculp  love as is said before to the niece of Cornelius Johnson though without success and drew that painter his wife and son He came to England in the reign of King Charles and for some time worked under Mytens and continued here sixteen years Returning to Holland he became the favorite painter of Mary Princess of Orange There is a picture of her and the Prince in armour at Lord Strafford's at Wentworthcastle painted I believe by Hanneman At Windsor  There were five other portraits of the royal family by him in the collection of James II See the catalogue  a portrait of Duke Hamilton at Worksop the Duke of Norfolk's a picture of kettles and utensils Sir Peter Lely had a man playing on a lute two feet ten square In the library belonging to the cathedral of Lincoln the portrait of one Honeywood whose mother lived to see of her own descendents There is a print of Charles II painted before his restoration by Hanneman engraved by Hen Danckers at the Hague and at General Compton's Vertue saw one done by Hanneman at the same time  English School  He painted in the chamber of the States at the Hague and for the Heer Van Wenwing two usurers counting their money while he worked on this he wanted a sum himself which he borrowed of the person who had ordered the picture and which when it was finished Wenwing would have deducted but Hanneman told him that all the gold he had borrowed was put into the picture and was what the misers were counting He died about His son called William was buried in St Martin's in  There were several other painters here in the reign of Charles who were so inconsiderable or of whom I find so little that I shall mention them very briefly  Cornelius Neve drew the portraits of Richard Lord Buckhurst and Mr Edward Sackville in one piece in It is at Knowle No in the picturegallery at Oxford is painted by him where he is called a celebrated painter In he drew the portrait of Mr Ashmole in his herald's coat  Ashmole's Diary p  K Coker painted a head of Colonel Massey preserved at Coddington in Cheshire  Matthew Goodricke or Gothericke is mentioned as a painter in one of the office books of that reign  In the inventory of the pictures at Oatlands was a view of Greenwich by Stalband and in Mr Harene's sale was an octagon landscape with the story of the Centurion by the same hand something in the manner of Paul Brill but the colours exceedingly bright and glaring And in another catalogue of the King's pictures was a prospect of Greenwich by Portman  Mr Greenbury is mentioned in the  Page  catalogue of the King's collection for copying two pictures of Albert Durer by the direction of the Lord Marshal Probably he was one of Lord Arundel's painters  Horatio Paulin lived chiefly in Holland He came to England went to Hamburgh and thence to the Holyland Rotiere agreed to go with him but was discouraged Descamps  Page vol iii  expresses surprize "that pious painters should have exhibited to the public very licentious  pieces and scandalous nudities" But by the account which he has given of Horatio Paulin he seemed to present himself with a very easy solution of this paradox Paulin set on foot a kind of promiscuous crusado to the Holyland they were stored with crosses relicks c and on the road made many proselytes of both sexes A baker's wife in particular was so devout that she thought it a meritorious action to plunder her husband of his plate that she might equip herself for the pilgrimage When the caravan was furnished by theft one may easily conceive why it's apostle painted indecent altarpieces  Povey lived in this reign and painted a head which was in the possession of Mr Leneve Norroy  One Hamilton an Englishman is mentioned by  Page  Sandrart as excelling in painting birds and grapes and doing several things for the Elector of Brandenburgh  Edward Bower drew the portrait of Mr Pym an equestrian figure of General Fairfax and John Lord Finch of Fordwich The two last were engraved by Hollar  Holderness drew the picture of an old woman with a skull which was in the collection of Villiers Duke of Buckingham  T Johnson made a draught of Canterbury in which hangs on the stairs of the library belonging to the cathedral  Reurie is mentioned by  In his Graphice  Sanderson as a painter in little in  FRANCIS BARLOW  was of more note than the preceding artists  See English School  He was born in Lincolnshire and placed with one Sheperd a facepainter but his taste lay to birds fish and animals in which he made great figure though his colouring was not equal to his designsconsequently which is not often the case the prints from his works did him more honour than the works themselves especially as he had the good fortune to have some of them engraved by Hollar and Faithorn  The title to one of his books in which some are etched by Hollar is "Diversae Avium species studiosissimé ad vitam delineatae per Fran Barlow ingeniofissimum Anglum pictorem Guil Faithorn excudit "  There are six books of animals from the drawings of Barlow and a set of cuts for Aesop's Fables Some cielings for birds he painted for noblemen and  At Clandon Lord Onslow's are five pieces by Barlow  gentlemen in the country and he drew some of the monuments in Westminsterabbey designed for an edition of Mr Keep's history of that cathedral Mr Symonds says he lived near the drum in Drurylane and received eight pounds for a picture of fishes He once painted a half length of General Monke and the herse was designed by him as was expressed in the Lord Chamberlain's warrant to Sir Christopher Wren to prepare timber for it at Monke's funeral I have a curious long roll engraved by White exhibiting the ceremonies and procession of that magnificent interment with a full description of it the frontispiece is well designed by Barlow It is remarkable that forty gentlemen of good families submitted to wait as mutes with their backs against the wall of the chamber where the body laid in state for three  weeks waiting alternately twenty each day Barlow though inheriting a large sum of money from a friend died poor so lately as  Sir TOBY MATTHEWS  one of those heteroclite animals who finds his place any where His father was Archbishop of York and he a jesuit He was supposed a wit and believed himself a politician His works are ridiculous and his greatest success was a little mischief in making converts  On the Lady Newburgh being converted to popery Lord Conway writes thus to the Earl of Strafford "The King did use such words of Wat Montagu and Sir Tobie Matthew that the fright made Wat keep his chamber longer than his sickness would have detained him and Don Tobiah was in such perplexity that I find he will make a very ill man to be a martyr but now the dog doth again wag his tail" Strafford papers vol ii p It seems in this business Matthews was unjustly accused the conversion had been made by the Duchess of Buckingham and Signor Con the Spanish resident p  The famous Countess of Carlisle as meddling as Matthews and as affected was the object of his adoration He drew a character of her  See this character prefixed to his letters  which commends her so impertinently that with scarce straining it might pass for a satire For instance he says "She has as much sense and gratitude for the actions of friendship as so extreme a beauty will give her leave to entertain and that although she began to be civil to people at first she would rather show what she could do than let her nature continue in it and that she never considered merit in others but in proportion as they had any to her That she affected particularity so much that you might fear to be less valued by her for obliging her that she had little religion was passionate could suffer no condition but plenty  and glory was fickle and gay only out of contradiction because her physicians had told her she was inclined to melancholy"with a heap of such nonsensein short I believe no proud beauty was ever so well flattered to her own contentment Mr Garrard master of the charterhouse a man of more sense and more plain sense than Matthews has drawn this Lady's character in fewer words and upon the whole not very unlike Sir Toby's picture "My lady Carlisle will be respected and observed by her superiors be feared by those that will make themselves her equals and will not suffer herself to be beloved but of those that are her servants"  Strafford papers vol i p  Sir Toby Matthews's title to a place in this work depends singly upon a letter from the Duchess of Buckingham to the Duke  R Symondes says Mr Gage Sir Thoby Matthewes Mr Fl  ill were buyers of pictures for the Duke of Buckingham  in which she tells him she had not yet seen the picture which Toby Matthews had drawn of the Infanta and sent over Vertue adds that he had some small skill in limning otherwise I should have concluded that he had only drawn the Infanta's portrait in the same fantastic colours which he had employed on Lady Carlisle However as it is not foreign to the design of this work to throw in as many lights as possible on the manners of the several ages I did not unwillingly adopt Vertue's mistake if it is one Whoever desires to know more of this person will find his life in the Athenae Oxonienses But I have not yet done with these motley characters the King's taste made his court affect to be painters and virtuosi among these was  Sir JAMES PALMER  often mentioned in the catalogue of the royal collection in which he  sold gave and painted pictures Of the latter was a  Page for the others see p  piece of Tarquin and Lucretia copied from Titian Another the feast of Bacchus was delivered to him by the King's own hands to be copied in tapestry at the manufacture in Mortlack He had lodgings in the tenniscourt at Whitehall and is often mentioned as a domestic servant  He was chancellor of the garter and married Katherine eldest daughter of William Lord Powys widow of Sir Robert Vaughan and was father of Roger Palmer Earl of Castlemain husband of the Duchess of Cleveland  He was the person sent to Richard Atkyns for the picture in which the King distinguished two different painters and Mr Garrard in a letter to Lord Strafford dated Jan says "I had almost forgot to tell your Lordship that the diceingnight the King carried away in James Palmer's hat pieces The Queen was his half and brought him that good luck she shared presently " In Stone's accounts from which I have given some extracts above is mention of a monument for Palmer's wife If these men add no great ornament to our list it will at least be honoured by our next the Hogarth of poetry was a painter too I mean  SAMUEL BUTLER  the author of Hudibras In his life prefixed to his works we are told "That for his diversion he practiced music and painting I have seen adds the writer some pictures said to be of his drawing which remained  Several are actually extant in the possession of a person in Worcestershire  in that family of Mr Jefferys which I mention not for the excellency of them but to satisfy the reader of his early inclinations to that noble  art for which also he was afterwards entirely beloved by Mr Samuel Cooper one of the most eminent painters of his time"  FRANCIS CLEYN  was a painter in a different style from any we had seen here for which reason though he arrived earlier than many I have mentioned I reserved him 'till I had dispatched the performers in oil He was born at Rostock and retained in the service of Christian IV King of Denmark but the excellence of his genius prompted him to the search of better models than he found in that northern climate He travelled to Italy and stayed there four years it was at Rome I suppose he learned those beautifull grotesques in which he afterwards shone At Venice he became known to Sir Henry Wotton and Sir Robert Anstruther recommended him to Prince Charles He arrived while the Prince was in Spain but notwithstanding was graciously received by King James who mentions that circumstance in a Latin letter that he wrote to the King of Denmark desiring leave to detain Cleyn in England though with a permission to return first to Copenhagen and finish a work he had begun there and promising to pay the expence of his journey The letter is preserved by Fuller  In his Worthies of Surrey p  The request was granted and Cleyn returned to London at the end of the summer The King had just then given two thousand pounds towards Sir Francis Crane's new manufacture of tapestry at Mortlack They had worked only after old patterns Cleyn was placed there and gave designs both in history and grotesque which carried those works to singular perfection It appears by King Charles's catalogue that five of the cartoons were sent  FRANCESCO CLEYN  TChambars sculp  thither to be copied by him in tapestry His pension is recorded by Rymer  Vol xviii p  "Know yee that we do give and graunt unto Francis Cleyne a certain annuitie of one hundred pounds by the year during his natural life" He enjoyed this salary 'till the civil war and was in such favour with the King and in such reputation that on a small drawing of him in Indian ink about six inches square which Vertue saw he is called Il famosissimo pittore Francesco Cleyn miracolo del secolo e molto stimato del re Carlo della gran Britania " Cleyn was not employed solely in the works at Mortlack he had a house near the church in Coventgarden and did several other things for the King and Nobility At Somersethouse he painted a cieling of a room near the gallery with histories and compartments in gold The outside of Wimbledonhouse he painted in fresco Bolsover in Nottinghamshire Stonepark in Northamptonshire and Carewhouse at Parson'sgreen since Lord Peterborough's were ornamented by him There is still extant a beautifull chamber adorned by him at Hollandhouse with a cieling in grotesque and small compartments on the chimnies in the style and not unworthy of Parmegiano Two chairs carved and gilt with large shells for backs belonging to the same room were undoubtedly from his designs and are evidences of his taste A letter  Strafford papers  from Lord Cottington to Lord Strafford describing the former's house at Hanworth mentions Cleyn though not by name "There is a certain large low room made under the building with a fountain in it and other rare devises and the open gallery is all painted by the hand of a second Titian Aug " In King Charles's catalogue is mention of four  patterns for the great seal drawings  I am informed that some drawings by Cleyn are in the possession of the Earl of Moray in Scotland  on blue paper by Cleyn He made designs for various artists particularly for several of Hollar's plates to Virgil and Aesop for these he received fifty shillings a piece There are two small books of foliages from his drawings one containing six small slips with animals in grotesque the other in five slips of the senses and the initial letters of his name F C inv And two books for carvers goldsmiths c containing plates It is however uncertain whether these and a few other plates of the same kind are not by his son who had the same christian name and imitated his father's manner Such is a titlepage to Lacrymae Musarum elegies on the Lord Hastings who died in the day before he was to have been married Also seven plates of the liberal arts about four or five inches square prettily designed and neatly etched On a small print of the father etched by the son Mr Evelyn wrote "A most pious man father of two sons who were incomparable painters in miniature all died in London" By the register of Mortlack it appears that he had three sons Francis born in who died and was buried at Coventgarden October Charles and John and two daughters Sarah and Magdalen He had another daughter probably born in London and called Penelope Vertue saw a miniature like Cooper's manner but not so well of Dorothea youngest daughter of Richard Cromwell act with these letters P C which he thought signified Penelope Cleyn  At Burleigh is a head of Cecil Lord Roos with the same letters  In the catalogue of plates and prints exhibited to sale by Peter Stent was a book of grotesques in ten plates Francis Cleyn inv et sculpsit Cleyn besides his own  sons instructed Dobson and died himself about Mr English  He etched a small print from Titian Christ and the two Disciples at Emaus  a painter who died at Mortlack in had a picture of Cleyn and his wife and several of his designs for tapestries all which came to Mr Crawley of  Hempsted  Hertfordshire Richard Symonds in one of his pocketbooks mentions another piece of Cleyn and his family by candlelight and a copy by the son of a sacrifice from Raphael which was in the royal collection and a drawing on coloured paper At Kensington I have lately found a picture which I do not doubt is of Cleyn's hand It represents Christ and Mary in a chamber the walls and windows of which are painted in grotesque Different rooms are seen through the doors in one I suppose is Martha employed in the business of the family There is merit in this piece particularly in the perspective and grotesques the latter of which and the figures in the manner of the Venetian school make me not hesitate to ascribe it to this master  JOHN HOSKINS  For the life of this valuable master I find fewer  There is not even a portrait of him extant  materials than of almost any man in the list who arrived to so much excellence Vertue knew no more of him than what was contained in Graham's English School where we are only told "that he was bred a facepainter in oil but afterwards taking to miniature far exceeded what he did before that he drew King Charles his Queen and most of the court and had two considerable disciples Alexander and Samuel Cooper the latter of whom became much the more eminent limner" Hoskins though  surpassed by his scholar the younger Cooper was a very good painter there is great truth and nature in his heads but the carnations are too bricky and want a degradation and variety of tints I have a head of serjeant Maynard by him boldly painted and in a manly style though not without these faults and another good one of Lord Falkland more descriptive of his patriot melancholy than the common prints it was in the collection of Dr Meade  At Burleigh is a portrait of David Cecil son of John th Earl of Exeter by Frances daughter of the Earl of Rutland it is dated and another of Sir Edward Cecil afterwards Viscount Wimbledon  There is indeed one  Since the first edition of this book I have seen another at Burleigh scarce inferior It is the profile of a boy in brown holding in one hand a plaything like castanets It is admirably natural  work of Hoskins that may be called perfect it is a head of a man rather young in the gown of a master of arts and a red satten wastecoat The clearness of the colouring is equal to either Oliver the dishevelled hair touched with exquisite freedom It is in the possession of Mr Fanshaw but not known whose portrait Vertue mentions a son of Hoskins of the same name and says that this mark  distinguishes the works of the father from those of the son which have I H simply I meet with no other hint of a son of that name except in Sanderson who barely names him  Page In the same place he speaks in the like transient manner of a son of Hilliard  One Peter Hoskins is entered into the register of Coventgarden as buried July Hoskins the father was buried in that church Feb In the  Page  catalogue of King Charles are mentioned two drawings by Hoskins for the great seal  Colonel Sothby has a head of Sir Benjamin Rudyard by him and a profile which Vertue thought might be Hoskins himself Prefixed to Coryat's Crudities is a copy of verses with his name to them  ALEXANDER COOPER  was nephew of Hoskins and with his brother Samuel of whom an account will be given in the ensuing volume was instructed in watercolours by their uncle Alexander painted landscapes in this manner as well as portraits At Burleigh is the Story of Acteon and Diana by him He went abroad resided some time at Amsterdam and at last entered into the service of Queen Christina  ANNE CARLISLE  a paintress admired for her copies it is not said whether in oil or miniature from Italian masters Graham  English School  says she was in such favour with King Charles that he presented her and Vandyck with as much ultramarine at one time as cost him above five hundred pounds If her share was near equal I should suppose she painted in oil It would be a very long time before the worth of  l  in ultramarine could be employed in miniatures Vertue mentions her teaching a lady to paint whose picture she drew standing behind her own herself was sitting with a book of drawings in her lap and he adds that many pieces painted by her were in the possession of a widow Lady Cotterel Mrs Carlisle died about  JOHN PETITOT  was patronized by the two monarchs who of late years have given the noblest encouragement to artists Charles st and Louis th He deserved their protection as a genius and has never been equalled in enamel Zincke alone has once or twice and but once or twice produced works that might stand in competition with any single performance of Petitot  The latter was born at Geneva in his father a sculptor and architect having passed part of his life in Italy had retired to that city The son was designed for a jeweller and having frequent occasion to make use of enamel he attained such a tone of colour that Bordier who afterwards became his brotherinlaw conceived that if Petitot would apply himself to portrait he might carry the art to great perfection Though both wanted several colours which they knew not how to prepare for the fire their attempts had great success Petitot executed the heads and hands Bordier the hair draperies and grounds  In this intercourse of social labour the two friends set out for Italy As painters the treasures of the art were open to them as enamellers they improved too by frequenting the best chymists of that country but it was in England that they were so fortunate as to learn the choicest secrets in the branch to which they had devoted themselves Sir Theodore Mayern first physician to Charles and a great chymist communicated to them the process of the principal colours which ought to be employed in enamel and which surpassed the famous vitrifications of Venice and Limoges  Mayern introduced Petitot to the King who knighted and gave him an apartment in Whitehall The French author of the Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres whom I copy and am sorry to criticize while I am indebted to him says that Vandyck seeing some designs of Petitot at the King's goldsmith's and informing himself of the author advised him to quit the profession of jeweller and apply himself to painting portraits in enamel But the biographer had told us that that step was already taken and surely had not been abandoned during a long stay in Italy What the same writer adds that Vandyck gave him instructions when Petitot copied the works of that master and that his copies from Vandyck are his best performances is much more agreeable to probability and fact The magnificent whole length of Rachel de Rouvigny Countess of Southampton in the collection of the Duke of Devonshire is painted from the original in oil by Vandyck in the possession of Lord Hardwicke and is indubitably the most capital work in enamel in the world it is nine inches three quarters high by five inches and three quarters wide and though the enamel is not perfect in some trifling parts the execution is the boldest and the colouring the most rich and beautifull that can be imagined It is dated His Grace has a head of the Duke of Buckingham by the same hand with the painter's name and the date consequently a copy performed  It is evidently copied from the Duke's portrait in his familypiece by Honthorst at Kensington  after the Duke's death In the same collection is a portrait of a middleaged man in armour inclosed in a case of tortoishel the person unknown but inferior to none I have seen of this master The Duchess of Portland has another of the Duke of Buckingham exactly the same as the preceding Charles  first and his Queen and the Lady Morton governess of the royal children who is celebrated by Waller I have a fine head of Charles st in armour for which he probably sat as it is not like any I have seen by Vandyck James d when Duke of York freely painted though highly finished and I suppose done in France a very large and capital one of his sister Henrietta Duchess of Orleans exquisitely laboured a very small but fine head of Anne of Austria another of Madame de Montespan and a few more of less note but all of them touched in that minute and delicate style into which he afterwards fell in France and which though more laboured has less merit in richness of tints than his English works Vanderdort mentions a carving by Petitot from Titian's Lucretia in which way I find no other account of his attempts though as his father was a sculptor he probably had given his son some instructions  The tragic death of his royal protector was a dreadful stroke says his biographer to Petitot who attended the exiled family to Paris I question as so few English portraits appear by his hand and none that I know later than whether the Civil War did not early drive him back to France but Bordier undoubtedly remained here sometime longer having been employed by the parliament to paint a memorial of the battle of Naseby which they presented to Fairfax their victorious general This singular curiosity is now in my possession purchased from the Museum of Thoresby who  I have the receipt of the executors of Fairfax to Thoresby who paid  l  for his purchases He has at the end of his Ducatus Leodiensis in the account of his own Museum given a more minute description of these enamels  bought it with other rarities from the executors of Fairfax It consists of two round plates each but an inch and half diameter and originally served I  suppose for the top and bottom of a watch such enamelled plates being frequent to old watches instead of crystals On the outside of that which I take for the bottom is a representation of the House of Commons as exhibited on their seals by Simon Nothing can be more perfect than these diminutive figures of many even the countenances are distinguishable On the other piece within is delineated the battle of Naseby on the outside is Fairfax himself on his chestnut horse men engaging at a distance The figure and horse are copied from Vandyck but with a freedom and richness of colouring perhaps surpassing that great master Under the horse one reads P B fecit This is the single work which can with certainty be allotted to Bordier alone and which demonstrates how unjustly his fame has been absorbed in the renown of his brotherinlaw Charles d during his abode in that kingdom took great notice of Petitot and introduced him to Louis who when the restoration happened retained Petitot in his own service gave him a pension and lodged him in the Louvre Small portraits of that monarch by this great enameller are extremely common and of the two Queens his mother and wife  In he married Margaret Cuper the celebrated Drelincourt performed the ceremony at Charenton for Petitot was a zealous protestant and dreading the consequences of the revocation of the edict of Nantes in he begged permission of the King to retire to Geneva Louis who did not care to part with so favorite a painter and who perhaps thought that an enameller's religion was not composed of sterner stuff than the great Turenne's eluded his demand and at last being pressed with repeated memorials sent Petitot to Fortl'eveque and Bossuet to convert him The subtle apostle who had woven such a texure of devotion and ambition that the latter was  scarce distinguishable from the former had the mortification of not succeeding and Petitot's chagrin bringing on a fever he at last obtained his liberty now almost arrived at the age of fourscore which makes it probable that his conversion rather than his pencil had been the foundation of detaining him He no sooner was free than he escaped with his wife to Geneva in His children who dreaded the King's wrath remained at Paris and throwing themselves at his feet implored his protection His Majesty says my author received them with great goodness and told them he willingly forgave an old man who had a whim of being buried with his fathersI do not doubt but this is given and passed at the time for a bonmotbut a very flat witticism cannot depreciate the glory of a confessor who has suffered imprisonment resisted eloquence and sacrificed the emoluments of courtfavour to the uprightness of his conscience Petitot did not wish to be buried with his fathers but to die in their religion  Returned to his country the good old man continued his darling profession The King and Queen of Poland desired to be painted by his hand and sent their portraits to be copied by him in enamel but the messenger finding him departed proceeded to Geneva where he executed them with all the vigour of his early pencil The Queen was represented sitting on a trophy and holding the picture of the King For this piece he received an hundred Louis d'or's  So great was the concourse to visit him that he was obliged to quit Geneva and retire to Veray a little town in the canton of Berne where as he was painting his wife an illness seized and carried him off in a day in at the age of fourscore and four He had had seventeen children one of his daughters a widow was living in My portrait of Charles st came from one of his sons who was a major  in our service Of the rest one only attached himself to his father's art and practiced in London his father often sending him his works for models This son painted in miniature too and left descendents who are settled at Dublin  It is idle to write a panegyric on the greatest man in any vocation That rank dispenses with encomiums as they are never wanted but where they may be contested Petitot generally used plates of gold or silver seldom copper In the dawn of his reputation he received twenty guineas for a picture which price he afterwards raised to forty His custom was to have a painter to draw the likeness in oil from which he made his sketches and then finished them from the life Those of Louis he copied from the best pictures of him but generally obtained one or two sittings for the completion His biographer says that he often added  He specifies one at Paris of Michel L'asne the engraver a large oval with hands of which one rests on his breast  hands to his portraits I have seen but one such the whole length of Lady Southampton and that at Loretto there is of his work an incomparable picture of the Virgin A collector at Paris possesses more than thirty of this great master's performances particularly the portraits of Mesdames de la Valiere Montespan Fontanges c Another has those of the famous Countess d'Olonne the Duchess of Bouillon and other ladies of the court Van Gunst engraved after Petitot the portrait of Chevreau  Of Bordier we have no fuller account than this incidental mention of him yet I have shown that his is no trifling claim to a principal place among those artists whose works we have most reason to boast I wish this clue may lead to farther discoveries concerning him  I come now to other artists in the reign of Charles and first of statuaries  ANDREW KEARNE  a German was brother of Nicholas Stone the elder for whom he worked Kearne too carved many statues for Sir Justinian Isham at his house near Northampton At Somersetstairs he carved the Rivergod which answered to the Nile made by Stone and a lioness on the watergate of Yorkstairs For the

his works consisting of altarpieces and cielings of churches were destroyed in the fire of London One of his cielings was in the church of Coventgarden For some time he worked under Vandyck and several of his performances are at the Duke of Rutland's at Belvoir A book of freezework in eight leaves etched in was I suppose by the hand of the father as to him must be referred an entry in an officebook where he is mentioned for painting and gilding frames of pictures at Somersethouse at two shillings the foot Feb He also agrees to paint and gild the chimney piece in the crossgallery there for eight pounds Dobson drew his picture He died a few years after the restoration and was buried at Stamford He had three sons who all says Graham  English School  became famous in their different ways One was John Pierce a painter of the third I find no account of his profession the other was Edward the statuary and architect He made the statues of Sir Thomas Gresham of Edward III at the Royalexchange and of Sir William Walworth at Fishmonger'shall a marble bust of Thomas Evans master of and a great benefactor to the company of painters in The bust is in their hall a model of the head of Milton which Vertue had the bust of Sir Christopher Wren in the picturegallery at Oxford and a bust of Cromwell sold at an auction in He much assisted Sir Christopher in many of his designs and built the church of St Clement under his direction Edward Pierce too carved the four dragons  on the monument at fifty pounds each The whole cost of that column exclusive of the dragons and of the

Smithfield was a surveyor and carver to the King as he is called in a book belonging to the board of works in In he is mentioned for carving the frames of the pictures in the crossgallery at Somersethouse at two shillings and twopence per foot He carved some things too at  One Bowden a captain of the trainedbands was another carver at Wilton I believe at the same time with Taylor  Wilton

abovementioned others were gilt for Vianen complained that by the expence of the work and the treblegilding he was a great loser and desired to be considered The designs themselves were thought so

Vanderdort mentions in the royal collection a little figure of a cupid sitting on a horse running by Fanelli and calls him  the oneeyed Italian  The figures of Charles I and his Queen in niches in the quadrangle of St John's college Oxford were cast by him and are well designed They were the gift of Archbishop Laud and were buried for security in the civil war William Duke of Newcastle was a patron of Fanelli and bought many of his works still at Welbeck particularly a head in brass of Prince Charles with the founder's name behind the pedestal Fr Fanellius Florentinus sculptor magn Brit regis

shall now set down what little I have to say of the medallists of King Charles Briot has been mentioned under the preceding reign He and T Simon his disciple possessed the royal favour 'till the beginning of the troubles when Simon falling off to the parliament  I have already referred the reader to Vertue's account of the two Simons and their works which he intended as a part of this history of the arts which is too long to transcribe here and which wou'd be mangled by an abridgment Abraham Simon one of the brothers a man of a very singular character had fancied that the Queen of Sweden was in love with him and at last had an ambition of being a bishop  a new medallist was employed on the few works executed for the King during the remainder of his life his name was  THOMAS RAWLINS  The first work by which he was known to the public was of a nature very foreign from his profession in he wrote a play called The Rebellion  See Langbaine p Subjoined to a book called Goodfriday being

the greatest in his profession that has appeared in these kingdoms and so great that in that reign of arts we scarce know the name of another architect was  INIGO JONES  who if a table of fame like that in the Tatler were to be formed for men of real and indisputable genius in every country would save England from the disgrace of not having her representative among the arts She adopted Holbein and Vandyck she borrowed Rubens she produced Inigo Jones Vitruvius drew up his Grammar Palladio showed him the practice Rome displayed a theatre worthy of his emulation and King Charles was ready to encourage employ and reward his talents This is the history of Inigo Jones as a genius The particulars of his life have been often written and therefore I shall run them over very briefly adding some less known minutiae which I fear are the characteristics of these volumes and some catalogue of his works  He was born about the son of a clothworker and by the most probable accounts bound apprentice to a joiner but even in that obscure situation the brightness of his capacity burst forth so strongly that he was taken notice of by one of the great Lords at court some say it was the Earl of Arundel the greater  Among whom is Loyd in his Memoires p  number that it was William Earl of Pembroke though against that opinion there is at least a negative evidence which I shall mention presently By one of these Lords Inigo was sent to Italy to study landscapepainting to which his inclination then pointed and for which that he had a talent appears  INIGO JONES  ABannerman Sculp  by a small piece preserved at Chiswick the colouring is very indifferent but the trees freely and masterly imagined He was no sooner at Rome than he found himself in his sphere He felt that nature had not formed him to decorate cabinets but design palaces He dropped the pencil and conceived Whitehall In the state of Venice he saw the works of Palladio and learned how beautifully taste may be exerted on a less theatre than the capital of an empire How his abilities distinguished themselves in a spot where they certainly had no opportunity to act  Though no building at Venice is attributed to Inigo the palace and a front of a church at Leghorn are said to be designed by him  we are not told though it would not be the least curious part of his history certain it is that on the strength of his reputation at Venice Christian IV invited him to Denmark and appointed him his architect but on what buildings he was employed in that country we are yet to learn James I found him at Copenhagen and Queen Anne took him in the quality of her architect to Scotland He served Prince Henry in the same capacity and the place of surveyorgeneral of the works was granted to him in reversion On the death of that Prince with whom at least all his lamented qualities did not die Jones travelled once more to Italy and assisted by ripeness of judgment perfected his taste To the interval between those voyages I should be inclined to assign those buildings of Inigo which are less pure and border too much upon that bastard style which one calls  King James's Gothic  Inigo's designs of that period are not Gothic but have a littleness of parts and a weight of ornaments with which the revival of the Grecian taste was encumbered and which he shook of in his grander designs The surveyor's place fell and he returned to England and as if architecture was not all he had  learned at Rome with an air of Roman disinterestedness he gave up the profits of his office which he found extremely in debt and prevailed on the comptroller and paymaster to imitate his example 'till the whole arrears were cleared  In the reign of James I find a payment by a warrant from the council to Inigo Jones Thomas Baldwin William Portington and George Weale officers of his majesty's works for certain scaffolds and other works by them made by the command of the Lord Chamberlain against the arraignment of the Earl of Somerset and the Countess his Lady The expence was twenty pounds  In the Foedera  Vol xviii p See also in the Strafford papers some letters of Mr Garrard which contain an account of proceedings under that commission by virtue of which twenty newly erected houses in St Martin'slane were pulled down  is a commission to the Earl of Arundel Inigo Jones and several others to prevent building on new foundations within two miles of London and palace of Westminster  In he was employed in a manner very unworthy of his genius King James set him upon discovering that is guessing who were the founders of Stonehenge His ideas were all romanized consequently his partiality to his favorite people which ought rather to have prevented him from charging them with that mass of barbarous clumsiness made him conclude it a Roman Temple It is remarkable that whoever has treated of that monument has bestowed it on whatever class of antiquity he was peculiarly fond of and there is not a heap of stones in these Northern countries from which nothing can be proved but has been made to depose in favour of some of these fantastic hypotheses Where there was so much room for vision the Phoenicians could not avoid coming in for their share of the foundation and for  Mr Toland's part he discovered a little stonehenge in Ireland built by the Druidess Gealcopa who does not know the Druidess Gealcopa who lived at Inisoen in the county of Donnegal  See a summary of this controversy in the life of Inigo Jones in the Biographia Britannica  In the same year Jones was appointed one of the commissioners for the repair of St Paul's but which was not commenced 'till the year when Laud then Bishop of London laid the first stone and Inigo the fourth In the restoration of that cathedral he made two capital faults He first renewed the sides with very bad Gothic and then added a Roman portico magnificent and beautifull indeed but which had no affinity with the ancient parts that remained and made his own Gothic appear ten times heavier He committed the same error at Winchester thrusting a screen in the Roman or Grecian taste into the middle of that cathedral Jones indeed was by no means successfull when he attempted Gothic The chapel of Lincoln'sinn has none of the characteristics of that architecture The cloyster beneath seems oppressed by the weight of the building above  In Dugdale's Origines Judiciales p is an account of the building of that chapel from a design of Inigo The first proposal of building it was in but it was retarded 'till about The charge was estimated at two thousand pounds It was finished in five years and consecrated on Ascensionday by the Bishop of London Dr Donne preaching the sermon  The authors of the life of Jones place the erection of the banquettinghouse in the reign of King Charles but as I have shown from the accounts of Nicholas Stone it was begun in and finished in two yearsa small part of the pile designed for the palace of our Kings but so compleat in itself that it stands a model of the most pure and beautifull taste Several plates of the intended palace of  Whitehall have been given but I believe from no finished design The four great sheets are evidently made up from general hints nor could such a source of invention and taste as the mind of Inigo ever produce so much sameness The strange kind of cherubims on the towers at the end are proposterous ornaments and whether of Inigo or not bear no relation to the rest The great towers in the front are too near and evidently borrowed from what he had seen in Gothic not in Roman buildings The circular court is a picturesque thought but without meaning or utility The whole fabric however was so glorious an idea that one forgets for a moment in the regret for it's not being executed the confirmation of our liberties obtained by a melancholy scene that passed before the windows of that very banquettinghouse  In he was employed at Somersethouse where a chapel was to be fitted up for the Infanta the intended bride of the Prince  Sir H Bourgchier in a letter to archbishop Usher dated July says "The new chapel for the Insanta goes on in building" There was another chapel erected for her at St James's of which Don Carlos Colonna laid the first stone V Rushworth  The chapel is still in being The front to the river part only of what was designed and the watergate were erected afterwards on the designs of Inigo as was the gate at Yorkstairs  Upon the accession of Charles he was continued in his posts under both King and Queen His fee as surveyor was eight shillings and fourpence per day with an allowance of fortysix pounds a year for houserent besides a clerk and incidental expences What greater rewards he had are not upon record Considering the havoc made in offices and repositories during the war one is glad of being able to recover the smallest notices  During the prosperous state of the King's affairs the pleasures of the court were carried on with much taste and magnificence Poetry painting music and architecture were all called in to make them rational amusements and I have no doubt but the celebrated festivals of Louis XIV were copied from the shows exhibited at Whitehall in it's time the most polite court in Europe Ben Johnson was the laureat Inigo Jones the inventor of the decorations Laniere and Ferabosco composed the simphonies the King the Queen and the young nobility danced in the interludes We have accounts of many of these entertainments called masques They had been introduced by Anne of Denmark I shall mention those in which Jones was concerned  Hymenaei or solemnities of masque and barriers performed on the twelfthnight upon occasion of the marriage of Robert Earl of Essex and the Lady Frances daughter of the Earl of Suffolk at court by Ben Johnson Master Alphonso Ferabosco sung master Thomas Giles made and taught the dances  Tethys's festival a masque presented on the creation of Henry Prince of Wales June The words by S Daniel the scenery contrived and described by master Inigo Jones This was called the Queen's wake Several of the Lords and Ladies acted in it Daniel owns that the machinery and contrivance and ornaments of the scenes made the most conspicuous part of the entertainment  February a masque at Whitehall on the nuptials of the Palsgrave and the Princess Elizabeth invented and fashioned by our kingdom's most artfull and ingenious architect Inigo Jones digested and written by the ingenious poet George Chapman  Chapman was an intimate friend of Jones and in dedicated his translation of Musaeus "To the most generally ingenious and learned architect of his time Inigo Jones  Esq  surveyor of his majesty's works" See Wood's Athenac p Jones made the monument for Chapman in the churchyard of St Gyles  Jones had dabled in poetry himself there is a copy of verses by him prefixed to Coryat's Crudities among many others by the wits of that age who all affected to turn Coryat's book into ridicule but which at least is not so foolish as their verses  Pan's anniversary a masque at court before King James I Inventors Inigo Jones and Ben Johnson

invention ornaments scenes and apparitions with their descriptions were made by Inigo  Jones surveyorgeneral of his majesty's works what was spoken or sung by William Davenant her majesty's servant  Love's mistress or the Queen's masque three times presented before their Majesties at the Phoenix in Drurylane T Heywood gives the highest commendation of Inigo's part in this performance  Lord Burlington had a folio of the designs for these solemnities by Inigo's own hand consisting of habits masks scenes c  The harmony of these triumphs was a little interrupted by a war that broke out between the composers Inigo and Ben in which whoever was the aggressor the turbulent temper of Johnson took care to be most in the wrong Nothing exceeds the grossness of the language that he poured out except the badness of the verses that were the vehicle There he fully exerted all that brutal abuse which his cotemporaries were willing to think wit because they were afraid of it and which only serves to shew the arrogance of the man who presumed to satirize Jones and rival Shakespeare With the latter indeed he had not the smallest pretensions to be compared except in having sometimes writ absolute nonsense Johnson translated the ancients Shakespeare transfused their very soul into his writings  Another person who seems to have born much resentment to Jones was Philip Earl of Pembroke  R Symondes calls him the bawling coward  in the Harleian library was an edition of Stonehenge which formerly belonged to that Earl and the margins of which were full of strange notes writ by him not on the work but on the author or any thing else I have such another commonplace book if one may call it so of Earl Philip the life of Sir Thomas More In the Stonehenge are memorandums jokes witticisms and  abuse on several persons particularly on Cromwell and his daughters and on Inigo whom his Lordship calls Iniquity Jones and says he had  l  a year for keeping the King's houses in repair This might be exaggerated but a little supplies the want I have mentioned of any record of the rewards bestowed on so great a man It is observable that the Earl who does not spare reflections on his architect never objects to him his having been maintained in Italy by Earl William nor does Webb in his preface to the Stonehenge though he speaks of Inigo's being in Italy say a word of any patron that sent him thither Earl Philip's resentment to Jones was probably occasioned by some disagreement while the latter was employed at Wilton There he built that noble front and a grotto at the end of the water Wilton is one of the principal objects in a history of the arts and Belles Lettres Sir Philip Sidney wrote his Arcadia there for his sister Vandyck drew many of the race Holbein and Inigo Jones imagined the buildings Earl Thomas compleated the collection of pictures and assembled that throng of statues and the last Earl Henry has shown by a bridge designed by himself that had Jones never lived Wilton might yet have been a villa worthy of ancient Rome  The works of Inigo are not scarce though some that bear his name were productions of his scholars some indeed neither of the one nor the other Albins in Essex I should attribute to the last class though always ascribed to Inigo If he had any hand in it it must have been during his first profession and before he had seen any good buildings The house is handsome has large rooms and rich cielings but all entirely of the King James's Gothic Pishiobury in Hertfordshire is said to have been built by him for Sir Walter Mildmay At Woburn is a grottochamber and some other small parts by him as there is of  his hand at Thorneyabbey and a summerhouse at Lord Barrington's in Berkshire The middle part of each end of the quadrangle at St John's Oxford is ascribed to him The supporters of the royal arms are strangly crouded in over the niches but I have seen instances of his overdoing ornament Charltonhouse in Kent is another of his supposed works but some critics have thought that only the great gate at the entrance and the colonades may be of his hand The cabinet at Whitehall for the King's pictures was built by him but we have no drawing of it At St James's he designed the Queen's chapel Surgeon'shall is one of his best works and of the most admired the arcade of Coventgarden and the church two structures of which I want taste to see the beauties In the arcade there is nothing remarkable the pilasters are as errant and homely stripes as any plaisterer would make The barnroof over the portico of the church strikes my eyes with as little idea of dignity or beauty  In justice to Inigo one must own that the defect is not in the architect but in the orderwho ever saw a beautifull Tuscan building would the Romans have chosen that order for a temple Mr Onslow the late speaker told me an anecdote that corroborates my opinion of this building When the Earl of Bedsord sent for Inigo he told him he wanted a chapel for the parishioners of Coventgarden but added he wou'd not go to any considerable expence in short said he I wou'd not have it much better than a barnwell then replied Jones you shall have the handsomest barn in England  as it could do if it covered nothing but a barn The expence of building that church was  l  Ambresbury in Wiltshire was designed by him but executed by his scholar Webb who married a cousingerman of Jones Chevening is another house ascribed to him but doubtfull Gunnersbury near Brentford was certainly his the portico is too large and engrosses the whole  front except a single window at each end The staircase and salon are noble but destroy the rest of the house the other chambers are small and crouded by vast chimneypieces placed with an Italian negligence in any corner of the room Lindseyhouse  Jones was one of the first that observed the same gradual diminution of pilasters as in pillars Lindseyhouse owes it's chief grace to this singularity  in Lincoln'sinnfields has a chaster front but is not better disposed for the apartments In a special commission was issued to the Lord Chancellor the Earls of Worcester Pembroke Arundel and others to plant and reduce to uniformity Lincoln's innfields  That square is laid out with a regard to so trifling a circumstance as to be of the exact dimensions of one of the pyramids This would have been admired in those ages when the keep at Kenelworthcastle was erected in the form of a horsefetter and the Escurial in the shape of St Laurence's gridiron  as it shall be drawn by way of map or groundplot by Inigo Jones surveyor general of the works Coleshill in Berkshire the seat of Sir Matthew Pleydell built in and Cobhamhall in Kent were his He was employed to rebuild CastleAshby and finished one front but the civil war interrupted his progress there and at Stokepark in Northamptonshire Shaftsburyhouse now the Londonlyingin hospital on the east side of Aldersgatestreet is a beautifull front at Wing seven miles from his present seat at Ethorp in Buckinghamshire Sir William Stanhope pulled down a house built by Inigo The front to the garden of Hinton St George in Somersetshire the seat of Earl Poulet and the front of Brympton formerly the mansion of Sir Philip Sydenham were from designs of Jones as Chilhamcastle and the tower of the church at Staines where Inigo sometime lived are said to be So is a very curious work if really by him as I know no other performance of his in that kind a bridge at Gwydder in Wales on the estate of the Duke of  Ancaster Some alterations and additions he made at Sion At Oatlands remains a gate of the old palace but removed to a little distance and repaired with the addition of an inscription by the present Earl of Lincoln The Grange the seat of the Lord Chancellor Henley in Hampshire is entirely of this master It is not a large house but by far one of the best proofs of his taste The hall which opens to a small vestibule with a cupola and the staircase adjoining are beautifull models of the purest and most classic antiquity The gate of Beaufortgarden at Chelsea designed by Jones was purchased by Lord Burlington and transported to Chiswick where in a temple are some wooden seats with lions and other animals for arms not of his most delicate imagination brought from Tarthall He drew a plan for a palace at Newmarket but not that wretched hovel that stands there at present The last and one of the most beautifull of his works that I shall mention is the Queen's house at Greenwich The first idea of the hospital is said to have been taken by Webb from his papers The rest of his designs and his smaller works as chimnies and cielings c may be seen in the editions of Kent Ware Vardy and Campbell  Dr Clarke of Oxford had Jones's Palladio with his own notes and observations in Italian which the doctor bequeathed to Worcester college The Duke of Devonshire has another with the notes in Latin Lord Burlington had a Vitruvius noted by him in the same manner The same Lord had his head by Dobson At Houghton it is by Vandyck Hollar engraved one of them Villamena made a print of him while he was in Italy Among the Strassord papers there is a letter from Lord Cottington to the Lord deputy sending him a memorial from Inigo relating to the procurement of marble from Ireland  Inigo tasted early of the misfortunes of his master He was not only a favorite  In Vanderdort's catalogue is mention of a picture of Stenwyck bought by Inigo for the King p and of a waxen picture of Henry VIII and a drawing of Prince Henry presented by him p  but a Roman catholic In he paid  l  for his delinquency and sequestration Whether it was before or after this fine I know not that he and Stone buried their joint stock of ready money in Scotlandyard but an order being published to encourage the informers of such concealments and four persons being privy to the spot where the money was hid it was taken up and reburied in Lambethmarsh  Grief misfortunes and age terminated his life He died at Somersethouse July and on the th of the same month was buried in the church of St Bennet's Paul'swharf where a monument  The  on the frame of his picture when bought by Sir Robert Walpole  ermine and ermine a lion rampant or within a border  of the same  erected to his memory was destroyed in the fire of London  I here conclude this long chapter on the reign of King Charles The admirers of that Prince will not think I hope that I have stinted them in anecdotes of their favorite monarch  The next scarce deserves the name of a chapter it contains the few names we find of  Major General Lambert  ABannerman Sculp  ANECDOTES of PAINTING  c  CHAP III  ARTISTS during the INTERREGNUM  OF these the first in rank if not in merit was  GENERAL LAMBERT  who we are told by the author of the English School was a great encourager of painting and a good performer in flowers some of his works were at the Duke of Leeds's at Wimbleton and it was supposed that he received instructions from Baptist Gaspars whom he retained in his service The General's son John Lambert painted portraits There is a medal of

Monsieur le Compte D'Hollande  MONSEIGNEUR  MONS L' Abé de Scagliá m'a commende de vous faire ceste despesche pour la necessité qu'il y a que les affaires soient advancées et poussés comme il dist dens le grand chemain Il y a un mois que j'ay envoyé une despesche a Mons le Duc pour rendre compte de ce qu'il m'avoist enchargé et de ce que Mons de Scaglia avoist a dire la dicte despesche estant arivée trois jours appres le despart de Monseigneur le Duc Sa Maj a pleu la lire et m'honnorer de ces commends par une lettre que Mons de Montagu m'a apportée  du secretaire Canvué En m'a precedente lettre j'ay faict recitt de ce que ce pouvoist apprendré issi des plus fraiches nouvelles de France et de ce que Mons L' Abé de Scaglia avoit appris a Brusselles Estant le sommaire une tres remarquable disposition qu' avoist L' Infante et le Marquis Spignola a un accomodement luy aiant demandé sils se pouvoient asseurer que L' Engleterre leur donneroist bien deux mois de temps pour reçeveoir les ordres requis d'Espagne Or est il qu'en suitte de la derniere lettre de Rubens par la quelle il desiroist un entreveve de luy et de moye en Hollande ie luy procuray un passeport du Prince d' Oranges Il ce transporta de Brusselles a Breda d'ou il mescript qu'il avoist ordre de ces maistres de ne passer plus oultre que Zenenberghen plasse neutre et ou autrefois ceux qui firent les premieres ouvertures de la France sentrevoioient m'asseurant par sa lettre qu'il me feroist veoir clairement que ceste punctualite estoist fondée sur des raisons justes equitables et tendantes a l'advancement de l'affaire mais aiant en singuliere recommendation d'acompagner les ordres que Mons le Duc m'a donnee avecq les sircumstansses requises a la reputation da sa Maj ie montray la lettre a Mons Carleton et luy dis que ie nestois nullement d'avis de bouger de la Haye ou des environs et fis response au dict Sr Rubens que ie luy avois envoyé un passeport a sa requisition en vertu duquel il pouvoist sans auqune difficulté ce transporter luy et ses valets en telle plasse de la Hollande qu'il luy plaisait que s'il faisoit difficulté de venir a la Haye ie lirois trouver a Delf ou Rotterdam comme appert par les copies des lettres issi enclosses Il me fist response et sçaveoir quil partoit promtement pour Brusselles pour receveoir aultres ordres estant tres sensible de quelque ombrage que ie pourois prende comme appert par cest lettre incluse  quil escript a Mons L' Abé de Scagliá protestant que ceste resolution avoist esté prise pour le bien de l'affaire ce qu'il m'eust tres particulierement faict entendre Quelque jours appres il arriva a Delf qui etoist le du mois de Juillet où il m'a representé que si Don Diego Messias qui est encore a Paris n'eust tardé si long temps il n'eust pasdesiré de me veoir avant son arrivée parce que L' Infante attandant par luy tout ordre ne sçavoit que dire mais craignant que l' Engleterre prinst quelque ombrage de la longeur d'Espagne elle lavoist envoyé pour m'asseurer de son integritté de son Zelle et sincere intention En un mot pour faire cognoistre que les ordres eussent estes plustost envoyés si l'Espagne n'eust pris c'este resolution d'envoyer Don Diego Messia lequel a ce quil dist a faict telle diligence qu'il est party le lendemain de ces fiançailles le dict Don Diego aiant aussi tardé plus long temps par les chemains pour raison d'une fievure tierce laquelle le tient encore a Paris la seconde raison pourquoy ils avoyent envoyé le Sr Rubens estoist pour entendre si l'on avoist advancé pour procur  r a la concurence des estats et si l'on avoist meditté sur les expedients necessaires pour facilliter les affaires ou les plus grandes difficultes et obstacles ce rencontreroient en celles de Hollande Que l'Espagne avoist escript en ces termes Vous continuerez de traitter avec Gerbier jusques a ce que Don Diego vienne non seulement d'un acomodement entre l'Espagne et l'Engletere mais aussi pour l'Alesmagne et l'Hollande Que l'Empereur mesme avoist escript tres exactement a l'Infante que si auqúun traitté passoit par ces mains quil seroist tres contant que les affaires d'Alesmagne s'acommodassent et qu'il tesmoigneroist d'estre un Prince Chrestien Le dict Rubens faisant des grandes instances pour sçaveoir a quel expediants l'on avoist pensez  Je luy fis responsse que par l'escript qu' avoist esté envoyé le de mars pour responsse de ceux que j'avois apportée de la part de l'Infante la Balle comme dire estoist mise a leur pietz que c'estoist a eux de parler que le temps ne permet pas puis que nous ne voions encore aultre certittude de leur part que parolles de faire auqúune ouverture que bien estoist vray que Mons Carleton se devoist disposer a faire tout debvoir mais qu'il nestoist possible d'avancer l'affaire sens que de la part d'Espagne l'on ne vist des tesmoignages eficatieux sur quoy il me dict que la serenissime Infante sçavoit bien quil ne se pouvoist rien faire sans les ordres requis et si long temps attendus mais que son voiage tendant a nous asseurer de la bonne intention et nous leuer de toutte doubte seroist acompagné de quelque advancement si en attendant la venue de Don diego Messias il ce pouvoist trouver quelques expediants pour donner lumiere a l'acheminement du traitté et quainssi il retourneroit avecque quelque fruict Je luy dis que pour corespondre aus asseurances qu'il apportoist de la bonne intention de l'Infante Que ie le pouvois asseurer de celle de sa Maj Et puis qu'il avoist maintenant licence de ce promener par les villes de Hollande que j'avrois loisir de veoir Mons Carleton lequel pouroist dire son sentiment sur quelques expedians de la part duquel ie luy ay dict a son despart qu'il sesvertuera tant que sera possible a meditter sur les expediants necessaires et quen attandant qu'il avoist pensé a deux estant toutesfois dict par maniere de discours scaveoir si pour l'Electorat il se pouvoist adjouster uné voix davantage au colege et que le survivant des deux succederoist le second que dens lacommodement affin d'interesser le Prince se rendasse la ville de Breda Quand aux plus difficiles comme se qui regarde ce mot de p'ays libre et lestroitte  confederation ratifiée il y a deux ans qu'il esperoist de trouver jour estant son intention de la proposer au roy a mon retour lors que le dict Sr Rubens feroist veoir ce que Don Diego Messias apporteroist Il a promis qu'il feroist toutte diligence et sur ce ay esté obligé d'attendre de ces premieres nouvelles par advis de Mons Carleton J'ay faict entendre au dict Rub la ligue que le roy de France pretend de faire avecq les Princes catholiques d'Alesmagne L'argent quelle a promis de fournir aux estats sur les premieres nouvelles quelle aura que l'armes des estats aura assiegeé quelque plasse de sortte que Mons Rubens avecq plusieurs aultres discours qu'avons eu ensemble sur la raison d'Estast que le roy d'Espagne devroit plustost aveoir de souffeir un Prince de la relision en Alesmagne sen est allé avecq la puce a l'Oreille esperant a la venue de Don Diego Messias comme a un Messie Les protestations qu'ils font et la necessite qui les semble presser donne de l'aparence si ce nest que l'Espagne trompe mesme l'Infante ce que ce cognoistra bien tost car Rubens a promis que s'il s'apercevoit de telle chose il en adverteroist promtement  J'avois faict mention en ma premiere lettre que l'on pouvoist aisement remarquer que plusieurs de ca pa'ys panchoient du costé de la France et que la plus grand part avoyent une tres grande aprehention de ceste rupture entre la France et l'Engleterre Je m'estois advise denploier mon temps a faire quelque recoevil des mesmoires que j'ay des affaires passées et le communiquant avec Mons L' Abé de Scaglia Il a adioutté ce qu'il a creu estre convenable et utille L'aiant reduit en uné fasson de Lunettes d'Hollande pour faire veoir la veritté et la forme des affaires Je luy escript en langue Françoise pour la traduire appres en flamang aveeq intention de le destribuer par escript  parmy ceux qui ont le plus de pouvoir et de sentiment en ce pa'ys si telle estoist la volonte de sa Maj c'est pourquoy ie l'envoye icy jointe vous suppliant den dire vostre sentiment  L'Ambass de Savoye m'a dict que les desputés des estats ont estes invistez et porttez escripre en France touchant l'interest qu'ils ont de la mauvaise inteligence de ces deux couronnes Que pourtant ils prient sa Maj doublier les offences receves et de vouloir suspendre les actes d'hostillité contre l'Engleterre representant particulierement que ce desordre portte la ruinne de cest estats Laquelle lettre a esté faictte par l'artifice du Cardinal de Richelieu pour la faire inprimer a Paris affin que ceux de la relision de France voient que les actions d'Engleterre sont mesmes odieuses a ces amis affin qu'ils croient qu'il y a mesme de la desunion avecque ces estats et faire paroistre qu'il a eu raison de portter le roy son maistre a des animosites contre l'Engleterre puis que les estrangers mesmes cognoissent que la France par elle a esté offencée  Nonobstant ceste ditte lettre que l'on croist estre solicittée par Artsen lequel s'est faict cognoistre du tout François en ceste conjuncture Les estats cognoisent bien que l'Engleterre ne peut pour ces interets n'y pour sa reputation permettre la pertte de la Rochelle comme aussi que la France aye grandes forces en Mer et destre pour les mesmes repects aussi bien interessez que l'Engleterre qui donne assez de subject de croire quil y a de la necessité de les pousser n'y ayant pas de doutte quils suivroit tout a faict l'Engleterre en ce quelle vousdroit traitter d'une paix d'Espagne estants hors de toutte sortte despoir d'assistance de la France et font bien veoir le sentiment qu'ils en ont s'aiant la province d'Hollande esvertuée de fournir deux millions de  livres plus que par le passé pour suppleter a ce que la France manque Le S  r  Rubens a veu lettres escriptes de France a l'Infante et Marquis Spignola lesquelles sont dressées par le Cardinal de Richelieu disant lors que Mons de Montagu parloit au Duc de Savoye touchant les affaires de la France et l'Engleterre que l'Ambassadeur de France la resident estoist caché derriere la tapisserie pour ovir tout ce que ce disoit ceste fourbe estant controuvée pour faire croire que la France est recherchée par l'Engleterre et que mesmes la France est si esloignée de vouloir acommodement que ces ministres ne veulent pas paroistre ou sont ceux d'Engleterre pour traitter avecques eux  Le Cardinal de Richelieu aiant ombrage du voiage de Messias se disant en France que c'est pour traitter avecq l'Engleterre il a faict promtement escripre une lettre a Artsen si tost que l'armée des estats assiegeroient une plasse de l'ennemy que la France leur fera tenir cinq cents mille livres esperant par ce moien et par les m livres qu'ils ont fourny au roy de Dennemarque d'apportter lenpeschement a l'acommodement des affaires entre l'Espagne et l'Engleterre cest un argument que la France ne faict rien de bon que par crainte et quand elle est forcée Le bien qu' a desia aportté le bruict de quelque traitté avecque l'Espagne maxime certain que l'entretien en est bon  Les Lettres de Paris du font mention d'une soulevation qu'il y a eu dens Bourdeaux n'aiants voulu accepter les nouveux edits Ceux de Bourdeaux n'ont aussi voulu publier la desfence du commerce avecque l'Engleterre Mons L' Abé de Scaglia m'a induit descrire qu'il seroist d'avis en ceste disposition de leur faire sçaveoir de les vouloir traitter en amis a condition qu'ils soient obliger d'assister ce que le roy de la grand Bretagne entreprendra a leur advantage Monsieur  de Rohan a faict responsse au roy par son agent que le roy luy avoit envoyé pour tirer promesse de luy qu'il n'eust pas a ce remùer Il a respondu qu'il se fera recognoistre bon serviteur du roy pourveu que la Rochelle soit remise en toutte sortte de libertté ce que faict cognoistre au roy que la deliberation des armes que Mons de Rohan prend est avecque le consentment des Eglises de France Il a fait retirer Madâme de Rohan a Geneve et sen va en Italie affin que personne ne soupsonne quelle sollicette le roy pour son mary  La Rochelle avoist faict pendre quelques uns qui avoient voulu persuader le peuple de s'unir avecque le roy  Mons de Guise est tres mal satisfaict pour le commendement donné a Mons d'Angoulesme Il estoist party vers Poittoù environ quattre ou cinq mille hommes et doibt estre la a la fin du mois de Juillet Je ne puis obmettre de faire recitt de la bonne repartie que Mons L'Abé de Scaglia a faict a l'Embassadeur de France et celuy de Venise issi resident lesquelles pressoient fort qu'il ce devoist entremettre en un acommodement qu'il falloit procurer que la France vint a une suspention d'armes sur quoy L' Abé de Scaglia demende si la France avoist des piques longues de Calais a Douure car pour d'aultres armes il n'en cognoissoit pas  Jay representé a Mons de Scaglia ce que Mons Canoué m'a commandè de la part du roy le dict Scaglia m'a faict veoir en mesme temps ce quil escrivoit a son Altetze touchant les affaires pour le tenir tousiours disposé au dessain de sa Maj et dy engager ces amis ce qu'il avoit recommendé avecque toute l'ardeur que l'on pouvoist sonhaister Pour ce que regarde le voyage du Baron de Puseol il attend responsse d'un jour a aultre de tout ce que l'on peut desirer de sa negotiation  estant party d'icy avecque touttes les instructions et mesmoires necessaires il ne doutte quil n'aye bien servy Pour les affaires de Geneve il a dict a Mons de Montagù en ma presence comme il poura asseurer son Altesse de tout ce que le roy luy a ordonné et de plus que sa Maj est authourdhuy au point de rendre si grand servisse a ceux de son party en France qu'il luy donnera tant plus d'advantage et d'authoritté parmy ceux de Geneve et ailleurs que l'on pouvoist attendre quelque bon succes L'Abe de Scaglia s'asseurant que son Maistre le trouvera bon Monsieur de Montagu s'en va bien instruit de ce qu'il aura a saire avecq Soissons particullierement sur l'ocasion de la Maladie du roy laquelle enpirant pouroist bien changer beaucoup de choses aultrement s'il tombe en fievure cartte comme l'on dict desia cela fortifiera les mal contents de France et donnera toutte sortte d'advantage a ceux qui en sçavront profitter et quelque sortte de minne qu'ils fassent ils sont a present bien enpeschez car indubitablement yl y aura beaucoup de brouilliers dens touttes le provinces de la France qui les rendront inutilles au roy pour le secours qu'il en pouvoist aveoir tiré jusques a tant que l'on soit en estast de faire d'avantage comme Mons de Scaglia croit que sera si les affaires de Savoye et de Genes sachevent  L'Abe de Scaglia avroist desiré de passer au plustost en Engleterre vers sa Maj mais est en ce point qu'il attend quelque responsse de Madame de Soissons il desire de pouvoir conclure avecq Mons de Candalle qui luy a promis de s'unir avecq Mons le Compte de Soissons lequel n'attend qu'une responsse pour establir ceste affaire la mais il espere de partir dicy au plus tard en quinse jours ou trois semaines et desire que le vaisseau revienne envers le dict temps  L'Ambass de France a fort desiré de pouvoir escripre quelque chose du retour de Mons de Montagu il s'est adresse a Mons de Scaglia lequel luy a faict des responses assez ridicules en particulier luy a proposé de demander a Mons Carleton passeport pour asseurer les vaisseaux du roy de France qu'il voisdroit bien faire partir de ces ports  J'avois touché en m'a precedente lettre comme l'Ambass de Venice et l'Agent de Florence residant en Engleterre sont personnes qui interprettent en mal tout ce qui ce faisoit en Engleterre donnent les advis aux ennemis de la couronne et estoient personnes dangereuses en aiant souvent ouy des estranges raports Mons de Scaglia dict sur cela qu'il faut veoir de mettre l'affaire tout bellement en tel estast que l'on aye a parler sens portter prejudice a l'Ambass de Venice qui est en France parce que les principalles choses que Mons L'Abé de Scaglia a scù il les a de celuy de Paris lequel est maintenant suspect a celuy d'Engleterre  Mais touchant cest agent de Florence qui est a Londres Le Sr Vertselin m'a souvent donné des advis pour les dire a Mons le Duc ne pouvant le dict Vertselin souffrir les malices lesquelles il faisoist paroistre Et j'ay remarqué selon les paroles que le dict Vertselin m'a dittes que sens doubte cest agent de Florence a faict ce petit livret intittullé la cronique des favorits et dedie a Mons le Duc de Buckingham dens lequel ie trouve les mesmes termes que le Vertselin m'a raconté Mons de Scaglia m'a faict tenir le livret que japortteray quand et moy sa Maj m'aiant faict l'honneur de me commander par le secretaire Canové d'en faire raport a qui j'ay aussi escript un peu plus briefvement et pour ne manquer a mon deveoir ie n'ay voullu faillir de vous en donner la cognoissance  Authourdhuy sont venues les lettres de France vielles de jours Le roy est encore a Villeroy fort mal sa fievure est double tierce avecque laccident de la dissanterie le rend en tres mauvais estast les astrologues disant sa fin toutes les affaires cessent et plusieurs tant dehors que dedans sont aux atentes il fust dict au roy que le Cardinal de Richelieu lavoit servy avecque beaucoup de passion il dict ces mots il est vray ie le sçay bien mais le peuple se plaint fort  Ils ont taché dacepter le gouvernement de Grandmont mais il la refusé Mons D'Espernon c'est retiré a Bergerac disant puis qu'il ne peut enpesscher la soulevation du peuple qu' aussi ne veust il estre present si quelque mal arivoit  Monsieur d'Angoulesme a este commendé de s'arester a Nior qui est a lieves de la Rochelle ils ont levé toutte les garnisons tant de Boulogne et quartiers sircomvoisins pour les envoyer a Mons d'Angoulesme Madame la Contesse de Soissons a mandé que le mariage luv plaist mais dict a Mons de Scaglia quelle ne peut resoudre que jusques a ce que ceste maladie du roy prenne fin  L'Ambassadeur de Savoye a escript par homme expres la necessite qu'il y a que Mons le Compte se desclare et prenne resolution principallement durant la maladie du roy  Don Diego Messias est fort malade a Paris d'une fievre tierce Je crains fort un prolonguement aux affaires par ceste maladie  Monsieur de Crecy aiant mande un courier pour faire sçaveoir au roy de l'armement de Mons de Savoye et l'ombrage que l'on devoit prendre de Mons de Soissons le roy a mande a Mons de Crecy de ne bouger des frontierres et qu'il luy envoieroit le regiment du Prince de Phalsbourgh le fils du Cardinal de Guise qui fust tué a Blois quil les  reduiroit a trois mille le regiment du cheu de Sault a deux mille et si cela ne suffit quil luy donne ordre d'en faire encore cinq mille et cinq cents cheuaus  Mons de Louvieres estant mis en prison a la Bastille en l'ocasion de Chalais a demande a parler au Cardinal Richelieu le mesme jour a este mené a la Conciergerie où l'on faict son proces ce dict qu'il doibt aveoir nomme plusieurs personnes et en particulier Mons le grand prieur et Vandome  Mons Del Beuff solicitte pour le gouvernement de la Picardie  Le roy a este saigné quatre fois la fievre tierce redoubleé ne bouge pas du lict  Le Cardinal ce paigne de rage les cheveux et la barbe avecque les ongles ne permet que personne aproche du roy mesme la royne  Cest issi le sommaire de ce que les dernieres lettres
