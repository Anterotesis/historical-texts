 PATRIOTISM A MOCKHEROIC IN FIVE CANTOS  Behold thy Gods O Israel  KINGS  LONDON Printed for M HINXMAN in  PaternosterRow  Price Two Shillings and Sixpence  PATRIOTISM A MOCKHEROIC  CANTO I  'TWAS Night the Voice of Jollity was hush'd  Doz'd all her Vot'ries reasonably flush'd  Song Argument Invention Laughter Jest  Wit Bawdry Criticism sunk to rest  Scandal  had empty'd all his Tub on BUTE  Abuse of  Royalty  itself was mute  Sleep  in his pleasing Bands had all things ty'd  All but the Eyes of disappointed PRIDE  She lay revolving in her anxious mind  How  Resignation  had too much resign'd  That Places were dispens'd as others will'd  Made vacant some and Vacancies were fill'd  New Statesmen at the Helm usurp'd her Trade  And glibly sail'd the Ship without her Aid  Seeking Repose from Side to Side she flings  No Change of Posture Pause of Anguish brings  Each grinding Thought Alleviation scorns  And sharpens all the Goosedown into Thorns  Forth from the loathed Bed in haste she flew  And round her weary'd Limbs her Vestments threw  Enwrought with Gold in Lelac Purple dy'd  The Velvet cas'd her endless Length of Side  Two calveless Bags of Silk then stretch'd to see  If they could reach from Heel to distant Knee  Next Splayfoot Shoes she to her Insteps girt  Shoes which disdain'd yet still were doom'd to Dirt  Her Thigh sustain'd a Sword unknown to War  And beam'd upon her Breast a Silver Star  Whose Rays with magic Influence could warm  Almost to Consequence the languid Form  Accoutred thus forth of her Doors she went  And her dark Visit was to FACTION bent  Resolv'd like Heav'nrejected  Saul  to try  What Counsel t'other Party might supply  Onward she strides impatient of Delay  Flound'ring thro' ev'ry Kennel in her Way  Save that at  Charingcross  she slack'd her Tread  And thought she saw poor  Charles  without his Head  Rehast'ning on thro' the long  Strand  she came  Then pass'd the  Temple  and ador'd its Name  Now reach'd St  Paul's  and bless'd the Lord that there  Tho' He was prais'd 'twas with unwilling Pray'r  Next in a grateful Rapture stretch'd to  Bow  And heard th'  unmuffled  Tongue of Night strike Two  Acknowledging the Omen she advanc'd  While sudden Vigour thro' each Sinew danc'd  High on a hundred Columns whose dead Weight  Presses the rustic Base in aukward State  Where hardly they sustain their Shafts unbent  The Load of Cornice and of Pediment  Which rough with Sculpture in strong Emblem clad  Tells us That Riches make a City mad  The pond'rous Mansionhouse of FACTION stands  Rais'd by o'erreaching Heads and griping Hands  Before the Gate a Giant fierce and fell  Stalk'd  Opposition  dreadful Centinel  And  Who goes there  he cry'd  yourself explain  A Friend  she said  to Denmark not the Dane  Her wellknown Voice he recollected strait  Quick every Bolt shoots backward on the Gate  Bolts to endure which never own'd the Pow'r  But only made to serve the present Hour  And yet the very best for Strength and Size  The Blacksmith's  Place  and  Pension  could devise  Of canker'd Brass and rusty Ir'n each Door  Stood massive spirtled thick with human Gore  Which Popularity for ever draws  From Fools in PatriotRebellion's Cause  Open they burst with desperate Recoil  The jarring Hinges scream for want of Oil  Loud and discordant as when Civil Rage  Incites two kindred Armies to engage  Near  Aylesbury  first caught the horrid Sound  And echo'd all its Terrors with rebound  Concord  at distant  Stowe  perceiv'd the Yell  While down her illadapted Vizor fell  Extremest  Exeter  rock'd to the Noise  And aided its hoarse Thunder with her Voice  At once her Cyders sour and all around  Her Appleblossoms strew the blushing Ground  And now where yawn'd the Portal rude and vast  To FACTION'S Residence the Goddess past  Close to the Door in the first Vestibule  Sat  Clamour Riot Insult  and  Misrule  Stern  Menace Licence  grown to dang'rous size  Reproach  and an Insinitude of  Lyes  A thousand Voices bellow through the Room  A thousand Echoes clatter 'gainst the Dome  Copious but unconnected Eloquence  Words of fierce Import but of little Sense  Not meant to mean and therefore to appear  More irritative to the vulgar Ear  There might be heard 'midst other piercing Cries  Liberty Property and no Excise  Of  Magna Charta  the more dreadful Roar  Prerogative and arbitrary Pow'r  There  Habeascorpus  howl'd from Jail broke loose  Slav'ry and Privilege and wooden Shoes  Corruption Favourites and no Address  And uncontroul'd the Licence of the Press  Sounds that all Sense of Order could erase  But get the Man who breaks thro' all a Place  Stun'd with the deaf'ning Peal she pass'd along  Yet passing would caress the friendly Throng  Thro' vast Saloons which spoke  May'rroyal  State  Rich without Taste and without Grandeur great  Yet here the Chissel and the Pencil strove  Best to record the Objects of Moblove  Tribunes and Ephori and Demagogues  By Men call'd Patriots but by Gods plain Rogues  Such as provided they themselves grew great  Had no Objection to subvert a State  Nor wanted here each dirty dreadful Job  That  Faction  perpetrates to please the Mob  To please the Mob here mighty  Strafford  bled  And  Laud  laid down his venerable head  To please the Mob  Byng  stains the blushing Deep  And  Blakeney  earns a Peerage in his Sleep  To please the Mob our Fleets their Canvas strain  And Expeditions hide the wond'ring Main  The Main more wond'ring wafts us back alas  Thin'd from the Wars of  Rochfort  and  St Cas  What matter since Defeat our Joy inspires  And  Cassel  lost can light a thousand Fires  By having pleas'd the Mob here  Cromwell  stood  And shew'd how private thrives by public Good  And might have shewn us Gulls if Gulls could see  That  Slav'ry  tracks th' Abuse of  Liberty  Confess'd at length the PatriotTyrant reign'd  And snapt that Freedom  Charles  had only strain'd  Hampden  was here in his  Eidolon  here  A wouldbe Tutor to the Royal Heir  But he himself dwells in the Fields of Fame  Wedded to Liberty's immortal Name  And here in Tints more recent might be view'd  Instructive Picture of Court Gratitude  How round their Sov'reign his great Servants stand  While fierce  Rebellion  gores the bleeding Land  Faith Honour Duty Loyalty the Laws  Urge them no doubt to perish in his Cause  No but to serve with  Granville  they refuse  So great a Crime in Monarchs 'tis to  chuse  A hundred other equal Deeds appear  Nay half the  English  History was here  While over all the rest conspicuous shines  Old  Sarah  's Legacy in Golden Lines  Around in less Compartments were bestow'd  Of underling Incendiaries a Crowd  Such as employ'd the Pulpit or the Press  T' enforce the Doctrines of Licentiousness  Here  Party  canoniz'd such Denizens  Whose Ears had paid the Forfeit of their Pens  And while in all her glaring Daub she paints  Villains grow Heroes Scoundrels turn to Saints  Our Goddess midst the

his Care  All other Altars stood inconsecrate  For her's no Offering was too pure or great  Of solid Gold and of enormous size  Yet not so big her Belly as her Eyes  She stood and seem'd as she would

ne'er so duly paid  To any Folks as when we want their Aid  The Ceremony with Observance meek  She 'tended and when done began to speak  "O Thou for whom and from whom I was form'd  "Whose Counsel

stalk'd behind  For People out of Place are of one Mind  Jointly they hunt but Diff'rence and Debate  Come when they share the Bear'sskin of the State  And now in general Discourse they join  So tipsy with the Healths not with the Wine  That Custom Reason Fact are chang'd and chopp'd  To all that Modern Patriots adopt  All spoke and all advis'd a thousand Things  To buoy up Citizens and weigh down Kings  And some direct the Matter how to mince  And mean by evil Counsellors the Prince  How turn Militia to a CounterGuard  And while disbanded Valour they reward  Humanity can never be a Crime  They

of Reason goes to rule this Ball  Two Reigns she'd blunder'd thro' still uppermost  Quitted the third nor gave the fourth for lost  With Manna still her Tongue run o'er replete  Thick clammy mawkish purgatively sweet  And fell her Words like Hail in Summer Day  As hard as cold as apt to melt away  The  LinguaFranca  Sediment of School  Where She miss'd Science mark'd her still more Fool  Which

Table round  Some affirm'd positive some ask'd perplext  And some launch'd out in Notes upon the Text  Till one more audible than all the rest  With strong Exertion thus himself express'd  "Why sit we here projecting some new Blow  "Since FATE determins all Events below  "On that Tribunal let our Envoy wait  "And who so fit as FOLLY upon FATE"  Th' Advice was grateful to the gen'ral Ear  All beg'd

led or Bus'ness drove  But FOLLY sought her Library with Speed  For one she had for Show but not to read  There jumbling in her Head what she thought Thought  How best to find the trackless Road she sought  She chose t' essay the Force of her own Prate  Remembring to how many once 'twas Fate  And now the mystic Gibberish she tried  Something that neither promis'd nor deny'd  But drew one on to

intercepted Ray  Withdrew itself and died upon her Way  And now thro' Darkness palpable abhorr'd  Her groping Hands the doubtful Path explor'd  'Till nigh the Confines where the lower Sphere  Joins to

themselves can see  Now the receding Gloom her Sight renew'd  And cloath'd with Form each bright'ning Object stood  The opening Scene with Wonder she surveys  Not knowing that she travell'd her own Ways  Here for the upper Surface she discern'd  How Flatt'ry lay to bubling Lather churn'd  Whose Bottom form'd a thicker Sediment  Of coarse and clumsy Clergy Compliment  This happy Compost with its supple Oil  Invigorates and opes the fertile Soil  Calls forth each Seed of Dirt to bud and flow'r  And trick itself in all the Hues of Pow'r  While from her Urn Partiality supplies  The Stream to Blood and Merit she denies  Hence blooms th' unlearn'd Divine in all the Glow  His doublepetall'd Mitre can bestow  Hence spreads the Under Clerk his ample shoot  And strikes in the Revenue deep his Root  Hence high his flourish'd Head the Valet rears  And hence Attornies blossom into Peers  Still lower in their different Strata spread  As Levity thought fit to range were laid  Close in their Shells involv'd yet innocent  The unhatch'd Vermin of a Government  Here Grubs and Maggots Favour's Sunshine wait  To get new Shapes and wing the World in State  Or more industrious snug and warm as Milk  Spin their soft Nests and wrap themselves in Silk  Here Snails of Office thro' their slimy Tracks  Crawl off at last with Houses on their Backs  Hence Worms and Earwigs in new Figures sport  And tinge themselves in ev'ry Dye of Court  'Till pinch'd with Cold another Form they try  And dip their varying Films in LIBERTY  Here yet unfang'd wriggle the Viper Race  Which fond Administration broods in Place  'Till fatten'd on herself and fit for Strife  They thro' her Bowels gnaw their way to Life  Here public Zeal the Alligator hides  Her selfish Eggs and for their Birth provides  Of Incubation in no Need they stand  But hatch in Popularity's hot Sand  To prey with open Mouths away they scour  Yet seem to mourn the Country they devour  Now lower as she went the hoary Deep  Discovers where the Seeds of Metals sleep  She saw and lik'd to see the plodding Head  Do the World's Bus'ness yet be only Lead  That Impudence its Copper Birth forgot  Grows Brass and is important on the Spot  That Talk and Pertness still succeed by Din  And shine and tinkle in the Shape of Tin  That Ignorance and Meanness rais'd to Pow'r  Their low Materials quickly silver o'er  That Whig and Tory Principles unfold  Their like Constituence and turn to Gold  But Wit the Quicksilver escap'd her View  Or seeing what it was she little knew  Last saw where PartyGems their Rays refine  How Patriotism inflames the blazing Mine  She now perceiv'd from this instructive Sight  A kind of Reminiscence all was right  The Soul is never taught but recollects  The Traces of its prior Intellects  Acknowleges the State she held before  And owns the beaming Shield at Troy she bore  END OF CANTO IV  PATRIOTISM A MOCKHEROIC  CANTO V  OF perfect Diamond a solid Rock  Far from the Tempest's Beat and Earthquake's Shock  Its massive Spurs down to the Center shoots  Where endless Permanency binds the Roots  Upon its Summit awefully elate  Immoveably is fix'd the Throne of FATE  The wond'rous Pile no Mark of Structure shews  Unhewn unbuilt the living Quarry grows  Up the steep Height an Iron Causeway tends  And at the Footstool of the Monarch ends  Here FOLLY pass'd and as she climb'd the Mound  Hollow and loud her shuffling Steps resound  Rais'd on his Seat the hoary Sire appear'd  And spread profuse his ample Flow of Beard  No Condescension his firm Looks avow  Inexorable Sternness knits his Brow  Around him bawl but clam'rous to no End  The fond Addresses which we Mortals send  He to their Purport turns a deafen'd Ear  Or answers traversly the wasted Pray'r  To Spenthrift Sons eternal Fathers gives  And Health untaintable to modern Wives  The Maiden's pious Vows are still repaid  With Husbands bad at Board and worse abed  To  Britain  every Plume of Glory won  Sends Newspapers and all the Work's undone  Or just as Party thinks to crown her Pains  Gives Resolution and the Prince still reigns  Before his Feet was plac'd Slave of his Sway  NECESSITY whom Men and Gods obey  Her strong Righthand a pond'rous Hammer held  Her left with Adamantine Nails was fill'd  Close to her Side of Steel an Anvil rose  The sounding Anvil never feels Repose  With these on this as fast as FATE assents  She rivets Actions down to their Events  Millions of  Secondcauses  claim in vain  Their Seat usurp'd and urge their Right to reign  She holds Possession still while they pursue  For ever their rejected Suit anew  On ev'ry Side and scatter'd ev'ry Way  Her finish'd Labours in wild Parcels lay  Unrang'd by their Importance equal here  The Loss of Battles or at Whist appear  A Statesman chang'd or Lodging newly lett  Empires transferr'd or Fashions out of Date  The Joys the Woes th' Extinction of Man's Race  Serve but to make the Litter of the Place  Here trebly clench'd the dire Injunction lay  For War t' extend his yet too narrow Sway  Hunger or Lust the Contest first began  Ambition soon improv'd upon the Plan  Religion next inflam'd the fell Debate  And steel'd our Hearts and edg'd our Swords with Hate  Last Commerce for an endless Quarrel stood  And all before seem'd Penury of Blood  There was ordain'd Law should untie her Noose  And slip the Dogs of Licence and Abuse  To their own Kennels' Stench familiar grown  But pois'ning ev'ry Nose except their own  They with full Cry the dubious Scent explore  And trail wherever Scandal touch'd before  Still oh the Shame still the loud Yelp proceeds  And the first Head of all the Forest bleeds  Here in like Volume the Decree of FATE  Forbids that Madmen should divide the State  They with absurd illib'ral desp'rate Push  To shame ev'n Party and make Faction blush  Strive but in vain to alienate the Hearts  Of a whole People great in Arms and Arts  To us by Nature Reason Int'rest Blood  Conjoin'd and union'd by the circling Flood  Thro' these as FOLLY pass'd with tott'ring Gait  From thinking Hurry gave an Air of State  And tripping at the last unlucky Law  As Witches stumble o'er a Cross of Straw  She chanc'd to kick one Bundle light it roll'd  Into Existence in it was foretold  A  Mockheroic  should employ the Pains  Of venal Quills and Partyheated Brains  She on her Knees with Hands devoutly clos'd  At once her Message and herself expos'd  To whom in answer FATE "Thus far to come  "Swell all its Rage and lash itself to foam  "O'er ev'ry Mound of Decency to ride  "Has been allow'd to Riot's Moondrawn Tide  "Here its proud Waves shall stop the boist'rous Flood  "On which ye hull'd desert you in the Mud  "The Mists that veil the Morning of this Reign  "The Breath of Order shall disperse again  "Broke they shall scud before the piercing Ray  "And add new Glories to its Burst of Day  "See the glad Prospect shine a Briton born  "Whom Virtues more than you could wish adorn  "Gives Lustre to the Throne whose Deeds confess  "No Thirst of Pow'r except the Pow'r to bless  "Who from the Sceptre no Exemption draws  "And is but the first Subject of the Laws  "Ev'n  Monarch

owe  That Peace and Order are Things known below  That Man was taught with better Aim to push  Beyond his Acorn Feast and Bed of Rush  The rugged Cavern's Shelter to disown  And seek Convenience in the peopled Town  There to distinguish in Subjection mild  'Tween reasonably free and staring wild  Do thou forgive if stung with honest Pain  Too far o'er Satire's far too open Plain  I urge the sportive Steed while I pursue  Through his own Paths the blatant Beast in view  Do thou forgive if e'er I unexact  Of his own Dirt some little Specks contract  Hard were the Task to thrid so foul a Way  And yet no plashing of the Soil betray  But if provok'd to vindicate thy Laws  I dip my Pen in Truth and Virtue's Cause  If I when Scandal shoots her Load of Shame  Restore it honestly to whence it came  If my sole Aim is Licence to restrain  And laugh thy Rebels home to thee again  If undesirous of the Wreath of Bays  Nor over ticklish to the Straw of Praise  Unask'd unpromis'd if these Lines I pour  Convictiondrawn but from my Soul abhor  The Name of Satirist who to his Share  Needs but an Ear to rhime and Front to dare  To hide his splendid Bile in moral Mask  And set himself at once about his Task  As a rough WaterDog NewEngland's Breed  Fresh plaister'd from some Pond with Mud and Weed  Round from his Fleece the dirty Puddle shakes  Rejoicing in the Spatter that he makes  If These my Motives not alone forgive  But bid this JUST RETALIATION live  While Libels when they've flourish'd for a spirt  Fall like their Brother Leaves and rot to Dirt  FINIS
