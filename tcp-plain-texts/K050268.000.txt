 A BRIEF DEDUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL PROGRESS AND IMMENSE GREATNESS OF THE  British  Woollen Manufacture WITH  An  ENQUIRY  whether it be not at present in a very Declining Condition  The Reasons of its DECAY and the Only Means of its RECOVERY  LONDON  Printed And Sold by J ROBERTS in  WarwickLane  and A DODD at the  Peacock  without  TempleBar  Price One Shilling  THE PREFACE  AS all Evils are to be discovered before we can expect their Remedy this Work proceeds in that Order  We shall never attempt the restoring our Manufactures if we do not first enquire into the Causes of their Decay  The following Work does not complain of the Evil with Reproach and to expose the Indolence of the Age whatever Room there might have been for such a Satyr  But seriously represents the Grievance and earnestly moves our Superiors to apply the proper Remedies  It is not the War it is not the Ingratitude of This Power or the Inveteracy of That which can hurt the  British  Manufactures at least not fatally  Our Mischiefs are at Home and the Remedy is at Home We may cure the Evil with the utmost Ease  But if we will be  Felo de se  in Trade if we will cut the Throat of our own Manufactures if we will pull them down with our own Hands we should have our Trade Buried at a Crossway with a Stake driven thro' it and an Inscription  Here lies Buried the  English  Trade having destroy'd it self  This Tract regards no Faction or Parties no Complaint against publick or private Persons or Management but 'tis a Complaint of an unhappy Humour among us all that we will Discourage and Destroy our own Manufactures and ruin our selves  May the National Wisdom restrain this Folly may the Poor obtain such Help and Trade such Relief as the Distress of our Commerce and People call for and the End of this Work and the Author's Wish will be fully Answered  AN ACCOUNT of the  Present Condition  of the MANUFACTURES of GREAT BRITAIN  The INTRODUCTION  BEFORE I enter into the Substance of the Question now before me and that I may make as little Preamble as possible in a Thing of such Importance it is necessary to lay down in plain and direct Terms so as may admit of no Cavils or Disputes what I mean and how I would be understood by the Words  The Manufactures of Great Britain  By the Manufactures of  Great Britain  and of which I suggest that they are now in a declining and decaying Condition I mean the Woollen Manufactures such as Broad and Narrow Cloths Serges Kersies Druggets Bays Sayes Perpets Stuffs Stockings Hats Flannels and all those woollen Goods generally used for WearingApparel Furniture of Houses and suchlike necessary Purposes and as are made by the Labour of our People for Use or Sale at Home that is to say in  Great Britain  or for Exportation Abroad of whatever Kind and by whatever Names for they bear so great a Variety of Names especially the  Norwich  and  SpittleFields  Goods that it would be as endless as it is needless to enter into the Particulars  That this Manufacture is a thing of great Importance of a vast Magnitude and a Value beyond all possible Calculation I suppose I need not spend time to prove 'tis describ'd in the best manner to be understood by taking Notice that it not only uses and works up all the Wool which grows in  England  but a very great Quantity both from  Spain  and  Ireland Barbary Turkey  and other Places whereever it can be had and of which I shall have occasion to take notice again in its Place  That this Manufacture was once in a flourishing Condition vastly extended abroad and prodigiously consum'd at home was carried on to the Employment and Enriching of innumerable Multitudes of People and Families of People 'till it had made  England  where its Center is fix'd the most opulent populous wealthy and powerful Nation in the World all this I not acknowledge only but if it should be disputed am ready to make appear at large upon all Occasions  It is likewise evident that this flourishing Manufacture has risen from small Beginnings and was at first rescued as it were out of Captivity in a strange Land where like  Israel  in  Egypt  it suffer'd Bondage and was engross'd by Foreigners who had no Title to it having none of its Principles no Materials for carrying it on  De Jure  in their own Right no nor  De Facto  in their Possession but serch'd them from us and then arbitrarily sold back the Goods made of them to us at their own Price enriching their People with the Profits of the Manufacture while  Spaniard  like we starv'd with the Mines of Gold in our own keeping  From this CaptiveState this miserable abandon'd Condition it was rescued by the Policy and Wisdom of our Government and the impolitick and foolish Management of the  Spaniards  who by their Religious Tyranny and their Civil Fury drove their own People over to us to seek Bread and Liberty in return for which they gave us Wealth and Trade taught our Women to Spin and our Men to Weave ever since this we have made the Manufacture our own and are now able to teach our Teachers having infinitely improv'd the Kinds as well as encreas'd the Quantity have made not only innumerable newinvented Sorts but have also made those Sorts or Kinds of Goods much better than ever the  Flemmings  were able to make them before especially the Broad Cloths which are improved to such a Degree and brought to such Perfection as they were never capable of before or so much as to believe possible  That by this very Article  England  tho' not an Inch of Land larger either in Length or Breadth the Soil not an Ounce richer than it was capable of being made before the Climate not one Degree warmer and without any one Advantage of Nature more than it had before yet by a moderate and I believe a just and reasonable Calculation between the Year in the beginning of King  Hen  VII when we began to manufacture our own Wool and the Year has encreas'd her People from under two Millions to above seven Millions  raised the Value of Lands so that what was then worth  l per Annum  is now worth  l per Annum  as may be seen by the Rate of Subsidies and by other Rules of Calculation and which has raised the Value of Personal Wealth to such a Degree as admits no Comparison no Calculation and hardly any Imagination insomuch that Some are of opinion that taking the Wealth of this Nation at the Medium of Time between the Conquest and the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  that is to say about the Reign of  Edward  II and excepting only the Wealth of Churches and Monasterys which indeed was great there is now more Silver in  England  than there was then Block Tin more Gold than they had Copper and more Diamonds and Pearl than they had  Bristol  Stones  This Increase of People and of the Real and Personal Wealth of  England  may be said to be all owing to the Woollen Manufacture and to bring it all to the Point  viz  that this Woollen Manufacture has gone on encreasing ever since even to this Time or as I may more properly say to Our time 'till its Magnitude is such that we may say it is too great and that not too great for the Country only but too great for the whole World  It is a strange Advance made in this Argument and at the beginning of it too to say the Manufacture of  England  is too great for the World but I cannot go back from it and upon a serious Reflexion on its real Magnitude as it now is and yet how much greater it is possible to make it that is to say how many Countries and as I may say Millions of People are yet unconcerned in it and unemployed by it I do insist that were the Wool of  Great Britain  and  Ireland  kept entirely at home the Quantity encreas'd as it might be and all that Quantity manufactured at home as it also might be if those other Countries were set to work the People of  Great Britain  and  Ireland  are able to make more Woollen Manufactures than all the known Inhabitants of the World would wear To such a Perfection of Working are the People arrived to such an immense Quantity is the Wool brought to amount to such a prodigious Number are the People multiplied and the last Article indeed is the most essential of all the rest for not withstanding the Encrease of the Wool which is a Prodigy in it self yet to such a Degree are the People also encreas'd that all the Wool of  England  however as I say encreas'd and all the Wool of  Ireland  from whence no Wool was had in those Days and all the Wool of  Scotland  which was not used at all in  England  in those times is now manufactured in  England  by less than one quarter part of our People  This may seem strange at first View and especially when we see how many Thousands nay how many Millions of People are employ'd in this one Manufacture But let me be allowed a short Digression and I shall soon prove it by giving you a View of the several Countries in  England  where the Woollen Manufactures are made and where  not  NB  Before I begin I must observe that when I say such Counties make no Woollen Manufactures I do not mean that many of the People might not knit their own Stockings spin and weave Woollens for their own Use and Wearing as in some Places they do Linnen where yet we do not say the Linnen is carried on as a Manufacture but it is to be understood that they make no Particular or General Manufacture for Sale and for Trade to be carried out of the Bounds of the Towns or Counties where they are so made  The County of  Cornwall  is not known to have any Manufacture  Devonshire  indeed the next County immediately on this Side is full of Manufacture but we see nothing in  Cornwall  but Miners and Diggers in the Earth for Lead Copper and Block Tin as for the poor Women they are employ'd in washing the Oar and the Men who are not at work in the Mines are Refiners Smelters and Melters of the Oar and Mettals or else are Husbandmen Fishermen and Sailers but no Woollen Manufacture  The four large Counties of  Kent Sussex Surry  and  Southampton  have very little apparent Manufacture In former times there were some Cloathings about  Guildford Godlaming Darking  and  Farnham  in  Surrey  and likewise at  Tenterden Cranbrook Goudburst  and in the  Wild  of  Kent  in both which Counties they made a very good tho' lowpriz'd Medley Cloth for the middling Peoples wear but 'tis all gone extinct except a little not worth naming  The great City of  London  is now eminent for the Woollen Manufacture of Stuffs Chamlets and several Goods such as were formerly made at  Norwich  but as this is in a manner confin'd to  SpittleFields  and a few adjacent Streets and to a very little in  Southwark  it may be truly said that not one twentieth Part of the City and County of  Middlesex  are concerned at all in it  The Inland Counties of  Bucks Hertsord Cambridge Bedford  and  Huntingdon  these have none of them any Woollen Manufactures except that of late Years the  SpittleFields  Manufacturers have employed some particular Places in  those Counties for spinning Worsted Yarn but 'tis sent up to  London  to be manufactured  Even  Lincolnshire  it self tho' it is the inexhaustible Fund of Wool for all the East and SouthEast Part of  England  and is the chief Support of their Manufacture yet has no Manufacture of its own nor do we so much as see the Women and Children employ'd or any Spinning among them tho' it is also an exceeding large and populous County but they are generally employ'd in Trade or Husbandry at home or upon the Seas abroad  The County of  Stafford  and of  Chester  and  Darby  being wholly taken up in making Cheese breeding Horses and Cows digging Lead and making Crockery Ware have very little or no Woollen Manufacture except about  Tamworth    Northumberland Cumberland Durham  and the East and North Riding of  Yorkshire  are the same and have no Woollen Manufacture except a small Quantity of Yarn Stockings made at  Richmond  and  Barnard Castle  and a ccarse strip'd Stuff for Hangings at  Darlington  All the Counties of  Wales  put together produce no Manufacture for Sale or that come out of their own bounds except Flannel with a very few and very coarse Yarn Stockings  Nor do the two large Counties of  Monmouth  and  Hereford  and two Thirds of  Shropshire  so much as pretend to any Woollen Manufacture but are taken up with planting Orchards making Syder  c  So that notwithstanding the exceeding Greatness and Extent of the Woollen Manufacture and that as I have said it seems to be too great even for the whole World yet it employs by far the least Part of  England  and even the least Part of the People in many of those Counties where it is made  Nay even in those Counties where great Branches of the Woollen Manufacture are established yet there are other Manufactures which employ greater numbers of their People For Example  The four Capital Districts where the Woollen Manufacture of  England  is seated are thus divided  The Westriding of  Yorkshire  including the Eastside of  Lancashire  the County of  Westmorland  and  Richmondshire  and Part of  Cumberland  Yet in this very Westriding is the great Iron Manufacture of  Sheffield  and the County round it which is called  Hallamshire  is said to employ at least an hundred thousand People  The West Side of  Wilts  and the whole Counties of  Gloucester Warwicksbire  and  Worcester  and part of  Shropshire  and yet in the two Counties of  Warwick  and  Worcester  are carried on the great Hardware Manufacture of Iron Brass Steel  c  at  Birmingham  and the Nailors which it is known to employ are a prodigious Number of People many more than at  Sheffield  as also the Manufacture of Glass at  Sturbridge  besides several other smaller Manufactures also of different kinds add to which the multitude of Dairies and Cheesemakers in those particular Counties  The great and populous Counties of  Devon  and  Somerset  the most intent perhaps upon the Woollen Manufacture of any in all  Britain  yet how is the first diverted by the fishing Trade upon both its Shores its Cyder Trade in the  SouthHams  and also in their Seaaffairs as well the Shipping as the Merchandize and the other in Grazing and Digging of Lead and Coal which employs many thousands of their People  The Counties of  Essex Norfolk  and  Suffolk  carry on the fourth but not the least Branch of the Woollen Manufacture and yet they tell us there are above thirty thousand Men employed out of those three Counties always at Sea  Suffolk  is two Thirds of it both Land and People employed in Dairies and feeding Cattle and Fowls for  London  and they tell us that the two Counties of  Essex  and  Suffolk  only send every Year to  London  fifty thousand Head of fat black Cattle two hundred thousand fat Sheep and Lambs fifty thousand Firkins of Butter and twenty thousand Barrels of Oysters an hundred thousand fatted Calves with two Millions of Geese and Turkeys How many of the People all That may keep employed let others judge for me However it will be granted that even in these three Counties where such prodigious Manufactures are produced as  Norwich  Stuffs the  Sudbury  Sayes and the  Colchester  Bayes yet not one half of the People are employed in any  Add to this the Multitudes of People in  Lancashire  employed in making the Cotton Manufactures about which alone they say there are two hundred thousand People employed in the Town of  Manchester  and within twelve Miles round it  Add to this also the Multitudes now employed in the same County in the Linnen Manufacture which is so encreased of late Years there as to employ near as many as the Cotton only that it extends over a greater compass of Land  Add to them all That even in those Manufacturing Counties where the greatest Part of the Woollen Work is carried on and where the most People are employed by it not the Lawyers not the Physicians not the Gentry not the Clergy not the Citizens or Townspeople that is to say not the Shopkeepers not all the Handicrafts such as Smiths Carpenters Masous Bricklayers Shoemakers and of the last not their Wives or Children so much as set a Hand no not a Finger to any Part of this great Manufacture except it be to wear it out and consume it  In a word except the Weaving part and the Managing part the main Stress of the Manufacture depends upon and is performed by the Women and Children and that of those few Counties only  The Conclusion from all this is directly to the Case proposed thus  If the Manufacture of  England  is so prodigious great and yet employs but so small a Part of the People what might it not be brought to and how would it be as I said too great for the whole World if all the Inhabitants I mean all the looser Inhabitants such as are fit to work and who would gladly work if they could be employed were set in upon it What an infinite Quantity of Goods would they make and how would they use up not only all the Wool that  England Scotland  and  Ireland  could produce but even more Wool than they could produce tho' the said Quantity was to be encreased to twice or three times as much as it is and that none was clandestinely carried away to other Parts  But as I said this Part should be treated as a Digression I will not run it out too long It comes of course next to consider the present State of this great Manufacture how it stands and then bring it all to these great and necessary Enquiries  Whether it is under a declining and sinking Condition or no  What Effect this Decay of the Manufacture may have and what it naturally tends to  What are the Occasions of its Decay and wherein it consists  What may yet be done to revive it With some other Observations which may fall in as we go  And this is the Business in the following Sheets  CHAP I Of the original State of the Woollen Manufacture of  GreatBritain  with some just Deductions from what it has been in former Times to what it is Now  AS I have observed in the Introduction that the Woollen Manufacture was like the Children of  Israel  rescued from a State of Captivity and from a strange Land we must make that out a little plainer The Case was thus  In the Reign of  Edward  III of glorious Fame tho'  England  was thought to be at that time in the most flourishing Condition that History gives us any Account of The Glory of her Arms the Vigour of the Monarch and of his eldest Son the Gaiety and Splendor of the Court were such as never were known before the Last was the Resort of all the Nobility Youth and Gentry of  Europe  the second was the Admiration and Wonder of the World the greatest Princes made their Court to them and Kings were Captives in their Possession  England  was the Terror of the World The Battles of  Cressy  and  Poictiers  and the reinstating the King of  Spain  depos'd by his Rival were Actions that brought all the Powers of  Europe  to stand at Gaze and as it were to dread the turning of the Arms of  England  so much as towards their Dominions History will confirm all the Particulars I have no room for long Quotations  Yet all this while Trade shared no Advantages among the Conquests of the Day nor do we find the least Concern in any of the Councils of that Glorious Prince or of his Ministers of State for the Propagation of Commerce at home or abroad  Building publick and sumptuous Edifices great Churches and Monasterys making Feasts Balls Tournaments adorning  Windsor  Castle instituting the famous Order of Knighthood making League and Alliances expensive Enterviews with Foreign Princes such as the Emperor and the Duke of  Burgundy  and keeping a magnificent  English  Court at  Cologne  for almost a Year and a half at a time These things took up the Court and turn'd the Eyes I had almost said turn'd the Heads of the Nation during that whole Reign Things which tended to the Glory of the Kingdom and the Honour of the Majesty of the King as  Nebuchadnezzar  said of his great  Babel  that he had built but as we may add these  glorious things gutted  England  of its Wealth made the Monarch powerful and his People poor  In all his Parliaments we see not one Act for the Encouragement of Trade for the enlarging Commerce for Employment of the Poor for setting up Manufactures to speak the Truth I question if the Word Manufacture or Manufacturer were known in the Country and for ought I see as the Taylors were the Only Merchants so the Shoemakers were the Greatest Manufacturers in the Kingdom  The bountiful Hand of Heaven had then and from the Beginning given  England  the greatest Gift of Nature that the whole World could be said to enjoy  viz  the Wool The diligent and sensible Nations round us understood it and how to value it and which was more understood how to improve it and for that end throng'd to the very outmost Bounds of the Continent of  Europe  this way to be near it and that they might bring it over as cheap as possible  By this I mean the  Netherlands  where the industrious People by the Help of the Wool from  England  fell to work in such a Manner as that there they made then as we have since done in  England  Cloaths for all the known Parts of the World  This brought the many Thousands and Millions of People to inhabit those drowned overflowed Bogs and Marshes which before that were scarce thought fit for human Creatures to dwell in and which were dwelt in only as Retreats and Fastnesses to secure the fugitive Nations from the Incursions of the  Gauls  and afterwards of the  Romans  This very Trade brought People and built Cities and Castles even where the Sea allowed no footing and the Land no Foundation from hence I say the numberless Throngs of People came to dwell in that Country and by degrees by the Encrease of their Wealth and by their indefatigable Industry all the Effects of Trade and Manufacture have brought it to be the richest Soil the fullest of People and of great Cities and Towns of any Country in the World  All this while  England  lay neglected to the last Degree her Sons knocking their Heads against Stonewalls and ranging the Field of War in foreign Countries pursued their own Poverty and sought Misery for the Glory of their Monarch  But at home it was all a Miscellany of Sorrow Villainage and Vassalage comprised the Poor Knighthood and Esquireship took up the middle Gentry and Glory dwelt only among the Barons and Princes  All the Trade we read of was carrying their Wool abroad to give Employment to the Poor of foreign Countries  viz  the  Dutch  and the  Flemings  and this Wool we may say was the grand Fund of the Wealth both of King and People  If the King made any Wars and demanded Subsidies of his Parliament as was too frequently the Case in the time of  Edw  III the grand Article of  Ways and Means  was to grant the King ten Shillings a Pack upon Wool or twenty Shillings a Pack upon Wool like our two Shillings and four Shillings  per  Pound upon Land and once they came to such a Height God forbid we should see the like of our Lands that the Parliament gave the King one Half Part of all the Wool it self for his Wars in  France  by the same Token that as King  Charles  II did too often all the Money was spent and no War with  France  begun neither nor did the War break out 'till three Years after so that when it came they were sain to give the King new Subsidies again that is to say another Tax upon the Exportation of Wool and so over and over again several times  In this State of Indolence or rather horrid Ignorance and Blindness was this whole Nation as it were Philtred and Bewitched notwithstanding all the Glory the Wisdom the Policy and good Government which King  Edward  III was so famed for  Like People buried alive in Sloth and Idleness they sat still ploughed and sowed as much Corn as served just to feed them sheer'd their Sheep every Year and as it may be said threw away their Wool went to the Wars were knocked on the Head for the Honour of  Old England  and the Glory of their great Kings and this was the Round of Life even from the Nobleman to the meanest Vassal Peasant or Labourer in the Nation  As to the poor Women and Children they sat at home fared hard lived poor and idle the Women drudg'd at the Husbandry and the Children sar still blow'd their Fingers pick'd Straws and both might be said not to live but to slarve out a wretched time then Die and go  Where  who knows  As to Manufacture or Employment we do not see room so much as to believe that they knew any thing of it any farther than it may be to make some very ordinary things which Nature  Necessity put them upon for their own Covering and hardly that  In this miserable Condition lay the Ancestry of this diligent Nation who being but once let into the Method of  working the Wool and some Authority supporting as well as encouraging them by stopping the Stream of its Exportation soon tasted the Sweets of it soon fell heartily upon it presently became Masters of the Performance and in time supplanted the Encroachers engrossed the Wool for it was their own before redeem'd the Captives and at last brought not only the Manufactures but the Manufacturers too over to  England  for thousands of the People followed the Manufacture for Bread and that they might get Employment and this began the multiplying of the People too as well as of their Wealth for as Trade brings Wealth so Work brings the Workmen together  It is just thus still in  England  Whereever we see the Manufactures seated there we see Multitudes of People collected the Labour gathers the Hands and this was the first Occasion of making those strict exclusive Laws for Parish Settlements that the particular Parishes where such Manufactures were set up might not be oppressed with the Numbers of Poor flocking in from other Parishes  Where the first Manufacturer's settled or set up the unemployed People presently throng'd about them for Business and Wages and we find it to this day that where the Manufactures are the Country is always exceeding populous This 'tis evident the Manufactures did not find but made it so 'tis true the Manufacture in most Places pitch'd its Situation in great Towns or Cities such as  Norwich Colchester Canterbury Exeter  and the like but 'tis also certain that those Cities and especially the adjacent Countries are grown infinitely more populous by the settling of those Manufactures among them than they were before  This is farther proved by a general View of those Parts of  England  where the People are not thus employed for where the Inhabitants of a Country consist only or chiefly of Landlord and Tenant Gentry and Shopkeepers you see the Country much less throng'd it is true that the Multitudes which live together in those Places where the Manufactures are established as above do influence all the rest of the Nation by causing a greater Cultivation of the Lands and greater Improvement of Estates for Provisions which the other consume the Corn and the Cattle being brought from the remotest Parts for their Subsistence and by consequence the People are encreas'd there also  Yet we see the Country is inhabited in a more even manner the People live more at large and dispersed as the Farms  and the Lands which they cultivate call them they are spread as it were over the whole sace of the Land  We see no such Villages there as  Leeds  or  Hallifax Sheffield  or  Birmingham Manchester  or  Froom Taunton  or  Troubridge  in most of which or on very little Ground near them twenty to forty thousand People are said severally to inhabit and in three or four of them as in  Hallifax Manchester Birmingham  and  Froom  many more  But to go back to the Introduction of this Change It was in the Reign of K  Hen  VII and not before when the  English  began the bold Adventure of Manufacturing their own Wool I mean began it in Quantity There had some Attempt been made before and we are told of some Adventurers in Trade who having been over in  Flanders  and learned the Manner of it but especially having seen the Advantage of it had brought over with them so much Knowledge as to learn the People to spin so many of them at least as their Stocks could compass to employ and others to Comb and Card the Wool and so on thro' all the other Parts of the Work which went a little way and was promising to go farther in time  But it is to be observed that from the first Part of the Reign of  Henry  VI and thro' all that long Reign and thro' the Reign of  Edward  IV and  Richard  III the whole Nation was miserably embroiled in the Civil Confusions such as the Wars between the White Rose and the Red the Houses of  Lancaster  and  York  and the several Insurrections and Revolutions of Affairs which naturally attended those Quarrels  Every one knows that War is no Friend to Trade Arts and Improvements much less Manufacture and the Employment of the Poor never plant or at least never thrive in the Flame and Heat of War especially too the worst of the kind an Intestine Civil or to speak justly of it an Unnatural War  Times of Feud and Faction Rebellion Insurrection killing and plundering are no times for Improvement and this may be a just Reason why the Beginnings of the Manufacture which I have mentioned as above took no considerable root during the Confusions of War both Civil and Foreign Wars but especially Civil Wars which for sixty Years almost without Intermission vex'd this Nation  Perhaps a Manufacturer did or suppose he had seated himself at any particular Town or Place in the Country had brought together some People and had instructed them in the Work  viz  some Women to spin some Men to comb to  weave to dress the Cloth and had built a Fulling Mill to thicken the Cloths and the like Then come the two Armies into the Field and they march over the Country where the poor Manufacturer is settled If it be a friendly Army and they are of the same Side then the kindest thing that could be expected was to call all the Poor Workmen away especially the young ablebodied Fellows with their Bows and Arrows to encrease the Army If it were the Enemy then they all run away for fear of being forced As for the Women and Children they are no body without the Men for they cannot spin the Wool 'till the Men comb it and when they have spun the Yarn 'tis of no use when the Men are gone that should weave it and perhaps the Loom which it should be wrought in burnt by the Plunderings and Ravagings of the Soldiers  By this means and I cannot doubt but this was often the Case the Beginning of the Manufacture was check'd and put back the poor Undertaker ruin'd and undone and so you heard no more of the Attempt for some Years  This is as good an Account as I believe can be given why the Woollen Manufacture began among us no sooner why it had no Encouragement in  England  at least no considerable Encouragement 'till the time of King  Henry  VII and about the Year to  The Reign of King  Henry  was the first  Halcyon  Season which  England  had selt not for some Years only but for some Ages as will appear at large in the Histories of those Times Either Wars abroad or Wars at home had vex'd the Nation from the unfortunate Reign of  Richard  II to that time all the Circumstances of those Reigns will confirm it I need not quote the Particulars which are too many the Nation was always in a Hurry and a Fright here the Oppressions of Tyrants there the Rebellions of People here the Kings depos'd and murther'd there the People ravag'd and plunder'd now one King runs away then another  Hen  VI was upon the Throne and in Prison alternately five or six times  Edward  IV upon the Throne and fled out of the Country twice at least and so among the rest  But  Henry  VII took new Measures and manag'd the Publick Affairs with the utmost Dexterity He first humbled the too powerful Nobility so to prevent Caballing and Rebellion brought them to be all dependent upon him and gradually impoverish'd them while he hoarded up immense Sums of Money himself In a word his Reign was a whole Scene of Intrigue and Design among the great Ones the King ever talking of War and blustering at his Neighbours as if he  would quarrel with every body and got great Sums of Money from his Parliament to begin a War especially against  France  but put the Money in his Pocket and never made any War at all and as some say never intended it  But in the mean time as these Cabals and Politicks at Court concerned no body but themselves his Reign as to the People was all pacifick and quiet and the Consequence was visible for now Industry began to hold up its Head Trade began to spread the Merchants began to set up and Navigation to be encouraged the People of  England  began to look abroad and about them and Colonies and Factories began in this very Reign to be planted foreign Countries to be discovered and new Worlds looked into and Some tell us that  Christopber Columbus  having now discovered  America  came over hither and made the first Offer for a farther Discovery to King  Henry  and particularly to take possession of it for him but that the King by the meer Narrowness of his Soul declin'd the Expence of it  Also 'tis affirm'd that several Voyages were made in this King's Reign to the Western Shoars of  Africk  and to the Gold Coast and great Advantages made by it to the Merchants bringing pure Gold back for the most worthless Trifles But this is not to the present Purpose only thus far that this being a Reign of prosound Peace Arts and Commerce began to relish with the People and they began to turn their Hands to several kinds of Improvement  Among the rest this of the Woollen Manufacture came principally into play The King who had liv'd abroad as well in  Flanders  as in  France  and  Brittany  had seen with Regret how not the  Flemings  only but the  French  grew rich at the Expence of  England  and how even they could not refrain mocking the Sloth and Weakness of the  English  that should let their Wool be carried out of the Kingdom to be work'd up into Cloths and Stuffs and in a word be manufactured abroad and then buy even the Cloths they wore of their own Wool so manufactured abroad  It must be consess'd it deserv'd Reproach and when we come to look back upon it at this distance we cannot help wondering at the Madness of the People but there are so many other Examples of the unaccountable Stupidity of those Ages especially of the common People that if they were all to be brought upon the Stage we should cease to wonder at any thing of this kind as particularly how they were blindly given up to the absolute Tyranny of the Nobility in Civil Matters and to the absolute Government of the ignorant Priests on the Side of Religion  But not to dwell upon the Folly of those Ages I proceed to take a View of the Advances our Ancestors made in the recovering this glorious Trade and even in that I shall not enlarge upon the little Beginnings and unsuccessful Attempts which as above were made by private Purses and on private Experiments before the Reign of King  Henry  VII for if we may believe  Fame  there were several private Essays made for the engaging in and carrying on a Manufacture of Woollen Cloth before that Time some of which began to promise Success too and the People began to relish the Thing and taste the Profit of it before  Had it not been so we can hardly think that King  Henry  could all at once bring the People of  England  to a general Manufacturing so as effectually to stop the Exportation of the Wool as he certainly did in the eighteenth Year of his Reign or thereabout  But several People having attempted it before some without Success and some with and the Thing beginning gradually to encrease and get ground in the Reign of  Edward  IV the King who as above having seen the innumerable Numbers of People working at it abroad and being thereby fully sensible of the Advantage it would be to his own Subjects if they could be brought to engage in it at home first set heartily about it among his own Subjects encouraging those that were engag'd in it and promising Encouragement to others to go about it so that he brought several Men of Interest among his Nobility and others to espouse it and the Manufacture was set on foot in that manner in several Parts of  England  and that with apparent Success as particularly if we may credit private Accounts the first Appearance of the Woollen Manufacture of Cloth was at  Wakefield  in the West Riding of  Yorkshire  being encouraged by an ancient Knight and Favourite of King  Henry  of the Name of  Savil  and some other Persons of Rank who had Estates in that Country and who encourag'd their Tenants and Vassals to the Work This  Savil  I suppose to be some of the Ancestors of the late Marquis of  Hallifax  one of whose Titles is taken from the Town of  Eland  in the same Part of the Country and upon the Banks of the  Calder  not far from  Wakefield  of whom the Posterity are Lords  Eland  to this Day  The next Place to which the Manufacture spread was the Town of  Okingham  in  Berkshire  where it did not continue long or at least was not contain'd in the narrow Bounds of that small Place but spread it self to the larger Towns of  Basingstoke  and  Andover  in  Hampshire  and  Wiltshire  and to  Reading  and  Newberry  in which four last Towns it continued even 'till within these few Years to an extraordinary Magnitude but it is now remov'd farther West into  Wiltshire Gloucestershire  c Then the Countess of  Richmond  Mother to King  Henry  VII encouraged some money'd Men to set it up again in the Villages about  Woking  on the River  Wey  where or near which she liv'd with a great and noble Hospitality doing good to all the poor People round about her and particularly by thus setling them to work and that from thence began the Cloathing about  Guildford Godlaming Darking  c all Towns in  Surrey  and in other Places thereabouts and which continues there tho' decay'd to this Day  It was some time after these private Persons undertook the manufacturing of Wool that King  Henry  finding his Subjects begin to improve and that the Goods they made were able to supply the ordinary Demand or near it caused the Exportation of Wool to be prohibited and foreignmade Manufactures also to be excluded encouraging his People thereby to make larger Quantities of those Goods at home  Nor did there need any greater Encouragement to the Manufacture than thus shutting out the foreign Manufactures for this encreasing the Demand at home the Price encreas'd of course which sufficiently rewarded the Labours of the Workmen and encreas'd their Wages  I need not bring any Vouchers to prove that this Encrease of Wages improved the Manufacture or encreas'd the Number of the Workmen for now not only the  English  fell into the Trade with Courage and with Multitudes but as above Multitudes follow'd the Manufacture out of  Flanders  encouraged by the Gain and wanting Employment at home  Nor were these of the labouring Poor only but abundance of the Master Manufacturers and of those the most skilful in the Workmanship by whom the People here were soon instructed and perfected in the Knowledge not of the Art only in general such as in the Sorting Combing Carding and otherwise managing the Wool in Spinning Weaving Knitting  c  but also in the several kinds of Goods fitted for the Markets and demanded as well abroad as at home  Thus the  English  secur'd the Trade to themselves and became first Masters of the Woollen Manufacture and the very  Flemings  themselves who had for so many Ages eat the Bread out of their Mouths were now their Assistants and Instructors in compleating them in the Knowledge of Dressing Sheering Perfecting and Finishing the working Part thousands of the said  Flemings  and their Families coming over  hither for Work and settling among them and whose Posterity became  English  immediately after them scarcely reserving their foreign Names or changing them to conceal their Original  For it is to be observ'd that it was not so easy a Matter for Foreigners to be naturalized among the  English  in those times as it is now which made those that found means to settle here and turn their Hands to the Manufacture take what care they could to conceal themselves and so to change their Sirnames or at least shorten and abridge them into differing Sounds that they might be made to speak  English  as much as possible that is to say to sound like  English  for Example  Jean de Somteres  would be called  John Sommers Guillaume de Tournay William Turner Esticnne D'Anvers Stephen Danvers Jaques de Franquemont James Franks  and so of the rest by which all the  Flemish Dutch  and  Walloon  Names were presently turn'd into  English  And thus of those who had two or three Christian Names as is common among Foreigners they turn'd the second Christian Name into a Sirname and from thence 'tis said we have so many Families of such Sirnames among us to this Day for Example  Jean Jaques de Buromeir  leaving out the Sirname was called  John James Guillaume Jacob Van Platten William Jacobs Guillaume Henry de Villangen William Henry  and many more of this kind as we find the  French  Refugees of the last Age are doing at this very time  Jean de Morlaix  is now  John Morley  and but the other Day  Jaques de Guilote  call'd himself  James Gill  and the like is done every Day so that the Families are no more known to be foreign But this is a Digression  We find very little upon Record relating to the Wool being carried into  Flanders  after this or of the  Flemings  making broad Cloth and Stuffs nor indeed are our Laws much concerned about those Affairs except that King  Henry  VII towards the End of his Reign had some Laws made to regulate the Lengths and Breadths of the Cloths made here in order to bring the Clothiers into a Regularity of working and that the several sorts of Goods should be all alike equal to one another and as near as possible of an equal Goodness and Value so to establish the Price of every kind at Market and prevent Frauds  Hence came the fixing of Marks and Seals to the Cloths at first every Maker striving to add a Reputation to his own Manufacture and pretending it to be superiour in its Fineness or Goodness to his Neighbours set his Mark at the End wrought into the Cloth in some different Colour or as afer some time was practis'd Leaden Seals with the Maker's  Name and the Weight of the Cloth stamp'd upon them and hence after some time the several Towns and Corporations denominating the Manufacture from the Place obtained Privileges and Immunities Powers and Authority to regulate the Length and Breadth and Goodness of the several Manufactures made in those Towns respectively stamping the Leaden Seals with the Town Marks or Arms as at  Colchester  at  Norwich  at  Leeds  and several other Places  It is true that in this Interval between stopping the Wool from being exported and bringing the Manufacture at home to a Perfection two Inconveniences happened  The King's Revenue was greatly impaired and even the Parliament were put to Difficulties for  Ways  and  Means  upon extraordinary Occasions to raise Money for the King's Business for the usual Fund for raising Money when the ordinary Subsidies Tenths and Fifteenths were not sufficient was by granting the King twenty Shillings or forty Shillings as the Publick Occasion called for it upon each Pack of Wool whereas now the Wool being detained at home the Clothiers paying no Duty upon that which they bought at home nor any Tax upon the Cloths when made the Revenue to the Crown was stopt at once and this perhaps might be the reason that notwithstanding the Prohibition in  Henry  VII's time which perhaps was temporary and so might be expir'd we find the Wool was exported again to  Flanders  in the Reign of King  Henry  VIII and in the Fourth of King  Edward  VI we find mention made of a  Wool Fleet  of sixty Sail bound to  Antwerp  which I take to be partly also occasioned by this next Article  viz  That the Clothing being yet young in  England  tho' greatly improved considering the time it had been set up in the Manufacturers were not able to work up the whole Quantity of Wool which grew in  England  and so the Government was obliged either to allow or wink at its being carried abroad as it certainly was all the Reign of  Henry  VIII and of  Edward  VI also tho' in the said fourth Year of  Ed  VI they consulted much upon erecting a Mart for the  English  Cloth and Block Tin to be establish'd at  Southampton  so that none of those Goods should be sold at any other Place for the SouthWest Parts of  England  and at  Hull  for the North Parts this last to accommodate the Merchants of the EastSeas called the  Hans  and also for the Ease and Advantage of the Northern Clothiers in  England  for that it was observed even then that the Clothing Trade flourished in those early Times in the WestRiding of  Yorkshire  viz at  Wakefield Halifax Leeds  c more than in any other Part of  England  However as I have said that the Clothiers were not yet able to work up all the Growth of the Wool in  England  so there seemed to be a Necessity to let some Part of it be sent abroad yet it was resolved in King  Edward  's Council it seems to stop the Fleet which was just then going for  Antwerp  and to have the Wool kept at home to encourage the Mart intended to be erected at  Southampton  But the Fleet was sailed out of  Dover  Harbour and out of the River of  Thames  before the Order of Council was passed and could reach them and so the Wool went away and the King's Death following soon after those Resolves came to Nothing for that time  In the next Reign  Philip  II King of  Spain  marrying Queen  Mary  of  England  it was not to be expected that a Prohibition so much to the Prejudice of the Trade of the  Netherlands  which were King  Philip  's proper Dominion should pass in  England  so that we have Reason to believe the Prohibition of sending Wool over the Seas was at least suspended for that Reign and what happen'd in the next we shall have frequent Occasion to mention as we go on  Thus you see the Infant State of the Woollen Manufacture from what rational Measures it received its first Encouragement in  England  and how gradually it came on for we must also observe that as it was a thing of vast Magnitude as well as of the utmost Importance to this Nation so it was not easily much less suddenly brought to Perfection the Stream or Channel of so great a Commerce was not soon changed tho' our People came into it with Chearfulness and made wonderful Progress for the time yet  This Rome  was not built in a Day it was many Years nay Ages before it came to Perfection  The first Beginnings of it I take to have been in the Reign of  Edward  IV that is to say of its being attempted by private Hands The first publick Countenance it receiv'd was at nearest about the Year in the time of  Henry  VII and it was from thence to the Year  viz  under Queen  Elizabeth  before it came to its Perfection so that it was above an hundred and twenty Years as we may call it in its State of  Nonage  tho' all the while encreasing and growing and in a promising View of a prosperous Magnitude the same which we have since seen it arrive to  It had indeed a most glorious Patron or Patroness and Protector in Queen  Elizabeth  who not only promoted and encouraged it at home but also extended the Trade for the Consumption of it abroad for in her Time the several Branches of the  English  Commerce were extended into almost all Parts of the known World the  Turkey  Trade and the  Muscovy  Trade established the Colonies in  America  discovered and planted by all which the Woollen Manufacture obtained a Vent in foreign Markets and those great Branches of its Consumption which have since been so large and are still the most considerable were first established in her time particularly I say that of  Turkey  and  Muscovy  But nothing contributed so effectually to the Prosperity of the Woollen Manufacture in this Nation and which may be said under the wise Conduct of that glorious Queen to compleat the whole Fabrick giving the mortal Stroke to unhinging the whole Trade in and shutting it for ever out from the  LowCountries  as the long and bloody War between the King of  Spain  and his Subjects in those Countries on account of the Liberties and Religion of the People  By this the People were distracted and separated the Nobility murthered the Towns ruin'd the Country plunder'd the United Provinces now call'd the  StatesGeneral  entirely broken off from the King of  Spain  's Government thousands of the People fled over to  England  where they were kindly received hospitably relieved courteously entertained and which was above all the rest encouraged to set up their Manufactures in the Towns and Corporations wherever they pleas'd and this encreas'd and compleated the manufacturing Trade in  England  And thus we have brought it within View at least of its present State  CHAP II Of the Flourishing Circumstances of the  English  Manufactures in the Ages past both Abroad and at Home with a summary Account of its Gradations  IT was not to be reckon'd a small Part of the Encrease of the Woollen Manufacture in  England  considering its Original was from Abroad that it was made capable of supplying the Demands of the Home Trade and was considerable enough to cloath its own People Nor was it under above an hundred Years Improvement from its beginning that this could be attained to as is Noted above  The Manufacturers abroad not only outwork'd us but underwork'd us they made their Goods both better and cheaper the  English  had great Advantages but no Experience so  that still some of the nicer and better Manufactures were made in  Flanders  and  Holland  nor was there any avoiding it at first  But when the  Flemings  persecuted and terrified by the Cruelty and Persecution of the Duke  D'Alva  fled over hither and Queen  Elizabeth  gave them Protection and Encouragement here the  English  then became absolute Masters of the Manufactures and from thence we may Date the Perfection of their Skill then all foreign Importation might be said to cease and the carrying abroad of the Wool was made Criminal  But let us see how its Consumption went on  At Home the whole Country was cloathed Poor and Rich nothing so fine but it was to be had in  Gloucestershire  and  Wiltshire Worcestershire  and  Barkshire Jack  of  Newbury  was a Clothier superior to any that are to be found among us at this Time by many Thousands as Money went then and Mr  Kenrick  's Will of St  Christopher  's who was originally a Clothier and then a Cloth Merchant dealing to  Dort  testifies how considerable the Trade was by that Time  viz  King  James  when he left above  l  in Gifts and Charities besides the Bulk of his Estate  But let us also take a View of its Encrease Abroad from Queen  Elizabeth  's Time besides its being able fully to supply all the People at Home  That Queen established a flourishing Company called the  Levant  Merchants the same we now call the  Turkey  Company by which she extended the Trade of the  English  for their fine Broad Cloths into the several Courts of  Persia Turkey  and  Egypt  for either the Queen or the  Turkey  Company I am not sure which making some Presents to the Grand Seignior of fine  English  Cloth of such exquisite Workmanship for the Fineness of the Cloth and of such beautiful Colours being dyed Scarlet and Crimson the said Grand Seignior and the Grand Vizier caused fine Robes or Gowns to be made of the said Cloths and also fine Vests after their manner which being surred with Sables and rich Furrs presented them much about the same time from the Great Duke so the  Russian  Emperor was then call'd of  Muscovy  made a most magnificent Appearance the Grand Seignior and his Courtiers were so pleased with them that they soon became the Mode or Wear of all the great Officers and of the Grand Seignior himself and so again of the Viziers or Viceroys of their remotest Provinces and the same at the Court of  Persia  Thus in a few Years the fine  English  Cloth became the Robes of Majesty and as it were the Badge of Greatness and Glory at  Constantinople  and at  Ispahan  at  Alexandria  in  Egypt  and at  Aleppo  in  Asia  and every where else among the  Mahometans  where they had Money sufficient to purchase them and thus it continues to this Day which is still more strange than all the rest  The same  Levant  Company included the Trade to  Alexandria  in the Mouth of the great River  Nile  by which all the Country of  Egypt  was supplyed and not only the great Court of the V  zier of  Grand Cairo  who tho' a Subject or Slave of the Grand Seignior yet keeps a Court almost as great and as magnificent as the Emperor his Master but also the same C  oths were convoyed to  Suez  a SeaPort of the  Turks  in the  Red Sea  and thence by Water to  Judde  or  Ieddo  the Sea Port to the City of  Medina  the great Center of the  Mahometan  Superstition where the Riches and Magnificence of their Priests is not to be describ'd and where they are still cloath'd in the same manner especially on their Days of Ceremony  The same  Levant  Company extended the Trade for  English  Cloth to the City of  Venice  at the bottom of the  Adriatick  Gulph where they drove a very great and advantagious Trade for I suppose that the Trade of  Smyrna  and  Scanderoon  and the Caravans by  Aleppo  to  Persia  were not at that time found out by the  English  but were carried on if at all by the Merchants of  Venice  who at that time engross'd indeed all the Commerce of the East imported the Spices and all the rich Goods of the  Indies  by the Gulph of  Persia  and by the Caravans of  Bassora  and  Bagdat  to  Aleppo  and sent back by the same Conveyance such  European  Goods as those Countries demanded among which the fine Broad Cloths of  England  soon after that time began to be the most acceptable and were indeed of the greatest Value of any thing of that kind in the World  Likewise in this Queen's Reign the Passage to  ArchAngel  or the  White Sea  being discovered the  English  Merchants found Means to carry on a Trade from that Port by WaterCarriage to the great City of  Muscow  a little way excepted where their Goods were carried by Land about sixty Miles only  Here they also found a Market for their rich Cloths in the great Duke's Court and upon this a new Society for Commerce was erected and were call'd the  Muscovy  Company who brought back a very gainful Return in Sables Ermins and other rich Furrs the Produce of the wild and barren Desarts of  Siberia  and the North  NB  These  Muscovy  Merchants found the Way some time after this to pass by the great River  Wolga  to  Astracan  and thence into the  Caspian Sea  an Inland Navigation    reckoning from  Jerowslaw  where they first embarked their Goods    of very near    Miles on one River  viz  the  Wolga  hence    unwearted in their Search after new Worlds of  Trade  they pass'd the  Caspian  landed in  Gerogia  pass'd over the Mountains of  Armenia  and reach'd into the Heart of the Kingdom of  Persia  where they found an extraordinary Reception sold their fine Cloths at an extravagant Price such as was even surprizing to themselves and brought back Bales of raw Silk to a very great Advantage also so that notwithstanding the extraordinary Charges of so exceeding long a Travel they made a very profitable Voyage  These two new Trades gave a very great Encouragement to the  English  Merchants and particularly to the Manufacture of  English  Cloth which now obtain'd such a Reputation over the whole Trading World that nothing was equally valuable in any or perhaps in all the Courts of  Europe  and  Asia  In the latter End of this Queen's Reign the same Manufactures were demanded in an exceeding manner in the Northern Parts of the Empire and the Countries bordering on the  Baltick  and this Trade naturally fell into the Hands of the  Hans  that is to say the Society of Merchants who call'd themselves the  Hans  a Word signifying a  Brotherhood  or an  United Company  and because there were so many for there was once no less than Seventy two Cities of them they were called the  Hans  Towns these carried on the Trade of the North as the  Venetians  did that of the South and East mentioned above  By these Towns the  English  Manufacture was indeed wonderfully extended that is to say into all the Countries in the  Baltick  the Kingdoms of  Denmark  and  Norway  the Coasts of  Mecklemberg  both the  Pomerens Prussia Courland Livonia Easthonia  c and up the great Rivers of those Countries into the very Heart of the Empire and of all the Northern Countries for Example  By the City of  Bremen  one of the chief of the  Hans  Towns the  English  Manufacture passed up the  Weser  into all the Circle of  Westphalia  into the Countries of  Lunenberg Hessia  and some part of the  Lower Saxony  By the City of  Hamburgh  another of the  Hans  Towns they had the like Passage into the Heart of the Dominions of the Empire and even to the Hereditary Countries of the House of  Austria  for the  Elb  carries its Navigation by it self and other Navigable Rivers into and thro' the Electorates of  Saxony  and  Brandeburgh  up to the great City of  Prague  the Capital of  Bohemia  By the City of  Lubeck  the Capital and first of the  Hans  Towns to all the Kingdom of  Sweden  that City having at that time the Possession and Government of all  Schonen  and the whole Commerce of the Kingdom of  Sweden  whose Power in Shipping was at that time very low and the  Hans  were Masters of the Sea in all that Part of the World  By the City of  Stetin  another  Hans  Town situate on the great River  Oder  and by which the  Stetiners  carried on the like Trade into  Silesia Lusatia Austria  and into  Poland  By the City of  Dantzick  another  Hans  and by the Trade of that City upon the great River  Vistula  the  English  Manufactures were spread into the Heart of  Poland  and even to the Frontiers of  Hungaria  By all the SeaPorts of  Koningsburg Riga Revel  and  Narva  and the several Rivers call'd the  Duina  the  Nicmen  the  Pregel  and the  Narve  by all which the  English  Merchants found an exceeding Vent for the Consumption of the  English  Cloths especially the Northern Cloathing of  Leeds Wakefield  and  Halifax  call'd in general  Yorkshire  Cloth which being not so fine or dyed in such costly Colours as that which was sold into  Persia Muscovy  and the  Levant  yet suiting best with those Northern Climates the Merchants found the Quantities which sold there exceeding great and the Price sold for very encouraging    France  and  Spain  also tho' the last was generally embroil'd with  England  almost all that Reign were yet during the rising Prosperity of the  English  Manufacture glad to come into the Trade of it and especially the Former took off great Quantities every Year for  France  had not yet set their Hands to work to imitate much less to rival the  English  in this particular Piece of Improvement As for the  Spaniards  the Peace or Truce between  Spain  and the  StatesGeneral  which was first settled for twelve Years only by which the  Spaniards  were obliged to acknowledge the  Dutch  or  United Provinces  to be a Free State as it brought on with it a Peace or a good Correspondence at least between  England  and  Spain  so it wonderfully encreas'd the  British  Commerce  and especially the Consumption of the  English  Manufactures in all the Provinces of  Europe  where they had been obstructed if not prohibited before  Particularly the  Dutch  by the Navigation of the  Rhine  and the  Maes  two great Rivers and one of them without Comparison the greatest River for Trade and Inland Navigation in  Europe  carried those Goods up into the middle of the Southern Countries of the Empire for now the  English  Woollen Cloth was become the general Favourite of  Europe  and the Manufactures of  England  were the chief Article at the great Fairs of  Ausburg Nuremberg Francksort  and  Leipsick  the greatest Marts of  Europe  at that time if not in the World and which continue in a flourishing Condition to this Day tho' sensibly declining in that particular Article which was their first Rise and Foundation I mean that of the  English  Woollen Manufacture as I shall sh  w in its Place  By this means the  English  Manufacture which the  Dutch  at that time gladly promoted extended it self not only into the several Countries adjoining to those Rivers but into other Countries by the additional Help of other Navigable Rivers running into them or running thro' other Provinces not far from them such as  The  Moselle  falling into the  Rhine  at  Coblents  and taking into it the  Saar  by which the Trade was supplyed into  Lorrain  the Country of  Tryer  the NorthEast Parts of  France  the three Bishopricks of  Metz Toul  and  Verdun  and into all that rich and fruitful Country between the  Saar  and the  Rhine  The  Main  a River Navigable almost Miles into the Circle of  Franconia  and to the Countries of  Wurtzburgh Bamberg Baden  and many other of the most populous Parts of  Germany  passing then by  Francfort au Main  and falling into the  Rhine  at  Mentz  The  Neckar  a Navigable River also running thro' the fruitful rich Country of the Count  Palatine  of the  Rhine  and passing by the Cities of  Heidleberg Hailbron  and the Mountains of the Black Forest and within a few Miles of the City of  Ulm  upon the  Danube  where that great River begins to be Navigable and by which the said Trade had a Communication with all the great Cities and Rivers of  Suabia  and  Bavaria  and even down to  Passau Lintz  and  Vienna  The  Aar  a large River of  Swisserland  also Navigable which rising out of the same Mountains of the  Grisons  from whence the  Rhine  it self proceeded passes thro' the City of  Bern  near that of  Zurick  and other considerable Parts of  the  Swiss  Cantons and falling into the  Rbine  a little above  Basle  carryed the  English  Woollen Manufacture into the Cantons of  Swisserland  as it does now serve to our great Mortification to bring the like Manufactures now made in  Swisserland  down into  Germany  and to the great Fairs of  Nuremberg  and  Francksort  where they Undersell and Supplant us as shall be seen in its Place  In this flourishing Condition Queen  Elizabeth  left the Woollen Manufacture of  England  being at that time not the greatest Manufacture in  Europe  only for so it may be called still tho' sinking and declining apace but the most encreasing thriving and rising Trade at that time in the World  As the Woollen Manufacture had thus been about an hundred and fifty Years in its growing and encreasing Condition like a young Oak in the Woods so now being grown Major or as we say  of Age  and out of its  Nonage  we may allow it to have continued above another Century in its flourishing and prosperous State that is to say it held its own and continued in its full Glory extended to an infinite Length and Breadth triumphing over the whole World of Commerce not rival'd not imitated I will not say not envyed but really not rival'd by any People or in any Country in the World no not so much as pretended to be rival'd any where And this last hundred Years which I reckon to be the State of its full Glory and Perfection I take to be from the Middle of Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign to the End of the Reign of King  Charles  II that is to say near the End of it  viz  from the Year twenty Years before Queen  Elizabeth  died to the Year being the latter End of the Reign of King  Charles  II  During this time the Manufactures were so far from receiving any Blow any mortal Wound or sensible Disaster either from abroad or at home that the several Circumstances relating to the Vent and Consumption of them concurred to enlarge them and render their Condition yet more flourishing and prosperous if that could be than they were before For Example  First  During that Interval of Time many flourishing and now famous Colonies of  English  had been settled in  America  and in other remote Parts of the World the Discoveries of the indefatigable Adventurers of that Age such as Sir  Francis Drake  Sir  Walter Raleigh  the famous Earl of  Cumberland  Captain  Smith  and others too many to name by whom the Commerce of the  English  was extended in a prodigious manner and their Dominions also as in the following Countries in particular    Virginia    Barbadoes    New Egland    Bermudas    Newfoundland    Nevis    Hudson'sBay    Antegoa    NewYork    Montserrat    NewJersey  St  Christopher's    Pensilvania    Jamaica  c    Carolina     In all these the succeeding Generations have so improved the Plantations have been so spread so well managed and the Numbers of People are so surprisingly encreased that whereas in the Beginning of King  James  's Reign it is creditably affirmed there were not Five thousand People in all of them Negroes excepted and not abundance of Them 'Tis now as creditably insisted upon that there are not less than a Million of  British  Subjects Slaves included which monstrous Encrease is not only an Addition to the Greatness and Glory of the  British  Dominion and to their Commerce by the immense Return of their Product to  England  such as from the Continent in Tobacco Rice Pitch Tar Turpentine TrainOil Fish Whalefins Furs Drugs  c  and to the other Colonies on the Islands in Corn Meal Peas Pork Beer Horses  c  and from the Islands to  England  in Sugar Rum Melasses Ginger Cotton Indico Piemento Cocoa and many other valuable things I say this Encrease of People is not only an Encrease of Commerce in the Returns abovenamed but it adds to the Consumption of the  British  Manufactures in an extraordinary manner not only all that Million of People being to be cloathed from hence but that they have in all Places upon the said Continent taught the Natives of the Country to go cloathed also and who are supplyed with Manufactures from  England  all which is a meer Addition to the Trade as well as to the Navigation of  England  since the time abovenamed nothing of those Countries being then known much less any Trade to them  It may be objected and has been pretended that the first Planters or Inhabitants of those Colonies coming from  England  is no Addition for that the same Encrease would have been from them at home if they had not gone abroad  But as this requires a long and full Answer such a full Answer may be given to it hereafter and particularly this that those Inhabitants generally going over thither in mean Circumstances and growing rich there by their Industry have quite altered the Case and that the Encrease of the same People if it had happened had probably been an Encrease  both of unprofitable Hands and Mouths whereas here they have been just the contrary and their Posterity being rich and industrious have thereby encreased the publick Wealth as well as the Numbers of People But this is not to the present Purpose  It is certain that since Queen  Elizabeth  's time not our Colonies only but the whole Kingdom of  England  is encreased in People in a wonderful manner and that notwithstanding the prodigious Numbers who we can account for as destroyed out of the ordinary course of Nature such as by War abroad and at home Plague Shipwreck peopling of  Ireland  and other Cases by which some Millions may have been destroyed and no doubt have been  All this Encrease of People has been an Addition to the Consumption of the Manufactures and consequently an Encrease of it and to say that the Manufacture was encreased by its being sufficient to clothe the Inhabitants in  Edward  the Sixth's Reign was to say little or nothing compared to what the Importance of the same Article would be now seeing we cannot doubt but that there are at least Four Millions of People in the Kingdom of  England  at this time more than there were at the End of the Year  The first Foundation of this Encrease was without doubt said in the fixing the Manufactures at home which were before settled in  Flanders  as I have said and the next Step was the Persecution of the  Spaniards  in  Flanders  mentioned also above  The last of those Articles as some are of Opinion brought over at least one hundred thousand  Flemings  into  England  where Queen  Elizabeth  far from being ignorant of the Benefit that Numbers of People would be to her Dominions where she knew well there was Business enough to employ them gave them all imaginable Encouragement appointed them Churches admitted them to set up in Corporations exempted them from Taxes and the like and we see their Posterity here to this Day distinguished by Name in many of our Manufacturing Towns as the  Rebows  at  Colchester  the  De Vinks  at  Norwich  the  Papilons  at  Canterbury  and the like  I might give Examples of the casual Encrease of the  English  Manufactures both abroad and at home within the Compass of an hundred and twenty Years now passed from the Death of Queen  Elizabeth  as limited above to this time all which may serve further to prove the then flourishing Condition of that Trade such as the several Factories of  the  English  in other Parts of the World and the Encrease of the  Spanish  and  Portugueze  Colonies in  America  which have still added to the Encrease of the Manufactures of  GreatBritain  the Consumption being so very great among those Nations  Hitherto then we have seen the bright Side of the Subject and have brought the Manufacture to its Meridian Height It is only to be observed as an Addition to what has been said that as the Consumption of the Manufacture encreased abroad so the Quantity made encreased at home The Manufactures encreasing the Manufacturers encreased also the Trade spread at home in Proportion as it spread abroad and that which was at first the Work of a few Counties and Cities became now the Employment of whole Provinces or Divisions of the Country being a kind of District consisting of several Counties or Parts of Counties together  Thus the Manufacture first erected at  Norwich  spread in a little after the said time over the whole Counties of  Norfolk  and  Suffolk  As the Bay Trade of  Colchester  first confined to that Town and the adjacent Country is now extended thro' the whole County one of the largest and most populous in  England  The Clothing Trade erected first at the Towns of  Oakingham Reading Newbery  and  Andover  in the Countries of  Wiltshire  and  Berkshire  is now spread farther into  Wiltshire  and  Somersetshire  extending along a vast Tract of Ground from the Edge of  Gloucestershire  to the side of  Dorsetshire  for near an hundred Miles thro' the richest and most fruitful Vale in all the West Part of  England  called  the Vale of WhiteHorse  and including the populous Towns of  Malmsbury  Tedbury  Cirencester  Stroud  Marshfield  Caln  Chipenham  Devizes  Bradford  Trowbridge  Froom  Warminster  Westbury  And many more with innumerable populous Villages  The like in the Clothing of  Worcestershire  extended into the Counties of  Salop Hereford Gloucester  and the Counties adjacent  Thus I say the Manufacture flourishing abroad spread in Proportion at home 'till at length it arrived  the Magnitude which we see it in at this time when its Body is said to be too big for its Legs and the Multitudes employed in it are  such that at the same time that the Markets are decayed abroad the Extent of it not being limited at home the Laws of Proportion have been broken and tho' the Sale has been lessen'd the People have still gone on making 'till according to some the Quantity has been superior to what the whole World could or at least in the ordinary Course of Trade would consume And this brings us to the present State of the Manufacture as it stands aborad just now with respect to the Sale and as it stands at home with respect to the Production by which it will be easily seen whether the Manufacture as a Trade or as a Business is in a thriving or a declining Condition  CHAP III Of the Present State of the  British  Manufacture as well abroad as at home with a just Deduction from the Prospect of it to the Question in hand  viz  Whether it is in a Declining Condition or no  WE have seen something of the past State of the Woollen Manufacture Queen  Elizabeth  brought it into a flourishing Condition in which it continued with several large Additions to its Prosperity and a continual Encrease of its Magnitude and of its Consumption to the Time of the late Restoration in which time if it sunk in one Article it rose in another so that we might say it was always flourishing and was rather greater than less at the end of the next hundred Years than at the beginning that is to say at the Year than at the Year when Queen  Elizabeth  died  Certain it is that the Consumption was infinitely encreas'd the Trade abroad perfectly good Experience as well as History confirms that even in the Height of the Confusions of the Civil Wars in  England  the Trade of the Woollen Manufacture was flourishing and prodigious great Even during the Time of the Siege of  Colchester  when that Town was as it was called then in open Rebellion the Necessity of Trade obliged the Besiegers to give the TownsPeople Leave to bring out their Bays to  Lexden  Heath and to sell them to the  London  Merchants who came thither to buy and the Sellers were allowed to carry back their Money unmolested by  the Soldiers who besieged them The Reason was plain the Demand from abroad made it necessary the Merchants should be supplyed and the Trade ought not to be obstructed  Nay such was the Consumption of the Woollen Manufacture abroad that all the Encrease of it at home was not sufficient but the  Irish  encourag'd by the Merchants and having Plenty of Wool feel into the Making Part and in a few Years Peace being restor'd in that Kingdom and the  English  Inhabitants multiplying the Woollen Manufacture came by the Industry of People to be as great there in Proportion as it was here  France  about this time encreas'd in People and flourishing in Peace under the prosperous Reign of  Lewis  XIII and the exquisite Administration of the great  Richlieu  began to extend their Trade and the Demand they made of our Manufacture in that Reign was prodigious great  But here we must make a full Point and look a little into the Trade as in a State of full Perfection and standing for some time at a Stay  That  Great Britain  grew immensly Rich in those Ages of Trade is not to be deny'd or indeed disputed we might give a long Account of the Encrease of her Wealth and Riches her Greatness and Glory and how it was all rais'd by and the Effect of her encreas'd Commerce but it is too long for a Tract of this Nature it will be seen in its Consequences and in nothing more than in the prodigions Efforts made by the whole Nation in the late double War from the  Revolution  to the Peace of  Utrecht  in which let but the immense Sums of Money which were rais'd upon Trade only be taken Account of and they will give us a fair Sketch of the Improvement it self  Nay let the vast Sums rais'd Annually to this Day by the Customs upon Trade speak something of the Encrease of it since those Days I need not enter into the Detail of those Productions such as the Duties on Wines Tobacco Brandies  EastIndia  and  Italian  and  Turkey  Importations the Excises on Beer Ale Malt Spirits Coffee Tea  c  which at this time raise such Sums as no Nation in the World can show the like of and as this Nation never came up to before  I shall close the Abstract of it with this short Return of the late King  Lewis  XIV to the Account of the last Year's State of the War in  England  when he saw the Establishment of the  SouthSea  Company and the Provision made by the Parliament for the old unprovidedfor Debts and for the Service of the growing  Year both which amounted to near Eleven Millions  Sterling  a Sum so frightful put into  French  Money that the King upon sight of it spread out his Hands and said  I see  'tis time  to put an End to the War I never believ'd that  England  could have made such Efforts as these let us make Peace upon the best Terms we can  But I come in the next Place to the declining Part of our Trade and to enquire where it began  CHAP IV How and when the  British  Manufactures began to receive some Impression from the Influence of other Nations And how they began to suffer any Lessening or Loss from those Impressions  THE first Impression which the  British  Commerce felt upon the Greatness of her Trade and especially upon her Manufacture was from  Ireland  It was in the latter end of the Reign of King  Charles  II that  England  driving such an encouraging Commerce in the Export of her Woollen Manufactures the Gain of it animated the  Irish  Merchants not only to Export the like from  Ireland  but to encourage the People of  Ireland  as well the  Natives  as the  English Irish  so they call the Families risen up there from the  English  Race to push into it and to set up the Working all manner of Woollen Goods made in  England  after the same Manner and under the same Denominations as in  England  with this Addition that they soon found themselves able not only to do it as well as in  England  the Wool and the Workmanship being as it were the same but that they were able to Make Finish Export and consequently Sell at Market the same Goods as good and much cheaper than the  English  The first Discovery of this in  England  seem'd to be from  France  and from  Spain  where our Merchants to their great Mortification first sound themselves undersold in the Markets Goods of the same Fabrick of the like Weight Goodness Value and Colour being afforded much cheaper than from  England  This was an Affliction in Trade and a very great Disappointment to the Merchants and in its Turn to the Factors  and to the Manufacturers in the Country for  First  Our Goods at the several Markets in  France  lay unsold expected Orders were stop'd and interrupted the Merchants in  France  wrote to  Ireland  for the Goods the Markets were supplyed and our Trade in a word decay'd  It was not long so here but we began to find the same in  Portugal  and at  Cadiz  in  Spain  and at other Markets as at  Leghorn Messina  and the principal Ports of  Italy  and thus it was going on to be in all other Parts of the World  But this was not all Misfortunes seldom come alone one Evil generally follows in the Neck of another About this time Monsieur  Colbert  that great and successful Manager of the  French  Commerce after having with a most happy and wonderful Advantage put all the Southern Provinces of  France  upon the planting Mulberry Trees and raising of Silk obliging every Town and Village in the great Provinces of  Languedock Provence Dauphine  and the adjacent Countries to plant a proportion'd Number of Mulberry Trees for the nourishing Silkworms and by that means to establish a Fund for the Silk he contrived the like as far as in him lay for the Wool  But finding it impossible to form a Production of Wool in  France  tho' he got over Sheep from  England  from  Ireland  and from  Scotland  and that he could not make the Wools come on or grow there as they did at home he then apply'd himself to the settling Methods for getting Wool from  England  and especially from  Ireland  by This he immediately set up large Manufactures in  France  as at  Rouen  at  Caen  in  Poictou Guienne Nismes  and other Places too many to enumerate with this and the  Spanish  Wool and such other Supplies as he got from remoter Places he soon advanced in his new Attempt and made several sorts of Woollen Manufactures and this in such Quantities and so well performed that we saw  France  in a few Years able to supply themselves with Cloathing of their own Making tho' not of their own Wool and even to transport the Manufactures they wrought to other Places where they were sold in the same Markets with the  English  to our great Mortification as well as Loss  Nor was this all but so far the  French  proceeded that in a few Years they set up for Prohibitions excluded our Merchandizes all over  France  and pretended to shut us out from their Markets so that we should not be allow'd to Import our Goods any more into  France  This was a terrible Blow to  England  and had we not soon after made our selves Amends upon  France  by Prohibiting their whole Commerce with us particularly their Wines Brandies Linnen and wrought Silks four Articles in which it was said we took near two Millions  Sterling  from them  per Annum  more than all the Goods that they took from us amounted to I say had we not done this it must have ruin'd our whole Stock by draining away such immense Sums in Cash as must have been call'd off for the Ballance  Here began the Breach between  England  and  France  in Point of Commerce and as it came with a War it lasted so long that it is not yet return'd nor is ever likely to be The Humour of the  English  ran off from the  French  Trade neither their Wines or their Brandies or their wrought Silks have ever come into Use again here and perhaps would never do so again tho' the Trade were to be open'd at least it would not as it did before Our Taste is chang'd as to their Wines our Fashions and Modes are chang'd as to their Silks and the whole Vein of their Trade is turn'd here in  England  so as never to return into the old Channel again no tho' the Trade should be laid open which yet it is not  But still this was a Blow to our Manufactures and lessen'd the Consumption of them abroad and consequently the Exportation of them at home the Effect of which was that unless some new Vent of the said Manufactures was found out abroad there would of necessity be a Stop and some Hands must be taken off at home the Quantity must abate as the Consumption abated or else the Markets abroad would be glutted with Goods and the Makers at home not be able to put them off these must leave off making or be undone and if they left off Making the Poor at least so far would be undone for all Abatement or Declining of the Manufacture is a degree of Ruin to the People  To remedy this Prudent Heads found out one immediate Help tho' it was in its kind what we may call a Desperate Cure namely a Cure by Amputation it was indeed cutting off a Member a vast and important Member of our Manufacture  viz Ireland  The Case was thus  It was found that  Ireland  began to encroach in a very dangerous manner on our Manufacture by running into every Branch of it making every sort of Goods there which the  English  made at home and that in so great a Quantity that they not only supplyed their own Nation and sent over great Quantities hither but that  as before  they fill'd foreign Markets with them and even undersold us abroad  Upon this and considering the Abatement of the Consumption by Prohibitions abroad two Acts were passed in  England  for the Encouragement of the  English  Manufactures  An Act to take off the Duty of Tonnage and Poundage paid here upon the Exportation of the Woollen Manufacture which being about  per Cent  upon the Value was considerable and was done in order to bring down our Manufactures at foreign Markets so as not to be undersold by the  French  or  Dutch  which Act continues in Force and all our Manufactures are Exported free to this Day  An Act to Prohibit the  Irish  Woollen Manufactures being Exported to any Parts or Places beyond the Seas This was indeed a terrible Blow to the  Irish  Merchants and to the Manufacturers in that Kingdom but there was no Remedy it was apparent that if the  Irish  were suffered to go on they would reduce the Manufacture of  England  to nothing as well by their Cheapness as by their irregular Working being bound to no Laws or Rules to no Lengths or Breadths or other such Limitations as the  English  are bound by  It is not my Business not have I Room here to enter into the Reasons or Arguments made use of on one Side or other at that time 'tis enough to my present Purpose that so it was and that  England  found her self under a Necessity of taking that Step with  Ireland  however Hard or Severe it might seem to be  Nor can I enter into an Account of the Linnen Trade established on this Occasion in  Ireland  by the  English  with the several Encouragements given to it in the late King  William  's Reign being as a kind of Equivalent to the  Irish  for the heavy Article above and which is since that grown up to an unexpected Height there and by particular Encouragements in  England  is become much more of an Equivalent than was even at first hoped for but that is not our present Enquiry I return to the Case before me  This Stop of the Exportation of the Woollen Manufacture in  Ireland  was a sensible Relief to the  English  Trade and for a while the Manufactures flourish'd again and tho' the  French  encroach'd in a surprizing manner upon us in some foreign Markets yet there were some particular Articles which encreas'd our Consumption too very considerably and these ought to be mention'd because I must do Justice as I go and let it be fairly seen where our Manufacture found some Helps as well as where it felt its Decay where it was reliev'd as well as where it was wounded and hurt  Besides this violent Step for the Relief of the Manufacture it had had three Additions or Encreases in the ordinary way of Commerce which were exceeding great and which in their Turn greatly encouraged the People and supported the Thing as a Manufacture or Employment  The Trade to  Portugal  the Encrease of which has been so surprizing great and began to be so about the beginning of the first War that it was apparent in the Second War the Export of  British  Manufactures to  Portugal  from  England  was greater than the whole Export to  Portugal  and  Spain  together was before  The Trade to  Muscovy  which by the Conquests of the late  Czar  in the  Baltick  his building the Port of  Petersburgh  his altering the Habits and Cloaths of all his People and several other Encouragements given by him to Trade in General and to the  English  Commerce in Particular opened a new Door to the Consumption of the  British  Manufacture where there was none before  The extraordinary Trade to  Jamaica  By what Ways and Means our Merchants found it practicable to establish such a Commerce it is not my Business to describe but this is certain that during that War our Trade to  Jamaica  was such that the Number of Ships using that Trade was encreased to more than four times what they were in a few Years before the War and that this Trade has continued to this time or 'till within a very little while  viz  'till the  Spanish Guard de Costa's  or cruising Ships of War took upon them to keep a better Lockout than formerly and interrupt it Whether this Trade was justifiable by the Terms of the Treaties subsisting between  GreatBritain  and  Spain  or not is not to the purpose in this Place I may perhaps grant it was not But 'tis the Fact not the Legality of it that I am now Enquiring about and in that Part I am sure of being right  These three Articles of Commerce may be allowed to make a great Addition to the Consumption of the Woollen Manufacture of  England  and by these Helps the Loss of the  French  Trade was for some Years the less felt if perhaps at all  And that I may give a full Latitude to this Part of our Discourse I may add for the take of the Argument only that several other Branches of our Exportation seemed to have been encreased in the same Space  viz  the last thirty or forty Years and that not in a trifling manner but very considerably particularly to  Legborn  the Trade of that Port being exceedingly advanced during the various Turns among the neighbouring  Powers and particularly occasioned by the late Convulsions in  Spain Naples Sicily  and that were in  Piemont  and  Milan  and other Parts of  Lombardy  also by some Improvements among the  Italians  which we are not particularly Judges of Be it which way it will 'tis evident the Exportations of  British  Manufactures to  Leghorn  are more than double to what they formerly were  I might instance like wise in the End case of our own Colonies which is very considerable in the last thirty or forty Years as may be proved in many particular Circumstances in their Trade and especially by the Export of  British  Manufactures thither which is the Point I am upon and which is manifestly encreased as well to  New England  and to  Virginia  as to  Carolina  in particular and to other Places  But I need not enlarge upon these things for were the Encrease of these foreign Consumptions much greater than it is and were the Places where that Encrease has been five times larger than they are the declining State of the Manufacture would still be made out from other opposite Circumstances too evident to be denied and too strong to be balanced by those Advances  First  the unreasonable Encrease of the Quantity made is to be consider'd the growing Condition of the Manufacture it self in which we may venture to say there are some Circumstances that not only will not be equall'd by any Addition of Commerce either abroad or at home but to speak boldly to it would not be equall'd if all the Nations to whom our Manufacture is exported were to encrease the Consumption of it in proportion to that of  Portugal  or  Legborn  as above  It is evident our Manufacture is encreased to a Degree almost inexplicable insomuch that it is in itself too great for the Consumption of all  Europe  Now it seems a little of a Paradox that I should bring the Encrease of the Quantity as an Argument to prove the declining of the Manufacture that is encreased But a little Reflection will set that Part to rights in your Thoughts and the Difficulty will immediately vanish  In speaking of the Manufactures as Declined we are not speaking of the Quantity made but of the Quantity sold or it you will we must change the Terms and distinguish betwixt the Woollen Manufacture as a Work or Fabricature and as a Trade There may be as many G  ods made in  England  as ever but if there are not as many told as ever the Trade will be allowed to decline nay the more there is made the more  the Manufacture is declined if they cannot be sold because the Quantity becomes a Grievance to it self  If it be apparent that the Quantity made encreases faster than the Quantity sold off or that there is more made than can be sold the Manufacture is under evident Discouragement On the other hand if there are more made and less sold that Discouragement encreases to a Distraction the Manufacture languishes and is in a kind of Dropsy where the Repletion exceeding the Evacuation the Body swells in Bulk but declines in Strength and dies of the worst kind of Consumption  There is no question but that upon the apparent Encrease of the Manufactures in  England  during those many Years mentioned in particular as above the great Advantage made by that Trade and the vast Estates acquired even by the Manufacturers themselves in their ordinary Business encouraged others to fall into it and even encouraged those that were in it to enlarge their Business to launch out as their Stocks encreased farther and farther into that Trade  This Humour continues to this day and is now become the great Grievance of the Manufacture in general and will if not timely prevented be ruinous to the Trade in the End as I shall make appear in its Place  While the Manufacture was in its full Extent abroad while it was the Mistress of the World in Trade had no Rivals and no Attempts were made to mimick it or imitate it but that it had an uninterrupted Sale abroad the Encrease of the Quantity at home was far from being a Grievance either to the Country or to the Trade and during the happy Years of its thus currently going off vast Additions to the Quantity were made at home such as if you will give Credit to some People would in a few Years have glutted the whole World with our Goods tho' there had been no Check given to the Vent of it abroad  I could give a long History of the Encrease of the Manufacture in  England  I mean as a Work or Fabrick even whole Towns nay Parts of Counties have within the Memory of some still alive been employed in it who were never employed before  I could likewise enter into the Detail of the Changes and Turns which the Manufacture itself has suffered by changing the Kinds as particularly the changing the Clothing or Clothmaking into the making narrow and lighter Kinds of Cloth such as we call Druggets and Ketsies instead of Broadcloth  in the Western Parts of  England  such as the Counties of  Wilts Berks  and  Devon  and Sagathies and Duroys a thin and light sort of Stuff instead of thick ClothSerges at  Taunton  in  Somersetshire  and other Parts adjoining by which Exchange of Kinds it is the Opinion of many Men of Judgment the  English  Manufacture in general has suffered extremely and a Door opened to the Attempts of Foreigners who encroached upon us by those Imitutions and Delusions but were not able to come up to us in the essential Part of the Manufacture  viz  the Clothing Part The Case was thus  The  French  were the first who as I have said set up to rival our Manufactures and having gotten Workmen as well as Materials from  England  they set up a Cloathing Manufacture as well at  Rouen  and  Caen  and other Places in  Normandy  as at  Nismes  and the adjacent Cities in  Languedock  and  Provence  But the  French  according to the known superficial Humour of that Nation contenting themselves with keeping up to the Standard of Broad Cloth in  Languedoc  only because they were oblig'd to follow the Pattern of the  English  there for the  Turkey  Trade in other Places made it light loose and spongy thinner in Substance and slighter in Workmanship and this not being able to carry the Breadth of the Broad Cloth they alter'd to the usual Stuff Breadth of half Ell or half Yard as their ordinary Stuffs were made  These they call'd Cloths at first but seeing they would not keep up the Credit of that Name as the  English  Cloth did they gave them several Names from the Towns or Counties where they were made such as  Drap de Normandy Drap de Berry Drap de Lorrain  and so of the rest  Had we let the  French  go on their own way and kept up at home to the old  English  Manufacture of Broad Cloth the  French  to this Day had been distanc'd in their new Attempt but with a Weakness never to be defended while they with Difficulty followed us we faced about and simply followed them  They brought their Silk Stuffs and  Spanish  Druggets and light thin  French  Serges into Wear and into Fashion and they were in the right because they could make no better We to Ape them in their Mode fall into the same sorts of Stuffs and so made that which was their Necessity be our Mischief  By this Means not only we wore their sorry slight Manufactures and even brought them privately from  France  it self but fond of our own Mischiefs we quit the Broad  Cloth the ancient Glory of  England  as to Manufacture and fall into the making of light Stuffs for Men's Wear to the Ruin of our own Manufactures as much as in us lay for these new foolish Things neither employ'd an equal Number of Hands or consum'd an equal Quantity of the Wool in both which they accommodated the  French  who neither had at first a Number of skilful Workmen to make them or a Quantity of Wool to make them with but in both we weaken'd our own Country for this at once caus'd the Wool to lye on hand unwrought and thousands of Poor to go unemploy'd  The great Promoter of this Debauchery in Trade for such it might be call'd was one  D'Oyly  a WarehouseKeeper in  London  who valuing himself upon that for which he ought according to the Laws of  Persia  to have his Name be made infamous and his House be made a Dunghil boasted of his Merit and call'd his new  French  Mimickry of a Manufacture  Doyly  's  Stuffs  and such was the Vanity of the Day that we saw the whole Town nay we might say the whole Nation run into them and the ancient Manufacture of Broad Cloth lay by the Walls the substantial WoollenDrapers had nothing to do no Trade at their Shops and the new StuffMerchant  D'Oyly  had his great Warehouse near  ExeterExchange  in the  Strand  throng'd with Buyers from Morning to Night and the Man got an Estate in one Summer's Trade  It is true God and a hard Winter should have the Thanks of the poor Manufacturers while they live the Severity of the great Frost falling in immediately upon it brought the good warm cloathing Trade into Mode again and set the Poor at work in some tolerable Degree so at least as to relieve them for that time  But this unhappy Humour reviv'd so far as brought our Manufacturers into the way of making a middle Kind between Cloth and Stuff so as on one Side to suit the Climate and yet as near as might be on the other to follow the  French  Folly also and this introduc'd the making Druggets Sagathies Chamlets Duroys and the several kinds of Men's Stuffs with which we have as it were made War with our own Manufacture and jostled the Broad Cloth as much as we could out of the World so that in short if those light things which the  French  made because they could make no better did not become the universal Mode of our Country and the better and more important Cloathing on which the whole Nation depended go quite out of use it was none of our Fault  The Truth is tho' the first Madness wore off and the  D'Oyly  Stuffs in a little time did sicken and glut the Town yet This is certain that the wearing of Drugget and Stuffs Chamlets and Duroys and suchlike slight things was a terrible Blow to the antient Clothing Manufacture to this Day it has not recovered it and perhaps never will  Thus far the Manufacture declined by our Own Folly It is true indeed that these slight thin Stuffs tho' they did not consume so much Wool or employ so many Hands as the Clothing yet as they sent the People oftner to Market the Quantity made seemed to be some Amends to the Manufacture and to the Poor But then they opened a Door to the  French  to sell their slight halfmade Goods at foreign Markets for the Fashion also took Root whereas if the Manufacture of Broadcloth had been kept up the  French  would never have been able to have hurt us at home or abroad  But this is not all I shall give you a farther Account of the Declining of the Manufacture in its Sale abroad and of the Reasons of it in particular more ruinous than this But here I must take notice too as I have said above how the Making encreased whether the Sale encreased or no and this we shall give you some unanswerable Evidence of in a few Examples  First  Upon this unhappy falling into the  French  Fashion of wearing Stuffs instead of Broadcloth I mean for the Mens Wear a strange and sudden Metamorphosis in Trade followed here in  London  Spittlefields  had been eminent for many Years for the Silk Manufacture encouraged and greatly encreased by the coming over of the  French  Refugees in to and the Numbers of People encreasing there the Buildings likewise encreased so that what with RibbandWeavers and BroadWeavers it was generally said there was an hundred thousand Weavers in  Spittlefields  and the adjacent Streets  But the Trade was not equal to the Numbers of the People the Streets began to be desolate the Houses empty and the People shifted about to other Places and to other Employments as Occasion supply'd them when all on a sudden we were surprised to find Woolcombers and Staplers setting up in  Spittlefields  and Shops began to open there for Worsted Yarn and for comb'd Wool and abundance of the  French  Women especially went spinning about the Streets This was employed at first among the StockingWeavers or FrameworkKnitters which Manufacture about that time took a new Turn all over  England  from Knitting to Weaving or  Framemaking  to the great Loss of the Poor in the Countries where those Goods were usually made where many thousands were formerly employed in Knitting but now were quite struck out of the Work by the Gross of the Stockings being wrought in the Frame  This began the Woollen Trade in  Spittlefields  but when the  D'Oyly Stuffs  had as I have said above spread the Town and the Humour continued for some time  Spittlefields  took another new Turn and in one Year more we saw it as full of Stuff and Worsted as before of Silk the SilkWeavers turned their Hands to the narrow Woollen Manufactures and the Quantity of those Manufactures now made there of almost all Kinds especially such as were formerly made at  Norwich  and the Parts adjacent is such that in a word  Spittlefields  is become the principal Seat or Center of those Manufactures in  England  and yet the City of  Norwich  as above is supposed to be in as full Employ as ever or at least as usual so that this whole Manufacture of  Spittlefields  is an Encrease upon the Manufacture in general and must be answered for by a proportioned Sale somewhere or other abroad or at home or else so far the Encrease is too great for the Consumption and is not a Benefit but a Loss to the Manufacture and adds in the worst manner to its declining Circumstances  I could give you a like Account of large Manufactures of Druggets and other Goods erected in several Towns and Places in  England  within these few Years where no such or other Woollen Manufactures worth naming in this case were wro  g  before a  particularly at the City of  Bristol  for Example But this of  Sp  ttlefields  is so flagrant an Instance where such a prodigious Work is now carried o  and where within the Memo  y  the Writer hereof no Woollen Manufactures were made that I need enquire no farther into it I shall add but one other Capital Article of Encrease and this is that of the Bay Trade in  Essex  It is evident  Trade was contained within the particular Towns of  Colc  est  r  and  B  cking  in  Essex  where the making  f Bayes was first begun and was at least principally established the Trade flourished the Goods were current abroad commanded ready Money at home and were seldom or never w  thout a Market nor was there a Manufacture in  Europe  which better maintained the Credit of its Make Insomuch that a Merchant at  Cadiz  or  Lisbon  coming to an  English  Merchant's Warehouse to  Bays has no more to do but to open one Corner of the Ba  e and look upon the Seals  of the Town of  Colchester  and by that they were sure to know of what Value the Goods were and were certain to find them answer both in Lengths and Goodness  But the Neighbouring Towns finding the  Colchester  and  Bocking  Baymakers grow rich thrust themselves into that Trade and now the Bayes are made at  Coggeshal  at  Witham  at  Kelvedon  at  Braintre  at  Halsted  and in a word at almost all the most considerable Towns in  Essex  beyond  Cbelmsford  Nor is this all but even the Baymakers themselves upon the least Start of the Trade and upon any sudden quick Demand from abroad push in with such Eagerness and encrease their Quantity to such a Degree that they bring more to the Market than all the World can take off  This has I may say ruin'd the Trade and the Consequence is that as soon as ever that small Run is over and the Demand from abroad ceases the Market is immediately throng'd with Goods they are pawned and pledged to every monied Man in the Place 'till they can be put off the Price sinks the Labour of the Poor stops and the Baymakers are often broke and undone  Nor is the Credit or real Value of the Goods supported for the Baymakers being now extended over the whole Country and working out of the Jurisdiction of the BayHall at  Colchester  they put what Goods they please upon the Market and what Marks or Seals they please upon the Goods so that the Credit of the Manufacture is sunk and no Man trusts to the Seals of the Goods any more but takes Care to look into the Goods himself and see with his own Eyes that he is not cheated  I cannot but esteem this last to be one eminent Degree of the Declining of that Manufacture for if once a Manufacture declines in its Credit I shall always conclude it is declin'd in its Sale or will soon be so  but that by the way  The present Article I am upon and which I lay the whole Stress of the Question now upon is the Encrease of the Quantity beyond the Demand that more are made than are or can be consumed which I think is apparent in many other Particulars  I sum the whole Observation up in this one Head  viz  that this very Encrease is a Grievance which in the end may be ruinous to the whole Woollen Manufacture of  England  if some new Doors of Commerce are not opened abroad to raise a Consumption equal to that Encrease or some Method  be not taken to put a Stop to the farther Encrease of the Fabrick at home so as not to make the Manufacture be too great for the Sale whether it be at home or abroad  CHAP V Of the real Causes of the Decay of our Manufacture arising partly from Prohibitions abroad but chiefly from our refusing the Wear of it at Home and something offered for the Remedy  BUT 'tis needful now to enquire into the State of our Manufacture abroad as to the Consumption of the several Species in those Countries where our Trade used to be settled If we find the Sale or Demand encreasing abroad the encreasing of the Quantity at home would certainly be so far from a Grievance that it would be the Glory and Prosperity of our Commerce and of our Country and if every County in  England  were as fully employed in manufacturing as  Wiltshire Devonshire Norfolk  and  Essex  every City as  Norwich  and  Exeter  and every Market Town as  Froom Taunton Leeds  or  Colchester  it would be the Wealth of the whole and the greatest Felicity that this World ever produced to a Nation  But the Case is not so but far otherwise instead of the Consumption encreasing abroad instead of a larger Demand we see all Parts of the World envying us most Parts endeavouring to imitate us and as many as can encouraging their own upstart Manufactures in the room of the  British  and too many totally prohibiting the Sale or the wearing our Manufactures that their own however mean and ordinary may take Place  And not to dwell upon some late Prohibitions of the  English  Woollen Goods in  Spain  and in the Island of  Sicily  at  Lintz Passau Vienna  and other Places in the Emperor's Dominions done rather by way of Insult to our Nation at this Crisis of their Affairs than that they are able to carry on any Equivalent Manufactures of their own I say not to lay any Stress upon these yet it must be said that other Places have of late Years attempted our Manufacture and some but with too much Success and Prohibitions rather natural and consequential than political encrease upon us every Day  It is the general Opinion and I have joyn'd with it in Part in the beginning of this Discourse that there is no Wool to be found in any Part of the World or at least not in  Europe  capable of working into such Manufactures and of making such several Sorts of Goods as we at present furnish the World with and upon this very Principle we carry our Boasts of the  British  Manufacture so high Now in some particular Things we are right I mean right in our Judgment namely that the World has not the Wool that is has not any Wool capable of working into such Manufactures as we make tho' as to Boasting as we do I shall never come into that Part because boasting of our Superiority is but firing the rest of the World with an unwearyed Application to supply the Defect  But let us distinguish here with a little more Temper than we usually do There is a manifest Difference between having no Wool fit for any Manufacture at all and not having the best and the finest Wool of the longest Staple the firmest Body and the finest and softest Quality There is a manifest Difference between the Wool being good for nothing and being not so good as the  English  or  Irish  Wool To descend to Particulars  It is true  Europe  take it BY and LARGE as we express it from End to End does not produce a Wool capable of making our fine Broad Cloths of  Warminster Trowbridge Bradford  and  Froom  or our fine  Gloucester  and  Worcester  Whites no nor perhaps such as our  Wakefield  and  Leeds  Cloth tho' what we call coarse yet of Substance and Weight inimitable nor of many several Manufactures of other Kinds such as  Devonshire  Kersies  Exeter  and  Taunton  Serges  Devizes  and  Bristol  Druggets  Andover  and  Newberry  Shaloons and the like  But to say therefore that there are no other of our Manufactures that can be made abroad and that even where they have no  English  Wool that I cannot and must not grant because Experience teaches us the contrary every Day to our great Disadvantage in Trade  Saxony  a large and fertile Country in  Germany  notwithstanding the Severity of the Winters which are sometimes such as gives a Check to the Production of Wool yet not only has a very good kind of Wool but a very large Quantity of it and the  Saxons  an industrious People are already advanc'd so far in the Manufacturing the Wool that they make two particular Manufactures which are very  useful in those cold Countries and which they formerly bought from  England  either brought thither to their Fair at  Leipsick  by way  H  burgh  or bought at the great Mart at  Frankfort  and carried over Land to the  Elb  at  Magdeburgb  these were  Colchester  Bayes and  Welch  Flannels  Every one knows that as these Goods are soft and warm and are suited very particularly for preserving the Bodies of those who wear them in th  se Northern Parts of the World from the Severity of the Cold so they are not made of the coarsest and harshest of the Wool on the contrary they are made thick and downy well mill'd and the Nap raised which would not be if the Wool was not fine and soft and the Workmanship close and thick  Yet these they now make in  Saxony  not only in sufficient Quantities to supply themselves and their own Markets but we see the Flannels and Bayes of  Saxony  sold every Year at  Frankfort  at  Nurembergh  and most of the other Fairs of Note in the Upper  Germany  and what is the Consequence of this Not any Prohibition of the  English  Bays and Flannels no we may send ours thither also and may sell them there too if we can but Nature forbids it the Thing is a Prohibition of it self ours are not sold there because their own are sufficient and we need not say are cheaper for it would be very hard if they can be made at all that they should not be made cheaper than the  English  which pass thro' so many Hands so many Countries pay so many Embarkations Assurances Commissions and other Charges and are carried so far as well by Land as WaterCarriage  It is true the Wool of  Saxony  is of a brown or a kind of Russet Colour occasion'd by the Climate or the particular Breed of the Sheep or from whatsoever other Incident in Nature we cannot account for but as the Bayes are generally Dyed and many of the Flannels also it is not distinguish'd for that the Wool however Russet or of a Greyish Colour at first and as it grows on the Sheep's Back yet it is not at all the worse to take any Colour in the Dyingfat but as some think is rather the better  I need go no farther for the Proof of this than to appeal to those Merchants who trading to those Countries usually had Commissions from thence to buy great Quantities of those Goods here and let Them tell us how many  Bayes or Flannels they now have Orders for for the Fair at  Leipsick  or the Mart at  Frankfurt  or rather whether any  English  Bayes and Flannels are sent thither or no  But this is not all Let us look in the next Place into the King of  Prussia  's Dominions I mean that Part of his Country which was formerly call'd the Electorate of  Brandenburgh  the Country about  Magdeburgh  the Country upon the  Havel  and the  Sprhee  there they have Wool which tho' coarse and harsh yet the Government of  Prussia  careful to improve the Country to the utmost and to employ their own Poor for their own Work causes all those coarser Manufactures which their own Wool is capable of making to be made among themselves and tho' these Manufactures are not equal to the  British  yet as they are sufficient to the Demands of their own Poor and serve to cloath the Boors and Pesants that is to say the Country People and Plowmen and labouring Poor they think it reasonable to Prohibit all foreign Manufactures which usually were Imported for those Uses such were our  Yorkshire  Kersies double and single  Dosens  the coarse Goods made in  Lancashire  such as  HalfThicks Pennistones Duffiels  Blanketting and other Woollen Manufactures made for the Cloathing and Covering of the Poor  These were formerly Shipp'd off in great Quantities for  Hamburgh  and for  Stetin  and  Straelsond  and other Ports on the South Coast of the  Baltick  but now the General Consumption of such Goods has been stopp'd for some Years the People making all those Things at home  It is the like in  Sweden  where tho' their Wool is still coarser and the Manufactures they make the poorest and roughest that can be imagined yet the setting their own Poor to work to make their own Cloathing however mean serves to employ them keeps their Money at home and all still shortens us in our Exportations of those Goods to that Country  It is true our finer Cloths gain still an Admittance into those Countries because the Wool even of  Saxony  is not fine enough for such a Manufacture and this may shew us that we have certainly been in the Wrong of it and have weakened the Interest of our Manufactures abroad exceedingly by leaving our Cloathing Trade to sink upon our Hands and turn our Workmen to the lighter Manufactures which other Countries with their coarse Wool are so much easier able to supply But to go on  So many of our Woollen Manufactures being thus excluded from  Sweden  from  Brandenburgh  from  Saxony  and from so many Parts of  Germany  let us look next towards the South and here we find the  Swiss  of  Zurick  making Chamlets Shalloons and several other Sorts of Manufactures as well for Mens Wearing as Womens the same as are made in  Spittlefields Norwich Andover  and several other Places in  England  the  Swiss  perform these Works now with much Accuracy and it is hard to know them from the like sorts of Goods made in  England  the Workmen also who set them up being fetch'd from  Spittlefields  where they learned the Art and how to manage both the Wool the Yarn the Loom the Dressing and in a word the whole Finishing after the  English  manner and without flattering our selves as well perform'd  Did the  Zurickers  only supply their own City or their own Canton with these Goods the Loss to our Manufacture would be no more than the meer Negative upon their Consumption but I should not be just to the matter in hand if I did not tell you that to the irreparable Loss of the  English  Manufactures these Goods are brought from  Zurick  by the River  Rhine  to the City of  Basle  and from thence down the  Rhine  to  Mentz  and then still by Water up the  Main  to the Mart at  Frankfort au Main  where they go too far in Supplanting the  English  Goods of the same Denomination and to such a Degree are they arriv'd that I am told there are very few  English  Goods of these Sorts now sold there the  Zurickers  supplying the Fair with them as good as the  English  and considerably cheaper  Thus we see our Manufacture cut short on every Side by the Envy or Industry of the several Nations of  Germany  and  Sweden  totally Prohibited in  France  and very much supplanted in several other Places  The Emperor has for some time encouraged Manufactures in  Bohemia  in  Austria  and in all the Hereditary Countries and the Consequence of this 'tis expected will be a General Prohibition of all the  English  Woollen Manufactures It has been attempted lately by way of Pique and Resentment between the Imperial Court and  Great Britain  But that Part may be esteem'd a Jest compar'd with other Countries  However it may be well worth considering whether if this general Humour of manufacturing should spread far in  Europe  as we are just now told it begins to do in  Poland  and in  Muscovy  and is threatned in  Spain  what the Impression it  may make upon our Manufactures in  England  may be in a few Years  As these Invasions are Increasing so our Manufacture must be Declining in proportion unless it could be said that some yet farther Branch of Foreign Commerce can be found out for the Consumption of our Manufacture which it is time enough to speak of when we see it in Prospect and which I should be glad to say was probable  I must acknowledge if the present War should proceed to Extremities so as to lay open the Trade from  England  to the  Spanish WestIndies  directly I should venture to say it would give our Manufactures a new Turn and they would feel a Spring of Prosperity for some time and that considerably too especially if some Bounds were set to the Manufacturers at home else if they launch'd out in Quantity according to Custom as is mentioned above they would glut the Market tho' they were to have a new  America  opened to them for the Trade once in every five Years  However I see no room to argue upon this remote Prospect they that are Sanguine enough upon the War to run on making and lay up a Stock of Goods in expectation of a Market the next Fair at  PortoBelo  or when  La Vera Cruz  shall be turn'd  English  may go on their own way I am for sharing no  Bear Skins  But I must come nearer home still and must take the Freedom to insist that our Manufacture is in a State of Decay too from our Conduct at home much more than from all Prohibitions and Interruptions abroad I am not dispos'd to make this Work a Satyr upon my own Country but certainly we are the first if not the only Nation in the World who having the best and most profitable Product and the best and most agreeable Manufacture of our own of any Nation in  Europe  if not in the World are the most backward to our own Improvement  A Manufacture valuable in it Self infinitely profitable to the Poor unexceptionably pleasant to the Rich not too hot for the Summer not too cold for the Winter light enough for  July  warm enough for  December  beautiful as the finest Silks suiting with Laces Embroidery and all manner of Ornaments better than even Silk it self and yet Ornamental and Rich in its own Lustre  A Manufacture receptive of the brightest and deepest Colours Gay enough for the Bridegroom Solemn enough for the Widow Rich enough for a Coronation Grave enough for the deepest Mourning  A Manufacture that has not one Exception to be made against it or one Reason to be given for disliking it except the weakest of all Reasons the Love of Change and Variety or that wicked Reason which a Man gave why he did not love his beautiful and agreeable Wife  viz  only because she was his own  A Manufacture that all the World covets envies us for strives to imitate nay are vain of but thinking they can imitate it  A Manufacture which those other Nations when they have faintly imitated it are obliged to Prohibit by the severest Laws or else all their People would run into them and which they do strive to come at and purchase notwithstanding the strictest Prohibitions  A Manufacture which is apparently declining for want of a Consumption equal to its Bulk and because of the too successful Attempts of other People to set it up among themselves and because of the Improvements that the Industry of Strangers and the Indolence of the  British  Manufacturers assists them in  And yet with such a Manufacture as this we cannot persuade our selves to wear our own Produce to propagate our own Industry or employ our own People but we are no sooner Prohibited the Use of one foreign Bauble but we fly to another first we turn'd our Backs upon our own wrought Silks and run to  India  and  China  for all the slightest and foolishest Trash in the World such as their Chints slight Silks painted Cottons  Herba  Silk and no Silks as if any thing but our own was to be thought beautiful and any thing but what was best for us was to be encouraged by us  When this Extravagance was also check'd by a Law we run then into another Extream and still turning our Fancy against our own Manufactures on a sudden we saw all our Women Rich and Poor cloath'd in Callico printed and painted the Gayer and the more Tawdry the better and though ordinary mean lowpriz'd and soon in Rags the gayest Ladies appeared in them on the greatest Occasions  Thus the Ancient Manufactures of  Great Britain  were despis'd by our own People and the Bread taken out of the Mouths of the Poor the Hands that would have laboured could get no Work the Trade sunk the Manufacturers slarved and the Wool lay by in heaps unwrought and unfold  to the general impoverishing of the People and the Ruin of the Manufacture it self  We are now by another Law of Prohibition restrained from the wearing of painted Callicoes and what follows the Temper is not at all reclaim'd nor do they so much as incline to return to the Use of their own Manufactures which is the main and best End of the Prohibition But as if we were resolv'd to run down our whole Country and ruin our Poor with our own Hands we run to the remotest Corners for some Shift or other to cheat our selves and now we see the general Cloathing of the meaner Peoplespecially runs into the meanest tawdriest Colours stamp'd upon the most ordinary Linnen fetch'd from  Scotland Ireland  or indeed any where as if any thing but our own was to be our Choice and as if we had forsworn our own Manufactures and were asham'd to be dress'd in our own Cloths  How shall we expect our own Manufactures should grow and encrease while this is the Case and if we will not encourage our own Growth and the Labour of our own People how should we expect Foreigners should do it  In short as I said of the Woollen Manufactures of  Saxony  that they are an effectual Prohibition of the  English  so I may say of our People's running into the Wear of printed Linnens Callicoes  c  they are a tacit Prohibition of the Manufactures for what is a Rejecting the Manufacture by a kind of general Consent but a Prohibition in effect and how should the Manufacture be supported when our own People turn their Backs upon it and when even the People that make it will hardly be perswaded to wear it  I believe no Man will ask me after this how I will prove the Manufacture to be in a declining State or what is the Reason of it no more can they ask what Remedy is proper to apply to this Evil 'Tis an unaccountable Thing in a Manufacturing Nation like this that Men should ask what will restore the Trade when they see so evidently what has been the Ruin of it  The Answer is short and according to my Title the Only Way to restore our Manufactures is to WEAR THEM The Consumption at home is infinitely great If our whole populous Nation were obliged to cloath only in their own Manufacture we should neither complain of our selves or value the Prohibition of others  If you will not do this and the next Direction is as short as that you must abate the Quantity and as you Consume less Make less what will Encreasing the Work do for us while we Decrease the Consumption It will in the End not only ruin the trading People but ruin the Trade it Self But I have not room to enlarge upon that Part here  FINIS
