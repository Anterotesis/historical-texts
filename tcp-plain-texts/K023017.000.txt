 A LETTER TO Mr  ROWE  Concerning the NONJUROR  Price Sixpence  A CLUE To the COMEDY of the NonJuror  WITH SOME Hints of Consequence Relating to that PLAY  IN A LETTER TO  N ROWE  Esq  Poet Laureat to His Majesty  Quo Musa tendis desine pervicax  Referre Sermones Deorum  Hor  LONDON  Printed for  E Curll  in  Fleetstreet    A CLUE to the COMEDY OF THE NONJUROR With some Hints of Consequence relating to that PLAY  Dear Mr  Rowe  _I Entirely agree with you That there has not of late appear'd in Publick a more  exquisite Piece of Satire  than the Comedy call'd the  Nonjuror  or that better deserv'd the  Distinction that was shown it not only by your Self as His Majesty's Laureat but by all the Loyal Party in general I also agree with you that perhaps there never was a Piece of fine  DramaTheological Satire  the true Scope of which has been less understood I am at a Loss which to admire most the noble free Spirit of our Friend the Author the insensibility of those whom the Satire is  really Aim'd at  or the ignorant Rage of those  dissaffected Jacobite Wretches  who cry out when they are not hurt You were pleas'd to desire me when we met last to put upon Paper the few Hints I dropt to you in Conversation upon this Subject and which I doubt not are sufficient to make any unprejudic'd ReÌ„ader of your and my Opinion namely  That Dissaffection to the Government is the smallest Immorality which is pointed at by this Play and which indeed is only introduced to hide a far  deeper Design  and far  more useful Satire  In order to set this in it's true Light I will but barely  point  at the several Figures of the Comedy and make some short Remarks upon their Attitudes without the Illmanners of naming any particular Person but leaving the free and impartial Reader to draw his own Inferences Two general Observations only are necessary to be premised because every common Judge is not so sensible of them as we who have been Writers all our Lives  The  First  is That when we  Rebuke our Superiours  the Fable ought to be so coucn'd as to make the Criminal give Judgment against himself before he is aware an Art as ancient at least as the Days of  Nathan  But if the Scene of Action be laid in a Subject not only quite  foreign  but seemingly  opposite  to the principal Aim of the Satire the Address will be still the more refined because by this Method the Author introduceth  Facts  and  Personages  which the guilty will be sure to Condemn not only from  natural Equity  but  natural  Aversion  Thus for Example To engage a  Tory  to condemn a Piece of Iniquity in the Abstract one need only lay the Scene among  Whigs  and so on the contrary And  Secondly  I would put the Reader in mind that in Fables of this Nature it is usual to represent  whole Parties of Men by single Personages  This premised let us observe the principal Figure thar presents it self to our View I mean Dr  Wolf  whose Character answers to  Moliere  's  Tartuffe  who is known to have represented a  certain puritanical Bishop in France  We next are to take Notice That  Wolf  in the Stile of  Ecclesiastical Allegory  constantly signifies the  Presbyterian Party  You know it is thus in the  Hind  and  Panther  and most other Pieces of Controversial Divinity or Poetry So Dr  Wolf  is a  Presbyterian  Dr  Wolf  expects for his Services in  Betraying the Church  great  Ecclesiastical  Preferment  as Sir  John  expresseth it  Nonjuror pag  an Office for Life which on whatsoever Pretence of Misbehaviour no Civil Government can deprive him of  This is Ironically represented afterwards by the  See of Thetford  So in short Dr  Wolf  is a Bishop  This  Presbyterian  Bishop has wrote something about the  Case of Schism  and the  Colonel  tells his Father  That he  pag  has read enough of him in the  Daily Courant What Bishop has publish'd in the  Daily Courant  is  lippis et tonsoribus notum  This Bishop protests great Zeal for the  Church  at the same Time that he is betraying it On which the  Colonel  tells Sir  John Tho'  pag  I have always honour'd your Concern  for the Church I little thought it was for a Church that is Establish'd no where  i e  No visible Church  This Bishop is mark'd with another strong Characteristick managing a Dispute with  Heartly  about  the Nature of Prayer  That it ought not to be  Tedious  pag  outward Expression not so absolutely necessary since Heaven knew the true Intention of the Heart  pag  And then he talks of his own  Manual of Devotions  This Bishop also pretends a mighty Regard to  tender Consciences  He tell's  Heartly  That we  pag  ought to allure them to what is Good by the gentlest easiest Means we can  nor give the least colour of Offence to tender Consciences  The  Colonel  here urges the  Constitution  against him and the force of the Laws and desires him to explain himself to which this Bishop Answers  pag  Sir  I shall not explain my Self But make your best of what I've saidBut Power perhaps may change it's Hands and you e're long as little dare to speak your mind as I do  viz  That there may come a Time when this Constitution you talk so much of may be overturned  Sir  John  is fully satisfy'd that the  Doctor  is all this while a  pag  true stanch Member of the  English  Catholick Church  mark that is such a Church as  comprehends all Sects and Parties whatsoever  But lest these Lines shou'd not be strong enough the Author gives the finishing Stroke  This Bishop is at last discover'd to be a  Jesuit  in Disguise By whom By one of his  SchoolBoys  in whom he had distilled some of his  Jesuitical Principles  And most remarkable it is what the  Colonel  says on this Occasion That  pag  Charles  begs  he will not insist upon the Discovery 'till his Circumstances will allow it  Almost in the very Stile of some  Letters  that passed upon a parallel Occasion between a  Master of a School  and a  Reverend Doctor  At last  Substantial Affadavits  are produced to prove Dr  Wolf  to have been Educated a  Jesuit  by which as it is usual in Allegorical Writers  the close Conjunction  of a Reverend  Prelate  and a certain  Jesuit is most injuriously and scandalously insinuated  So here is a  Prelate  and a  Jesuit  and his  Gang  got into the Family of Sir  John  Let us next see what they are to do there Why they contrive the  Ruin  of his Family and the  disinheriting  and  expulsion  of his  Children  with so great an Assurance of Success that the  Doctor  talks of Sir  John  in this manner  pag  Poor Man he knows not his own Weakness he is moulded into any Shape if you but gently stroke his Humour I intend to Morrow to perswade him 'tis for the Interest of our Cause it should be so and then I have him sure  Poor Sir  John  indeed  I must here put you in mind of my second Observation that by the single Person of Dr  Wolf  without any forced Construction may be understood a whole Sett or Party of Men To proceed then  The Play Opens with a Dispute between Sir  John  and his  Daughter  about the Formality of  Christening  and Sir  John  is at it again  pag  being extremely rejoyced that  Heartly  is  Christ'ned  according to the  Right Form  There is also mention made of  Searching the Register  c  Next we see Dr  Wolf  insulting Sir  John'  s  Son  and  Daughter  he breaks into the  Daughter's  Bedchamber before she is quite  Up  and when  she resents it  he tell's her  pag  Compose your Transport  Madam I came by your  Father's Desire  for what I have done Madam I had your  Father's Authority  and shall leave him to answer you  The  Daughter  replies  Ibid  It is false he gave you no Authority to insult me What is it you presume upon your Function does that exempt you from the Manners of a Gentleman  At last his foul Behaviour provokes the  Son  to that degree that he call's him  pag  Villain  and  Rascal  Sir  John  is nettled at this he tells his  Son  and  Daughter  pag  I see your Aim Your Malice on your own vile Head To me it but the more endears him Either submit and  ask his Pardon  for this Wrongor this Instant  leave  my Sight  my  House  my  Family  for ever  The  Son  answers  pag  Tho' I would hazard Life to save you from the Ruin he misleads you to could Die to Reconcile my Duty to your Favour yet on the Terms that Villain offers 'tis Merit to refuse it I Glory in the Disgrace your Errors give me  In short Sir  John  's Attachment to Dr  Wolf  was so great that there appear'd but small Hopes of ever opening Sir  John  's Eyes And remarkable is the Lamentation of the  Son  upon that Occasion  pag  What horrid Hands is this poor Family fall'n into How little is my Father like himself by Nature Open Just and Generous but this vile Hypocrite drives his weak Passions like the Wind and I  foresee at last will dash him on his Ruin  When Dr  Wolf  had wrought up the Passion of Sir  John  to this degree as to turn his  Children out of Doors  then he interposeth his good Offices and proposeth a  Reconciliation  I beg the Reader to observe the  Terms  of it  That his Child should be at the sole Disposal of Dr  Wolf and do nothing without  his Consent  It must here be observ'd that the Daughter had a Fortune of  her own independent on the Father  upon which she seems to value her Self  pag  Have not I  l  in my own hands have not I had the full Swing of my own Airs and humours these four years  Mark the precise time But she is put in mind by  the  Son  that tho' the Father could not  deprive her of her Fortune he might abridge  her Equipage in these words  Ibid  however a Father's Consent might have clapt a pair of horses more to your Coach  But at last he applauds her resolution and tells her she  speaks with the Spirit of a freeborn Englishman  Mark now the modesty of Dr  Wolf  he proposes as the Lowest and  last condition that she should resign the half of this independent fortune  pag  Is not two thousand pounds worth two Thousand pounds  Is not  half  better than  nothing  Observe next good Mr  Rowe  how Dr  Wolf  endeavours to debauch Lady  Woodvill  and make her Subservient to his Villainous designs This Lady is described as having a great Ascendant over Sir  John's  Spirit that  She keeps no Assemblys  that she had been  Poor  and  Beautiful  while Sir  John  was  Rich  and  Amourous  This Lady proves honest and trusty and contributes in the conclusion to the discovery of the wicked purposes of Dr  Wolf  Pray take notice too of a very odd Episode that seem to contribute very little to the main Action That is Dr  Wolf  's endeavouring to Bring Sir  John  into a  Scheme  of  Church Comprehension  Referring again to his  Case of Schism  he tells Sir  John  that  pag  differences are not so material as some would represent them Ah could we be brought to a Temper a great many seeming Contradictions might be reconciled  I allow this is a  Comprehension  of a different kind but I beg leave to remind you and my Readers of my first observation that the  Circumstances of a Fable  do not determine the  Satire  But you Sir who are intimate with Mr  Cibber  may examine and know the Truth of this  Nothing is so plain as the Catastrophe when Dr  Wolf  thought himself sure of his Blow and had brought Sir  John  to believe that his  pag  hot brain'd  Son as he calls him had a Design to get his Estate he instantly makes Sir  John  resolve to repay it in kind by disinheriting him  But at last there arises a misfortune from a Corner where the  Doctor  least suspected it Some of his own Party whom he thought inviolably attach'd to his interests discover his wicked purposes This Sett of Men is represented by  Charles  an ingenious Gentleman a Servant of Sir  John  's a man of Business a good  Greek  and  Latin  Scholar c This  Charles  it seems highly obliged by the Generous treatment of the  Son  and enamour'd of the good Qualities of the  Daughter  both reveals and prevents the whole  mystery of Iniquity  Upon which Dr  Wolf  seeing his project dissappointed vents his Rage upon this honest Gentleman and attempts his Life  Lastly Mr  Cibber  to obviate all possibility of mistaking his meaning upon the winding up of the whole design breaks on a sudden into an open discourse of  Politicks  talks of  embroiling the Nation  and  ending Publick disputes  and calls upon King  George  with abundance more good  Morality  very well worth observing  Thus Sir according to your desire I have given a short Sketch of the  Fable  and  Characters  of this Play just enough to enable some person of greater  Sagacity  to find out who are meant by every particular Personage of the  Drama  I am sure I would not presume so much as to guess  But one Thing I must observe which I remember we both took particular notice of It is that the Author tho' questionless a great master of Stile puts  bad English  into the mouths of most of his Personages So that indeed scarce any of e'm talk at all like  English Folks  but perpetually make use of an uncorrect  Foreign Jargon  What his drift is in this I cannot imagine but the Instances of it are obvious to every Reader and numerous  in every Page  I
