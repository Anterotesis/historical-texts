 ROSE and COLIN A COMIC OPERA IN ONE ACT As it is performed at the THEATREROYAL IN COVENT GARDEN  LONDON Printed for G KEARSLY No FleetStreet M DCC LXXVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following little Piece is an imitation of the French comic operas of one act which are generally characterized either by their natural simplicity or some single striking incident and little or nothing more is designedIt is now first attempted to introduce this species of entertainment on the English theatre as containing excellent situations for light airsOn the French stage notwithstanding all their merit they tire in the length of time taken for representation and were they spun out to the common length of our afterpieces it is conceived they would be found still more insufficient  The subject matter therefore being wholly preserved and the dialogue both varied and compressed they are with every deference submitted to public judgment  C DIBDIN  CHARACTERS  MEN  GREGORY  Mr REINHOLD  HIGGINS  Mr FEARON

other a window which opens and shuts under the window is a table and arm chair and very near it are hanging a saddle and bridle on the table are a cushion and bobbins for making lace a spinningwheel and several skiens of flax are lying about and there is another chair upon which in the course of the piece Rose sets down to work Rose is discovered  AIR  POOR Colin ah me how I fear  Lest he should rashly venture here  I'm quaking like a timid mouse  My father runs through all the house  Overturning every chair and table  The barn the outhouse and the stable  Across the farmyard in the streets  Threatning every thing he meets  Poor Colin  c  What the deuce can be come to him  If with tears I would subdue him  With anger he directly burns  And raves and scolds and swears by turns  Crying since Eve better nor worse  Women were born to be a curse  Poor Colin  c  Rose  I can't think for the life of me what my father would be at running about soI must get him out some how for if Colin should come and he should see him  SCENE II  ROSE GREGORY  Greg  What are you standing here with your hands before you like a gentlewoman for  Rose  Father I  Greg  Iwellwhy don't you go to work  Rose

vex  ee  Greg  Thou shalt knowbut first let me ask thy advicewe are both widowers you know your wife has left you a son and mine has left me a daughter  Hig  Rose and Colin  Greg  Truebut if thy lot had been to have had the daughter instead of the son and a young impudent dog had come when thou wast in the field or at market or in the barn  Hig  What telling a soft tale in her ear I warrant youwhy I'd tell him says I calling him by his namesays I my child is another guess sort of a child she is not for thee thou art a libertine and if thou com'st here again I shall be angry I shall brush thy jacket  Greg  Well said neighbour Higginsnow hear what I have got to saylast night I had been late cocking the hay and when I come home being a sort of owl light I could just see some thing crawl upon all fours towards the door so taking it sor a dog I gave it a good kickupon this my daughter runs up to me withdear father I'm glad you're come home I'm glad to see you I'm glad no mischief has happened to her I'm glad  imitating her  Hig  So so  Greg  And all this thou see'st that I might not find out what sort of a fourlegged animal it wasbut I'cod I was too cunning for herlooking out of the window I found Mr Dog to be no other than Master Colin your son  Hig  Ah ahThis is the reason he is sighing and flouting about so thenI can't get him of late days to mind any kind of work  Greg  Nor can I my daughter  Hig  What shall we do  Greg  Why truly I don't know  Hig  Suppose we marry them together  Greg  That's truebut suppose this should be only a flighty pack of nonsense that will last but a month  Hig  Try 'em try 'em let us try 'em  Greg  How  Hig  Here comes your daughter seem as if we had quarrelled and forbid me your house then presently come to me that we may counsel together  SCENE V  GREGORY HIGGINS ROSE  Hig  An old doating fool to pretend that I don't know the price of grain  Greg  Call that indeed clear wheat when it has been half eat up by the rats  Rose  Dear me they seem to be quarrellinghere's the ale father will you please to drink neighbour Higgins  Hig  Not II won't taste a drop of his ale  Greg  Put it down daughterput it downhe shan't taste a drop of it was it ever so  Rose  Dear father what's the matter  Greg  In one word get out of my house  Hig  I don't want to stay in itand dy'e mark me never let you or your's come near minean old stupiddoatingnot know the price of corn indeed  SCENE V  GREGORY ROSE  Greg  Go thy ways thou old fooland thou daughter if I ever know thee speak to his sonI am going out and if thou suffer'st that young dog to come lurking about my housesee'st thou this oak saplinhe shall get ithowever for this time the key shall answer for theeas I go out I'll double lock the door  AIR  With neither dog nor scrip nor staff  I rather by half  A flock of sheep would guard  Then a puling wench sighing up and abed  With love in her head  Nor would the task be half so hard  All council's thrown away and lost  Advice is out of season  Nor the devil a bit no more than a post  Can you get her to hear reason  Whining  Pining  Groaning  Moaning  It is her way  Each hour o'th' day  Tell her why  She heaves a sigh  Tell her to disclose her fears  Her answer is a shower of tears  SCENE VI  Rose  Looking through the keyhole  Yonder he goeswhat can be the matterthey were such good friends too'tis a sad thing not to be dutifulbut 'tis a sadder thing not to love Colin  AIR  I lost my poor mother  When only a child  And I fear'd such another  So gentle and mild  Was not to be found  But I saw my mistake  For scarce was she gone  But I prov'd I had father and mother in one  And though at this minute he makes my heart ach  There's not such another search all the world round  II  I'd reach'd my teens fairly  As blythe as a bee  His care late and early  Being all to please me  No one thing above ground  Was too good for his Rose  At wake or at fair  I was dress'd out so gaily lord people would stare  And I say it again though he's peevish God knows  There's not such another search all the world round  III  But love who they tell us  Does many strange things  Makes all the world jealous  And madeven kings  They say he can wound  This love is the sore  Since Colin came here  This father so kind is a father severe  Yet still will I say though he scolds more and more  There's not such another search all the world round  SCENE VII  COLIN ROSE  Colin  knocking at the door  Rose Rose  Rose  Oh dear 'tis him and the door is doublelocked  Colin  Rose open the doorI've watched the old man outwhat the mischief is not she at homelet us see  Rose  I can't open it dear Colinmy father has locked itcome again in the evening he does not hear me sure  looking through the keyhole  dear me he's goneOh how my heart beatsthat I could not speak to him nowhe was in a great hurry to go I thinkOh the wicked rogue there he is climbing up at the windowI'll hide myself and vex him a little in his turn  She hides herself under the stairs and Colin opens the window  Colin  looking in  RoseRoseno there's nobody at home well I'll leave her the posey I brought however  he tries to throw it upon the table and tumbles it upon the ground  The deuce take it I have let it fall upon the ground and ten to one if her father don't trample upon itif I could but get in now I could put it upon the tablehang it I can get in well enough  As he gets in at the window he lets his hat fall  on the outside  Well done Imy hat's tumblednever mindI can pick it up when I go out  He gets down puts the nosegay upon the table and regards the cushion and bobbins with which Rose has been making lace and Rose now and then either shews herself or gets under the staircase as she finds occasion during the following song  AIR  Here's all her geer her wheel her work  These little bobbins to and fro  How oft l've seen her fingers jirk  Her pretty fingers white as snow  Each object to me is so dear  My heart at sight on't throbbing goes  'Twas here she sat her downand here  She told me she was Colin's Rose  II  This posey for her when she's dress'd  I've brought alas how happy I  Could I be like these flowers caress'd  And like them on her bosom die  The violet and pink I took  And every pretty flower that blows  The rose too but how mean 'twill look  When by the side of my sweet Rose  At the end of the song Colin begins climbing up to get out at window which Rose perceiving she throws a skein of flax at him when he turns speaking as he descends  Colin  Ah you rogue youwhat you are there  Rose  Yes dear Colinbut don't come down go away directly  Colin  Nay but dear Rose  Rose  I'll tell thee all at nightpray now go you frighten me out of my wits besides the window opens into Goody Fidget's garden and she's a scandalous old gossip  Colin  Never mind her  Rose  Hearing her father  My father is at the doorI hear him  Colin  Odds wounds I'll get away thenone kiss  Rose  No nomake haste  Colin  He climbs up  How happened it that  the casement is got so fast nowhere he comes I must e'en stay where I am  He rests upon the ledge of the window now and then trying to open the casement and leaving off for fear of making a noise  SCENE VIII  COLIN ROSE GREGORY  Greg  Yes yes 'tis just as I feared 'tis in every body's mouthheyday what's all thisthe spinningwheel in one placethe flax in anothernothing but tidling and tidling of that damned lace'twould be better for you if you'd mind your spinningAh well my comfort is that rogue Colin's far enough off his father has sent him away for three years  Rose smiles to herself but as often as her father looks at her she seems grave  what you pout about it'tis cruel is it notshe shall have her ColinColinthe very name puts me in a passion I'll trim himI'llbut he's gonehe's gone that's my comfort  yawning  come take your wheel and go to your workI have not had my afternoon's napI'll try if I can sleep while you sing  Rose  Do fatherif you don't take your afternoon's nap I am afraid you'll be sick    he  puts the chair on the opposite side and takes her spinningwheel  Greg  Come sing  Rose  What shall I sing fatherthat song about Colin  Greg  Always Colinnothing but Colinsing what you've a mindif I sleep about an hour wake me do you hear  Rose  Yes father  AIR  There was a jolly shepherd lad  And Colin was his name  And all unknown to her old dad  He sometimes to see Peggy came  The object of his flame  One day of his absence too secure  Her father thunder'd at the door  When fearing of his frown  Says she dear love the chimney climb  I can't cries he there is not time  Besides I should tumble down  II  What could they do ta'en unawares  They thought and thought again  In closets underneath the stairs  To hide himself 'twere all in vain  He'd soon be found 'twas plain  Get up the chimn  y love you must  Cried she or else the door he'll burst  I would not for a crown  Young Colin seeing but this shift  E'en mounted up Peg lent a lift  And cry'd don't tumble down  III  With throbbing heart now to the door  Poor Peggy runs in haste  Thinking to trick her father sure  But haste the proverb says makes waste  Which proverb here's wellplac'd  Her father scolded her his best  Call'd names and said among the rest  Pray have you seen that clown  She scarce had time to answer no  When black all over as a crow  Young Colin tumbled down  During the song Colin makes several efforts to open the casement as softly as possible and just at the end of it as Rose repeats the words "tumbled down" for the last time pushing it very hard his foot slips and he tumbles down upon the table carrying with him the bridle and saddle which hang in his way this jolts Gregory almost out of his chair who starts up  Colin  Icod and so I havewhat the deuce Rose put it in your head to sing that song  Greg  What's thatwhat the devil's thatIs the house tumbling downwhat's the matter  Rose  Dear fatherColin  Greg  Who the devil have we got here  Colin  Why 'tis I  Greg  Oh 'tis you you young rascal is itand where did you come fromthrough the roof of the house or down the chimney  Rose  You have not hurt yourself Colin have you  Colin  No Roseyou en't frighten'd I hope are you  Greg  Frighten'd how the devil should she be otherwise coming into my house like a bomb or a cannonballbut you can set all to rightsdon't be frightened Rose 'tis I your dear Colinbut tell me once for all what brought you here  Colin  I comeIIcome neighbour  Greg  I comeIIcomefor what  Colin  To bring you home  Greg  What  Colin  That  Greg  Thatwhat the devil's that  Colin  Why the saddle and bridle you lent father  Greg  Lent fatherwhy you dog I never lent your father a saddle and bridle  Colin  I hope you are pretty well neighbour Gregory and your daughter Rose  Greg  Oh yes yes we are mighty well and now pray get about your business  Colin  Lord farmer Gregory why are you hasty it did not use to be so  AIR  Excuse me pray ye do dear neighbour  But Rose you know and I  Have oft partook one sport or labour  While you have pleas'd stood by  And since from little children playing  You've kindly call'd me son  I thought to Rose I might be saying  "Goodday" and no harm done  II  When you and father gravely counted  One morning in the barn  To how much in a day it 'mounted  That both of us could earn  Since then you down the law were laying  And calling me your son  I thought to Rose I might be saying  "Good day" and no harm done  Greg  Here comes your fatherhe'll tell you why so  SCENE last  GREGORY COLIN HIGGINS ROSE GOODY FIDGIT  Hig  So farmer Goody Fidgit here has a fine story to tell you  Greg  Ay why to what do we owe the sight of her  Goody  Why you owe the sight of me to your own goings onLord Lord that parents nowa days have no more prudenceyou ought to be ashamed of yourselves two men of your ageThou Nicholas Gregory was born the th of January in the year  Greg  Well well we know how old we arego on  Goody  And you have no more grace than to let that forward minx your daughter chatter to that rogue Colin every night out of the window  Rose  Dear dear how can that be when I lie in the next room to my father  Goody  So you do and you get up again and creep down a ladder by the way of the grainery  Colin  Lord lord  Goody  Ah 'tis no secretall the village knows it  Colin  I wish I could catch any body telling me of it I'd have a touch at them  Goody  Well I tell thee of it then now thou may'st have a touch at me if thou wilt  Colin  'Tis a great lie I tell you  Goody  It is is ittell me then what did you knock at that door for but just now when farmer Gregory was out  Colin  What forwhy to come in to be sure  Goody  But you found it locked and so rather than fail you climbed up the wall and jumped into my garden  Colin  That's another lie Goody  Goody  We shall seeI can shew your father the figtree you broke in getting up  Rose  What a wicked old woman you must be  Colin  I tell you 'tis a pack of spight and maliceyou broke the figtree yourself I suppose and now you have a mind to say I did it  Goody  And pray was it I too dropped this hat  shewing the hat she had before hid under her apron  which I found under the window  Greg  Oh ho I am no longer at a loss to know how he came into the house  Colin  Rose  Rose  Colinwhat shall we do  Hig  Get out of the house directly you dog and wait for me at the door  Greg  And do you so to your chamber this minute  Colin goes slowly towards the door regarding Rose who as slowly goes upstairs  Greg  Neighbour Higgins  Hig  Neighbour Gregory  Greg  Shall we try them any longer  Hig  They'll only make fools of us if we do  Greg  Why I believe you are in the rightcome here both of you  They run towards each other  'tis more than you deserve but we forgive you and you young dog if you don't make her a good husband  Colin  Ah neighbour there's no fear of that  Greg  Well we have made good the old proverb at least  VAUDEVILLE  Greg  Never talk of the care of a father  Vain  Pain  And argument poor  Your children make happy much rather  Nor ever the old crabbed Mentor  Attempt to be playing  But think of the saying  Love in at the window will enter  If you shut it out at the door  Rose  II  Never maids should the fit of love seize you  Pine  Whine  But take for a cure  A kind constant youth that can please you  In that will your happiness center  Not Cupid still shunning  For spight of your cunning  He in at the window will enter  If you shut him out at the door  Colin  III  This Cupid sly rogue how he teazes  All  Fall  Plump into his lure  And he makes just whatever he pleases  Of those in his trammels who venture  From a clown up to Pliny  And he was no ninny  Who said at the window he'll enter  If you shut him out at the door  THE END
