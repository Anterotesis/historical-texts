 OBSERVATIONS ON THE MOUNTAINS AND LAKES OF Cumberland and Westmoreland  OBSERVATIONS RELATIVE CHIEFLY TO PICTURESQUE BEAUTY Made in the YEAR On several PARTS of ENGLAND PARTICULARLY THE MOUNTAINS AND LAKES OF CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORELAND  VOL II  By WILLIAM GILPIN M A PREBENDARY OF SALISBURY AND VICAR OF BOLDRE IN NEWFOREST NEAR LYMINGTON  LONDON PRINTED FOR R BLAMIRE STRAND  MDCCLXXXVI  OBSERVATIONS ON Several PARTS of ENGLAND ESPECIALLY The LAKES  c  SECTION XVI  HAVING refreshed ourselves and our horses after a fatiguing morning we proceeded along the vale of Buter∣mer and following the course of the river as far as the inequalities of the ground would admit we soon came to another lake still more beautiful than that we had left above The two lakes bear a great resemblance to each other Both are oblong both wind  round promontories and both are surrounded by mountains But the lower lake is near a mile longer than the upper the lines it forms are much easier and tho it has less wood on it's banks the loss is compensated by a richer display of rocky scenery The forms of these rocks are in general beautiful most of them being broken into grand square surfaces This species as we have already observed  See Page  are in a greater style than the cragg which is shattered into more diminu∣tive parts  With this rocky scenery much hilly ground is intermixed Patches of meadow also here and there on the banks of the lake improve the variety Nothing is wanting but a little more wood to make this lake and the vale in which it lies a very inchanting scene or rather a succession of inchanting scenes for the hills and rising grounds into which it every where swells acting in due subordina∣tion to the grand mountains which inviron the whole vale break and separate the area of it into smaller parts Many of these form  themselves into little vallies and other re∣cesses which are very picturesque  Not far from the lake the mountain of Grasmer appears rising above all the moun∣tains in it's neighbourhood A lake of this name we had already seen in our road between Ambleside and Keswick but there is no connection between the lake and the moun∣tain  This mountain forms rather a vast ridge than a pointed summit and is connected with two or three other mountains of inferior dignity itself is said to be equal to Skiddaw which is the common gage of altitude through the whole country and therefore may be supposed the highest No mountain aspires to be higher than Skiddaw some boast an equal height but two or three only have real pretensions  Grasmer and the mountains in it's neigh∣bourhood form the eastern boundary of the vale which we now traversed a vale at least five miles in length and one third of that space in breadth Our road carried us near  the village of Brackenthwait which lies at the bottom of Grasmer  Here we had an account of an inundation occasioned by the bursting of a waterspout The particulars which are well authenticated are curious But it will be necessary first to exhibit the geography of the mountain  In that part where Grasmer is connected with the other high lands in it's neighbour∣hood three little streams take their origin of which the Lissa is the least inconsiderable The course of this stream down the moun∣tain is very steep and about a mile in length It's bed which is a deep  gully  and the sides of the mountain all around are profusely spread with loose stones and gravel On leaving the mountain the Lissa divides the vale through which we now passed and after a course of four or five miles joins the Cocker  On the th of September about mid∣night the waterspout fell upon Grasmer nearly as was conjectured where the three little streams just mentioned issue from their fountains  At first it swept the whole side of the moun∣tain and charging itself with all the rubbish it found there made it's way into the vale following chiefly the direction of the Lissa At the foot of the mountain it was received by a piece of arable ground on which it's violence first broke Here it tore away trees soil and gravel and laid all bare many feet in depth to the naked rock Over the next ten acres it seems to have made an immense roll covering them with so vast a bed of stones that no human art can ever again restore the soil  When we saw the place tho twelve years after the event many marks remained still flagrant of this scene of ruin We saw the natural bed of the Lissa a mere contracted rivulet and on it's banks the vestiges of a stony channel spreading far and wide almost enough to contain the waters of the Rhine or the Danube It was computed from the floodmarks that in many parts the stream must have been five or six yards deep and near a hundred broad and if it's great velo∣city be added to this weight of water it's moment will be found equal to almost any effect  On the banks of this stony channel we saw a few scattered houses a part of the village of Brackenthwait which had a won∣derful escape They stood at the bottom of Grasmer rather on a rising ground and the current taking it's first direction towards them would have undermined them in a few moments for the soil was instantly laid bare had not a projection of native rock the in∣terior stratum on which the houses had un∣knowingly been founded resisted the current and given it a new direction Unless this had intervened it is probable these houses and all the inhabitants of them so instan∣taneous was the ruin had been swept away together  In passing farther along the vale we saw other marks of the fury of the inundation where bridges had been thrown down houses carried off and woods rooted up But it's effects upon a stonecauseway were thought the most surprizing This fabric was of great thickness and supported on each side by an enormous bank of earth The memory of man could trace it unaltered in any particular near a hundred years but by the soundness and firmness of it's parts and texture it seemed  as if it had stood for ages It was almost a doubt whether it were a work of nature or of art This massy mole the deluge not only carried off but as if it turned it into sport made it's very foundations the channel of it's own stream  Having done all this mischief not only here but in many other parts the Lissa threw all it's waters into the Cocker where an end was put to it's devastation for tho the Cocker was unable to contain so immense an increase yet as it flows through a more level country the deluge spread far and wide and wasted it's strength in one vast stagnant inundation  Having passed through the vale of Buter∣mer we entered another beautiful scene the vale of Lorton  This vale like all the past presents us with a scene intirely new No lakes no rocks are here to blend the ideas of dignity and grandeur with that of beauty All is simplicity and repose Nature in this scene lays totally aside her majestic frown and wears only a lovely smile  The vale of Lorton is of the extended kind running a considerable way between mountains which range at about a mile's distance They are near enough to screen it from the storm and yet not so impending as to exclude the sun Their sides tho not smooth are not much diversified A few knolls and hollows just give a little variety to the broad lights and shades which over∣spread them  This vale which enjoys a rich soil is in general a rural cultivated scene tho in many parts the ground is beautifully broken and abrupt A bright stream which might almost take the name of a river pours along a rocky channel and sparkles down number∣less little cascades It's banks are adorned with wood and varied with different objects a bridge a mill a hamlet a glade overhung with wood or some little sweet recess or natural vista through which the eye ranges between irregular trees along the windings of the stream  Except the mountains nothing in all this scenery is  great  but every part is filled with those sweet engaging passages of nature which  tend to sooth the mind and instill tranquil∣lity  The passions to divine repose  Persuaded yield and love and joy alone  Are waking love and joy such as await  An angel's meditation  Scenes of this kind however pleasing in which few objects occur either of  grandeur  or  peculiarity  in a singular manner elude the powers of verbal description They al∣most elude the power of colours The soft and elegant form of beauty is hard to hit while the strong harsh feature is a mark which every pencil can strike  But tho a  peculiar  difficulty attends the verbal description of these mild and quiet haunts of nature yet undoubtedly  all  her scenery is illattempted in language  Mountains rocks broken ground water and wood are the simple materials which she employs in all her beautiful pictures but the variety and harmony with which she employs them are infinite In description these words stand only for general ideas on her charts each is detailed into a thousand  varied forms Words may give the great outlines of a scene They can measure the dimensions of a lake They can hang it's sides with wood They can rear a castle on some projecting rock or place an island near this or the other shore But their range extends no farther They cannot mark the characteristic distinctions of each scene the touches of natureher living tintsher endless varieties both in form and colour In a word all her elegant peculiarities are beyond their reach Language is equally unable to convey these to the eye as the eye is to convey the various divisions of sound to the ear  The pencil it is true offers a more per∣fect mode of description It speaks a language more intelligible and describes the scene in stronger and more varied terms The shapes and hues of objects it delineates and marks with more exactness It gives the lake the louring shade of tempest or the glowing blush of sunset It spreads a warmer or a colder tint on the tufts of the forest It adds form to the castle and tips it's shattered battlements with lightBut all this all that words can express or even the pencil describe  are gross insipid substitutes of the living scene  This is not at all inconsistent with what is said in the th page  Here  we speak chiefly of the  detail  of nature's works  there  of the  composition  The nearer we approach the character of nature in every mode of imitation no doubt the better yet still there are many irregularities and deformities in the natural scene which we may wish to correctthat is to correct by improving one part of nature by another  We may be pleased with the de∣scription and the picture but the soul can  feel  neither unless the force of our own imagination aid the poet's or the painter's art exalt the idea and  picture things unseen  Hence it perhaps follows that the perfec∣tion of the art of painting is not so much attained by an endeavour to form an exact resemblance of nature in a  nice representation of all her minute parts  which we consider as almost impracticable ending generally in flat∣ness and insipidity as by aiming to give those bold those strong characteristic touches which excite the imagination and lead it to form half the picture itself Painting is the  art of deceiving  and it's great perfection lies in the exercise of this art  Hence it is that genius and knowledge are as requisite in surveying a picture as in  painting one The cold untutored eye tho it may enjoy the  real  scene be it history  Historypainting is certainly the most elevated species Nothing exalts the human mind so much as to see the great actions of our fellowcreatures brought before the eye But this pleasure we seldom find in painting So much is requir∣ed from the historypainter so intimate a knowledge both of nature and art that we rarely see a historypiece even from the best masters that is able to  raise raptures  We may ad∣mire the colouring or the execution or some underpart but the  soul is seldom reached  The imagination soars beyond the picture In the inferior walks of painting where less is required more of course is performed and tho we have few good pictures in history we have many in portrait in landscape in animallife deadgame fruit and flowers History painting is a mode of epic and tho the literary world abounds with admirable productions in the lower walks of poetry an epic is the wonder of an age  landscape or what it will is unmoved at the finest  representation  It does not see an  exact  resemblance of what it sees abroad and having no internal pencil if I may so speak to work within it is utterly unable to  ad∣minister  a picture to itself Whereas the learned eye  The admirers of painting may be divided into two classesThe inferior admirer values himself on  distin∣guishing the master  on knowing the peculiar touch of each pencil and the ruling tint of every pallet But he has no  feeling  If the picture be an  original  or if it be in the master's  best manner  which may be the case of many a bad picture it is the object of his veneration tho the story be illtold the characters feebly marked and a total deficiency appear in every excellence of the art  The more liberal professor and who alone is here consider∣ed as capable of  administring  a picture to himself thinks the knowledge of names any further than as it marks excel∣lence till we get a better criterion is the bane of the art he admires A work worthy of admiration may be produced by an inferior hand and a paltry composition may escape from a master He would have the  intrinsic merit  of a work not any  arbitrary stamp  proclaim it's excellence In examining a picture he leaves the  name  entirely out of the question It may mislead it cannot assist his judgment The characters of nature and the knowledge of art are all he looks for the rest be they Guido's Carrache's or Raphael's he despises as the bubbles of picturedealers the mere sweep∣ings and refuse of Italian garrets  versed equally in nature and  art easily compares the picture with it's archetype and when it finds the characteristic touches of nature the imagination immediately takes fire and glows with a thousand beau∣tiful ideas suggested only by the canvas When the canvas therefore is so artificially wrought as to suggest these ideas in the strongest manner the picture is then most perfect This is generally best done by little  labour and great knowledge It is know∣ledge only which inspires that free that fear∣less and determined pencil so expressive in a skilful hand As to the  minutiae  of nature the picturesque eye will generally suggest them better itself and yet give the artist as he deserves the credit of the whole  We sometimes indeed see pictures  highly finished  and  yet full of spirit  They will bear a nice examination at hand and yet lose nothing of their distant effect But such pic∣tures are so exceedingly rare that I should think few painters would in prudence at∣tempt a laboured manner Indeed as pictures are not designed to be seen through a micros∣cope but at a proper distance it is labour thrown away  In the higher walks of painting I know of no artist who does not lose his spirit in attempting to finish highly In the inferior walks we have a few Among the first we may rank Van Huysum who painted flowers and fruits with equal labour and spirit And yet even here I own I have more pleasure in helping myself to these delicacies from the bolder works of Baptiste    Hence it is that even a rough sketch by the hand of a master will often strike the imagination beyond the most finished work  I have seen the learned eye pass unmoved along rows of pictures by the cold and in∣animate pencil of such a master as Carlo Marat and start astonished when it came to a sketch of Rubens In one case the painter endea∣vouring in vain to administer every thing by giving the full roundness and smoothness to every part instead of the bold characteristic touches of nature had done too much in the other tho the work was left unfinished yet many of the bold characteristic touches being thrown in enough was done to excite the imagination of the spectator which could easily supply the rest  A very ingenious writer  Burke on the sublime and beautiful Part II Sect XI  indeed gives an∣other reason for our being better pleased with a sketch than with a finished piece  The imagination  says he  is entertained with the promise of something more and does not ac∣quiesce in the present object of the sense  But this observation I think is scarce founded on truth It is true  the imagination does not ac∣quiesce in the present object of the sense  but I should suppose not because it is entertained  with a  promise of something more  but because it has the power of  creating something more itself  If  a promise of something more  were the cause of this pleasure it should seem that a sketch in it's rudest form would be more pleasing than when it is more advanced for the imagination must have still  higher  enter∣tainment in proportion to the  largeness  of the promise But this is not the case The sketch in it's naked chalklines affects us little in comparison The instrument must be tuned higher to excite vibrations in the imagination  Again on the same supposition one would imagine that the rude beginning or rough plan of a house would please us more than the compleat pile for  the imagination is enter∣tained with the promise of something more  But I believe no one was ever so well pleased with an unfinished shell amidst all it's rubbish of scaffolding paperwindows and other de∣formities as with a structure compleat in all it's members and set off with all it's proper decorationsBut on the supposition I have ventured to suggest we see why the  sketch  may please beyond the  picture  tho the  unfinished fabric  disappoints An elegant house is a  compleat object  The imagination can rise no higher It receives full satisfaction But a picture is  not an object itself  but only the  representation  of an object We may easily therefore conceive that it may fall below it's archetype and also below the imagination of the spectator whose fancy may be more picturesque than the hand of the artist who composed the picture In this case a sketch may afford the spectator more pleasure as it gives his imagination freer scope and suffers it to compleat the artist's imperfect draught from the fund of it's own richer and more perfect ideas  The variety of scenes which nature ex∣hibits and their infinite combinations and peculiarities to which neither language nor colours unaided by imagination can in any degree do justice gave occasion to these remarks which have carried me perhaps too far into digression  We had to regret that we saw the vale of Lorton only in half it's beauty It was at too late an hour and the evening besides was dark The morning had been cloudy  in some part of it rather tempestuous and we thought ourselves then very happy in the disposition of the weather for as we had before seen the mountains in a clear atmos∣phere it was a desirable variety to see the grand effects they produced in a storm A mountain is an object of grandeur and it's dig∣nity receives new force by mixing with the clouds and arraying itself in the majesty of darkness Here the idea of  infinity  See Page  pro∣duces strongly the sublime But the chearful scenes of such a vale as this pretend not to dignity they are mere scenes of tranquillity The early blush of dawn the noontide shade or eveningglow are the circumstances in which they most rejoice a storm in any shape will injure them Here therefore we might have dispensed with more light and sunshine Or at the close of day we might have wished for a quiet tranquil hour when the glimmering surfaces of things are some∣times perhaps more pleasingat all times certainly more soothing than images of the brightest hue  When through the dusk obscurely seen  Sweet eveningobjects intervene  The evening which grew more tempestu∣ous began to close upon us as we left the more beautiful parts of the vale of Lorton We were still about six miles from Keswick and had before us a very wild country which probably would have afforded no great amuse∣ment even in full day but amid the obscurity which now overspread the landscape the ima∣gination was left at large and painted many images which perhaps did not really exist upon the dead colouring of nature Every great and pleasing form whether clear or obscure which we had seen during the day now played in strong imagery before the fancy as when the grand chorus ceases ideal music vibrates in the ear  In one part a view pleased us much tho perhaps in stronger light it might have escaped notice The road made a sudden dip into a little winding valley which being too abrupt for a carriage was eased by a  bridge and the form of the arch appeared to be what we commonly find in Roman aquaducts The winding road the woody valley and broken ground below the moun∣tain beyond the form of the bridge which gave a classic air to the scene and the ob∣scurity which melted the whole into one harmonious mass made all together a very pleasing view  But it soon grew too dark even for the imagination to roam It was now ten o'clock and tho in this northern climate the twilight of a clear summerevening affords even at that late hour a bright effulgence yet now all was dark  A faint erroneous ray  Glanced from th' imperfect surfaces of things  Threw half an image on the straining eye  While wavering woods and villages and streams  And rocks and mountaintops that long retained  Th' ascending gleam were all one swimming scene  Uncertain if beheld  We could just discern through the dim∣ness of the night the shadowy forms of the mountains sometimes blotting out half the  sky on one side and sometimes winding round as a gloomy barrier on the other  Often too the road would appear to dive into some dark abyss a cataract roaring at the bottom while the mountaintorrents on every side rushed down the hills in notes of various cadence as their quantities of water the declivities of their fall their distances or the intermission of the blast brought the sound fuller or fainter to the ear which organ became now more alert as the imagi∣nation depended rather on it than on the eye for information  These various notes of watermusic an∣swering each other from hill to hill were a kind of translation of that passage in the psalms in which  one deep  is represented  calling another because of the noise of the waterpipes  Among other images of the night a lake for the lake of Bassenthwait was now in view appeared through the uncertainty of the gloom like something of ambiguous tex∣ture spreading a lengthened gleam of wan dead light under the dark shade of the in∣cumbent mountains but whether this light  was owing to vapours arising from the valley or whether it was waterand if water whe∣ther it was an arm of the sea a lake or a riverto the uninformed traveller would ap∣pear matter of great uncertainty Whatever it was it would seem sufficient to alarm his apprehensions and to raise in his fancy now in quest of dangers the idea of something that might stop his farther progress  A good turnpikeroad on which we en∣tered near the village of Lorton and a know∣ledge of the country set at naught all such ideas with us but it may easily be conceived that a traveller wandering in the midst of a stormy night in a mountainous country un∣known and unbeaten by human footsteps might feel palpitations of a very uneasy kind  We have in Ossian some beautiful images which accompany a nightstorm in such a country as this I shall subjoin with a few alterations an extract from them as it will illustrate the subject before us It is con∣tained in a note on  Croma  in which several bards are introduced entertaining their patron with their respective descriptions of the night  The storm gathers on the tops of the moun∣tains and spreads it's black mantle before the moon It comes forward in the majesty of darkness moving upon the wings of the blast It sweeps along the vale and nothing can withstand it's force The lightning from the rifted cloud flashes before it the thunder rolls among the mountains in its rear  All nature is restless and uneasy  The stag lies wakeful on the mountainmoss the hind close by his side She hears the storm roaring through the branches of the trees She startsand lies down again  The heathcock lifts his head at intervals and returns it under his wing  The owl leaves her unfinished dirge and sits ruffled in her feathers in a cleft of the blasted oak  The famished fox shrinks from the storm and seeks the shelter of his den  The hunter alarmed leaps from his pallet in the lonely hut He raises his decaying fire His wet dogs smoke around him He halfopens his cabindoor and looks out but he instantly retreats from the terrors of the night  For now the whole storm descends The mountaintorrents join their impetuous streams The growing river swells  The benighted traveller pauses as he en∣ters the gloomy dell The glaring sky dis∣covers the terrors of the scene With a face of wild despair he looks round He recol∣lects neither the rock above nor the preci∣pice below Still he urges his bewildered way His steed trembles at the frequent flash The thunder bursts over his headThe tor∣rents roar aloudHe attempts the rapid fordHeard you that screamIt was the shriek of death  How tumultuous is the bosom of the lake The waves lash it's rocky sides The boat is brimful in the cove The oars are dashed against the shore  What melancholy shade is that sitting un∣der the tree on the lonely beachI just discern it faintly shadowed out by the pale beam of the moon passing through a thinrobed cloudIt is a female formHer eyes are fixed upon the lake Her dische∣velled hair floats loose around her arm which supports her pensive headAh mourn∣ful  maid dost thou still expect thy lover over the lakeThou sawest his distant boat at the close of day dancing upon the feathery wavesThy breast throbs with suspence but thou knowest not yet that he lies a corpse upon the shore  SECT XVII  AFTER a wet and stormy night we re∣joiced to see the morning arise with all the signs of a calm and splendid day We wished for the opportunity of surveying Ulles∣water in serene bright weather This was the next scene we proposed to visit and with which we intended to close our views of this picturesque country  From Keswick we mounted a hill on the great turnpike road to Penrith At the sum∣mit we left our horses and went to examine a Druid temple in a field on the right The diameter of this circle is thirtytwo  paces  which as nearly as could be judged from so inaccurate a mode of mensuration is the diameter of Stonehenge which I once mea∣sured  in the same way But the structures are very different tho the diameters may be nearly equal The stones here are diminutive in comparison with those on SalisburyPlain If Stonehenge were a cathedral in it's day this circle was little more than a country church  These structures I suppose are by far the most ancient vestiges of architecture if we may call them architecture which we have in England Their rude workmanship hands down the great barbarity of the times of the Druids and furnishes strong proof of the savage nature of the religion of these heathen priests Within these magical circles we may conceive any incantations to have been per∣formed and any rites of superstition to have been celebrated It is history as well as poetry when Ossian mentions the  circles of stones  where our ancestors in their nocturnal orgies invoked the spirits which rode upon the windsthe awful forms of their deceased forefathers through which he sublimely tells us  the stars dimly twinkled  As singular a part as the Druids make in the ancient history not only of Britain but of other countries I know not that I ever saw any of their transactions introduced as the subject of a capital picture That they can furnish a fund of excellent imagery for poetry we know and I see not why the scenes of Caractacus might not be as well suited to picturesque as dramatic representationAnd yet there is a difference The drama depends at least as much on sentiment as on repre∣sentation Whereas the picture depends in∣tirely on the latter The beautiful sentiments of the poet are lost and the spectator must make out the dialogue as he is able from the energetic looks of the figuresHence therefore it follows that the same subjects are not equally calculated to shine in poetry and in painting  Those subjects no doubt are best adapted to the pencil which  tell themselves by action  In general however all animated stories which admit either of  strong action  or  passion  are judiciously chosen Unanimated subjects have little chance of producing an effect parti∣cularly  lovestories which of all others I could wish to exclude from canvas The language of love is so difficult to translate that I know not that I ever saw a represen∣tation of lovers who were not strongly marked with the character of simpletons  But besides such subjects as admit of strong  action  or  passion  there are others of a more inanimate cast which through the peculi∣arity of the characters of which they consist can never be mistaken Such is the settle∣ment of Pensylvania painted by Mr West From the mixture of English and Indian characters and a variety of apposite appen∣dages the story is not only well told but as every picturesque story should be told it is obvious at sight  Among subjects of this kind are those which occasioned this digressiondruidical subjects I know few of the less animated kind which would admit more picturesque embellishment than a Druidsacrifice The peculiar character and savage features of these barbarous prieststheir white flowing vest∣mentsthe branch of misleto which they holdthe circular stones if they could be brought into compositionthe spreading oak  the altar beneath itand the milkwhite steermight all together form a good pic∣ture  I have often admired an etching by Teipolo which I have always conceived to be a repre∣sentation of this subject  It is contained in a book of etchings on emblematical subjects  He does not in∣deed introduce all the circumstances of a Druidsacrifice which I have here enume∣rated but the characters are such as exactly suit the subject and the whole seems to be an excellent illustration of it  After we left the temple of the Druids we met with little which engaged our attention till we came to the  vale of St John  This scene appeared from the stand where we viewed it to be a circular area of about six or seven miles in circumference It is sur∣rounded intirely by mountains and is watered by a small river called the Grata  The vale of St John is esteemed one of the most celebrated scenes of beauty in the country but  it did not answer our expectation The ground consisting of patches of fenced meadow adorn∣ed with farmhouses and clumps of trees was beautifully tumbled about in many parts but the whole was rather rich than pictu∣resque and on this account I suppose it hath obtained it's celebrity It's circular form every where within the scope of the eye wanted that variety which the  winding  vale affords where one part is continually rece∣ding from another in all the pleasing grada∣tions of perspective  See the same idea applied to water page    The  kind  of scenery here is much the same as in the vale of Lorton both are composed of rural objects but these objects are differently presented In the vale of Lor∣ton the houses and hamlets seated on a wandering stream are confined to the same level and appear of course  one after another  as so many little  separate scenes  Here they are scattered about the inequalities of the ground through the area of a vale circular at least in appearance and offer the eye too much at oncea  confusion  rather than a  suc∣cession  of scenery I speak however only of the  general appearance  of the vale it contains undoubtedly many beautiful scenes if we had had time to explore them  The plan or groundplot of the vale of Tempe was somewhat similar to this of St John Nature seems in both to have wrought on the same model excepting only that the furniture of that very celebrated scene of an∣tiquity was more picturesque  The vale of Tempe like this was circular and incompassed with mountains But it's area was composed of level lawns at least we suppose not rising uniformly before the eye interspersed with wood which in many parts was thick and close and must every where have intercepted some portion of the mountainline and broken the regularity of a circular  shape  The mountains too in Tempe were of a more beautiful structure abrupt hung with rock and finely adorned with woodAt the head of the vale was a grand rocky chasm shaded with a profusion of woody scenery through which the whole weight of  the river Peneus forced it's way with a tre∣mendous sound and having been dashed into foam and vapours by the fall reunited it's strength at the bottom and poured through the vale in a wild impetuous torrent roaring over rocks and shelves till it found an exit through the folding of the mountains on the opposite side  Elian indeed tells us that the stream was smooth but as Ovid's description is more picturesque the reader will give me leave to consider his authority as more decisive His view of Tempe is very noble but as he meant principally to describe the palace of a river god which lay among the caverns and re∣cesses of the rocky chasm at the entrance of the vale his subject naturally led him to dwell chiefly on the cascade which was undoubtedly the greatest ornament of the place  Est nemus Aemoniae praerupta quod undique claudit  Silva vocant Tempe per quae Peneus ab imo  Effusus Pindo spumosis volvitur undis  Dejectuque gravi tenues agitantia fumos  Nubila conducit summasque aspergine silvas  Impluit sonitu plus quam vicina fatigat  Haec domus hae sedes haec sunt penetralia magni  Amnis in hoc residens facto de cautibus antro  Undis jura dabat  A vale thus circumstanced is so pleasing that other poets have seized the idea in their descriptions I could multiply quotations but I shall select two in which the same subject is treated in a different manner In one the natural grandeur of the scene is soft∣ened by little circumstances of chearfulness in the other it strikes in the full majesty of the sublime The former is more the vale of St John the latter approaches nearer the idea of the Thessalian vale  Into a forest far they thence him led  Where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade  With mountains round about invironed  And mighty woods that did the valley shade  And like a stately theatre it made  Spreading itself into a spacious plain  And in the midst a little river played  Amongst the pumy stones which seemed to plain  With gentle murmur that his course they did restrain  The hills  Of Aeta yielding to a fruitful vale  Within their range halfcircling had inclosed  A fair expanse in verdure smooth The bounds  Were edged by wood o'erhung by hoary cliffs  Which from the clouds bent frowning Down a rock  Above the loftiest summit of the grove  A tumbling torrent wore the shagged stone  Then gleaming through the intervals of shade  Attained the valley where the level stream  Diffused refreshment  The vale of St John was some years ago the scene of one of those terrible inun∣dations which wasted lately the vale of Brack∣enthwait I shall relate the circumstances of it as they were given to me on the spot but as we had them not perhaps on the best au∣thority they may in some particulars be overcharged  It was on the d of August that this disaster happened That day which had been preceded by weather uncommonly close and sultry set in with a gloomy aspect The blackness gathered more and more from every quarter The air was hot beyond suf∣ferance The whole atmosphere and every thing around was in a state of perfect stag∣nation Not a leaf was in motion  In the mean time the inhabitants of the vale heard a strange noise in various parts around them but whether it was in the air or whether it arose from the mountains they could not ascertain It was like the hollow  murmur of a rising wind among the tops of trees This noise which in a smaller degree is not an uncommon prelude to a storm continued without intermission about two hours when a tempest of wind and rain and thunder and lightning succeeded which was violent beyond any thing remembered in former times and lasted without pause near three hours  During this storm the cataract fell upon the mountain on the north of the vale or as some people thought tho I should sup∣pose without any probability burst from the bowels of it The side of that mountain is a continued precipice through the space of a mile This whole tract we were told was covered in an instant with one conti∣nuous cascade of roaring torrent an appearance which must have equalled the fall of Niagara sweeping all before it from the top of the mountain to the bottom There like that other inundation it followed the channel of the brooks it met with and shewed similar effects of it's fury  One of these effects was astonishing The fragments of rock and deluges of stone and sand which were swept from the mountain  by the torrent choked one of the streams which received it at the bottom The water thus pent up and receiving continually vast accession of strength after rolling sullenly about that part of the vale in frightful whirl∣pools at length forced a new channel through a solid rock which we were informed it disjointed in some fractured crevice and made a chasm at least ten feet wide Many of the fragments were carried to a great distance and some of them were so large that a dozen horses could scarce move them We were sorry afterwards that we had not seen this remarkable chasm but we had not time to go in quest of it  From the vale of St John we ascended a steep hill called Branthwaitcragg where being obliged to leave the great road in our way to Ulleswater and investigate a pathless desert over the mountains which invironed us we put ourselves under the conduct of a guide  These mountains were covered with a pro∣fusion of huge stones and detached rocks among which we found many old people  and children from the neighbouring villages gathering a species of white lychen that grows upon the craggs and which we heard had been found very useful in dying a mur∣raycolour  Among the difficulties of our rout over these mountains the bogs and morasses we met with were the most troublesome We were often obliged to dismount and in some parts the surface could hardly bear a man Where rushes grew our guide informed us the ground was firmest We endeavoured therefore as much as possible to make the little tussocks of these plants the basis of our footsteps But as we could not convey this intelligence to our horses they often plunged very deep  In several parts of our ride we had a view of that grand cluster of mountains which forms a circle in the heart of Cumberland and makes a back ground to the central views from almost every part of the extremities of that county These mountains unite on the south with those of Westmoreland The side next us was composed of SkiddawThrelkatefell  a part of which is called Saddleback and Grisedalefell As we rode nearer the northern limit of this chain Skiddaw which is by much the highest mountain appeared in perspective the least Behind these moun∣tains arise in order MosedalefellCarric and Caudbeckthe tops of which we some∣times saw from the higher grounds peering in their blue attire over the concave parts of the browner mountains which stood nearer the eye  Between us and this circular chain which occupied the whole horizon on the left was spread a very extensive vale stretching from side to side hardly less than seven or eight miles and in length winding out of sight It is a scene of little beauty except what arises from the gradation of distance but it suggests an idea of greatness which space and grand boundaries however unadorned will always suggest  This idea hath sometimes misled the tastless improver of little scenes He has heard that  space gives beauty  but not knowing how to accommodate the rule to circumstances he  often shews all that is to be seen when in fact he should have hid half of it as a deformity  Mere  space gives the idea of  grandeur  rather than of  beauty  Such an idea the ocean presents But a  little  scene cannot present it  Grandeur  therefore is not attained by attempting it while  beauty  is often lost  Along this vale ran the great road we had just left which was no little ornament to it The mazy course of a river is a still nobler object of the same kind but a great road is no bad substitute and is in some respects superior The  river  being on a level and contained within banks is generally too much hid unless it be viewed from an ele∣vated point but the  road  following the ine∣qualities of the ground is easily traced by the eye as it winds along the several eleva∣tions and depressions it meets with and has therefore more variety in it's course  On the right forming the other side of this extensive vale arise several very high  mountains among which Haraside and Whitepike are the most magnificent At the bottom of these verging towards the skirts of the vale are other hills less formidable but two of them called the Mellfells are very remarkable being shaped like earthen graves in a country churchyard  A little before we approached the Mellfells the path we pursued led us under a towering rocky hill which is known by the name of  Wolf'scragg  and is probably one of the monuments of this animal remaining in Britain It is a fortress intirely adapted to a garrison of wolves from whence they might plunder the vale which was spread before them and make prey of every thing as far as the eye could reach Such a scene in painting would be highly characterized by such appendages It would have pleased Ridinger If that picturesque naturalist had been in quest of a wolfscene he could not have found a better  When we had passed this range of moun∣tains we got more into a beaten path lead∣ing to the village of Matterdale about a mile only from Ulleswater which was still intirely excluded from our sight by high grounds Here we dismissed our guide and were directed into Gobraypark which is the northern boundary of the lake  This part of the country we found well inhabited and the roads at this season much frequented It was about the time of a statutefair when the young people of the country leave their old services and go to their new and we were not a little en∣tertained with the simplicity and variety of the several groups and figures we met both on horseback and on foot  These are the picturesque inhabitants of a landscape The dressedout figures and gaudy carriages along the great roads of the capital afford them not The pencil rejects with indignation the splendor of art In grand scenes even the peasant cannot be admitted  if he be employed in the low occupations of his profession the spade the scythe and the rake are all excluded  Moral and picturesque ideas do not al∣ways coincide In a moral light cultivation in all it's parts is pleasing the hedge and the furrow the waving corn field and the ripened sheaf But all these the picturesque eye in quest of scenes of grandeur and beauty looks at with disgust It ranges after nature untamed by art and bursting wildly into all it's irregular forms  Juvat arva videre  Non rastris hominum non ulli obnoxia curae  It is thus also in the introduction of figures In a moral view the industrious mechanic is a more pleasing object than the loitering peasant But in a picturesque light it is otherwise The arts of industry are rejected and even idleness if I may so speak adds dignity to a character Thus the lazy cow∣herd resting on his pole or the peasant lol∣ling on a rock may be allowed in the grandest scenes while the laborious mechanic with his impliments of labour would be repulsed  The fisherman it is true may follow his calling upon the lake but he is indebted for this privilege not to his art but to the picturesque apparatus of ithis boat and his nets which qualify his art  They  are the objects  he  is but an appendage Place him on the shore as a single figure with his rod and line and his art would ruin him In a chearful glade along a purling brook near some mill or cottage let him angle if he please in such a scene the picturesque eye takes no offence But let him take care not to introduce the vulgarity of his employment in a scene of grandeur  At the same time we must observe that figures which thus take their importance merely from not mixing with low mechanic arts are at best only  picturesque appendages  They are of a negative nature neither adding to the grandeur of the idea nor taking from it They merely and simply  adorn  a scene  The characters which are most  suited to these scenes  of grandeur are such as impress us with some idea of greatness wildness or ferocity all which touch on the sublime  Figures in long folding draperies gypsies banditti and soldiersnot in modern regi∣mentals but as Virgil paints them  longis adnixi hastis et scuta tenentes  are all marked with one or other of these characters and mixing with the magnificence wildness or horror of the place they pro∣perly coalesce and reflecting the same images add a deeper tinge to the character of the scene  For the truth of all these remarks I might appeal to the decisive judgment of Salvator Rosa who seems to have thoroughly studied propriety in figures especially in scenes of grandeur His works are a model on this head We have a book of figures particu∣larly composed for scenery of this kind and etched by himself In this collection there is great variety both in the characters groups and dresses but I do not remember either there or in any other of his works a low mechanic character All his figures are either of what I have called the  negative  kind or marked with some trait of  greatness wild∣ness  or  ferocity  Of this last species his  figures generally partook his grand scenes being inhabited chiefly by banditti  I met with a passage not a little illustra∣tive of these remarks on figures in the tra∣vels of Mr Thickness through Spain  "The worst sort of beggars says he in Spain are the troops of male and female gypsies They are of the genuine breed and differ widely from all other gypsies and I may say from all other human beings I often met troops of these people and when an interview happens in roads very distant from towns or dwellings it is not very plea∣sing for they ask as if they knew they were not to be refused and I dare say often com∣mit murders when they can commit them by surprize They are extremely swarthy with hair as black as jet and form very pic∣turesque groups under the shade of the rocks and trees of the Pyraenean mountains where they spend their evenings and live suitably to the climate where bread and water and idleness are preferable to better fare and hardlabour"  SECT XVIII  ON descending the hill from Matterdale before we came to the lake we had a beautiful  specimen  as the naturalists speak of what in this country is called a  gill  The road carried us along the edge of one of it's precipices but the chasm was so intirely filled with wood that when we looked down we could not see into it Even the sunbeams unable to enter rested only on the tufted foliage of the trees which grew from the sidesBut though the eye was excluded the ear was soothed by the harmony of an invisible torrent whose notes sounding along innu∣merable broken falls and softened by ascending through the trees were very melodious  A winding road brought us to the bottom where the torrent tumbling out of the wood received us We had a short view into the  deep recesses of the scene through the branches of the trees which stretched over the stream but we had not time to penetrate the alluring shade  Having passed over more high grounds we came at length in view of the lake The first catch of it was thus presented  A road occupied the nearest part of the landscape winding around a broken cliff which rose considerably on the left A portion of a distant mountain appeared on the right with a small part of the lake at it's foot The foreground was welldisposed and the distant mountain which fell into the lake beautifully tinted The composition as far as it went was very correct but we yet saw only enough to excite our curiosity and to give us from the bearing of the land a general idea of the lake  Ulleswater is the largest lake in this coun∣try except Windermere being eight miles long and about two broad in the widest part tho in general it rarely exceeds a mile in  breadth It points nearly north and south as most of these lakes do but being placed at an  extremity  of the barriermountains it af∣fords a greater variety than is exhibited by such lakes as are  invironed  by them These hav∣ing few accompaniments receive their character chiefly from the surrounding desolation Such a lake is Wyburn Windermere on the other hand Keswick Butermer and Ulles∣water may all be called  boundarylakes  One end of each participates more of the rugged country and the other of the cultivated tho each end participates in some degree of both A few traits of romantic scenery are added to the tameness of one end and the native horror of the other is softened by a few chearful appendages  The form of Ulleswater resembles a Z only there is no angular acuteness in it's line It spreads every where in an easy curve beau∣tifully broken in some parts by promontories The middle reach contains in length near two thirds of the lake The southern side is mountainous and becomes more so as it verges towards the west As the mountains approach the north they glide as we have seen is usual in  boundarylakes  into meadows  and pastures The northern and western sides contain a great variety of woody and rocky scenes but these also as they approach the east become smooth and fertilized At the southern point under impending mountains lies the village of PatterdaleWith this ge∣neral idea of Ulleswater let us return to the descent from Matterdale where we caught the first view of it  As we descended a little further the whole scene of the lake opened before us and such a scene as almost drew from us the apostrophe of the inraptured bard  Visions of glory spare my aching sight  Among all the  visions  of this inchanting country we had seen nothing so beautifully sublime so correctly picturesque as this And yet I am averse to make comparisons especially on seeing a country but once Much depends on the circumstances of light and weather I would wish therefore only to say that I was  more pleased  with Ulleswater than with any lake I had seen adding at the same time that we were fortunate in a concurrence  of incidents that aided it's beauty We had hitherto seen all the lakes we had visited under a rough or cloudy sky and tho their dignity was certainly increased by that circumstance yet the beauty of a lake in splendid serene weather aided at this time by the powers of contrast made a wonderful impression on the imagination  "The effect of the  sublime  Mr Burke in∣forms us is  astonishment  and the effect of  beauty  is  pleasure  but when the two ingre∣dients mix the effect he says is in a good measure destroyed in both They constitute a species something different both from the sub∣lime and beautiful which I have before called  fine  but this kind I imagine has not such a power on the passions either as vast bodies have which are endowed with the correspond∣ent qualities of the sublime or as the qualities of beauty have when united in a small object The affection produced by large bodies adorned with the spoils of beauty is a tention conti∣nually  relieved which approaches to the nature of mediocrity  Sublime and beautiful part IV sect  "  This refined reasoning does not seem intirely grounded on experienceI do not remember any scene in which beauty and sublimity ac∣cording to my ideas are more blended than in this and tho Mr Burke's ideas of beauty are perhaps more exceptionable than his ideas of the sublime yet it happens that most of the qualities which he predicates of both unite also in this scene Their effect therefore according to his argument should be destroyed But the feelings of every lover of nature on viewing these scenes I dare be bold to say would revolt from such reasoning  The foreground of the grand view before us is a part of Gobraypark which belongs to the duke of Norfolk rough broken and woody Among the old oaks which inriched it herds of deer and cattle grazed in groups Beyond this is spread an extensive reach of the lake winding round a rocky promontory on the left  which is the point of a mountain called Mar∣tindalefell or Placefell the southern boun∣dary of the lake This promontory uniting with the mountain lets it easily down into the water as by a step An  hesitation  if I may so call it of this kind eases greatly the heaviness of a line In a  distance  it is of less consequence but in all the  nearer  grounds it is necessary I speak chiefly however of those scenes in which beauty and grandeur are combined In those of simple grandeur and sublimity as in that of Penmanmaur for instance in north Wales the heavy line which is very remarkable in that scene per∣haps strengthens the effect  Martindalefell is intirely unplanted but it's line and surface are both well varied Num∣berless breaks little vallies and knolls give it a lightness without injuring it's simplicity  Such was the disposition of the objects on the left of the lake on the right two woody promontories pursuing each other in perspec∣tive made a beautiful contrast with the smooth continuity of Martindalefell  In front the distance was composed of mountains falling gently into the lake near  the edge of which lies the village of Patter∣dale  We took this view at a point which had just so much elevation as to give a variety to the lines of the lake As we descended to the water the view was still grand and beautiful but had lost some of it's more picturesque beauties it had lost the foreground it had lost the sweeping line round the mountain on the left and it had lost the recess between the two woody promontories on the right The whole margin of the lake was nearly reduced to one straight lineThe beauty of a view especially in lakescenery we have be∣fore observed  See page Vol I  depends greatly on the nice position of it's point  Having spent some time in examining this very inchanting scene we skirted the lake towards Patterdale on a tolerable road which runs from one end of it to the other on the south it is continued to Ambleside on the north to Penrith I call it a tolerable road but I mean only for horses It has not the  quartering and commodious width of a car∣riage road  As we lest Gobraypark we took our rout along the margin of the first of those woody promontories on the right We were carried by the side of the lake through close lanes and thick groves yet not so thick but that we had every where through the openings of the trees and windings of the road views in front and on the right into woody re∣cesses some of which were very pleasing and on the left the lake and all it's distant furniture broke frequently upon us  After skirting the first wooded promontory which carried us about a mile the road turned suddenly to the right and led us round into the second rising a considerable height above the waterIn this promontory a new scene opened the woods became intermixed with rock and a great variety of very beautiful foregrounds were produced The rocks through which the road was sometimes cut were chiefly on our rightIn this promon∣tory  also as well as in the other we were amused with catches of the lake and of Mar∣tindalefell through the trees  Scenes like these are adapted to every state of the sky They were beautiful in the calm season in which we saw them and in which indeed we wished to see them But they would have received peculiar advantages also from a storm The objects are all in that great style which is suited to the vio∣lences of nature The imagination would have risen with the tempest and given a double grandeur to every awful formThe trees in the mean time which rear them∣selves stage above stage upon the moun∣tain's brow and spread down to the very road would have made a noble instrument for the hollow blast to sound consisting of various notes while the surges of the lake resounding among the caverns and dashing against the rocks many fathoms below would have aided the concert with new notes of ter∣rific harmony  There is a mood  I sing not to the vacant and the young  There is a kindly mood of melancholy  That wings the soul and points her to the sky  While winds and tempests sweep the various lyre  How sweet the diapason  The mind is not always indeed in unison with such scenes and circumstances as these When it does not happen to be so no effect can be produced Sometimes indeed the scene may draw the mind into unison if it be not under the impression of any strong passion of an opposite kind but in a sort of neutral state The effect however will always be strongest when the mind happens to be pos∣sessed of ideas congenial to the scenewhen in a  kindly mood of melancholy  it feels itself soothed by the objects around  But besides the music of winds and tem∣pests the ecchoes which are excited in dif∣ferent parts of this lake are still more grand and affecting More or less they accompany all lakes that are circumscribed by lofty and rocky screens We found them on Winder∣mere we found them on Derwentwater But  every lake being surrounded by rocks and mountains of a structure peculiar to itself forms a variety of instru  and of course a variety of sounds The ecchoes therefore of no two lakes are alike unless they are mere monotonists  We took notice of a very grand eccho on the western shores of the great island in Win∣dermere but the most celebrated ecchoes are said to be found on Ulleswater in some of which the sound of a cannon is distinctly reverberated six or seven times It first rolls over the head in one vast pealThen sub∣siding a few seconds it rises again in a grand interrupted burst perhaps on the right Another solemn pause ensues Then the sound arises again on the leftThus thrown from rock to rock in a sort of aerial perspective it is caught again perhaps by some nearer promontory and returning full on the ear surprizes you after you thought all had been over with as great a peal as at first  But the grandest effect of this kind is pro∣duced by a  successive  discharge of cannon  The duke of Portland who has property in this neigh∣bourhood has a vessel on the lake with brass guns for the purpose of exciting ecchoes    at the interval of a few seconds between each discharge The effect of the first is not over when the ecchoes of the second the third or perhaps of the fourth begin Such a va∣riety of awful sounds mixing and commix∣ing and at the same moment heard from all sides have a wonderful effect on the mind as if the very foundations of every rock on the lake were giving way and the whole scene from some strange convulsion were falling into general ruin  These sounds which are all of the terrific kind are suited chiefly to scenes of grandeur during some moment of wildness when the lake is under the agitation of a storm In a calm still evening the gradations of an eccho dying away in distant thunder are certainly heard with most advantage But that is a different idea You attend then only to the  ecchoes  themselves When you take the  scene  into the combination and attend to the effect of the  whole together  no doubt such sounds as are of the most violent kind are best suited to moments of the greatest uproar  But there is another species of ecchoes which are as well adapted to the lake in all it's stillness and tranquillity as the others  are to it's wildness and confusion and which recommend themselves chiefly to those feel∣ings which depend on the gentler move∣ments of the mind Instead of cannon let a few Frenchhorns and clarionets be intro∣duced Softer music than such loud windinstruments would scarce have power to vi∣brate The effect is now wonderfully changed The sound of a cannon is heard in bursts It is the music only of thunder But the  continuation  of  musical sounds  forms a  continua∣tion  of  musical ecchoes  which reverberating around the lake are exquisitely melodious in their several gradations and form a thousand symphonies playing together from every part The variety of notes is inconceivable The ear is not equal to their innumerable combi∣nations It listens to a symphony dying away at a distance when other melodious sounds arise close at hand These have scarce attracted the attention when a different mode of harmony arises from another quarter In short every rock is vocal and the whole lake is transformed into a kind of magical scene in which every promontory seems peopled by aerial beings answering each other in celestial music  How often from the steep  Of ecchoing hill or thicket have we heard  Celestial voices to the midnight air  Sole or responsive each to other's note  Singing their great Creator Oft in bands  While they keep watch or nightly rounding walk  With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds  In full harmonic number joined their songs  Divide the night and lift our thoughts to heaven  We had now almost skirted the two woody promontories in our rout to Patterdale The conclusion is the grandest part of the whole scenery It is a bold projection of rock finely marked and adorned with hanging woods under the beetling summit of which the road makes a sudden turn This is the point of the second promontory and I be∣lieve is known by the name of  Stibraycragg  The trees which compose the whole sce∣nery through both these promontories are in general oak  From hence through lanes of the same kind though less superbly decorated we came to the village of Patterdale situated on rising grounds among two or three little  rivers or branches of a river which feed the lake It lies in a cove of mountains open in front to the southern reach of the lake beyond which appear the high and woody lands of Gobraypark The situation is magnificent  Among the cottages of this village there is a house belonging to a person of some∣what better condition whose little estate which he occupies himself lies in the neigh∣bourhood As his property inconsiderable as it is is better than that of any of his neighbours it has gained him the title of  King of Patterdale  in which his family name is lost His ancestors have long enjoyed the title before him We had the honour of seeing this prince as he took the diversion of fishing on the lake and I could not help thinking that if I were inclined to envy the situation of any potentate in Europe it would be that of the king of Patterdale The pride of Windsor and Versailles would shrink in a comparison with the magnificence of his do∣minions  The great simplicity of this country and that rigid temperance and economy which necessity injoins to all it's inhabitants may be exemplified by the following little history  A clergyman of the name of Mattison was minister of this place sixty years and died lately at the age of ninety During the early part of his life his benefice brought him in only twelve pounds a year It was afterwards increased I suppose by the queen's bounty to eighteen which it never ex∣ceeded On this income he marriedbrought up four childrenlived comfortably among his neighbourseducated a son I believe at collegeand left upwards of £ be∣hind him  With that singular simplicity and inatten∣tion to forms which characterize a country like this he himself read the burialservice over his mother he married his father to a second wife and afterwards buried him also He published his own banns of mar∣riage in the church with a woman whom he had formerly christened and himself mar∣ried all his four children  From this specimen the manners of the country may easily be conceived At a dis∣tance from the refinements of the age they are at a distance also from it's vices Many sage writers and Montesquieu  Book XVIII Ch II  in particular have supposed these rough scenes of nature to have a great effect on the human mind and have found virtues in mountainous coun∣tries which were not the growth of tamer regions Many opinions perhaps have passed current among mankind which have less foundation in truth Montesquieu is in quest chiefly of political virtuelibertybravery and the arts of bold defence but I believe private virtue is equally befriended by these rough scenes It is some happiness indeed to these people that they have no great roads among them and that their simple villages on the sides of lakes and mountains are in no line of communication with any of the busy haunts of men Ignorance is sometimes called the mother of vice I apprehend it to be as often the nurse of innocence  Much have those travellers to answer for whose casual intercourse with this innocent and simple people tends to corrupt them disseminating among them ideas of extrava∣gance and dissipationgiving them a taste for pleasures and gratifications of which they had no ideasinspiring them with dis∣content at homeand tainting their rough industrious manners with idleness and a thirst after dishonest means  If travellers would frequent this country with a view to examine it's grandeur and beautyor to explore it's varied and curious regions with the eye of philosophyor if that could be hoped to adore the great Crea∣tor in these his sublimer worksif in their passage through it they could be content with such fare as the country produces or at least reconcile themselves to it by manly exercise and fatigue for there is a time when the stomach and the plainest food will be found in perfect harmonyif they could thus instead of corrupting the manners of an innocent people learn to amend their own  by seeing in how narrow a compass the wants of human life may be compresseda journey through these wild scenes might be attended perhaps with more improvement than a jour∣ney to Rome or Paris Where manners are polished into vicious refinement simplifying is the best mode of improving and the ex∣ample of innocence is a more instructive lesson than any that can be taught by artists and literati  But these scenes are too often the resort of gay company who are under no impressions of this kindwho have no ideas but of ex∣tending the sphere of their amusementsor of varying a life of dissipation The grandeur of the country is not taken into the ques∣tion or at least it is no otherwise considered than as affording some new mode of plea∣surable enjoyment Thus even the diversions of Newmarket are introduceddiversions one would imagine more foreign to the na∣ture of this country than any other A number of horses are carried into the middle of a lake in a flat boat A plug is drawn from the bottom the boat sinks and the horses are left floating on the surface In dif∣ferent  directions they make to land and the horse which soonest arrives secures the prize  Strenua nos exercet inertia navibus atque  Quadrigis petimus bene vivere Quod petis hic est  Est Ulubris animus si te non deficit aequus  SECT XIX  HAVING spent two hours at Patterdale in refreshing our horses and in survey∣ing the beauty of it's situation we left it with regret and set out for Penrith  We had now the whole length of the lake to skirt part of which we had already tra∣versed in our rout from Gobraypark but we felt no reluctance at taking a second view of it  As we traversed the two woody promon∣tories which we had passed in the morning we had a grand exhibition of the middle reach of the lake which I have observed is by far the longest Martindalefell shooting into the water which before adorned the left  of the landscape now took it's station on the right The left was composed of the high woody grounds about GobrayparkIn the center the hills gently declining formed a boundary at the bottom of the lake stretching far to the eastAs a foreground we had the woods and rocks of the two promontories through which we passed  Such were the outlines and composition of the view before us but it's colouring was still more exquisite  The sun was now descending low and cast the broad shades of evening athwart the land∣scape while his beams gleaming with yellow lustre through the vallies spread over the inlightened summits of the mountains a thou∣sand lovely tintsin sober harmony where some deep recess was faintly shadowedin splendid hue where jutting knolls or pro∣montories received the fuller radiance of the diverging ray The air was still the lake one vast expanse of crystal mirror The mountainshadows which sometimes give the water a deep black hue in many circumstan∣ces extremely picturesque were softened here  into a mild blue tint which swept over half the surface The other half received the fair impression of every radiant form that glowed around The inverted landscape was touched in fainter colours than the real one Yet it it was more than  laid in  It was almost finished The last touches alone were want∣ing  What an admirable study for the pallet is such a scene as this infinitely beyond the camera's contracted bounds Here you see nature in her full dimensions You are let into the very mysteryinto every artifice of her pencil In the  reflected picture  you see the  ground she lays in  the great effects pre∣servedand that veil of expressive obscurity thrown over all in which what is done is done so exquisitely that if you wish the  finish∣ing touches  you wish them only by the same inimitable hand that gave the sketch Turn from the shadow to the reality and you have them There the obscurity is detailed The picture and the sketch reflect mutual graces on each other  I dwell the longer on this scene because during five days which we spent in this ro∣mantic country where we took a view of so  many lakes this was the only moment in which we were so fortunate as to see the water in a  pure  reflecting state Partial ex∣hibitions of this kind we had often met with but here we were presented with a scene of the utmost magnificence  Having examined this very lovely landscape so perfect both in composition and in colour∣ing we proceeded in our rout along the lake  We now reentered Gobraypark which afforded us for near three miles a great va∣riety of beautiful scenes on the left composed of rocky and brokenground foresttrees copsewood and woodedhills while the lake and mountains whose summits were now glowing with the full splendor of an evening sun were a continued fund of varied entertainment on the right The eye was both amused and relieved by surveying the two different modes of scenery in succession the broad shades and bright diversified tints of the distant mountains on one side and the beautiful forms and objects of the foreground on the other  One part of the foreground was marked with singular wildness It was a kind of rocky pass near the margin of the lake known I believe by the name of  Yewcragg  If Caesar had seen it it would have struck him in a military light and he would have described it as a defile "angustum dif∣ficile inter montem lacum quo vix singuli carri ducerentur Mons altissimus impendebat ut facile perpauci transitum pro∣hibere possent  Caes Com lib  "  But our imaginations were more amused with picturesque than military ideas It struck us therefore merely as an object of beautyIt's features were these  At a little distance from the lake the broken side of a mountain falls abruptly to the ground in two noble tiers of rock both which are shattered in every direction This rocky scene was ornamented in the richest manner with wood The road skirted the lake and between it and the rocks all was rough brokenground intangled with brakes and impassible Among the rocks arose a grove of foresttrees  of various height according to the inequality of the ground Here and there a few scat∣tered oaks the fathers of the forest reared their peeled and withered trunks across the glade and set off the vivid green of the more luxuriant trees The deer starting from the brakes as the feet of our horses approached added new wildness to the native character of the view while the screams of a hernery the wildest notes in nature allowed the ear to participate in the scene  The illumination of this grand mass of rock was as interesting as the composition of it It was overspread when we saw it with a deep eveningshadow with many a darker tint in the closer recesses A mild ray just tinged with the blush of a setting sun tipped the summits of the trees  While rushing through the branches rifted cliffs  Dart their  white  heads and  glitter  through the  gloom  Were a man disposed to turn hermit I know not where he could fix his abode more agree∣ably than here The projecting rocks would  afford a sheltered situation for his cell which would open to a scene every way fitted for meditation He might wander along the bot∣tom of a mountain and by the side of a lake almost unfrequented except by the foot of curiosity or of some hasty shepherd seeking for the stragglers of his flock Here he might enjoy the contemplation of nature in all her simplicity and grandeur This single scene the mere invirons of his cell under all the varieties of light and shadesunshine and stormmorning and evening would itself afford an inexhausted fund of entertainment while the ample tome expanded daily before his eye would banish the littleness of life and naturally impress his mind with great ideas  From this wild scene we soon entered ano∣ther of a different cast It was a circular plain about half a mile in diameter sur∣rounded by mountains with an opening to the lake The plain was smooth but varied the mountains rather low but rugged  A valley like this considered as a  whole  has little picturesque beauty But a pictu∣resque eye will find it's objects even here It will investigate the hills and pick out such portions as are most pleasing These it will form into backgrounds and inrich the foreground which can only be a plain with cattle trees or other objectsEven such simple scenes by the aid of judicious lights may form pictures  We had the same kind of scene soon after repeateda circular valley surrounded with mountains tho varied in many particulars from the other Both however were equally unadorned and as both were capable by a few wellchosen accompaniments of being formed into good pictures so likewise both were capable of being made delightful scenes in nature by a little judicious planting tho we must still have wished this planting to have had the growth of a century  It is remarkable that we find scarce any disposition of ground that belongs to a moun∣tainous country of which Virgil has not taken notice The scenes we now examined he exactly describes only he has given his hills the ornament of wood which he knew was their most picturesque dress  Tendit  Gramineum in campum quem collibus undique curvis  Cingebant sylvae mediaque in valle theatri  Circus erat  Not far from these circular plains appears  Gobrayhall  once the capital of these do∣mains but now a neglected mansion If situation can recommend a place this seems to enjoy one in great perfection It stands on high ground with higher still behind it We did not ride up to the house but it seemed to command a noble view of the lake and of the scenery around it  Nearly at the point where Ulleswater makes it's last curve stands the village of  WaterMullock  situated rather within the land Through this place the road carried us to the last reach of the lake which is the least beautiful part Here the hills grow smooth and lumpish and the country at every step loses some of the wild strokes of nature and degenerates if I may so speak into cultiva∣tion  At the end of the lake stands  Dunmallet  a remarkable hill which overlooks the last reach but is itself rather a disgusting object Shaped with conic exactness planted uni∣formly with Scotch firs and cut as uniformly into walks verging to a center it becomes a vile termination of a noble sceneOnce probably it was more interesting when the Roman eagle was planted as it formerly was upon it's summitwhen it's bold rough sides were in unison with the objects aroundand a noble castle frowned from it's precipices over the lake This fortress whose ram∣parts may yet easily be traced must once have been of considerable importance as it commanded all the avenues of the country  We had now finished our view of Ulles∣water which contains a wonderful variety of grand and picturesque scenes compressed within a very narrow compassIn one part not far from WaterMullock the road carried us to the higher grounds from whence we had a view of the whole lake and all it's vast accompaniments togethera troubled sea of mountains a broken sceneamusing but not picturesque  In our evening's ride we had skirted only one side of the lake and wished our time would have allowed us to skirt the other also It is probable the southern coast might have afforded very noble distant views of the woods and rocks of Gobraypark and the adjacent lofty grounds  We could have wished also to have navi∣gated the lake for though views from the  water  are in general less beautiful than the same views from the  land  as they want the  advantage of a foreground and also bring the horizon too low  See Page  yet it is probable the grand reaches of this lake and the woody promontories round which the water winds would have displayed many beautiful passages from a boat  One view from the water we heard much commended that of the last reach of the lake towards the conic hill of Dunmallet The sides of the lakeit's gliding away into the river Eamot which carries it offPoolybridge which is thrown over that river at the bottom of the lakeand the country beyondwere all much extolled but we could not conceive that any views at this end of the lake could be comparable to what we had seen near the shores of Patterdale especially any views in which the regular form of Dunmallet made so considerable a part  It would have added also to our amusement to have taken a view of the lake by moon∣light  For tho it is very difficult  in painting  to manage so feeble an effusion of light in such a manner as at the same time to  illumine objects  and  produce an effect  yet the  reality  in such scenes as these is attended often with a wonderful solemnity and grandeur That shadowy form of great objects which is sometimes traced out by a silver thread and sometimes by a kind of bright obscurity on a darker ground almost oppresses the imagination with sublime ideas Great effects also we sometimes see of light and shade tho only faintly marked In the absence of colour the clairobscur is more striking  one expanded sheet of light  Diffusing while the shades from rock to rock  Irregularly thrown with solemn gloom  Diversify the whole  I cannot leave the scenes of Ulleswater without taking notice of an uncommon fish which frequents it's waters and which is equally the object of the naturalist and of the epicure It is of the troutspecies beau∣tifully clad in scales of silver firm and finely  flavoured and of such dimensions that it has sometimes been known to weigh between thirty and forty pounds  Having now past the limits of the lake we traversed a very pleasant country in our road to Penrith keeping the Eamot com∣monly within view on our right and leaving on the left the ruins of Dacrecastle the ancient seat of the noble family of that name  No part of Cumberland is more inhabited by the genteeler families of the county than this Within the circumference of a few miles stand many of their houses some of which have formerly been castles but the road carried us in view only of two or three of them  Before we arrived at Penrith one of these fortresses which is known by the name of Penrithcastle presented us with a very noble ruin and under the most interesting circum∣stances The sun which through the length  of a summerday had befriended us with all his morning noon and evening powers preparing now with  farewell sweet  to take his leave gave us yet one more beautiful exhibition  A grand broken arch presented itself first in deep shadow Through the aperture ap∣peared a part of the internal structure thrown into perspective to great advantage and illu∣mined by the departing ray Other fragments of the shattered towers and battlements were just touched with the splendid tint but the body of light rested on those parts which were seen through the shadowed arch  In the offskip beyond the castle arose a hill in shadow likewise on the top of which stood a lonely beacon The windows answer∣ing each other we could just discern the glowing horizon through thema circum∣stance which however trivial in description has a beautiful effect in landscape  This beacon is a monument of those tumul∣tuous times which preceded the union and the only monument of the kind now remain∣ing in these parts though such beacons were formerly stationed over the whole country  and could spread intelligence in a few seconds from one end of it to the other  At this later day these castles and posts of alarm adorning the country they once defended raise pleasing reflections on a com∣parison of present times with pastthose tur∣bulent times when no man could sleep in safety unless secured by a fortress In war he feared the invasion of an open enemy and in peace a mischief still more formidable the ravages of banditti with whom the country was always at that time infested These wretches were composed of the outlaws from both nations and inhabiting the fastnesses of the bogs and mountains used to sally out and plunder in all directions  Penrith is a neat town situated not un∣pleasantly under mountains and in the neigh∣bourhood of lakes  In the churchyard we saw an ancient mo∣nument which has occasioned much specu∣lation among antiquarians It consists of two rough pillars with four semicircular stones fixed in the ground between them Dr Todd an antiquarian of the last age found out four  wildboars and other ingenious devices on the different parts of this monument We examined it with attention but could not find even the most distant resemblance of any form in nature The whole surface seemed to be nothing more than a piece of rough chissel workIn the church which is a handsome plain structure is placed a stone recording the ravages of the plague among the several towns of this neighbourhood in the year  As we leave Penrith which is within twenty miles of Carlisle we enter that vast waste called  Inglewoodforest  through which we rode at least nine miles in all which space there is scarce a tree to be seen and yet were it well planted as it once probably was many parts of it might be admired for the ground makes bold and noble swells the back scenery is composed of a grand sweep of mountains and on the left are dis∣tant views into a cultivated country  The mountains which adorn these scenes are the same we saw as we left Keswick only the more northern part of that circular  chain is now turned towards us In this view the ridge of Saddleback assumes that shape from which it derives it's appellation  That part of Inglewoodforest which lies nearest the town is known by the name of Penrithfell consisting of rough and hilly grounds One of the highest hills is occu∣pied by the beacon of which we had a dis∣tant view as we examined the ruins of Pen∣rithcastle  On this spot in the year the Cum∣berland militia assembled to oppose the re∣bels in their march to the south But a mi∣litia without discipline is never formidable The whole body fled as the van of the re∣bels appeared marching round an opposite hill  Nicolson bishop of Carlisle a strenuous man who had been very instrumental in bringing them together and now attended their march was so chagrined and mortified at their behaviour that in a fit of obstinate vexation he would not quit the field The  enemy was coming on apace His servants rode up to the coach for orders The bishop sat mute with indignation All thoughts of himself were lost in the public disgrace His coachman however whose feelings were less delicate thinking the management of affairs in this interruption of government now de∣volved upon him lashed his horses and car∣ried his master off the field  On the verge of the forest at a place called Plumpton a large Roman station or stative camp runs a quarter of a mile on the right You trace the ground broken variously where tents kitchens and earthen tables probably stood not unlike the vestiges of a modern encampment On the left appear the lines of a fort of considerable dimensions about one hundred and fifty yards square which was once the citadel of this military colony The ramparts and ditches may easily be traced on every side  The great road indeed which we travelled is intirely Roman and is laid almost by a line over the forest You seldom see a  winding  road of Roman construction Their survey∣ors  and pioneers had no idea of the line of beauty nor stood in reverence of any inclo∣sures but always took the shortest cut making the Appian way the model of all their provincial roads  At Ragmire about a mile farther where the road crosses a bog large wooden frame∣works yet uninjured by time were lately dug up which the Romans had laid as a foundation for their causey over that un∣stable surface  On leaving Inglewoodforest the road en∣ters an enclosed country in which is little variety and scarce an interesting object till we arrive at Carlisle  The approach to that city from the rising ground near the little village of Hereby is grand The town which terminates a vista of a mile in length takes a very compact form in which no part is seen but what makes a handsome appearance The square and massy tower of the castle rises on the right in the middle the cathedral rises still  higher and contiguous to it on the left appear the round towers of the citadel which was built by Henry VIII in the form of all his castles on the Hampshire and Kentish coasts  The beauty however of this approach is soon lost As we descend the hill from Hereby the town sinks into the insignificance of it's invirons  The entrance is still beautiful the road winding to the gate round the towers of the citadel  SECT XX  FEW towns offer a fairer field to an anti∣quary than Carlisle It's origin and history are remote curious and obscure It was unquestionably a place of consequence in Roman times Severus's wall just includes it in the British pale The vestiges of that barrier run within half a mile of it's gates and it probably figured first under the charac∣ter of a fortress on that celebrated rampart  In after ages it had it's share successively in the history of Saxons Danes and Scots and during the revolutions of these several nations was the scene of every vicissitude of war It hath been frequently besieged pil∣laged burnt and rebuilt Once it lay buried in it's ruins for the space of two centuries Rufus brought it again into existence The present town is founded on the vestiges of  former towns which in many parts have raised the ground within nearly to the height of the walls The foundations of a house are rarely dug without disturbing the ruins of some other house It has been the residence and it has been the prison of kings An old ash∣tree is still shewn near the gate of the castle which is said to have been planted by the unfortunate Mary of Scotland who spent a part of her captivity in this fortress whither she was soon brought after her landing at Workington Many princes also have shed their royal favours on this ancient town and made it's fortifications their care  Now all it's military honours are disgraced Northern commotions are no longer dreaded It's gates stand always open and it's walls the object of no farther attention are falling fast into ruin The firing of a morning and an evening gun from the castle which was the last garrisonform that remained hath been discontinued these six years to the great regret of the country around whose hours of labour it regulated  But I mean not to enter into the history of Carlisle it concerns me only as an object of beauty Within it's walls indeed it contains little that deserves notice The castle is heavy in all it's parts as these fabrics commonly are It is too perfect to afford much pleasure to the picturesque eye except as a remote object softened by distance Hereafter when it's shattered towers and buttresses give a light∣ness to it's parts it may adorn some future landscape  The cathedral deserves still less attention It is a heavy Saxon pile and there is nothing about it that is beautiful except the eastwindow which is a rich and very elegant piece of Gothic ramification  The  fratry  as it is called or chapterhouse in the abbey is the only building that de∣serves notice On one side where it has formerly been connected with the cloysters it has little beauty but on the other next the deanery it's proportions and ornaments are elegant It seems to be of that style of archi∣tecture which prevailed rather before the two later Henries  But though Carlisle furnishes little amuse∣ment within it's walls yet it adds great beauty as a distant object to the country around Few towns enjoy a better situation It stands on a rising ground in the midst of meadows watered by two considerable rivers which flowing on different sides of the city unite a little below it and form the whole groundplot on which it stands into a kind of peninsula Beyond the meadows the ground rises in almost all parts at different distances  The meadows around it especially along the banks of the river Eden want only a little more wood to make them very beautiful In high floods which happen two or three times in the course of a winter they exhibit a very grand scene The town appears stand∣ing out like a promontory in the midst of a vast lake  The short siege which Carlisle sustained in the rebellion of the year together with some awkward circumstances that attended it threw  a general odium upon the town and many be∣lieved among whom was the late duke of Cum∣berland that it was very illaffected to the go∣vernment No suspicion was ever more unjust I dare take upon me to say there were scarce half a dozen people in the whole place who wished well to the rebellion  The following anecdote known but to few and totally unknown till many years after the event will throw some light on it's hasty surrender which brought it into such dis∣grace  When the rebels came before it it was garrisoned only by two companies of invalids and two raw undisciplined regiments of mi∣litia General Wade lay at Newcastle with a considerable force and the governor of Carlisle informing him how unprovided he was begged a reinforcement The single hope of this relief enabled the gentlemen of the country who commanded the militia to keep their men under arms  In the mean time the rebels were known to be as illprepared for an attack as the town was for a defence They had now lain a week before it and found it was impracticable for  want of artillery to make any attempt They feared also an interruption from general Wade and besides were unwilling to delay any longer their march towards London Under these difficulties they had come to a resolution to abandon their design  At this critical time the governor of Carlisle received a letter from general Wade informing him he was so circumstanced that he could not possibly send the reinforcement that had been desired This mortifying intelligence tho not publickly known was however communicated to the principal officers and to some others among whom was a busy at∣torney whose name was Hs  Hs was then addressing a young lady the daughter of Mr Fr a gentleman of the country and to assist his cause and give himself consequence with his intended father in law he whispered to him among his other political secrets the disappointment from ge∣neral Wade  The whisper did not rest here Fr frequented a club in the neighbourhood where observing in the jollity of a chearful evening that only friends were present he gave his company the information he had just received from Hs  There was in that company one Sd a gentleman of some fortune near Carlisle who tho a known papist was however at that time thought to be of very intire affection to the government This man possessed of such a secret and wishing for an opportunity to serve a cause which he favoured in his heart took horse that very night after he left the clubroom and rode directly to the rebelcamp which he found under orders to break up the next morning He was carried imme∣diately to the Duke of Perth and others of the rebel leaders to whom he communicated his intelligence and assured them they might expect a mutiny in the town if they conti∣nued before it one day longer Counter orders were immediately issued and the next day the Cumberland and Westmoreland militia being under no discipline began to mutiny and dis∣perse and the town defended now only by two companies of invalids was thought no longer tenable The governor was tried by a courtmartial and acquitted and nobody supposed that either the militiaofficers or their men were impressed by any motive worse than fear  In so variegated a country as England there are few parts which do not afford many pleasing and picturesque scenes The most probable way of finding them as I observed a little above is to follow the course of the rivers About their banks we shall generally find the richest scenery which the country can produce This rule we followed in the few excursions which we had time to make from Carlisle and first we took a view of the river Cauda  Near the town this river is broken into so many streams and throws up every where so many barren beds of pebbles that there is no great beauty in this part of it's course But above where higher banks confine it's impetu∣osity it becomes more interesting The vales of Sebergham and Dalston we heard much commended The former we did not visit▪ the latter we followed with great pleasure along it's winding course for many miles and found ourselves often in the midst of very beau∣tiful scenes the river being shut up sometimes  by close and lofty banks and sometimes flow∣ing through meadows edged with wood  Among other situations on the Cauda we were much pleased with that of Rosecastle the seat of the bishop of Carlisle which stands on a gentle rise in a wide part of the vale the river winding round it in a semicircular form at about half a mile's distance The ground between the castle and the river con∣sists of beautiful meadows and beyond the river the lofty bank which winds with it is wellplanted and forms a sweep of hanging wood The castle composed of square towers tho no object on the spot is a good orna∣ment to the scene  Between Rosecastle and Wigton the coun∣try abounds with the relicks of Roman in∣campments At a place called Chalkcliff which by the way is a cliff of red stone this legionary inscription is engraved in the native rock  LEG  II  AVG  MILITES FEC  COH  III  COH  IIII  From the Cauda our next excursion was along the Eden On the banks of this river we were informed of many interesting scenes At Kirkoswal and Nunnery particularly the country was represented as very engaging but Corbycastle about five miles from Carlisle was the only place above the town which we had time to visit  At Wetherall we ferried over the river and landed under the castle which stands on the edge of a lofty bank This bank stretches at least three miles along the course of the river partly below but chiefly above the castle I give it it's ancient title tho it is now a mere modern house without the least vestige of it's primeval dignity Below the castle the bank is rocky and falls precipitately into the water above it makes a more gentle descent and leaves an edging which in some parts spreads into little winding meads and where it is nar∣rowest is broad enough for a handsome walk The whole bank both above and below the castle is covered with wood large oak and ash and in many places the scenery is rocky also But the rocks are not of the grey kind  stained with a variety of different tintsthe  saxa circumlita musco  but incline rather to a sandy red which is not the most coalescing hue They give however great spirit and beauty to the scene  The bank of the river  opposite  to the castle is likewise high in many parts woody in others affording an intermixture of wood and lawn Here stand the ruins of Wetherallabbey tho little more of it is left than a square tower which is some ornament tho no very picturesque one to the scene These ruins were once extensive and I have heard beau∣tiful but the dean and chapter of Carlisle to whom the place belongs some years ago car∣ried off the stones with more oeconomy than taste to build a prebendal house  On this side of the river also an object presents itself known by the name of  Wetherallsafeguard  which is esteemed a great curiosity It consists of three chambers cut in the solid rock which being in this part almost a pre∣cipice the access to these chambers is very difficult It is supposed to have been an ap∣pendage of the abbey where the monks in times of disorder secreted their wealth Some antiquarians suppose it to have been  inhabited by a religious devotee and call it  St Constantine's cell  It is rather a curious place than any great ornament to the scene  To the natural advantages of the scenery about Corbycastle the improvements of art have added little The late proprietor who had seen nothing himself and imagined from the resort of strangers to see the beauty of his situation that they admired his taste resolved to make Corby one of the most sumptuous places in Europe With this view he scooped his rocks into grottosfabricated a cascade consisting of a lofty flight of regular stone steps cut a straight walk through his woods along the banks of the river at the end of which he reared a temple and being resolved to add every ornament that expence could procure he hired an artist of the country at fourpence a day for labour was then cheap to make statues Numberless were the works of this genius Diana Neptune Polyphemus Nymphs and Satyrs in abundance and a variety of other figures became soon the ornaments of the woods and met the eye of the spectator wherever he turned A punster who was re∣markable for making only one good pun in his life made it here Pointing to one of these  strange figures he called it  a satyr upon the place  But the taste of the present age hath destroyed the pride of the last The present proprietor hath done little but what he hath done is done well The rocks indeed scooped into holes can never be restored to their native simplicity and grandeur Their bold projec∣tions are for ever effaced Nor could a century restore those trees which were rooted up to form the vista But the statues like the ancient sculpture of the Egyptians are now no more The temple is going fast into ruins and the cascade so frivolous if it had even been good in it's kind on the banks of a great and rapid river is now overgrown with thic∣kets The old line of the walk could not easily be effaced but a new one beyond the temple is carried on which follows naturally the course of the river And indeed this part of the walk admits more beauty than any other for the varieties of ground are greater the bank and edging of meadow are more irregular and the river more sinuous  The path having conducted us along the river through these pleasing irregulariti  about two miles from the castle climbs  higher grounds and returns through  and beautiful sheep walks which lie on  sides and summit of the bank  Through the whole of this walk both at the top and bottom are many pleasant views but they are all of the more confined kind  Many parts of this walk were wrought by the manual labour of the priest of the family which is a popish branch of the Howards He belongs to an order which injoins it's members to work in the ground so many hours a day laying them with admirable wisdom under the wholesome necessity of acquiring health and spirits I am persuaded that if a studious man were  obliged  to dig three or four hours a day he would study the better during the remaining part of it We had been re∣commended to the civilities of this ecclesiastic the family being then in France and found him at work in the garden He received us politely and discovered the manners of a gen∣tleman under the garb of a daylabourer without the least apology for his dress and occupation There is something very pleasing  in the simplicity and manliness of not being ashamed of the necessary functions of any state which we have made our option in lifeThis ecclesiastic succeeded Father Walsh who has lately engaged the attention of the public I have dwelt the longer on this scene as it is the most admired one in Cumberland  From Corbycastle to Warwick which lies about two miles nearer Carlisle on the banks of the same river the road is beautiful Many admire the situation of Warwick also It seems to be a sweet retired scene but we had not time to view it  The antiquarian's eye is immediately caught here by the parishchurch the chancel of which forming the segment of a circle and being pierced with small lancetwindows shews at once that it is of Norman origin Tho every other mark were obliterated he will tell you that this is evidence sufficient of it's an∣tiquity  SECT XXI  HAVING seen as much of the river Eden above Carlisle as our time would al∣low we made our next excursion towards it's mouth where Brughmarsh attracted our at∣tention In our way we had many pleasing river views  Brughmarsh lies at the extremity of the English border running up as far as Solway∣frith which in this part divides England from Scotland It is a vast extended plain flat as the surface of a quiet ocean I do not remember that land ever gave me before so vast an idea of space The idea of this kind which such scenes as SalisburyPlain suggests is much less pure The inequality of the ground there sets bounds to the idea It is  the ocean in a storm in which the idea of extension is greatly broken and intercepted by the turbulence of the waves Brughmarsh indeed gives us the idea of solid water rather than of land if we except only the colour  Interminable meads  And vast savannahs where the wandering eye  Unfixt is in a verdant ocean lost  Brughmarsh is one of those extended plains only more extensive than such plains com∣monly are from which the sea in a course of ages hath retired It is difficult to com∣pute it's limits It ranges many leagues in every direction from a centre for space so diffuse assumes of course a circular appearance without a hedge or even a bush to inter∣cept it's bounds till it softens into the azure mountains of the horizon Nothing indeed but mountains can circumscribe such a scene All inferior boundaries of woods and rising grounds are lost On the English side it is bounded by that circular chain in the heart of Cumberland in which Skiddaw is pre∣eminent Nothing intermediate appears On the Scotch side it's course is interrupted through the space of a few leagues by Solway∣frith  which spreads when the tide is at ebb into a vast stretch of sand The plain however is still preserved and having passed this sandy obstruction it changes it's hue again into vivid green and stretches far and wide into the Scotch border till it's progress at length is stopped by the mountains of Galloway and Niddsdale This extension is as much as the eye can well comprehend Had the plain been boundless like an Arabian desert I know not whether it would not have lost that idea of space which so vast a cir∣cumscription gives it  The whole area of Brughmarsh which from it's  denomination  we should suppose to be swampy is every where perfectly firm and the turf soft bright and pure Scarce a weed rears it's head Nothing appears of statelier growth than a mushroom which spreads here in very luxuriant knots  This vast plain is far from being a desert waste Innumerable herds of cattle pasture at large in it's rich verdure and range as in a state of nature  But tho the primary idea which this scene presents arises purely from space and is therefore an idea rather grand than pictu∣resque yet is it not totally incapable of pic∣turesque embellishment It is true it wants almost every ingredient of landscape on the foreground it wants objects to preserve the keeping and in the offskip that profusion of little parts which in a scene of cultivation gives richness to distance In treating there∣fore a subject of this kind on canvas recourse must be had to adventitious objects Cattle come most naturally to hand which being stationed in various groups at different dis∣tances may serve both as a foreground to the landscape and as a gage to the perspective  Brughmarsh is farther remarkable for having been the scene of one of the greatest catas∣trophes of the English historythe death of Edward the I Here after the third revolt of Scotland that prince drew together the most puissant army which England had ever seen The Scots from their borders saw the whole plain whitened with tents but they  knew not how nearly their deliverance ap∣proached The greatest events generally arrive unlooked for They saw a delay and after∣wards a confusion in the mighty host before them but they heard not till three days after that the soul and spirit of the enter∣prize was gone and that their great adver∣sary lay breathless in his camp  Edward had been taken ill at Carlisle where he had met his parliament But nei∣ther disease nor age for he was now near seventy could repress his ardour Tho he could not mount his horse he ordered him∣self to be carried in a litter to the camp where the troops received him with accla∣mations of joy But it was shortlived The motion had irritated his disorder into a vio∣lent dysentery which immediately carried him off  The English borderers long revered the memory of a prince who had so often chastised an enemy they hated and in gratitude reared a pillar to his name which still testifies the spot on which he died It stands rather on  the edge of the marsh and bears this simple inscription  MEMORIAE AETERNAE EDVARDI REGIS ANGLIAE LONGÈ CLARISSIMI QUI IN BELLI APPARATU CONTRA SCOTOS OCCUPATUS HIC IN CASTRIS OBIIT JULII A D  Among other places in the neighbourhood of Carlisle we made an excursion into Gills∣land with an intention chiefly to see Na∣worthcastle the vale and ruins of the Abbey of Lanercost and the ruins of Scalebycastle  As we leave Carlisle along the great mili∣tary road to Newcastle the view of the river Eden from Stanwixbank is very pleasing The curve it describes the beautiful mea∣dows it winds through and the mountains which close the scene make all together a very amusing combination of objects Wood only is wanting  On crossing the river Irthing about seven miles from Carlisle the country which was before unpleasing becomes rich and interest∣ing Here we enter the barony of Gillsland an extensive district which consists in this part of a great variety of hill and dale The hills are sandy bleak and unpleasant but the vallies which are commonly of the contracted kind are beautiful They are ge∣nerally woody and each of them watered by some little busy streamFrom these vallies or  gills  as the countrypeople call them with which the whole barony abounds Camp∣den supposes it to have taken the name of Gillsland  On a delightful knoll gently gliding into a sinuous  gill  surrounded with fullgrown oak and overlooking the vale of Lanercost stands Naworthcastle The house which consists of two large square towers united by a main body is too regular to be beauti∣ful unless thrown into perspective It was formerly one of those fortified places in which  the nobility and gentry of the borders were obliged to live in those times of confusion which preceded the union And indeed the whole internal contrivance of this castle ap∣pears calculated either to keep an enemy out or to elude his search if he should happen to get in The idea of a comfortable dwell∣ing has been totally excluded The staterooms are few and ordinary but the little apartments and hiding holes accessible only by dark passages and blind staircases are innumerable Many of the close recesses which it contains are probably at this time unknown Nothing indeed can mark in stronger colours the fears and jealousies and caution of those times than the internal struc∣ture of one of these castles  Naworthcastle was formerly the capital mansion of the barons of Gillsland who at so great a distance from court and seated in a country at that time untamed by law are said to have exercised very extraordinary powers The Lord William Howard who is remembered by the name of  bald Willy  is still the object of invective for his acts of tyranny His prisons are shewn and the site of his gibbets where in the phrase of  the country he would  head and hang  out judge or jury  But it is probable that his memory is injured He acted under a standing commission of oyer and terminer from Elizabeth and was one of those bold spirits which are necessary to repress the vio∣lence of lawless times Many acts of power undoubtedly he committed but his difficult situation compelled him This part of the kingdom was most harrassed by those troops of mischievous banditti whom I have just had occasion to mention They were a nu∣merous and not an illregulated body act∣ing under leaders whom a spirit of enter∣prize raised to power These miscreants in times even of profoundest peace called for all the wariness and activity of the chiefs of the country Sometimes they would plunder in large bodies and sometimes in little pilfering bands When they were taken in the fact or as it was called by the  bloody hand  they were put to instant death In other cases a jury was impannelled  The active chief who gave occasion to this digression seems to have lived in as much terror himself as he spread among others He had contrived a sort of citadel in his own  castle a room which is still shewn with an iron door where he constantly slept and where his armour lies rusting to this day From him the earls of Carlisle are descended and have been in succession the proprietors of Naworthcastle  As we left this old fortress and descended the hill towards the ruins of the abbey of Lanercost which lie about two miles farther the whole vale in which they are seated opened before us It is esteemed one of the sweetest scenes in this country and indeed we found it such It's area is about half a mile in breadth and two or three miles in length consisting of one ample sweep The sides which are gentle declivities are covered thick with wood in which larger depreda∣tions have been lately made than are con∣sistent with picturesque beautyAt the distant end of the vale where the woods appear to unite the river Irthing enters which is con∣siderable enough tho divided into two channels to be fully adequate to the scene The banks of the river and indeed the whole area of the vale are sprinkled with clumps  and single trees which have a good effect in breaking the lines and regular continuity of the sidescreens and in hiding here and there the course of the river and especially the bridges which would otherwise be too bare and formal  Near that extremity of the vale which is opposite to Naworthcastle lies the abbey At a distance it forms a good object rising among the woods As you approach it be∣gins to raise a disappointment and on the spot it is but an unpleasing ruin The whole is a heavy Saxon pile compressed together without any of that airy lightness which accompanies the Gothic Scarce one  detached  fragment appears in any point of view The tower is low and without either form or ornament and one of the great ailes is mo∣dernized into an awkward parishchurch The only beautiful part of the whole is the east end It is composed of four broken ailes every wall of which consists of two tiers of arches affording a very unusual appearance and at the same time a very amusing confu∣sion from the uncommon multiplication of so many arches and pillarsThis part of the abbey seems to have been a separate  chapel or perhaps an oratory belonging to the noble family of Dacre which had once possessions in these parts Here lie the re∣mains of several ancient chiefs of that house whose sepulchral honours are now almost in∣tirely obliterated Their blazoned arms and Gothic tombs many of which are sumptuous are so matted with briars and thistles that even the foot of curiosity is kept at a distance  Except these remains of the abbeychurch no other parts of this ancient monastery are now left except an old gateway and a square building patched into a farmhouse which has no beauty  In returning to Carlisle we passed through the valley of Cambeck which contains some pleasing scenery and a very considerable Roman station on a high bank at  Castlesteeds  Rivers often present us with very moral analogies their characters greatly resembling those of men The violent the restless the  the active the sluggish the gentle  and many other epithets be∣  to both The little stream  which divides the valley of Cambeck sug∣gested the analogy It's whole course is marked with acts of violence In every part you see heaps of barren sand and gravel which in it's furious moods it has thrown up some∣times on one side and sometimes on another destroying every where the little scenes of beauty and plots of cultivation  About three miles further stand the ruins of Scalebycastle This was another of those fortified houses which are so frequent in this country  It stands as castles rarely do on a flat and yet tho it's site be illadapted to any modes of defence it has been a place of more than ordinary strength Rocks knolls and bold projecting promontories on which castles usually stand suggest various advan∣tages of situation and generally determine the kind of structure On a flat the engi∣neer was at liberty to choose his own Every part was alike open to assault  He first drew two circular motes round the spot he designed to fortify the circumfe∣rence of the outward circle was about a mile  The earth thrown out of these two motes which were broad and deep seems to have been heaped up at the centre where there is a considerable rise On this was built the castle which was entered by two drawbridges and defended by a high tower and a very lofty wall  At present one of the motes only remains The other is filled up but may still be traced The castle is more perfect than such build∣ings commonly are The walls are very in∣tire and great part of the tower which is square is still left It preserved it's perfect form till the civil wars of the last century when the castle in too much confidence of it's strength shut it's gates against Cromwell then marching into Scotland who made it a monument of his vengeance  What share of picturesque genius Crom∣well might have I know not Certain how∣ever it is that no man since Henry the eighth has contributed more to adorn this country with picturesque ruins The differ∣ence between these two masters lay chiefly in the style of ruins in which they composed Henry adorned his landscapes with the ruins of abbeys Cromwell with those of castles  I have seen many pieces by this master executed in a very grand style but seldom a finer monument of his masterly hand than this He has rent the tower and demolished two of it's sides the edges of the other two he has shattered into broken lines The chasm discovers the whole plan of the internal struc∣turethe vestiges of the several storiesthe insertion of the arches which supported them the windows for speculation and the breastwork for assault  The walls of this castle are uncommonly magnificent They are not only of great height but of great thickness and defended by a large bastion which appears to be of more modern workmanship The greatest part of them is chambered within and wrought into secret recesses A massy port∣cullis gate leads to the ruins of what was once the habitable part of the castle in which a large vaulted hall is the most re∣markable apartment and under it are dark and capacious dungeons  The area within the mote which consists of several acres was originally intended to support the cattle which should be driven thither in times of alarm When the house  was inhabited whose chearful and better days are still remembered this area was the garden and all around on the outside of the mote stood noble trees irregularly planted the growth of a century Beneath the trees ran a walk round the castle to which the situation naturally gave that pleasing curve which in modern days hath been so much the object of art This walk might admit of great embellishment On one hand it com∣mands the ruins of the castle in every point of view on the other a country which tho flat is not unpleasing consisting of extensive meadows which a little planting would turn into beautiful lawns bounded by lofty mountains  This venerable pile has now undergone a second ruin The old oaks and elms the ancient natives of the scene are felled Weeds and spiry grass have taken possession of the courts and obliterated the very plan of a garden while the house itself whose hos∣pitable roof deserved a better fate is now a scene of desolation Two wretched families the only inhabitants of the place occupy the two ends of the vaulted hall the fragment of a tattered curtain reaching half was to  the top being the simple boundary of their respective limits All the rest is waste no other part of the house is habitable The chambers unwindowed and almost unroofed fluttering with rags of ancient tapestry are the haunt of daws and pigeons which burst out in clouds of dust when the doors are opened while the floors yielding to the tread make curiosity dangerous A few pictures heirlooms of the wall which have long deserved oblivion by I know not what fate are the only appendages of this dissolving pile which have triumphed over the injuries of time  Shakespear's castle of Macbeth could not be more the haunt of swallows and martins than this You see them every where about the ruins either twittering on broken coins threading some fractured arch or pursuing each other in screaming circles round the walls of the castle  In this old castle the author of this tour was born and spent his early youth which must be his apology for dwelling so long upon itSince this description was written it has in some degree been repaired    SECT XXII  OUR last expedition in the neighbourhood of Carlisle was to see the improvements of Mr Graham of Netherby and the scene of desolation occasioned by the late overflowing of Solwaymoss  Mr Graham's improvements are not con∣fined to a garden or the space of a mile or two around his house The whole country is changed and from a barren waste hath assumed the faceif not of beauty at least of fertility  The domain of Netherby lies on the very skirts of the English border The Romans considered it as a part of Caledonia and shut it from the British pale In after ages the district around it assumed the name of the  Debateableland  and was the great rendez∣vous of those crews of outlawed banditti who under the denomination of  Mosstroopers  plun∣dered the country We have already had occasion to mention them In this neighbour∣hood were the strong holds of many of their chiefs particularly of Johnny Armstrong of famous memory the moted ruins of whose castle are still extant  Among these people the arts of tillage were unknown It was absurd to be at the trouble of sowing land themselves when they could so easily plunder the lands of others  Tho the union of the two kingdoms put an end to these ravages on the borders yet the manners of the inhabitants in some respects suffered little change Their native laziness and inattention to all the arts of husbandry remained They occupied large tracts of ex∣cellent land at easy rates but having no idea of producing yearly crops from the same soil by culture they ploughed their patches of ground alternately leaving them to recover their fer∣tility by fallows An indolent and scanty maintenance was all they wished and this they obtained from a small portion of their land with a small portion of their labour Their  lords in the mean time never lived on the spot and knew little of the state either of the country or of it's inhabitants  Mr Graham immediately set himself to alter this state of things He built a noble mansion for himself which makes a grand appearance rising on the ruins of a Roman station With∣out the presence of the lord he knew it was in vain to expect reformation He divided his lands into moderate farms and built com∣modious farmhouses As his lands improved he raised his rents and his tenants in proportion found it necessary to increase their labour Thus he has doubled his own income and intro∣duced a spirit of industry into the country These indolent inhabitants of the borders begin now to work like other labourers and notwithstanding they pay higher rents live more comfortably for idleness can never be attended with the comforts of industry  To bring about this great change Mr Graham thinks it necessary to rule his subjects with a rod of iron While he makes them labourers he keeps them slavesPerhaps indeed the rough manners of the people in  those parts could not easily be moulded by the hand of tenderness  The feudal idea of vassalage which has long disappeared in all the internal parts of England remains here in great force and throws a large share of power into the hands of the land∣holder Mr Graham's estates which are very extensive contain about six hundred tenants all of whom with their families lie in a manner at his mercy for their subsistence Their time and labour he commands by their mode of tenure whenever he pleases Under the denomination of  boondays  he expects at any time their personal service and can in a few hours muster the strength of five or six hundred men and horses  Once he had occasion to call them together on military service On a supposed injury  I have heard since that this injury has been proved to be a real one and that reparation hath been made  which about two years ago he had done the  Scotchborderers by intercepting the salmon in the Esk a body of three hundred of these people marched down upon him with an in∣tention to destroy his works He had intelli∣gence of their design and issuing his precepts mustered in a few hours above four hundred men before his gates armed as the exigence would allow and if the Scotch on finding such superiority had not retreated Mr Gra∣ham who told us the story himself said he believed that all the spirit and animosity of ancient times would have revived on this occasion  In a civil light he acts on as large a scale His manorcourts are kept with great strict∣ness in which his attorney with a jury sits regularly to try causes and the tenants are injoined at the hazard of being turned out of their farms to bring into these courts every suit under the value of five pounds Thus he prevents much illblood among them by bring∣ing their disputes to a speedy issue and giving the quarrel no time to rankle He saves them also much expence for a suit which in the  king's courts would at least cost five or six pounds may in his be carried through all it's forms for eightpenceAt Patterdale we found a nominal king Here we found almost a king in reality  The works on the Esk which gave so much offence to the Scotchborderers deserve more notice They consisted of a massy head thrown across the river constructed at a great ex∣pence of hewn stone This mole was formed at right angles with the bank but the floods of the ensuing winter swept it away It was attempted a second time on the same plan but was a second time destroyed Mr Brindley was then sent for whose works near Manches∣ter had given him so high a reputation He changed the plan and instead of carrying the mole in a direct line across the river formed it in a curve arching against the stream so that it resists the current as a bridge does the incumbent weight This work has stood several very great floods and seems sufficiently  firm  Since this was written I am informed Mr Brindley's work was destroyed from an unsuspected quarter when the water was low On the breaking of a frost a great quantity of ice coming down the river and collecting at this stoppage some of it edged under the looser parts of the foundation and being pressed on with a continued accession of strength the whole blew up  From the curvature of it's form the fall of the water appears also to more advantage It now forms a semicircular cove which has a fine effect  The chief end which this work had in view was a fishery At this place salmoncoops are placed where all the fish which enter the Esk are taken But besides this and other purposes of utility it adds great beauty to the neighbourhood The Esk which was before in comparison a shallow stream gliding unseen beneath it's banks is now a noble piece of water raised to a level with them and seen to great advantage from the house and every part of the ground  It was in this part of the country where that dreadful inundation from the overflowing of  Solwaymoss destroyed lately so large a district To see the effects of this was the object of our next expedition  Solwaymoss is a flat area about seven miles in circumference The  substance  of it is a gross fluid composed of mud and the putrid fibres of heath diluted by internal springs which arise in every part The  sur∣face  is a dry crust covered with moss and rushes offering a fair appearance over an unsound bottomshaking under the least pres∣sure Cattle by instinct know and avoid it Where rushes grow the bottom is soundest The adventrous passenger therefore who some∣times in dry seasons traverses this perilous waste to save a few miles picks his cautious way over the rushy tussocks as they appear before him If his foot slip or if he venture to desert this mark of security it is possible he may never more be heard of  At the battle of Solway in the time of Henry VIII Oliver Sinclair was imprudently set over the Scotch army which had no con∣fidence in him A total rout ensued when an unfortunate troop of horse driven by their fears plunged into this morass which in∣stantly closed upon them The tale which  was traditional was generally believed but is now authenticated A man and horse in compleat armour were lately found by the peatdiggers in the place where it was always supposed the affair had happened and are preserved at the house of a Scotch baronet if I mistake not of the name of Maxwell as we were informed by a gentleman  Joseph Dacre  Esq  of Kirklinton near Longtown  of the borders who assured us he had seen them himself The skeleton of each was well pre∣served and the different parts of the armour easily distinguished  Solwaymoss is bounded on the south by a cultivated plain which declines gently through the space of a mile to the river Esk This plain is rather lower than the moss itself being separated from it by a breastwork formed by digging peat which makes an irregular tho perpendicular line of low black boundary  It was the bursting of the moss through this peat breastwork over the plain between it and the Esk which occasioned that dreadful ruin the effects of which we came hither to explore The more remarkable circumstances re∣lating  to this calamitous event as we had them on the best authority were these  On the th of November in a dark tempestuous night the inhabitants of the plain were alarmed with a dreadful crash which they could in no way account for Many of them were then abroad in the fields watching their cattle lest the Esk which was rising violently in the storm should carry them off None of those miserable people could conceive the noise they heard to proceed from any cause but the overflowing of the river in some shape tho to them unaccountable Such indeed as lived nearer the source of the eruption were sensible that the noise came in a different direction but were equally at a loss for the cause  In the mean time the enormous mass of fluid substance which had burst from the moss moved slowly on spreading itself more and more as it got possession of the plain Some of the inhabitants through the terror of the night could plainly discover it advanc∣ing like a moving hill This was in fact the case for the gush of mud carried before it  through the first two or three hundred yards of it's course a part of the breastwork which tho low was yet several feet in perpendicular height But it soon deposited this solid mass and became a heavy fluid One house after another it spread roundfilledand crushed into ruin just giving time to the terrified inhabitants to escape Scarce any thing was saved except their lives nothing of their furniture few of their cattle Some people were even surprized in their beds and had the additional distress of flying naked from the ruin  The morninglight explained the cause of this amazing scene of terror and shewed the calamity in it's full extent and yet among all the conjectures of that dreadful night the mischief which really happened had never been supposed Who could have imagined that a breastwork which had stood for ages should at length give way or that those sub∣terraneous floods which had been bedded in darkness since the memory of man should ever burst from their black abode  This dreadful inundation tho the first shock of it was the most tremendous continued still spreading for many weeks till it covered the whole plainan area of five hundred acres and like molten metal poured into a mould filled all the hollows of it lying in some parts thirty or forty feet deep reducing the whole to one level surface The overplus found it's way into the Esk where it's quantity was such as to annoy the fish no salmon during that season venturing into the river We were assured also that many lumps of earth which had floated out at sea were taken up some months after at the isle of Man  As we descended from the higher grounds to take a nearer view of this scene of horror it exhibited a very grand appearance The whole plain was covered by a thick smoke occasioned by a smothering fire set to it in various parts with a view to consume it and brought before us that simple and sublime idea of  the smoke of a country going up like the smoke of a furnace  When we came to the plain on that side which is next the Esk it had so forbidding an aspect as far as we could discover through the smoke that we almost despaired of crossing to the chasm as we had intended On horse∣back it was impossible and when we had alighted we stood hesitating on the brink whether it were prudent even on foot to attempt so dangerous a march  While we remained in this situation we observed several groups of peasants working in the ruins and beckoning to the nearest one of the group came forward He was an el∣derly man strengthening his steps with a long measuring wand His features and gait tho hard and clownish were marked with an air of vulgar consequence As he approached one of our company who knew him accosted him by the name of Wilson and we found he was the person who conducted the works which were set on foot to clear the soil of this melancholy incumbrance  On informing him of our difficulties and asking whether we might venture across the plain he bad us like Caesar with an air of assurance follow him and fear nothing From one tussock to another we followed  sometimes steppingsometimes leapingand sometimes hesitating whether to go on or to return In very difficult places our guide condescended to lay us a plank In the midst of our perplexity one of our company stray∣ing a step from the right path fell in but the mud being shallow in that part he sank only to the knees Mr Wilson helped him out but reprimanded his carelessness The reproof and the example having a good effect upon us all we followed our guide like packhorses in a string and at length compleated our undertaking  When we got to the gulph from whence all this mischief had issued the spectacle was hideous The surface of  the moss itself  had suffered little change Near the chasm it appeared indented through a space of several yards but not in any degree as one would have expected from so vast a discharge The mouth of the chasm was heaped round by monstrous piles of ruin formed by the broken breastwork and shell of the moss on the first great burst and a black mossy tincture continued still to issue from it If this con∣tinue to run as it probably will it may be a fortunate circumstance and save the country  from any farther mischief by draining this bloated mass through a perpetual discharge  As we stood on the higher ground and got to windward of the smoke we obtained a clear idea of the plain and of the course of the irruption over it Many fragments of a very large size which had been carried away in the first full stream of the discharge appeared thrown to a considerable distance These were what made that moving bulwark which some of the inhabitants had seen in the night Fragments of a smaller size and yet many of these considerable appeared scattered over the plain as the heavy torrent was able to carry them The interstices between the fragments which had been filled with fluid moss were now baked by the heat of the sun and crusted over like the great surface of the moss itself Here and there along this surface the broken rafters of a house or the top of a blasted tree were seen and made an odd appearance rising as it were out of the ground But through the whole waste there was not the least sign left of any culture tho this plain had once been the pride of the country Lands which  in the evening would have let for twenty shillings an acre by the morninglight were not worth sixpence  On this well cultivated plain twentyeight families had their dwellings and little farms every one of which except perhaps a few who lived near the skirts of it had the world totally to begin again Mr Graham agree∣ably to the prudential maxims he has ever observed affords them little assistance himself and discourages the bounty of others He seems to wish his dominions should thrive by industry alone and would have his subjects depend on this great virtue for the supply of every want and the reparation of every loss If the maxim in so full an extent be good it requires at least a great hardiness of resolu∣tion to carry it into practice  Whether the immense work of clearing this plain can ever totally be effected is a doubt with many It is attempted however with great spirit through the united force of the two powerful elements of fire and water  All the skirts and other parts of it which are drier than the rest are reduced by fire which occasioned the great smoke from the plain as we descended into it and which at that distance appeared to arise from the whole area  But this method is not found very effectual as it reaches only a little below the surface Much more is expected from the application of water which is the part our guide Mr Wilson has undertakenHow well qualified he is for the undertaking and in what manner he proposes to accomplish it may be conceived from the following story  Mr Graham's house stands on an eminence with higher grounds above it A little on one side of the front stood a knoll which made a disagreeable appearance before his windows Being desirous therefore of removing it he sent to Newcastle for a person accustomed to works of this kind The undertaker came surveyed the ground and estimated the expence at thir∣teen hundred pounds  While the affair was in agitation Mr Gra∣ham heard that Wilson had said the earth  might be removed at a much easier rate He was examined on the subject and his answers appeared so rational that he was set to work He had already surveyed the higher grounds where he first collected all the springs he found into two large reservoirs from which he cut a precipitate channel pointed at an abrupt corner of the knoll He cut also a channel of communication between his two reservoirs These being both filled he opened his sluices and let out such a continued torrent of water the upper pool feeding the lower that he very soon carried away the corner of the knoll against which he had pointed his artillery He then charged again and levelled against another part with equal success In short by a few efforts of this kind he carried away the whole hill and told Mr Graham with an air of triumph that if he pleased he would carry away his house next The work was compleated in a few days and Mr Gra∣ham himself informed us that the whole expence did not amount to twenty pounds  This man with so much genius about him lives in the lowest stile of life and works for the lowest wages When we regretted that he was paid so inadequately to his worth we  were assured as his appearance indeed testified that he had no higher idea of happiness than to get drunk after his day's labour and that better wages would only destroy him sooner  I have since heard that one hundred and fifty acres of the plain are now cleared by the ingenuity of this man and that there is reason to believe he will in time clear a considerable part of it From the reservoirs formed by a little stream at the highest part of the over∣flowed ground he cut channels in various directions to the Esk and when the water was let off he placed numbers of men by the side of the stream who rolled into it large masses of mossy earth which were hardened by the sun  SECT XXIII  HAVING seen such parts of the country on the borders of England as were most curious we set out on our return But instead of taking the Keswickroad we proposed to vary our rout by the mountains of Brugh  See page Vol I    At Penrith the road divides We turned to the left towards Appelby and soon fell into a rich and beautiful vale in which the river Lowther gliding under lofty woody banks bore us company a considerable way  When we crossed that river the situation of Broughamcastle one of the seats of the  celebrated countess of Pembroke attracted our notice It had not escaped the notice of the Romans who fixed here a station to com∣mand the country It appears as great at this time in a picturesque light as it did formerly in a military one But we had not time to ride up to it contenting ourselves with viewing it only as the ornament of a second distance  At Clifton the road opens again into a wild scene Here we examined the spot where in the year the rebels entering an in∣closed country made a stand and lined the hedges to retard the duke of Cumberland's pursuit Sir Joseph York in his road from Ireland had been there we found a few days before He had accompanied the duke in his expedition against the rebels and stopped a little at Clifton to review the scene He left the people we were informed much pleased with his remembering a gallant action which had been achieved about that time by a heroine of the country who had carried a letter across the fire of the rebels when no other messenger could be obtained  From Clifton we turned a little aside to see Lowtherhall the seat of lord Londsdale It is only a temporary house the old mansion having been burnt in the time of the late lord But materials are now collecting for a grand structure It is situated in an exten∣sive park which contains a great variety of beautiful scenery  From Lowtherhall we pursued our rout to Appelby keeping on our left that vast tract of barren country called Wingfieldforest  The situation of Appelbycastle which be∣longs to the earl of Thanet is magnificent It stands on a rocky eminence falling preci∣pitately into the river Eden which half in∣circles it The banks of the river and the sides of the precipice are finely hung with wood The castle is still in good repair and is a noble pile But in a picturesque light it loses half it's beauty from it's being broken into two parts A  smaller  break from a grand pile removes heaviness and is a source  of beauty We have seen the principle ex∣emplified in mountains and other objects  See page Vol II  But here the whole is divided into two parts of such  equal  dimensions that each aspires to preeminence Each therefore becomes a separate whole and both together distract the eye The detached part should always observe a due inferiority  We had not time to take a view  from  the castle which must command a very beautiful distance over the woody vale of Eden and the mountains which arise beyond it  Appelbycastle was the Apallaba of the Romans and preserves it's origin clearer in it's etymology than the generality of Roman stations  This castle was formerly the favourite man∣sion of Ann countess of Pembroke Dorset and Montgomery As this very extraordinary lady is still the object of great veneration in these parts as her history is curious and less known than it ought to be and as it is so  intimately connected with all this country the reader will excuse the following digression  She was the daughter of George Clifford earl of Cumberland one of the heroes of the gallant age of Elizabeth This noble person distinguished himself chiefly by his naval ex∣peditions on which he was suffered in those frugal times to expend a great portion of his patrimony In return for his patriotism he was appointed by his royal mistress her champion in all tilts and tournaments where the grace and dignity of his behaviour and his skill and address in arms were equally admired The rich armour he wore on these occasions is still shewn in this castle  Lady Ann Clifford was only ten years of age when her father died But her educa∣tion was conducted by two excellent women her mother a daughter of the earl of Bedford and afterwards by her aunt the countess of Warwick  In her early youth she married lord Buck∣hurst earl of Dorset with whom during a few years she lived very happily But he soon leaving her a widow she married six years after Philip earl of Pembroke and Montgomery  This nobleman through the favour of James I as a reward for his great skill in the arts of hunting and hawking possessed a prodigious estate not less at that time than eighteen thousand pounds a year His manner of living was sumptuous beyond ex∣ample and his apparatus for fieldsports magnificent beyond belief His dogkennels were superb and his stables vied with pa∣laces But his falconry was his chief pride which he had furnished at a wonderful ex∣pence with birds of game and proper per∣sons to manage train and exercise them  Here ends the history of Philip earl of Pembrokeunless we add that in private life he was vicious ignorant and unlettered in a surprizing degree and that his public character was stained with ingratitude and tergiversation by the noble historian of those unfortunate times  With this worthless man his unhappy lady lived near twenty years During the latter part of his life indeed he became so dissolute that she was obliged to leave him  About the time of his death she found her∣self possessed of a very ample fortune For it seems her immediate succession to the large estates of her ancestors in the north had been disputed by an uncle who inherited the title and an award had been given against her by James I to which indeed she would never submit The uncle and his son however both dying the great estates of the Cliffords tho considerably impaired by her father's generosity came to her without any farther molestation She had besides two great jointures That which she re∣ceived from her first husband was between three and four thousand a year and that from the earl of Pembroke was nearly equal to it  On the event of the earl of Pembroke's death she immediately laid out the whole plan of her future life determining to retire into the north and spend it on her own estate  In ancient times the earls of Cumberland possessed five noble castles in the three coun∣ties of Yorkshire Westmoreland and Cum∣berlandSkiptonPendragonAppelby Broughamand Brugh The tower of Bar∣don also was another fortified seat where they sometimes resided But all these castles had suffered in the late civil wars and were reduced more or less to a state of great decay  The countess of Pembroke however deter∣mined on her coming into the north to repair and furnish them all This great work she compleated during the years and and placed over the gate of each castle the following inscription  THIS CASTLE WAS REPAIRED BY THE LADY ANN CLIFFORD COUNTESS DOWAGER OF PEMBROKE c IN THE YEAR AFTER THE MAIN PART OF IT HAD LAIN RUINOUS EVER SINCE WHEN IT WAS DEMOLISHED ALMOST TO THE GROUND BY THE PARLIA∣MENT THEN SITTING AT WESTMINSTER BE∣CAUSE IT HAD BEEN A GARRISON IN THE CIVIL WARS IS LVIII LAUS DEO  Oliver Cromwell was at this time at the head of affairs whose hypocrisy and villany the countess of Pembroke detested and as she had too much spirit to conceal her sen∣timents it is probable the protector was enough informed how little she esteemed him Her friends therefore knowing the jealousy of his temper advised her not to be so profuse in building as they were well assured that as soon as she had built her castles he would order them to be destroyed But she answered with great spirit "Let him destroy them if he will but he shall surely find that as often as he destroys them I will rebuild them while he leaves me a shilling in my pocket"  She shewed her contempt for Cromwell and her own high spirit on another occasion Her uncle had left her affairs so involved that she found herself under a necessity of re∣covering some of her rights by a tedious law∣suit The affair being represented to Crom∣well by the opposite party he offered his mediation But she answered loftily she would never accept it while there was any  law to be found in England "What said she does he imagine that I who refused to submit to king James will submit to him"  But notwithstanding her spirit neither her castles nor her estates were injured Some ascribed this lenity to Cromwell's re∣verence of her virtue which is very im∣probable others to her numerous friends with whom the protector wished to keep fair which it is most likely was the truth  Her dislike to Cromwell was not founded on party but on principle She had the same dislike to Charles when she became acquainted with the spirit of his government On being pressed by her friends sometime after the restoration to go to court "By no means said she unless I may be allowed to wear blinkers  Blinkers are those blinds affixed to the bridles of coachhorses which prevent their seeing what they ought not to see  "  Besides her castles she found likewise in ruins almost all the churches belonging  to the several villages on her estates The spire of one had been beaten down another had been turned into a magazine a third into a hospital Seven of them were in this ruinous condition each of which she either built from the ground or repaired furnish∣ing them all with decent pews that her tenants in every part of her estates might have churches in their neighbourhood  Her several buildings and repairs at her first coming into the north did not cost her less than forty thousand pounds  At each of her castles she resided a part of every year regularly moving from one to the other thus overlooking the whole of her vast estates and blessing the country wherever she went For she was every where the common patroness of all who were dis∣tressed Her heart was as large as her abi∣lity and misery of every kind that could get it's story fairly represented to her was sure of relief  Nor was she content with  occasional  acts of charity but made many of her charitable intentions  permanent  by endowments The greatest of these works were two hospitals which she founded  One little pleasing monument of this kind stands by the side of the road between Pen∣rith and Appelby It is a monument indeed rather of her filial piety than of her charity On this spot in her early youth she had parted with her beloved mother whom she never afterwards saw She always remem∣bered this partingscene with the tenderest feelings and when she came into West∣moreland among her other buildings she raised a pillar to record it with a stonetable at it's base The pillar which is still known in the country by the name of  Countesspillar  is decorated with her arms a sun∣dial for the benefit or travellers and the following inscription  THIS PILLAR WAS ERECTED IN THE YEAR BY ANN COUNTESS DOWAGER OF PEM∣BROKE c FOR A MEMORIAL OF HER LAST PARTING IN THIS PLACE WITH HER GOOD AND PIOUS MOTHER MARGARET COUNTESS DOWAGER OF CUMBERLAND ON THE d OF APRIL IN MEMORY WHEREOF SHE HATH LEFT AN ANNUITY OF £ TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE POOR OF THE PARISH OF BROUGHAM EVERY d DAY OF APRIL FOR EVER UPON THE STONETABLE PLACED HARD BY LAUS DEO  Her very household was a noble charity Her servants were generally the children of her tenants and were sure of a provision if they behaved well Her womenservants had always little portions given them to begin the world with if they married to please her  The calamities of the times also during Cromwell's government particularly the dis∣tressed situation of several ejected ministers of the church furnished her with ample op∣portunities of exerting her generosity Among others she was particularly kind to King afterwards bishop of Chichester and Duppa and Morley both afterwards bishops of Win∣chester To each of these she allowed £ a year and when in their distresses abroad they informed her that a sum of money would be of more service to them than the annuities she was pleased to give them she remitted a thousand pounds to be divided among them  She was a lady of uncommon prudence in the management of her affairs Bishop Rain∣bow sums up her character on this head in two words by calling her a perfect mistress of  forecast  and  aftercast  For the numberless acts of bounty that flowed from her she depended on two things  her exactness in keeping accounts and her great economy  With regard to the former in whatever castle she resided an office was kept in which all her receipts and disbursements were en∣tered with commercial punctuality Of her private charities she kept an account herself but was so exact that at any time by com∣paring it with her public accounts she had at once a compleat view of the situation of her affairs  Her economy was equal to her exactness Nothing was spent in vanity Nothing was trifled away All her familyexpences were under the article of necessaries and the very form of regularity in which they constantly ran made one year a check upon another  The spirit which she shewed in defend∣ing her rights may perhaps be mentioned also among her plans of economy It was a spirit not often exerted but when it was raised it always carried her vigorously to the end of the question and no doubt secured her from many contentions which might otherwise have disturbed her in the midst of so complex a property and in those dubious  days when legal rights were so much un∣hinged I have mentioned her spirit in one suit with regard to an affair of consequence We have an account of another of less impor∣tance  It was a custom on all her estates for each tenant to pay besides his rent an an∣nual  boonhen  as it was called This had ever been acknowledged a just claim and is I believe to this day paid on many of the great estates in the north being gene∣rally considered as a steward's perquisite  It happened that a rich clothier from Ha∣lifax one Murgatroyd having taken a tene∣ment near Skipton was called upon by the steward of the castle for his  boonhen  On his refusal to pay it the countess ordered a suit to be commenced against him He was obstinate and she determined so it was car∣ried into length At last she recovered her hen but at the expence of £It is said that after the affair was decided she invited Mr Murgatroyd to dinner and draw∣ing the hen to her which was served up as the first dish "Come said she Mr Mur∣gatroyd let us now be good friends Since  you allow the hen to be dressed at my table we'll divide it between us"  She had a mind improved and cultivated in many parts of learning Dr Donn in his humourous manner used to say  she knew how to converse of every thing from predesti∣nation to sleasilk  A kind of raw silk used at that time in embroidery  But history seems to have been her chief amusement to the study of which she was probably first led by examin∣ing the history of her own ancestors This indeed comprehended in a great degree the history of England from the times of the conquest for there were few scenes of public life in which her progenitors the Veteriponts and the Cliffords an active race of men were not deeply engaged  She seems to have entertained a design of collecting materials for a history of these two potent northern families At a great expence she employed learned men to make collections for this purpose from the records in the tower the rolls and other depositaries of  public papers which being all fairly tran∣scribed filled three large volumes This work which contains a great variety of ori∣ginal characters exerting themselves on very important occasions is still among the familyrecords at Appelbycastle  While she was thus careful to preserve the honour of her ancestors she instituted a very severe historical restraint if I may so call it on herself In a large folio volume which made a part of her equipage when she tra∣velled from one castle to another she ordered an entry to be made under her own inspection of the transactions of every day To what particulars this journal extended I have not learned But if it was kept as it probably was by a confidential secretary it might have included very minute particulars What an interesting collection of valuable anecdotes might be furnished from the incidents of such a life What a satyr would it be on the vanity the dissipation and frivolous employ∣ments of the generality of the great This work I am informed is still extant and in the hands of the earl of Thanet  But the most conspicuous part of the cha∣racter of this illustrious lady was her piety and great attachment to religion No doubt the amiable instructors of her youth had given her disposition which was naturally serious a proper direction but perhaps the best school in which she had learned to think justly was that school of affliction the house of her second husband the earl of Pembroke whose dissi∣pated abandoned life taught her more than any thing else the vanity of all earthly things unless used for the purposes they were given  Few divines were better versed in scripture than she was She could quote it pertinently on all occasions and never failed to read a portion of it every day or have it read to her in the latter part of her life  The new testament was her principal study Next to it she was particularly fond of the psalms of David and had those appointed for the day read regularly to her  She had been bred up in the church of England from her youth and tho she could not in the fanatical times of the usurpation attend any public service yet in the worst  of those times she never failed to hear the churchservice in her own private chapels which she had been careful to fit up in all her castles Many menaces of sequestrations she received from the ruling powers if she persisted in that practice But she shewed the same spirit on this occasion which she had before shewn on many others She con∣tinued her practice and left them to do as they pleased No attempts however were made against her  She had no idea of pomp and grandeur With regard to herself her mode of living was rather parsimonious Amidst all the ob∣jects of her generosity herself was the only person forgotten In her diet she was even abstemious and would sometimes pleasantly boast that she had scarce ever tasted wine or physick during her whole life Of the elegance of dress she had never been fond but in her latter life she laid it intirely aside wearing nothing for many years but a close habit of plain black serge which occasioned many pleasant mistakes between her and her attendants  Her retinue was merely for use not parade Besides her common domesticks she had al∣ways  two ladies of education who lived with her Many hours she spent alone at other times they read to her and were her com∣panions  Her chief expence as far as concerned her∣self was in books Her library was stored with all the best writers in the English lan∣guage She knew no other  Such was the life of this excellent lady equally suited to any station in which God had pleased to place her It was a life of no more indulgence than the most abridged circumstances would have allowed Her abi∣lity in doing good was that only in which she exceeded others  She lived twentysix years after the death of her second husband Providence lengthen∣ing out her life as a blessing to the country beyond her eightieth year The d of March was the day of her dissolutionone of the most melancholy days the northern coun∣ties ever experienced  In her ended the noble family of the Clif∣fords Her daughter Margaret by the earl of Dorset her sole surviving heiress marry∣ing  the earl of Thanet carried the Clifford estates into the Tufton family  The most material part of this little history is taken from a MS life of Mr Sedgwick her secretary written by himself In this work Mr Sedgwick occasionally inserts a few circumstances relating to his ladyIt is a pity he had not given her the better share His MS is still extant in Appelbycastle    SECT XXIV  FROM Appelbycastle we soon approach the barriermountains but we approach them in the usual order of nature by regular progress The ground is first high before it becomes mountainous and tillage appears in scanty plots before cultivation ceases  A little to the north of Brugh the ground on the left makes a singular appearance A hill on which a fair is annually held forms an exact semicircular convex Scarce a knoll or bush break the regularity of the line Be∣yond this but without any intervening ground rises a range of distant mountains These wore a light purple hue when we saw them the circular hill a deep green Perhaps no disposition of ground was ever more totally  unpicturesque and yet even this such is the force of contrast if it be only bisected and in a small degree adorned is not wholly dis∣agreeable  At the commencement of the mountains stand the town and castle of Brugh not unpleasantly seated The castle which con∣sists like that at Appelby of two parts seems to have been a very strong place Since the time of it's last noble inhabitant the countess of Pembroke it has been falling fast into ruin but we found it no easy matter even yet to scale the outworks of it's earthen mounds so strong a fortress hath it once beenSome parts of it especially a shattered round tower are very picturesque  We had not the opportunity of seeing this castle in so advantageous a light as had fa∣voured us when we saw the castle of Penrith We saw them both in the evening but here we had no bright beam of sunset to  illumine the ruins  And yet the effect was grand The castle and landscape around were in deep shadow under the influence of a retiring storm which had hung a settled gloom on all  the upper regions of the sky The sun was invisible but had fired the whole western horizon with a deep red We viewed the castle from the east and had therefore the ruddy part of the hemisphere as a background to the grey tints and strong shadows of the towers and battlements which intervened These with the deep solemnity of the gloom were a suffi∣cient balance to the glowing red of the horizon which would otherwise have been too glaring But the whole was in perfect harmony and had a fine effectIndeed nature's  colouring  is rarely without harmony If the lights be glowing the shades are proportionably deep on the contrary if the lights decay the sha∣dows decay with them and as light is also the source of colour the landscape wears always one uniform hue Either the  sober colouring  prevails or one  vivid tint  supports another In  composition  See the idea of improving natural composition ex∣plained p c Vol I  we have found that nature may be improved but in the beauty and proportion of her tints in the harmony  of her colouring she is an undeviating model of perfection  The square tower which made the grand part of the castle conveyed as we looked into it a very horrid idea Most of these old structures have suffered great  external  dilapi∣dations But here the  shell  was intire and all the  internal  parts were gonethe roof the stories and even the vault over the dun∣geon The whole was a mere excavation I know not that I was ever struck with a more horrid idea of the kind The eye confined within the walls of a vast tower open to the sky above which loured with unusual black∣ness looked down with hideous contrast deep into a dungeon below  The whole road over the mountains of Stainmore from Brughcastle to Bowescastle which is about thirteen miles is the most unpleasant that can be conceived and the more so as it reminded us of the sublime scenes which we had passed in another part of this chain between Ambleside and Keswick  In the mountains of Stainmore the parts are neither sufficiently ample to be grand nor rich and varied to be beautiful We did not even find what we have elsewhere called  a mere scene of mountains  See page Vol I  In such a scene the  parts  are beautiful tho there is no  whole  but here in a picturesque view there is neither  whole  nor  parts  Nothing remains of Bowescastle but one heavy square tower much defaced and ruin∣ed tho the stonework appears to have been excellent This fortress seems originally to have been intended as a defence at the southern end of the mountains as Brughcastle was at the northern  From the position of these castles it seems probable that formerly the road over the mountains of Stainmore was the only road into Cumberland that was passable and of course necessary to be defended The Keswick moun∣tains  till lately were imp  rvious and the mountains of Shap are much fuller of defiles and dangerous passes than those of Stainmore which are the most level and the most pene∣trable part of this vast chain  As we leave the mountains a very rich and extensive view opens before us into Yorkshire We had not seen such a view for many days For tho in Cumberland we had many very extensive prospects yet they extended chiefly over barren country  At Grata we found much devastation from the late high floods The bridge was beaten down and large fragments of it carried away through the violence of the stream many hundred yards With these and huge stones torn from the adjoining cliffs the bed of the river was choaked Nothing could have a more ruinous appearance A broken bridge impresses one of the strongest emblems of desolation from the idea of cutting off all intercourse among men  Here Sir Thomas Robinson has a house  It is now Mr Morritt's  situated in a pleasant park one side of which is bounded by the river  The road from Gratabridge leads through a rich country but open and unpleasing unless in distance  The middle of Gatherlymoor commands a most extensive view in every direction Hambledonhills bound the prospect in front On the right stretches an extent of country towards Richmond A distance still more remote opens on the left into the bishopric of Durham and behind rise the mountains of Westmoreland as a background to all the wild scenes we had left  Few places afford a situation where a painter may see at once so many  modes of distance  or where he may better compare at one glance their several beauties and imperfections  The wild unwooded waste when thrown into distance hath neither variety nor rich∣ness It is one uniform dark and dreary spread unless it be happily inlightened or consist of hilly ground broken into large parts  The intermixture of tracts of woodland adds a pleasing variety to distance and is adapted to receive the sweetest effects of light  But the cultivated country forms the most amusing distance  See page Vol I  Meadows cornfields hedgerows spires towns and villages tho lost as  single objects  are all melted together into the  richest mass of variegated surface  over which the eye ranges with delight and following the flitting gleams of sunshine catches a thousand dubious objects as they arise and creates as many more which do not really exist But such a country will not bear a nearer approach especially if it be overbuilt which is the case of most of the rich distances about London the  parts  assume too much consequence and the  whole  becomes a scene of confusion  When the death of Elizabeth called James to the crown of England he took this road from Scotland and on Gatherlymoor we are told he stopped to take a view around him with which he is said to have been greatly delighted The spot where this royal survey was taken is still shewnthe summit of a Roman stationIt is not likely that picturesque thoughts engaged his princely attention at that time It is rather probable that he began here to measure the length of his new sceptrefor here his wistful eyes were blessed with the first fair prospect of the pro∣mised land  From Gatherlymoor we entered Leeming∣lane grieved to leave so much fine country on both sides unseen Within a few miles the Tees pouring through a rocky channel forms some of the most romantic scenery in England and boasts at Winstonbridge a more magnificent single arch than perhaps any English river can produceWithin a few miles in another direction lie the beautiful  and varied grounds about Richmond which among other noble scenes exhibit the magni∣ficent ruins of a castle on the summit of a lofty rock overhanging the SwaleAll these beautiful scenes we were obliged to leave behind and enter Leeminglane which ex∣tends near thirty miles in a straight line shut up between hedges being a part of a great Roman causey And yet the whole is so well planted that we found it less disgusting than we expected The smallest turn where the wood hung loosely over the lane especially when there was any variety in the ground broke the lines and destroyed much of the disagreeable regularity of the road  We left the lane however abruptly and went to Norton Conyers near Rippon the seat of Sir Bellingham Graham from whence we proposed to visit the neighbouring scenes of Studley and Hackfall  SECT XXV  THE most improved part of the gardens at Studley and what is chiefly shewn to strangers is a valley nearly circular sur∣rounded by high woody grounds which slope gently into it in various directions The cir∣cumference of the higher grounds includes about one hundred and fifty acres the area at the bottom consists of eight The higher parts present many openings into the country The lower of course are more confined but might afford many pleasing woody scenes and solitary retreats A considerable stream runs through the valley and on the banks of this stream in another valley contiguous to the circular one stand the ruins of Fountain's abbey the grandest and most beautiful except perhaps those of Glastonbury which the kingdom can produce  The idea which such a scene naturally suggests is that of retirementthe habitation of chearful solitude Every object points it out all tending to sooth and amuse but not to rouse and transport like the great scenes of nature  Sometimes indeed the recluse may be more enamoured of the great scenes of nature and wish to fix his abode where his eye may be continually presented with sublime ideas But in general we observe from the whole history of monastic life that he wishes rather to sequester himself in some tranquil scene and this in particular was chosen as a quiet recess consecrated to retirement  Solitude therefore being the reigning idea of the scene every accompaniment should tend to impress it The ruins of the abbey which is the great object of the place certainly do The river and the paths should wind carelesly through the lawns and woods with little decoration Buildings should be sparingly introduced Those which appear should be as simple as possiblethe mere retreats of solitude The scene allows no more and the  neighbourhood of so noble a ruin renders every other decoration in the way of building either trivial or offensive  Instead of these ideas which the scenes of Studley naturally suggest the whole is a vain ostentation of expence a mere  Timon's villa  decorated by a taste debauched in it's concep∣tions and puerile in it's execution Not only the reigning idea of the place is forgotten but all the great masterstrokes of nature in every shape are effaced Every part is touched and retouched with the insipid sedulity of a Dutch master  Labor improbus omnia vincit  What a lovely scene might a person of pure taste have made at Studley with one tenth part of the expence which hath been laid out in deforming it  Fresh shadows fit to shroud from sunny ray  Fair lawns to take the sun in season due  Sweet springs in which a thousand nymphs did play  Soft tumbling brooks that gentle slumber drew  High reared mounts the lands about to view  Lowwinding dales disloigned from common gaze  Delightful bowers to solace lovers true  Such might have been the scenes of Studley but such is the whimsical channel of human operations that we sometimes see the pencil of Reubens employed on a country wake and that of Teniers disgracing the nuptials of an emperor  On the whole it is hard to say whether nature has done more to embellish the scenes of Studley or art to deform them Much indeed is below criticism But even where the rules of more genuine taste have been adopted they are for the most part unhappily misapplied In the point of opening views for instance few of the openings here are simple and natural The artifice is apparent The marks of the sheers and hatchet are conspicuous in them all Whereas half the beauty of a thing consists in the easiness of it's introduction Bring in your story awk∣wardly and it offends It is thus in a view The eye roving at large in quest of objects cannot bear prescription Every thing forced  upon it disgusts and when it is apparent that the view is  contrived  the  effect is lost  The valley in which Fountain's abbey stands is not of larger dimensions than the other we have just described but instead of the circular form it winds in a more beautiful proportion into length It's sides are com∣posed of woody hills sloping down in varied declivities and uniting with the trees at the bottom which adorn the river  At one end of this valley stand the ruins of the abbey which formerly overspread a large space of ground Besides the grand remains of ruin there appeared in various parts among the trees and bushes detached fragments which were once the appendages of this great house One of these which was much ad∣mired seemed evidently to have been a court of justice  Such was the general idea of this beautiful valley and of the ruins which adorned it before they fell into the hands of the present proprietor Long had he wished to draw them  within the circle of his improvements but some difficulties of law withstood At length they were removed and the time came which every lover of picturesque beauty must lament when the legal possession of this beautiful scene was yielded to him and his busy hands were let loose upon it He found it indeed some∣what ruder than even picturesque beauty required and a little might have been well done But  his improvements  have had no bounds He has pared away all the bold roughness and freedom of the scene and given every part a trim polish  A few fragments lying scattered around the body of a ruin are  proper  and  picturesque  They are  proper  because they account for what is defaced and they are  picturesque  because they unite the principal pile with the ground on which union the beauty of com∣position in a good measure depends  See the same idea in mountains p Vol II and in building p and afterwards in cattle Sect XXXI  But here they were thought rough and unsightly and fell a sacrifice to neatness Even the court of justice was not spared tho a  fragment probably as beautiful as it was curious  In the room of these detached fragments which were the proper and picturesque em∣bellishments of the scene a gaudy temple is erected and other trumpery wholly foreign to itIt is a difficult matter at the sight of such monstrous absurdities to keep resent∣ment within decent bounds I hope I have not exceeded  But not only the scenery is defaced and the outworks of the ruin violently torn away the main body of the ruin itself is at this very time under the alarming hand of decoration  The remains of this pile are very magnifi∣cent Almost the intire skeleton of the abbeychurch is left which is a beautiful piece of Gothic architecture The tower seems wholly to have escaped the injuries of time It's mouldering lines only are softened Near the church stand a double row of cloysters which are singularly curious from the pointed arches which do the office of columns in supporting the roof At the end of these cloysters stand the abbot's apartments which open into a court called the Monk'sgarden On one  side of this court is the hall a noble room which communicates in the spirit of hospi∣tality with the kitchen There are besides a few other detached parts  When the present proprietor made his pur∣chase he found this whole mass of ruin the cloysters the abbeychurch and the hall choaked with rubbish His first work there∣fore was to clear and open And  something  in this way as I have just observed might have been done with propriety For we see ruins sometimes so choaked that no view of them can be obtained  To this business succeeded the great work of  restoring  and  ornamenting  This required a very delicate touch Among the ruins were found scraps of Gothic windows small mar∣ble columns tiles of different colours and a variety of other ornamental fragments These the proprietor has picked from the rubbish with great care and with infinite industry is now restoring to their old situation But in vain for the friability of the edges of every fracture makes any restoration of parts an awkward patchwork  Indeed the very idea of giving a finished splendor to a ruin is absurd How unnatural in a place evidently forlorn and deserted by man are the  recent  marks of human industry Besides every sentiment which the scene suggests is destroyed Instead of that sooth∣ing melancholy on which the mind feeds in contemplating the ruins of time a sort of jargon is excited by these heterogeneous mix∣tures as if when some grand chorus had taken possession of the soulwhen the sounds in all their sublimity were yet vibrating on the eara light jig should strike up  But the  restoration  of parts is not enough  ornaments  must be added and such incon∣gruous ornaments as disgraced the  scene  are disgracing also the  ruin  The monk's  garden  is turned into a trim parterre and planted with flowering shrubs a view is opened through the great window to some ridiculous figure I know not what Ann Bolein I think they called it that is placed in the valley and in the central part of the abbeychurch a circular pedestal is raised out of the fragments of the  old pavement on which is erecteda muti∣lated heathen statue  A  legal  right the proprietor  has to deform his ruin as he  he fear no indictment in the  must expect a very severe  court of taste The refined code of  does not consider an elegant ruin  property  on which he may exercise  ill the irregular sallies of a wanton imagination but as a deposit of which he is only the guardian for the amusement and admiration of posterityA ruin is a sacred thing Root∣ed for ages in the soil assimilated to it and become as it were a part of it we consider it as a work of nature rather than of art Art cannot reach it A Gothic window a fretted arch some trivial peculiarity may have been aimed at with success but the  magnifi∣cence  of ruin was never attained by any modern attempt  What reverence then is due to these sacred relics which the rough hand of temerity and caprice dare mangle without remorse The least error is irretrievable Let us pause a  momentA Goth may deform but it ex∣ceeds the power of art to amend  The scenes of Studley which I have here described are confined to the two contiguous vallies The improvements of the place extend considerably farther but we had neither time nor inclination to examine more We had seen enough  About the close of the last century a piece of human antiquity existed in the neighbour∣hood of this abbey still more curious than the abbey itselfthat venerable instance of longevity Henry Jenkins Among all the events which in the course of a hundred and sixtynine years had fastened upon the memory of this singular man he spoke of nothing with so much emotion as the ancient state of Foun∣tain's abbey If he were ever questioned on that subject he would be sure to inform you "What a brave place it had once been" and would speak with much feeling of the clamour which it's dissolution occasioned in the coun∣try  The substance of these particulars the author had from a MS shewn him by Sir Bellingham Graham  "About a hundred and thirty years ago he would say when I was butler to lord Conyers and old Marmaduke Bradley now dead and gone was lordabbot I was often sent by my lord to inquire after the lordabbot's health and the lord abbot would always send for me up into his chamber and would order me roastbeef  The MS says  a quarter of a yard  of roastbeef I have heard that the monasteries used to measure out their beef but in what way I never understood  and wassel which I remem∣ber well was always brought in a  blackjack  " From this account we see what it was that rivetted Fountain's abbey so distinctly in the old man's memory The  blackjack  I doubt not was a stronger idea than all the splendor of the house or all the virtues of the lordabbot  SECT XXVI  FROM Studley we visited the scenes of Hackfall These own the same pro∣prietor and are adorned with equal taste  It is a circumstance of great advantage when you are carried to this grand exhibition as you always should be through the  close lanes  of the Rippon road You have not the least intimation of a design upon you nor any suggestion that you are on high grounds till the foldingdoors of the building at Mow∣braypoint being thrown open you are struck with one of the grandest and most beautiful bursts of country that the imagination can form  Your eye is first carried many fathoms pre∣cipitately down a bold woody steep to the river Ewer which forms a large semicircular  curve below winding to the very foot of the precipice on which you stand The trees of the precipice overhang the central part of the curve  In other parts too the river is intercepted by woods but enough of it is discovered to leave the eye at no uncertainty in tracing it's course At the two opposite points of the curve two promontories shoot into the river in contrast with each other that on the right is woody faced with rock and crowned with a castle that on the left rises smooth from the water and is scattered over with a few clumps The peninsular part and the grounds also at some distance beyond the isthmus con∣sist of one intire woody scene which ad∣vancing boldly to the front of the precipice unites itself with it  This woody scenery on the banks of the river may be called the first distance Beyond this lies a rich extensive countrybroken into large partsdecorated with all the ob∣jects and diversified with all the tints of distant landscaperetiring from the eye scene after scenetill at length every vivid hue fading gradually away and all distinction of parts being lost the country imperceptibly  melts into the horizon except in some parts where the blue hills of Hambledon close the view  Through the whole extent of this grand scenethis delightful gradation of light and coloursnature has wrought with her broadest and freest pencil The parts are ample the composition perfectly correct She hath ad∣mitted nothing disgusting or even trivial I scarce remember any where an extensive view so full of beauties and so free from faults The foreground is as pleasing as the back∣ground which it never can be when plots of cultivation approach the eye and it is rare to find so large an extent of nearground covered by wood or other surface whose parts are alike grand and beautiful  The vale of which this view is composed hath not yet intirely lost it's ancient name the  vale of Mowbray  so called from Mow∣braycastle now no longer traced even in it's ruins but once supposed to be the capital mansion of these wide domains This vale extends from York almost to the confines of Durham is adorned by the Swale and the Ewer both considerable rivers and is cer∣tainly  one of the noblest tracts of country of the kind in England  Hackfall is as much a contrast to Studley as the idea of  magnificence  is to that of  solitude  It requires of course a different mode of or∣nament A banqueting house inriched with every elegance of architecture in the form perhaps of a Grecian temple might be a proper decoration at Mowbraypoint which at Studley would be superfluous and absurd The ruins of a castle too if they  could  be ex∣ecuted with verisimilitude and grandeur might adorn the rocky promontory on the right with propriety The present ruin is a paltry thing Any other ornamental building besides these two I should suppose unnecessary These might sufficiently adorn every part of the scenery both in the higher and in the lower grounds If the expence which is generally laid out in our great gardens on a variety of  little  buildings was confined to one or two  capital objects  the general effect would be better A profusion of buildings is one of the extravagances of false taste  One  ob∣ject is a proper ornament in every scene more  than one at least on the foregrounds distract it Particular circumstances indeed may add a  propriety  to a greater number of objects as at Kew where a specimen is given of dif∣ferent kinds of religious structures or at Chis∣wick where it is intended to exhibit an idea of various modes of architecture But it is  unity  of  design  not of  picturesque composition  which pleases us in these scenes As far as this is concerned one handsome object is enough  Having examined the whole of this very extraordinary burst of landscape from Mow∣braypoint we descended to the bottom where a great variety of grand and pleasing views are exhibited particularly a view of Mow∣braypoint from Limushill and another of the promontory with the castle upon it from the tent and it must be acknowledged that many of these scenes are opened in a very natural and masterly manner If any art hath been used it hath been used with dis∣cretion  At the same time amidst all this profusion of great objects and all this grandeur of  de∣sign  for nature has here not only brought her materials together but has composed them likewise the eye is every where called aside from the contemplation of them by some tri∣vial objectan awkward cascadea fountain a view through a hole cut in a woodor some other ridiculous specimen of absurd taste  It is a great happiness however that the improver of these scenes had less in his power at Hackfall than he had at Studley The vallies there and homeviews were all with∣in the reach of his spade and axe Here he could only contemplate at a distance what glorious scenes he might have displayed if his arm could have extended to the horizon Some of the nearer grounds of this grand ex∣hibition I believe all beyond the Ewer are the property of another person So that the whole peninsular part and the grounds immediately beyond it continue sacred and untouched and these are the scenes which form the grand part of the view from Mow∣braypoint In surveying these the eye over∣looks the puerilities of improvement at the bottom of the precipice  The banks of rivers are so various that I know not any two riverviews of any celebrity which at all resemble each other in the  detail  though in the  general cast and outlines  of the scene they agree Thus at Studley and at  See page  Corby the materials of the scenery are in both places the same Each hath it's woody banksit's riverand the ruins of an abbey In each also the beauties of the scene are in a great measure shut up within itself and the idea of solitude is impressed on both Notwith∣standing this similarity two scenes can hardly be more different At Corby the woody bank is grander than that at Studley border∣ing rather on the sublime At Studley the form and contrast of the vallies and great variety of the ground is more pleasing In the former scene the river is superior in the latter the ruins In one you wander about the mazes of a circular woody bank in the other the principal part of the walk is con∣tinued along the margin of the river the  woody bank which is too steep to admit a path serving only as a skreen  There is the same union and difference be∣tween the scenes of Persfield  See observations on the Wye page  and Hackfall Both are  great  and  commanding  situations The river in both forms a  sweeping curve  Both are adorned with  rocks and woods  and sublimity is the reigning idea of each Not∣withstanding all these points of union they are wholly unlike Persfield though the country is open before it depends little on it's beauties It's own wild winding banks supply an endless variety of rocky scenery which is sufficient to engage the attention The banks of Hackfall are less magnificent tho it's river is more picturesque and it's woods more beautiful But it's views into the country are it's pride and beyond any com∣parison grander and more inchanting than those at Persfield  From Hackfall we returned to our hospi∣table quarters at  Norton Conyers  which is  situated in a pleasant parkscene but too flat to admit much variety  In the time of the civil wars the owner of this mansion was Sir Richard Graham of whom we heard an anecdote in the family which is worth relating as it is not only curious in itself but throws a very strong and yet natural shade on the character of Cromwell  When the affairs of Charles I were in their wane in all the southern counties the marquiss of Newcastle's prudence gave them some credit in the north His residence was at York where he engaged two of the gen∣tlemen of the country to act under him as lieutenants Sir Richard Graham was one whose commission under the marquiss is still in the hands of the family As Sir Richard was both an active man and much attached to the royal cause he entered into it with all that vigour which ability inspired by in∣clination could exert and did the king more effectual service than perhaps any private gentleman in those parts  On that fatal day when the precipitancy of prince Rupert in opposition to the sage advice of the marquiss led the king's forces out of York against Cromwell who waited for them on Marsdenmoor Sir Richard Gra∣ham had a principal command and no man did more than he to end an action with suc∣cess which had been undertaken with teme∣rity  When the day was irretrievably lost and nothing remained but for every man to seek the best means of security that offered Sir Richard fled with twentysix bleeding wounds upon him to his own house at Norton Con∣yers about fifteen miles from the field Here he arrived in the evening and being spent with loss of blood and fatigue he was car∣ried into his chamber where taking a last farewell of his disconsolate lady he expired  Cromwell who had ever expressed a pecu∣liar inveteracy against this gentleman and thought a victory only half obtained if he escaped pursued his flight in person with a troop of horse  When he arrived at Norton his gallant enemy was dead having scarce lived an hour  after he was carried into his chamber and Cromwell found his wretched lady weeping over the mangled corpse of her husband yet scarce cold  Such a sight one would have imagined might have given himnot indeed an emo∣tion of pitybut at least a satiety of revenge The inhuman miscreant still felt the vengeance of his soul unsatisfied and turning round to his troopers who had stalked after him into the sacred recesses of sorrow he gave the sign of havoc and in a few moments the whole house was torn in pieces not even the bed was spared on which the mangled body was extended and every thing was destroyed which the hands of rapine could not carry off  In this country we met with another cu∣rious memorial of the battle of Marsdenmoor A carpenter about two years ago bought some trees which had grown there But when the timber was brought to the sawpit it was found very refractory On examining it with more attention it appeared that great  numbers of leaden bullets were in the hearts of several of the trees which thus recorded the very spot where the heat of the battle had raged  SECT XXVII  FROM Norton we proposed to take our rout through Yorkshire into Derby∣shire and so through the other midland counties into the south of England  The town of Rippon makes a better ap∣pearance as you approach it than the gene∣rality of country towns The church is a large building and gives a consequence to the place  From Rippon the road is not unpleasant passing generally through a woody country till we entered Knaresboroughforest where all wood ceased Like other royal chases it hath now lost all it's sylvan honours and is a wild bleak unornamented tract of country  Near the close of the forest lies Harrogate in the dip of a hill a cheerless unpleasant village Nor does the country make any change for the better till we cross the ri∣ver Wharf  From hence leaving the ruins of Hare∣woodcastle on the left and Harewoodhouse on the right the ancient and modern seats of the family of Lascelles we ascended by degrees a tract of high ground and had an extensive view which was illumined when we saw it by those gleaming cursory lights which are so beautiful in distant landscape and so common when the incidents of a bright sun a windy sky and floating clouds co∣incide It is amusing under these circum∣stances to pursue the flitting gleams as they spread decay and vanishthen rise in some other part varied by the different surfaces over which they spread  We have this appearance beautifully de∣tailed in an old Erse poem the title of which is Dargo The bard poetically and pictu∣resquely  compares the short transitions of joy in the mind to these transitory gleams of light  "The tales of the years that are past are beams of light to the soul of the bard They are like the sunbeams that travel over the heaths of Morven Joy is in their course tho darkness dwells around Joy is in their course but it is soon past the shades of darkness pursue them they overtake them on the mountains and the footsteps of the chearful beam are no longer discoveredThus the tale of Dargo travels over my soul like a beam of light tho the gathering of the clouds is behind"  We should have been glad to have ex∣amined Harewoodhouse as it is a sumptuous pile but it is shewn only on particular days and we happened to be there on a wrong one  We regretted also another misfortune of the same kind for which we had only our∣selves to blame and that was the omission of Kirkstallabbey In the precipitancy of  an early morning and through an unaccount∣able error in geography we passed it and did not recollect the mistake till we were half a day's journey beyond it  Around Leeds the soil wears an unpleasant hue owing in part to the dirtiness of the surface within a few yards of which coal is every where foundThe country however changes greatly for the better before we ar∣rive at Wakefield which lies in the midst of beautiful scenery The river Calder makes a fine appearance as we leave the town and it's banks are adorned by a Gothic cha∣pel now in ruins dedicated by Edward IV to the memory of the duke of York his fa∣ther and the other chiefs of his party who fell at the battle of Wakefield It is built in the elegant proportion of ten by six plain on the sides but richly adorned on the front and finished with a small octagon turret at the east endThis little edifice serves both to ascertain the history of architecture which appears to have been near it's meridian and to illustrate an important part of the English story It's whimsical situation by the side  of a bridge was intended probably to mark the spot where some principal part of the action happened tho at the entrance of great towns it was not unusual in popish times to place chapels on bridges that travellers might immediately have the benefit of a mass There was for this purpose a chapel formerly in one of the piers of Londonbridge  Not far from Wakefield we rode past a piece of water which takes the humble name of a millpond but is in fact a beautiful little lake being near two miles in circum∣ference and containing some pleasing scenery along it's little woody shores and promon∣tories  From Banktop we had a good descending view of Wentworthcastleof the grounds which inviron itand the country which surrounds it The scene all together is grand The eminence on which we stood is adorned with a great profusion of something in the way of an artificial ruin It is possible it may have an effect from the castle below  but  on the spot  it is certainly no orna∣ment We found some difficulty in passing through lord Strafford's park and proceeded therefore to Wentworthhouse which is a superb and is esteemed an elegant pile but there seems to be a want of simplicity about it The front appears broken into too many parts and the inside incumbered A sim∣ple plan has certainly more dignity Such for instance is lord Tinley's house at Wan∣stead where the whole is intelligible  at sight  The hall at lord Rockingham's is a cube of sixty feet The gallery is what they call a  shelf  For myself I saw nothing offensive in it tho it is undoubtedly a more masterly contrivance to raise a gallery  upon  a wall than to affix one  to it  The long gallery is a noble apartment and the interception of a breakfast room from it by pillars and an oc∣casional curtain gives a pleasant combined idea of retirement and company The li∣brary also is grand  There are few good pictures at Wentworth the original of lord Strafford and his secre∣tary is said to be here It's pretensions are disputed tho I think it has merit enough to maintain them any whereThere is an∣other  good portrait by Vandyke of the same nobleman He rests his hand upon a dog and his head in this picture is perhaps supe∣rior to that of the otherHere is also by Vandyke a son of the same earl with his two sisters The management of the whole displeases but the boy is delightfully painted  Wentworthhouse stands low It's front commands an extensive plain and a flat dis∣tant country which are seen betwixt a ri∣sing wood on the left and a variety of cross∣ing lawns on the right On the whole I was not much pleased with any thing I saw here  SECT XXVIII  FROM Wentworthhouse the same plea∣sant face of country continues to Sheffield But it soon begins to change as we approach Derbyshire The rising grounds become in∣sensibly more wild rocks start every where from the soil and a new country comes on apace For we now approached that great central tract of high lands which arising in these parts form themselves into moun∣tains and spreading here and there run on without interruption as far as Scotland  See page Vol I  Before we reach Middleton the whole face of the land has suffered change and we see nothing around us but wildness and desola∣tion  About two miles short of Middleton we are cheared again by a beautiful valley which participates indeed of the wildness of the coun∣try but is both finely wooded and watered In a recess of this valley stands Middleton a very romantic village beyond which the valley still continues two miles farther  It is this  continuation  of it which is known by the name of Middletondale and is esteemed one of the most romantic scenes of the country It is a narrow winding chasm hardly broader than to give space for a road On the right it is rocky on the left the hills wear a smoother form The rocks are grey tinged in many parts with plots of ver∣dure insinuating themselves and running among them Some of these rocks assume a peculiar form rearing themselves like the round towers and buttresses of a ruined castle and their upper strata running in parallel directions take the form of cornices The  turriti scopuli  of Virgil cannot be illustrated better  When we leave Middletondale the wastes of Derbyshire open before us and wear the same face as those we had left behind on the  borders of Yorkshire They are tracts of coarse moorish pasturage forming vast con∣vex sweeps without any intersection of line or variation of ground divided into portions by stone walls without a cottage to diversisy the scene or a tree to enliven it Middleton∣dale is the pass which unites these two dreary scenes  Having travelled several miles in this high country in our way to Castleton we came at length to the edge of a precipice down which ran a long steep descent From the brow an extensive vale lay before us It's name is Hopedale It is a wide open scene of cultivation the sides of which tho moun∣tainous are tilled to the top The village of Hope stands at one end of it and Castleton at the other In a direction towards the middle of this vale we descended The object of our pursuit was that celebrated chasm near Castleton called the  Devil's cave  A descent of two miles brought us to it A combination of more horrid ideas is rarely  found than this place affords It exceeded our liveliest imagination  A rocky mountain rises to a great height in most parts perpendicular in some beetling over it's base As it ascends it divides forming at the top two rocky summits  On one of these summits stands an old castle the battlements of which appear to grow out of the rock It's situation on the edge of a precipice is tremendous Looking up from the bottom you may trace a narrow path formed merely by the adventrous foot of cu∣riosity winding here and there round the walls of the castle which as far as appears is the only road which leads to it  The other rock reserves it's terrors for the bottom There it opens into that tremendous chasm called the Devil's cave Few places have more the air of the poetical regions of Tartarus  The combination of a castle and a cave which we have here in  reality  Virgil  feigns  with a view perhaps of giving an additional terror to each  Aeneas arces quibus altus Apollo  Praesidet horrendaeque procul secreta Sibyllae  Antrum immane petit  The poet does not give the detail of his  antrum immane  if he had he could not have con∣ceived more interesting circumstances than are here brought together  A towering rock hangs over you under which you enter an arched cavern twelve yards high forty wide and near a hundred long So vast a canopy of  unpillared  rock stretching over your head gives you an involuntary shud∣der A strong light at the mouth of the cave displays all the horrors of the  entrance  in full proportion But this light decaying as you proceed the imagination is left to explore it's deeper caverns by torchlight which gives them additional terror At the end of the first cavern runs a river above forty feet wide over which you are ferried into a seeond of dimensions vaster than the first It is known by the name of the Cathedral The height of it is horribly discovered by a few spiracles at the top through which you see the light of the day without being able at such a distance to enjoy the least benefit from it Beyond this cavern flows another branch of the same river which becomes the boundary of other caverns still more remote But this was farther than we chose to proceed I never found any pictu∣resque  beauty in the interior regions of the earth and the idea growing too infernal we were glad to return  coeli melioris ad auras  The inhabitants of these scenes are as savage as the scenes themselves We were reminded by a disagreeable contrast of the pleasing sim∣plicity and civility of manners which we found among the lakes and mountains of Cumberland Here a wild uninformed stare through matted dishevelled locks marks every feature and the traveller is followed like a spectacle by a croud of gazers Many of these miserable people live under the tremendous roof we have just described where a manufacture of ropeyarn is carried on One poor wretch has erected a hut within it's verge where she has lived these forty years A little straw suffices for a roof which has only to resist the drop∣pings of unwholesome vapour from the top of the cavern  The exit from Hopedale in our road to Buxton is not inferior to the scene we had  left We ascend a straining steep ornamented on each side with bold projecting rocks most of which are picturesque tho some of them are rather fantastic  As we leave this pass on our right appears  Mamtor  surnamed the  Shivering mountain  A part of it's side has the appearance of a cas∣cade down which it continually discharges the flaky substance of which it is composed  On the confines of this mountain and but a little below the surface is found that curious variegated mineral which is formed into small ornamental obelisks urns and vases It is supposed to be a petrifaction and is known in London by the name of the  Derbyshire drop  But on the spot it is called  Blue John  from the beautiful blue veins which overspread the finest parts of it Where it wears a yellowish hue the vein is coarsest in many parts it is beautifully honeycombed and transparent The proprietors of the marble works at Ash∣ford farmed the quarry of this curious mineral  last year at ninetyfive pounds and it is thought have nearly exhausted it  From Hopedale to Buxton the country is dreary and uncomfortable The eye ranges over bleak wastes such as we had seen before divided every where by stone walls The pas∣turage in many parts seems good as the fields were stocked with cattle but hardly a tree or a house appears through the whole district  In a bottom in this uncomfortable country lies Buxton surrounded with dreary barren hills and streaming on every side with offen∣sive limekilns Nothing but absolute want of health could make a man endure a scene so wholly disgusting  Near Buxton we visited another horrid cave called  Pool's hole  but it wants those magni∣ficent accompaniments of  external  scenery which we found at the Devil's cave  The same dreary face of country continues from Buxton to Ashford Here we fall into a beautiful vale fringed with wood and watered by a brilliant stream which recalled to our memory the pleasing scenes of this kind we had met with among the mountains of Cum∣berland  At Ashford is carried on a manufactory of marble dug on the spot some of which curiously incrusted with shells is very beau∣tiful  The vale of Ashford continues with little interruption to Bakewell where it enters another sweet valethe vale of Haddon so called from Haddonhall a magnificent old mansion which stands in the middle of it on a rocky knoll incompassed with wood  This princely structure scarce yet in a state of ruin is able it is said to trace it's origin into times before the conquest It then wore a military form In after ages it became  possessed by different noble families and about the beginning of this century was inhabited by the dukes of Rutland Since that time it has been neglected Many fragments of it's ancient grandeur remainsculptured chim∣nies fretted cornices patches of costly ta∣pestry  Auratasque trabes veterum decora alta parentum  Not far from hence lies Chatsworth in a situation naturally bleak but rendered not unpleasant by it's accompaniments of wellgrown wood  Chatsworth was the glory of the last age when trim parterres and formal waterworks were in fashion It  then  acquired a celebrity which it has never lost tho it has  now  many rivals A good approach has been made to it but in other respects when we saw it it's invirons had not kept pace with the improve∣ments of the times Many of the old formali∣ties remained But a dozen years no doubt have introduced much improvement  The house itself would have been no way striking except in the wilds of Derbyshire The chapel is magnificent It is adorned on  the whole of one side by a fresco representing Christ employed in works of charity  There are few pictures in the house A portrait of the late duke of Cumberland by Reynolds was the best But there is much exquisite carving by the hand of Gibbons We admired chiefly the dead fowl of various kinds with which the chimney of one of the state rooms is adorned It is astonishing to see the downy softness of feathers given to wood The particulars however alone are admirable Gib∣bons was no adept at composition  From Chatsworth through Darleydale a sweet extensive scene we approached Matlock  The rocky scenery about the bridge is the first grand specimen of what we were to expect  As we advanced towards the boathouse the views became more interesting  Soon after the  great Torr  appeared which is a most magnificent rock decorated with wood and stained with various hues yellow green and greyOn the opposite side the rocks contracting the road slope diagonally  These straits open into the vale of Matlock a romantic and most delightful scene in which  the ideas of sublimity and beauty are blended in a high degree It extends about two miles in length and in the widest parts is half a mile broad The area consists of much irre∣gular ground The right hand bank has little consequence except that of shaping the vale It is the left hand bank which ennobles the scene This very magnificent rampart rising in a semicircular form is divided into four ample faces of rock with an interruption of wood between each The first which you approach is the highest but of least extent the next spreads more and the third most of all A larger interruption succeeds and the last in comparison of the others seems but a gentle effort The whole vast rampart is beautifully shaded with wood which in some places grows among the cliffs garnishing the rocks in others it grows wildly among those breaks and interruptions which separate their several faces The  summit  of the whole semicircular range is finely adorned with scattered trees which often break the hard lines of the rock and by admitting the light give an airiness to the whole  The river Derwent which winds under this semicircular screen is a broken rapid stream In some places only it is visible in others delving among rocks and woody projections it is an object only to the ear  It is impossible to view such scenes as these without feeling the imagination take fire Little fairy scenes where the parts tho trifling are happily disposed such for instance as the cascadescene  See page Vol I  in the gardens at the Leasowes please the fancy But this is scenery of a dif∣ferent kind Every object here is sublime and wonderful Not only the eye is pleased but the imagination is filled We are carried at once into the fields of fiction and romance Enthusiastic ideas take possession of us and we suppose ourselves among the inhabitants of fa∣bled timesThe transition indeed is easy and natural from romantic scenes to romantic inhabitants  Sylvis scena coruscis  Desuper horrentique atrum nemus imminet umbra  Nympharum domus  The woods here are subject to one great inconveniencethat of periodical lopping About seven years ago I had the mortification to see almost the whole of this scenery display∣ing one continued bald face of rock It is now  In the year  I should suppose in perfection More wood would cover and less would dismantle it  The  exit  of this bold romantic scene which from the south is the  entrance  into it like the exit from Hopedale is equal to the scene itself Grand rocks arise on each side and dismiss you through a winding barrier which lengthens out the impression of the scene like the vibration of a sound In some parts the solid stone is cut through  Admittitque viam sectae per viscera rupis  From hence to Ashburn the road is pleasant after the first steeps The ground is varied and adorned with wood and we lose all those wild scenes which we met with in the Peak When nature throws her  wild scenes  into beautiful composition and decorates them with great and noble objects they are of all scenes the most engaging But as there is little of this decoration in the  wild scenes of the Peak  we left them without regret  SECT XXIX  FROM Ashburn which is among the larger villages and stands sweetly we made an excursion to  Dovedale  Dovedale is the continuation of another similar dale which is sometimes called  Bun∣sterdale  tho I believe both parts of the valley are known except just on the spot by the general name of Dovedale  Bunsterdale opens with a grand craggy mountain on the right As you look up to the cliffs which form the irregular sides of this precipice your guide will not fail to tell you the melancholy fate of a late digni∣tary of the church who riding along the top of it with a young lady a Miss Laroche behind him and pursuing a track which  happened to be only a sheeppath and led to a declivity fell in attempting to turn his horse out of it He was killed but the young lady was caught by a bush and saved A dreadful story is an admirable introduc∣tion to an awful scene It rouses the mind and adds double terror to every impending rock  The bare sides of these lofty craggs on the right are contrasted by a woody mountain on the left In the midst of the wood a sort of rockywall rises perpendicular from the soil These detached rocks are what chiefly characterize the sceneA little be∣yond them we enter what is properly called Dovedale  From the description given of Dovedale even by men of taste we had conceived it to be a scene rather of curiosity than of beauty We supposed the rocks were formed into the most fantastic shapes and expected to see a gigantic display of all the conic sections But we were agreeably deceived The whole composition is chaste and picturesquely beau∣tiful in a high degree  On the right you have a continuation of the same grand craggy mountain which ran along Bunsterdale only the mountain in Dovedale is higher and the rocks still more majestic and more detached  On the lest is a continuation also of the same hanging woods which began in Bun∣sterdale In the midst of this woody sce∣nery arises a grand solitary pointed rock the characteristic feature of the whole scene which by way of eminence is known by the name of Dovedalechurch It consists of a large face of rock with two or three little spiry heads and one very large one and tho the form is rather peculiar yet is it pleasing It's rising a single object among surrounding woods takes away the fantastic idea and gives it sublimity It is the multiplicity of these spiry heads which makes them dis∣gusting as when we see several of them adorning the summits of alpine mountains  See page Vol I  But a  solitary  rock tho spiry has often a good effect A picturesque ornament of this kind marks a beautiful scene at a place  called the  NewWeir  on the banks of the Wye  See observations on the Wye page    The colour of all these rocks is  grey  and harmonizes agreeably with the verdure which runs in large patches down their channelled sides Among all the picturesque accompa∣niments of rocks there is nothing which has a finer effect in painting than this variation and contrast of colour between the cold grey hue of a rocky surface and the rich tints of herbage  The valley of Dovedale is very narrow at the bottom consisting of little more than the channel of the Dove which is a consi∣derable stream and of a footpath along it's banks When the river rises it swells over the whole area of the valley and has a fine effect The grandeur of the river is then in full harmony with the grandeur of it's banks  Dovedale is a calm sequestered scene and yet not wholly the haunt of solitude and con∣templation It is too magnificent and too interesting a piece of scenery to leave the mind wholly disengaged  The late Dr Brown comparing the sce∣nery here with that of Keswick  In a letter to lord Lyttelton already quoted  tells us that  of the three circumstances beauty horror and immensity  by which last he means  gran∣deur of which Keswick consists the second alone is found in Dovedale  In this description he seems in my opinion just to have inverted the truth It is difficult to conceive why he should either rob this scene of  beauty  and  grandeur  or fill it with  horror  If  beauty  consist in a pleasing arrange∣ment of pleasing parts Dovedale has cer∣tainly a great share of  beauty  If  grandeur  consist in large parts and large objects it has certainly  grandeur  also But if  horror  consist in the vastness of those parts it cer∣tainly predominates less here than in the re∣gions of Keswick The hills the woods and the rocks of Dovedale are sufficient to raise the idea of  grandeur  but not to impress that of  horror  On the whole Dovedale is perhaps one of the most pleasing pieces of scenery of the kind we any where meet with It has some∣thing in it peculiarly characteristic It's de∣tached perpendicular rocks stamp it with an image intirely it's own and for that rea∣son it affords the greater pleasure For it is in scenery as in life we are most struck with the peculiarity of an original character provided there is nothing offensive in it  From Dovedale we proceeded to Ilam which is also a very characteristic scene  Ilam stands on a hill which slopes gently in front but is abrupt and broken behind where it is garnished with rock and hanging wood Round this hill sweeps a semicir∣cular valley the area of which is a flat mea∣dow  nearly a quarter of a mile in breadth and twice as much in circumference At the extremity of the meadow winds the channel of a river considerable in it's dimensions tho penuriously supplied with water and be∣yond all sweeps a grand woody bank which forms a barrier to all the scenery behind the house and yet in the front admits a view of distant mountains particularly of that squarecapt hill called Thorpcloud which stands near the entrance of Dovedale  Besides the  beauty  of the scene we are presented with a great  curiosity  The river  Manifold  formerly ran in that channel under the woody bank which we observed to be now so penuriously suppliedIt has deserted it's ancient bed and about seven miles from Ilam enters gradually the body of a moun∣tain under which it forces a way and con∣tinues it's subterraneous rout as far as the hill on which Ilam stands There it rises from the ground and forms a river in a burst The channel under the bank is a sort of wastepipe to it carrying off the superfluity of water which in heavy rains cannot enter the mountain  Curious this river certainly is but were it mine I should wish much to check it's subterraneous progress and throw it into it's old channel The o  zy bed which is now a deformity would then be an object of beauty circling the meadow with a noble streamAnother deformity also would be avoided that of cutting the meadow with two channelsOr perhaps all ends might be answered if the wastestream could be diverted Then both the curiosity and in a good degree the beauty would remain  On the whole we have few situations so pleasingly romantic as Ilam The rocky hill it stands on the ample lawn which incir∣cles it the bold woody bank which in∣virons the whole where pleasing walks might be formed the bold incursion of the river the views into the country and the neigh∣bourhood of Dovedale which lies within the distance of a summerevening walk bring together such a variety of uncommon and beautiful circumstances as are rarely to be found in one place  Very little had been done at Ilam when we saw it to improve it's natural situation tho it is capable of great improvement par∣ticularly in the front of the house There the ground which is now a formal flowergarden might easily be united with the other parts of the scenery in it's neighbourhood It is now totally at variance with it  In the higher part of the garden under a rock is a seat dedicated to the memory of Congreve where you are told by your con∣ductor he composed several of his plays  From Ilam we went to Oakover to see the  holy family  by Raphael As this picture is very celebrated we gave it a minute examina∣tion  Whether it be an original I am not critic enough in the works of Raphael to deter∣mine I should suppose it is and it were a pity to rob it of it's greatest merit No∣thing I think but the character of the master could give it the reputation it holds If it be examined by the rules of painting  it is certainly deficient The manner is hard without freedom and the colouring black without sweetness Neither is there any har∣mony in the whole What harmony can arise from a conjunction of red blue and yellow of which the draperies are composed almost in raw tints Nor is the deficiency in the colouring compensated by any har∣mony in the light and shade  But these things perhaps we are not led to expect in the works of Raphael In them we seek for grace drawing character and ex∣pression Here however they are not found  Since I made these remarks I was glad to see a kind of sanction given them by a great authority Sir Joshua Reynolds in one of his lectures before the academy speaks very slightly of the  easelpictures  of Raphael which he says give us no idea of that great master's genius  The virgin we allow to be a sweet and lovely figure but Joseph is inanimate the boys are grinning satyrins and with regard to drawing the right arm of Christ I should suppose is very faulty  Since I made these remarks I was glad to see a kind of sanction given them by a great authority Sir Joshua Reynolds in one of his lectures before the academy speaks very slightly of the  easelpictures  of Raphael which he says give us no idea of that great master's genius    On the whole a holy family is a subject but indifferently adapted to the pencil Un∣less  the painter could give the mother that  celestial love  and the child that  divine com∣posure and sweetness  which I take it for granted no painter can give the subject immediately degenerates into  a mother and a child  The  actions  of our Saviour's life may be good subjects for a picture for altho the divine energy of the principal figure cannot be expressed yet the other parts of the story being well told may supply that deficiency But in a holy family there is  no action  no story toldthe whole consists in the expres∣sion of characters and affections which we must suppose beyond conception So that if these are not expressed the whole is nothing  In the same room hang three or four pic∣tures any of which I should value more than the celebrated  Raphael  There is a small picture by Rubens representing the angels appearing to the women in the garden which pleased me The angels indeed are clumsey figures and dressed like choiristers but every other part of the picture and the management of the whole is good  In a large picture also of the unjust steward the family in distress is well described but on the whole it is one of those ambiguous pictures on which we cannot well pronounce  at sight  One half of it seems painted by  Rubens  of the other half we doubted  There are also in the same room two very capital  Vanderveldts  a calm and a storm Both are good but the former pleased me better than almost any picture by that master I have any where seen  SECT XXX  FROM Ashburn to which we returned from Oakover we went the next day through a chearful woody country to Ked∣dleston the seat of lord Scarsdale  The situation of Keddleston participates little of the romantic country on which it borders The house stands in a pleasant park rather bare of wood but the deficiency is in a great degree compensated by the beauty of the trees some of which are large and noble A stream by the help of art is changed into a river over which the road conducts you obliquely to the house forming a good ap∣proach  The architecture of Keddleston as far as I could judge is a composition of elegance and grandeur The main body of the house which you enter by a noble portico is joined by a corridore on each side to a handsome  wing In the back front the saloon which is a rotunda appears to advantage From the hall lead the state rooms which are not many The rest of the house consists of excellent offices and comfortable apartments and the plan of the whole is easy and intelligible  The hall is perhaps one of the grandest and most beautiful private rooms in England The roof is supported by very noble columns some of which are intire blocks of marble dug as we were informed from lord Scars∣dale's own quarries It is rather indeed a spurious sort of marble but more beautiful at least in colour than any that is imported There is a richness and a variety in it that pleases the eye exceedingly the veins are large and suited to columns and a rough polish  by receiving the light in one body  gives a noble swell to the column and adds much to it's beauty  When I saw this grand room I thought it wanted no farther decoration All was simple great and uniform as it ought to be Since that time I have heard the doors and windows have been painted and varnished in the cabinet style I have not seen these alterations and cannot pronounce on their merit but I am  at a loss to conceive that any further embel∣lishment could add to the effect  The  entrance  of a great house should in my opinion consist only of that kind of beauty which arises merely from simplicity and gran∣deur These ideas as you proceed in the apart∣ments may detail themselves into ornaments of various kinds and in their proper places even into prettinesses Alien misplaced am∣bitious ornaments no doubt are  every where  disgusting but in the  grand entrance  of a house they should  particularly  be avoided A false taste discovered there is apt to pursue you through the apartments and throw it's colours on what may happen to be goodI should be unwilling however to suppose that any improper decorations are added to the hall at Keddleston as the ornaments of the house in general when I saw it seemed to be under the conduct of a chast and elegant taste Tho every thing was rich I do not recollect that any thing was tawdry trifling or affected  The pictures of which there is a consider∣able collection are chiefly what may be called good  furniture pictures  See page Vol I  A Rembrandt is  the first in rank and is indeed a valuable piece It represents  Daniel interpreting Bel∣teshazzar's dream  There is great amusement in this picture It is highly finished and the heads are particularly excellent For the rest it is a scattered piece without any idea of composition  In the drawingroom are two large uprights by Benedetto Lutti one representing the last supper the other the death of Abel They are painted in a singular manner with strong lights The former has a good effect The death of Abel is likewise a shewy picture but has nothing very striking in it except the figure of Cain  In the dead game by Snyders there is a good fawn but the picture is made disagree∣able by the  glaring  tail of a peacock  In the dead game and dogs by Fyt there are good  passages  but no  whole  The  woman of Samaria  and  St John in the wilderness  by B Stiozzi are good pictures  There is also a large Coyp wellpainted but badly composed  At Derby which lies within three miles of Keddleston we were immediately struck with the tower of the great church which is a very beautiful piece of Gothic architecture  The object of the chinaworks there is merely ornament which is particularly unhappy as they were at the time we saw them under no regulation of taste A very free hand we found employed in painting the vases and the first colours were  laid in  with spirit but in the  finishing  they were so richly daubed that all freedom was lost in fineryIt may now be otherwise  The gaudy painters however of such works have the example of a great master before them even Raphael himself whose paintings in the pottery way tho highly esteemed in the cabi∣nets of the curious seem generally to be daubed in a manner fit only  ad captandum vulgus  It is said that Raphael fell in love with a potter's daughter and that to please her he painted  her father's dishes It is probable therefore that he suited them to her taste which ac∣counts for the gaudy colouring they display How much more simple elegant and beautiful is the painting of the old Etruscan vases many of which Mr Wedgewood has so happily imi∣tated There we see how much better an effect is produced by chast colours on a dark ground than by gaudy colours on a light one  A person curious in machinery would be much amused by the silkmill at Derby in which thirty thousand little wheels are put in motion by one great wheel The various parts tho so complicated in appearance are yet so distinct in their movements that I was told any one workman has the power of stopping that part of the machinery which is under his direction without interrupting the motion of the rest  The country between Derby and Leicester is flat Quardonwood a little beyond Lough∣borough rising on the right makes an agree∣able variety amidst such a continuation of  uniformity Mount Sorrel also has the same effect  The approach to Leicester gives it more con∣sequence than it really has The town itself old and incumbered has little beauty but it abounds with fragments of antiquity  Behind St Nicholas's church is a piece of Roman architecture one of the only  pure  pieces perhaps in England We see many towers which go by the name of Caesar and boast of Roman origin I doubt whether any of them can boast it with truth And what few  remnants  we have it is thought have all been retouched in after times This fragment seems to have suffered no alteration It's insignificance has secured it Little more is left than a wall with four double arches on it's face retiring but not perforated And yet in this trifling remnant there is a simplicity and dignity which are very pleasing It is possible however that prejudice may in part be the source of it's beauty Through an asso∣ciation  of ideas we may here be pleased with what we have admired in Italian views  This wall is built of brick tho it has pro∣bably been faced with better materials For what purpose it was constructed does not appear nor whether it was intended for the end or side of a building The idea of the country is that it has been a temple from the great number of bones of animals which have been found near it from whence it takes the name of  Holybones  The church of St Nicholas which stands opposite to it seems to have been built out of it's ruins from the many Roman bricks with which it abounds Indeed the style of building in the body of the church is not unlike it  At Leicester also we were put on the pursuit of another Roman fragmenta curious piece of sculpture which we found at last in a cel∣lar It is a scrap of tessulated pavement on which three figures are represented a stag a woman leaning over it and a boy shooting  with a bow It may be a piece of Roman antiquity but it is a piece of miserable work∣manship  In this ancient town are found also many vestiges of British antiquityFrom so rich an endowment as the abbey of Leicester for∣merly possessed we expected many beautiful remains as it is still in a kind of sequestered state but in that expectation we were disap∣pointed Not the least fragment of a Gothic window is left not the merest mutilation of an arch It's present remains afford as little beauty as the ruins of a common dwelling And in all probability the present ruin is no∣thing better than a common dwelling built from the materials of the ancient abbey Such at least is the tradition of the place It be∣longed formerly we were told to the family of Hastings and was lost at play to the earl of Devonshire but before the conveyance was prepared the owner in the spirit of revenge and mortification sent private orders to have it burntMany a black tale might be un∣folded in most old houses if walls could speak  But the great story of this abbey has a vir∣tuous tendency Within it's walls was once exhibited a scene more humiliating to human ambition and more instructive to human grandeur than almost any which history hath produced Here the fallen pride of Woolsey retreated from the insults of the world All his visions of ambition were now gone his pomp and pageantry and crouded levees On this spot he told the listening monks the sole attendants of his dying hour as they stood around his pallet that he was come to lay his bones among them and gave that pathetic testimony to the truth and joys of religion which preaches beyond a thousand lectures "If I had served God as faithfully as I served the king he would not thus have forsaken my old age"  The death of Woolsey would make a fine moral picture if the hand of any master could give the pallid features of the dying statesman that chagrin that remorse those pangs of  anguish which in these last bitter moments of his life possessed him  The point might be taken when the monks are administring the comforts of religion which the despairing prelate cannot feel The subject requires a gloomy apartment which a ray through a Gothic window might just en∣lighten throwing it's force chiefly on the principal figure and dying away on the rest The appendages of the piece need only be few and simple little more than the crozier and red hat to mark the cardinal and tell the story  This is not the only piece of English history which is illustrated in this ancient town Here the house is still shewn where Richard III passed the night before the battle of Bos∣worth and there is a story of him still preserved in the  corporationrecords  as we were informed by our conductor who did not however appear to be a man of deep eru∣dition which illustrates the caution and dark∣ness of that prince's characterIt was his custom to carry among the baggage of his camp a cumbersome wooden bed which he  pretended was the only bed he could sleep in Here he contrived a secret receptacle for his treasure which lay concealed under a weight of timber After the fatal day on which Richard fell the earl of Richmond entered Leicester with his victorious troops The friends of Richard were pillaged but the bed was neglected by every plunderer as useless lumberThe owner of the house afterwards discovering the hoard became suddenly rich without any visible cause He bought lands and at length as our intelligencer informed us arrived at the dignity of being mayor of Leicester Many years afterwards his widow who had been left in great affluence was murdered for her wealth by a servant maid who had been privy to the affair and at the trial of this woman and her accomplices the whole transaction came to light  SECT XXXI  FROM Leicester the country still conti∣nues flat and woody stretching out into meadows pastures and common fields The horizon on every side is generally terminated by spires Oftener than once we were able to count six or seven adorning the limits of one circular view  Of all the countries in England this is the place for that noble species of diversion to which the inventive genius of our young sports∣men hath given the name of  steeplehunting  In a dearth of game the chassieurs draw up in a body and pointing to some conspicuous steeple set off in full speed towards it over hedge and ditch He who is so happy as to arrive first receives equal honour it is said  as if he had come in foremost at the death of the fox  In these plains as rich as they are unpic∣turesque we had nothing to observe but the numerous herds of cattle and flocks of sheep which graze them and in the deficiency of other objects we amused ourselves with the various forms of these animals and their most agreeable combinations  The horse in itself is certainly a nobler animal than the cow His form is more elegant and his spirit gives fire and grace to his actions But in a  picturesque light  the cow has undoubtedly the advantage and is every way better suited to receive the graces of the pencil  In the first place the lines of the horse are round and smooth and admit little va∣riety whereas the bones of the cow are high and vary the line here and there by a square∣ness which is very picturesque There is a greater proportion also of concavity in them the lines of the horse being chiefly convex  But is not the lean wornout horse whose bones are staring as picturesque as the cow In a degree it is but we do not with plea∣sure admit the idea of beauty into any deficient form Prejudice even in spite of us rather revolts against such an admission however picturesque  Nor are the lines only of the cow more picturesque it has the advantage also in the filling up of those lines If the horse be sleek especially and have what the jockies call a  fine coat  the smoothness of the sur∣face is not so well adapted to receive the spirited touches of the pencil as the rougher form and coat of the cow The very action of licking herself which is so common among cows throws the hair when it is long into different feathery flakes and gives it those strong touches which are indeed the very touches of the pencilCows are commonly the most picturesque in the months of April and May when the old hair is coming off There is a contrast between the rougher and  smoother parts of the coat and often also a pleasing variety of greyish tints blended with others of a richer hue We observe this too in colts when we see them in a state of nature  But the cow is not only better adapted to receive the spirited touches of the pencil it is better adapted also to receive the beauties of light The horse like a piece of smooth gardenground receives it in a gradual spread the cow like the abruptness of a rugged country receives it in bold catches And tho in  large objects  a  gradation  of light is one of the great sources of beauty yet in a  small object  it has not commonly so pleasing an effect as arises from  smart catching lights  The  colour  of the cow also is often more picturesque That of the horse is generally uniform Whereas the tints of the cow fre∣quently play into each other a dark head melting into lighter sides and these again being still darker than the hinder parts Those are always the most beautiful which are thus  tinted with dark colours harmoniously steal∣ing into lighter Here and there a few small white spots may add a beauty but if they run into large blotches and make a harsh termi∣nation between the dark and light colour they are disagreeable The full black also and full red have little variety in  themselves  tho in a  group  all this unpleasant colouring may harmonize  In the  character  and  general form  of cows as well as of horses there are many degrees of beauty and deformity  The  character  of the cow is marked chiefly in the head An open or contracted fore∣head a long or a short visage the twist of a horn or the colour of an eyebrow will totally alter the  character  and give a sour or an agreeable air to the countenance Nor is the head of this animal more characteristic than it is adapted to receive all the graces of the pencil  With regard to the  general form  of the cow we are not indeed so exact as in that of the horse The points and proportions of the horse are studied and determined with  so much exactness that a small deviation strikes the eye In the form of the cow we are not so learned If  deformity  be avoided it is enough There are two faults particu∣larly in the line of a cow a  hogback  and a  sinking rump  which are it's most usual ble∣mishes If it be free from these and have an harmonious colouring and a pleasant cha∣racter it cannot well be disagreeable  The  bull  and the  cow  differ more in  character  and  form  than the horse and the mare They are cast in  different moulds  The sourness of the head the thickness and convexity of the neck the heaviness of the chest and shoul∣ders the smoothness of the hipbones and the lightness of the hindquarters are always found in the bull and rarely in the cow  The sheep is as beautiful an animal as the cow and as well adapted to receive the graces of painting Tho it want the variety of co∣louring yet there is a softness in it's fleece a richness a delicacy of touch and a sweet  tenderness of shadow which make it a very pleasing object  The sheep is beautiful in every state except just when it has past under the sheers But it soon recovers it's beauty and in a few weeks loses it's furrowed sides and appears again in a picturesque dress It's beauty continues as the wool increases What it loses in shape it gains in the feathered flaki∣ness of it's fleece Nor is it the least beau∣tiful when it's sides are a little ragged when part of it's shape is discovered and part hid beneath the wool Berghem de∣lights to represent it in this ragged form  In the  characters  and  forms  of sheep we observe little difference We sometimes see an unpleasing visage and sometimes the dis∣agreeable rounding line which we have just called the hogback but in an animal so small the eye is less apt to investigate  parts  it rather rests on the  whole appearance  and the more so as sheep being particularly gre∣garious are generally considered as objects in a group  The observations I have made with regard to the beauty of these animals are confirmed by the practice of all the great masters in ani∣mal life Berghem Coyp Potter and others who always preferred them to horses and deer in adorning their rural scenesIt is an ad∣ditional pleasure therefore that such animals as are the most useful are likewise the most ornamental  Having thus examined the  forms  of these picturesque animals we spent some time also in examining their most agreeable  combina∣tions  Cattle are so large that when they orna∣ment a foreground a few are sufficient Two will hardly combine Three make a good groupeither unitedor when one is a little removed from the other two If you increase the group beyond three one or more in proportion must necessarily be a  little detached  This detachment prevents hea∣viness and adds variety It is the same prin∣ciple  applied to cattle which we before ap∣plied to mountains and other objects  See page Vol II c    The same rules in grouping may be applied to  distant cattle  only here you may introduce a greater number  In grouping contrasted attitudes should be studied Recumbency should be opposed to a standing posture foreshortened figures to lengthened and one colour to another White blotches may inliven a group tho in a single animal we observed they are offen∣sive  Sheep come under the same rules only the  foreground  as well as the  distance  ad∣mits a larger number of these smaller ani∣mals In pastoral subjects sheep are often ornamental when  dotted about  the sides of  distant  hills Here little more is necessary than to guard against regular shapeslines circles and crosses which large flocks of sheep sometimes form In combining them however or rather scattering them the  painter may keep in view the principle we have already so often inculcated They may be huddled together in one or more large bodies from which little groups of different sizes in proportion to the larger should be detached  In favour of the doctrine I have here ad∣vanced of the  subordinate group  I cannot forbear adding the authority of a great master whose thorough acquaintance with every part of painting hath often in the course of this work been observed  Aeneas on his landing upon the coast of Africa sees from the higher ground a herd of deer feeding in a valley and Virgil who in the slightest instance seems ever to have had before his eyes ideas of picturesque beauty introduces the herd just as a painter would have done From the  larger group  he de∣taches a  subordinate one    Tres  litore cervos  Prospicit errantes hos  tota armenta  sequuntur  A tergo  I need not conceal that some commentators have found in these three stags which the  followed the poet's inclination to aristo∣cracy and that others have supposed he meant a compliment to the triumvirate It is the commentator's business to find out a recondite meaning common sense is satisfied with what is most obvious  It may be observed further that  cattle  and  sheep  mix very agreeably  together  as also  young  animals and  old  Lambs and calves fill up little interstices in a group and assist the com∣binationI may add that  human figures  also combine very agreeably with  animals  Indeed they generally give a grace to a group as they draw it to an  apex  I scarce need to apologize for this long digression as it is so naturally suggested by the country through which we passed and so closely connected with the subject which we treat He who studies landscape will find himself very deficient if he hath not paid great attention to the choice and com∣bination both of animal and human figures  SECT XXXII  LEAVING the plains of Leicestershire we entered the county of Northampton which assumes a new face The ground begins to rise and fall and distances to open  Lord Strafford's gardens extending a con∣siderable way on the left are a great ornament to the country  Lord Hallifax's improvements succeed They make little appearance from the road but the road itself is so beautiful that it requires no aid It passes through spacious lanes adorned on each side by a broad irregular border of grass and winds through hedgerows of fullgrown oak which the several turns of the  road form into clumps You have both a good foreground and beautiful views into a fine country through the boles of the trees The undressed simplicity and native beauty of such lanes as these exceed the walks of the most finished garden  From NewportPagnel the country still continues pleasant Before we reach Wooburn we have a good view of Wooburnabbey and of the surrounding woods which deco∣rate the landscape  Wooburnpark is an extensive woody scene and capable of much improvement We rode through it but could not see the duke of Bedford's house which is shewn only on particular daysBut the disappointment was not great The  furniture  of all fine houses is much the same and as for pictures such is the prevalence of  names  and fashion that sometimes what are called the best collections scarce repay the ceremonies you are obliged to go through in getting a sight of them  After we leave Wooburn the views con∣tinue still pleasant till we meet the chalky hills of Dunstable These would disfigure the loveliest scene But when we have passed these glaring heights the country revives the rising grounds are covered with wood and verdure and the whole looks pleasing About Redburn particularly the country is beautiful and is thrown into distance by large oaks which overhang the road  St Albans' church and the ruins about it make an immense pile of which some parts are picturesque There is a mixture too of brick and stone in the building which often makes a pleasing contrast in the tints Tho there are many remains of beautiful Gothic in this church there are more deformities of Saxon architecture particularly the tower which is heavy and disagreeably ornamented The little spire which arises from it is very absurdWithin the church is a monument near the altar of very curious Gothic work∣manship  Among the numerous inhabitants of the subterraneous regions of this church lies that celebrated prince remembered by the name of good duke Humphrey the youngest bro∣ther of Henry V He was put to death by a faction in the succeeding reign and was buried somewhere in this abbey but his grave was unknown Having lain concealed near three centuries he came again to light not many years ago By an accident a large vault was discovered in which he was found sole tenant wrapped in lead and immersed in a pickle which had preserved him in tole∣rable order  Leaving St Alban's we past the ruins of Verulam which was raised in Roman times and destroyed in Saxon As it was never restored very little now remains of that ancient town In one part about a quarter of a mile from the road a fragment has the appearance of an old castle but the vestiges of the wall run at least a mile  Beyond Verulam the country grows pleasant Soon after you pass Barnet the road enters Finchleycommon The distance is woody intersected by an extensive plain which is connected with it by a sprinkling of scattered trees The parts are large and the scenery not unpicturesque  The first view of Highgatehill would make a good distance if it were properly supported by a foreground The view  from  it is very grand but is distracted by a multiplicity of objects  After this the country is gone London comes on apace and all those disgusting ideas with which it's great avenues aboundbrickkilns steaming with offensive smokesewers and ditches sweating with filthheaps of col∣lected soil and stinks of every denomination clouds of dust rising and vanishing from agi∣tated wheels pursuing each other in rapid mo∣tionor taking stationary possession of the  road by becoming the atmosphere of some cumbersome slowmoving waggonvillages without rural ideastrees and hedgerows without a tinge of greenand fields and mea∣dows without pasturage in which lowing bullocks are crouded together waiting for the shambles or cows penned like hogs to feed on grainsIt was an agreeable relief to get through this succession of noisome objects which did violence to all the senses by turns and to leave behind us  the busy hum of men  stealing from it through the quiet lanes of Surry which leading to no great mart or general rendezvous afford calmer retreats on every side than can easily be found in the neighbourhood of so great a town  July  THE END  EXPLANATION OF THE PRINTS  VOLUME I  PAGE THIS view of Warwickcastle is inserted chiefly as an illustration of what hath been advanced in the preface see page xxv that a  faithful portrait is rarely in every part beautiful  Nothing can be more disagreeable to the eye than the cap represented here upon the round tower and the squareness and for∣mality of the remoter parts of the building tho in other situations Warwickcastle affords many pleasing views some of which with a little  alteration on the foregrounds see preface page xxvii would be very picturesque  PAGE A specimen of the elegant mode in which handles are adapted to Tuscan vases and the awkward manner in which they are commonly affixed to those of modern construction  PAGE An explanation of the shapes and lines of mountains They are left unshadowed that their forms may be more conspicuous  PAGE An illustration of the appearance which the shores of a lake form when seen  from its sur∣face in a boat  The promontories and bays unless very large lose all their indentations and the whole boundary of the lake becomes a mere thread When you stand  upon the shore  if your situ∣ation be in any degree elevated the promon∣tories appear to come forward and all the indentations are distinct These two modes of viewing may be compared by turning from this print to page vol II  in which is represented a lake seen  from the shore  This latter mode of viewing a lake is generally the most pleasing unless indeed the stand be taken too high which elevates the horizon too much  PAGE This print is meant to exemplify those beau∣tiful reflections which are sometimes formed on the surface of a lake and broken by it's tremulous motion as explained in page  PAGE The  contracted valley  may be considered as a species of foreground The valley here repre∣sented opens rather too abruptly There is more beauty in this kind of landscape when the  removed screen  folds more behind the  front one  and the distance appears over the inter∣secting point These scenes are generally deco∣rated with a river but sometimes only with a road Of this latter kind is Middletondale described in the th page of the IId vol The  contracted valley  is contrasted by the open  extended vale  a scene of which kind is represented in the st page of the IId vol  PAGE An illustration of the  effect of light  which is so great as to give consequence even where there are no objects A setting sun or a storm as here represented are most favourable to an exhibition of this kind  PAGE This plan of Windermere is not geographi∣cally exact but enough so to give the reader an idea of it's shape and the situation of the several places mentioned on it's shores  PAGE This view of the middle part of Windermere is taken from the grounds a little to the north of Bowness The distance as the reader will observe from the plan is composed of that country which shoots away towards the south The high grounds make a part of Furnessfell which is described in page stretching along the western shores of the lake towards the northBelow Furnessfell appear some of the islands of the lake particularly the great island which is the most southern of them  PAGE This is a view of that part of Furnessabbey which is called the  school  and which is one of the most beautiful fragments of that elegant ruin  PAGE An illustration of that kind of wild country of which we saw several instances as we en∣tered Cumberland In general the mountains make the most considerable part of these scenes But when any of them is furnished with a distant view of a lake the landscape is greatly inriched  PAGE This plan of Keswicklake means only to express the general shape of it and the relative situation of it's several parts  PAGE The character of that sort of rocky scenery is here given which is not uncommonly found on the banks of lakes particularly of Keswick lake the shores of which exhibit several in∣stances of these detached rocks  PAGE An illustration of that sort of country which composes the narrower parts of the straits of Borrodale They consist of rocky or craggy mountains on each side with a stream or in some parts where the stream may be hid a road in the middle But it is difficult to give any idea of these tremendous scenes in so small a compass as they are here exhibited for as their terror consists greatly in their immensity it is not easy to persuade the eye to conceive highly of their grandeur from these diminutive representationsMr Farrington has given us on a larger scale a fine portrait and I think a very exact one of the entrance into these straits at the village of Grange  PAGE This print was intended to give some idea of that kind of rocky scenery of which Gates∣garthdale is composed and of that solemnity which it assumed when we saw the sweeping clouds pass over it's summits but I am sorry to say it does not express the idea so well as I could wish The proofs of this print escaped me too soon Indeed I thought it had been  brought nearer my idea than I find it is The clouds are ill madeout the distant rocks are worse and the figures as a scale to the perspective are twice as large as they ought to beWith these hints however I hope the imagination of the spectator may not be misled by the deficiences of the print  VOLUME II  PAGE AN illustration of that beautiful species of landscape produced by an  extensive vale  Gradation is among the first principles of pic∣turesque beauty A graduating light a gradu∣ating shade or a graduating distance are all beautiful When the vale therefore does not exceed such a proportion as is adapted to the eye it is pleasing to see it fading away gradu∣ally from the foreground into the obscurity of distance It presents indeed only  one uniform  idea which tho often  grand  is not generally so  pleasing  as the variety and intricacy of a country broken into parts and yet harmoni∣ously combined  PAGE This plan of Ulleswater like the others is not very exact but enough so to give an idea of it's general shape and the relative situation of the several places on it's shores  PAGE This print illustrates that kind of scenery which is presented by Ulleswater It is by no means a portrait but it gives some idea of the view towards Patterdale in which the rocky promontory on the left and the two woody promontories on the right are conspi∣cuous features  PAGE This view has more the air of Dacrecastle than of any of the other old castles we met with but it is chiefly introduced to shew the beautiful effect which some of these ruins had when seen under a gloomy hemisphere in∣lightened by the rays of a setting sun  PAGE A view of Scalebycastle in which the old tower part of the walls and the bastion are represented  PAGE An illustration of the force of contrast in a piece of regular ground bisected  PAGE This print is meant to give some idea of that kind of continuation of rocky scenery which is found at Matlock along the banks of the Derwent but it is not so good an illus∣tration as might be wished  PAGE This view of  Dovedale  represents that beau∣tiful scene in a more naked state than it is described The stratum of it only is here represented which the spectator's imagination must cloath with wood to give it compleat beautyThe fact is a little gain unluckily arises from dismantling it periodically of it's wood and this drawing was made just after the axe had been at work  PAGE An illustration of that kind of  flat country  which we meet with in Leicestershire The horizon is generally bounded by a distance  and yet seldom an extensive one as there is rarely a rising ground that can command it The country is uninteresting and wants ad∣ventitious objects to set it off If the distance happen to be spread with light under a dark cloud it is a happy circumstance and has a good effect Sometimes on the middle grounds a gentle rise adorned with a spire or a shep∣herd attending his flock may relieve the eye Such circumstances are all we can expect In defect of these we must wait till we can find a few cattle on the foreground which may turn the  landscape  into an  appendage  and give us one of the pictures of Coyp  PAGE This print exhibits a comparison between the lines of the horse and the cow as objects of picturesque beauty  PAGE And this exhibits the same mode of com∣parison between the bull and the cow  PAGE These two prints are meant to explain the doctrine of grouping  larger cattle Two  will  hardly combine There is indeed no way of forming  two  into a group but by  uniting  them as they are represented in the former of these prints If they stand apart what∣ever their attitudes or situation may be there will be a deficiency But with  three  you are almost sure of a good group except indeed they all stand in the same attitude and at equal distances They generally however combine the most beau∣tifully when two are  united  and the third a little  removed  Four  introduce a new difficulty in grouping  Separate  they would have a bad effect Two and two together would be equally bad The only way in which they will group well is to  unite three  as represented in the second of these prints and to  remove the fourth  PAGE These two prints illustrate the doctrine of grouping  smaller animals  as sheep goats and deer When they occupy the  foreground  as represented in the first they come under the same rule of grouping as larger cattle only a greater number may be introduced  And if the main body be larger the subordi∣nate group must be so of course If they be removed to a  middle distance  as represented in the other of these prints the subordinate group is of less consequence and still of less the farther it recedes from the eye The whole is only considered as one body blended as it were and shadowed or inlight∣ened with the ground and it is enough if regular and disagreeable shapes are avoided  ERRATA c  VOL I  Page for  where the admirers  read  that the
