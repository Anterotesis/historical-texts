 THE HISTORY OF  TOM JONES  A FOUNDLING  In THREE VOLUMES  VOL I  By HENRY FIELDING  Esq  Mores hominum multorum vidit  DUBLIN  Printed for JOHN SMITH at the  PhilosophersHeads  on the  BlindQuay  M DCC XLIX  To the HONOURABLE George Lyttleton  Esq  One of the Lords Commissioners of the TREASURY  SIR  NOTWITHSTANDING your constant Refusal when I have asked Leave to prefix your Name to this Dedication I muststill insist on my Right to desire your Protection of this Work  To you Sir it is owing that this History was ever began It was by your Desire that I first thought of such a Composition So many Years have since past that you may have perhaps forgotten this Circumstance But your Desires are to me in the Nature of Commands and the Impression of them is never to be erased from my Memory  Again Sir without your Assistance this History had never been completed Be not  startled at the Assertion I do not intend to draw on you the Suspicion of being a Romance Writer I mean no more than that I partly owe to you my Existance during great Part of the Time which I have employed in composing it another Matter which it may be necessary to remind you of since there are certain Actions of which you are apt to be extremely forgetful but of these I hope I shall always have a better Memory than yourself  Lastly it is owing to you that the History appears what it now is If there be in this Work as some have been pleased to say a stronger Picture of a truly benevolent Mind than is to be found in any other who that knows you and a particular Acquaintance of yours will doubt whence that Benevolence hath been copied The World will not I believe make me the Compliment of thinking I took it from myself I care not This they shall own that the two Persons from whom I have taken it that is to say two of the best and worthiest Men in the World are strongly and zealously my Friends I might be contented with this and yet my Vanity will add a third to the Number and him one of the greatest and noblest not only in his Rank but in every public and private Virtue But here whilst my Gratitude for the princely Benefactions of the Duke of  Bedford  bursts from my Heart you must forgive my reminding you  that it was vou who first recommended me to the Notice of my Benefactor  And what are your Objections to the Allowance of the Honour which I have solicited Why you have commended the Book so warmly that you should be ashamed of reading your Name before the Dedication Indeed Sir if the Book itself doth not make you ashamed of your Commendations nothing that I can here write will or ought I am not to give up my Right to your Protection and Patronage because you have commended my Book For though I acknowledge so many Obligations to you I do not add this to the Number in which Friendship I am convinced hath so little Share Since that can neither biass your Judgment nor pervert your Integrity An Enemy may at any Time obtain your Commendation by only deserving it and the utmost which the Faults of your Friends can hope for is your Silence or perhaps if too severely accused your gentle Palliation  In short Sir I suspect that your Dislike of public Praise is your true Objection to granting my Request I have observed that you have in common with my two other Friends an Unwillingness to hear the least Mention of your own Virtues that as a great Poet says of one of you he might justly have said it of all three you  Do Good by stealth and blush to find it Fame  If Men of this Disposition are as careful to shun Applause as others are to escape Censure how just must be your Apprehension of your Character falling into my Hands since what would not a Man have Reason to dread if attacked by an Author who had received from him Injuries equal to my Obligations to you  And will not this dread of Censure increase in Proportion to the Matter which a Man is conscious of having afforded for it If his whole Life for Instance should have been one continued Subject of Satire he may well tremble when an incensed Satyrist takes him in Hand Now Sir if we apply this to your modest Aversion to Panegyric how reasonably will your Fears of me appear  Yet surely you might have gratified my Ambition from this single Consideration that I shall always prefer the Indulgence of your Inclinations to the Satisfaction of my own A very strong Instance of which I shall give you in this Address in which I am determined to follow the Example of all other Dedicators and will consider not what my Patron really deserves to have written but what he will be best pleased to read  Without further Preface then I here present you with the Labours of some Years of my Life What Merit these Labours have is already known to yourself If from your favourable Judgment I have conceived  some esteem for them it cannot be imputed to Vanity since I should have agreed as implicitly to your Opinion had it been given in Favour of any other Man's Production Negatively at least I may be allowed to say that had I been sensible of any great Demerit in the Work you are the last Person to whose Protection I would have ventured to recommend it  From the Name of my Patron indeed I hope my Reader will be convinced at his very Entrance on this Work that he will find in the whole Course of it nothing prejudicial to the Cause of Religion and Virtue nothing inconsistent with the strictest Rules of Decency nor which can offend even the chastest Eye in the Perusal On the contrary I declare that to recommend Goodness and Innocence hath been my sincere Endeavour in this History This honest Purpose you have been pleased to think I have attained And to say the Truth it is likeliest to be attained in Books of this Kind for an Example is a Kind of Picture in which Virtue becomes as it were an Object of Sight and strikes us with an Idea of that Loviliness which  Plato  asserts there is in her naked Charms  Besides displaying that Beauty of Virtue which may attract the Admiration of Mankind I have attempted to engage a stronger Motive to Human Action in her Favour by convincing Men that their true Interest  directs them to a pursuit of her For this Purpose I have shewn that no Acquisitions of Guilt can compensate the Loss of that solid inward Comfort of Mind which is the sure Companion of Innocence and Virtue nor can in the least balance the Evil of that Horror and Anxiety which in their Room Guilt introduces into our Bosoms And again that as these Acquisitions are in themselves generally worthless so are the Means to attain them not only base and infamous but at best incertain and always full of Danger Lastly I have endeavoured strongly to inculcate that Virtue and Innocence can scarce ever be injured but by Indiscretion and that it is this alone which often betrays them into the Snares that Deceit and Villainy spread for them A Moral which I have the more industriously laboured as the teaching it is of all others the likeliest to be attended with Success since I believe it is much easier to make good Men wise than to make bad Men good  For these Purposes I have employed all the Wit and Humour of which I am Master in the following History wherein I have endeavoured to laugh Mankind out of their favourite Follies and Vices How far I have succeeded in this good Attempt I shall submit to the candid Reader with only two Requests First That he will not expect to find Perfection in this Work and Secondly  That he will excuse some Parts of it if they fall short of that little Merit which I hope may appear in others  I will detain you Sir no longer Indeed I have run into a Preface while I professed to write a Dedication But how can it be otherwise I dare not praise you and the only Means I know of to avoid it when you are in my Thoughts are either to be entirely silent or to turn my Thoughts to some other Subject  Pardon therefore what I have said in this Epistle not only without your Consent but absolutely against it and give me at least Leave in this public Manner to declare that I am with the highest Respect and Gratitude  SIR  Your most Obliged Obedient Humble Servant Henry Fielding  CONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME  BOOK I

and his Sister  p  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK I  Containing as much of the Birth of the Foundling as is necessary or proper to acquaint the Reader with in the Beginning of this History  CHAP I  The Introduction to the Work or Bill of Fare to the Feast  AN Author ought to consider himself not as a Gentleman who gives a private or eleemosynary Treat but rather as one who keeps a publick Ordinary at which all Persons are welcome for their Money In the former Case it is well known that the Entertainer provides what Fare he pleases and tho' this should be very indifferent and utterly disagreeable to the Taste of his Company they must not find any Fault nay on the contrary GoodBreeding forces them outwardly to approve and to commend whatever is set before them Now the contrary of this happens to the Master of an Ordinary  Men who pay for what they eat will insist on gratifying their Palates however nice and even whimsical these may prove and if every Thing is not agreeable to their Taste will challenge a Right to censure to abuse and to dm their Dinner without controul  To prevent therefore giving Offence to their Customers by any such Disappointment it hath been usual with the honest and wellmeaning Host to provide a Bill of Fare which all Persons may peruse at their first Entrance into the House and having thence acquainted themselves with the Entertainment which they may expect may either stay and regale with what is provided for them or may depart to some other Ordinary better accommodated to their Taste  As we do not disdain to borrow Wit or Wisdom from any Man who is capable of lending us either we have condescended to take a Hint from these honest Victuallers and shall prefix not only a general Bill of Fare to our whole Entertainment but shall likewise give the Reader particular Bills to every Course which is to be served up in this and the ensuing Volumes  The Provision then which we have here made is no other than HUMAN NATURE Nor do I fear that my sensible Reader though most luxurious in his Taste will start cavil or be offended because I have named but one Article The Tortoise as the Alderman of  Bristol  well learned in eating knows by much Experience besides the delicious  Calibash  and  Calipee  contains many different Kinds of Food nor can the learned Reader be ignorant that in  Human Nature  tho' here collected under one general Name is such prodigious Variety that a Cook will have sooner gone through all the several Species of animal and vegetable Food in the  World than an Author will be able to exhaust so extensive a Subject  An Objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate that this Dish is too common and Vulgar for what else is the Subject of all Romances Novels Plays and Poems with which the Stalls abound Many exquisite Viands might be rejected by the Epicure if it was a sufficient Cause for his contemning of them as common and vulgar that something was to be found in the most paultry Alleys under the same Name In reality true Nature is as difficult to be met with in Authors as the  Bayonne  Ham or  Bologna  Sausage is to be found in the Shops  But the whole to continue the same Metaphor consists in the Cookery of the Author for as Mr  Pope  tells us  True Wit is Nature to Advantage drest  What oft' was thought but ne'er so well exprest  The same Animal which hath the Honour to have some Part of his Flesh eaten at the Table of a Duke may perhaps be degraded in another Part and some of his Limbs gibbeted as it were in the vilest Stall in Town Where then lies the Difference between the Food of the Nobleman and the Porter if both were at Dinner on the same Ox or Calf but in the seasoning the dressing the garnishing and the setting forth Hence the one provokes and incites the most languid Appetite and the other turns and palls that which is the sharpest and keenest  In like manner the Excellence of the mental Entertainment consists less in the Subject than in the Author's Skill in dressing it up How pleased therefore will the Reader be to find that we  have in the following Work adhered closely to one of the highest Principles of the best Cook which the present Age or perhaps that of  Heliogabalus  hath produced This great Man as is well known to all polite Lovers of eating begins at first by setting plain Things before his hungry Guests rising afterwards by Degrees as their Stomachs may be supposed to decrease to the very Quintessence of Sauce and Spices In like manner we shall represent Human Nature at first to the keen Appetite of our Reader in that more plain and simple Manner in which it is found in the Country and shall hereafter hash and ragoo it with all the high  French  and  Italian  Seasoning of Affectation and Vice which Courts and Cities afford By these Means we doubt not but our Reader may be rendered desirous to read on for ever as the great Person just abovementioned is supposed to have made some Persons eat  Having premised thus much we will now detain those who like our Bill of Fare no longer from our Diet and shall proceed directly to serve up the first Course of our History for their Entertainment  CHAP II  A short Description of 'Squire  Allworthy  and a fuller Account of Miss  Bridget Allworthy  his Sister  IN that Part of the Western Division of this Kingdom which is commonly called  Somersetshire  ther  lately lived and perhaps lives still a Gentleman whose Name was  Allworthy  and who might well be called the Favourite of both Nature and Fortune for both of these seem to have contended  which should bless and enrich him most In this Contention Nature may seem to some to have come off victorious as she bestowed on him many Gifts while Fortune had only one Gift in her Power but in pouring forth this she was so very profuse that others perhaps may think this single Endowment to have been more than equivalent to all the various Blessings which he enjoyed from Nature From the former of these he derived an agreeable Person a sound Constitution a solid Understanding and a benevolent Heart by the latter he was decreed to the Inheritance of one of the largest Estates in the County  This Gentleman had in his Youth married a very worthy and beautiful Woman of whom he had been extremely fond By her he had three Children all of whom died in their Infancy He had likewise had the Misfortune of burying this beloved Wife herself about five Years before the Time in which this History chuses to set out This Loss however great he bore like a Man of Sense and Constancy tho' it must be confest he would often talk a little whimsically on this Head For he sometimes said he looked on himself still as married and considered his Wife as only gone a little before him a Journey which he should most certainly sooner or later take after her and that he had not the least Doubt of meeting her again in a Place where he should never part with her more Sentiments for which his Sense was arraigned by one Part of his Neighbours his Religion by a second and his Sincerity by a third  He now lived for the most Part retired in the Country with one Sister for whom he had a very tender Affection This Lady was now somewhat past the Age of an Aera at which in the Opinion of the malicious the Title of Old Maid  may with no Impropriety be assumed She was of that Species of Women whom you rather commend for good Qualities than Beauty and who are generally called by their own Sex very good Sort of Womenas good a Sort of Woman Madam as you would wish to know Indeed she was so far from regretting Want of Beauty that she never mention'd that Perfection if it can be called one without Contempt and would often thank God she was not as handsome as Miss such a one whom perhaps Beauty had led into Errors which she might have otherwise avoided Miss  Bridget Allworthy  for that was the Name of this Lady very rightly conceived the Charms of Person in a Woman to be no better than Snares for herself as well as for others and yet so discreet was she in her Conduct that her Prudence was as much on the Guard as if she had had all the Snares to apprehend which were ever laid for her whole Sex Indeed I have observed tho' it may seem unaccountable to the Reader that this Guard of Prudence like the Trained Bands is always readiest to go on Duty where there is the least Danger It often basely and cowardly deserts those Paragons for whom the Men are all wishing sighing dying and spreading every Net in their Power and constantly attends at the Heels of that higher Order of Women for whom the other Sex have a more distant and awful Respect and whom from Despair I suppose of Success they never venture to attack  Reader I think proper before we proceed any farther together to acquaint thee that I intend to digress through this whole History as often as I see Occasion Of which I am myself a better Judge than any pitiful Critic whatever and here I must desire all those Critics to mind their own  Business and not to intermeddle with Affairs or Works which no ways concern them For till they produce the Authority by which they are constituted Judges I shall plead to their Jurisdiction  CHAP III  An odd Accident which befel Mr  Allworthy  at his Return home The decent Behaviour of Mrs  Deborah Wilkins  with some proper Animadversions on Bastards  I Have told my Reader in the preceding Chapter that Mr  Allworthy  inherited a large Fortune that he had a good Heart and no Family Hence doubtless it will be concluded by many that he lived like an honest Man owed no one a Shilling took nothing but what was his own kept a good House entertained his Neighbours with a hearty Welcome at his Table and was charitable to the Poor  i e  to those who had rather beg than work by giving them the Offals from it that he died immensely rich and built an Hospital  And true it is that he did many of these Things but had he done nothing more I should have left him to have recorded his own Merit on some fair FreeStone over the Door of that Hospital Matters of a much more extraordinary Kind are to be the Subject of this History or I should grossly mispend my Time in writing so voluminous a Work and you my sagacious Friend might with equal Profit and Pleasure travel through some Pages which certain droll Authors have been facetiously pleased to call  The History of England  Mr  Allworthy  had been absent a full Quarter of a Year in  London  on some very particular Business  tho' I know not what it was but judge of its Importance by its having detained him so long from home whence he had not been absent a Month at a Time during the Space of many Years He came to his House very late in the Evening and after a short Supper with his Sister retired much fatigued to his Chamber Here having spent some Minutes on his Knees a Custom which he never broke through on any Account he was preparing to step into Bed when upon opening the Cloaths to his great Surprize he beheld an Infant wrapt up in some coarse Linnen in a sweet and profound Sleep between his Sheets He stood some Time lost in Astonishment at this Sight but as Goodnature was alway the Ascendant in his Mind he soon began to be touched with Sentiments of Compassion for the little Wretch before him He then rang his Bell and ordered an elderly Woman Servant to rise immediately and come to him and in the mean Time was so eager in contemplating the Beauty of Innocence appearing in those lively Colours with which Infancy and Sleep always display it that his Thoughts were too much engaged to reflect that he was in his Shirt when the Matron came in She had indeed given her Master sufficient Time to dress himself for out of Respect to him and Regard to Decency she had spent many Minutes in adjusting her Hair at the Lookingglass notwithstanding all the Hurry in which she had been summoned by the Servant and tho' her Master for ought she knew lay expiring in an Apoplexy or in some other Fit  It will not be wondered at that a Creature who had so strict a Regard to Decency in her own Person should be shocked at the least Deviation from it in another She therefore no sooner opened  the Door and saw her Master standing by the Bedside in his Shirt with a Candle in his Hand than she started back in a most terrible Fright and might perhaps have swooned away had he not now recollected his being undrest and put an End to her Terrors by desiring her to stay without the Door till he had thrown some Cloaths over his Back and was become incapable of shocking the pure Eyes of Mrs  Deborah Wilkins  who tho' in' the d Year of her Age vowed she had never beheld a Man without his Coat Sneerers and prophane Wits may perhaps laugh at her first Fright yet my graver Reader when he considers the Time of Night the Summons from her Bed and the Situation in which she found her Master will highly justify and applaud her Conduct unless the Prudence which must be supposed to attend Maidens at that Period of Life at which Mrs  Deborah  had arrived should a little lessen his Admiration  When Mrs  Deborah  returned into the Room and was acquainted by her Master with the finding the little Infant her Consternation was rather greater than his had been nor could she refrain from crying out with great Horror of Accent as well as Look 'My good Sir what's to be done" Mr  Allworthy  answered she must take care of the Child that Evening and in the Morning he would give Orders to provide it a Nurse 'Yes Sir' says she' and I hope your Worship will send out your Warrant to take up the Hussy its Mother for she must be one of the Neighbourhood and I should be glad to see her committed to  Bridewel  and whipt at the Cart's Tail Indeed such wicked Sluts cannot be two severely punished I'll warrant 'tis not her first by her Impudence in laying it to your Worship' In laying it to me  Deborah'  answered  Allworthy'  'I can't think she  hath any such Design I suppose she hath only taken this Method to provide for her Child and truly I am glad she hath not done worse' I don't know what is worse' cries  Deborah  than for such wicked Strumpets to lay their Sins at honest Mens Doors and though your Worship knows your own Innocence yet the World is censorious and it hath been many an honest Man's Hap to pass for the Father of Children he never begot and if your Worship should provide for the Child it may make the People the apter to believe Besides why should your Worship provide for what the Parish is obliged to maintain For my own Part if it was an honest Man's Child indeed but for my own Part it goes against me to touch those misbegotton Wretches whom I don't look upon as my Fellow Creatures Faugh how it stinks It doth not smell like a Christian If I might be so bold to give my Advice I would have it put in a Basket and sent out and laid at the ChurchWarden's Door It is a good Night only a little rainy and windy and if it was well wrapt up and put in a warm Basket it is two to one but it lives 'till it is found in the Morning But if it should not we have discharged our Duty in taking proper care of it and it is perhaps better for such Creatures to die in a state of Innocence than to grow up and imitate their Mothers for nothing better can be expected of them'  There were some Strokes in this Speech which perhaps would have offended Mr  Allworthy  had he strictly attended to it but he had now got one  of his Fingers into the Infant's Hand which by its gentle Pressure seeming to implore his Assistance had certainly outpleaded the Eloquence of Mrs  Deborah  had it been ten times greater than it was  He now gave Mrs  Deborah  positive Orders to take the Child to her own Bed and to call up a Maidservant to provide it Pap and other things against it waked He likewise ordered that proper Clothes should be procured for it early in the Morning and that it should be brought to himself as soon as he was stirring  Such was the Discernment of Mrs  Wilkins  and such the Respect she bore her Master under whom she enjoyed a most excellent Place that her Scruples gave way to his peremptory Commands and she took the Child under her Arms without any apparent Disgust at the Illegality of its Birth and declaring it was a sweet little Infant walked off with it to her own Chamber  Allworthy  here betook himself to those pleasing Slumbers which a Heart that hungers after Goodness is apt to enjoy when thoroughly satisfied As these are possibly sweeter than what are occasioned by any other hearty Meal I should take more Pains to display them to the Reader if I knew any Air to recommend him to for the procuring such an Appetite  CHAP IV  The Reader's Neck brought into Danger by a Description his Escape and the great Condescention of Miss  Bridget Allworthy  THE  Gothick  Stile of Building could produce nothing nobler than Mr  Allworthy'  s House There was an Air of Grandeur in it that struck you with Awe and rival'd the Beauties of the best  Grecian  Architecture and it was as commodious within as venerable without  It stood on the Southeast Side of a Hill but nearer the Bottom than the Top of it so as to be sheltered from the Northeast by a Grove of old Oaks which rose above it in a gradual Ascent of near half a Mile  and yet high enough to enjoy a most charming Prospect of the Valley beneath  In the midst of the Grove was a fine Lawn sloping down towards the House near the Summit of which rose a plentiful Spring gushing out of a Rock covered with Firs and forming a constant Cascade of about thirty Foot not carried down a regular Flight of Steps but tumbling in a natural Fall over the broken and mossy Stones till it came to the bottom of the Rock then running off in a pebly Channel that with many lesser Falls winded along till it fell into a Lake at the Foot of the Hill about a quarter of a Mile below the House on the South Side and which was seen from every Room in the Front Out of this Lake which filled the Center of a beautiful Plain embellished with Groupes of Beeches and Elms and fed with Sheep issued a River that for several Miles was seen to meander through an amazing Variety of Meadows and Woods till it emptied itself into the Sea with a large Arm of which and an Island beyond it the prospect was closed  On the right of this Valley opened another of less Extent adorned with several Villages and terminated by one of the Towers of an old ruined Abbey grown over with Ivy and Part of the Front which remained still entire  The left Hand Scene presented the View of a fine Park composed of very unequal Ground and agreeably varied with all the Diversity that Hills Lawns Wood and Water laid out with admirable Taste but owing less to Art than to Nature could give Beyond this the Country gradually rose into a Ridge of wild Mountains the Tops of which were above the Clouds  It was now the Middle of  May  and the Morning was remarkably serene when Mr  Allworthy  walked forth on the Terrace where the Dawn opened every Minute that lovely Prospect we have before described  to his Eye And now having sent forth Streams of Light which ascended the blue Firmament before him as Harbingers preceding his Pomp in the full Blaze of his Majesty rose the Sun than which one Object alone in this lower Creation could be more glorious and that Mr  Allworthy  himself presented a human Being replete with Benevolence meditating in what manner he might render himself most acceptable to his Creator by doing most good to his Creatures  Reader take care I have unadvisedly led thee to the Top of as high a Hill as Mr  Allworthy'  s and how to get thee down without breaking thy Neck I do not well know However let us e'en venture to slide down together for Miss  Bridget  rings her Bell and Mr  Allworthy  is summoned to Breakfast where I must attend and if you please shall be glad of your Company  The usual Compliments having past between Mr  Allworthy  and Miss  Bridget  and the Tea being poured out he summoned Mrs  Wilkins  and told his Sister he had a Present for her for which she thanked him imagining I suppose it had been a Gown or some Ornament for her Person Indeed he very often made her such Presents and she in Complaisance to him spent much time in adorning herself I say in Complaisance to him because she always exprest the greatest Contempt for Dress and for those Ladies who made it their Study  But if such was her Expectation how was she disappointed when Mrs  Wilkins  according to the Order she had receiv'd from her Master produced the little Infant Great Surprises as hath been observed are apt to be silent and so was Miss  Bridget  'till her Brother began and told her the whole Story which as the Reader knows already we shall not repeat  Miss  Bridget  had always exprest so great a regard for what the Ladies are pleased to call Virtue and  had herself maintained such a Severity of Character that it was expected especially by  Wilkins  that she would have vented much Bitterness on this Occasion and would have voted for sending the Child as a kind of noxious Animal immediately out of the House but on the contrary she rather took the goodnatur'd side of the question intimated some Compassion for the helpless little Creature and commended her Brother's Charity in what he had done  Perhaps the Reader may account for this Behaviour from her Condescension to Mr  Allworthy  when we have informed him that the good Man had ended his Narrative with owning a Resolution to take care of the Child and to breed him up as his own for to acknowledge the Truth she was always ready to oblige her Brother and very seldom if ever contradicted his Sentiments she would indeed sometimes make a few Observations as that Men were headstrong and must have their own way and would wish she had been blest with an independent Fortune but these were always vented in a low Voice and at the most amounted only to what is called Muttering  However what she withheld from the Infant she bestowed with the utmost Profuseness on the poor unknown Mother whom she called an impudent Slut a wanton Hussy an audacious Harlot a wicked Jade a vile Strumpet with every other Appellation with which the Tongue of Virtue never fails to lash those who bring a Disgrace on the Sex  A Consultation was now entered into how to proceed in order to discover the Mother A Scrutiny was first made into the Characters of the female Servants of the House who were all acquitted by Mrs  Wilkins  and with apparent Merit for she had collected them herself and perhaps it would be difficult to find such another Set of Scarecrows  The next Step was to examine among the Inhabitants  of the Parish and this was referred to Mrs  Wilkins  who was to enquire with all imaginable Diligence and to make her Report in the Afternoon  Matters being thus settled Mr  Allworthy  withdrew to his Study as was his Custom and left the Child to his Sister who at his Desire had undertaken the Care of it  CHAP V  Containing a few common Matters with a very uncommon Observation upon them  WHEN her Master departed Mrs  Deborah  stood silent expecting her Cue from Miss  Bridget  for as to what had past before her Master the prudent Housekeeper by no means relied upon it as she had often known the Sentiments of the Lady in her Brother's Absence to differ greatly from those which she had expressed in his Presence Miss  Bridget  did not however suffer her to continue long in this doubtful Situation for having looked some time earnestly at the Child as it lay asleep in the Lap of Mrs  Deborah  the good Lady could not forbear giving it a hearty Kiss at the same time declaring herself wonderfully pleased with its Beauty and Innocence Mrs  Deborah  no sooner observed this than she fell to squeezing and kissing with as great Raptures as sometimes inspire the sage Dame of forty and five towards a youthful and vigorous Bridegroom crying out in a shrill Voice 'O the dear little Creature the dear sweet pretty Creature well I vow it is as fine a Boy as ever was seen'  These Exclamations continued 'till they were interrupted by the Lady who now proceeded to  execute the Commission given her by her Brother and gave Orders for providing all Necessaries for the Child appointing a very good Room in the House for his Nursery Her Orders were indeed so liberal that had it been a Child of her own she could not have exceeded them but lest the virtuous Reader may condemn her for shewing too great Regard to a baseborn Infant to which all Charity is condemned by Law as irreligious we think proper to observe that she concluded the whole with saying 'Since it was her Brother's Whim to adopt the little Brat she supposed little Master must be treated with great Tenderness for her part she could not help thinking it was an Encouragement to Vice but that she knew too much of the Obstinacy of Mankind to oppose any of their ridiculous Humours'  With Reflections of this nature she usually as hath been hinted accompany'd every Act of Compliance with her Brother's Inclinations and surely nothing could more contribute to heighten the Merit of this Compliance than a Declaration that she knew at the same time the Folly and Unreasonableness of those Inclinations to which she submitted Tacit Obedience implies no Force upon the Will and consequently may be easily and without any Pains preserved but when a Wife a Child a Relation or a Friend performs what we desire with Grumbling and Reluctance with Expressions of Dislike and Dissatisfaction the manifest Difficulty which they undergo must greatly enhance the Obligation  As this is one of those deep Observations which very few Readers can be supposed capable of making themselves I have thought proper to lend them my Assistance but this is a Favour rarely to be expected in the Course of my Work Indeed I shall  seldom or never so indulge him unless in such Instances as this where nothing but the Inspiration with which we Writers are gifted can possibly enable any one to make the Discovery  CHAP VI  Mrs  Deborah  is introduced into the Parish with a Simile A short Account of  Jenny Jones  with the Difficulties and Discouragements which may attend young Women in the Pursuit of Learning  MRS  Deborah  having disposed of the Child according to the Will of her Master now prepared to visit those Habitations which were supposed to conceal its Mother  Not otherwise than when a Kite tremendous Bird is beheld by the feathered Generation soaring aloft and hovering over their Heads the amorous Dove and every innocent little Bird spread wide the Alarm and fly trembling to their Hidingplaces He proudly beats the Air conscious of his Dignity and meditates intended Mischief  So when the Approach of Mrs  Deborah  was proclaimed through the Street all the Inhabitants ran trembling into their Houses each Matron dreading lest the Visit should fall to her Lot She with stately Steps proudly advances over the Field aloft she bears her tow'ring Head filled with Conceit of her own Preeminence and Schemes to effect her intended Discovery  The sagacious Reader will not from this Simile imagine these poor People had any Apprehension of the Design with which Mrs  Wilkins  was now coming towards them but as the great Beauty of the Simile may possibly sleep these hundred  Years till some future Commentator shall take this Work in hand I think proper to lend the Reader a little Assistance in this Place  It is my Intention therefore to signify that as it is the Nature of a Kite to devour little Birds so is it the Nature of such Persons as Mrs  Wilkins  to insult and tyrannize over little People This being indeed the Means which they use to recompense to themselves their extreme Servility and Condescension to their Superiors for nothing can be more reasonable than that Slaves and Flatterers should exact the same Taxes on all below them which they themselves pay to all above them  Whenever Mrs  Deborah  had had Occasion to exert any extraordinary Condescension to Mrs  Bridget  and by that means had a little sowered her natural Disposition it was usual with her to walk forth among these People in order to refine her Temper by venting and as it were purging off all ill Humours on which Account she was by no means a welcome Visitant to say the Truth she was universally hated and dreaded by them all  On her Arrival in this Place she went immediately to the Habitation of an elderly Matron to whom as this Matron had the good Fortune to resemble herself in the Comeliness of her Person as well as in her Age she had generally been more favourable than to any of the rest To this Woman she imparted what had happened and the Design upon which she was come thither that Morning These two began presently to scrutinize the Characters of the several young Girls who lived in any of those Houses and at last fixed their strongest Suspicion on one  Jenny Jones  who they both agreed was the likeliest Person to have committed this Fact  This  Jenny Jones  was no very comely Girl either in her Face or Person but Nature had somewhat compensated the Want of Beauty with what is generally more esteemed by those Ladies whose Judgment is arrived at Years of perfect Maturity for she had given her a very uncommon Share of Understanding This Gift  Jenny  had a good deal improved by Erudition She had lived several Years a Servant with a Schoolmaster who discovering a great Quickness of Parts in the Girl and an extraordinary Desire of Learning for every leisure Hour she was always found reading in the Books of the Scholars had the Goodnature or Folly which the Reader pleases to call it to instruct her so far that she obtained a very competent Skill in the Latin Language and was perhaps as good a Scholar as most of the young Men of Quality of the Age This Advantage however like most others of an extraordinary Kind was attended with some small Inconveniencies For as it is not to be wondered at that a young Woman so well accomplished should have lIttle Relish for the Society of those whom Fortune had made her Equals but whom Education had rendered so much her Inferiors so is it Matter of no greater Astonishment that this Superiority in  Jenny  together with that Behaviour which is its certain Consequence should produce among the others some little Envy and illwill towards her and these had perhaps secretly burnt in the Bosoms of her Neighbours ever since her Return from her Service  Their Envy did not however display itself openly till poor  Jenny  to the Surprize of every Body and to the Vexation of all the young Women in these Parts had publickly shone forth on a  Sunday  in a new Silk Gown with a laced Cap and other proper Appendages to these  The Flame which had before lain in Embrio now burst forth  Jenny  had by her Learning encreased her own Pride which none of her Neighbours were kind enough to feed with the Honour she seemed to demand and now instead of Respect and Adoration she gained nothing but Hatred and Abuse by her Finery The whole Parish declared she could not come honestly by such Things and Parents instead of wishing their Daughters the same felicitated themselves that their Children had them not  Hence perhaps it was that the good Woman first mentioned the Name of this poor Girl to Mrs  Wilkins  but there was another Circumstance that confirmed the latter in her Suspicion For  Jenny  had lately been often at Mr  Allworthy'  s House She had officiated as Nurse to Miss  Bridget  in a Violent Fit of Illness and had sat up many Nights with that Lady besides which she had been seen there the very Day before Mr  Allworthy'  s Return by Mrs  Wilkins  herself tho' that sagacious Person had not at first conceived any Suspicion of her on that Account For as she herself said 'She had always esteemed  Jenny  as a very sober Girl tho' indeed she knew very little of her and had rather suspected some of those wanton Trollops who gave themselves Airs because forsooth they thought themselves handsome'  Jenny  was now summoned to appear in Person before Mrs  Deborah  which she immediately did When Mrs  Deborah  putting on the Gravity of a Judge with somewhat more than his Austerity began an Oration with the Words 'You audacious Strumpet' in which she proceeded rather to pass Sentence on the Prisouer than to accuse her  Tho' Mrs  Deborah  was fully satisfied of the Guilt of  Jenny  for the Reason above shewn it is  possible Mr  Allworthy  might have required some stronger Evidence to have convicted her but she saved her Accusers any such Trouble by freely confessing the whole Fact with which she was charged  This Confession tho' delivered rather in Terms of Contrition as it appeared did not at all mollify Mrs  Deborah  who now pronounced a second Judgment against her in more opprobrious Language than before nor had it any better Success with the Bystanders who were now grown very numerous Many of them cried out 'They thought what Madam's Silk Gown would end in' others speak sarcastically of her Learning Not a single Female was present but found some Means of expressing her Abhorrence of poor  Jenny  who bore all very patiently except the Malice of one Woman who reflected upon her Person and tossing upon her Nose said 'The Man must have a good Stomach who would give Silk Gowns for such Sort of Trumpery'  Jenny  replied to this with a Bitterness which might have surprized a judicious Person who had observed the Tranquillity with which she bore all the Affronts to her Chastity but her Patience was tired out For this is a Virtue which is very apt to be fatigued by Exercise  Mrs  Deborah  having succeeded beyond her hopes in her Enquiry returned with much Triumph and at the appointed Hour made a faithful Report to Mr  Allworthy  who was much surprized at the Relation for he had heard of the extraordinary Parts and Improvements of this Girl whom he intended to have given in Marriage together with a small Living to a neighbouring Curate His Concern therefore upon this Occasion was at least  equal to the Satisfaction which appeared in Mrs  Deborah  and to many Readers may seem much more reasonable  Mrs  Bridget  blessed herself and said 'For her Part she should never hereafter entertain a good Opinion of any Woman' For  Jenny  had likewise had the Happiness of being much in her good Graces  The prudent Housekeeper was again dispatched to bring the unhappy Culprit before Mr  Allworthy  in order not as it was hoped by some and expected by all to be sent to the House of Correction but to receive wholesome Admonition and Reproof which those who relish that kind of Instructive Writing may peruse in the next Chapter  CHAP VII  Containing such grave Matter that the Reader cannot laugh once through the whole Chapter unless peradventure he should laugh at the Author  WHEN  Jenny  appeared Mr  Allworthy  took her into his Study and spoke to her as follows  'You know Child it is in my Power as a Magistrate to punish you very rigorously for what you have done and you will perhaps be the more apt to fear I should execute that Power because you have in a manner laid your' Sins at my Door  'But perhaps this is one Reason which hath determined me to act in a milder Manner with you For as no private Resentment should ever influence a Magistrate I will be so far from considering your having deposited the Infant in my House as an Aggavation of your Offence that  I will suppose in your Favour this to have proceeded from a natural Affection to your Child since you might have some Hopes to see it thus better provided for than was in the Power of yourself or its wicked Father to provide for it I should indeed have been highly offended with you had you exposed the little Wretch in the manner of some inhuman Mothers who seem no less to have abandoned their Humanity than to have parted with their Chastity It is the other Part of your Offence therefore upon which I intend to admonish you I mean the Violation of your Chastity A Crime however lightly treated it may be by debauched Persons very heinous in itself and very dreadful in its' Consequences  'The heinous Nature of this Offence must be apparent to every Christian inasmuch as it is committed in the Defiance of the Laws of our Religion and of the express Commands of him' who founded that Religion  'And here its Consequences may well be argued to be dreadful for what can be more so than to incur the divine Displeasure by the Breach of the Divine Commands and that in an Instance against which the highest Vengeance is specifically' denounced  'But these Things tho' too little I am afraid regarded are so plain that Mankind however they may want to be reminded can never need Information on this Head A Hint therefore to awaken your Sense of this Matter shall suffice for I would inspire you with Repentance' and not drive you to Desperation  'There are other Consequences not indeed so dreadful or replete with Horror as this and yet such as if attentively considered must one  would think deter all of your Sex at least from' the Commission of this Crime  'For by it you are rendered infamous and driven like Lepers of old out of Society at least from the Society of all but wicked and reprobate Persons for no other will associate with you  'If you have Fortunes you are hereby rendered incapable of enjoying them if you have none you are disabled from acquiring any nay almost of procuring your Sustenance for no Persons of Character will receive you into their Houses Thus you are often driven by Necessity itself into a State of Shame and Misery which unavoidably ends in the Destruction of both Body' and Soul  'Can any Pleasure compensate these Evils Can any Temptation have Sophistry and Delusion strong enough to persuade you to so simple a Bargain Or can any carnal Appetite so overpower your Reason or so totally lay it asleep as to prevent your flying with Affright and Terror from a Crime which carries such Punishment always' with it  'How base and mean must that Woman be how void of that Dignity of Mind and decent Pride without which we are not worthy the Name of human Creatures who can bear to level herself with the lowest Animal and to sacrifice all that is great and noble in her all her Heavenly Part to an Appetite which she hath in common with the vilest Branch of the Creation For no Woman sure will plead the Passion of Love for an Excuse This would be to own herself the meer Tool and Bubble of the Man Love however barbarously we may corrupt and pervert its meaning as it is a laudable is a rational Passion and  can never be violent but when reciprocal for though the Scripture bids us love our Enemies it means not with that servent Love which we naturally bear towards our Friends much less that we should sacrifice to them our Lives and what ought to be dearer to us our Innocence Now in what Light but in that of an Enemy can a reasonable Woman regard the Man who solicits her to entail on herself all the Misery I have above described and who would purchase to himself a short trivial contemptible Pleasure so greatly at her Expence For by the Laws of Custom the whole Shame with all its dreadful Consequences falls entirely upon her Can Love which always seeks the good of its Object attempt to betray a Woman into a Bargain where she is so greatly to be the Loser If such Corrupter therefore should have the Impudence to pretend to real Affection for her ought not the Woman to regard him not only as an Enemy but as the worst of all Enemies a false designing treacherous pretended Friend who intends not only to debauch her Body but' her Understanding at the same Time  Here  Jenny  expressing great Concern  Allworthy  paused a Moment and then proceeded I have talked thus to you Child not to insult you for what is past and irrevocable but to caution and strengthen you for the future Nor should I have taken this Trouble but from some Opinion of your good Sense notwithstanding the dreadful Slip you have made and from some Hopes of your hearty Repentance which are founded on the Openness and Sincerity of your Confession  If these do not deceive me I will take care to convey you from this Scene of your Shame where you shall by being unknown 'avoid  the Punishment which as I have said is allotted to your Crime in this World and I hope by Repentance you will avoid the much heavier Sentence denounced against it in the other Be a good Girl the rest of your Days and Want shall be no Motive to your going astray And believe me there is more Pleasure even in this World in an innocent and' virtuous Life than in one debauched and vicious  'As to your Child let no Thoughts concerning it molest you I will provide for it in a better manner than you can ever hope And now nothing remains but that you inform me who was the wicked Man that seduced you for my Anger against him will be much greater than you have experienced upon this Occasion'  Jenny  now lifted her Eyes from the Ground and with a modest Look and decent Voice thus began  'To know you Sir and not love your Goodness would be an Argument of total want of Sense or Goodness in any one In me it would amount to the highest Ingratitude not to feel in the most sensible manner the great Degree of Goodness you have been pleased to exert on this Occasion As to my Concern for what is past I know you will spare my Blushes the Repetition My future Conduct will much better declare my Sentiments than any Professions I can now make I beg leave to assure you Sir that I take your Advice much kinder than your generous Offer with which you concluded it For as you are pleased to say Sir it is an Instance of your Opinion of my U understanding'Here her Tears flowing apace she stopped a few Moments and then proceeded thus 'Indeed Sir your Kindness overcomes me but I will endeavour  to deserve this good Opinion for if I have the Understanding you are so kindly pleased to allow me such Advice cannot be thrown away upon me I thank you Sir heartily for your intended Kindness to my poor helpless Child he is innocent and I hope will live to be grateful for all the Favours you shall shew him But now Sir I must on my Knees intreat you not to persist in asking me to declare the Father of my Infant I promise you faithfully you shall one Day know but I am under the most solemn Ties and Engagements of Honour as well as the most religious Vows and Protestations to conceal his Name at this Time And I know you too well to think you would desire I should sacrifice either my Honour or my Religion'  Mr  Allworthy  whom the least Mention of these sacred Words was sufficient to stagger hesitated a Moment before he replied and then told her she had done wrong to enter into such Engagements to a Villain but since she had he could not insist on her breaking them He said it was not from a Motive of vain Curiosity he had enquired but in order to punish the Fellow at least that he might not ignorantly confer Favours on the Undeserving  As to these Points  Jenny  satisfied him by the most solemn Assurances that the Man was entirely out of his Reach and was neither subject to his Power nor in any probability of becoming an Object of his Goodness  The Ingenuity of this Behaviour had gained  Jenny  so much Credit with this worthy Man that he easily believed what she told him For as she had disdained to excuse herself by a Lie and had  azarded his farther Displeasure in her present Situation  rather than she would forfeit her Honour or Integrity by betraying another he had but little Apprehension that she would be guilty of Falshood towards himself  He therefore dismissed her with Assurances that he would very soon remove her out of the Reach of that Obloquy she had incurred concluding with some additional Documents in which he recommended Repentance saying "Consider Child 'there is one still to reconcile yourself to whose Favour is of much greater Importance to you than mine'  CHAP VIII  A Dialogue between Mesdames  Bridget  and  Deborah  containing more Amusement but less Instruction than the former  WHEN Mr  Allworthy  had retired to his Study with  Jenny Jones  as hath been seen Mrs  Bridget  with the good Housekeeper had betaken themselves to a Post next adjoining to the said Study whence through the Conveyance of a Keyhole they sucked in at their Ears the Instructive Lecture delivered by Mr  Allworthy  together with the Answers of  Jenny  and indeed every other Particular which passed in the last Chapter  This Hole in her Brother's Study Door was indeed as well known to Mrs  Bridget  and had been as frequently applied to by her as the famous Hole in the Wall was by  Thisbe  of old This served to many good Purposes For by such Means Mrs  Bridget  became often acquainted with her Brothers Inclinations without giving him the Trouble of repeating them to her It is true some Inconveniencies attended this Intercourse and she  had sometimes Reason to cry out with  Thisbe  in  Shakespear  'O wicked wicked Wall' For as Mr  Allworthy  was a Justice of Peace certain Things occured in Examinations concerning the Bastards and such like which are apt to give great Offence to the chaste Ears of Virgins especially when they approach the Age of forty as was the Case of Mrs  Bridget  However she had on such Occasions the Advantage of concealing her Blushes from the Eyes of Men and  De non apparentibus et non existentibus eadem est ratio  In  English  'When a Woman is not seen to blush she doth not blush at all'  Both the good Women kept strict Silence durring the whole Scene between Mr  Allworthy  and the Girl but as soon as it was ended and that Gentleman was out of hearing Mrs  Deborah  could not help exclaiming against the Clemency of her Master and especially against his suffering her to conceal the Father of the Child which she swore she would have out of her before the Sun set  At these words Mrs  Bridget  discomposed her Features with a Smile a Thing very unusual to her Not that I would have my Reader imagine that this was one of those wanton Smiles which  Homer  would have you conceive came from  Venus  when he calls her the laughterloving Goddess nor was it one of those Smiles which Lady  Seraphina  shoots from the StageBox and which  Venus  would quit her Immortality to be able to equal No this was rather one of those Smiles which might be supposed to have come from the dimpled Cheecks of the august  Tysiphone  or from one of the Misses her Sisters  With such a Smile then and with a Voice sweet as the Evening Breeze of  Boreas  in the pleasant Month of  November  Mrs  Bridget  gently  reproved the Curiosity of Mrs  Deborah  a Vice with which it seems the latter was too much tainted and which the former inveighed against with great Bitterness adding 'that among all her Faults she thanked Heaven her Enemies could not accuse her of prying into the Affairs of other People'  She then proceeded to commend the Honour and Spirit with which  Jenny  had acted She said she could not help agreeing with her Brother that there was some Merit in the Sincerity of her Confession and in her Integrity to her Lover That she had always thought her a very good Girl and doubted not but she had been seduced by some Rascal who had been infinitely more to blame than herself and very probably had prevailed with her by a Promise of Marriage or some other treacherous Proceeding  This Behaviour of Mrs  Bridget  greatly surprized Mrs  Deborah  for this wellbred Woman seldom opened her Lips either to her Master or his Sister 'till she had first sounded their Inclinations with which her Sentiments were always strictly consonant Here however she thought she might have launched forth with Safety and the sagacious Reader will not perhaps accuse her of want of sufficient Forecast in so doing but will rather admire with what wonderful Celerity she tacked about when she found herself steering a wrong Course  'Nay Madam' said this able Woman and truly great Politician 'I must own I cannot help admiring the Girl's Spirit as well as your Ladyship And as your 'Ladyship says if she was deceived by some wicked Man the poor Wretch is to be pitied And to be sure as your Ladyship says the Girl hath always appeared  like a good honest plain Girl and not vain of her Face forsooth as some wanton Husseys in' the Neighbourhood are  'You say true  Deborah  said Mrs  Bridget  if the Girl had been one of those vain Trollops of which we have too many in the Parish I should have condemned my Brother for his Lenity towards her I saw two Farmers Daughters at Church the other Day with bare Necks I protest they shock'd me If Wenches will hang out Lures for Fellows it is no matter what they suffer I detest such Creatures and it would be much better for them that their Faces had been seamed with the SmallPox but I must confess I never saw any of this wanton Behaviour in poor  Jenny  some artful Villain I am convinced hath betrayed nay perhaps forc'd her and I pity the poor Wretch with all my Heart'  Mrs  Deborah  approved all these Sentiments and the Dialogue concluded with a general and bitter Invective against Beauty and with many compassionate Considerations for all honest plain Girls who are deluded by the wicked Arts of deceitful Men  CHAP IX  Containing Matters which will surprize the Reader  JENNY  returned home well pleased with the Reception she had met with from Mr  Allworthy  whose Indulgence to her she industrously made public partly perhaps as a Sacrifice to her own Pride and partly from the more prudent Motive of reconciling her Neighbours to her and silencing their Clamours  But though this latter View if she indeed had it may appear reasonable enough yet the Event did not answer her Expectation for when she was convened before the Justice and it was universally apprehended that the House of Correction would have been her Fate tho' some of the young Women cry'd out 'it was good enough for her' and diverted themselves with the Thoughts of her beating Hemp in a Silk Gown yet there were many others who began to pity her Condition But when it was known in what manner Mr  Allworthy  had behaved the Tide turned against her One said ''I'll assure you Madam hath had good Luck' A second cry'd 'See what it is to be a Favourite' A third' Ay this comes of her Learning' Every Person made some malicious Comment or other on the Occasion and reflected on the Partiality of the Justice  The Behaviour of these People may appear impolitic and ungrateful to the Reader who considers the Power and the Benevolence of Mr  Allworthy  But as to his Power he never used it and as to his Benevolence he exerted so much that he had thereby disobliged all his Neighbours For it is a Secret well known to great Men that by conferring an Obligation they do not always procure a Friend but are certain of creating many Enemies  Jenny  was however by the Care and Goodness of Mr  Allworthy  soon removed out of the Reach of Reproach when Malice being no longer able to vent its Rage on her began to seek another Object of its Bitterness and this was no less than Mr  Allworthy  himself for a Whisper soon went abroad that he himself was the Father of the foundling Child  This Supposition so well reconciled his Conduct  to the general Opinion that it met with universal Assent and the Outery against his Lenity soon began to take another Turn and was changed into an Invective against his Cruelty to the poor Girl Very grave and good Women exclaimed against Men who begot Children and then disowned them Nor were there wanting some who after the Departure of  Jenny  insinuated that she was spirited away with a Design too black to be mentioned and who gave frequent Hints that a legal Inquiry ought to be made into the whole Matter and that some People should be forced to produce the Girl  These Calumnies might have probably produced ill Consequences at the least might have occasioned some Trouble to a Person of a more doubtful and suspicious Character than Mr  Allworthy  was blessed with but in his Case they had no such Effect and being heartily despised by him they served only to afford an innocent Amusement to the good Gossips of the Neighbourhood  But as we cannot possibly divine what Complexion our Reader may be of and as it will be some Time before he will hear any more of  Jenny  we think proper to give him a very early Intimation that Mr  Allworthy  was and will hereafter appear to be absolutely innocent of any criminal Intention whatever He had indeed committed no other than an Error in Politics by tempering Justice with Mercy and by refusing to gratify the good natured Disposition of the Mob  Whenever this Word occurs in our Writing it intends Persons without Virtue or Sense in all Stations and many of the highest Rank are often meant by it  with an Object for their Compassion to work on in the Person of poor  Jenny  whom in order to pity they desired to have  seen sacrificed to Ruin and Infamy by a shameful correction in  Bridewel  So far from complying with this their Inclination by which all Hopes of Reformation would have been abolished and even the Gate shut against her if her own Inclinations should ever hereafter lead her to chuse the Road of Virtue Mr  Allworhty  rather chose to encourage the Girl to return thither by the only possible Means for too true I am afraid it is that many Women have become abandoned and have sunk to the last Degree of Vice by being unable to retrieve the first Slip This will be I am afraid always the Case while they remain among their former Acquaintance it was therefore wisely done by Mr  Allworthy  to remove  Jenny  to a Place where she might enjoy the Pleasure of Reputation after having tasted the ill Consequences of losing it  To this Place therefore wherever it was we will wish her a good Journey and for the present take leave of her and of the little Foundling her Child having Matters of much higher Importance to communicate to the Reader  CHAP X  The Hospitality of  Allworthy  with a short Sketch of the Characters of two Brothers a Doctor and a Captain who were entertained by that Gentleman  NEITHER Mr  Allworthy'  s House nor his Heart were shut against any Part of Mankind but they were both more particularly open to Men of Merit To say the Truth this was the only House in the Kingdom where you was sure to gain a Dinner by deserving it  Above all others Men of Genius and Learning shared the principal Place in his Favour and in these he had much Discernment For though he had missed the Advantage of a learned Education yet being blest with vast natural Abilities he had so well profited by a vigorous though late Application to Letters and by much Conversation with Men of Eminence in this Way that he was himself a very competent Judge in most kind of Literature  It is no Wonder that in an Age when this kind of Merit is so little in Fashion and so slenderly provided for that Persons possessed of it should very eagerly flock to a Place where they were sure of being received with great Complaisance indeed where they might enjoy almost the same Advantages of a liberal Fortune as if they were entitled to it in their own Right for Mr  Allworthy  was not one of those generous Persons who are ready most bountifully to bestow Meat Drink and Lodging on Men of Wit and Learning for which they expect no other Return but Entertainment Instruction Flattery and Subserviency in a Word that such Persons should be enrolled in the Number of Domestics without wearing their Master's Cloaths or receiving Wages  On the contrary every Person in this House was perfect Master of his own Time and as he might at his Pleasure satisfy all his Appetites within the Restrictions only of Law Virtue and Religion so he might if his Health required or his Inclination prompted him to Temperance or even to Abstinence absent himself from any Meals or retire from them whenever he was so disposed without even a Solicitation to the contrary For indeed such Solicitations from Superiors always favour very strongly of Commands But all here were free from such Impertinence not only those whose  Company is in all other Places esteemed a Favour from their Equality of Fortune but even those whose indigent Circumstances make such an eleemosynary Abode convenient to them and who are therefore less welcome to a great Man's Table because they stand in need of it  Among others of this Kind was Dr  Blifil  a Gentleman who had the Misfortune of losing the Advantage of great Talents by the Obstinacy of a Father who would breed him to a Profession he disliked In Obedience to this Obstinacy the Doctor had in his Youth been obliged to study Physick or rather to say he studied it for in reality Books of this Kind were almost the only ones with which he was unacquainted and unfortunately for him the Doctor was Master of almost every other Science but that by which he was to get his Bread the Consequence of which was that the Doctor at the Age of Forty had no Bread to eat  Such a Person as this was certain to find a Welcome at Mr  Allworthy'  s Table to whom Misfortunes were ever a Recommendation when they were derived from the Folly or Villany of others and not of the unfortunate Person himself Besides this negative Merit the Doctor had one positive Recommendation This was a great Appearance of Religion Whether his Religion was real or consisted only in Appearance I shall not presume to say as I am not possessed of any Touchstone which can distinguish the true from the false  If this Part of his Character pleased Mr  Allworthy  it delighted Miss  Bridget  She engaged him in many religious Controversies on which Occasions she constantly expressed great Satisfaction in the Doctor's Knowledge and not much less in the Compliments which he frequently bestowed on her own To say the Truth she had read much  English  Divinity and had puzzled more than one of the Neighbouring Curates Indeed her Conversation was so pure her Looks so sage and her whole Deportment so grave and solemn that she seemed to deserve the Name of Saint equally with her Namesake or with any other Female in the  Roman  Kalendar  As Sympathies of all Kinds are apt to beget Love so Experience teaches us that none have a more direct Tendency this Way than those of a religious Kind between Persons of different Sexes The Doctor found himself so agreeable to Miss  Bridget  that he now began to lament an unfortunate Accident which had happened to him aboutten Years before namely his Marriage with another Woman who was not only still alive but what was worse known to be so by Mr  Allworthy  This was a fatal Bar to that Happiness which he otherwise saw sufficient Probability of obtaining with this young Lady for as to criminal Indulgences he certainly never thought of them This was owing either to his Religion as is most probable or to the Purity of his Passion which was fixed on those Things which Matrimony only and not criminal Correspondence could put him in Possession of or could give him any Title to  He had not long ruminated on these Matters before it recurred to his Memory that he had a Brother who was under no such unhappy Incapacity This Brother he made no doubt would succeed for he discerned as he thought an Inclination to Marriage in the Lady and the Reader perhaps when he hears the Brother's Qualifications will not blame the Confidence which he entertained of his Success  This Gentleman was about Years of Age He was of a middle Size and what is called well  built He had a Scar on his Forehead which did not so much injure his Beauty as it denoted his Valour for he was a halfpay Officer He had good Teeth and something affable when he pleased in his Smile though naturally his Countenance as well as his Air and Voice had much of Roughness in it yet he could at any Time deposite this and appear all Gentleness and good Humour He was not ungenteel nor entirely void of Wit and in his Youth had abounded in Spriteliness which though he had lately put on a more serious Character he could when he pleased resume  He had as well as the Doctor an Academic Education for his Father had with the same Paternal Authority we have mentioned before decreed him for holy Orders but as the old Gentleman died before he was ordained he chose the Church Military and preferred the King's Commission to the Bishop's  He had purchased the Post of Lieutenant of Dragoons and afterwards came to be a Captain but having quarrelled with his Colonel was by his Interest obliged to sell from which Time he had entirely rusticated himself had betaken himself to studying the Scriptures and was not a little suspected of an Inclination to  Methodism  It seemed therefore not unlikely that such a Person should succeed with a Lady of so Saintlike a Disposition and whose Inclinations were no otherwise engaged than to the married State in general but why the Doctor who certainly had no great Friendship for his Brother should for his Sake think of making so ill a Return to the Hospitality of  Allworthy  is a Matter not so easy to be accounted for  Is it that some Natures delight in Evil as others are thought to delight in Virtue Or is there a Pleasure in being accessary to a Theft when we cannot  commit it ourselves Or Lastly which Experience seems to make probably have we a satisfaction in aggrandizing our Families even tho' we have not the least Love or Respect for them  Whether any of these Motives operated on the Doctor we will not determine but so the Fact was He sent for his Brother and easily found Means to introduce him at  Allworthy'  s as a Person who intended only a short Visit to himself  The Captain had not been in the House a Week before the Doctor had Reason to felicitate himself on his Discernment The Captain was indeed as great a Master of the Art of Love as  Ovid  was formerly He had besides received proper Hints from his Brother which he failed not to improve to the best Advantage  CHAP XI  Containing many Rules and some Examples concerning falling in love Descriptions of Beauty and other more prudential Inducements to Matrimony  IT hath been observed by wise Men or Women I forget which that all Persons are doomed to be in Love once in their Lives No particular Season is as I remember assigned for this but the Age at which Miss  Bridget  was arrived seems to me as proper a Period as any to be fixed on for this Purpose It often indeed happens much earlier but when it doth not I have observed it seldom or never fails about this Time Moreover we may remark that at this Season Love is of a more serious and steady Nature than what some times shews itself in the younger Parts of Life The Love of Girls is uncertain capricious and  so foolish that we cannot always discover what the young Lady would be at nay it may almost be doubted whether she always knows this herself  Now we are never at a Loss to discern this in Women about Forty for as such grave serious and experienced Ladies well know their own Meaning so it is always very easy for a Man of the least Sagacity to discover this with the utmost Certainty  Miss  Bridget  is an Example of all these Observations She had not been many Times in the Captain's Company before she was seized with this Passion Nor did she go pining and moping about the House like a puny foolish Girl ignorant of her Distemper She felt she knew and she enjoyed the pleasing Sensation of which as she was certain it was not only innocent but laudable she was neither afraid nor ashamed  And to say the Truth there is in all Points great Difference between the reasonable Passion which Women at this Age conceive towards Men and the idle and childish Liking of a Girl to a Boy which is often fixed on the Outside only and on Things of little Value and no Duration as on Cherry Cheeks small Lilywhite Hands slowblack Eyes flowing Locks downy Chins dapper Shapes nay sometimes on Charms more worthless than these and less the Party's own such are the outward Ornaments of the Person and for which Men are beholden to the Taylor the Laceman the Perriwigmaker the Hatter and the Milliner and not to Nature Such a Passion Girls may well be ashamed as they generally are to own either to themselves or to others  The Love of Miss  Bridget  was of another Kind The Captain owed nothing to any of these Fopmakers in his Dress nor was his Person much more beholden to Nature Both his Dress and  Person were such as had they appeared in an Assembly or a Drawingroom would have been the Contempt and Ridicule of all the fine Ladies there The former of these was indeed neat but plain coarse illfancied and out of Fashion As for the latter we have expressly described it above So far was the Skin on his Cheeks from being Cherrycoloured that you could not discern what the natural Colour of his Cheeks was they being totally overgrown by a black Beard which ascended to his Eyes His Shape and Limbs were indeed exactly proportioned but so large that they denoted the Strength rather of a Ploughman than any other His Shoulders were broad beyond all Size and the Calves of his Legs larger than those of a common Chairman In short his whole Person wanted all that Elegance and Beauty which is the very reverse of clumsy Strength and which so agreeably sets off most of our fine Gentlemen being partly owing to the high Blood of their Ancestors  viz  Blood made of rich Sauces and generous Wines and partly to an early Town Education  Tho' Miss  Bridget  was a Woman of the greatest Delicacy of Taste yet such were the Charms of the Captain's Conversation that she totally overlooked the Defects of his Person She imagined and perhaps very wisely that she should enjoy more agreeable Minutes with the Captain than with a much prettier Fellow and forewent the Consideration of pleasing her Eyes in order to procure herself much more solid Satisfaction  The Captain no sooner perceived the Passion of Miss  Bridget  in which Discovery he was very quicksighted than he faithfully returned it The Lady no more than her Lover was remarkable for Beauty I would attempt to draw her Picture  but this is done already by a more able Master Mr  Hogarth  himself to whom she sat many Years ago and had been lately exhibited by that Gentleman in his Print of a Winter's Morning of which she was no improper Emblem and may be seen walking for walk she doth in the Print to  CoventGarden  Church with a starved Footboy behind carrying her Prayerbook  The Captain likewise very wisely preferred the more solid Enjoyments he expected with this Lady to the fleeting Charms of Person He was one of those wise Men who regard Beauty in the other Sex as a very worthless and superficial Qualification or to speak more truly who rather chuse to possess every Convenience of Life with an ugly Woman than a handsome one without any of those Conveniencies And having a very good Appitite and but little Nicety he fancied he should play his Part very well at the matrimonial Banquet without the Sauce of Beauty  To deal plainly with the Reader the Captain ever since his Arrival at least from the Moment his Brother had proposed the Match to him long before he had discovered any flattering Symptoms in Miss  Bridget  had been greatly enamoured that is to say of Mr  Allworthy'  s House and Gardens and of his Lands Tenements and Hereditaments of all which the Captain was so passionately fond that he would most probably have contracted Marriage with them had he been obliged to have taken the Witch of  Endor  into the Bargain  As Mr  Allworthy  therefore had declared to the Doctor that he never intended to take a second Wife as his Sister was his nearest Relation and as the Docter had fished out that his Intentions were to make any Child of hers his Heir which indeed the Law without his Interposition would  have done for him the Doctor and his Brother thought it an Act of Benevolence to give Being to a human Creature who would be so plentifully provided with the most essential Means of Happiness The whole Thoughts therefore of both the Brothers were how to engage the Affections of this amiable Lady  But Fortune who is a tender Parent and often doth more for her favourite Offspring than either they deserve or wish had been so industrious for the Captain that whilst he was laying Schemes to excute his Purpose the Lady conceived the same Desires with himself and was on her Side contriving how to give the Captain proper Encouragement without appearing too forward for she was a strict Observer of all Rules of Decorum In this however she easily succeeded for as the Captain was always on the Lookout no Glance Gesture or Word escaped him  The Satisfaction which the Captain received from the kind Behaviour of Miss  Bridget  was not a little abated by his Apprehensions of Mr  Allworthy  for notwithstanding his disinterested Professions the Captain imagined he would when he came to act follow the Example of the rest of the World and refuse his Consent to a Match so disadvantageous in point of Interest to his Sister From what Oracle he received this Opinion I shall leave the Reader to determine but however he came by it it strangely perplexed him how to regulate his Conduct so as at once to convey his Affection to the Lady and to conceal it from her Brother He at length resolved to take all private Opportunities of making his Addresses but in the Presence of Mr  Allworthy  to be as reserved and as much upon his Guard  as was possible and this Conduct was highly approved by the Brother  He soon found Means to make his Addresses in express Terms to his Mistress from whom he receiv'd an Answer in the proper Form  viz  The Answer which was first made some thousands of Years ago and which hath been handed down by Tradition from Mother to Daughter ever since If I was to translate this into Latin I should render it by these two Words  Nolo Episcopari  a Phrase likewise of immemorial Use on another Occasion  The Captain however he came by his Knowledge perfectly well understood the Lady and very soon after repeated his Application with more Warmth and Earnestness than before and was again according to due Form rejected but as he had encreased in the Eagerness of his Desires so the Lady with the same Propriety decreased in the Violence of her Refusal  Not to tire the Reader by leading him through every Scene of this Courtship which tho' in the Opinion of a certain great Author it is the pleasantest Scene of Life to the Actor is perhaps as dull and tiresome as any whatever to the Audience the Captain made his Advances in Form the Citadel was defended in Form and at length in proper Form surrendered at Discretion  During this whole Time which filled the Space of near a Month the Captain preserved great Distance of Behaviour to his Lady in the Presence of the Brother and the more he succeeded with her in private the more reserved was he in public And as for the Lady she had no sooner secured her Lover than she behaved to him before Company with the highest Degree of Indifference so that Mr  Allworthy  must have had the Insight  of the Devil or perhaps some of his worse Qualities to have entertained the least Suspicion of what was going forward  CHAP XII  Containing what the Reader may perhaps expect to find in it  IN all Bargains whether to fight or to Marry or concerning any other such Business little previous Ceremony is required to bring the Matter to an Issue when both Parties are really in earnest This was the Case at present and in less than a Month the Captain and his Lady were Man and Wife  The great Concern now was to break the Matter to Mr  Allworthy  and this was undertaken by the Doctor  One Day then as  Allworthy  was walking in his Garden the Doctor came to him and with great Gravity of Aspect and all the Concern which he could possibly affect in his Countenance said 'I am come Sir to impart an Affair to you of the utmost Consequence but how shall I mention to you what almost distracts me to think of' He then launched forth into the most bitter Invectives both against Men and Women accusing the former of having no Attachment but to their Interest and the latter of being so addicted to vicious Inclinations that they could never be safely trusted with one of the other Sex 'Could I said he Sir have suspected that a Lady of such Prudence such Judgment such Learning should indulge so indiscreet a Passion or could I have imagined that my Brotherwhy do I call him so He is no longer a Brother of mine'  'Indeed but he is said  Allworthy  and a Brother of mine too'Bless me Sir said the Doctor do you know the shocking AffairLook'ee Mr  Blifil  answered the good Man it hath been my constant Maxim in Life to make the best of all Matters which happen My Sister tho' many Years younger than me is at least old enough to be at the Age of Discretion Had he imposed on a Child I should have been more averse to have forgiven him but a Woman upwards of thirty must certainly be supposed to know what will make her most happy She hath married a Gentleman tho' perhaps not quite her Equal in Fortune and if he hath any Perfections in her Eye which can make up that Deficiency I see no Reason why I should object to her Choice of her own Happiness which I no more than herself imagine to consist only in immense Wealth I might perhaps from the many Declarations I have made of complying with almost any Proposal have expected to have been consulted on this Occasion but these Matters are of a very delicate Nature and the Scruples of Modesty perhaps are not to be overcome As to your Brother I have really no Anger against him at all He hath no Obligations to me nor do I think he was under any Necessity of asking my Consent since the Woman is as I have said  Sui Juris  and of a proper Age to be entirely answerable only to herself for her Conduct'  The Doctor repeated his Accusations against his Brother accused Mr  Allworthy  of too great Lenity and declared that he should never more be brought either to see or to own him for his Relation He then launched forth into a Panegyric on  Allworthy'  s Goodness into the highest Encomiums  on his Friendship and concluded by saying he should never forgive his Brother for having put the Place which he bore in that Friendship to a hazard  Allworthy  thus answered 'Had I conceived any Displeasure against your Brother I should never have carried that Resentment to the Innocent But I assure you I have no such Displeasure Your Brother appears to me to be a Man of Sense and Honour I do not disapprove the Taste of my Sister nor will I doubt but that she is equally the Object of his Inclinations I have always thought Love the only Foundation of Happiness in a married State as it can only produce that high and tender Friendship which should always be the Cement of this Union and in my Opinion all those Marriages which are contracted from other Motives are greatly criminal they are a Profanation of a most holy Ceremony and generally end in Disquiet and Misery For surely we may call it a Profanation to convert this most sacred Institution into a wicked sacrifice to Lust or Avarice And what better can be said of those Matches to which Men are induced merely by the Consideration of a' beautiful Person or a great Fortune  'To deny that Beauty is an agreeable Object to the Eye and even worthy some Admiration would be false and foolish Beautiful is an Epithet often used in Scripture and always mentioned with Honour It was my own Fortune to marry a Woman whom the World thought handsome and I can truly say I liked her the better on that Account But to make this the sole Consideration of Marriage to lust after it so violently as to overlook all Imperfections for its Sake or to require it so absolutely as to reject and  disdain Religion Virtue and Sense which are Qualities in their Nature of much higher Perfection because an Elegance of Person only is wanting this is surely inconsistent either with a wise Man or a good Christian And it is perhaps being too charitable to conclude that such Persons mean any thing more by their Marriage than to please their carnal Appetites for the Satisfaction' of which we are taught it was not ordained  'In the next Place with respect to Fortune Worldly Prudence perhaps exacts some Consideration on this Head nor will I absolutely and altogether condemn it As the World is constituted the Demands of a married State and the Care of Posterity require some little Regard to what we call Circumstances Yet this Provision is greatly encreased beyond what is really necessary by Folly and Vanity which create abundantly more Wants than Nature Equipage for the Wife and large Fortunes for the Children are by Custom enrolled in the List of Necessaries and to procure these every thing truly solid and sweet and virtuous and religious' are neglected and overlooked  'And this in many Degrees the last and greatest of which seems scarce distinguishable from Madness I mean where Persons of immense Fortunes contract themselves to those who are and must be disagreeable to them to Fools and Knaves in order to encrease an Estate already larger even than the Demands of their Pleasures Surely such Persons if they will not be thought mad must own either that they are incapable of tasting the sweets of the tenderest Friendship or that they sacrifice the greatest Happiness of which they are capable to the vain uncertain and senseless  Laws of vulgar Opinion which owe as well their Force as their Foundation to Folly'  Here  Allworthy  concluded his Sermon to which  Blifil  had listened with the profoundest Attention tho' it cost him some pains to prevent now and then a small Discomposure of his Muscles He now praised every Period of what he had heard with the warmth of a young Divine who hath the Honour to dine with a Bishop the same Day in which his Lordship had mounted the Pulpit  CHAP XIII  Which concludes the first Book with an Instance of Ingratitude which we hope will appear unnatural  THE Reader from what hath been said may imagine that the Reconciliation if indeed it could be so called was only Matter of Form we shall therefore pass it over and hasten to what must surely be thought Matter of Substance  The Doctor had acquainted his Brother with what had past between Mr  Allworthy  and him and added with a Smile 'I promise you I paid you off nay I absolutely desired the good Gentleman not to forgive you For you know after he had made a Declaration in your Favour I might with Safety venture on such a Request with a Person of his Temper and I was willing as well for your Sake as for my own to prevent the least Possibility of a Suspicion'  Captain  Blifil  took not the least Notice of this at that Time but he afterwards made a very notable Use of it  One of the Maxims which the Devil in a late Visit upon Earth left to his Disciples is when once you are got up to kick the Stool from under  you In plain  English  when you have made your Fortune by the good Offices of a Friend you are advised to discard him as soon you can  Whether the Captain acted by this Maxim I will not positively determine so far we may confidently say that his Actions may be fairly derived from this diabolical Principle and indeed it is difficult to assign any other Motive to them For no sooner was he possessed of Miss  Bridget  and reconciled to  Allworthy  than he began to shew a Coldness to his Brother which encreased daily till at length it grew into Rudeness and became visible to every one  The Doctor remonstrated to him privately concerning this Behaviour but could obtain no other Satisfaction than the following plain Declaration 'If you dislike any thing in my Brother's House Sir you know you are at Liberty to quit it' This strange cruel and almost unaccountable Ingratitude in the Captain absolutely broke the poor Doctor's Heart For Ingratitude never so thoroughly pierces the human Breast as when it proceeds from those in whose Behalf we have been guilty of Transgressions Reflections on great and good Actions however they are received or returned by those in whose Favour they are performed always administer some Comfort to us but what Consolation shall we receive under so biting a Calamity as the ungratefull Behaviour of our Friend when our wounded Conscience at the same Time flies in our Face and upbraids us with having spotted it in the Service of one so worthless  Mr  Allworthy  himself spoke to the Captain in his Brother's Behalf and desired to know what Offence the Doctor had committed when the hardhearted Villain had the Beseness to say that he never should forgive him for the Injury  which he had endeavoured to do him in his Favour which he said he had pumped out of him and was such a cruelty that it ought not to be forgiven  Allworthy  spoke in very high Terms upon this Declaration which he said became not a human Creature He expressed indeed so much Resentment against an unforgiving Temper that the Captain at last pretended to be convinced by his Arguments and outwardly professed to be reconciled  As for the Bride she was now in her Honeymoon and so passionately fond of her new Husband that he never appeared to her to be in the wrong and his Displeasure against any Person was a sufficient Reason for her Dislike to the same  The Captain at Mr  Allworthy'  s Instance was outwardly as we have said reconciled to his Brother yet the same Rancour remained in his Heart and he found so many Opportunities of giving him private Hints of this that the House at last grew insupportable to the poor Doctor and he chose rather to submit to any Inconveniencies which he might encounter in the World than longer to bear these cruel and ungrateful Insults from a Brother for whom he had done so much  He once intended to acquaint  Allworthy  with the whole but he could not bring himself to submit to the Confession by which he must take to his Share so great a Portion of Guilt Besides by how much the worse Man he represented his Brother to be so much the greater would his own Offence appear to Mr  Allworthy  and so much the greater had he Reason to imagine would be his Resentment  He feigned therefore some Excuse of Business for his Departure and promised to return soon again and took leave of his Brother with so welldissembled Content that as the Captain played  his Part to the same Perfection  Allworthy  remained well satisfied with the Truth of the Reconciliation  The Doctor went directly to  London  where he died soon of a broken Heart a Distemper which kills more than is generally imagined and would have a fair Title to a Place in the Bill of Mortality did it not differ in one Instance from all other Diseases  viz  That no Physician can cure it  Now upon the most diligent Enquiry into the former Lives of these two Brothers I find besides the cursed and hellish Maxim of Policy abovementioned another Reason for the Captain's Conduct The Captain besides what we have before said of him was a Man of great Pride and Fierceness and had always treated his Brother who was of a different Complexion and greatly deficient in both these Qualities with the utmost Air of Superiority The Doctor however had much the larger Share of Learning and was by many reputed to have the better Understanding This the Captain knew and could not bear For tho' Envy is at best a very malignant Passion yet is its Bitterness greatly heightened by mixing with Contempt towards the same Object and very much afraid I am that whenever an Obligation is joined to these two Indignation and not Gratitude will be the Product of all three  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK II  Containing Scenes of matrimonial Felicity in different Degrees of Life and various other Transactions during the first two Years after the Marriage between Captain  Blifil  and Miss  Bridget Allworthy  CHAP I  Shewing what Kind of a History this is what it is like and what it is not like  THO' we have properly enough entitled this our Work a History and not a Life nor an Apology for a Life as is more in Fashion yet we intend in it rather to pursue the Method of those Writers who profess to disclose the Revolutions of Countries than to imitate the painful and voluminous Historian who to preserve the Regularity of his Series thinks himself obliged to fill up as much Paper with the Detail of Months and Years in which nothing remarkable happened as he employs upon those Aeras when the greatest Scenes have been transacted on the human Stage  Such Histories as these do in reality very much resemble a NewsPaper which consists of just the same Number of Words whether there be any News in it or not They may likewise be compared to a Stage Coach which performs constantly the same Course empty as well as full The Writer indeed seems to think himself obliged to keep even Pace with Time whose Amanuensis he is and like his Master travels as slowly through Centuries of monkish Dulness when the World seems to have been asleep as through that bright and busy Age so nobly distinguished by the excellent  Latin  Poet  "Ad confligendum venientibus undique paenis  "Omnia cum belli trepido concussa tumultu  "Horrida contremuere sub altis aetheris auris  "In dubioque fuit sub utrorum regna cadendum  "Omnibus humanis esset terraque marique"  Of which we wish we could give our Reader a more adequate Translation than that by Mr  Creech  "When dreadful  Carthage  frighted  Rome  with Arms  "And all the World was shook with fierce Alarms  "Whilst undecided yet which Part should fall  "Which Nation rise the glorious Lord of all  Now it is our purpose in the ensuing Pages to pursue a contrary Method When any extraordinary Scene presents itself as we trust will often be the Case we shall spare no Pains nor Paper to open it at large to our Reader but if whole Years should pass without producing any thing worthy his Notice we shall not be afraid of a Chasm in our History but shall hasten on to Matters of Consequence  and leave such Periods of Time totally unobserved  These are indeed to be considered as Blanks in the grand Lottery of Time We therefore who are the Registers of that Lottery shall imitate those sagacious Persons who deal in that which is drawn at  Guildhall  and who never trouble the Public with the many Blanks they dispose of but when a great Prize happens to be drawn the NewsPapers are presently filled with it and the World is sure to be informed at whose Office it was sold Indeed commonly two or three different Offices lay claim to the Honour of having disposed of it by which I suppose the Adventurers are given to understand that certain Brokers are in the Secrets of Fortune and indeed of her CabinetCouncil  My Reader then is not to be surprized if in the Course of this Work he shall find some Chapters very short and others altogether as long some that contain only the Time of a single Day and others that comprise Years in a word if my History sometimes seems to stand still and sometimes to fly For all which I shall not look on myself as accountable to any Court of Critical Jurisdiction whatever For as I am in reality the Founder of a new Province of Writing so I am at liberty to make what Laws I please therein And these Laws my Readers whom I consider as my Subjects are bound to believe in and to obey with which that they may readily and chearfully comply I do hereby assure them that I shall principally regard their Ease and Advantage in all such Institutions For I do not like a  jure divino  Tyrant imagine that they are my Slaves or my Commodity I am indeed set over them for their own Good only and was created for their Use and not they for mine Nor do I doubt while I make their Interest the great Rule of my Writings they will unanimously  concur in supporting my Dignity and in rendering me all the Honour I shall deserve or desire  CHAP II  Religious Cautions against shewing too much Favour to Bastards and a great Discovery made by Mrs  Deborah Wilkins  EIGHT Months after the Celebration of the Nuptials between Captain  Blifil  and Miss  Bridget Allworthy  a young Lady of great Beauty Merit and Fortune was Miss  Bridget  by reason of a Fright delivered of a fine Boy The Child was indeed to all Appearance perfect but the Midwife discovered it was born a Month before its full Time  Tho' the Birth of an Heir of his beloved Sister was a Circumstance of great Joy to Mr  Allworthy  yet it did not alienate his Affections from the little Foundling to whom he had been Godfather had given his own Name of  Thomas  and whom he had hitherto seldom failed of visiting at least once a Day in his Nursery  He told his Sister if she pleased the newborn Infant should be bred up together with little  Tommy  to which she consented tho' with some little Reluctance For she had truly a great Complaisance for her Brother and hence she had always behaved towards the Foundling with rather more Kindness than Ladies of rigid Virtue can sometimes bring themselves to shew to these Children who however innocent may be truly called the living Monuments of Incontinence  The Captain could not so easily bring himself to bear what he condemned as a Fault in Mr  Allworthy  He gave him frequent Hints that to adopt the Fruits of Sin was to give countenance to it He quoted several Texts for he was well read in Scripture such as  He visits the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children  and  the Fathers have eaten sour Grapes and the Children's Teeth are set on edge c  Whence he argued the Legality of punishing the Crime of the Parent on the Bastard He said 'Tho' the Law did not positively allow the destroying such baseborn Children yet it held them to be the Children of no body that the Church considered them as the Children of no body and that at the best they ought to be brought up to the lowest and vilest Offices of the Commonwealth'  Mr  Allworthy  answered to all this and much more which the Captain had urged on this Subject 'That however guilty the Parents might be the Children were certainly innocent That as to the Texts he had quoted the former of them was a particular denunciation against the  Jews  for the Sin of Idolatry of relinquishing and hating their heavenly King and the latter was parabolically spoken and rather intended to denote the certain and necessary Consequences of Sin than any express Judgment against it But to represent the Almighty as avenging the Sins of the Guilty on the Innocent was indecent if not blasphemous as it was to represent him acting against the first Principles of natural Justice and against the original Notions of Right and Wrong which he himself had implanted in our Minds by which we were to judge not only in all Matters which were not revealed but even of the Truth of Revelation itself He said he knew many held the same Principles with the Captain on this Head but he was himself firmly convinced to the  contrary and would provide in the same Manner for this poor Infant as if a legitimate Child had had the Fortune to have been found in the same Place'  While the Captain was taking all Opportunities to press these and such like Arguments to remove the little Foundling from Mr  Allworthy'  s of whose Fondness for him he began to be jealous Mrs  Deborah  had made a Discovery which in its E+vent threatened at least to prove more fatal to poor  Tommy  than all the Reasonings of the Captain  Whether the insatiable Curiosity of this good Woman had carried her on to that Business or whether she did it to confirm herself in the good Graces of Mrs  Blifil  who notwithstanding he outward Behaviour to the Foundling frequently abused the Infant in private and her Brother too for his Fondness to it I will not determine but she had now as she conceived fully detected the Father of the Foundling  Now as this was a Discovery of great Conse+quence it may be necessary to trace it from the Fountainhead We shall therefore very minutel  lay open those previous Matters by which it was produced and for that Purpose we shall be obli+ged to reveal all the Secrets of a little Family with which my Reader is at present entirely unacquainted and of which the Oeconomy was so rare and ex+traordinary that I fear it will shock the utmost Credulity of many married Persons  CHAP III  The Description of a domestic Government founder upon Rules directly contrary to those of  Aristotle  MY Reader may please to remember he hath been informed that  Jenny Jones  had live some Years with a certain Schoolmaster who  had at her earnest Desire instructed her in  Latin  in which to do justice to her Genius she had so improved herself that she was become a better Scholar than her Master  Indeed tho' this poor Man had undertaken a Profession to which Learning must be allowed necessary this was the least of his Commendations He was one of the bestnatured Fellows in the World and was at the same time Master of so much Pleasantry and Humour that he was reputed the Wit of the Country and all the neighbouring Gentlemen were so desirous of his Company that as denying was not his Talent he spent much Time at their Houses which he might with more Emolument have spent in his School  It may be imagined that a Gentleman so qualified and so disposed was in no danger of becoming formidable to the learned Seminaries of  Eton  or  Westminster  To speak plainly his Scholars were divided into two Classes In the upper of which was a young Gentleman the Son of a neighbouring 'Squire who at the Age of Seventeen was just entered into his Syntaxis and in the lower was a second Son of the same Gentleman who together with several Parishboys was learning to read and write  The Stipend arising hence would hardly have indulged the Schoolmaster in the Luxuries of Life had he not added to this Office those of Clerk and Barber and had not Mr  Allworthy  added to the whole an Annuity of Ten Pound which the poor Man received every Christmas and with which he was enabled to chear his Heart during that sacred Festival  Among his other Treasures the Pedagogue had a Wife whom he had married out of Mr  Allworthy'  s Kitchen for her Fortune  viz  Twenty Pound which she had there amassed  This Woman was not very amiable in her Person Whether she sat to my Friend  Hogarth  or no I will not determine but she exactly resembled the young Woman who is pouring out her Mistress's Tea in the third Picture of the Harlot's Progress She was besides a profest Follower of that notable Sect founded by  Xantippe  of old by means of which she became more formidable in the School than her Husband for to confess the Truth he was never Master there or any where else in her Presence  Tho' her Countenance did not denote much natural Sweetness of Temper yet this was perhaps somewhat soured by a Circumstance which generally poisons matrimonial Felicity For Children are rightly called the Pledges of Love and her Husband tho' they had been married nine Years had given her no such Pledges a Default for which he had no Excuse either from Age or Health being not yet thirty Years old and what they call a jolly brisk young Man  Hence arose another Evil which produced no little Uneasiness to the poor Pedagogue of whom she maintained so constant a Jealousy that he durst hardly speak to one Woman in the Parish for the least Degree of Civility or even Correspondence with any Female was sure to bring his Wife upon her Back and his own  In order to guard herself against matrimonial Injuries in her own House as she kept one Maid Servant she always took Care to chuse her out of that Order of Females whose Faces are taken as a Kind of Security for their Virtue of which Number  Jenny Jones  as the Reader hath been before informed was one  As the Face of this young Woman might be called pretty good Security of the beforementioned  Kind and as her Behaviour had been always extremely modest which is the certain Consequence of Understanding in Woman she had passed above four Years at Mr  Partridge'  s for that was the Schoolmaster's Name without creating the least Suspicion in her Mistress Nay she had been treated with uncommon Kindness and her Mistress had permitted Mr  Partridge  to give her those Instructions which have been before commemorated  But it is with Jealousy as with the Gout When such Distempers are in the Blood there is never any Security against their breaking out and that often on the slightest Occasions and when least suspected  Thus it happened to Mrs  Partridge  who had submitted four Years to her Husband's teaching this young Woman and had suffered her often to neglect her Work in order to pursue her Learning For passing by one Day as the Girl was reading and her Master leaning over her the Girl I know not for what Reason suddenly started up from her Chair and this was the first Time that Suspicion ever entered into the Head of her Mistress  This did not however at that Time discover itself but lay lurking in her Mind like a concealed Enemy who waits for a Reinforcement of additional Strength before he openly declares himself and proceeds upon hostile Operations and such additional Stength soon arrived to corroborate her Suspicion For not long after the Husband and Wife being at Dinner the Master said to his Maid  Da mihi aliquid Potum  upon which the poor Girl smiled perhaps at the Badness of the Latin and when her Mistress cast her Eyes on her blushed possibly with a Consciousness of having laughed at her Master Mrs  Partridge  upon this immediately fell into a Fury and discharged the Trencher on which she was eating at the Head of poor  Jenny  crying out 'You impudent Whore do you play Tricks with my Husband before my Face' and at the same Instant rose from her Chair with a Knife in her Hand with which most probably she would have executed very tragical Vengeance had not the Girl taken the Advantage of being nearer the Door than her Mistress and avoided her Fury by running away for as to the poor Husband whether Surprize had rendered him motionless or Fear which is full as probable had restrained him from venturing at any Opposition he sat staring and trembling in his Chair nor did he once offer to move or speak till his Wife returning from the Pursuit of  Jenny  made some defensive Measures necessary for his own Preservation and he likewise was obliged to retreat after the Example of the Maid  This good Woman was no more than  Othello  of a Disposition  To make a Life of Jealousy  And follow still the Changes of the Moon  With fresh Suspicions  with her as well as him  To be once in doubt  Was once to be resolved  she therefore ordered  Jenny  immediately to pack up her Alls and be gone for that she was determined she should not sleep that Night within her Walls  Mr  Partridge  had profited too much by Experience to interpose in a Matter of this Nature He therefore had Recourse to his usual Recipe of Patience for tho' he was not a great Adept in Latin he remembered and well understood the Advice contained in these Words  Leve fit quod bene fertur Onus  In English 'A Burden becomes lightest when it is well borne'  Which he had always in his Mouth and of which to say the Truth he had often Occasion to experience the Truth  Jenny  offered to make Protestations of her Innocence but the Tempest was too high for her to be heard She betook herself to the Business of Packing for which a small Quantity of brown Paper sufficed and having received her small Pittance of Wages she returned home  The Schoolmaster and his Consort pass'd their Time unpleasantly enough that Evening but something or other happened before the next Morning which a little abated the Fury of Mrs  Partridge  and she at length admitted her Husband to make his Excuse To which she gave the readier Belief as he had instead of desiring her to recall  Jenny  professed a Satisfaction in her being dismissed saying She was grown of little Use as a Servant spending all her time in reading and was become moreover very pert and obstinate For indeed she and her Master had lately had frequent Disputes in Literature in which as hath been said she was become greatly his Superior This however he would by no means allow and as he called her persisting in the Right Obstinacy he began to hate her with no small Invetracy  CHAP IV  Containing one of the most bloody Battles or rather Duels that were ever recorded in Domestic History  FOR the Reasons mentioned in the preceding Chapter and some other matrimonial Concessions well known to most Husbands and which  like the Secrets of Free Masonry should be divulged to none who are not Members of that honourable Fraternity Mrs  Partridge  was pretty well satisfied that she had condemned her Husband without Cause and endeavoured by Acts of Kindness to make him Amends for her false Suspicion Her Passions were indeed equally violent which every Way they inclined for as she could be extremely angry so could she be altogether as fond  But tho' these Passions ordinarily succeeded each other and scarce twentyfour Hours ever passed in which the Pedagogue was not in some Degree the Object of both yet on extraordinary Occasions when the Passion of Anger had raged very high the Remission was usually longer and so was the Case at present for she continued longer in a State of Affability after this Fit of Jealousy was ended than her Husband had ever known before And had it not been for some little Exercises which all the Followers of  Xantippe  are obliged to perform daily Mr  Partridge  would have enjoyed a perfect Serenity of several Months  Perfect Calms at Sea are always suspected by the experienced Mariner to be the Forerunners of a Storm And I know some Persons who without being generally the Devotees of Superstition are apt to apprehend that great and unusual Peace or Tranquillity will be attended with its opposite For which Reason the Antients used on such Occasions to sacrifice to the Goddess  Nemesis  a Deity who was thought by them to look with an invidious Eye on human Felicity and to have a peculiar Delight in overturning it  As we are very far from believing in anysuch Heathen Goddess or from encouraging any Superstition so we wish Mr  John Fr  or some other such Philosopher would bestir himself a little in order  to find out the real Cause of this sudden Transition from good to bad Fortune which hath been so often remarked and of which we shall proceed to give an Instance for it is our Province to relate  acts and we shall leave Causes to Persons of much higher Genius  Mankind have always taken great Delight in knowing and descanting on the Actions of others Hence there have been in all Ages and Nations certain Places set apart for public Rendezvous where the curious might meet and satisfy their mutual Curiosity Among these the Barbers Shops have justly bore the Preeminence Among the  Greeks  Barbers News was a proverbial Expression and  Horace  in one of his Epistles makes honourable Mention of the  Roman  Barbers in the same Light  Those of  England  are known to be no wise inferior to their  Greek  or  Roman  Predecessors You there see foreign Affairs discussed in a Manner little inferior to that with which they are handled in the Coffeehouses and domestick Occurrences are much more largely and freely treated in the former than in the latter But this serves only for the Men Now whereas the Females of this Country especially those of the lower Order do associate themselves much more than those of other Nations our Polity would be highly deficient if they had not some Place set apart likewise for the Indulgence of their Curiosity seeing they are in this no way inferior to the other half of the Species  In enjoying therefore such Place of Rendezvous the  British  Fair ought to esteem themselves more happy than any of their foreign Sisters as I do not remember either to have read in History to have seen in my Travels any thing of the  e Kind  This Place then is no other than the Chandler's Shop the known Seat of all the News or as it is vulgarly called Gossiping in every Parish in  England  Mrs  Partridge  being one Day at this Assembly of Females was asked by one of her Neighbours if she had heard no News lately of  Jenny Jones  To which she answered in the Negative Upon this the other replied with a Smile that the Parish was very much obliged to her for having turned  Jenny  away as she did  Mrs  Partridge  whose Jealousy as the Reader well knows was long since cured and who had no other Quarrel to her Maid answered boldly She did not know any Obligation the Parish had to her on that Account for she believed  Jenny  had scarce left her Equal behind her  'No truly said the Gossip I hope not tho'I fancy we have Sluts enow too' 'Then you have not heard it seems that she hath been brought to bed of two Bastards but as they are not born here my Husband and the other Overseer says we shall not be obliged to keep them'  'Two Bastards' answered Mrs  Partridge  hastily 'you surprize me I don't know whether we must keep them but I am sure they must have been begotten here for the Wench hath not been nine Months gone away'  Nothing can be so quick and sudden as the Operations of the Mind especially when Hope or Fear or Jealousy to which the two others are but Journeymen set it to work It occurred instantly to her that  Jenny  had scarce ever been out of her own House while she lived with her The leaning over the Chair the sudden starting up the Latin the Smile and many other Things rushed upon her all at once The Satisfaction her Husband  expressed in the Departure of  Jenny  appeared now to be only dissembled again in the same Instant to be real and yet to confirm her Jealousy as proceeding from Satiety and a hundred other bad Causes In a Word she was convinced of her Husband's Guilt and immediately left the Assembly in Confusion  As fair  Grimalkin  who though the youngest of the Feline Family degenerates not in Ferosity from the elder Branches of her House and though inferior in Strength is equal in Fierceness to the noble Tyger himself when a little Mouse whom it hath long tormented in Sport escapes from her Clutches for a while frets scolds growls swears but if the Trunk or Box behind which the Mouse lay hid be again removed she flies like Lightning on her Prey and with envenomed wrath bites scratches mumbles and tears the little Animal  Not with less Fury did Mrs  Partridge  fly on the poor Pedagogue Her Tongue Teeth and Hands fell all upon him at once His Wig was in an Instant torn from his Head his Shirt from his Back and from his Face descended five Streams of Blood denoting the Number of Claws with which Nature had unhappily armed the Enemy  Mr  Partridge  acted for some Time on the defensive only indeed he attempted only to guard his Face with his Hands but as he found that his Antagonist abated nothing of her Rage he thought she might at least endeavour to disarm her or rather to confine her Arms in doing which her Cap fell off in the Struggle and her Hair being too short to reach her Shoulders erected itself on her Head her Stays likewise which were laced through one single Hole at the Bottom burst open and her Breasts which were much more redundant than her Hair hung down below her middle her  Face was likewise marked with the Blood of her Husband her Teeth gnashed with Rage and Fire such as sparkles from a Smith's Forge darted from her Eyes So that altogether this Amazonian Heroine might have been an Object of Terror to a much bolder Man than Mr  Partridge  He had at length the good Fortune by getting Possession of her Arms to render those Weapons which she wore at the Ends of her Fingers useless which she no sooner perceived than the Softness o  her Sex prevailed over her Rage and she presently dissolved in Tears which soon after concluded i  a Fit  That small Share of Sense which Mr  Partridge  had hitherto preserved through this Scene of Fury of the Cause of which he was hitherto ignorant now utterly abandoned him He ran instantly into the Street hollowing out that his Wife was in the Agonies of Death and beseeching the Neighbours to fly with the utmost Haste to her Assistance Several good Women obeyed his Summons who entering his House and applying the usual Remedies on such Occasions Mrs  Partridge  was all length to the great Joy of her Husband brought to herself  As soon as she had a little recollected her Spirits and somewhat composed herself with a Cordial she began to inform the Company of the manifold Injuries she had received from her Husband who she said was not content to injure her in her Bed but upon her upbraiding him with it had treated her in the cruelest Manner imaginable had tore her Cap and Hair from her Head and her Stays from her Body giving her at the same Time several Blows the Marks of which she should carry to the Grave  The poor Man who bore on his Face many  ore visible Marks of the Indignaion of his Wife  od in silent Astonishment at this Accusation which the Reader will I believe bear Witness for  m had greatly exceeded the Truth for indeed he had not struck her once and this Silence being  terpreted to be a Confession of the Charge by the whole Court they all began at once  una voce  to  ebuke and revile him repeating often that none at a Coward ever struck a Woman  Mr  Partridge  bore all this patiently but when is Wife appealed to the Blood on her Face as an Evidence of his Barbarity he could not help laying  laim to his own Blood for so it really was as  e thought it very unnatural that this should rise up as we are taught that of a murdered Person often doth in Vengeance against him  To this the Women made no other Answer man that it was Pity it had not come from his Heart instead of his Face all declaring that if their Husbands should lift their Hands against them they would have their Heart's Blood out of their Bodies  After much Admonition for what was past and much good Advice to Mr  Partridge  for his future Behaviour the Company at length departed and oft the Husband and Wife to a personal Conference together in which Mr  Partridge  soon learned the Cause of all his Sufferings  CHAP V  Containing much Matter to exercise the Judgment and Reflection of the Reader  I Believe it is a true Observation that few Secrets are divulged to one Person only but certainly would be next to a Miracle that a Fact of this  Kind should be known to a whole Parish and no  transpire any farther  And indeed a very few Days had past before the Country to use a common Phrase rung of th  Schoolmaster of  Little Baddington  who was sai  to have beaten his Wife in the most cruel Manner Nay in some Places it was reported he had mur…dered her in others that he had broke her Arms in others her Legs in short there was scarce  Injury which can be done to a human Creature bu  what Mrs  Partridge  was somewhere or other affirmed to have received from her Husband  The Cause of this Quarrel was likewise variously reported for as some People said that Mrs  Par+tridge  had caught her Husband in Bed with hi  Maid so many other Reasons of a very different Kind went aboard Nay some transferred th  Guilt to the Wife and the Jealousy to the Husband  Mrs  Wilkins  had long ago heard of this Quarrel but as a different Cause from the true one had reached her Ears she thought proper to conceal it and the rather perhaps as the Blame was universally laid on Mr  Partridge  and his Wife when she was Servant to Mr  Allworthy  had in something offended Mrs  Wilkins  who was not of a very forgiving Temper  But Mrs  Wilkins  whose Eyes could see Ob+jects at a Distance and who could very well loo  forwards a few Years into Futurity had perceive a strong Likelihood of Captain  Blifil'  s being here after her Master and as she plainly discerned tha  the Captain bore no great Good will to the little Foundling she fancied it would be rendering him an agreeable Service if she could make any Dis+coveries that might lessen the Affection which Mr  Allworthy  seemed to have contracted for this Child and which gave visible Uneasiness to the Captain  who could not entirely conceal it even before  Allworthy  himself though his Wife who acted her Part much better in public frequently recommended to him her own Example of conniving at  he Folly of her Brother which she said she at  east as well perceived and as much resented as any other possibly could  Mrs  Wilkins  having therefore by Accident gotten a true Scent of the above Story though long  fter it had happened failed not to satisfy herself  horoughly of all the Particulars and then acquainted the Captain that she had at last discovered the  rue Father of the little Bastard which she was sorry she said to see her Master lose his Reputation in the Country by taking so much Notice of  The Captain chid her for the Conclusion of her Speech as an improper Assurance in judging of her Master's Actions For if his Honour or his Understanding would have suffered the Captain to make  n Alliance with Mrs  Wilkins  his Pride would by no means have admitted it And to say the Truth there is no Conduct less politic than to enter into any Confederacy with your Friend's Servants against their Master For by these Means you afterwards become the Slave of these very Servants by whom you are constantly liable to be betrayed And this Consideration perhaps it was which prevented Captain  Blifil  from being more explicite with Mrs  Wilkins  or from encouraging she Abuse which she had bestowed on  Allworthy  But though he declared no Satisfaction to Mrs  Wilkins  at this Discovery he enjoyed not a little from it in his own Mind and resolved to make the best Use of it he was able  He kept this Matter a long Time concealed within his own Breast in Hopes that Mr  Allworthy  might hear it from some other Person but Mrs  Wilkins  whether she resented the Captain's Behaviour or whether his Cunning was beyond her and she feared the Discovery might displease him never afterwards opened her Lips about the Matter  I have thought it somewhat strange upon Reflection that the Housekeeper never acquainted Mrs  Blifil  with this News as Women are more inclined to communicate all Pieces of Intelligence to their own Sex than to ours The only Way as it appears to me of solving this Difficulty is by imputing it to that Distance which was now grown between the Lady and the Housekeeper Whether this arose from a Jealousy in Mrs  Blifil  that  Wil+kins  shewed too great a Respect to the Foundling for while she was endeavouring to ruin the little Infant in order to ingratiate herself with the Captain she was every Day more and more commending i  before  Allworthy  as his Fondness for it every Day encreased This notwithstanding all the Care she took at other Times to express the direct contrary to Mrs  Blifil  perhaps offended that delicate Lady who certainly now hated Mrs  Wilkins  and though she did not or possibly could not absolutely remove her from her Place she found however the Means of making her Life very uneasy This Mrs  Wilkins  at length so resented that she very openly shewed all Manner of Respect and Fondness to little  Tommy  in Opposition to Mrs  Blifil  The Captain therefore finding the Story i  Danger of perishing he at last took an Opportunity to reveal it himself  He was one Day engaged with Mr  Allworthy  in a Discourse on Charity In which the Captain with great Learning proved to Mr  Allworthy  that the Word  Charity  in Scripture no where means Beneficence or Generosity  'The Christian Religion he said was instituted  for much nobler Purposes than to enforce a Lesson which many Heathen Philosophers had taught us long before and which though it might perhaps be called a moral Virtue favoured but little of that sublime Christianlike Disposition that vast Elevation of Thought in Purity approaching to angelic Perfection to be attained expressed and felt only by Grace Those he said came nearer to the Scripture Meaning who understood by it Candour or the forming of a benevolent Opinion of our Brethren and passing a favourable Judgment on their Actions a Virtue much higher and more extensive in its Nature than a pitiful Distribution of Alms which though we would never so much prejudice or even ruin our Families could never reach many whereas Charity in the other and truer Sense might be extended to all Mankind'  He said 'Considering who the Disciples were it would be absurd to conceive the Doctrine of Generosity or giving Alms to have been preached to them And as we could not well imagine this Doctrine should be preached by its divine Author to Men who could not practise it much less shall we think it understood so by those who can practise it and do not  'But though continued he there is I am afraid little Merit in these Benefactions there would I must confess be much Pleasure in them to a good Mind if it was not abated by one Consideration I mean that we are liable to be imposed upon and to confer our choicest Favours often on the Undeserving as you must own was your Case in your Bounty to that worthless Fellow  Partridge  For two or three such Examples must greatly lessen the inward Satisfaction which a good Man would otherwise find in Generosity nay may even make him timorous in bestowing lest he should be guilty of supporting  Vice and encouraging the Wicked a Crime of a very black Dye and for which it will by no means be a sufficient Excuse that we have not actually intended such an Encouragement unless we have used the utmost Caution in chusing the Objects of our Beneficence A Consideration which I make no Doubt hath greatly checked the Liberality of many a worthy and pious Man'  Mr  Allworthy  answered 'He could not dispute with the Captain in the  Greek  Language and therefore could say nothing as to the true Sense of the Word which is translated  Charity  but that he had always thought it was interpreted to consist in Action and that giving Alms constituted at least one Branch of that Virtue  'As to the meritorious Part he said he readily agreed with the Captain for where could be the Merit of barely discharging a Duty which he said let the Word Charity have what Construction it would it sufficiently appeared to be from the whole Tenor of the New Testament And as he thought it an indispensable Duty enjoined both by the Christian Law and by the Law of Nature itself so was it withal so pleasant that if any Duty could be said to be its own Reward or to pay us while we were discharging it it was this  'To confess the Truth said he there is one Degree of Generosity of Charity I would have called it which seems to have some Shew of Merit and that is where from a Principle of Benevolence and Christian Love we bestow on another what we really want ourselves where in order to lessen the Distresses of another we condescend to share some Part of them by giving what even our own Necessities cannot well spare This is I think meritorious but to relieve our Brethren only with our Superfluities to be charitable I must use the Word rather at the Expence of our Coffers than  ourselves to save several Families from Misery rather than hang an extraordinary Picture in our Houses or gratify any other idle ridiculous Vanity this seems to be only being Christians nay indeed only being human Creatures Nay I will venture to go farther it is being in some degree Epicures For what could the greatest Epicure wish rather than to eat with many Mouths instead of one which I think may be predicated of any one who knows that the Bread of many is owing to his own Largesses  'As to the Apprehension of bestowing Bounty on such as may hereafter prove unworthy Objects because many have proved such surely it can never deter a good Man from Generosity I do not think a few or many Examples of Ingratitude can justify a Man's hardening his Heart against the Distresses of his Fellow Creatures nor do I believe it can ever have such Effect on a truely benevolent Mind Nothing less than a Persuasion of universal Depravity can lock up the Charity of a good Man and this Persuasion must lead him I think either into Atheism or Enthusiasm but surely it is unfair to argue such universal Depravity from a few vicious Individuals nor was this I believe ever done by a Man who upon searching his own Mind found one certain Exception to the general Rule He then concluded by asking who that  Partridge  was whom he had called a worthless Fellow'  'I mean said the Captain  Partridge  the Barber the Schoolmaster what do you call him  Partridge  the Father of the little Child which you found in your Bed'  Mr  Allworthy  exprest great Surprize at this Account and the Captain as great at his Ignorance of it For he said he had known it above a Month and at length recollected with much Difficulty that he was told it by Mrs  Wilkins  Upon this  Wilkins  was immediately summoned  who having confirmed what the Captain had said was by Mr  Allworthy  by and with the Captain's Advice dispatched to  Little Baddington  to inform herself of the Truth of the Fact For the Captain exprest great Dislike to all hasty Proceedings in criminal Matters and said he would by no means have Mr  Allworthy  take any Resolution either to the Prejudice of the Child or its Father before he was satisfied that the latter was guilty For tho' he had privately satisfied himself of this from one of  Partridge'  s Neighbours yet he was too generous to give any such Evidence to Mr  Allworthy  CHAP VI  The Trial of  Partridge  the Schoolmaster for Incontinency The Evidence of his Wife A short Reflection on the Wisdom of our Law with other grave Matters which those will like best who understand them most  IT may be wondered that a Story so well known and which had furnished so much matter of Conversation should never have been mentioned to Mr  Allworthy  himself who was perhaps the only Person in that Country who had never heard of it  To account in some measure for this to the Reader I think proper to inform him that there was no one in the Kingdom less interested in opposing that Doctrine concerning the meaning of the Word Charity which hath been seen in the preceding Chapter than our good Man Indeed he was equally intitled to this Virtue in either Sense For as no Man was ever more sensible of the Wants or more ready to relieve the Distresses of others so none could be more tender of their Characters or slower to believe any thing to their Disadvantage  Scandal therefore never found any Access to his Table For it hath been long since observed that you  may know a Man by his Companions so I will venture to say that by attending to the Conversation at a great Man's Table you may satisfy yourself of his Religion his Politics his Taste and indeed of his entire Disposition For tho' a few odd Fellows will utter their own Sentiments in all Places yet much the greater Part of Mankind have enough of the Courtier to accommodate their Conversation to the Taste and Inclination of their Superiors  But to return to Mrs  Wilkins  who having executed her Commission with great Dispatch tho' at fifteen Miles Distance brought back such a Confirmation of the Schoolmaster's Guilt that Mr  Allworthy  determined to send for the Criminal and examine him  viva voce  Mr  Partridge  therefore was summoned to attend in order to his Defence if he could make any against this Accusation  At the Time appointed before Mr  Allworthy  himself at  ParadiseHall  came as well the said  Partridge  with  Anne  his Wife as Mrs  Wilkins  his Accuser  And now Mr  Allworthy  being seated in the Chair of Justice Mr  Partridge  was brought before him Having heard his Accusation from the Mouth of Mrs  Wilkins  he pleaded not guilty making many vehement Protestations of his Innocence  Mrs  Partridge  was then examined who after a modest Apology for being obliged to speak the Truth against her Husband related all the Circumstances with which the Reader hath already been acquainted and at last concluded with her Husband's Confession of his Guilt  Whether she had forgiven him or no I will not venture to determine But it is certain she was an unwilling Witness in this Cause and it is probable from certain other Reasons would never have been brought to depose as she did had not Mrs  Wilkins  with great Art fished all out of her at her own  House and had she not indeed made Promises in Mr  Allworthy'  s Name that the Punishment of her Husband should not be such as might any wise affect his Family  Partridge  still persisted in asserting his Innocence tho' he admitted he had made the above mentioned Confession which he however endeavoured to account for by protesting that he was forced into it by the continued Importunity she used who vowed that as she was sure of his Guilt she would never leave tormenting him till he owned it and faithfully promised that in such Case she would never mention it to him more Hence he said he had been induced falsely to confess himself guilty tho' he was innocent and that he believed he should have confest a Murder from the same Motive  Mrs  Partridge  could not bear this Impudence with Patience and having no other Remedy in the present Place but Tears she called forth a plentiful Assistance from them and then addressing herself to Mr  Allworthy  she said or rather cried 'May it please your Worship there never was any poor Woman so injured as I am by that base Man For this is not the only Instance of his Falshood to me No may it please your Worship he hath injured my Bed many's the good time and often I could have put up with his Drunkenness and neglect of his Business if he had not broke one of the sacred  Commandments  Besides if it had been out of Doors I had not mattered it so much but with my own Servant in my own House under my own Roof to defile my own chaste Bed which to be sure he hath with his beastly stinking Whores Yes you Villain you have defiled my own Bed you have and then you have charged me with  bullocking  you into owning the Truth It is very likely an't please your Worship that I should  bullock  himI have Marks enow about my Body to shew of his  Cruelty to me If you had been a Man you Villain you would have scorned to injure a Woman in that Manner But you an't half a Man you know itNor have you been half a Husband to me You need run after Whores you need when I'm sureAnd since he provokes me I am ready an't please your Worship to take my bodily Oath that I found them abed together What you have forgot I suppose when you beat me into a Fit and made the Blood run down my Forehead because I only civilly taxed you with your Adultery but I can prove it by all my Neighbours You have almost broke my Heart you have you have'  Here Mr  Allworthy  interrupted and begged her to be pacified promising her that she should have Justice then turning to  Partridge  who stood aghast one half of his Wits being hurried away by Surprise and the other half by Fear he said he was sorry to see there was so wicked a Man in the World He assured him that his prevaricating and lying backward and forward was a great Aggravation of his Guilt For which the only Atonement he could make was by Confession and Repentance He exhorted him therefore to begin by immediately confessing the Fact and not to persist in denying what was so plainly proved against him even by his own Wife  Here Reader I beg your Patience a Moment while I make a just Compliment to the great Wisdom and Sagacity of our Law which refuses to admit the Evidence of a Wife for or against her Husband This says a certain learned Author who I believe was never quoted before in any but a Lawbook would be the Means of creating an eternal Dissention between them It would indeed be the Means of much Perjury and of much Whipping Fining Imprisoning Transporting and Hanging  Partridge  stood a while silent till being bid to speak he said he had already spoken the Truth and appealed  to Heaven for his Innocence and lastly to the Girl herself whom he desired his Worship immediately to send for for he was ignorant or at least pretended to be so that she had left that part of the Country  Mr  Allworthy  whose natural Love of Justice joined to his Coolness of Temper made him always a most patient Magistrate in hearing all the Witnesses which an accused Person could produce in his Defence agreed to defer his final Determination of this Matter till the Arrival of  Jenny  for whom he immediately dispatched a Messenger and then having recommended Peace between  Partridge  and his Wife tho' he addressed himself chiefly to the wrong Person he appointed them to attend again the third Day For he had sent  Jenny  a whole Day's Journey from his own House  At the appointed Time the Parties all assembled when the Messenger returning brought Word that  Jenny  was not to be found for that she had left her Habitation a few Days before in company with a recruiting Officer  Mr  Allworthy  then declared that the Evidence of such a Slut as she appeared to be would have deserved no Credit but he said he could not help thinking that had she been present and would have declared the Truth she must have confirmed what so many Circumstances together with his own Confession and the Declaration of his Wife that she had caught her Husband in the Fact did sufficiently prove He therefore once more exhorted  Partridge  to confess but he still avowing his Innocence Mr  Allworthy  declared himself satisfied of his Guilt and that he was too bad a Man to receive any Encouragement from him He therefore deprived him of his Annuity and recommended Repentance to him on account of another World and Industry to maintain himself and his Wife in this  There were not perhaps many more unhappy Persons than poor  Partridge  He had lost the best Part of his Income by the Evidence of his Wife and yet was daily upbraided by her for having among other Things been the Occasion of depriving her of that Benefit but such was his Fortune and he was obliged to submit to it  Tho' I called him poor  Patridge  in the last Paragraph I would have the Reader rather impute that Epithet to the Compassion in my Temper than conceive it to be any Declaration of his Innocence Whether he was innocent or not will perhaps appear hereafter but if the HistoricMuse hath entrusted me with any Secrets I will by no means be guilty of discovering them till she shall give me leave  Here therefore the Reader must suspend his Curiosity Certain it is that whatever was the Truth of the Case there was Evidence more than sufficient to convict him before  Allworthy  indeed much less would have satisfied a Bench of Justices on an Order of Bastardy and yet notwithstanding the Positiveness of Mrs  Partridge  who would have taken the Sacrament upon the Matter there is a Possibility that the Schoolmaster was entirely innocent For tho' it appeared clear on comparing the Time when  Jenny  departed from  Little Baddington  with that of her Delivery that she had there conceived this Infant yet it by no means followed of Necessity that  Partridge  must have been its Father For to omit other Particulars there was in the same House a Lad near Eighteen between whom and  Jenny  there had subsisted sufficient Intimacy to found a reasonable Suspicion and yet so blind is Jealousy this Circumstance never once entered into the Head of the enraged Wife  Whether  Partridge  repented or not according to Mr  Allworthy'  s Advice is not so apparent Certain it is that his Wife repented heartily of the Evidence  she had given against him especially when she found Mrs  Deborah  had deceived her and refused to make any Appliation to Mr  Allworthy  on her Behalf She had however somewhat better Success with Mrs  Blifil  who was as the Reader must have perceived a much bettertempered Woman and very kindly undertook to solicit her Brother to restore the Annuity In which tho' Good nature might have some Share yet a stronger and more natural Motive will appear in the next Chapter  These Solicitations were nevertheless unsuccessful For tho' Mr  Allworthy  did not think with some late Writers that Mercy consists only in punishing Offenders yet he was as far from thinking that it is proper to this excellent Quality to pardon great Criminals wantonly without any Reason whatever Any Doubtfulness of the Fact or any Circumstance of Mitigation was never disregarded but the Petitions of an Offender or the Intercessions of others did not in the least affect him In a word he never pardoned because the offender himself or his Friends were unwilling that he should be punished  Partridge  and his Wife were therefore both obliged to submit to their Fate which was indeed severe enough For so far was he from doubling his Industry on the account of his lessened Income that he did in a manner abandon himself to despair and as he was by Nature indolent that Vice now increased upon him by which means he lost the little School he had so that neither his Wife nor himself would have had any Bread to eat had not the Charity of some good Christian interposed and provided them with what was just sufficient for their Sustenance  As this Support was conveyed to them by an unknown Hand they imagined and so I doubt not will the Reader that Mr  Allworthy  himself was their secret Benefactor who though he would not openly encourage Vice could yet privately relieve the Distresses  of the Vicious themselves when these became too exquisite and disproportionate to their Merit In which Light their Wretchedness appeared now to Fortune herself for she at length took pity on this miserable Couple and considerably lessened the wretched State of  Partridge  by putting a final end to that of his Wife who soon after caught the Smallpox and died  The Justice which Mr  Allworthy  had executed on  Partridge  at first met with universal Approbation but no sooner had he felt its Consequences than his Neighbours began to relent and to compassionate his Case and presently after to blame that as Rigour and Severity which they before called Justice They now exclaimed against punishing in cold Blood and sang forth the Praises of Mercy and Forgiveness  These Cries were considerably increased by the Death of Mrs  Partridge  which tho' owing to the Distemper above mentioned which is no Consequence of Poverty or Distress many were not ashamed to impute to Mr  Allworthy'  s Severity or as they now termed it Cruelty  Partridge  having now lost his Wife his School and his Annuity and the unknown Person having now discontinued the last mentioned Charity resolved to change the Scene and left the Country where he was in Danger of starving with the universal Compassion of all his Neighbours  CHAP VII  A short Sketch of that Felicity which prudent Couples may extract from Hatred with a short Apology for those People who overlook Imperfections in their Friends  THO' the Captain had effectually demolished poor  Partridge  yet had he not reaped the Harvest he hoped for which was to turn the Foundling out of Mr  Allworthy'  s House  On the contrary that Gentleman grew every Day fonder of little  Tommy  as if he intended to counterbalance his Severity to the Father with extraordinary Fondness and Affection towards the Son  This a good deal soured the Captain's Temper as did all the other daily Instances of Mr  Allworthy'  s Generosity For he looked on all such Largesses to be Diminutions of his own Wealth  In this we have said he did not agree with his Wife nor indeed in any thing else For tho' an Affection placed on the Understanding is by many wife Persons thought much more durable than that which is founded on Beauty yet it happened otherwise in the present Case Nay the Understandings of this Couple were their principal Bone of Contention and one great Cause of many Quarrels which from time to time arose between them and which at last ended on the Side of the Lady in a sovereign Contempt for her Husband and on the Husband's in an utter Abhorrence of his Wife  As these had both exercised their Talents chiefly in the Study of Divinity this was from their first Acquaintance the most common Topic of Conversation between them The Captain like a wellbred Man had before Marriage always given up his Opinion to that of the Lady and this not in the clumsy aukward Manner of a conceited Blockhead who' while he civilly yields to a Superiour in an Argument is desirous of being still known to think himself in the Right The Captain on the contrary tho' one of the proudest Fellows in the World so absolutely yielded the Victory to his Antagonist that she who had not the least Doubt of his Sincerity retired always from the Dispute with an Admiration of her own Understanding and a Love for his  But tho' this Complaisance to one whom the Captain thoroughly despised was not so uneasy to him as it would have been had any Hopes of Preferment  made it necessary to shew the same Submission to a  Hoadley  or to some other of great Reputation in the Science yet even this cost him too much to be endured without some Motive Matrimony therefore having removed all such Motives he grew weary of this Condescention and began to treat the Opinions of his Wife with that Haughtiness and Insolence which none but those who deserve some Contempt themselves can bestow and those only who deserve no Contempt can bear  When the first Torrent of Tenderness was over and when in the calm and long Interval between the Fits Reason began to open the Eyes of the Lady and she saw this Alteration of Behaviour in the Captain who at length answered all her Arguments only with Pish and Pshaw she was far from enduring the Indignity with a tame Submission Indeed it at first so highly provoked her that it might have produced some tragical Event had it not taken a more harmless Turn by filling her with the utmost Contempt for her Husband's Understanding which somewhat qualified her Hatred towards him tho' of this likewise she had a pretty moderate Share  The Captain's Hatred to her was of a purer Kind For as to any Imperfections in her Knowledge or Understanding he no more despised her for them than for her not being six Feet high In his Opinion of the female Sex he exceeded the Moroseness of  Aristotle  himself He looked on a Woman as on an Animal of domestic Use of somewhat higher Consideration than a Cat since her Offices were of rather more Importance but the Difference between these two was in his Estimation so small that in his Marriage contracted with Mr  Allworthy'  s Lands and Tenements it would have been pretty equal which of them he had taken into the Bargain And yet so tender was his Pride that it felt the Contempt which his Wife now began to express towards him and  this added to the Surfeit he had before taken of her Love created in him a Degree of Disgust and Abhorrence perhaps hardly to be exceeded  One Situation only of the married State is excluded from Pleasure and that is a State of Indifference but as many of my Readers I hope know what an exquisite Delight there is in conveying Pleasure to a beloved Object so some few I am afraid may have experienced the Satisfaction of tormenting one we hate It is I apprehend to come at this latter Pleasure that we see both Sexes often give up that Ease in Marriage which they might otherwise possess tho' their Mate was never so disagreeable to them Hence the Wife often puts on Fits of Love and Jealousy nay even denies herself any Pleasure to disturb and prevent those of her Husband and he again in return puts frequent Restraints on himself and stays at home in Company which he dislikes in order to confine his Wife to what she equally detests Hence too must flow those Tears which a Widow sometimes so plentifully sheds over the Ashes of a Husband with whom she led a Life of constant Disquiet and Turbulency and whom now she can never hope to torment any more  But if ever any Couple enjoyed this Pleasure it was at present experienced by the Captain and his Lady It was always a sufficient Reason to either of them to be obstinate in any Opinion that the other had previously asserted the contrary If the one proposed any Amusement the other constantly objected to it They never loved or hated commended or abused the same Person And for this Reason as the Captain looked with an evil Eye on the little Foundling his Wife began now to caress it almost equally with her own Child  The Reader will be apt to conceive that this Behaviour between the Husband and Wife did not greatly contribute to Mr  Allworthy'  s Repose as it  tended so little to that serene Happiness which he had proposed to all three from this Alliance but the Truth is though he might be a little disappointed in his sanguine Expectations yet he was far from being acquainted with the whole Matter For as the Captain was from certain obvious Reasons much on his Guard before him the Lady was obliged for fear of her Brother's Displeasure to pursue the same Conduct In fact it is possible for a third Person to be very intimate nay even to live long in the same House with a married Couple who have any tolerable Discretion and not even guess at the four Sentiments which they bear to each other For though the whole Day may be sometimes too short for Hatred as well as for Love yet the many Hours which they naturally spend together apart from all Observers supply People of tolerable Moderation with such ample Opportunity for the Enjoyment of either Passion that if they love they can support being a few Hours in Company without toying or if they hate without spitting in each others Faces  It is possible however that Mr  Allworthy  saw enough to render him a little uneasy for we are not always to conclude that a wise Man is not hurt because he doth not cry out and lament himself like those of a childish or effeminate Temper But indeed it is possible he might see some Faults in the Captain without any Uneasiness at all For Men of true Wisdom and Goodness are contented to take Persons and Things as they are without complaining of their Imperfections or attempting to amend them They can see a Fault in a Friend a Relation or an Accquaintance without ever mentioning it to the Parties themselves or any others and this often without the least lessening their Affection Indeed unless great Discernment be tempered with this overlooking Disposition we ought never to contract Friendship but with a Degree of Folly which we can  deceive For I hope my Friends will pardon me when I declare I know none of them without a Fault and I should be sorry if I could imagine I had any Friend who could not see mine Forgiveness of this Kind we give and demand in Turn It is an Exercise of Friendship and perhaps none of the least pleasant And this Forgiveness we must bestow without Desire of Amendment There is perhaps no surer Mark of Folly than an Attempt to correct the natural Infirmities of those we love The finest Composition of human Nature as well as the finest China may have a Flaw in it and this I am afraid in either Case is equally incurable though nevertheless the Pattern may remain of the highest Value  Upon the whole then Mr  Allworthy  certainly saw some Imperfections in the Captain but as this was a very artful Man and eternally upon his Guard before him these appeared to him no more than Blemishes in a good Character which his Goodness made him overlook and his Wisdom prevented him from discovering to the Captain himself Very different would have been his Sentiments had he discovered the whole which perhaps would in Time have been the Case had the Husband and Wife long continued this Kind of Behaviour to each other but this kind Fortune took effectual Means to prevent by forcing the Captain to do that which rendered him again dear to his Wife and restored all her Tenderness and Affection towards him  CHAP VIII  A Receipt to regain the lost Affections of a Wife which hath never been known to fail in the most desperate Cases  THE Captain was made large Amends for the unpleasant Minutes which he passed in the Conversation of his Wife and which were as few as he  could contrive to make them by the pleasant Meditations he enjoyed when alone  These Meditations were entirely employed on Mr  Allworthy'  s Fortune for first he exercised much Thought in calculating as well as he could the exact Value of the whole which Calculations he often saw Occasion to alter in his own Favour And secondly and chiefly he pleased himself with intended Alterations in the House and Gardens and in projecting many other Schemes as well for Improvement of the Estate as of the Grandeur of the Place For this Purpose he applied himself to the Studies of Architecture and Gardening and read over many Books on both those Subjects for these Sciences indeed employed his whole Time and formed his only amusement He at last completed a most excellent Plan and very sorry we are that it is not in our Power to present it to our Reader since even the Luxury of the present Age I believe would hardly match it It had indeed in a superlative Degree the two principal Ingredients which serve to recommend all great and noble Designs of this Nature For it required an immoderate Expence to execute and a vast Length of Time to bring it to any Sort of Perfection The former of these the immense Wealth of which the Captain supposed Mr  Allworthy  possessed and which he thought himself sure of inheriting promised very effectually to supply and the latter the Soundness of his own Constitution and his Time of Life which was only what is called Middle Age removed all Apprehension of his not living to accomplish  Nothing was wanting to enable him to enter upon the immediate Execution of this Plan but the Death of Mr  Allworthy  in calculating which he had employed much of his own Algebra besides purchasing every Book extant that treats of the Value of Lives Reversions  c  From all which he satisfied himself that as he had every Day a Chance of this happening  so had he more than an even Chance of its happening within a few Years  But while the Captain was one Day busied in deep Contemplations of this Kind one of the most unlucky as well as unseasonable Accidents happened to him The utmost Malice of Fortune could indeed have contrived nothing so cruel so malapropos so absolutely destructive to all his Schemes In short not to keep the Reader in long Suspence just at the very Instant when his Heart was exulting in Meditations o  the Happiness which would accrue to him by Mr  Allworthy'  s Death he himselfdied of an Apoplexy  This unfortunately befel the Captain as he was taking his Evening Walk by himself so that no Body was present to lend him any Assistance if indeed any Assistance could have preserved him He took therefore Measure of that Proportion of Soil which was now become adequate to all his future Purposes and he lay dead on the Ground a great though not a living Example of the Truth of that Observation of  Horace  'Tu secanda marmora  'Locas sub ipsum funus et sepulchri  'Immemor struis domos  Which Sentiment I shall thus give to the  English  Reader 'You provide the noblest Materials for Building when a Pickax and a Spade are only necessary and build Houses of five hundred by a hundred Feet forgetting that of six by two'  CHAP IX  A Proof of the Infallibility of the foregoing Receipt in the Lamentations of the Widow with other suitable Decorations of Death such as Physicians  c  and an Epitaph in the true Stile  MR  Allworthy  his Sister and another Lady were assembled at the accustomed Hour in the Supper Room where having waited a considerable  Time longer than usual Mr  Allworthy  first declared  e began to grow uneasy at the Captain's Stay for he was always most punctual at his Meals and gave Orders that the Bell should be rung without the Doors and especially towards those Walks which the Captain was wont to use  All these Summons proving ineffectual for the Captain had by perverse Accident betaken himself  a new Walk that Evening Mrs  Blifil  declared she was seriously frightned Upon which the other Lady who was one of her most intimate Acquaintance and who well knew the true State of her Affections endeavoured all she could to pacify her telling herso be sure she could not help being uneasy but that she should hope the best That perhaps the Sweetness of the Evening had enticed the Captain to go farther than his usual Walk or he might be detained at some Neighbour's Mrs  Blifil  answered No she was are some Accident had befallen him for that he would never stay out without sending her Word as  e must know how uneasy it would make her The other Lady having no other Arguments to use betook herself to the Entreaties usual on such Occasions and begged her not to frighten herself for it might be of very ill Consequence to her own Health and filling out a very large Glass of Wine advised and at last prevailed with her to drink it  Mr  Allworthy  now returned into the Parlour for he had been himself in Search after the Captain His Countenance sufficiently shewed the Consternation he was under which indeed had a good deal deprived him of Speech but as Grief operates variously on different  linds so the same Apprehension which depressed his Voice elevated that of Mrs  Blifil  She now began to bewail herself in very bitter Terms and Floods of Tears accompanied her Lamentations which the Lady her Companion declared she could not blame  ut at the same Time dissuaded her from indulging  attempting to moderate the Grief of her Friend by philosophical Observations on the many Disappoint+ments to which human Life is daily subject which she said was a sufficient Consideration to fortify on Minds against any Accidents how sudden or terrible soever She said her Brother's Example ought to teach her Patience who though indeed he could not be supposed as much concerned as herself yet was doubtless very uneasy though his Resignation to the Di+vine Will had restrained his Grief within due Bounds 'Mention not my Brother' said Mrs  Blifil  'alone am the Object of your Pity What are the Terrors of Friendship to what a Wife feels on these Occasions O he is lost Somebody hath murder+ed himI shall never see him more'Here Torrent of Tears had the same Consequence with what the Suppression had occasioned to Mr  Allworthy  and she remained silent  At this Interval a Servant came running in ou  of Breath and cried out the Captain was found and before he could proceed farther he was follow+ed by two more bearing the dead Body between them  Here the curious Reader may observe another Diversity in the Operations of Grief For as Mr  All+worthy  had been before silent from the same Cause which had made his Sister vociferous so did the present Sight which drew Tears from the Gentleman put an entire Stop to those of the Lady who first gave a violent Scream and presently after fell into a Fit  The Room was soon full of Servants some of whom with the Lady visitant were employed in Care of the Wife and others with Mr  Allworthy  assisted in carrying off the Captain to a warm Bed where every Method was tried in order to restore him to Life  And glad should we be could we inform the Reader at both these Bodies had been attended with equal  ccess for those who undertook the Care of the  dy succeeded so well that after the Fit had con  ued a decent Time she again revived to their great  atisfaction but as to the Captain all Experiments bleeding chafing dropping  c  proved ineffc  l Death that inexorable Judge had passed Sen  ce on him and refused to grant him a Reprieve  ugh two Doctors who arrived and were fee'd at  e and the same Instant were his Council  These two Doctors whom to avoid any malicious  pplications we shall distinguish by the Names of Dr  and Dr  Z  having felt his Pulse to wit Dr  Y  s right Arm and Dr  Z  his left both agreed that he  as absolutely dead but as to the Distemper or Cause  his Death they differed D  Y  holding that he  d died of an Apoplexy and Dr  Z  of an Epilepsy Hence arose a Dispute between the learned Men which each delivered the Reasons of their several Opinions These were of such equal Force that they served  th to confirm either Doctor in his own Sentiments and made not the least Impression on his Adversary To say the Truth every Physician almost hath  s favourite Disease to which he ascribes all the Vic  ies obtained over human Nature The Gout the  eumatism the Stone the Gravel and the Consump  n have all their several Patrons in the Faculty and one more than the nervous Fever or the Fever on the  pirits And here we may account for those Disagree  ents in Opinion concerning the Cause of a Pati  t's Death which sometimes occur between the  ost learned of the College and which have greatly  rprized that Part of the World who have been ignorant of the Fact we have above asserted  The Reader may perhaps be surprized that in  ad of endeavouring to revive the Patient the learned  entlemen should fall immediately into a Dispute on  the Occassion of his Death but in reality all such Experiments had been made before their Arrival Fo  the Captain was put into a warm Bed had his Vei  scarified his Forehead chafed and all Sorts of stro  Drops applied to his Lips and his Nostrils  The Physicians therefore finding themselves anticipated in every thing they ordered were at a Los  how to employ that Portion of Time which it is use sual and decent to remain for their Fee and wer  necessitated to find some Subject or other for Discourse and what could more naturally present itself than that beforementioned  Our Doctors were about to take their Leave when Mr  Allworthy  having given over the Captain and acquiesced in the divine Will began to enquir  after his Sister whom he desired them to visit before their departure  This Lady was now recovered of her Fit and to use the common Phrase as well as could be expected for one in her Condition The Doctors therefore all previous Ceremonies being complied with as this was a new Patient attended according to desire and laid hold on each of her Hands as they had before done on those of the Corpse  The Case of the Lady was in the other Extreme from that of her Husband for as he was past all the Assistance of Physic so in reality she required none  There is nothing more unjust than the Vulgar Opinion by which Physicians are misrepresented a  Friends to Death On the contrary I believe i  the Number of those who recover by Physic could be opposed to that of the Martyrs to it the former would rather exceed the latter Nay some are so cautious on this Head that to avoid a Possibility of killing the Patient they abstain from all Methods of curing and prescribe nothing but what can neither do good nor harm I have heard some  of these with great Gravity deliver it as a Maxim  hat Nature should be left to do her own Work while the Physician stands by as it were to clap her  n the Back and encourage her when she doth well  So little then did our Doctors delight in Death  at they discharged the Corpse after a single Fee  ut they were not so disgusted with their living Pati  t concerning whose Case they immediately a  reed and fell to prescribing with great Diligence  Whether as the Lady had at first persuaded her Phy  cians to believe her ill they had now in return per  aded her to believe herself so I will not determine  ut she continued a whole Month with all the Deco  tions of Sickness During this Time she was vi  ted by Physicians attended by Nurses and received  onstant Messages from her Acquaintance to enquire after her Health  At length the decent Time for Sickness and immoderate Grief being expired the Doctors were discharged and the Lady began to see Company being  tered only from what she was before by that Colour of Sadness in which she had dressed her Person and Countenance  The Captain was now interred and might perhaps have already made a large Progress towards Oblivion had not the Friendship of Mr  Allworthy  aken Care to preserve his Memory by the following Epitaph which was written by a Man of as great Genius as Integrity and one who perfectly knew the Captain  Here lies In Expectation of a joyful Rising The Body of Captain JOHN BLIFIL LONDON had the Honour of his Birth OXFORD of his Education His Parts were an Honour to his Profession and to his Country His Life to his Religion and human Nature He was a dutiful Son a tender Husband an affectionate Father a sincere Friend a devout Christian and a good Man His inconsolable Widow hath erected this Stone The Monument of His Virtues and of Her Affection  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK III  Containing the most memorable Transactions which passed in the Family of Mr  Allworthy  from the Time when  Tommy Jones  arrived at the Age of Fourteen till he attained the Age of Seventeen In this Book the Reader may pick up some Hints concerning the Education of Children  CHAP I  Containing little or nothing  THE Reader will be well pleased to remember that at the Beginning of the Second Book of this History we gave him a Hint of our Intention to pass over several large Periods of Time in which nothing happened worthy of being recorded in a Chronicle of this Kind  In so doing we do not only consult our own Dignity and Ease but the Good and Advantage of the Reader For besides that by these Means we prevent him from throwing away his Time in reading without either Pleasure or Emolument we gave him at  all such Seasons an Opportunity of employing that wonderful Sagacity of which he is Master by filling up these vacant Spaces of Time with his own Conjectures for which Purpose we have taken care to qualify him in the preceding Pages  For Instance what Reader but knows that Mr  Allworthy  felt at first for the Loss of his Friend those Emotions of Grief which on such Occasions enter into all Men whose Hearts are not composed of Flint or their Heads of as solid Materials Again what Reader doth not know that Philosophy and Religion in time moderated and at last extinguished this Grief The former of these teaching the Folly and Vanity of it and the latter correcting it as unlawful and at the same time assuaging it by raising future Hopes and Assurances which enable a strong and religious Mind to take leave of a Friend on his Deathbed with little less indifference than if he was preparing for a long Journey and indeed with little less Hope of seeing him again  Nor can the judicious Reader be at a greater Loss on Account of Mrs  Bridget Blifil  who he may be assured conducted herself through the whole Season in which Grief is to make its Appearance on the outside of the Body with the strictest Regard to all the Rules of Custom and Decency suiting the Alterations of her Countenance to the several Alterations of her Habit For as this changed from Weeds to Black from Black to Grey from Grey to White so did her Countenance change from Dismal to Sorrowful from Sorrowful to Sad and from Sad to Serious till the Day came in which she was allowed to return to her former Serenity  We have mentioned these two as Examples only of the Task which may be imposed on Readers of the lowest Class Much higher and harder Exercises of Judgment and Penetration may reasonably be expected from the upper Graduates in Criticism Maby  notable Discoveries will I doubt not be made by such of the Transactions which happened in the Family of our worthy Man during all the Years which we have thought proper to pass over For tho' nothing worthy of a Place in this History occurred within that Period yet did several Incidents happen of equal Importance with those reported by the daily and Weekly Historians of the Age in reading which great Numbers of Persons consume a considerable Part of their Time very little I am afraid to their Emolument Now in the Conjectures here proposed some of the most excellent Faculties of the Mind may be employed to much Advantage since it is a more useful Capacity to be able to foretel the Actions of Men in any Circumstance from their Characters than to judge of their Characters from their Actions The former I own requires the greater Penetration but may be accomplished by true Sagacity with no less certainty than the latter  As we are sensible that much the greatest Part of our Readers are very eminently possessed of this Quality we have left them a Space of twelve Years to exert it in and shall now bring forth our Hero at about fourteen Years of Age not questioning that many have been long impatient to be introduced to his Acquaintance  CHAP II  The Hero of this great History appears with very bad Omens A little Tale of so  LOW  a Kind that some may think it not worth their Notice A Word or two concerning a Squire and more relating to a Gamekeeper and a Schoolmaster  AS we determined when we first sat down to write this History to flatter no Man but to guide our Pen throughout by the Directions of Truth we are obliged to bring our Hero on the Stage in a much more disadvantageous Manner than we could wish  and to declare honestly even at his first Appearance that it was the universal Opinion of all Mr  Allworthy'  s Family that he was certainly born to be hanged  Indeed I am sorry to say there was too much Reason for this Conjecture The Lad having from his earliest Years discovered a Propensity to many Vices and especially to one which hath as direct a Tendency as any other to that Fate which we have just now observed to have been prophetically denounced against him He had been already convicted of three Robberies  viz  of robbing an Orchard of stealing a Duck out of a Farmer's Yard and of picking Master  Blifil'  s Pocket of a Ball  The Vices of this young Man were moreover heightened by the disadvantageous Light in which they appeared when opposed to the Virtues of Master  Blifil  his Companion A Youth of so different a Cast from little  Jones  that not only the Family but all the Neighbourhood resounded his Praises He was indeed a Lad of a remarkable Disposition sober discreet and pious beyond his Age Qualities which gained him the Love of every one who knew him while  Tom Jones  was universally disliked and many expressed their Wonder that Mr  Allworthy  would suffer such a Lad to be educated with his Nephew lest the Morals of the latter should be corrupted by his Example  An Incident which happened about this Time will set the Characters of these two Lads more fairly before the discerning Reader than is in the Power of the longest Dissertation  Tom Jones  who bad as he is must serve for the Heroe of this History had only one Friend among all the Servants of the Family for as to Mrs  Wilkins  she had long since given him up and was perfectly reconciled to her Mistress This Friend was the Gamekeeper a Fellow of a loose kind of Disposition and who was thought not to entertain much strict  Notions concerning the Difference of  meum  and  tuum  than the young Gentleman himself And hence this Friendship gave Occasion to many sarcastical Remarks among the Domestics most of which were either Proverbs before or at least are become so now and indeed the Wit of them all may be comprised in that short  I atin  Proverb  "Noscitur a socio"  which I think is thus expressed in  English  "You may know him by the Company he keeps"  To say the Truth some of that atrocious Wickedness in  Jones  of which we have just mentioned three Examples might perhaps be derived from the Encouragement he had received from this Fellow who in two or three Instances had been what the Law calls an Accessary after the Fact For the whole Duck and great Part of the Apples were converted to the Use of the Gamekeeper and his Family Tho' as  Jones  alone was discovered the poor Lad bore not only the whole Smart but the whole Blame both which fell again to his Lot on the following Occasion Contiguous to Mr  Allworthy'  s Estate was the Manor of one of those Gentlemen who are called  Preservers of the Game  This Species of Men from the great Severity with which they revenge the Death of a Hare or a Partridge might be thought to cultivate the same Superstition with the Bannians in  India  many of whom we are told dedicate their whole Lives to the Preservation and Protection of certain Animals was it not that our  English  Bannians while they preserve them from other Enemies will most unmercifully slaughter whole Horseloads themselves so that they stand clearly acquitted of any such heathenish Superstition  I have indeed a much better Opinion of this Kind of Men than is entertained by some as I take them to answer the Order of Nature and the good Purposes for which they were ordained in a more ample  Manner than many others Now as  Horace  tells us that there are a set of human Beings  'Fruges consumere nati  'Born to consume the Fruits of the Earth' So I make no manner of Doubt but that there are others  'Feras consumere nati  'Born to consume the Beasts of the Field' or as it is commonly called the Game and none I believe will deny but that those Squires fulfil this End of their Creation  Little  Jones  went one Day a shooting with the Gamekeeper when happening to spring a Covey of Partridges near the Border of that Manor over which Fortune to fulfil the wise Purposes of Nature had planted one of the GameConsumers the Birds flew into it and were  marked  as it is called by the two Sportsmen in some Furze Bushes about two or three hundred Paces beyond Mr  Allworthy'  s Dominions  Mr  Allworthy  had given the Fellow strict Orders on Pain of forfeiting his Place never to trespass on any of his Neighbours no more on those who were less rigid in this Matter than on the Lord of this Manor With regard to others indeed these Orders had not been always very scrupulously kept but as the Disposition of the Gentleman with whom the Partridges had taken sauctuary was well known the Gamekeeper had never yet attempted to invade his Territories Nor had he done it now had not the younger Sportsman who was so excessively eager to pursue the flying Game overpersuaded him but  Jones  being very importunate the other who was himself keen enough after the Sport yielded to his Persuasions entered the Manor and shot one of the Partridges  The Gentleman himself was at that time on horseback at a little Distance from them and hearing the Gun go off he immediately made towards the Place  and discovered poor  Tom  For the Gamekeeper had leapt into the thickest Part of the Furzebrake where he had happily concealed himself  The Gentleman having searched the Lad and found the Partridge upon him denounced great Vengeance swearing he would acquaint Mr  Allworthy  He was as good as his Word for he rode immediately to his House and complained of the Trespass on his Manor in as high Terms and as bitter Language as if his House had been broken open and the most valuable Furniture stole out of it He added that some other Person was in his Company tho' he could not discover him for that two Guns had been discharged almost in the same Instant And says he 'we have found only this Partridge but the Lord knows what Mischief they have done'  At his Return home  Tom  was presently convened before Mr  Allworthy  He owned the Fact and alledged no other Excuse but what was really true  viz  that the Covey was originally sprung in Mr  Allworthy'  s own Manor  Tom  was then interrogated who was with him which Mr  Allworthy  declared he was resolved to know acquainting the Culprit with the Circumstance of the two Guns which had been deposed by the Squire and both his Servants but  Tom  stoutly persisted in asserting that he was alone yet to say the Truth he hesitated a little at first which would have confirmed Mr  Allworthy'  s Belief had what the Squire and his Servants said wanted any further Confirmation  The Gamekeeper being a suspected Person was now sent for and the Question put to him but he relying on the Promise which  Tom  had made him to take all upon himself very resolutely denied being in Company with the young Gentleman or indeed having seen him the whole Afternoon  Mr  Allworthy  then turned towards  Tom  with more than usual Anger in his Countenance and advised  him to confess who was with him repeating that he was resolved to know The Lad however still maintained his Resolution and was dismissed with much Wrath by Mr  Allworthy  who told him he should have to the next Morning to consider of it when he should be questioned by another Person and in another Manner  Poor  Jones  spent a very melancholy Night and the more so as he was without his usual Companion for Master  Blifil  was gone abroad on a visit with his Mother Fear of the Punishment he was to suffer was on this Occasion his least Evil his chief Anxiety being lest his Constancy should fail him and he should be brought to betray the Gamekeeper whose Ruin he knew must now be the Consequence  Nor did the Gamekeeper pass his Time much better He had the same Apprehensions with the Youth for whose Honour he had likewise a much tenderer Regard than for his Skin  In the Morning when  Tom  attended the Reverend Mr  Thwackum  the Person to whom Mr  Allworthy  had committed the Instruction of the two Boys he had the same Questions put to him by that Gentleman which he had been asked the Evening before to which he returned the same Answers The Consequence of this was so severe a Whipping that it possibly fell little short of the Torture with which Confessions are in some Countries extorted from Criminals  Tom  bore his Punishment with great Resolution and tho' his Master asked him between every Stroke whether he would not confess he was contented to be flead rather than betray his Friend or break the Promise he had made  The Gamekeeper was now relieved from his Anxiety and Mr  Allworthy  himself began to be concerned at  Tom'  s Sufferings For besides that Mr  Thwackum  being highly enraged that he was not able to make the Boy say what he himself pleased had carried  his Severity much beyond the good Man's Intention this latter began now to suspect that the Squire had been mistaken which his Extreme Eagerness and Anger seemed to make probable and as for what the Servants had said in Confirmation of their Master's Account he laid no great Stress upon that Now as Cruelty and Injustice were two Ideas of which Mr  Allworthy  could by no Means support the Consciousness a single Moment he sent for  Tom  and after many kind and Friendly Exhortations said 'I am convinced my dear Child that my Suspicions have wronged you I am sorry that you have been so severely punished on this Account'And at last gave him a little Horse to make him amends again repeating his Sorrow for what had past  Tom'  s Guilt now flew in his Face more than any Severity could make it He could more easily bear the Lashes of  Thwackum  than the Generosity of  Allworthy  The Tears burst from his Eyes and he fell upon his Knees crying 'Oh Sir you are too good to me Indeed you are Indeed I don't deserve it' And at that very Instant from the Fullness of his Heart had almost betrayed the Secret but the good Genius of the Gamekeeper suggested to him what might be the Consequence to the poor Fellow and this Consideration sealed his Lips  Thwackum  did all he could to dissuade  Allworthy  from shewing any Compassion or Kindness to the Boy saying 'He had persisted in an Untruth' and gave some Hints that a second Whipping might probably bring the Matter to Light  But Mr  Allworthy  absolutely refused to consent to the Experiment He said the Boy had suffered enough already for concealing the Truth even if he was guilty seeing that he could have no Motive but a mistaken Point of Honour for so doing  Honour cry'd  Thwackum  with some Warmth mere Stubborness and Obstinacy Can Honour teach  any one to tell a Lie or can any Honour exist independent of Religion  This Discourse happened at Table when Dinner was just ended and there were present Mr  Allworthy  Mr  Thwackum  and a third Gentleman who entered into the Debate and whom before we proceed any farther we shall briefly introduce to our Reader's Acquaintance  CHAP III  The Character of Mr  Square  the Philosopher and of Mr  Thwackum  the Divine with a Dispute concerning  THE Name of this Gentleman who had then resided some time at Mr  Allworthy'  s House was Mr  Square  His natural Parts were not of the first Rate but he had greatly improved them by a learn Education He was deeply read in the Antients and a profest Master of all the Works of  Plato  and  Aristotle  Upon which great Models he had principally form'd himself sometimes according with the Opinion of the one and sometimes with that of the other In Morals he was a profest  Platonist  and in Religion he inclined to be an  Aristotelian  But tho' he had as we have said formed his Morals on the  Platonic  Model yet he perfectly agreed with the Opinion of  Aristotle  in considering that great Man rather in the Quality of a Philosopher or a Speculatist than as a Legislator This Sentiment he carried a great way indeed so far as to regard all Virtue as Matter of Theory only This it is true he never affirmed as I have heard to any one and yet upon the least attention to his Conduct I cannot help thinking it was his real Opinion as it will perfectly reconcile some Contradictions which might otherwise appear in his Character  This Gentleman and Mr  Thwackum  scarce ever met without a Disputation for their Tenets were indeed diametrically opposite to each other  Square  held human Nature to be the Perfection of all Virtue and that Vice was a Deviation from our Nature in the same Manner as Deformity of Body is  Thwackum  on the contrary maintained that the human Mind since the fall was nothing but a Sink of Iniquity till purified and redeemed by Grace In one Point only they agreed which was in all their Discourses on Morality never to mention the Word  Goodness  The favourite Phrase of the former was  the natural Beauty of Virtue  that of the latter was the  divine Power of Grace  The former measured all Actions by the  unalterable Rule of Right  and the  eternal Fitness of Things  the latter decided all Matters by Authority but in doing this he always used the Scriptures and their Commentators as the Lawyer doth his  Coke upon Lyttleton  where the Comment is of equal Authority with the Text  After this short Introduction the Reader will be pleased to remember that the Parson had concluded his Speech with a triumphant Question to which he had apprehended no Answer  viz  Can any Honour exist independent on Religion  To this  Square  answered that it was impossible to discourse philosophically concerning Words till their Meaning was first established that there were scarce any two Words of a more vague and incertain Signification than the two he had mentioned For that there were almost as many different Opinions concerning Honour as concerning Religion 'But says he if by Honour you mean the true natural Beauty of Virtue I will maintain it may exist independent of any Religion whatever Nay added he you yourself will allow it may exist independent of all but one so will a  Mahometan  a  Jew  and all the Maintainers of all the different Sects in the World'  Thwackum  replied This was arguing with the usual Malice of all the Enemies to the true Church He said he doubted not but that all the Infidels and Hereticks in the World would if they could confine Honour to their own absurd Errors and damnable Deceptions 'But Honour says he is not therefore manifold because there are many absurd Opinions about it nor is Religion manifold because there are various Sects and Heresies in the World When I mention Religion I mean the Christian Religion and not only the Christian Religion but the Protestant Religion and not only the Protestant Religion but the Church of  England  And when I mention Honour I mean that Mode of divine Grace which is not only consistent with but dependent upon this Religion and is consistent with and dependent upon no other Now to say that the Honour I here mean and which was I thought all the Honour I could be supposed to mean will uphold much less dictate an Untruth is to assert an Absurdity too shocking to be conceived'  'I purposely avoided' says  Square  'drawing a Conclusion which I thought evident from what I have said but if you perceived it I am sure you have not attempted to answer it However to drop the Article of Religion I think it is plain from what you have said that we have different Ideas of Honour or why do we not agree in the same Terms of its Explanation I have asserted that true Honour and true Virtue are almost synonimous Terms and they are both founded on the unalterable Rule of Right and the eternal Fitness of Things to which an Untruth being absolutely repugnant and contrary it is certain that true Honour cannot support an Untruth In this therefore I think we are agreed but that this Honour can be said to be founded on Religion to which it is antecedent if by Religion be meant any positive Law  'I agree' answered  Thwackum  with great 'Warmth 'with a Man who asserts Honour to be antecedent to ReligionMr  Allworthy  did I agree  He was proceeding when Mr  Allworthy  interposed telling them very coldly they had both mistaken his Meaning for that he had said nothing of true HonourIt is possible however he would not have easily quieted the Disputants who were growing equally warm had not another Matter now fallen out which put a final End to the Conversation at present  CHAP IV  Containing a necessary Apology for the Author and a childish Incident which perhaps requires an Apology likewise  BEFORE I proceed farther I shall beg leave to obviate some Misconstructions into which the Zeal of some few Readers may lead them for I would not willingly give Offence to any especially to Men who are warm in the Cause of Virtue or Religion  I hope therefore no Man will by the grossest Misunderstanding or Perversion of my Meaning misrepresent me as endeavouring to cast any Ridicule on the greatest Perfections of Human Nature and which do indeed alone purify and ennoble the Heart of Man and raise him above the Brute Creation This Reader I will venture to say and by how much the better Man you are yourself by so much the more will you be inclined to believe me that I would rather have buried the Sentiments of these two Persons in eternal Oblivion than have done any Injury to either of these glorious Causes  On the contrary it is with a View to their Service that I have taken upon me to record the Lives and Actions of two of their false and pretended Champions  A treacherous Friend is the most dangerous Enemy and I will say boldly that both Religion and Virtue have received more real Discredit from Hypocrites than the wittiest Profligates or Infidels could ever cast upon them Nay farther as these two in their Purity are rightly called the Bands of civil Society and are indeed the greatest of Blessings so when poisoned and corrupted with Fraud Pretence and Affection they have become the worst of civil Curses and have enabled Men to perpetrate the most cruel Mischiefs to their own Species  Indeed I doubt not but this Ridicule will in general be allowed my chief Apprehensions is as many true and just Sentiments often came from the Mouths of these Persons lest the whole should be taken together and I should be conceived to ridicule all alike Now the Reader will be pleased to consider that as neither of these Men were Fools they could not be supposed to have holden none but wrong Principles and to have uttered nothing but Absurdities what Injustice therefore must I have done to their Characters had I selected only what was bad and how horridly wretched and maimed must their Arguments have appeared  Upon the whole it is not Religion or Virtue but the Want of them which is here exposed Had not  Thwackum  too much neglected Virtue and  Square  Religion in the Composition of their several Systems and had not both utterly discarded all natural Goodness of Heart they had never been represented as the Objects of Derision in this History in which we will now proceed  This Matter then which put an end to the Debate mentioned in the last Chapter was no other than a Quarrel between Master  Blifil  and  Tom Jones  the Consequence of which had been a Bloody Nose to the former for though Master  Blifil  notwithstanding he was the younger was in Size above the other's  Match yet  Tom  was much his Superior at the noble Art of Boxing  Tom  however cautiously avoided all Engagements with that Youth For besides that  Tommy Jones  was an inoffensive Lad amidst all his Roguery and really loved  Blifil  Mr  Thwackum  being always the Second of the latter would have been sufficient to deter him  But well says a certain Author No Man is wise at all Hours it is therefore no Wonder that a Boy is not so A Difference arising at Play between the two Lads Master  Blifil  called  Tom  a  Beggarly Bastard  Upon which the lattter who was somewhat passionate in his Disposition immediately caused that Phaenomenon in the Face of the former which we have above remembered  Master  Blifil  now with his Blood running from his Nose and the Tears galloping after from his Eyes appeared before his Uncle and the tremendous  Thwackum  In which Court an Indictment of Assault Batterry and wounding was instantly preserred against  Tom  who in his Excuse only pleaded the Provocation which was indeed all the Matter that Master  Blifil  had omitted  It is indeed possible that this Circumstances might have escaped his Memory for in his Reply he positively insisted that he made Use of no such Appellation adding 'Heaven forbid such naughty Words should ever come out of his Mouth'  Tom  though against all Form of Law rejoined in Affirmance of the Words Upon which Master  Blifil  said 'It is no Wonder Those who will tell one Fib will hardly stick at another If I had told my Master such a wicked Fib as you have done I should be ashamed to shew my Face'  'What Fib Child' cries  Thwackum  pretty eagerly  'Why he told you that Nobody was with him a  shooting when he killed the Partridge but he knows here he burst into a Flood of Tears yes he knows for he confessed it to me that  Black Jack  the Gamekeeper was there Nay he saidYes you diddeny it if you can That you would not have confest the Truth though Master had cut you to Pieces'  At this the Fire flashed from  Thwackum'  s Eyes and he cried out in Triumph 'Oh ho This is your mistaken Notion of Honour This is the Boy who was not to be whipped again' But Mr  Allworthy  with a more gentle Aspect turned towards the Lad and said 'Is this true Child How came you to persist so obstinately in a Falshood'  Tom  said 'He scorned a Lie as much as any one but he thought his Honour engaged him to act as he did for he had promised the poor Fellow to conceal him which' he said 'he thought himself farther obliged to as the Gamekeeper had begged him not to go into the Gentleman's Manor and had at last gone himself in Compliance with his Persuasions' He said this was the whole Truth of the Matter and he would take his Oath of it and concluded with very passionately begging Mr  Allworthy  'to have Compassion on the poor Fellow's Family especially as he himself had been only guilty and the other had been very difficultly prevailed on to what he did' 'Indeed Sir' said he 'it could hardly be called a Lie that I told for the poor Fellow was entirely innocent of the whole Matter I should have gone alone after the Birds nay I did go at first and he only followed me to prevent more Mischief Do pray Sir let me be punished take my little Horse away again but pray Sir forgive poor  George  '  Mr  Allworthy  hesitated a few Moments and then dismissed the Boys advising them to live more friendly and peaceably together  CHAP V  The Opinion of the Divine and the Philosopher concerning the two Boys with some Reasons for their Opinions and other Matters  IT is probable that by disclosing this Secret which had been communicated in the utmost Confidence to him young  Blifil  preserved his Companion from a good Lashing For the Offence of the bloody Nose would have been of itself sufficient Cause for  Thwackum  to have proceeded to Correction but now this was totally absorbed in the Consideration of the other Matter and with Regard to this Mr  Allworthy  declared privately he thought the Boy deserved Reward rather than Punishment so that  Thwackum'  s Hand was withheld by a general Pardon  Thwackum  whose Meditations were full of Birch exclaimed against this weak and as he said he would venture to call it wicked Lenity To remit the Punishment of such Crimes was he said to encourage them He enlarged much on the Correction of Children and quoted many Texts from  Solomon  and others which being to be found in so many other Books shall not be found here He then applied himself to the Vice of Lying on which Head he was altogether as learned as he had been on the other  Square  said he had been endeavouring to reconcile the Behaviour of  Tom  with his Idea of perfect Virtue but could not He owned there was something which at first Sight appeared like Fortitude in the Action but as Fortitude was a Virtue and Falshood a Vice they could by no means agree or unite together He added that as this was in some measure to confound Virtue and Vice it might be worth Mr  Thwackum'  s Considerations whether a larger Castigation might not be laid on upon that Account  As both these learned Men concurred in censuring  Jones  so were they no less unanimous in applauding Master  Blifil  To bring Truth to light was by the Parson asserted to be the Duty of every religious Man and by the Philosopher this was declared to be highly conformable with the Rule of Right and the eternal and unalterable Fitness of Things  All this however weighed very little with Mr  Allworthy  He could not be prevailed on to sign the Warrant for the Execution of  Jones  There was something within his own Breast with which the invincible Fidelity which that Youth had preserved corresponded much better than it had done with the Religion of  Thwackum  or with the Virtue of  Square  He therefore strictly ordered the former of these Gentlemen to abstain from laying violent Hands on  Tom  for what had past The Pedagogue was obliged to obey those Orders but not without great Reluctance and frequent Mutterings that the Boy would be certainly spoiled  Towards the Gamekeeper the good Man behaved with more Severity He presently summoned that poor Fellow before him and after many bitter Remonstrances paid him his Wages and dismist him from his Service for Mr  Allworthy  rightly observed that there was great Difference between being guilty of a Falsehood to excuse yourself and to excuse another He likewise urged as the principal Motive to his inflexible Severity against this Man that he had basely suffered  Tom Jones  to undergo so heavy a Punishment for his Sake whereas he ought to have prevented it by making the Discovery himself  When this Story became public many people differed from  Square  and  Thwackum  in judging the Conduct of the two Lads on the Occasion Master  Blifil  was generally called a sneaking Rascal a poorspirited Wretch with other Epithets of the like Kind whilst  Tom  was honoured with the Appellations of a  brave Lad a Jolly Dog and an honest Fellow Indeed his Behaviour to  Black George  much ingratiated him with all the Servants for though that Fellow was before universally disliked yet he was no sooner turned away than he was as universally pitied and the Friendship and Gallantry of  Tom Jones  was celebrated by them all with the highest Applause and they condemned Master  Blifil  as openly as they durst without incurring the Danger of offending his Mother For all this however poor  Tom  smarted in the Flesh for though  Thwackum  had been inhibited to exercise his Arm on the foregoing Account yet as the Proverb says  It is easy to find a Stick  c So was it easy to find a Rod and indeed the not being able to find one was the only thing which could have kept  Thwackum  any long Time from chastising poor  Jones  Had the bare Delight in the Sport been the only Inducement to the Pedagogue it is probable Master  Blifil  would likewise have had his Share but though Mr  Allworthy  had given him frequent Orders to make no Difference between the Lads yet was  Thwackum  altogether as kind and gentle to this Youth as he was harsh nay even barbarous to the other To say the Truth  Blifil  had greatly gained his Master's Affections partly by the profound Respect he always shewed his Person but much more by the decent Reverence with which he received his Doctrine for he had got by Heart and frequently repeated his Phrases and maintained all his Master's religious Principles with a Zeal which was surprising in one so young and which greatly endeared him to the worthy Preceptor  Tom Jones  on the other hand was not only deficient in outward Tokens of Respect often forgetting to pull off his Hat or to bow at his Master's Approach but was altogether as unmindful both of his Master's Precepts and Example He was indeed  a thoughtless giddy Youth with little Sobriety in his Manners and less in his Countenance and would often very impudently and indecently laugh at his Companion for his serious Behaviour  Mr  Square  had the same Reason for his Preference of the former Lad for  Tom Jones  shewed no more Regard to the learned Discourses which this Gentleman would sometimes throw away upon him than to those of  Thwackum  He once ventured to make a Jest of the Rule of Right and at another Time said He believed there was no Rule in the World capable of making such a Man as his Father for so Mr  Allworthy  suffered himself to be called  Master  Blifil  on the contrary had Address enough at sixteen to recommend himself at one and the same Time to both these Opposites With one he was all Religion with the other he was all Virtue And when both were present he was profoundly silent which both interpreted in his Favour and their own  Nor was  Blifil  contented with flattering both these Gentlemen to their Faces he took frequent Occasions of praising them behind their Backs to  Allworthy  before whom when they were alone together and when his Uncle commended any religious or virtuous Sentiment for many such came constantly from him he seldom failed to ascribe it to the good Instructions he had received from either  Thwackum  or  Square  For he knew his Uncle repeated all such Compliments to the Persons for whose Use they were meant and he found by Experience the great Impressions which they made on the Philosopher as well as on the Divine For to say the Truth there is no kind of Flattery so irresistible as this at second Hand  The young Gentleman moreover soon perceived how extremely grateful all those Panegyricks on his Instructors were to Mr  Allworthy  himself as they so loudly resounded the Praise of that singular Plan of  Education which he had laid down For this worthy Man having observed the imperfect Institution of our public Schools and the many Vices which Boys were there liable to learn had resolved to educate his Nephew as well as the other Lad whom he had in a Manner adopted in his own House where he thought their Morals would escape all that Danger of being corrupted to which they would be unavoidably exposed in any public School or University  Having therefore determined to commit these Boys to the Tuition of a private Tutor Mr  Thwackum  was recommended to him for that Office by a very particular Friend of whose Understanding Mr  Allworthy  had a great Opinion and in whose Integrity he placed much Confidence This  Thwackum  was Fellow of a College where he almost entirely resided and had a great Ruputation for Learning Religion and Sobriety of Manners And these were doubtless the Qualifications by which Mr  Allworthy'  s Friend had been induced to recommend him tho' indeed this Friend had some Obligations to  Thwackum'  s Family who were the most considerable Persons in a Borough which that Gentleman represented in Parliament  Thwackum  at his first Arrival was extremely agreeable to  Allworthy  and indeed he perfectly answered the Character which had been given of him Upon longer Acquaintance however and more intimate Conversation this worthy Man saw Infirmities in the Tutor which he could have wished him to have been without tho' as those seemed greatly overballanced by his good Qualities they did not incline Mr  Allworthy  to part with him nor would they indeed have justified such a Proceeding For the Reader is greatly mistaken if he conceives that  Thwackum  appeared to Mr  Allworthy  in the same Light as he doth to him in this History and he is as much deceived if he imagines that the most intimate Acquaintenance  which he himself could have had with that Divine would have informed him of those Things which we from our Inspiration are enabled to open and discover Of Readers who from such Conceits as these condemn the Wisdom or Penetration of Mr  Allworthy  I shall not scruple to say that they make a very bad and ungrateful Use of that Knowledge which we have communicated to them  These apparent Errors in the Doctrine of  Thwackum  served greatly to palliate the contrary Errors in that of  Square  which our good Man no less saw and condemned He thought indeed that the different Exuberancies of these Gentlemen would correct their different Imperfections and that from both especially with his Assistance the two Lads would derive sufficient Precepts of true Religion and Virtue If the Event happened contrary to his Expectations this possibly proceeded from some Fault in the Plan itself which the Reader hath my Leave to discover if he can For we do not pretend to introduce any infallible Characters into this History where we hope nothing will be found which never hath yet been seen in human Nature  To return therefore the Reader will not I think wonder that the different Behaviour of the two Lads above commemorated produced the different Effects of which he hath already seen some Instance and besides this there was another Reason for the Conduct of the Philosopher and the Pedagogue but this being Matter of great Importance we shall reveal it in the next Chapter  CHAP VI  Containing a better Reason still for the beforementioned Opinions  IT is to be known then that those two learned Personages who have lately made a considerable Figure  on the Theatre of this History had from their  rst Arrival at Mr  Allworthy'  s House taken so great  n Affection the one to his Virtue the other to his Religion that they had meditated the closest Alliance with him  For this Purpose they had cast their Eyes on that  air Widow whom tho' we have not for some Time made any mention of her the Reader we trust hath not forgot Mrs  Blifil  was indeed the Object to which they both aspired  It may seem remarkable that of four Persons whom we have commemorated at Mr  Allworthy'  s House three of them should fix their Inclinations on a Lady who was never greatly celebrated for her Beauty and who was moreover now a little descended into the Vale of Years but in reality Bosom Friends and intimate Acquaintance have a kind of natural Propensity to particular Females at the House of a Friend viz to his Grandmother Mother Sister Daughter Aunt Neice and Cousin when they are rich and to his Wife Sister Daughter Neice Cousin Mistress or Servant Maid if they should be handsome  We would not however have our Reader imagine that Persons of such Characters as were supported by  Thwackum  and  Square  would undertake a Matter of this Kind which hath been a little censured by some rigid Moralists before they had thoroughly examined it and considered whether it was as  Shakespear  phrases it 'Stuff o' th' Conscience' or no  Thwackum  was encouraged to the Undertaking by reflecting that to court your Neighbour's Sister is no where forbidden and he knew it was a Rule in the Construction of all Laws that  "Expressum facit cessare Tacitum"  the Sense of which is 'When a Lawgiver sets down plainly his whole Meaning we are prevented from making him mean what we please ourselves' As some Instances of Women therefore  are mentioned in the divine Law which forbids us to covet our Neighbours Goods and that of a Sister omitted he concluded it to be lawful And as to  Square  who was in his Person what is called a jolly Fellow or a Widow's Man he easily reconciled his Choice to the eternal Fitness of Things  Now as both these Gentlemen were industrious in taking every Opportunity of recommending themselves to the Widow they apprehended one certain Method was by giving her Son the constant Preference to the other Lad and as they conceived the Kindness and Affection which Mr  Allworthy  shewed the latter must be highly disagreeable to her they doubted not but the laying hold on all Occasions to degrade and villify him would be highly pleasing to her who as she hated the Boy must love all those who did him any hurt In this  Thwackum  had the Advantage for while  Square  could only scarify the poor Lad's Reputation he could flea his Skin and indeed he considered every Lash he gave him as a Compliment paid to his Mistress so that he could with the utmost Propriety repeat this old flogging Line  "Castigo te non quod odio habeam sed quod  AMEM I chastise thee not out of Hatred but out of Love" And this indeed he often had in his Mouth or rather according to the old Phrase never more properly applied at his Fingers Ends  For this Reason principally the two Gentlemen concurred as we have seen above in their Opinion concerning the two Lads this being indeed almost the only Instance of their concurring on any Point For besides the Difference of their Principles they had both long ago strongly suspected each others Design and hated one another with no little Degree of Inveteracy  This mutual Animosity was a good deal increased by their alternate Successes For Mrs  Blifil  knew what they would be at long before they imagined it  or indeed intended she should For they proceeded with great Caution lest she should be offended and acquaint Mr  Allworthy  but they had no Reason for any such Fear She was well enough pleased with a Passion of which she intended none should have any Fruits but herself And the only Fruits she designed for herself were Flattery and Courtship for which Purpose she soothed them by Turns and a long Time equally She was indeed rather inclined to favour the Parson's Principles but  Square'  s Person was more agreeable to her Eye for he was a comely Man whereas the Pedagogue did in Countenance very nearly resemble that Gentleman who in the Harlot's Progress is seen correcting the Ladies in  Bridewel  Whether Mrs  Blifil  had been surfeited with the Sweets of Marriage or disgusted by its Bitters or from what other Cause it proceeded I will not determine but she could never be brought to listen to any second Proposals However she at last conversed with  Square  with such a Degree of Intimacy that malicious Tongues began to whisper Things of her to which as well for the Sake of the Lady as that they were highly disagreeable to the Rule of Right and the Fitness of Things we will give no Credit and therefore shall not blot our Paper with them The Pedagogue 'tis certain whipt on without getting a Step nearer to his Journey's End  Indeed he had committed a great Error and that  Square  discovered much sooner than himself Mrs  Blifl  as perhaps the Readers may have formerly guess'd was not over and above pleased with the Behaviour of her Husband nay to be honest she absolutely hated him till his Death at last a little reconciled him to her Affections It will not be therefore greatly wondered at if she had not the most violent Regard to the Offspring she had by him And in fact he had so little of this Regard that in his Infancy she  seldom saw her Son or took any Notice of him and hence she acquiesced after a little Reluctance in all the Favours which Mr  Allworthy  showered on the Foundling whom the good Man called his own Boy and in all Things put on an intire Equality with Master  Blifil  This Acquiescence in Mrs  Blifil  was considered by the Neighbours and by the Family as a Mark of her Condescension to her Brother's Humour and she was imagined by all others as well as  Thwackum  and  Square  to hate the Foundling in her Heart nay the more Civility she shewed him the more they conceived she detested him and the surer Schemes she was laying for his Ruin For as they thought it her Interest to hate him it was very difficul for her to perswade them she did not  Thwackum  was the more confirmed in his Opinion as she had more than once caused him to whip  Tom Jones  when Mr  Allworthy  who was an Enemy to this Exercise was abroad whereas she had never given any such Orders concerning young  Blifil  And this had likewise imposed upon  Square  In reality though she certainly hated her own Son of which however monstrous it appears I am assured she is not a singular Instance she appeared notwithstanding all her outward Compliance to be in her Heart sufficiently displeased with all the Favour shewn by Mr  Allworthy  to the Foundling She frequently complained of this behind her Brother's Back and very sharply censured him for it both to  Thwackum  and  Square  nay she would throw it in the Teeth of  Allworthy  himself when a little Quarrel or Miff as it is vulgarly called arose between them  However when  Tom  grew up and gave Tokens of that Gallantry of Temper which greatly recommends Men to Women this Disinclination which she had discovered to him when a Child by Degrees abated and at last she so evidently demonstrated her Affection to him to be much stronger than what she  bore her own Son that it was impossible to mistake her any longer She was so desirous of often seeing him and discovered such Satisfaction and Delight in his Company that before he was eighteen Years old he was become a Rival to both  Square  and  Thwackum  and what is worse the whole Country began to talk as loudly of her Inclination to  Tom  as they had before done of that which she had shewn to  Square  on which Account the Philosopher conceived the most  mplacable Hatred for our poor Hero  CHAP VII  In which the Author himself makes his Appearance on the Stage  THO' Mr  Allworthy  was not of himself hasty to see Things in a Disadvantageous Light and was a Stranger to the public Voice which seldom reaches to a Brother or a Husband tho' it rings in the Ears of all the Neighbourhood yet was this Affection of Mrs  Blifil  to  Tom  and the Preference which she too visibly gave him to her own Son of the utmost Disadvantage to that Youth  For such was the Compassion which inhabited Mr  Allworthy'  s Mind that nothing but the Steel of Justice could ever subdue it To be unfortunate in any Respect was sufficient if there was no Demerit to counterpoise it to turn the Scale of that good Man's Pity and to engage his Friendship and his Benefaction  When therefore he plainly saw Master  Blifil  was absolutely detested for that he was by his own Mother he began on that Account only to look with an Eye of Compassion upon him and what the Effects of Compassion are in good and benevolent Minds I need not here explain to most of my Readers  Henceforward he saw every Appearance of Virtue in the Youth thro' the magnifying End and viewed  all his Faults with the Glass inverted so that they became scarce perceptible And this perhaps the amiable Temper of Pity may make commendable but the next Step the Weakness of human Nature alone must excuse For he no sooner perceived that Preference which Mrs  Blifil  gave to  Tom  than that poor Youth however innocent began to sink in his Affections as he rose in hers This it is true would of itself alone never have been able to eradicate  Jones  from his Bosom but it was greatly injurious to him and prepared Mr  Allworthy'  s Mind for those Impressions which afterwards produced the mighty Event that will be contained hereafter in this History and to which it must be confest the unfortunate Lad by his own Wantonness Wildness and want of Caution too much contributed  In recording some Instances of these we shall if rightly understood afford a very useful Lesson to those welldisposed Youths who shall hereafter be our Readers For they may here find that Goodness of Heart and Openness of Temper tho' these may give them great Comfort within and administer to an honest Pride in their own Minds will by no Means alas do their Business in the World Prudence and Circumspection are necessary even to the best of Men They are indeed as it were a Guard to Virtue without which she can never be safe It is not enough tha  your Designs nay that your Actions are intrinsically good you must take Care they shall appear so If you  Inside be never so beautiful you must preserve a fai  Outside also This must be constantly looked to o  Malice and Envy will take Care to blacken it so tha  the Sagacity and Goodness of an  Allworthy  will not be able to see through it and to discern the Beauties within Let this my younger Readers be you  constant Maxim That no Man can be good enough to enable him to neglect the Rules of Prudence not will Virtue herself look beautiful unless she be be+  decked with the outward Ornaments of Decency and Decorum And this Precept my worthy Disciples if you read with due Attention you will I hope find sufficiently enforced by Examples in the following Pages  I ask Pardon for this short Appearance by way of Chorus on the Stage It is in Reality for my own Sake that while I am discovering the Rocks on which Innocence and Goodness often split I may not be misunderstood to recommend the very Means to my worthy Readers by which I intend to shew them they will be undone And this as I could not prevail on any of my Actors to speak I was obliged to declare my self  CHAP VIII  A childish Incident in which however is seen a good natur'd Disposition in  Tom Jones  THE Reader may remember that Mr  Allworthy  gave  Tom Jones  a little Horse as a kind of smart Money for the Punishment which he imagined he had suffered innocently  This Horse  Tom  kept above half a Year and then rode him to a neighbouring Fair and sold him  At his Return being questioned by  Thwackum  what he had done with the Money for which the Horse was sold he frankly declared he would not tell him  Oho says  Thwackum  you will not then I will have it out of your Brh that being the Place to which he always applied for Information on every doubtful Occasion  Tom  was now mounted on the Back of a Footman and every Thing prepared for Execution when Mr  Allworthy  entering the Room gave the Criminal a Reprieve and took him with him into another Apartment where Mr  Allworthy  being only present with  Tom  he put the same Question to him which  Thwackum  had before asked him  Tom  answered He could in Duty refuse him nothing but as for that tyrannical Rascal he would never make him any other Answer than with a Cudgel with which he hoped soon to be able to pay him for all his Barbarities  Mr  Allworthy  very severely reprimanded the Lad for his indecent and disrespectful Expressions concerning his Master but much more for his avowing an Intention of Revenge He threatened him with the entire Loss of his Favour if he ever heard such another Word from his Mouth for he said he would never support or befriend a Reprobate By these and the like Declarations he extorted some Compunction from  Tom  in which that Youth was not over sincere For he really meditated some Return for all the smarting Favours he had received at the Hands of the Pedagogue He was however brought by Mr  Allworthy  to express a Concern for his Resentment against  Thwackum  and then the good Man after some wholesome Admonition permitted him to proceed which he did as follows  'Indeed my dear Sir I love and honour you more than all the World I know the great Obligations I have to you and should detest myself if I thought my Heart was capable of Ingratitude Could the little Horse you gave me speak I am sure he could tell you how fond I was of your Present For I had more Pleasure in feeding him than in riding him Indeed Sir it went to my Heart to part with him nor would I have sold him upon any other Account in the World than what I did You yourself Sir I am convinced in my Case would have done the same For none ever so sensibly felt the Misfortunes of others What would you feel dear Sir if you thought yourself the Occasion of themIndeed Sir there was never any Misery like theirsLike whose Child" says  Allworthy  what do you mean Oh Sir' answered  Tom  your poor Gamekeeper with all his large Family ever since your discarding him have been perishing with all the Miseries of Cold and Hunger I could not bear to see these poor Wretches naked and starving and at the same Time know myself to have been the Occasion of all their SufferingsI could not bear it Sir upon my Soul I could not" here the Tears run down his Cheeks and he thus proceeded 'It was to save them from absolute Destruction I parted with your dear Present notwithstanding all the Value I had for itI sold the Horse for them and they have every Farthing of the Money'  Mr  Allworthy  now stood silent for some Moments and before he spoke the Tears started from his Eyes He at length dismissed  Tom  with a gentle Rebuke advising him for the future to apply to him in Cases of Distress rather than to use extraordinary Means of relieving them himself  This Affair was afterwards the Subject of much Debate between  Thwackum  and  Square Thwackum  held that this was flying in Mr  Allworthy'  s Face who had intended to punish the Fellow for his Diso+bedience He said in some Instances what the World called Charity appeared to him to be opposing the Will of the Almighty which had marked some particular Persons for Destruction and that this was in like manner acting in Opposition to Mr  Allworthy  concluding as usual with a hearty Recommendation of Birch  Square  argued strongly on the other Side in Opposition perhaps to  Thwackum  or in Compliance with Mr  Allworthy  who seemed very much to approve what  Jones  had done As to what he urged on this Occasion as I am convinced most of my Readers will be much abler Advocates for poor  Jones  it would be impertinent to relate it Indeed it was not difficult to reconcile to the  Rule of Right  an Action which it would have been impossible to deduce from the  Rule of Wrong  CHAP IX  Containing an Incident of a more heinous Kind with the Comments of  Thwackum  and  Square  IT hath been observed by some Man of much greater Reputation for Wisdom than myself that Misfortunes seldom come single An Instance of this may I believe be seen in those Gentlemen who have the Misfortune to have any of their Rogueries detected For here Discovery seldom stops till the whole is come out Thus it happened to poor  Tom  who was no sooner pardoned for selling the Horse than he was discovered to have some time before sold a fine Bible which Mr  Allworthy  gave him the Money arising from which Sale he had disposed in the same Manner This Bible Master  Blifil  had purchased though he had already such another of his own partly out of respect for the Book and partly out of Friendship to  Tom  being unwilling that the Bible should be sold out of the Family at half Price He therefore deposited the said half Price himself for he was a very prudent Lad and so careful of his Money that he had laid up almost every Penny which he had received from Mr  Allworthy  Some People have been noted to be able to read in no Book but their own On the contrary from the Time when Master  Blifil  was first possessed of this Bible he never used any other Nay he was seen reading in it much oftner than he had before been in his own Now as he frequently asked  Thwackum  to explain difficult Passages to him that Gentleman unfortunately took Notice of  Tom'  s Name which was written in many Parts of the Book This brought on an Enquiry which obliged Master  Blifil  to discover the whole Matter  Thwackum  was resolved a Crime of this Kind which he called Sacrilege should not go unpunished  He therefore proceeded immediately to Castigation and not contented with that he acquainted Mr  Allworthy  at their next Meeting with this monstrous Crime as it appeared to him inveighing against  Tom  in the most bitter Terms and likening him to the Buyers and Sellers who were driven out of the Temple  Square  saw this Matter in a very different Light He said He could not perceive any higher Crime in selling one Book than in selling another That to sell Bibles was strictly lawful by all Laws both divine and human and consequently there was no Unfitness in it He told  Thwackum  that his great Concern on this Occasion brought to his Mind the Story of a very devout Woman who out of pure Regard to Religion stole  Tillotson'  s Sermons from a Lady of her Acquaintance  This Story caused a vast Quantity of Blood to rush into the Parson's Face which of itself was none of the palest and he was going to reply with great Warmth and Anger had not Mrs  Blifil  who was present at this Debate interposed That Lady declared herself absolutely of Mr  Square'  s Side She argued indeed very learnedly in Support of his Opinion and concluded with saying If  Tom  had been guilty of any Fault she must confess her own Son appeared to be equally culpable for that she could see no Difference between the Buyer and the Seller both of whom were alike to be driven out of the Temple  Mrs  Blifil  having declared her Opinion put an End to the Debate  Square'  s Triumph would almost have stopt his Words had he needed them and  Thwackum  besides that for Reasons beforementioned he durst not venture at disobliging the Lady was almost choaked with Indignation As to Mr  Allworthy  he said Since the Boy had been already punished he would not deliver his Sentiments on the  Occasion and whether he was or was not angry with the Lad I must leave to the Reader's own Conjecture  Soon after this an Action was brought against the Gamekeeper by 'Squire  Western  the Gentleman in whose Manor the  Partridge  was killed for Depredations of the like Kind This was a most unfortunate Circumstance for the Fellow as it not only of itself threatened his Ruin but actually prevented Mr  Allworthy  from restoring him to his Favour For as that Gentleman was walking out one Evening with Master  Blifil  and young  Jones  the latter slily drew him to the Habitation of  Black George  where the Family of that poor Wretch namely his Wife and Children were found in all the Misery with which Cold Hunger and Nakedness can affect human Creatures For as to the Money they had received from  Jones  former Debts had consumed almost the whole  Such a Scene as this could not fail of affecting the Heart of Mr  Allworthy  He immediately gave the Mother a couple of Guineas with which he bid her cloath her Children The poor Woman burst into Tears at this Goodness and while she was thanking him could not refrain from expressing her Gratitude to  Tom  who had she said long preserved both her and hers from starving We have not says she had a Morsel to eat nor have these poor Children had a Rag to put on but what his Goodness hath bestowed on us For indeed besides the Horse and the Bible  Tom  had sacrificed a Nightgown and other Things to the Use of this distressed Family  On their Return home  Tom  made use of all his Eloquence to display the Wretchedness of these People and the Penitence of  Black George  himself and in this he succeeded so well that Mr  Allworthy  said He thought the Man had suffered enough for what was past that he would forgive him and think of some Means of providing for him and his Family  Jones  was so delighted with this News that though  it was dark when they returned home he could not help going back a Mile in a Shower of Rain to acquaint the poor Woman with the glad Tidings but like other hasty Divulgers of News he only brought on himself the Trouble of contradicting it For the Illfortune of  Black George  made use of the very Opportunity of his Friend's Absence to overturn all again  CHAP X  In which Master  Blifil  and  Jones  appear in different Lights  MASTER  Blifil  fell very short of his Companion in the amiable Quality of Mercy but he as greatly exceeded him in one of a much higher Kind namely in Justice In which he followed both the Precepts and example of  Thwackum  and  Square  for though they would both make frequent Use of the Word  Mercy  yet it was plain that in reality  Square  held it to be inconsistent with the Rule of Right and  Thwackum  was for doing Justice and leaving Mercy to Heaven The two Gentlemen did indeed somewhat differ in Opinion concerning the Objects of this sublime Virtue by which  Thwackum  would probably have destroyed one half of Mankind and  Square  the other half  Master  Blifil  then though he had kept Silence in the Presence of  Jones  yet when he had better considered the Matter he could by no Means endure the Thought of suffering his Uncle to confer Favours on the Undeserving He therefore resolved immediately to acquaint him with the Fact which we have above slightly hinted to the Readers The Truth of which was as follows  The Gamekeeper about a Year after he was dismissed from Mr  Allworthy'  s Service and before  Tom'  s selling the Horse being in Want of Bread either to fill his own Mouth or those of his Family  as he passed through a Field belonging to Mr  Western  espied a Hare sitting in her Form This Hare he had basely and barbarously knocked on the Head against the Laws of the Land and no less against the Laws of Sportsmen  The Higler to whom the Hare was sold being unfortunately taken many Months after with a Quantity of Game upon him was obliged to make his Peace with the 'Squire by becoming Evidence against some Poacher And now  Black George  was pitched upon by him as being a Person already obnoxious to Mr  Western  and one of no good Fame in the Country He was besides the best Sacrifice the Higler could make as he had supplied him with no Game since and by this Means the Witness had an Opportunity of screening his better Customers For the 'Squire being charmed with the Power of Punishing  Black George  whom a single Transgression was sufficient to ruin made no further Enquiry  Had this Fact been truly laid before Mr  Allworthy  it might probably have done the Gamekeeper very little Mischief But there is no Zeal blinder than that which is inspired with the Love of Justice against Offenders Master  Blifil  had forgot the Distance of the Time He varied likewise in the Manner of the Fact and by the hasty Addition of the single Letter S he considerably altered the Story for he said that  George  had wired Hares These Alterations might probably have been set right had not Master  Blifil  unluckily insisted on a Promise of Secrecy from Mr  Allworthy  before he revealed the Matter to him but by that Means the poor Gamekeeper was condemned without having any Opportunity to defend himself For as the Fact of killing the Hare and of the Action brought were certainly true Mr  Allworthy  had no Doubt concerning the rest  Shortlived then was the Joy of these poor People for Mr  Allworthy  the next Morning declared he had  fresh Reason without assigning it for his Anger and strictly forbad  Tom  to mention  George  any more though as for his Family he said he would endeavour to keep them from starving but as to the Fellow himself he would leave him to the Laws which nothing could keep him from breaking  Tom  could by no Means divine what had incensed Mr  Allworthy  For of Master  Blifil  he had not the least Suspicion However as his Friendship was to be tired out by no Disappointments he now determined to try another Method of preserving the poor Gamekeeper from Ruin  Jones  was lately grown very intimate with Mr  Western  He had so greatly recommended himself to that Gentleman by leaping over fivebarred Gates and by other Acts of Sportmanship that the Squire had declared  Tom  would certainly make a great Man if he had but sufficient Encouragement He often wished he had himself a Son with such Parts and one Day very solemnly asserted at a drinking Bout that  Tom  should hunt a Pack of Hounds for a thousand Pound of his Money with any Huntsman in the whole County  By such kind of Talents he had so ingratiated himself with the Squire that he was a most welcome Guest at his Table and a favourite Companion in his Sport Every Thing which the Squire held most dear to wit his Guns Dogs and Horses were now as much at the Command of  Jones  as if they had been his own He resolved therefore to make use of this Favour on Behalf of his Friend  Black George  whom he hoped to introduce into Mr  Western'  s Family in the same Capacity in which he had before served Mr  Allworthy  The Reader if he considers that this Fellow was already obnoxious to Mr  Western  and if he considers farther the weighty Business by which that Gentleman's Displeasure had been incurred will perhaps  condemn this as a foolish and desperate Undertaking but if he should not totally condemn young  Jones  on that Account he will greatly applaud him for strengthening himself with all imaginable Interest on so arduous an Occasion  For this Purpose then  Tom  applied to Mr  Western'  s Daughter a young Lady of about seventeen Years of Age whom her Father next after those necessary Implements of Sport just before mentioned loved and esteemed above all the World Now as she had some Influence on the Squire so  Tom  had some Influence on her But this being the intended Heroine of this Work a Lady with whom we are ourselves greatly in Love and with whom many of our Readers will probably be in Love too before we part it is by no Means proper she should make her Appearance at the End of a Book  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK IV  Containing the Time of a Year  CHAP I  Containing four Pages of Paper  AS Truth distinguishes our Writings from those idle Romances which are filled with Monsters the Productions not of nature but of distempered Brains and which have been therefore recommended by an eminent Critic to the sole Use of the PastryCook So on the other hand we would avoid any Resemblance to that Kind of History which a celebrated Poet seems to think is no less calculated for the Emolument of the Brewer as the reading of it should be always attended with a Tankard of good Ale  WhileHistory with her Comrade Ale  Sooths the sad Series of her serious Tale  For as this is the Liquor of modern Historians nay perhaps their Muse if we may believe the Opinion of  Butler  who attributes inspiration to Ale it ought likewise to be the Potation of their Readers  since every Book ought to be read with the same Spirit and in the same manner as it is writ Thus the famous Author of  Hurlothrumbo  told a learned Bishop that the Reason his Lordship could not taste the Excellence of his Piece was that he did not read it with a Fiddle in his Hand which Instrument he himself always had in his own when he composed it  That our Work therefore might be in no Danger of being likened to the Labours of these Historians we have taken every Occasion of interspersing through the whole sundry Similies Descriptions and other kind of poetical Embellishments These are indeed designed to supply the Place of the said Ale and to refresh the Mind whenever those Slumbers which in a long Work are apt to invade the Reader as well the Writer shall begin to creep upon him Without Interruptions of this Kind the best Narrative of plain Matter of Fact must overpower every Reader for nothing but the everlasting Watchfulness which  Homer  hath ascribed to  Jove  himself can be Proof against a News Paper of many Volumes  We shall leave to the Reader to determine with what Judgment we have chosen the several Occasions for inserting these ornamental Parts of our Work Surely it will be allowed that none could be more proper than the present where we are about to introduce a considerable Character on the Scene no less indeed than the Heroine of this Heroic Historical Prosaic Poem Here therefore we have thought proper to prepare the Mind of the Reader for her Reception by filling it with every pleasing Image which we can draw from the Face of Nature And for this Method we plead many Precedents First this is an Art well known to and much practised by our Tragic Poets who seldom fail to prepare their Audience for the Reception of their principal Characters  Thus the Heroe is always introduced with a flourish of Drums and Trumpets in order to rouse a martial Spirit in the Audience and to accommodate their Ears to Bombast and Fustian which Mr  Lock'  s blind Man would not have grossly erred in likening to the Sound of a Trumpet Again when Lovers are coming forth soft Music often conducts them on the Stage either to sooth the Audience with all the Softness of the tender Passion or to lull or prepare them for that gentle Slumber in which they will most probably be composed by the ensuing Scene  And not only the Poets but the Masters of these Poets the Managers of Playhouses seem to be in this Secret for besides the aforesaid Kettle Drums  c  which denote the Heroe's Approach he is generaly ushered on the Stage by a large Troop of half a dozen Sceneshifters and how necessary these are imagined to his Appearance may be concluded from the following Theatrical Story  King  Pyrrhus  was at Dinner at an Alehouse bordering on the Theatre when he was summoned to go on the Stage The Heroe being unwilling to quit his Shoulder of Mutton and as unwilling to draw on himself the Indignation of Mr  Wilks  his Brother Manager for making the Audience wait had bribed these his Harbingers to be out of the Way While Mr  Wilks  therefore was thundering out  'Where are the Carpenters to walk on before King  Pyrrhus'  that Monarch very quietly eat his Mutton and the Audience however impatient were obliged to entertain themselves with Music in his Absence  To be plain I much question whether the Politician who hath generally a good Nose hath not scented out somewhat of the Utility of this Practice I am convinced that awful Magistrate my Lord Mayor contracts a good deal of that Reverence which attends him through the Year by the several Pageants who precede his Pomp Nay I must confess that  even I myself who am not remarkably liable to be captivated with Show have yielded not a little to the Impressions of much preceding State When I have seen a Man strutting in a Procession after others whose Business hath been only to walk before him I have conceived a higher Notion of his Dignity than I have felt on seeing him in a common Situation But there is one Instance which comes exactly up to my Purpose This is the Custom of sending on a Basketwoman who is to precede the Pomp at a Coronation and to strew the Stage with Flowers before the great Personages begin their Procession The Antients would certainly have invoked the Goddess  Flora  for this Purpose and it would have been no Difficulty for their Priests or Politicians to have persuaded the People of the real Presence of the Deity though a plain Mortal had personated her and performed her Office But we have no such Design of imposing on our Reader and therefore those who object to the Heathen Theology may if they please change our Goddess into the abovementioned Basketwoman Our Intention in short is to introduce our Heroine with the utmost Solemnity in our Power with an Elevation of Stile and all other Circumstances proper to raise the Veneration of our Reader Indeed we would for certain Causes advise those of our Male Readers who have any Hearts to read no farther were we not well assured that how amiable soever the Picture of our Heroine will appear as it is really a Copy from Nature many of our fair Countrywomen will be found worthy to satisfy any Passion and to answer any Idea of Female Perfection which our Pencil will be able to raise  And now without any further Preface we proceed to our next Chapter  CHAP II  A short Hint of what we can do in the Sublime and a Description of Miss  Sophia Western  HUshed be every ruder Breath May the Heathen Ruler of the Winds confine in Iron Chains the boisterous Limbs of noisy  Boreas  and the sharppointed Nose of bitterbiting  Eurus  Do thou sweet  Zephyrus  rising from thy fragrant Bed mount the Western Sky and lead on those delicious Gales the Charms of which call forth the lovely  Flora  from her Chamber perfumed with pearly Dews when on the first of  June  her Birthday the blooming Maid in loose Attire gently trips it over the verdant Mead where every Flower rises to do her Homage till the whole Field becomes enamelled and Colours contend with Sweets which shall ravish her most  So charming may shew now appear and you the feather'd Choristers of Nature whose sweetest Notes not even  Handel  can excel tune your melodious Throats to celebrate her Appearance From Love proceeds your Music and to Love it returns Awaken therefore that gentle Passion in every Swain for lo adorned with all the Charms in which Nature can array her bedecked with Beauty Youth Sprightliness Innocence Modesty and Tenderness breathing Sweetness from her rosy Lips and darting Brightness from her sparkling Eyes the lovely  Sophia  comes  Reader perhaps thou hast seen the Statue of the  Venus de Medicis  Perhaps too thou hast seen the Gallery of Beauties at  Hampton Court  Thou may'st remember  each bright  Churchill  of the Gallaxy  and all the Toasts of the  KitCat  Or if their Reign was before thy Times at least thou hast seen their Daughters the no less dazzling Beauties of the present  Age whose Names should we here insert we apprehended they would fill the whole Volume  Now if thou hast seen all these be not afraid of the rude Answer which Lord  Rochester  once gave to a Man who had seen many Things No If thou hast seen all these without knowing what Beauty is thou hast no Eyes if without feeling its Power thou hast no Heart  Yet is it possible my Friend that thou mayest have seen all these without being able to form an exact Idea of  Sophia  for she did not exactly resemble any of them She was most like the Picture of Lady  Renelagh  and I have heard more still to the famous Dutchess of  Mazarine  but most of all she resembled one whose Image never can depart from my Breast and whom if thou dost remember thou hast then my Friend an adequate Idea of  Sophia  But lest this should not have been thy Fortune we will endeavour with our utmost Skill to describe this Paragon though we are sensible that our highest Abilities are very inadequate to the Task  Sophia  then the only Daughter of Mr  Western  was a middlesized Woman but rather inclining to tall Her Shape was not only exact but extremely delicate and the nice Proportion of her Arms promised the truest Symmetry in her Limbs Her Hair which was black was so luxuriant that it reached her Middle before she cut it to comply with the modern Fashion and it was now curled so gracefully in her Neck that few would believe it to be her own If Envy could find any Part of her Face which demanded less Commendation than the rest it might possibly think her Forehead might have been higher without Prejudice to her Her Eyebrows were full even and arched beyond the Power of Art to imitate Her black Eyes had a Lustre in them which all her Softness could not extinguish Her Nose was  exactly regular and her Mouth in which were two Rows of Ivory exactly answered Sir  John Suckling'  s Description in those Lines  Her Lips were red and one was thin  Compar'd to that was next her Chin  Some Bee had stung it newly  Her Cheeks were of the oval Kind and in her right she had a Dimple which the least Smile discovered Her Chin had certainly its Share in forming the Beauty of her Face but it was difficult to say it was either large or small tho' perhaps it was rather of the former kind Her Complexion had rather more of the Lilly than of the Rose but when Exercise or Modesty encreased her natural Colour no Vermilion could equal it Then one might indeed cry out with the celebrated Dr  Donne  Her pure and eloquent Blood  Spoke in her Cheeks and so distinctly wrought  That one might almost say her Body thought  Her Neck was long and finely turned and here if I was not afraid of offending her Delicacy I might justly say the highest Beauties of the famous  Venus de Medicis  were outdone Here was Whiteness which no Lillies Ivory nor Alabaster could match The finest Cambric might indeed be supposed from Envy to cover that Bosom which was much whiter than itselfIt was indeed  Nitor splendens Pario marmore purius  "A Gloss shining beyond the purest Brightness of  Parian  Marble"  Such was the Outside of  Sophia  nor was this beautiful Frame disgraced by an Inhabitant unworthy of it Her Mind was every way equal to her Person nay the latter borrowed some Charms from the former For when she smiled the Sweetness of her Temper diffused that Glory over her Countenance which no Regularity of Features can give But as there are no Perfections of the Mind which do not discover themselves  in that perfect Intimacy to which we intend to introduce our Reader with this charming young Creature so it is needless to mention them here Nay it is a Kind of tacit Affront to our Reader's Understanding and may also rob him of that Pleasure which he will receive in forming his own Judgment of her Character  It may however be proper to say that whatever mental Accomplishments she had derived from Nature they were somewhat improved and cultivated by Art for she had been educated under the Care of an Aunt who was a Lady of great Discretion and was thoroughly acquainted with the World having lived in her Youth about the Court whence she had retired some Years since into the Country By her Conversation and Instructions  Sophia  was perfectly wellbred though perhaps she wanted a little of that Ease in her Behaviour which is to be acquired only by Habit and living within what is called the polite Circle But this to say the Truth is often too dearly purchased and though it hath Charms so inexpressible that the  French  perhaps among other Qualities mean to express this when they declare they know not what it is yet its Absence is well compensated by Innocence nor can good Sense and a natural Gentility ever stand in need of it  CHAP III  Wherein the History goes back to commemorate a trifling Incident that happened some Years since but which trifling as it was had some future Consequences  THE amiable  Sophia  was now in her eighteenth Year when she is introduced into this History Her Father as hath been said was fonder of her than of any other human Creature To her therefore  Tom Jones  applied in order to engage her Interest  on the Behalf of his Friend the Gamekeeper  But before we proceed to this Business a short Re  apitulation of some previous Matters may be necessary  Though the different Tempers of Mr  Allworthy  and of Mr  Western  did not admit of a very intimate Correspondence yet they lived upon what is called a  ecent Footing together by which Means the young People of both Families had been acquainted from their Infancy and as they were all near of the same Age had been frequent Playmates together  The Gaiety of  Tom'  s Temper suited better with  Sophia  than the grave and sober Disposition of Master  Blifil  And the Preference which she gave the former of these would often appear so plainly that a Lad of a more passionate Turn than Master  Blifil  was might have shewn some Displeasure at it  As he did not however outwardly express any such Disgust it would be an ill Office in us to pay a Visit to the inmost Recesses of his Mind as some scandalous People search into the most secret Affairs of their Friends and often pry into their Closets and Cupboards only to discover their Poverty and Meanness to the World  However as Persons who suspect they have given others Cause of Offence are apt to conclude they are offended so  Sophia  imputed an Action of Master  Blifil  to his Anger which the superior Sagacity of  Thwackum  and  Square  discerned to have arisen from a much better Principle  Tom Jones  when very young had presented  Sophia  with a little Bird which he had taken from the Nest had nursed up and taught to sing  Of this Bird  Sophia  then about thirteen Years old was so extremely fond that her chief Business was to feed and tend it and her chief Pleasure to play with it By these Means little  Tommy  for so the Bird was called was become so tame that it would  feed out of the Hand of its Mistress would perch up on her Finger and lie contented in her Bosom where it seemed almost sensible of its own Happiness tho she always kept a small String about its Leg no would ever trust it with the Liberty of flying away  One Day when Mr  Allworthy  and his whole Fa+mily dined at Mr  Western'  s Master  Blifil  being in the Garden with little  Sophia  and observing the ex+treme Fondness that she shewed for her little Bird de+sired her to trust it for a Moment in his Hands  Sophia  presently complied with the young Gentleman's Request and after some previous Caution delivered him her Bird of which he was no sooner in Possession than he slipt the String from its Leg and tossed it into the Air  The foolish Animal no sooner perceived itself at Liberty than forgetting all the Favours it had received from  Sophia  it flew directly from her and perched on a Bough at some Distance  Sophia  seeing her Bird gone sereamed out so loud that  Tom Jones  who was at a little Distance immediately ran to her Assistance  He was no sooner informed of what had happened than he cursed  Blifil  for a pitiful malicious Rascal and then immediately stripping off his Coat he applied himself to climbing the Tree to which the Bird escaped  Tom  had almost recovered his little Namesake when the Branch on which it was perched and that hung over a Canal broke and the poor Lad plumped over Head and Ears into the Water  Sophia'  s Concern now changed its Object And as she apprehended the Boy's Life was in Danger she screamed ten times louder than before and indeed Master  Blifil  himself now seconded her with all the Vociferation in his Power  The company who were sitting in a Room next the Garden were instantly alarmed and came all  forth but just as they reached the Canal  Tom  for  he Water was luckily pretty shallow in that Part  rrived safely on shore  Thwackum  fell violently on poor  Tom  who stood dropping and shivering before him when Mr  Allworthy  desired him to have Patience and turning to  aster  Blifil  said Pray Child what is the Reason  f all this Disturbance  Master  Blifil  answered 'Indeed Uncle I am very sorry for what I have done I have been unhappily the Occasion of it all I had Miss  Sophia'  s Bird in my Hand and thinking the poor Creature languished for Liberty I own I could not forbear giving it what it desired for I always thought there was something very cruel in confining any Thing It seemed to me against the Law of Nature by which every Thing hath a right to Liberty nay it is even unchristian for it is not doing what we would be done by But if I had imagined Miss  Sophia  would have been so much concerned at it I am sure I would never have done it nay if I had known what would have happened to the Bird itself for when Master  Jones  who climbed up the Tree after it fell into the Water the Bird took a second Flight and presently a nasty Hawk carried it away Poor  Sophia  who now first heard of her little  Tommy'  s Fate for her Concern for  Jones  had pre  ented her perceiving it when it happened shed a Shower of Tears These Mr  Allworthy  endeavoured to assuage promising her a much finer Bird but he declared she would never have another Her Father chid her for crying so for a foolish Bird but could not help telling young  Blifil  if he was a Son of his his Backside should be well flea'd  Sophia  now returned to her Chamber the two  oung Gentlemen were sent home and the rest of the Company returned to their Bottle where a Conversation  ensued on the Subject of the Bird so curious that we think it deserves a Chapter by itself  CHAP IV  Containing such very deep and grave Matters the some Readers perhaps may not relish it  SQUARE  had no sooner lighted his Pipe that addressing himself to  Allworthy  he thus began 'Sir I cannot help congratulating you on your Ne+phew who at an Age when few Lads have any Ideas but of sensible Objects is arrived at a Capa+city of distinguishing Right from Wrong To con+fine any thing seems to me against the Law of Na+ture by which every thing hath a Right to Liberty These were his Words and the Impression they have made on me is never to be eradicated Ca  any Man have a higher Notion of the Rule of Right and the Eternal Fitness of Things I cannot help promising myself from such a Dawn that the Me+ridian of this Youth will be equal to that of either the elder or the younger  Brutus'  Here  Thwackum  hastily interrupted and spilling some of his Wine and swallowing the rest with great Eagerness answered 'From another Expression h  made use of I hope he will resemble much better Men The Law of Nature is a Jargon of Words which means nothing I know not of any such Law nor of any Right which can be derive  from it To do as we would be done by is indeed a Christian Motive as the Boy well expressed him…self and I am glad to find my Instructions hav  born so good Fruit'  'If Vanity was a thing fit says  Square  I might indulge some on the same Occasion for whence h  can only have learnt his Notions of Right or Wrong I think is pretty apparent If there be no Law o  Nature there is no Right nor Wrong'  'How says the Parson do you then banish Revelation Am I talking with a Deist or an Atheist' 'Drink about says  Western  Pox of your Laws of Nature I don't know what you mean either of you by Right and Wrong To take away my Girl's Bird was wrong in my Opinion and my Neighbour  Allworthy  may do as he pleases but to encourage Boys in such Practices is to breed them up to the Gallows'  Allworthy  answered 'that he was sorry for what his Nephew had done but could not consent to punish him as he acted rather from a generous than unworthy Motive' He said 'if the Boy had stolen the Bird none would have been more ready to vote for a severe Chastisement than himself but it was plain that was not his Design' And indeed was as apparent to him that he could have no other View but what he had himself confessed For as to  hat malicious Purpose which  Sophia  suspected it ne  er once entered into the Head of Mr  Allworthy  He at length concluded with again blaming the Action as inconsiderate and which he said was only pardonable in a Child  Square  had delivered his Opinion so openly that  f he was now silent he must submit to have his Judgment censured He said therefore with some Warmth 'that Mr  Allworthy  had too much respect to the dirty Consideration of Property That in passing our Judgments on great and mighty Actions all private Regards should be laid aside for by adhering to those narrow Rules the younger  Brutus  had been condemned of Ingratitude and the elder of Parricide'  And if they had been hanged too for those 'Crimes' cried  Thwackum  'they would have had no more than their Deserts A couple of heathenish Villains Heaven be praised we have no  Brutus'nowadays  I wish Mr  Square  you would desist from filling the Minds of my Pupils with such Antichristian Stuff For the Consequence must be while they are under my Care its being well scourged out of them again There is your Disciple  Tom  almost spoiled already I overheard him the other Day disputing with Master  Blifil  that there was not Merit in Faith without Works I know that is one of your Tenets and I suppose he had it from you'  'Don't accuse me of spoiling him' says  Square  who taught him to laugh at whatever is virtuous and decent and fit and right in the Nature of Things He is your own Scholar and I disclaim him No no Master  Blifil  is my Boy Young as he is tha  Lad's Notions of moral Rectitude I defy you eve  to eradicate'  Thwackum  put on a contemptuous Sneer at this and replied 'Ay ay I will venture him with you He is too well grounded for all your philosophical Cant to hurt No no I have taken Care to instil such Principles into him'  'And I have instilled Principles into him too cries  Square  'What but the sublime Idea of Vir+tue could inspire a human Mind with the generous Thought of giving Liberty And I repeat to yo  again if it was a fit thing to be proud I might claim the Honour of having infused that Idea'  'And if Pride was not forbidden' said  Thwackum  'I might boast of having taught him that Duty which he himself assigned as his Motive'  'So between you both' says the Squire 'the your Gentleman hath been taught to rob my Daughter o  …her Bird I find I must take Care of my Partridg  Mew I shall have some virtuous religious Ma  or other  t all my Partridges at Liberty' The slapping a Gentleman of the Law who was pres  n  on the Back He cried out 'What say you to this Mr Counsellor Is not this against Law'  The Lawyer with great Gravity delivered himself as follows  'If the Case be put of a Partridge there can be no Doubt but an Action would lie For though this be  ferae Naturae  yet being reclaimed Property vests but being the Case of a Singing Bird though reclaimed as it is a Thing of base Nature it must be considered as  nullius in Bonis  In this Case therefore I conceive the Plaintiff must be nonsuited and I should disadvise the bringing any such Action'  'Well says the Squire if it be  nullus Bonus  let us drink about and talk a little of the State of the Nation or some such Discourse that we all understand for I am sure I don't understand a Word of this It may be Learning and Sense for aught I know but you shall never persuade me into it Pox you have neither of you mentioned a Word of that poor Lad who deserves to be commended To venture breaking his Neck to oblige my Girl was a generous spirited Action I have Learning enough to see that Dn me here's  Tom'  s Health I shall love the Boy for it the longest Day I have to live'  Thus was this Debate interrupted but it would  robably have been soon resumed had not Mr  Allworthy  presently called for his Coach and carried off  he two Combatants  Such was the Conclusion of this Adventure of the Bird and the Dialogue occasioned by it which we  ould not help recounting to our Reader though it  appened some Years before the Stage or Period of Time at which our History is now arrived  CHAP V  Containing Matter accommodated to every Taste  PARVA leves capiunt Animos  'Small Things affect light Minds' was the Sentiment of a great Master of the Passion of Love And certain it is that from this Day  Sophia  began to have some little Kindness for  Tom Jones  and no little Aversion for his Companion  Many Accidents from time to time improved both these Passions in her Breast which without our recounting the Reader may well conclude from what we have before hinted of the different Tempers of these Lads and how much the one suited with her own Inclinations more than the other To say the Truth  Sophia  when very young discerned that  Tom  though an idle thoughtless rattling Rascal was nobody's Enemy but his own and that Master  Blifil  though a prudent discreet sober young Gentleman was at the same Time strongly attached to the Interest only of one single Person and who that single Person was the Reader will be able to divine without any Assistance of ours  These two Characters are not always received in the World with the different Regard which seems severally due to either and which one would imagine Mankind from selfinterest should shew towards them But perhaps there may be a political Reason for it In finding one of a truly benevolent Disposition Men may very reasonably suppose they have found a Treasure and be desirous of keeping it like all other good Things to themselves Hence they may imagine that to trumpet forth the Praises of such a Person would in the vulgar Phrase be crying  Roastmeat  and calling in Partakers of what they intend to apply solely to their own Use If this Reason doth not satisfy the Reader I know no other Means of accounting  for the little Respect which I have commonly seen paid to a Character which really doth great Honour to Human Nature and is productive of the highest Good to Society But it was otherwise with  Sophia  She honoured  Tom Jones  and scorned Master  Blifil  almost as soon as she knew the Meaning of those two Words  Sophia  had been absent upwards of three Years with her Aunt during all which Time she had seldom seen either of these young Gentlemen She dined however once together with her Aunt at Mr  Allworthy'  s This was a few Days after the Adventure of the Partridge before commemorated  Sophia  heard the whole Story at Table where she said nothing nor indeed could her Aunt get many Words from her as she returned home but her Maid when undressing her happening to say 'Well Miss I suppose you have seen young Master  Blifil  to Day' She answered with much Passion 'I hate the Name of Master  Blifil  as I do whatever is base and treacherous and I wonder Mr  Allworthy  would suffer that old barbarous Schoolmaster to punish a poor Boy so cruelly for what was only the Effect of his Goodnature' She then recounted the Story to her Maid and concluded with Saying'Don't you think he is a Boy of a noble Spirit'  This young Lady was now returned to her Father who gave her the Command of his House and placed her at the upper End of his Table where  Tom  who from his great Love of Hunting was become a great Favourite of the Squire often dined Young Men of open generous Dispositions are naturally inclined to Gallantry which if they have good understandings as was in reality  Tom'  s Case exerts itself in an obliging complaisant Behaviour to all Women in general This greatly distinguished  Tom  from the boisterous Brutality of mere Country Squires on the one hand and from the solemn and somewhat fullen  Deportment of Master  Blifil  on the other And he began now at Nineteen to have the Name of a pretty Fellow among all the Women in the Neighbourhood  Tom  behaved to  Sophia  with no Particularity unless perhaps by shewing her a higher Respect than he paid to any other This Distinction her Beauty Fortune Sense and amiable Carriage seemed to demand but as to Design upon her Person he had none for which we shall at present suffer the Reader to condemn him of Stupidity but perhaps we shall be able indifferently well to account for it hereafter  Sophia  with the highest Degree of Innocence and Modesty had a remarkable Sprightliness in her Temper This was so greatly encreased whenever she was in Company with  Tom  that had he not been very young and thoughtless he must have observed it or had not Mr  Western'  s Thoughts been generally either in the Field the Stable or the Dogkennel it might have perhaps created some Jealousy in him but so far was the good Gentleman from entertaining any such Suspicions that he gave  Tom  every Opportunity with his Daughter which any Lover could have wished And these  Tom  innocently improved to better Advantage by following only the Dictates of his natural Gallantry and goodnature than he might perhaps have done had he had the deepest Designs on the young Lady  But indeed it can occasion little Wonder that this Matter escaped the Observation of others since poor  Sophia  herself never remarked it and her Heart was irretrivably lost before she suspected it was in Danger  Matters were in this Situation when  Tom  one Afternoon finding  Sophia  alone began after a short Apology with a very serious Face to acquaint her that he had a Favour to ask of her which he hoped her Goodness would comply with  Though neither the young Man's Behaviour nor  indeed his Manner of opening this Business were such as could give her any just Cause of suspecting he intended to make Love to her yet whether Nature whispered something into her Ear or from what Cause it arose I will not determine certain it is some Idea of that Kind must have intruded itself for her Colour forsook her Cheeks her Limbs trembled and her Tongue would have faultered had  Tom  stopped for an Answer But he soon relieved her from her Perplexity by proceeding to inform her of his Request which was to sollicit her Interest on Behalf of the Gamekeeper whose own Ruin and that of a large Family must be he said the Consequence of Mr  Western'  s pursuing his Action against him  Sophia  presently recovered her Confusion and with a Smile full of Sweetness said 'Is this the mighty Favour you asked with so much Gravity I will do it with all my Heart I really pity the poor Fellow and no longer ago than Yesterday sent a small Matter to his Wife' This small Matter was one of her Gowns some Linnen and ten Shillings in Money of which  Tom  had heard and it had in reality put this Solicitation into his Head  Our Youth now emboldened with his Success resolved to push the Matter farther and ventured even to beg her Recommendation of him to her Father's Service protesting that he thought him one of the honestest Fellows in the Country and extremely well qualified for the Place of a Gamekeeper which luckily then happened to be vacant  Sophia  answered 'Well I will undertake this too but I cannot promise you as much Success as in the former Part which I assure you I will not quit my Father without obtaining However I will do what I can for the poor Fellow for I sincerely look upon him and his Family as Objects of great Compassion''And now Mr  Jones  I must ask' you a Favour'  'A Favour Madam cries  Tom  if you knew the Pleasure you have given me in the Hopes of receiving a Command from you you would think by mentioning it you must confer the greatest Favour on me for by this dear Hand I would sacrifice my Life to oblige you'  He then snatched her Hand and eagerly kissed it which was the first Time his Lips had ever touched her The Blood which before had forsaken her Cheeks now made her sufficient Amends by rushing all over her Face and Neck with such Violence that they became all of a scarlet Colour She now first felt a Sensation to which she had been before a Stranger and which when she had Leisure to reflect on it began to acquaint her with some Secrets which the Reader if he doth not already guess them will know in due Time  Sophia  as soon as she could speak which was not instantly informed him that the Favour she had to desire of him was not to lead her Father through so many Dangers in Hunting for that from what she had heard she was terribly frightened every Time they went out together and expected some Day or other to see her Father brought Home with broken Limbs She therefore begged him for her Sake to be more cautious and as he well knew Mr  Western  would follow him not to ride so madly nor to take those dangerous Leaps for the future  Tom  faithfully promised to obey her Commands and after thanking her for her kind Compliance with his Request took his Leave and departed highly charmed with his Success  Poor  Sophia  was charmed too but in a very different Way Her Sensations however the Reader's Heart if he or she have any will better represent than I can if I had as many Mouths as ever Poet wished for to eat I suppose those many Dainties with which he was so plentifully provided  It was Mr  Western'  s Custom every Afternoon as soon as he was drunk to hear his Daughter play on the Harpsichord for he was a great Lover of Music and perhaps had he lived in Town might have passed for a Connoisseur for he always excepted against the finest Compositions of Mr  Handel  He never relished any Music but what was light and airy and indeed his most favourite Tunes were  Old Sir  Simon  the King St  George  he was for  England  Bobbing  Joan and some others  His Daughter tho' she was a perfect Mistress of Music and would never willingly have played any but  Handel'  s was so devoted to her Father's Pleasure that she learnt all those Tunes to oblige him However she would now and then endeavour to lead him into her our own Taste and when he required the Repetition of his Ballads would answer with a 'Nay dear Sir' and would often beg him to suffer her to play something else  This Evening however when the Gentleman was retired from his Bottle she played all his Favourites three Times over without any Solicitation This so pleased the good Squire that he started from his Couch gave his Daughter a Kiss and swore her Hand was greatly improved She took this Opportunity to execute her promise to  Tom  in which she succeeded so well that the Squire declared if she would give him t'other Bout of old Sir  Simon  he would give the Gamekeeper his Deputation the next Morning Sir  Simon  was played again and again till the Charms of the Music soothed Mr  Western  to sleep In the Morning  Sophia  did not fail to remind him of his Engagement and his Attorney was immediately sent for ordered to stop any further proceedings in the Action and to make out the Deputation  Tom'  s Success in this Affair soon began to ring over the Country and various were the Censures past upon  it Some greatly applauded it as an Act of good Nature others sneering and saying 'No Wonder that one idle Fellow should love another' Young  Blifil  was greatly enraged at it He had long hated  Black George  in the same Proportion as  Jones  delighted in him not for any offence which he had ever received but from his great Love to Religion and Virtue For  Black George  had the Reputation of a loose kind of a Fellow  Blifil  therefore represented this as flying in Mr  Allworthy'  s Face and declared with great Concern that it was impossible to find any other Motive for doing Good to such a Wretch  Thwackum  and  Square  likewise sung to the same Tune They were now especially the latter become greatly jealous of young  Jones  with the Widow For he now approached the Age of Twenty was really a fine young Fellow and that Lady by her Encouragements to him seemed daily more and more to think him so  Allworthy  was not however moved with their Malice He declared himself very well satisfied with what  Jones  had done He said the Perseverance and Integrity of his Friendship was highly commendable and he wished he could see more frequent Instances of that Virtue  But Fortune who seldom greatly relishes such Sparks as my Friend  Tom  perhaps because they do not pay more ardent Addresses to her gave now a very different Turn to all his Actions and shewed them to Mr  Allworthy  in a Light far less agreeable than that Gentleman's Goodness had hitherto seen them in  CHAP VI  An Apology for the Insensibility of Mr  Jones  to all the Charms of the lovely  Sophia  in which possibly we may in a considerable Degree lower his Character in the Estimation of those Men of Wit and Gallantry who approve the Heroes in most of our modern Comedies  THERE are two Sorts of People who I am afraid have already conceived some Contempt for my Heroe on Account of his Behaviour to  Sophia  The former of these will blame his Prudence in neglecting an Opportunity to possess himself of Mr  Western'  s Fortune and the latter will no less despise him for his Backwardness to so fine a Girl who seemed ready to fly into his Arms if he would open them to receive her  Now though I shall not perhaps be able absolutely to acquit him of either of these Charges for Want of Prudence admits of no Excuse and what I shall produce against the latter Charge will I apprehend be scarce satisfactory yet as Evidence may sometimes be offered in Mitigation I shall set forth the plain Matter of Fact and leave the whole to the Reader's Determination  Mr  Jones  had somewhat about him which though I think Writers are not thoroughly agreed in its Name doth certainly inhabit some human Breasts whose Use is not so properly to distinguish Right from Wrong as to prompt and incite them to the former and to restrain and withhold them from the latter  This Somewhat may be indeed resembled to the famous Trunkmaker in the Playhouse for whenever the Person who is possessed of it doth what is right no ravished or friendly Spectator is so eager or so loud in his Applause on the contrary when he doth wrong no Critic is so apt to hiss and explode him  To give a higher Idea of the Principle I mean as well as one more familiar to the present Age it may be considered as sitting on its Throne in the Mind like the LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR of this Kingdom in his Court where it presides governs directs judges acquits and condemns according to Merit and Justice with a Knowledge which nothing escapes a Penetration which nothing can deceive and an Integrity which nothing can corrupt  This Active Principle may perhaps be said to constitute the most essential Barrier between us and our Neighbours the Brutes for if there be some in the human Shape who are not under any such Dominion I chuse rather to consider them as Deserters from us to our Neighbours among whom they will have the Fate of Deserters and not be placed in the first Rank  Our Heroe whether he derived it from  Thwackum  or  Square  I will not determine was very strongly under the Guidance of this Principle for though he did not always act rightly yet he never did otherwise without feeling and suffering for it It was this which taught him that to repay the Civilities and little Friendships of Hospitality by robbing the House where you have received them is to be the basest and meanest of Thieves He did not think the Baseness of this Offence lessened by the Height of the Injury committed on the contrary if to steal another's Plate deserved Death and Infamy it seemed to him difficult to assign a Punishment adequate to the robbing a Man of his whole Fortune and of his Child into the Bargain  This Principle therefore prevented him from any Thought of making his Fortune by such Means for this as I have said is an active Principle and doth not content itself with Knowledge or Belief only Had he been greatly enamoured of  Sophia  he possibly might have thought otherwise but give me Leave to  say there is great Difference between running away with a Man's Daughter from the Motive of Love and doing the same Thing from the Motive of Theft  Now though this young Gentleman was not insensible of the Charms of  Sophia  tho' he greatly liked her Beauty and esteemed all her other Qualifications she had made however no deep Impression on his Heart For which as it renders him liable to the Charge of Stupidity or at least of Want of Taste we shall now proceed to account  The Truth then is his Heart was in the Possession of another Woman Here I question not but the Reader will be surprized at our long Taciturnity as to this Matter and at no less Loss to divine who this Woman was since we have hitherto not dropt a Hint of any one likely to be a Rival to  Sophia  For as to Mrs  Blifil  though we have been obliged to mention some Suspicions of her Affection for  Tom  we have not hitherto given the least Latitude for imagining that he had any for her and indeed I am sorry to say it but the Youth of both Sexes are too apt to be deficient in their Gratitude for that Regard with which Persons more advanced in Years are sometimes so kind to honour them  That the Reader may be no longer in Suspence he will be pleased to remember that we have often mentioned the Family of  George Seagrim  commonly called  Black George  the Gamekeeper which consisted at present of a Wife and five Children  The second of these Children was a Daughter whose Name was  Molly  and who was esteemed one of the handsomest Girls in the whole Country  Congreve  well says  There is in true Beauty something which vulgar Souls cannot admire  so can no Dirt or Rags hide this Something from those Souls which are not of the vulgar Stamp  The Beauty of this Girl made however no Impression on  Tom  till she grew towards the Age of  Sixteen when  Tom  who was near three Years older began first to cast the Eyes of Affection upon her And this Affection he had fixed on the Girl long before he could bring himself to attempt the Possession of her Person for tho' his Constitution urged him greatly to this his Principles no less forcibly restrained him To debauch a young Woman however low her Condition was appeared to him a very heinous Crime and the Goodwill he bore the Father with the Compassion he had for his Family very strongly corroborated all such sober Reflections so that he once resolved to get the better of his Inclinations and he actually abstained three whole Months without ever going to  Seagrim'  s House or seeing his Daughter  Now though  Molly  was as we have said generally thought a very fine Girl and in reality she was so yet her Beauty was not of the most amiable Kind It had indeed very little of Feminine in it and would at least have become a Man as well as a Woman for to say the Truth Youth and florid Health had a very considerable Share in the Composition  Nor was her Mind more effeminate than her Person As this was tall and robust so was that bold and forward So little had she of Modesty that  Jones  had more Regard for her Virtue than she herself And as most probably she liked  Tom  as well as he liked her so when she perceived his Backwardness she herself grew proportionably forward and when she saw he had entirely deserted the House she found Means of throwing herself in his Way and behaved in such a Manner that the Youth must have had very much or very little of the Heroe if her Endeavours had proved unsuccessful In a Word she soon triumphed over all the virtuous Resolutions of  Jones  For though she behaved at last with all decent Reluctance yet I rather chuse to attribute the Triumph  to her Since in Fact it was her Design which succeeded  In the Conduct of this Matter  Molly  so well played her Part that  Jones  attributed the Conquest entirely to himself and considered the young Woman as one who had yielded to the violent Attacks of his Passion He likewise imputed her yielding to the ungovernable Force of her Love towards him and this the Reader will allow to have been a very natural and probable Supposition as we have more than once mentioned the uncommon Comeliness of his Person And indeed he was one of the handsomest young Fellows in the World  As there are some Minds whose Affections like Master  Blifl'  s are solely placed on one single Person whose Interest and indulgence alone they consider on every Occasion regarding the Good and Ill of all others as merely indifferent any farther than as they contribute to the Pleasure or Advantage of that Person So there is a different Temper of Mind which borrows a Degree of Virtue even from Selflove such can never receive any kind of Satisfaction from another without loving the Creature to whom that Satisfaction is owing and without making its Wellbeing in some sort necessary to their own Ease  Of this latter Species was our Heroe He considered this poor Girl as one whose Happiness or Misery he had caused to be dependent on himself Her Beauty was still the Object of Desire though greater Beauty or a fresher Object might have been more so but the little Abatement which Fruition had occasioned to this was highly overballanced by the Considerations of the Affection which she visibly bore him and of the Situation into which he had brought her The former of these created Gratitude the latter Compassion and both together with his Desire for her Person raised in him a Passion which might without any great Violence to the Word be called  Love  though perhaps it was at first not very judiciously placed  This then was the true Reason of that Insensibility which he had shewn of the Charms of  Sophia  and of that Behaviour in her which might have been reasonable enough interpreted as an Encouragement to his Addresses For as he could not think of abandoning his  Molly  poor and destitute as she was so no more could he entertain a Notion of betraying such a Creature as  Sophia  And surely had he given the least Encouragement to any Passion for that young Lady he must have been absolutely guilty of one or other of those Crimes either of which would in my Opinion have very justly subjected him to that Fate which at his first Introduction into this History I mentioned to have been generally predicted as his certain Destiny  CHAP VII  Being the shortest Chapter in this Book  HER Mother first perceived the Alteration in the Shape of  Molly  and in order to hide it from her Neighbours she foolishly clothed her in that Sack which  Sophia  had sent her Though indeed that young Lady had little Apprehension that the poor Woman would have been weak enough to let any of her Daughters wear it in that Form  Molly  was charmed with the first Opportunity she had ever had of shewing her Beauty to Advantage for though she could very well bear to contemplate herself in the Glass even when drest in Rags and though she had in that Dress conquered the Heart of  Jones  and perhaps of some others yet she thought the Addition of Finery would much improve her Charms and extend her Conquests  Molly  therefore having dressed herself out in this Sack with a new laced Cap and some other Ornaments  which  Tom  had given her repairs to Church with her Fan in her Hand the very next  Sunday  The Great are deceived if they imagine they have appropriated Ambition and Vanity to themselves These noble Qualities flourish as notably in a Country Church and Churchyard as in the DrawingRoom or in the Closet Schemes have indeed been laid in the Vestry which would hardly disgrace the Conclave Here is a Ministry and here is an Opposition Here are Plots and Circumventions Parties and Factions equal to those which are to be found in Courts  Nor are the Women here less practised in the highest Feminine Arts than their fair Superiors in Quality and Fortune Here are prudes and Coquettes Here are Dressing and Ogling Falshood Envy Malice Scandal in short every Thing which is common to the most splendid Assembly or politest Circle Let those of high Life therefore no longer despise the Ignorance of their Inferiors nor the Vulgar any longer rail at the Vices of their Betters  Molly  had seated herself some time before she was known by her Neighbours and a Whisper ran through the whole Congregation 'Who is she' But when she was discovered such sneering gigling tittering and laughing ensued among the Women that Mr  Allworthy  was obliged to exert his Authority to preserve any Decency among them  CHAP VIII  A Battle sung by the Muse in the  Homerican  Stile and which none but the classical Reader can taste  MR  Western  had an Estate in this Parish and as his House stood at little greater Distance from this Church than from his own he very often came to divine Service here and both he and the charming  Sophia  happened to be present at this Time  Sophia  was much pleased with the Beauty of the  Girl whom she pitied for her Simplicity in having dressed herself in that Manner as she saw the Envy which it had occasioned among her Equals She no sooner came home than she sent for the Gamekeeper and ordered him to bring his Daughter to her saying She would provide for her in the Family and might possibly place the Girl about her own Person when her own Maid who was now going away had left her  Poor  Seagrim  was thunderstruck at this for he was no Stranger to the Fault in the Shape of his Daughter He answered in a stammering Voice 'That he was afraid  Molly  would be too aukward to wait on her Ladyship as she had never been at Service' 'No matter for that' says  Sophia  'she will soon improve I am pleased with the Girl and am resolved to try her'  Black George  now repaired to his Wife on whose prudent Council he depended to extricate him out of this Dilemma but when he came thither he found his House in some Confusion So great Envy had this Sack occasioned that when Mr  Allworthy  and the other Gentry were gone from Church the Rage which had hitherto been confined burst into an Uproar and having vented itself at first in opprobrious Words Laughs Hisses aud Gestures betook itself at last to certain missile Weapons which though from their plastic Nature they threatened neither the Loss of Life or of Limb were however sufficiently dreadful to a welldressed Lady  Molly  had too much Spirit to bear this Treatment tamely Having thereforeBut hold as we are diffident of our own Abilities let us here invite a superior Power to our Assistance  Ye Muses then whoever you are who love to sing Battles and principally thou who whileom didst recount the Slaughter in those Fields where  Hudibras  and  Trulla  fought if thou wert not starved with thy  Friend  Butler  assist me on this great Occasion All things are not in the Power of all  As a vast Herd of Cows in a rich Farmer's Yard if while they are milked they hear their Calves at a Distance lamenting the Robbery which is then committing roar and bellow So roared forth the  Somersetshire  Mob an Hallaloo made up of almost as many Squawls Screams and other different Sounds as there were Persons or indeed Passions among them Some were inspired by Rage others alarmed by Fear and others had nothing in their Heads but the Love of Fun but chiefly Envy the Sister of  Satan  and his constant Companion rushed among the Crowd and blew up the Fury of the Women who no sooner came up to  Molly  than they pelted her with Dirt and Rubbish  Molly  having endeavoured in vain to make a handsome Retreat faced about and laying hold of ragged  Bess  who advanced in the Front of the Enemy she at one Blow felled her to the Ground The whole Army of the Enemy though near a hundred in Number seeing the Fate of their General gave back many Paces and retired behind a newdug Grave for the Churchyard was the Field of Battle where there was to be a Funeral that very Evening  Molly  pursued her Victory and catching up a Skull which lay on the Side of the Grave discharged it with such Fury that having hit a Taylor on the Head the two Skulls sent equally forth a hollow Sound at their Meeting and the Taylor took presently measure of his Length on the Ground where the Skulls lay side by side and it was doubtful which was the most valuable of the two  Molly  then taking a Thigh Bone in her Hand fell in among the flying Ranks and dealing her Blows with great Liberality neither Side overthrew the Carcass of many a mighty Heroe and Heroine  Recount O Muse the Names of those who fell  on this fatal Day First  Jemmy Tweedle  felt on his hinder Head the direful Bone Him the pleasant Bank of sweetly winding  Stower  had nourished where he first learnt the vocal Art with which wandering up and down at Wakes and Fairs he cheered the rural Nymphs and Swains when upon the Green they interweave the sprightly Dance while he himself stood fidling and jumping to his own Music How little now avails his Fiddle He thumps the verdant Floor with his Carcass Next old  Echepole  the Sowgelder received a Blow in his Forehead from our Amazonian Heroine and immediately fell to the Ground He was a swinging fat Fellow and fell with almost as much Noise as a House His Tobaccobox dropt at the same Time from his Pocket which  Molly  took up as lawful Spoils Then  Kate  of the Mill tumbled unfortunately over a Tombstone which catching hold of her ungartered Stocking inverted the Order of Nature and gave her Heels the Superiority to her Head  Betty Pippin  with young  Roger  her Lover fell both to the Ground Where O perverse Fate she salutes the Earth and he the Sky  Tom Freckle  the Smith's Son was the next Victim to her Rage He was an ingenious Workman and made excellent Pattins nay the very Pattin with which he was knocked down was his own Workmanship Had he been at that Time singing Psalms in the Church he would have avoided a broken Head Miss  Crow  the Daughter of a Farmer  John Giddish  himself a Farmer  Nan Slouch Esther Codling Will Spray Tom Bennet  the three Misses  Potter  whose Father keeps the Sign of the  Red Lion Betty Chambermaid Jack Ostler  and many others of inferior Note lay rolling among the Graves  Not that the strenuous Arm of  Molly  reached all these for many of them in their Flight overthrew each other  But now Fortune fearing she had acted out of Character  and had inclined too long to the same Side especially as it was the right Side hastily turned about For now Goody  Brown  whom  Zekiel Brown  cares  es in his Arms nor he alone but half the Parish besides so famous was she in the Fields of  Venus  nor indeed less in those of  Mars  The Trophies of both these her Husband always bore about on his Head and Face for if ever human Head did by its Horns display the amorous Glories of a Wife  Zekiel'  s did nor did his wellscratched Face less denote her Talents or rather Talons of a different Kind  No longer bore this Amazon the shameful Flight of her Party She stopt short and calling aloud to all who fled spoke as follows 'Ye  Somersetshire  Men or rather ye  Somersetshire  Women are ye not ashamed thus to fly from a single Woman but if no other will oppose her I myself and  Joan Top  here will have the Honour of the Victory' Having thus said she flew at  Molly Seagrim  and easily wrenched the Thigh Bone from her Hand at the same Time clawing off her Cap from her Head Then laying hold of the Hair of  Molly  with her Left Hand she attacked her so furiously in the Face with the Right that the Blood soon began to trickle from her Nose  Molly  was not idle this while She soon removed the Clout from the Head of Goody  Brown  and then fastening on her Hair with one Hand with the other she caused the same bloody Stream to issue forth from the Nostril of the Enemy  When each of the Combatants had bore off sufficient Spoils of Hair from the Head of her Antagonist the next Rage was against their Garments In this Attack they exerted so much Violence that in a very few Minutes they were both naked to the middle  It is lucky for the Women that the Seat of FistycuffWar is not the same with them as among Men but though they may seem a little to deviate from their Sex when they go forth to Battle yet I have observed  they never so far forget it as to assail the Bosom of each other where a few Blows would be fatal to most of them This I know some derive from their being of a more bloody Inclination than the Males On which Account they apply to the Nose as to the Part whence Blood may most easily be drawn but this seems a farfetched as well as illnatured Supposition  Goody  Brown  had great Advantage of  Molly  in this Particular for the former had indeed no Breasts her Bosom if it may be so called as well in Colour as in many other Properties exactly resembling an antient Piece of Parchment upon which any one might have drummed a considerable while without doing her any great Damage  Molly  besides her present unhappy Condition was differently formed in those Parts and might perhaps have attempted the Envy of  Brown  to give a her fatal Blow had not the lucky Arrival of  Tom Jones  at this Instant put an immediate End to the bloody Scene  This Accident was luckily owing to Mr  Square  for he Master  Blifil  and  Jones  had mounted their Horses after Church to take the Air and had ridden about a Quarter of a Mile when  Square  changing his Mind not idly but for a Reason which we shall unfold as soon as we have Leisure desired the young Gentlemen to ride with him another Way than they had at first purposed This Motion being complied with brought them of Necessity back again to the Churchyard  Master  Blifil  who rode first seeing such a Mob assembled and two Women in the Posture in which we left the Combatants stopt his Horse to enquire what was the Matter A Country Fellow scratching his Head answered him 'I don't know Measter un't I an't please your Honour here hath been a Vight I think between Goody  Brown  and  Mol  Seagrim'  'Who who cries  Tom'  but without waiting for an Answer having discovered the Feathres of his  Molly  through all the Discomposure in which they now were he hastily alighted turned  is Horse loose and leaping over the Wall ran to her She now first bursting into Tears told him how  arbarously she had been treated Upon which forgetting the Sex of Goody  Brown  or perhaps not  nowing it in his Rage for in reality she had no  eminine Appearance but a Petticoat which he might  ot observe he gave her a Lash or two with his Horsewhip and then flying at the Mob who were all accused by  Molly  he dealt his Blows so profusely in all Sides that unless I would again invoke the  luse which the goodnatured Reader may think a  ttle too hard upon her as she hath so lately been violently sweated it would be impossible for me to re  ount the Horsewhipping of that Day  Having scoured the whole Coast of the Enemy as well as any of  Homer's  Heroes ever did or as  Don Quixotte  or any Knight Errand in the World could  ave done he returned to  Molly  whom he found in a Condition which must give both me and my Reader Pain was it to be described here  Tom  raved like Madman beat his Breast tore his Hair stamped  n the Ground and vowed the utmost Vengeance on all who had been concerned He then pulled off his Coat and buttoned it round her put his Hat upon  er Head wiped the Blood from her Face as well as  e could with his Handkerchief and called out to the Servant to ride as fast as possible for a Sidesaddle or Pillion that he might carry her safe home  Master  Blifil  objected to the sending away the Servant as they had only one with them but as  Square  seconded the Order of  Jones  he was obliged to comply  The Servant returned in a very short Time with  he Pillion and  Molly  having collected her Rags as  well she could was placed behind him In which Manner she was carried home  Square Blifil  and  Jones  attending  Here  Jones  having received his Coat given her a sly Kiss and whispered her that he would return i  the Evening quitted his  Molly  and rode on after his Companions  CHAP IX  Containing Matters of no very peaceable Colour  MOLLY  had no sooner apparelled herself in her accustomed Rags than her Sisters began to fall violently upon her particularly her elder Sister who told her she was well enough served 'How had she the Assurance to wear a Gown which young Madam  Western  had given to Mother If one of us was to wear it I think' says she 'I myself have the best Right but I warrant you think it belongs to your Beauty I suppose you think yourself more handsomer than any of us' 'Hand her down the Bit of Glass from over the Cupboard' cries another I'd wash the Blood from my Face before I tauked of my Beauty' You'd better have minded what the Parson says' cries the eldest 'and not a harkened after Men Voke' 'Indeed Child and so she had' says the Mother sobbing 'she hath brought a disgrace upon us all She's the vurst of the Vamily that ever was a Whore' You need not upbraid me with that Mother cries  Molly  'you yourself was brought tobed of Sister there within a Week after you was married' 'Yes Hussy' answered the enraged Mother 'so I was and what was the mighty Matter of that I was made an honest Woman then and if you was to be made an honest Woman I should not be angry but you must have to doing with a Gentleman you nasty Slut you will have a Bastard Hussy you will and that I defy any one to say of me'  In this Situation  Black George  found his Family when he came home for the Purpose before mentioned As his Wife and three Daughters were all of them talking together and most of them crying it was some time before he could get an Opportunity  f being heard but as soon as such an Interval occurred acquainted the Company with what  Sophia  had said to him  Goody  Seagrim  then began to revile her Daughter afresh 'Here' says she 'you have brought us into a fine Quandary indeed What will Madam say to that big Belly Oh that ever I should live to see this Day  Molly  answered with great Spirit 'And what is this mighty Place which you have got for me Father' for he had not well understood the Phrase  sed by  Sophia  of being about her Person 'I suppose it is to be under the Cook but I shan't wash Dishes for any Body My Gentleman will provide better for me See what he hath given me this Afternoon he hath promised I shall never want Money and you shan't want Money neither Mother if you will hold your Tongue and know when you are well' And so saying she pulled out several Guineas and gave her Mother one of them  The good Woman no sooner felt the Gold within her Palm than her Temper began such is the Efficacy of that  Panacea  to be mollified 'Why Husband' says she 'would any but such a Blockhead as you not have enquired what Place this was before he had accepted it Perhaps as  Molly  says it may be in the Kitchen and truly I don't care my Daughter should be a Scullion Wench For poor as I am I am a Gentlewoman And thof I was obliged as my Father who was a Clergyman died worse than nothing and so could not give me a Shilling of  Potion  to undervalue myself by marrying a poor Man yet I would have you to know  I have a Spirit above all  them  Things Marry come up it would better become Madam  Western  to look at Home and remember who her own Grandfather was Some of my Family for ought I know might ride in their Coaches when the Grandfathers of some Voke walked avoot I warrant she fancies she did a mighty Matter when she sent us that old  Gownd  some of my Family would not have picked up such Rags in the Streets but poor People are always trampled uponThe Parish need not have been in such a Fluster with  Molly  You might have told them Child your Grandmother wore better Things new out of the Shop'  'Well but consider' cried  George  'What Answer shall I make to Madam' 'I don't know what Answer' says she 'You are always bringing your Family into one Quandary or other Do you remember when you shot the Partridge the Occasion of all our Misfortunes Did not I advise you never to go into Squire  Western'  s Manor Did not I tell you many a good Year ago what would come of it but you would have your own headstrong Ways yes you would you Villain'  Black George  was in the main a peaceable kind of Fellow and nothing  choleric nor rash  yet did he bear about him something of what the Antients called the  Irascible  and which his Wife if she had been endowed with much  Wisdom would have feared  He had long experienced that when the Storm grew very high Arguments were but Wind which served rather to increase than to abate it He was therefore seldom unprovided with a small Switch a Remedy of wonderful Force as he had often essayed and which the Word Villain served as a Hint for his applying  No sooner therefore had this Symptom appeared than he had immediate Recourse to the said Remedy which though as it is usual in all very efficacious  Medicines it at first seemed to heighten and inflame the Disease soon produced a total Calm and restored the Patient to perfect Ease and Tranquillity  This is however a kind of Horsemedicine which requires a very robust Constitution to digest and is therefore only proper for the Vulgar unless in one single Instance  viz  where Superiority of Birth breaks out in which Case we should not think it very improperly applied by any Husband whatever if the Application was not in itself so base that like certain Applications of the Physical Kind which need not be mentioned it so much degrades and contaminates the Hand employed in it that no Gentleman should endure the Thought of any Thing so low and detestable  The whole Family were soon reduced to a State of perfect Quiet For the Virtue of this Medicine like that of Electricity is often communicated through one Person to many others who are not touched by the Instrument To say the Truth as they both operate by Friction it may be doubted whether there is not something analogous between them of which Mr  Freke  would do well to enquire before he publishes the next Edition of his Book  A Council was now called in which after many Debates  Molly  still persisting that she would not go to Service it was at length resolved that Goody  Seagrim  herself should wait on Miss  Western  and endeavour to procure the Place for her elder Daughter who declared great Readiness to accept it but Fortune who seems to have been an Enemy of this little Family afterwards put a Stop to her Promotion  CHAP X  A Story told by Mr  Supple  the Curate The Penetration of Squire  Western  His great Love for his Daughter and the Return to it made by her  THE next Morning  Tom Jones  hunted with Mr  Western  and was at his Return invited by that Gentleman to Dinner  The lovely  Sophia  shone forth that Day with more Gaiety and Sprightliness than usual Her Battery was certainly levelled at our Heroe though I believe she herself scarce yet knew her own Intention but if she had any Design of charming him she now succeeded  Mr  Supple  the Curate of Mr  Allworthy'  s Parish made one of the Company He was a gooodnatured worthy Man but chiefly remarkable for his great Taciturnity at Table though his Mouth was never shut at it In short he had one of the best Appetites in the World However the Cloth was no sooner taken away than he always made sufficient Amends for his Silence For he was a very hearty Fellow and his Conversation was often entertaining never offensive  At his first Arrival which was immediately before the Entrance of the Roastbeef he had given an Intimation that he had brought some News with him and was beginning to tell that he came that Moment from Mr  Allworthy'  s when the Sight of the Roastbeef struck him dumb permitting him only to say Grace and to declare he must pay his Respect to the Baronet For so he called the Sirloin  When Dinner was over being reminded by  Sophia  of his News he began as follows 'I believe Lady your Ladyship observed a young Woman at Church yesterday at Evensong who was drest in one of your outlandish Garments I think I have seen  your Ladyship in such a one However in the Country such Dresses are  Raro avis in Terris nigro{que} simillima Cycno  That is Madam as much as to say  'A rare Bird upon the Earth and very like a' black Swan  'The Verse is in  Juvenal  but to return to what I was relating I was saying such Garments are rare Sights in the Country and perchance too it was thought the more rare Respect being had to the Person who wore it who they tell me is the Daughter of  Black George  your Worship's Gamekeeper whose Sufferings I should have opined might have taught him more Wit than to dress forth his Wenches in such gaudy Apparel She created so much Confusion in the Congregation that if Squire  Allworthy  had not silenced it it would have interrupted the Service For I was once about to stop in the Middle of the first Lesson Howbeit nevertheless after Prayer was over and I was departed home this occasioned a Battle in the Churchyard where amongst other Mischief the Head of a travelling Fidler was very much broken This Morning the Fidler came to Squire  Allworthy  for a Warrant and the Wench was brought before him The Squire was inclined to have compounded Matters when lo on a sudden the Wench appeared I ask your Ladyship Pardon to be as it were at the Eve of bringing forth a Bastard The Squire demanded of her who was the Father but she pertinaciously refused to make any Response So that he was about to make her Mittimus to  Bridewel'  when I departed'  'And is a Wench having a Bastard all your News Doctor cries  Western  'I thought it might have been some public Matter something about the Nation'  'I am afraid it is too common indeed' answered the Parson 'but I thought the whole Story altogether deserved commemorating As to National Matters your Worship knows them best My Concerns extend no farther than my own Parish'  'Why ay' says the Squire' 'I believe I do know a little Matter as you say but come  Tommy  drink about the Bottle stands with you'  Tom  begged to be excused for that he had particular Business and getting up from Table escaped the Clutches of the Squire who was rising to stop him and went off with very little Ceremony  The Squire gave him a good Curse at his Departure and then turning to the Parson he cried out 'I smoke it I smoke it  Tom  is certainly the Father of this Bastard' 'Zooks Parson you remember how he recommended the Veather o'her to medn un what a sly Bch 'tis Ay ay as sure as Twopence  Tom  is Veather of the Bastard'  'I should be very sorry for that' says the Parson 'Why sorry cries the Squire Where is the mighty Matter o't What I suppose dost pretend that thee hast never got a Bastard Pox more good Luck's thine for I warrant hast done  therefore  many's the good Time and often 'Your Worship is pleased to be jocular' answered the Parson but I do not only animadvert on the Sinfulness of the Action though that surely is to be greatly deprecated but I fear his Unrighteousness may injure him with Mr  Allworthy  And truly I must say though he hath the Character of being a little wild I never saw any Harm in the young Man nor can I say I have heard any save what your Worship now mentions I wish indeed he was a little more regular in his Responses at Church but altogether he seems'  'Ingenui vultus puer ingenui{que} pudoris  'That is a classical Line young Lady and being rendered into  English  is a A Lad of an ingenuous Countenance and of an ingenuous Modesty For this was a Virtue in great Repute both among the  Latins  and  Greeks  I must say the young Gentleman for so I think I may call him notwithstanding his Birth appears to me a very modest civil Lad and I should be sorry that he should do himself any Injury in Squire  Allworthy'  s Opinion'  'Poogh says the Squire 'Injury with  Allworthy  Why  Allworthy  loves a Wench himself Doth not all the Country know whose Son  Tom  is You must talk to another Person in that Manner I remember  Allworthy  at College'  'I thought' said the Parson 'he had never been at the University'  'Yes yes he was' says the Squire 'and many a Wench have we two had together As errant a Whoremaster as any within five Miles o'un No no It will do'n no Harm with he assure yourself or with any Body else Ask  Sophy  thereYou have not the worse Opinion of a young Fellow for getting a Bastard have you Girl No no the Women will like un the better for't'  This was a cruel Question to poor  Sophia  She had observed  Tom'  s Colour change at the Parson's Story and that with his hasty and abrupt Departure gave her sufficient Reason to think her Father's Suspicion not groundless Her Heart now at once discovered the great Secret to her which had been so long disclosing by little and little and she found herself highly interested in this Matter In such a Situation her Father's malapert Question rushing suddenly upon her produced some Symptoms which might have alarmed a Suspicious Heart but to do the Squire Justice that was not his Fault When she rose therefore from her Chair and told him a Hint from him was always sufficient to make her withdraw  he suffered her to leave the Room and then with great Gravity of Countenance remarked 'that it was better to see a Daughter overmodest than over forward' a Sentiment which was highly applauded by the Parson  There now ensued between the Squire and the Parson a most excellent political Discourse framed out of NewsPapers and political Pamphlets in which they made a Libation of four Bottles of Wine to the Good of their Country and then the Squire being fast asleep the Parson lighted his Pipe mounted his Horse and rode home  When the Squire had finished his Halfhour's Nap he summoned his Daughter to her Harpsichord but she begged to be excused that Evening on Account of a violent Headach This Remission was presently granted For indeed she seldom had Occasion to ask him twice as he loved her with such ardent Affection that by gratifying her he commonly conveyed the highest Gratification to himself She was really what he frequently called her his little Darling and she well deserved to be so For she returned all his Affection in the most ample Manner She had preserved the most inviolable Duty to him in all Things and this her Love made not only easy but so delightful that when one of her Companions laughed at her for placing so much Merit in such scrupulous Obedience as that young Lady called it  Sophia  answered 'You mistake me Madam if you think I value myself upon this Account For besides that I am barely discharging my Duty I am likewise pleasing myself I can truly say I have no Delight equal to that of contributing to my Father's Happiness and if I value myself my Dear it is on having this Power and not on executing it'  This was a Satisfaction however which poor  Sophia  was incapable of tasting this Evening She therefore not only desired to be excused from the Attendance  at the Harpsichord but likewise begged that he would suffer her to absent herself from Supper To this Request likewise the Squire agreed though not without some Reluctance for he scarce ever permitted her to be out of his Sight unless when he was engaged with his Horses Dogs or Bottle Nevertheless he yielded to the Desire of his Daughter though the poor Man was at the same Time obliged to avoid his own Company if I may so express myself by sending for a neighbouring Farmer to sit with him  CHAP XI  The narrow escape of  Molly Seagrim  with some Observations for which we have been forced to dive pretty deep into Nature  TOM JONES  had ridden one of Mr  Western'  s Horses that Morning in the Chace so that having no Horse of his own in the Squire's Stable he was obliged to go home on Foot This he did so expeditiously that he ran upwards of three Miles within the half Hour  Just as he arrived at Mr  Allworthy'  s outward Gate he met the Constable and Company with  Molly  in their Possession whom they were conducting to that House where the inferior Sort of People may learn one good Lesson  viz  Respect and Deference to their Superiors Since it must shew them the wide Distinction Fortune intends between those Persons who are to be corrected for their Faults and those who are not which Lesson if they do not learn I am afraid they very rarely learn any other good Lesson or improve their Morals at the House of Correction  A Lawyer may perhaps think Mr  Allworthy  exceeded his Authority a little in this Instance And to say the Truth I question as here was no regular  Information before him whether his Conduct was strictly regular However as his Intention was truly upright he ought to be excused in  Foro Conscientiae  since so many arbitrary Acts are daily committed by Magistrates who have not this Excuse to plead for themselves  Tom  was no sooner informed by the Constable whither they were proceeding indeed he pretty well guessed it of himself than he caught  Molly  in his Arms and embracing her tenderly before them all swore he would murder the first Man who offered to lay hold of her He bid her dry her Eyes and be comforted for wherever she went he would accompany her Then turning to the Constable who stood trembling with his Hat off he desired him in a very mild Voice to return with him for a Moment only to his Father so he now called  Allworthy  for he durst he said be assured that when he had alledged what he had to say in her Favour the Girl would be discharged  The Constable who I make no Doubt would have surrendered his Prisoner had  Tom  demanded her very readily consented to this Request So back they all went into Mr  Allworthy'  s Hall where  Tom  desired them to stay till his Return and then went himself in pursuit of the Good Man As soon as he was found  Tom  threw himself at his Feet and having begged a patient hearing confessed himself to be the Father of the Child of which  Molly  was then big He entreated him to have Compassion on the poor Girl and to consider if there was any Guilt in the case it lay principally at his Door  'If there is any Guilt in the Case' answered  Allworthy  warmly 'are you then so profligate and so abandoned a Libertine to doubt whether the breaking the Laws of God and Man the corrupting and ruining a poor Girl by Guilt I own indeed it  doth lie principally upon you and so heavy it is that you ought to expect it should crush you'  'Whatever may be my Fate says  Tom  let me succeed in my Intercessions for the poor Girl I consess I have corrupted her but whether she shall be ruined depends on you For Heaven's Sake Sir revoke your Warrant and do not send her to a Place which must unavoidably prove her Destruction'  Allworthy  bid him immediately call a Servant  Tom  answered there was no Occasion for he had luckily met them at the Gate and relying upon his Goodness had brought them back into his Hall where they now waited his final Resolution which upon his Knees he besought him might be in Favour of the Girl that she might be permitted to go home to her Parents and not be exposed to a greater Degree of Shame and Scorn than must necessarily fall upon her 'I know said he that is too much I know I am the wicked Occasion of it I will endeavour to make amends if possible and if you shall have hereafter the Goodness to forgive me I hope I shall deserve it'  Allworthy  hesitated some Time and at last said 'Well I will discharge my MittimusYou may send the Constable to me' He was instantly called discharged and so was the Girl  It will be believed that Mr  Allworthy  failed not to read  Tom  a very severe Lecture on this Occasion but it is unnecessary to insert it here as we have faithfully transcribed what he said to  Jenny Jones  in the first Book most of which may be applied to the Men equally with the Women So sensible an Effect had these Reproofs on the young Man who is no hardened Sinner that he retired into his own Room where he passed the Evening alone in much melancholy contemplation  Allworthy  was sufficiently offended by this Transgression of  Jones  for notwithstanding the Assertions of Mr  Western  it is certain this worthy Man had never indulged himself in any loose Pleasures with Women and greatly condemned the Vice of Incontinence in others Indeed there is much Reason to imagine that there was not the least Truth in what Mr  Western  affirmed especially as he laid the Scene of those Impurities at the University where Mr  Allworthy  had never been In fact the good Squire was a little too apt to indulge that Kind of Pleasanty which is generally called  Rhodomontade  but which may with as much Propriety be expressed by a much shorter Word and perhaps we too often supply the Use of this little Monosyllable by others since very much of what frequently passes in the World for Wit and Humour should in the strictest Purity of Language receive that short Appellation which in Conformity to the wellbred Laws of Custom I here suppress  But whatever Detestation Mr  Allworthy  had to this or to any other Vice he was not so blinded by it but that he could discern any Virtue in the guilty Person as clearly indeed as if there had been no Mixture of Vice in the same Character While he was angry therefore with the Incontinence of  Jones  he was no less pleased with the Honour and Honesty of his Selfaccusation He began now to form in his Mind the same Opinion of this young Fellow which we hope our Reader may have conceived And in ballancing his Faults with his Perfections the latter seemed rather to preponderate  It was to no Purpose therefore that  Thwackum  who was immediately charged by Mr  Blifl  with the Story unbended all his Rancour against poor  Tom Allworthy  gave a patient Hearing to these Invectives and then answered coldly 'That young Men of  Tom'  s Complexion were too generally addicted  to this Vice but he believed that Youth was sincerely affected with what he had said to him on the Occasion and he hoped he would not transgress again' So that as the Days of whipping were at an End the Tutor had no other Vent but his own Mouth for his Gall the usual poor Resource of impotent Revenge  But  Square  who was a less violent was a much more artful Man and as he hated  Jones  more perhaps than  Thwackum  himself so he contrived to do him more Mischief in the Mind of Mr  Allworthy  The Reader must remember the several little Incidents of the Partridge the Horse and the Bible which were recounted in the second Book By all which  Jones  had rather improved than injured the Affection which Mr  Allworthy  was inclined to entertain for him The same I believe must have happened to him with every other Person who hath any Idea of Friendship Generosity and Greatness of Spirit that is to say who hath any Traces of Goodness in his Mind  Square  himself was not unacquainted with the true Impression which those several Instances of Goodness had made on the excellent Heart of  Allworthy  for the Philosopher very well knew what Virtue was though he was not always perhaps steady in its Pursuit but as for  Thwackum  from what Reason I will not determine no such Thoughts ever entered into his Head He saw  Jones  in a bad Light and he imagined  Allworthy  saw him in the same but that he was resolved from Pride and Stubbornness of Spirit not to give up the Boy whom he had once cherished since by so doing he must tacitly acknowledge that his former Opinion of him had been wrong  Square  therefore embraced this Opportunity of injuring  Jones  in the tenderest Part by giving a very bad Turn to all these beforementioned Occurrences  'I am sorry Sir said he 'to own I have been deceived  as well as yourself I could not I confess help being pleased with what I ascribed to the Motive of Friendship though it was carried to an Excess and all Excess is faulty and vicious but in this I made Allowance for Youth Little did I suspect that the Sacrifice of Truth which we both imagined to have been made to Friendship was in reality a Prostitution of it to a depraved and debauched Appetite You now plainly see whence all the seeming Generosity of this young Man to the Family of the Gamekeeper proceeded He supported the Father in order to corrupt the Daughter and preserved the Family from starving to bring one of them to Shame and Ruin This is Friendship this is Generosity As Sir  Richard Steele  says Gluttons who give high Prices for Delicacies are very worthy to be called generous In short I am resolved from this Instance never to give Way to the Weakness of Human Nature more nor to think any thing Virtue which doth not exactly quadrate with the unerring Rule of Right'  The Goodness of  Allworthy  had prevented those Considerations from occurring to himself yet were they too plausible to be absolutely and hastily rejected when laid before his Eyes by another Indeed what  Square  had said sunk very deeply into his Mind and the Uneasiness which it there created was very visible to the other though the good Man would not acknowledge this but made a very slight Answer and forcibly drove off the Discourse to some other Subject It was well perhaps for poor  Tom  that no such Suggestions had been made before he was pardoned for they certainly stamped in the Mind of  Allworthy  the first bad Impression concerning  Jones  CHAP XII  Containing much clearer Matters but which flow from the same Fountain with those in the preceding Chapter  THE Reader will be pleased I believe to return with me to  Sophia  She passed the Night after we saw her last in no very agreeable Manner Sleep befriended her but little and Dreams less In the Morning when Mrs  Honour  her Maid attended her at the usual Hour she was found already up and drest  Persons who live two or three Miles Distance in the Country are considered as next Door Neighbours and Transactions at the one House fly with incredible Celerity to the other Mrs  Honour  therefore had heard the whole Story of  Molly'  s Shame which she being of a very communicative Temper had no sooner entered the Apartment of her Mistress than she began to relate in the following Manner  'La Ma'am what doth your La'ship think the Girl that your La'ship saw at Church on  Sunday  whom you thought so handsome though you would not have thought her so handsome neither if you had seen her nearer but to be sure she hath been carried before the Justice for being big with Child She seemed to me to look like a confident Slut and to be sure she hath laid the Child to young Mr  Jones  And all the Parish says Mr  Allworthy  is so angry with young Mr  Jones  that he won't see him To be sure one can't help pitying the poor young Man and yet he doth not deserve much Pity neither for demeaning himself with such Kind of Trumpery Yet he is so pretty a Gentleman I should be sorry to have him turned out of Doors I dares to swear the Wench was as willing as he for she was always a forward Kind of Body And  when Wenches are so coming young Men are not so much to be blamed neither for to be sure they do no more than what is natural Indeed it is beneath them to meddle with such dirty Draggletails and whatever happens to them it is good enough for them And yet to be sure the vile Baggages are most in Fault I wishes with all my Heart they were well to be whipped the Cart's Tail for it is Pity they should be the Ruin of a pretty young Gentleman and no body can deny but that Mr  Jones  is one of the most handsomest young Men that ever'  She was running on thus when  Sophia  with a more peevish Voice than she had ever spoken to her in before cried 'Prithee why do'st thou trouble me with all this Stuff What Concern have I in what Mr  Jones  doth I suppose you are all alike And you seem to me to be angry it was not your own Case'  'I Ma'am' answered Mrs  Honour  I am sorry your Ladyship should have such an Opinion of me I am sure nobody can say any such thing of me All the young Fellows in the World may go to the  Divil  for me Because I said he was a handsome Man Every body says it as well as ITo be sure I never thought as it was any Harm to say a young Man was handsome but to be sure I shall never think him so any more now for handsome is that' handsome does A Beggar Wench'  'Stop thy Torrent of Impertinence 'cries  Sophia  and see whether my Father wants me at Breakfast'  Mrs  Honour  then flung out of the Room muttering much to herselfof which'Many come up I assure you' was all that could be plainly distinguished  Whether Mrs  Honour  really deserved that Suspicion of which her Mistress gave her a Hint is a Matter which we cannot in dulge our Reader's Curiosity  by resolving We will however make him amends in disclosing what passed in the Mind of  Sophia  The Reader will be pleased to recollect that a secret Affection for Mr  Jones  had insensibly stolen into the Bosom of this young Lady That it had there grown to a pretty great Height before she herself had discovered it When she first began to perceive is Symptoms the Sensations were so sweet and pleasing that she had not Resolution sufficient to check or repel them and thus she went on cherishing a Passion of which she never once considered the Consequences  This Incident relating to  Molly  first opened her Eyes She now first perceived the Weakness of which she had been guilty and though it caused the utmost Perturbation in her Mind yet it had the Effect of other nauseous Physic and for the Time expelled her Distemper Its Operation indeed was most wonderfully quick and in the short Interval while her Maid was absent so entirely removed all Symptoms that when Mrs  Honour  returned with a Summons from her Father she was become perfectly easy and had brought herself to a thorough Indifference for Mr  Jones  The Diseases of the Mind do in almost every Particular imitate those of the Body For which Reason we hope That learned Faculty for whom we have so profound a Respect will pardon us the violent Hands we have been necessitated to lay on several Words and Phrases which of Right belong to them and without which our Descriptions must have been often unintelligible  Now there is no one Circumstance in which the Distempers of the Mind bear a more exact Analogy to those which are called Bodily than that Aptness which both have to a Relapse This is plain in the violent Diseases of Ambition and Avarice I have known Ambition when cured at Court by frequent  Disappointments which are the only Physic for it to break out again in a Contest of Foreman of the Grand Jury at an Assizes and have heard of a Man who had so far conquered Avarice as to give away many a Sixpence that comforted himself at last on his Deathbed by making a crafty and advantageous Bargain concerning his ensuing Funeral with an Undertaker who had married his only Child  In the Affair of Love which out of strict Conformity with the Stoic Philosophy we shall here treat as a Disease this Proneness to relapse is no less conspicuous Thus it happened to poor  Sophia  upon whom the very next Time she saw young  Jones  all the former Symptoms returned and from that Time cold and hot Fits alternately seized her Heart  The Situation of this young Lady was very different from what it had ever been before That Passion which had formerly been so exquisitely delicious became now a Scorpion in her Bosom She resisted it therefore with her utmost Force and summoned every Argument her Reason which was surprizingly strong for her Age could suggest to subdue and expel it In this she so far succeeded that she began to hope from Time and Absence a perfect Cure She resolved therefore to avoid  Tom Jones  as much as possible for which Purpose she began to conceive a Design of visiting her Aunt to which she made no Doubt of obtaining her Father's Consent  But Fortune who had other Designs in her Head put an immediate Stop to any such Proceeding by introducing an Accident which will be related in the next Chapter  CHAP XIII  A dreadful Accident which befel  Sophia  The gallant Behaviour of  Jones  and the more dreadful Consequence of that Behaviour to the young Lady with a short Digression in Favour of the Female Sex  MR  Western  grew every Day fonder and fonder of  Sophia  insomuch that his beloved Dogs themselves almost gave Place to her in his Affections but as he could not prevail on himself to abandon these he contrived very cunningly to enjoy their Company together with that of his Daughter by insisting on her riding a hunting with him  Sophia  to whom her Father's Word was a Law readily complied with his Desires though she had not the least Delight in a Sport which was of too rough and masculine a Nature to suit with her Disposition She had however another Motive beside her Obedience to accompany the old Gentleman in the Chace for by her Presence she hoped in some Measure to restrain his Impetuosity and to prevent him from so frequently exposing his Neck to the utmost Hazard  The strongest Objection was that which would have formerly been an Inducement to her namely the frequent Meeting with young  Jones  whom she had determined to avoid but as the End of the hunting Season now approached she hoped by a short Absence with her Aunt to reason herself entirely out of her unfortunate Passion and had not any Doubt of being able to meet him in the Field the subsequent Season without the least Danger  On the second Day of her Hunting as she was returning from the Chase and was arrived within a little Distance from Mr  Western'  s House her Horse whose mettlesome Spirit required a better Rider fell suddenly to prancing and capering in such a Manner that she was in the most imminent Peril of falling  Tom  Jones  who was at a little Distance behind saw this and immediately galloped up to her Assistance As soon as he came up he immediately leapt from his own Horse and caught hold of her's by the Bridle The unruly Beast presently reared himself an End on his hind Legs and threw his Burthen from his Back and  Jones  caught her in his Arms  She was so affected with the Fright that she was not immediately able to satisfy  Jones  who was very sollicitous to know whether she had received any Hurt She soon after however recovered her Spirits assured him she was safe and thanked him for the Care he had taken of her  Jones  answered 'If I have preserved you Madam I am sufficiently repaid for I promise you I would have secured you from the least Harm at the Expence of a much greater Misfortune to myself than I have suffered on this Occasion'  'What Misfortune' replied  Sophia  eagerly 'I hope you have come to no Mischief'  'Be not concerned Madam' answered  Jones  'Heaven be praised you have escaped so well considering the Danger you was in If I have broke my Arm I consider it as a Trifle in Comparison of what I feared upon your Account'  Sophia  then screamed out 'Broke your Arm Heaven forbid'  'I am afraid I have Madam' says  Jones  'but I beg you will suffer me first to take Care of you I have a Righthand yet at your Service to help you into the next Field where we have but a very little Walk to your Father's House'  Sophia  seeing his left Arm dangling by his Side while he was using the other to lead her no longer doubted of the Truth She now grew much paler than her Fears for herself had made her before All her Limbs were seized with a Trembling insomuch that  Jones  could scarce support her and as her Thoughts  were in no less Agitation she could not refrain from giving  Jones  a Look so full of Tenderness that it almost argued a stronger Sensation in her Mind than even Gratitude and Pity united can raise in the gentlest female Bosom without the Assistance of a third more powerful Passion  Mr  Western  who was advanced at some Distance when this Accident happened was now returned as were the rest of the Horsemen  Sophia  immediately acquainted them with what had befallen  Jones  and begged them to take Care of him Upon which  Western  who had been much alarmed by meeting his Daughter's Horse without its Rider and was now overjoyed to find her unhurt cried out 'I am glad it is no worse if  Tom  hath broken his Arm we will get a Joiner to mend un again'  The Squire alighted from his Horse and proceeded to his House on Foot with his Daughter and  Jones  An impartial Spectator who had met them on the Way would on viewing their several Countenances have concluded  Sophia  alone to have been the Object of Compassion For as to  Jones  he exulted in having probably saved the Life of the young Lady at the Price only of a broken Bone and Mr  Western  though he was not unconcerned at the Accident which had befallen  Jones  was however delighted in a much higher Degree with the fortunate escape of his Daughter  The Generosity of  Sophia'  s Temper construed this Behaviour of  Jones  into great Bravery and it made a deep Impression on her Heart For certain it is that there is no one Quality which so generally recommends Men to Women as this proceeding if we believe the common Opinion from that natural Timidity of the Sex which is says Mr  Osborne  so great' that a Woman is the most cowardly of all 'the Creatures God ever made' A Sentiment more remarkable for its Bluntness than for its Truth  Aristotle  in his Politics doth them I believe more Justice when he says  'The Modesty and Fortitude of Men differ from those Virtues in Women for the Fortitude which becomes a Woman would be Cowardice in a Man and the Modesty which becomes a Man would be Pertness in a Woman'  Nor is there perhaps more of Truth in the Opinion of those who derive the Partiality which Women are inclined to shew to the Brave from this Excess of their Fear Mr  Bayle  I think in his Article of  Helen  imputes this and with greater Probability to their violent Love of Glory for the Truth of which we have the Authority of him who of all others saw farthest into human Nature and who introduces the Heroine of his Odyssey the great Pattern of matrimonal Love and Constancy assigning the glory of her Husband as the only Source of her Affections towards him  The  English  Reader will not find this in the Poem For the Sentiment is entirely left out in the Translation  However this be certain it is that the Accident operated very strongly on  Saphia  and indeed after much Enquiry into the Matter I am inclined to believe that at this very Time the charming  Sophia  made no less Impression on the Heart of  Jones  to say Truth he had for some Time become sensible of the irrestible Power of her Charms  CHAP XIV  The Arrival of a Surgeon His Operations and a long Dialogue between  Sophia  and her Maid  WHEN they arrived in Mr  Western'  s Hall  Sophia  who had totter'd along with much Difficulty sunk down in a Chair but by the Assistance of Hartshorn and Water she was prevented from fainting away and had pretty well recovered her Spirits when the Surgeon who was sent for to  Jones  appeared Mr  Western  who imputed these Symptoms in his Daughter to her Fall advised her to be  resently blooded by way of Prevention In this Opinion he was seconded by the Surgeon who gave  o many Reasons for bleeding and quoted so many Cases where Persons had miscarried for want of it  hat the Squire became very importunate and indeed  nsisted peremtorily that his Daughter should be blooded  Sophia  soon yielded to the Commands of her Father though entirely contrary to her own Inclinations For she suspected I believe less Danger from the Fright than either the Squire or the Surgeon She  hen stretched out her beautiful Arm and the Operator began to prepare for his Work  While the Servants were busied in providing Materials the Surgeon who imputed the Backwardness which had appeared in  Sophia  to her Fears began to comfort her with Assurances that there was not the  east Danger for no Accident he said could ever happen in Bleeding but from the monstrous Ignorance of Pretenders to Surgery which he pretty plainly insinuated was not at present to be apprehended  Sophia  declared she was not under the least Apprehension adding if you open an Artery I promise you I'll forgive you 'Will you' cries  Western  'Dn me if I will if he does the least Mischief dn me if I don't ha' the Heart's Blood o'un out' The Surgeon assented to bleed her upon these Conditions and then proceeded to his Operation which he performed with as much Dexterity as he had promised and as much Quickness For he took but little Blood from her saying it was much safer to bleed again and again than to take away too much at once  Sophia  when her Arm was bound up retired For she was not willing nor was it perhaps strictly decent to be present at the Operation on  Jones  Indeed  one Objection which she had to Bleeding tho she did not make it was the Delay which it would occasion to dressing the broken Bone For  Western  when  Sophia  was concerned had no Consideration but for her and as for  Jones  himself he 'sat like Patience on a Monument smiling at Grief' T  say the Truth when he saw the Blood springing from the lovely Arm of  Sophia  he scarce thought of what had happened to himself  The Surgeon now ordered his Patient to be stript t  his Shirt and then entirely baring the Arm he began to stretch and examine it in such a Manner that th  Tortures he put him to caused  Jones  to make several wry Faces which the Surgeon observing great wondered at crying 'What is the Matter Sir am sure it is impossible I should hurt you' And the holding forth the broken Arm he began a long and very learned Lecture of Anatomy in which simpl  and double Fractures were most accurately considered and the several Ways in which  Jones  might have bro…ken his Arm were discussed with proper Annotation  shewing how many of these would have been better and how many worse than the present Case  Having at length finish'd his laboured Harangu  with which the Audience tho' it had greatly raise  their Attention and Admiration were not much edi…fied as they really understood not a single Syllable o  all he had said he proceeded to Business which h  was more expeditious in finishing than he had been in beginning  Jones  was then ordered into a Bed which Mr  Western  compelled him to accept at his own House and Sentence of WaterGruel was passed upon him  Among the good Company which had attende  in the Hall during the Bonesetting Mrs  Honour  w  one who being summoned to her Mistress as soo  as it was over and asked by her how the young Gen+tleman did presently launched into extravagant Praise  on the  Magnimity  as she called it of his Behaviour which she said 'was so charming in so pretty a 'Creature' She then burst forth into much warmer Encomiums on the Beauty of his Person enumerating many Particulars and ending with the Whiteness of his Skin  This Discourse had an Effect on  Sophia'  s Countenance which would not perhaps have escaped the Observance of the sagacious Waitingwoman had she once looked her Mistress in the Face all the Time she was speaking but as a Lookingglass which was most commodiously placed opposite to her gave her an Opportunity of surveying those Features in which of all others she took most Delight so she had not once removed her Eyes from that amiable Object during her whole Speech  Mrs  Honour  was so entirely wrapped up in the Subject on which she exercised her Tongue and the Object before her Eyes that she gave her Mistress Time to conquer her Confusion which having done she smiled on her Maid and told her 'She was certainly in Love with this young Fellow' 'I in Love' Madam answers she 'upon my Word Ma'am I assure you Ma'am upon my Soul Ma'am I am not' 'Why if you was' cries her Mistress 'I see no Reason that you should be ashamed of it for he is certainly a pretty FellowYes Ma'am answered the other 'That he is the most handsomest Man I ever saw in my Life Yes to be sure that he is and as your Ladyship says I don't know why I should be ashamed of loving him though he is my Betters To be sure gentle Folks are but Flesh and Blood no more than us Servants Besides as for Mr  Jones  tho' Squire  Allworthy  hath made a Gentleman of him he was not so good as myself by Birth thof I am a poor Body I am an honest Person's Child and my Father and Mother were married which is more  than some People can say as high as they hold their Heads Marry come up I assure you my dirty Cousin thof his Skin be so white and to be sure it is the most whitest that ever was seen I am a Christian as well as he and nobody can say tha  I am base born my grandfather was a Clergy man  This is the second Person of low Condition who we have recorded in this History to have sprung from t  Clergy It is to be hoped such Instances will in futu  Ages when some Provision is made for the Families  the inferior Clergy appear stranger than they can  thought at present  and would have been very angry I believe to have thought any of his Family should have tak+en up with  Molly Seagrim'  s dirty Leavings'  Perhaps  Sophia  might have suffered her Maid to ru  on in this Manner from wanting sufficient Spirits t  stop her Tongue which the Reader may probably conjecture was no very easy Task For certain  there were some Passages in her Speech which wer  far from being agreeable to the Lady However she now checked the Torrent as there seemed n  End of its Flowing 'I wonder' says she 'a  your Assurance in daring to talk thus of one of m  Father's Friends As to the Wench I order yo  never to mention her Name to me And wit  Regard to the young Gentleman's Birth those wh  can say nothing more to his Disadvantage may a  well be silent on that Head as I desire you will b  for the future'  'I am sorry I have offended your Ladyship' an+swered Mrs  Honour  'I am sure I hate  Molly Sea+grim  as much as your Ladyship can and as for a busing 'Squire  Jones  I can call all the Servants  the House to witness that whenever any Talk ha  been about Bastards I have always taken his Part For which of you' says I to the Footmen 'wou  not be a Bastard if he could to be made a Gentleman of and' says I 'I am sure he is a very fine Gentleman and he hath one of the whitest Hands in the World For to be sure so he hath' and' says 'one of the sweetest temperedest best naturedest Men in the World he is' and says I 'all the Servants and Neighbours all round the Country loves him And to be sure I could tell your Ladyship something but that I am afraid it would offend you''What could you tell me  Honour'  says  Sophia  'Nay Ma'am to sure he meant nothing by it therefore I would not have your Ladyship be offended''Prithee tell me' says  Sophia'  I will know it this Instant' Why Ma'am' answered Mrs  Honour  'he came into the Room one Day last Week when I was at Work and there lay your Ladyship's Muff on a Chair and to be sure he put his Hands into it that very Muff your Ladyship gave me but yesterday La' says I Mr  Jones  you will stretch my Lady's Muff and spoil it but he still kept his Hands in it and then he kissed itto be sure I hardly ever saw such a Kiss in my Life as he gave it''I suppose he did not know it was mine' replied  Sophia  'Your Ladyship shall hear Ma'am He kissed it again and again and said it was the prettiest Muff in the World' La Sir' says I 'you have seen it a hundred Times'Yes Mrs  Honour'  cry'd he 'but who can see any thing beautiful in the Presence of your Lady but herself Nay that's not all neither but I hope your Ladyship won't be offended for to be sure he meant nothing One Day as your Ladyship was playing on the Harpsicord to my Master Mr  Jones  was sitting in the next Room and methought he looked melancholy La' says I 'Mr  Jones  what's the Matter A Penny for your Thoughts' says I 'Why Hussy' says he starting up from a Dream 'what can I be thinking of when that Angel  your Mistress is playing' And then squeezing me by the Hand'Oh Mrs  Honour'  says he how happy will that Man be'and then he sighed upon my Troth his Breath is as sweet as a Nosegaybut to be sure he meant no Harm by it So I hope your Ladyship will not mention a Word For he gave me a Crown never to mention it and made me swear upon a Book but I believe indeed it was not the Bible'  Till something of a more beautiful Red than Vermilion be found out I shall say nothing of  Sophia'  s Colour on this Occasion  'Honour'  says she 'Iif you will not mention this any more to me nor to any Body else I will not betray youI mean I will not be angry but I am afraid of your Tongue Why my Girl will you give it such Liberties' Nay Ma'am' answered she to be sure I would sooner cut out my Tongue than offend your Ladyshipto be sure I shall never mention a Word that your Ladyship would not have me'Why I would not have you mention this any more' said  Sophia  'for it may come to my Father's Ears and he would be angry with Mr  Jones  tho' I really believe as you say he meant nothing I should be very angry myself if I imagined''Nay Ma'am' says  Honour  'I protest I believe he meant nothing I thought he talked as if he was out of his Senses nay he said he believed he was beside himself when he had spoken the Words' Ay Sir says I 'I believe so too' Yes says he  'Honour  but I ask your Ladyship's Pardon I could tear my Tongue out for offending you' 'Go on' says  Sophia  'you may mention any Thing you have not told me before' 'Yes  Honour'  says he this was some time afterwards when he gave me the Crown 'I am neither such a coxcomb or such a Villain as to think of her in any other  Delight  but as my Goddess as such I will always worship  and adore her while I have Breath This was all Ma'am I will be sworn to the best of my Remembrance I was in a Passion with him myself till I found he meant no Harm Indeed  Honour  says  Sophia  I believe you have a real Affection for me I was provoked the other Day when I gave you Warning but if you have a Desire to stay with me you shall To be sure Ma'am answered Mrs  Honour  I shall never desire to part with your Ladyship' To be sure I almost cried my Eyes out when you gave me Warning It would be very ungrateful in me to desire to leave your Ladyship because as why I should never get so good a Place again I am sure I would live and die with your Ladyshipfor as poor Mr  Jones  said happy is the Man  Here the Dinnerbell interrupted a Conversation which had wrought such an Effect on  Sophia  that she was perhaps more obliged to her bleeding in the Morning than she at the time had apprehended she should be As to the present Situation of her Mind I shall adhere to a Rule of  Horace  by not attempting to describe it from despair of Success Most of my Readers will suggest it easily to themselves and the few who cannot would not understand the Picture or at least would deny it to be natural if ever so well drawn  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK V  Containing a short Portion of Time somewhat longer than Half a Year  CHAP I  Of  THE SERIOUS  in writing and for what Purpose it is introduced  PEradventure there may be no Parts in this prodigious Work which will give the Reader less Pleasure in the perusing than those which have given the Author the greatest Pains in composing Among these probably may be reckoned those initial Essays which we have perfixed to the historical Matter contained in every Book and which we have determined to be essentially necessary to this kind of Writing of which we have set ourselves at the Head  For this our Determination we do not hold ourselves strictly bound to assign any Reason it being abundantly sufficient that we have laid it down as a Rule necessary to be observed in all Prosaicomiepic Writing Who ever demanded the Reasons of that nice  Unity of Time or Place which is now established to be so essential to dramatick Poetry What Critic hath been ever asked why a Play may not contain two Days as well as one or why the Audience provided they travel like Electors without any Expence may not be wafted Fifty Miles as well as five Hath any Commentator well accounted for the Limitation which an antient Critic had set to the Drama which he will have contain neither more nor less than five Acts or hath any one living attempted to explain what the modern Judges of our Theatres mean by that Word  low  by which they have happily succeeded in banishing all Humour from the Stage and have made the Theatre as dull as a DrawingRoom Upon all these Occasions the World seemed to have embraced a Maxim of our Law viz  Cuicun{que} in Arte sua perito credendum est  For it seems perhaps difficult to conceive that any one should have enough of Impudence to lay down dogmatical Rules in any Art or Science without the least Foundation In such Cases therefore we are apt to conclude there are sound and good Reasons at the Bottom tho' we are unfortunately not able to see so far  Now in Reality the World have paid too great a Compliment to Critics and have imagined them Men of much greater Profundity than they really are From this Complaisance the Critics have been emboldened to assume a Dictatorial Power and have so far succeeded that they are now become the Masters and have the Assurance to give Laws to those Authors from whose Predecessors they originally received them  The Critrc rightly considered is no more than the Clerk whose Office is to transcribe the Rules and Laws laid down by those great Judges whose vast Strength of Genius hath placed them in the Light of Legislators in the several Sciences over which  they presided This Office was all which the Critics of old aspired to nor did they ever dare to advance a Sentence without supporting it by the Authority of the Judge from whence it was borrowed  But in Process of Time and in Ages of Ignorance the Clerk began to invade the Power and assume the Dignity of his Master The Laws of Writing were no longer founded on the Practice of the Author but on the Dictates of the Critic The Clerk became the Legislator and those very peremptorily gave Laws whose Business it was at first only to transcribe them  Hence arose an obvious and perhaps an unavoidable Error For these Critics being Men of shallow Capacities very easily mistook mere Form for Substance They acted as a Judge would who should adhere to the lifeless Letter of Law and reject the Spirit Little Circumstances which were perhaps accidental in a great Author were by these Critics considered to constitute his chief Merit and transmitted as Essentials to be observed by all his Successors To these Encroachments Time and Ignorance the two great Supporters of Imposture gave Authority and thus many Rules for good Writing have been established which have not the least Foundation in Truth or Nature and which commonly serve for no other Purpose than to crub and restrain Genius in the same Manner as it would have restrained the Dancingmaster had the many excellent Treatises on that Art laid it down as an essential Rule that every Man must dance in Chains  To avoid therefore all Imputation of laying down a Rule for Posterity founded only on the Authority of  ipse dixit  for which to say the Truth we have not the profoundest Veneration we shall here wave the Privilege above contended for and proceed to lay before the Reader the Reasons which have induced us to intersperse these several digressive Essays in the Course of this Work  And here we shall of Necessity be led to open a new Vein of Knowledge which if it hath been discovered hath not to our Rememberance been wrought on by any antient or modern Writer This Vein is no other than that of Contrast which runs through all the Works of the Creation and may probably have a large Share in constituting in us the Idea of all Beauty as well natural as artificial For what demonstrates the Beauty and Excellence of any thing but its Reverse Thus the Beauty of Day and that of Summer is set off by the Horrors of Night and Winter And I believe if it was possible for a Man to have seen only the two former he would have a very imperfect Idea of their Beauty  But to avoid too serious an Air Can it be doubted but that the finest Woman in the World would lose all Benefit of her Charms in the Eye of a Man who had never seen one of another Cast The Ladies themselves seem so sensible of this that they are all industrious to procure Foils nay they will become Foils to themselves for I have observed at  Bath  particularly that they endeavour to appear as ugly as possible in the Morning in order to set off that Beauty which they intend to shew you in the Evening  Most Artists have this Secret in Practice tho' some perhaps have not much studied the Theory The Jeweller knows that the finest Brilliant requires a Foil and the Painter by the Contrast of his Figures often acquires great Applause  A great Genius among us will illustrate this Matter fully I cannot indeed range him under any general Head of common Artists as he hath a Title to be placed among those  Inventas qui vitam excoluere per Artes  Who by invented Arts have Life improv'd  I mean here the Inventor of that most exquisite Entertainment called the  English  Pantomime  This Entertainment consisted of two Parts which the Inventor distinguished by the Names of  the Serious  and the  Comic  The Serious exhibited a certain Number of Heathen Gods and Heroes who were certainly the worst and dullest Company into which an Audience was ever introduced and which was a Secret known to few were actually intended so to be in order to contrast the  Comic  Part of the Entertainment and to display the Tricks of Harlequin to the better Advantage  This was perhaps no very civil Use of such Personages but the Contrivance was nevertheless ingenious enough and had its Effect And this will now plainly appear if instead of  Serious  and  Comic  we supply the Words  Duller  and  Dullest  for the  Comic  was certainly duller than any thing before shewn on the Stage and could only be set off by that superlative Degree of Dulness which composed the Serious So intolerably serious indeed were these Gods and Heroes that Harlequin tho' the  English  Gentleman of that Name is not at all related to the  French  Family for he is of a much more serious Disposition was always welcome on the Stage as he relieved the Audience from worse Company  Judicious Writers have always practised this Art of Contrast with great Success I have been surprized that  Horace  should cavil at this Art in  Homer  but indeed he contradicts himself in the very next Line  Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat  Homerus  Verum Operi longo fas est obripere Somnum  I grieve if e'er great  Homer  chance to sleep  Yet Slumbers on long Works have right to creep  For we are not here to understand as perhaps some have that an Author actually falls asleep while he is writing It is true that Readers are too apt to be so overtaken but if the Work was as long as any of  Oldmixon  the Author himself is too well entertained  to be subject to the least Drowsiness He is as Mr  Pope  observes  Sleepless himself to give his Readers Sleep  To say the Truth these soporific Parts are so many Scenes of  Serious  artfully interwoven in order to contrast and set off the rest and this is the true Meaning of a late facetious Writer who told the Public that whenever he was dull they might be assured there was a Design in it  In this Light then or rather in this Darkness I would have the Reader to consider these initial Essays And after this Warning if he shall be of Opinion that he can find enough of Serious in other Parts of this history he may pass over these in which we profess to be laboriously dull and begin the following Books at the second Chapter  CHAP II  In which Mr  Jones  receives many friendly Visits during his Confinement with some fine Touches of the Passion of Love scarce visible to the naked Eye  TOM JONES  had many Visitors during his Confinement tho' some perhaps were not very agreeable to him Mr  Allworthy  saw him almost every Day but tho' he pitied  Tom'  s Sufferings and greatly approved the gallant Behaviour which had occasioned them yet he thought this was a favourable Opportunity to bring him to a sober Sense of his indiscreet Conduct and that wholsome Advice for that Purpose could never be applied at a more proper Season than at the present when the Mind was softened by Pain and Sickness and alarmed by Danger and when its Attention was unembarrassed with those turbulent Passions which engage us in the Pursuit of Pleasure  At all Seasons therefore when the good Man was alone with the Youth especially when the latter was  totally at Ease he took Occasian to remind him of his former Miscarriages but in the mildest and tenderest Manner and only in order to introduce the Caution which he prescribed for his future Behaviour 'on which alone 'he assured him 'would depend his own Felicity and the Kindness which he might yet promise himself to receive at the Hands of his Father by Adoption unless he should hereafter forfeit his Good Opinion For as to what had past' he said 'it should be all forgotten and forgiven He therefore advised him to make a good Use of this Accident that so in the End it might prove a Visitation for his own Good'  Thwackum  was likewise pretty assiduous in his Visits and he too considered a sick Bed to be a convenient Scene for Lectures His Stile however was more severe than Mr  Allworthy'  s He told his Pupil 'that he ought to look on his broken Limb as a Judgment from Heaven on his Sins That it would become him to be daily on his Knees pouring forth Thanksgivings that he had broken his Arm only and not his Neck which latter' he said 'was very probably reserved for some future Occasion and that perhaps not very remote For his Part' he said 'he had often wondered some Judgment had not overtaken him before but it might be perceived by this that divine Punishments tho' slow are always sure' Hence likewise he advised him 'to foresee with equal Certainty the greater Evils which 'vere yet behind and which were as sure as this of overtaking him in his State of Reprobacy These are' said he 'to be averted only by such a thorough and sincere Repentance as is not to be expected or hoped for from one so abandoned in his Youth and whose Mind I am afraid is totally corrupted It is my Duty however to exhort you to this Repentance tho' I too well know all Exhortations will be vain and fruitless But  liberavi Animam meam  I can  accuse my own Conscience of no Neglect tho' it is at the same time with the utmost Concern I see you travelling on to certain Misery in this World and to as certain Damnation in the next'  Square  talked in a very different Strain He said 'such Accidents as a Broken Bone were below the Consideration of a wise Man That it was abundantly sufficient to reconcile the Mind to any of these Mischances to reflect that they are liable to befal the wisest of Mankind and are undoubtedly for the Good of the whole' He said 'it was a mere Abuse of Words to call those Things Evils in which there was no moral Unfitness that Pain which was the worst Consequence of such Accidents was the most contemptible thing in the World' with more of the like Sentences extracted out of the Second Book of  Tully'  s Tusculan  Questions  and from the Great Lord  Shaftesbury  In pronouncing these he was one Day so eager that he unfortunately bit his Tongue and in such a Manner that it not only put an End to his Discourse but created much Emotion in him and caused him to mutter an Oath or two But what was worst of all this Accident gave  Thwackum  who was present and who held all such Doctrine to be heathenish and atheistical an Opportunity to clap a Judgment on his Back Now this was done with so malicious a Sneer that it totally unhinged if I my so say the Temper of the Philosopher which the Bite of his Tongue had somewhat ruffled and he was so disabled from venting his Wrath at his Lips he had possibly found a more violent Method of revenging himself had not the Surgeon who was then luckily in the Room contrary to his own Interest interposed and preserved the Peace  Mr  Blifil  visited his Friend  Jones  but seldom and never alone This worthy young Man however professed much Regard for him and as great Concern at his Misfortune but cautiously avoided any  Intimacy lest as he frequently hinted it might contaminate the Sobriety of his own Character For which Purpose he had constantly in his Month that Proverb in which  Solomon  speaks against Evil Communication Not that he was so bitter as  Thwackum  for he always expressed some Hopes of  Tom'  s Reformation 'which' he said 'the unparallelled Goodness shewn by his Uncle on this Occasion must certainly effect in one not absolutely abandoned' but concluded 'if Mr  Jones  ever offends hereafter I shall not be able to say a Syllable in his Favour'  As to Squire  Western  he was seldom out of the Sick Room unless when he was engaged either in the Field or over his Bottle Nay he would sometimes retire hither to take his Beer and it was not without Difficulty that he was prevented from forcing  Jones  to take his Beer too For no Quack ever held his Nostrum to be a more general  Panacea  than he did this which he said had more Virtues in it than was in all the Physic in an Apothecary's Shop He was however by much Entreaty prevailed on to forbear the Application of this Medicine but from serenading his Patient every Morning with the Horn under his Window it was impossible to withhold him nor did he ever lay aside that Hollow with which he entered into all Companies when he visited  Jones  without any Regard to the sick Person's being at that Time either awake or asleep  This boisterous Behaviour as it meant no Harm so happily it effected none and was abundantly compensated to  Jones  as soon as he was able to sit up by the Company of  Sophia  whom the Squire then brought to visit him nor was it indeed long before  Jones  was able to attend her to the Harpsichord where she would kindly condescend for Hours together to charm him with the most delicious Music unless when the Squire thought proper to interrupt her by  insisting on  Old Sir Simon  or some other of his favourite Pieces  Notwithstanding the nicest Guard which  Sophia  endeavoured to set on her Behaviour she could not avoid letting some Appearances now and then slip forth For Love may again be likened to a Disease in this that when it is denied a Vent in one Part it will certainly break out in another What her Lips therefore concealed her Eyes her Blushes and many little involuntary Actions betrayed  One Day when  Sophia  was playing on the Harpsichord and  Jones  was attending the Squire came into the Room crying 'There  Tom  I have had a Battle for thee below Stairs with thick Parson  Thwackum  He hath been telling  Allworthy  before my Face that the broken Bone was a Judgment upon thee Dn it says I how can that be Did not he come by it in Defence of a young Woman A Judgment indeed Pox if he never doth any thing worse he will go to Heaven sooner than all the Parsons in the Country He hath more reason to glory in it than to be ashamed of it' 'Indeed Sir' says  Jones  'I have no Reason for either but if it preserved Miss  Western  I shall always think it the happiest Accident of my Life'And to gu' said the Squire 'to zet  Allworthy  against thee vor itDn 'un if the Parson had unt had his Petticuoats on I should ha lent un a Flick for I love thee dearly my Boy and dn me if if there is any thing in my Power which I won't do for thee Sha't take thy Choice of all the Horses in my Stable tomorrow Morning except only the  Chevalier  and Miss  Slouch' Jones  thanked him but declined accepting the Offer'Nay' added the Squire 'Shat ha the sorrel Mare that  Sophy  rode She cost me fifty Guineas and comes six Years old this Grass' If she had cost me a thousand' cries  Jones  passionately 'I would have given her to the  'Dogs' Pooh Pooh' answered  Western  'what because she broke thy Arm Shouldst forget and forgive I thought hadst been more a Man than to bear Malice against a dumb Creature'Here  Sophia  interposed and put an End to the Conversation by desiring her Father's Leave to play to him a Request which he never refused  The Countenance of  Sophia  had undergone more than one Change during the foregoing Speeches and probably she imputed the passionate Resentment which  Jones  had expressed against the Mare to a different Motive from that from which her Father had derived it Her Spirits were at this Time in a visible Flutter and she played so intolerably ill that had not  Western  soon fallen asleep he must have remarked it  Jones  however who was sufficiently awake and was not without an Ear any more than without Eyes made some Observations which being joined to all which the Reader may remember to have passed formerly gave him pretty strong Assurances when he came to reflect on the whole that all was not well in the tender Bosom of  Sophia  An Opinion which many young Gentlemen will I doubt not extremely wonder at his not having been well confirmed in long ago To confess the Truth he had rather too much Diffidence in himself and was not forward enough in seeing the Advances of a young Lady a Misfortune which can only be cured by that early Town Education which is at present so generally in Fashion  When these Thoughts had fully taken Possession of  Jones  they occasioned a Perturbation in his Mind which in a Constitution less pure and firm than his might have been at such a Season attended with very dangerous Consequences He was truly sensible of the great Worth of  Sophia  He extremely liked her Person no less admired her Accomplishments and tenderly loved her Goodness In Reality as he had never once entertained any Thought of possessing  her nor had ever given the least voluntary Indulgence  o his Inclinations he had a much stronger Passion for her than he himself was acquainted with His Heart now brought forth the full Secret at the same Time that it assured him the adorable Object returned his Affection  CHAP III  Which all who have no Heart will think to contain much ado about nothing  THE Reader will perhaps imagine the Sensations which now arose in  Jones  to have been so sweet and delicious that they would rather tend to produce a cheerful Serenity in the Mind than any of those dangerous Effects which we have mentioned but in fact Sensations of this Kind however delicious are at their first Recognition of a very tumultuous Nature and have very little of the Opiate in them They were moreover in the present Case embittered with certain Circumstances which being mixed with sweeter Ingredients tended altogether to compose a Draught that might be termed  bittersweet  than which as nothing can be more disagreeable to the Palate so nothing in the metaphorical Sense can be so injurious to the Mind  For first though he had sufficient foundation to flatter himself on what he had observed in  Sophia  he was not yet free from Doubt of misconstruing Compassion or at best Esteem into a warmer Regard He was far from a sanguine Assurance that  Sophia  had any such Affection towards him as might promise his Inclinations that Harvest which if they were encouraged and nursed they would finally grow up to require Besides if he could hope to find no Bar to his Happiness from the Daughter he thought himself certain of meeting an effectual Bar in the Father who though he was a Country Squire  in his Diversions was perfectly a Man of the World in whatever regarded his Fortune had the most violent Affection for this only Daughter and had often signified in his Cups the Pleasure he proposed in seeing her married to one of the richest Men in the County  Jones  was not so vain and senseless a Coxcomb as to expect from any Regard which  Western  had professed for him that he would ever be induced to lay aside these Views of advancing his Daughter He well knew that Fortune is generally the principal if not the sole Consideration which operates on the best of Parents in these Matters For Friendship makes us warmly espouse the Interest of others but is very cold to the Gratification of their Passions Indeed to feel the Happiness which may result from this it is necessary we should possess the Passion ourselves As he had therefore no Hopes of obtaining her Father's Consent so he thought to endeavour to succeed without it and by such Means to frustrate the Great Point of Mr  Western'  s Life was to make a very ill Use of his Hospitality and a very ungrateful Return to the many little Favours received however roughly at his Hands If he saw such a Consequence with Horror and Disdain how much more was he shocked with what regarded Mr  Allworthy  to whom as he had more than filial Obligations so had he for him more than filial Piety He knew the Nature of that good Man to be so averse to any Baseness o  Treachery that the least Attempt of such a Kind would make the guilty Person for ever odious to his Eyes and the Name of that Person a detestable Sound in his Ears The Appearance of such unsurmountable Difficulties was sufficient to have inspired him with Despair however ardent his Wishes had been but even these were controlled by Compassion for another Woman The Idea of lovely  Molly  now intruded itself before him He had sworn eternal Constancy in her Arms and she had as often vowed never  to outlive his deserting her He now saw her in all the most shocking Postures of Death nay he considered all the Miseries of Prostitution to which she would be liable and of which he would be doubly the Occasion first by seducing and then by deserting her for he well knew the Hatred which all her Neighbours and even her own Sisters bore her and ready they would all be to tear her to Pieces Indeed he had exposed her to more Envy than Shame or rather to the latter by Means of the former For many Women abused her for being a Whore while they envied her her Lover and Finery and would have been themselves glad to have purchased these at the same Rate The Ruin therefore of the poor Girl must he foresaw unavoidably attend his deserting her and this thought stung him to the Soul Poverty and Distress seemed to him to give none a Right of aggravating those Misfortunes The Meanness of her Condition did not represent her Misery as of little Consequence in his Eyes nor did it appear to justify or even to palliate his Guilt in bringing that Misery upon her But why do I mention Justification his own Heart would not suffer him to destroy a human Creature who he thought loved him and had to that Love sacrificed her Innocence His own good Heart pleaded her Cause not as a cold venal Advocate but as one interested in the Event and which must itself deeply share in all the Agonies its Owner brought on another  When this cunning Advocate had sufficiently raised the Pity of  Jones  by painting poor  Molly  in all the Circumstances of Wretchedness it artfuly called in the Assistance of another Passion and represented the Girl in all the amiable Colours of Youth Health and Beauty as one greatly the Object of Desire and much the more so at least to a good Mind from being at the same time the Object of Compassion  A midst these Thoughts poor  Jones  passed a long sleepless Night and in the Morning the Result of the whole was to abide by  Molly  and to think no more of  Sophia  In this virtuous Resolution he continued all the next Day till the Evening cherishing the Idea of  Molly  and driving  Sophia  from his Thoughts but in the fatal Evening a very trifling Accident set all his Passions again on Float worked so total a Change in his Mind that we think it decent to communicate it in a fresh Chapter  CHAP IV  A little Chapter in which is contained a little Incident  AMONG other Visitants who paid their Compliments to the young Gentleman in his Confinement Mrs  Honour  was one The Reader perhaps when he reflects on some Expressions which have formerly dropt from her may conceive that she herself had a very particular Affection for Mr  Jones  but in reality it was no such thing  Tom  was a handsome young Fellow and for that Species of Men Mrs  Honour  had some Regard but this was perfectly indiscriminate For having been crossed in the Love which she bore a certain Nobleman's Footman who had basely deserted her after a Promise of Marriage she had so securely kept together the broken Remains of her Heart that no Man had ever since been able to possess himself of any single Fragment She viewed all handsome Men with that equal Regard and Benevolence which a sober and virtuous Mind bears to all the GoodShe might indeed be called a Lover of Men as  Socrates  was a Lover of Mankind preferring one to another for corporeal as he for mental Qualifications but never carrying this Preference  so far as to cause any Perturbation in the philosophical Serenity of her Temper  The Day after Mr  Jones  had had that Conflict with himself which we have seen in the preceding Chapter Mrs  Honour  came into his Room and finding him alone began in the following Manner 'La Sir where do you think I have been I warrants you you would not guess in fifty Years but if you did guess to be sure I must not tell you neither' 'Nay if it be something which you must not tell me' said  Jones  'I shall have the Curiosity to enquire and I know you will not be so barbarous to refuse me' 'I don't know' cries she 'why I should refuse you neither for that Matter for to be sure you won't mention it any more And for that Matter if you knew where I had been unless you knew what I had been about it would not signify much Nay I don't see why it should be kept a Secret for my Part for to be sure she is the best Lady in the World' Upon this  Jones  began to beg earnestly to be let into this Secret and faithfully promised not to divulge it She then proceeded thus 'Why you must know Sir my young Lady sent me to enquire after  Molly Seagrim  and to see whether the Wench wanted any thing to be sure I did not care to go methinks but Servants must do what they are orderedHow could you undervalue yourself so Mr  Jones  So my Lady bid me go and carry her some Linnen and other ThingsShe is too good If such forward Sluts were sent to  Bridewell  it would be better for them I told my Lady says I Madam Your La'ship is encouraging Idleness' And was my  Sophia  so good' says  Jones'  My  Sophia  I assure you marry come up' answered  Honour  'And yet if you knew allIndeed if I was as Mr  Jones  I should look a little higher than such Trumpery as  Molly Seagrim'  'What  do you mean by these Words' replied  Jones  'I  I knew all' 'I mean what I mean' says  Honour  Don't you remember putting your Hands in my Lady's Muff once I vow I could almost find in my Heart to tell if I was certain my Lady would never come to the Hearing on't'  Jones  then made several solemn Protestations And  Honour  proceeded'then to be sure my Lady gave me that Muff and afterwards upon hearing what you had done' 'Then you told her what I had done interrupted  Jones  'If I did Sir' answered she 'you need not be angry with me Many's the Man would have given his Head to have had my Lady told if they had knownfor to be sure the biggest Lord in the Land might be proudbut I protest I have a great mind not to tell you'  Jones  fell to Entreaties and soon prevailed on he  to go on thus 'You must know then Sir tha  my Lady had given this Muff to me but about Day or two after I had told her the Story she quarrels with her new Muff and to be sure it is th  prettiest that ever was seen  Honour'  says shethis is an odious Muffit is too big for meI can't wear ittill I can get another you must let me have my old one again and you may have this in the room on'tfor she's a good Lady and scorns to give a Thing and take a Thing I promise you that So to be sure I fetched it her back again  and I believe she hath worn it upon her Arm al  most ever since and I warrants hath given it many' a Kiss when nobody hath seen her  Here the Conversation was interrupted by Mr  Western  himself who came to summon  Jones  to the Harpsichord whither the poor young Fellow went all pale and trembling This  Western  observed but on seeing Mrs  Honour  imputed it to a wrong Cause and having given  Jones  a hearty Curse between Jes  and Earnest he bid him beat abroad and not poach up the Game in his Warren  Sophia  looked this Evening with more than usual Beauty and we may believe it was no small Addition  o her Charms in the Eye of Mr  Jones  that she  ow happened to have on her Right Arm this very Muff  She was playing one of her Father's favourite Tunes and he was leaning on her Chair when the Muff fell over her Fingers and put her out This  o disconcerted the Squire that he snatched the Muff from her and with a hearty Curse threw it into the  ire  Sophia  instantly started up and with the utmost Eagerness recovered it from the Flames  Though this Incident will probably appear of little  onsequence to many of our Readers yet trifling as was it had so violent an Effect on poor  Jones  that  e thought it our Duty to relate it In reality there  e many little Circumstances too often omitted by judicious Historians from which Events of the utmost Importance arise The World may indeed be  onsidered as a vast Machine in which the great Wheels are originally set in Motion by those which  e very minute and almost imperceptible to any but  e strongest Eyes  Thus not all the Charms of the incomparable  Sophia  not all the dazzling Brightness and languishing softness of her Eyes the Harmony of her Voice  of her Person not all her Wit good Humour Greatness of Mind or sweetness of Disposition had  een able so absolutely to conquer and enslave the  eart of poor  Jones  as this little Incident of the Muff Thus the Poet sweetly sings of  Troy  Capti{que} dolis lachrymis{que} coacti  Quos ne{que} Tydides nec Larissaeus Achilles  Non anni domuere decem non mille Carinae  What  Diomede  or  Thetis'  greater Son  A thousand Ships nor ten Years Siege had done  False Fears and fawning Words the City won  DRYDEN  The Citadel of  Jones  was now taken by Surprize All those Considerations of Honour and Prudence which our Heroe had lately with so much milita  Wisdom placed as Guards over the Avenues of h  Heart ran away from their Posts and the God Love marched in in Triumph  CHAP V  A very long Chapter containing a very great Inciden  BUT though this victorious Deity easily expelle  his avowed Enemies from the Heart of  Jones  found it more difficult to supplant the Garrison whi  he himself had placed there To lay aside all All…gory the Concern for what must become of po  Molly  greatly disturbed and perplexed the Mind the worthy Youth The superior Merit of  Sophia  totally ecclipsed or rather extinguished all the Bea  ties of the poor Girl but compassion instead of Contempt succeeded to Love He was convinced t  Girl had placed all her Affections and all her Prosp  of future Happiness in him only For this he ha  he knew given sufficient Occasion by the utmo  Profusion of Tenderness towards her A Tenderness which he had taken every Means to persuade  he would always maintain She on her Side h  assured him of her firm Belief in his Promise a  had with the most solemn Vows declared that his fulfilling or breaking these Promises it depend  whether she should be the happiest or the most mi  …rable of Womankind And to be the Author this highest Degree of Misery to a human Bei  was a Thought on which he could not bear to ru  +nate a single Moment He considered this poor  as having sacrificed to him every Thing in her little Power as having been at her own Expence the Object of his Pleasure as sighing and languishing for him even at that very Instant Shall then says he my Recovery for which she hath so ardently wished shall my Presence which she hath so eagerly expected instead of giving her that Joy with which she hath flattered herself cast her at once down into Misery and Despair Can I be such a Villain Here when the Genius of poor  Molly  seem'd triumphant the Love of  Sophia  towards him which now appeared no longer dubious rushed upon his Mind and bore away every Obstacle before it  At length it occurred to him that he might possibly be able to make  Molly  amends another Way namely by giving her a Sum of Money This nevertheless he almost despaired of her accepting when he recollected the frequent and vehement Assurances he had received from her that the World put in Ballance with him would make her no amends for his Loss However her extreme Poverty and chiefly her egregious Vanity somewhat of which hath been already hinted to the Reader gave him some little Hope that notwithstanding all her avowed Tenderness she might in Time be brought to content herself with a Fortune superiour to her Expectation and which might indulge her Vanity by setting her above all her Equals He resolved therefore to take the first Opportunity of making a Proposal of this Kind  One Day accordingly when his Arm was so well recovered that he could walk easily with it slung in a Sash he stole forth at a Season when the Squire was engaged in his Field Exercises and visited his Fair one Her Mother and Sisters whom he found caking their Tea informed him first that  Molly  was not at Home but afterwards the elder Sister acquainted him with a malicious Smile that she was  above Stairs abed  Tom  had no Objection to this Situation of his Mistress and immediately ascended the Ladder which led towards her BedChamber but when he came to the Top he to his great Surprize found the Door fast nor could he for some Time obtain any Answer from within for  Molly  as she herself afterwards informed him was fast asleep  The Extremes of Grief and Joy have been remarked to produce very similar Effects and when either of these rushes on us by Surprize it is apt to create such a total Perturbation and Confusion that we are often thereby deprived of the Use of all our Faculties It cannot therefore be wondered at that the unex+pected Sight of Mr  Jones  should so strongly operate on the Mind of  Molly  and should overwhelm he  with such Confusion that for some Minutes she wa  unable to express the great Raptures with which the Reader will suppose she was affected on this Occasion  As for  Jones  he was so entirely possessed and as i  were enchanted by the Presence of his beloved Object that he for a while forgot  Sophia  and consequently the principal Purpose of his Visit  This however soon recurred to his Memory and after the first Transports of their Meeting were over he found Means by Degrees to introduce a Discourse on the fatal Consequences which must attend their Amour if Mr  Allworthy  who had strictly for bidden him ever seeing her more should discover that he still carried on this Commerce Such a Discovery which his Enemies gave him Reason to thing would be unavoidable must he said end in his Ruin and consequently in hers Since therefore their hard Fates had determined that they must separate he advised her to bear it with Resolution and swore he would never omit any Opportunity through the Course of his Life of shewing her the Sincerity of his Affection by providing for her in a Manner beyond her utmost Expectation or even beyond her wishes  if ever that should be in his Power concluding at last that she might soon find some Man who would marry her and who would make her much happier than she could be by leading a disreputable Life with him  Molly  remained a few Moments in Silence and then bursting into a Flood of Tears she began to upbraid him in the following Words 'And is this your Love for me to forsake me in this Manner now you have ruined me How often when I have told you that all Men are false and Perjury alike and grow tired of us as soon as ever they have had their wicked Wills of us how often have you sworn you would never forsake me And can you be such a Perjury Man after all What signifies all the Riches in the World to me without you now you have gained my Heart so you haveyou have Why do you mention another Man to me I can never love any other Man as long as I live All other Men are nothing to me If the greatest Squire in all the Country would come a suiting to me tomorrow I would not give my Company to him No I shall always hate and despise the whole Sex for your Sake'  She was proceeding thus when an Accident put a Stop to her Tongue before it had run out half its Career The Room or rather Garret in which  Molly  ay being up one Pair of Stairs that is to say at the Top of the House was of a sloping Figure resembling the great  Delta  of the  Greeks  The  English  Reader may perhaps form a better Idea of it by being told that it was impossible to stand upright any where but in the Middle Now as this Room wanted the Conveniency of a Closet  Molly  had to supply that Defect nailed up an old Rug against the Rafters of the House which enclosed a little Hole where her best Apparel such as the Remains of that Sack which we have formerly mentioned some Caps and other  Things with which she had lately provided herself were hung up and secured from the Dust  This inclosed Place exactly fronted the Foot of the Bed to which indeed the Rug hung so near that it served in a Manner to supply the Want of Curtains Now whether  Molly  in the Agonies of her Rage pushed this Rug with her Feet or  Jones  might touch it or whether the Pin or Nail gave way of its own Accord I am not certain but as  Molly  pronounced those last Words which are recorded above the wicked Rug got loose from its Fastning and discovered every thing hid behind it where among other female Utensils appearedwith Shame I write it and with Sorrow will it be readthe Philosopher  Square  in a Posture for the Place would not near admit of his standing upright as ridiculous as can possibly be conceived  The Posture indeed in which he stood was not greatly unlike that of a Soldier who is tyed Neck and Heels or rather resembling the Attitude in which we often see Fellows in the public Streets of  London  who are not suffering but deserving Punishment by so standing He had a Nightcap belonging to  Molly  on his Head and his two large Eyes the Moment the Rug  fell stared directly at  Jones  so that when the Idea of Philosophy was added to the Figure now discovered it would have been very difficult for any Spectator to have refrained from immoderate Laughter  I question not but the Surprize of the Reader will be here equal to that of  Jones  as the Suspicions which must arise from the Appearance of this wise and grave Man in such a Place may seem so inconsistent with that Character which he hath doubtless maintained hitherto in the Opinion of every one  But to confess the Truth this Inconsistency is rather imaginary than real Philosophers are composed of Flesh and Blood as well as other human Creatures  and however sublimated and refined the Theory of these may be a little practical Frailty is as incident to them as to other Mortals It is indeed in The  ry only and not in Practice as we have before hinted that consists the Difference For though such great Beings think much better and more wisely they always act exactly like other Men They know very well how to subdue all Appetites and Passions and  o despise both Pain and Pleasure and this Knowledge affords much delightful Contemplation and is easily acquired but the Practice would be vexatious and troublesome and therefore the same Wisdom which teaches them to know this teaches them to avoid carrying it into Execution  Mr  Square  happened to be at Church on that  Sunday  when as the Reader may be pleased to remember the Appearance of  Molly  in her Sack had caused all this Disturbance Here he first observed her and was so pleased with her Beauty that he prevailed with the young Gentlemen to change their intended Ride that Evening that he might pass by the Habitation of  Molly  and by that Means might obtain a second Chance of seeing her This Reason however as he did not at that Time mention to any  o neither did we think proper to communicate it then to the Reader  Among other Particulars which constituted the Unfitness of Things in Mr  Square'  s Opinion Danger and Difficulty were two The Difficulty therefore which he apprehended there might be in corrupting this young Wench and the Danger which would accrue to his Character on the Discovery were  ach strong Dissuasives that it is probable he at first intended to have contented himself with the pleasing Ideas which the Sight of Beauty furnishes us with These the gravest Men after a full Meal of Meditation often allow themselves by Way of Desert For which Purpose certain Books and Pictures find their  Way into the most private Recesses of their Study and a certain liquorish Part of natural Philosophy is often the principal Subject of their Conversation  But when the Philosopher heard a Day or two afterwards that the Fortress of Virtue had already been subdued he began to give a larger Scope to his Desires His Appetite was not of that squeamish Kind which cannot feed on a Dainty because another had tasted it In short he liked the Girl the better for the Want of that Chastity which if she had possessed it must have been a Bar to his Pleasures he pursued and obtained her  The Reader will be mistaken if he thinks  Molly  gave  Square  the Preference to her younger Lover On the contrary had she been confined to the Choice of one only  Tom Jones  would undoubtedly have been of the two the victorious Person No  was it solely the Consideration that two are better than one tho' this had it's proper Weight to which Mr  Square  owed his Success the Absence of  Jones  during his Confinement was an unlucky Circumstance and in that Interval some well chosen presents from the Philosopher so softened and unguarded the Girl's Heart that a favourable Opportunity became irresistable and  Square  triumphed over the poor Remains of Virtue which subsisted in the Bosom of  Molly  It was now about a Fortnight since this Conquest when  Jones  paid the abovementioned Visit to his Mistress at a time when she and  Square  were in Bed together This was the true Reason why the Mother denied her as we have seen for as the old Womanshared in the Profits arising from the Iniquity of her Daughter she encouraged and protected her in it to the utmost of her Power but such was the Envy and Hatred which the eldest Sister bore towards  Molly  that notwithstanding she had some Part of the Booty she would willingly have parted with this to ruin her Sister and spoil her Trade Hence she had acquainted  Jones  with her being above Stairs in Bed in Hopes that he might have caught her in  Square'  s Arms This however  Molly  found Means to prevent as the Door was fastned which gave her an Opportunity of conveying her Lover behind that Rug or Blan  et where he now was unhappily discovered  Square  no sooner made his Appearance than  Molly  flung herself back in her Bed cried out she was undone and abandoned herself to Despair This poor Girl who was yet but a Novice in her Business had  ot arrived to that Perfection of Assurance which helps off a Town Lady in any Extremity and either prompts her with an Excuse or else inspires her to brazen out the Matter with her Husband who from Love of Quiet or out of Fear of his Reputation and sometimes perhaps from Fear of the Gallant who like Mr  Constant  in the Play wears a Sword is glad to shut his Eyes and contented to put his Horns in his Pocket  Molly  on the contrary was silenced by this Evidence and very fairly gave up a Cause which she had hitherto with so many Tears and with such solemn and vehement Protestations of the purest Love and Constancy maintained  As to the Gentleman behind the Arras he was not in much less Consternation He stood for a while motionless and seemed equally at a Loss what to say or whither to direct his Eyes  Jones  tho' perhaps the most astonished of the three first found his Tongue and being immediately recovered from those uneasy Sensations which  Molly  by her upbraidings had occasioned he burst into a loud Laughter and then saluting Mr  Square  advanced to take him by the Hand and to relieve him from his Place of Confinement  Square  being now arrived in the Middle of the Room in which Part only he could stand upright looked at  Jones  with a very grave Countenance and  said to him 'Well Sir I see you enjoy this mighty Discovery and I dare swear taste great Delight in the Thoughts of exposing me but if you will consider the Matter fairly you will find you are yourself only to blame I have done nothing for which that Part of the World which judges of Matters by the Rule of Right will condemn me Fitness is governed by the Nature of Things and not by Customs Forms or municipal Laws Nothing is indeed unfit which is not unnatural' 'Well reasoned old Boy' answered  Jones  'but why dost thou think I should desire to expose thee I promise thee I was never better pleased with thee in my Life and unless thou hast a Mind to discover it thyself this Affair may remain a profound Secret for me' 'Nay Mr  Jones'  replied  Square  'I would not be thought to undervalue Reputation Good Fame is a Species of the KALON and it is by no Means fitting to neglect it Besides to murder one's own Reputation is a kind of Suicide a detestable odious Vice If you think proper therefore to conceal any Infirmity of mine for such I may have since no Man is perfectly perfect I promise you I will not betray myself Things may be fitting to be done which are not fitting to be boasted of for by the perverse Judgment of the World That often becomes the Subject of Censure which is in Truth not only innocent but laudable' 'Right' cries  Jones  'what can be more innocent than the Indulgence of a natural Appetite or what more laudable than the Propagation of our Species' 'To be serious with you' answered  Square  'I profess they always appeared so to me' 'And yet' said  Jones  'you was of a different Opinion when my Affair with this Girl was first discovered' 'Why I must confess' says  Square  'as the Matter was misrepresented to me by that Parson  Thwakum  I might condemn the Corruption of Innocence It  was that Sir it was thatand that For you must know Mr  Jones  in the Consideration of Fitness very minute Circumstances Sir very minute Circumstances cause great Alteration' 'Well' cries  Jones  'be that as it will it shall be your own Fault as I have promised you if you ever hear any more of this Adventure Behave kindly to the Girl and I will never open my Lips concerning the Matter to any one And  Molly  do you be faithful to your Friend and I will not only forgive your Infidelity to me but will do you all the Service I can' So saying he took a hasty Leave and slipping down the Ladder retired with much Expedition  Square  was rejoyced to find this Adventure was likely to have no worse Conclusion and as for  Molly  being recovered from her Confusion she began at first to upbraid  Square  with having been the Occasion of her Loss of  Jones  but that Gentleman soon found the Means of mitigating her Anger partly by a small Nostrum from his Purse of wonderful and approved Efficacy in purging off the ill Humours of the Mind and in restoring it to a good Temper  She then poured forth a vast Profusion of Tenderness towards her new Lover turned all she had said to  Jones  and  Jones  himself into Ridicule and vowed tho' he had had the Possession of her Person that none but  Square  had ever been Master of her Heart  CHAP VI  By comparing which with the former the Reader may possibly correct some Abuse which he hath formerly been guilty of in the Application of the Word  LOVE  THE Infidelity of  Molly  which  Jones  had now discovered would perhaps have vindicated a  much greater Degree of Resentment than he expressed on the Occasion and if he had abandoned her directly from that Moment very few I believe would have blamed him  Certain however it is that he saw her in the Light of Compassion and tho' his Love to her was not of that Kind which could give him any great Uneasiness at her Inconstancy yet was he not a little shocked on reflecting that he had himself originally corrupted her Innocence for to this Corruption he imputed all the Vice into which she appeared now so likely to plunge herself  This Consideration gave him no little Uneasiness till  Betty  the elder Sister was so kind some time afterwards entirely to cure him by a Hint that one  Will Barnes  and not himself had been the first Seducer of  Molly  and that the little Child which he had hitherto so certainly concluded to be his own might very probably have an equal Title at least to claim  Barnes  for its Father  Jones  eagerly pursued this Scent when he had first received it and in a very short Time was sufficiently assured that the Girl had told him Truth not only by the Confession of the Fellow but at last by that of  Molly  herself  This  Will Barnes  was a Country Gallant and had acquired as many Trophies of this Kind as any Ensign or Attorney's Clerk in the Kingdom He had indeed reduced several Women to a State of utter Profligacy had broke the Hearts of some and had the Honour of occasioning the violent Death of one poor Girl who had either drowned herself or what was rather more probable had been drowned by him  Among other of his Conquests this Fellow had triumphed over the Heart of  Betty Seagrim  He had made love to her long before  Molly  was grown to be a fit Object of that Pastime but had afterwards deserted her and applied to her Sister with whom he  had almost immediate Success Now  Will  had in reality the sole Possession of  Molly'  s Affection while  Jones  and  Square  were almost equally Sacrifices to her Interest and to her Pride  Hence had grown that implacable Hatred which we have before seen raging in the Mind of  Betty  though we did not think it necessary to assign this Cause sooner as Envy itself was alone adequate to all the Effects we have mentioned  Jones  was become perfectly easy by Possession of this Secret with Regard to  Molly  but as to  Sophia  he was far from being in a State of Tranquillity nay indeed he was under the most violent Perturbation His Heart was now if I may use the Metaphor entirely evacuated and  Sophia  took absolute Possession of it He loved her with an unbounded Passion and plainly saw the tender Sentiments she had for him yet could not this Assurance lessen his Despair of obtaining the Consent of her Father nor the Horrors which attended his Pursuit of her by any base or treacherous Method  The Injury which he must thus do to Mr  Western  and the Concern which would accrue to Mr  Allworthy  were Circumstances that tormented him all Day and haunted him on his Pillow at Night His Life was a constant Struggle between Honour and Inclination which alternately triumphed over each other in his Mind He often resolved in the Absence of  Sophia  to leave her Father's House and to see her no more and as often in her presence forgot all those Resolutions and determined to pursue her at the Hazard of his Life and at the Forfeiture of what was much dearer to him  This Conflict began soon to produce very strong and visible Effects For he lost all his usual Sprightliness and Gaiety of Temper and became not only melancholy when alone but dejected and absent in Company nay if ever he put on a forced Mirth to  comply with Mr  Western'  s Humour the Constraint appeared so plain that he may seem to have been giving the strongest Evidence of what he endeavoured to conceal by such Ostentation  It may perhaps be a Question whether the Art which he used to conceal his Passion or the Means which honest Nature employed to reveal it betrayed him most For while Art made him more than ever reserved to  Sophia  and forbad him to address any of his Discourse to her nay to avoid meeting her Eyes with the utmost Caution Nature was no less busy in counterplotting him Hence at the Approach of the young Lady he grew pale and if this was sudden started If his Eyes accidentally met hers the Blood rushed into his Cheeks and his Countenance became all over Scarlet If common Civility ever obliged him to speak to her as to drink her Health at Table his Tongue was sure to faulter If he touched her his Hand nay his whole Frame trembled And if any Discourse tended however remotely to raise the Idea of Love an involuntary Sigh seldom failed to steal from his Bosom Most of which Accidents Nature was wonderfully industrious to throw in his Way  All these Symptoms escaped the Notice of the Squire but not so of  Sophia  She soon perceived these Agitations of Mind in  Jones  and was at no Loss to discover the Cause for indeed she recognized it in her own Breast And this Recognition is I suppose that Sympathy which hath been so often noted in Lovers and which will sufficiently account for her being so much quickersighted than her Father  But to say the Truth there is a more simple and plain Method of accounting for that prodigious Superiority of Penetration which we must observe in some Men over the rest of the human Species and one which will not only serve in the Case of Lovers but of all others For whence is it that the Knave is generally  so quicksighted to those Symptoms and Operations of Knavery which often dupe an honest Man of a much better Understanding There surely is no general Sympathy among Knaves nor have they like Free Masons any common Sign of Communication In reality it is only because they have the same thing in their Heads and their thoughts are turned the same Way Thus that  Sophia  saw and that  Western  did not see the plain Symptoms of Love in  Jones  can be no Wonder when we consider that the Idea of Love never entered into the Head of the Father whereas the Daughter at present thought of nothing else  When  Sophia  was well satisfied of the Passion which tormented poor  Jones  and no less certain that she herself was its Object she had not the least Difficulty in discovering the true Cause of his present Behaviour This highly endeared him to her and raised in her Mind two of the best Affections which any Lover can wish to raise in a Mistress These were Esteem and Pity for sure the most outragiously rigid among her Sex will excuse her pitying a Man whom she saw miserable on her own Account nor can they blame her for esteeming one who visibly from the most honourable Motives endeavoured to smother a Flame in his own Bosom which like the famous  Spartan  Theft was preying upon and consuming his very Vitals Thus his Backwardness his Shunning her his Coldness and his Silence were the forwardest the most diligent the warmest and most eloquent Advocates and wrought so violently on her sensible and tender Heart that she soon felt for him all those gentle Sensations which are consistent with a virtuous and elevated female MindIn short all which esteem Gratitude and Pity can inspire in such towards an agreeable ManIndeed all which the nicest Delicacy can allowIn a Wordshe was in Love with him to Distraction  One Day this young Couple accidentally met in the Garden at the End of two Walks which were both bounded by that Canal in which  Jones  had formerly risqued drowning to retrieve the little Bird that  Sophia  had there lost  This Place had been of late much frequented by  Sophia  Here she used to ruminate with a Mixture of Pain and Pleasure on an Incident which however trifling in itself had possibly sown the first Seeds of that Affection which was now arrived to such Maturity in her Heart  Here then this young Couple met They were almost close together before either of them knew any Thing of the other's Approach A Bystander would have discovered sufficient Marks of Confusion in the Countenance of each but they felt too much themselves to make any Observation As soon as  Jones  had a little recovered his first Surprize he accosted the young Lady with some of the ordinary forms of Salutation which she in the same Manner returned and their Conversation began as usual on the delicious Beauty of the Morning Hence they passed to the Beauty of the Place on which  Jones  launched forth very high Encomiums When they came to the Tree whence he had formerly tumbled into the Canal  Sophia  could not help reminding him of that Accident and said 'I fancy Mr  Jones  you have some little shuddering when you see that Water' 'I assure you Madam' answered  Jones  'the Concern you felt at the Loss of your little Bird will always appear to me the highest Circumstance in that Adventure Poor little  Tommy  there is the Branch he stood upon How could the little Wretch have the Folly to fly away from that State of Happiness in which I had the Honour to place him His Fate was a just Punishment for his Ingratitude' 'Upon my Word Mr  Jones'  said she 'your Gallantry very narrowly escaped as severe a Fate Sure the Remembrance  must affect you' 'Indeed Madam' answered he 'if I have any Reason to reflect with Sorrow on it it is perhaps that the Water had not been a little deeper by which I might have escaped many bitter Heartachs that Fortune seems to have in Store for me' 'Fie Mr  Jones'  replied  Sophia  'I am sure you cannot be in Earnest now This affected Contempt of Life is only an Excess of your Complaisance to me You would endeavour to lessen the Obligation of having twice ventured it for my Sake Beware the third Time'She spoke these last Words with a Smile and a Softness inexpressible  Jones  answered with a Sigh 'He feared it was already too late for Caution'and then looking tenderly and stedfastly on her he cry'd 'Oh Miss  Western  Can you desire me to live Can you wish me so ill'  Sophia  looking down on the Ground answered with some Hesitation Indeed Mr  Jones  I do not wish you ill'Oh I know too well that heavenly Temper' cries  Jones  'that divine Goodness which is beyond every other Charm' Nay now' answered she I understand you notI can stay no longerI I would not be understood' cries he' 'nay I can't be understood I know not what I say Meeting here so unexpectedlyI have been unguardedfor Heaven's Sake pardon me if I have said any Thing to offend youI did not mean itindeed I would rather have diednay the very Thought would kill me' 'You surprize me' answered she'How can you possibly think you have offended me' 'Fear Madam' says he easily runs into Madness and there is no Degree of Fear like that which I feel of offending you How can I speak then Nay don't look angrily at me one Frown will destroy meI mean nothingBlame my Eyes or blame those Beauties  What am I saying Pardon me if I have said too much My Heart overflowed I have struggled with my Love to the utmost and have endeavoured to conceal a Fever which preys on my Vitals and will I hope soon make it impossible for me' ever to offend you more  Mr  Jones  now fell a trembling as if he had been shaken with the Fit of an Ague  Sophia  who was in a Situation not very different from his answered in these Words 'Mr  Jones  I will not affect to misunderstand you indeed I understand you too well but for Heaven's Sake if you have any Affection for me let me make the best of my way into the House I wish I may be able to support myself thither'  Jones  who was hardly able to support himself offered her his Arm which she condescended to accept but begged he would not mention a Word more to her of this Nature at present He promised he would not insisting only on her Forgiveness of what Love without the Leave of his Will had forced from him This she told him he knew how to obtain by his future Behaviour and thus this young Pair tottered and trembled along the Lover not once daring to squeeze the Hand of his Mistress tho' it was locked in his  Sophia  immediately retired to her Chamber where Mrs  Honour  and the Hartshorn were summoned to her Assistance As to poor  Jones  the only Relief to his distempered Mind was an unwelcome Piece of News which as it opens a Scene of a different Nature from those in which the Reader hath lately been conversant will be communicated to him in the next Chapter  CHAP VII  In which Mr  Allworthy  appears on a SickBed  MR  Western  was become so fond of  Jones  that he was unwilling to part with him tho' his Arm had been long since cured and  Jones  either from his Love of Sport or from some other Reason was easily persuaded to continue at his House which he did sometimes for a Fortnight together without paying a single Visit at Mr  Allworthy'  s nay without ever hearing from thence  Mr  Allworthy  had been for some Days indisposed with a Cold which had been attended with a little Fever This he had however neglected as it was usual with him to do all Manner of Disorders which did not confine him to his Bed or prevent his several Faculties from performing their ordinary Functions A Conduct which we would by no Means be thought to approve or recommend to Imitation For surely the Gentlemen of the  Aesculapian  Art are in the Right in advising that the Moment the Disease is entered at one Door the Physician should be introduced at the other what else is meant by that old Adage  Venienti  ccurrite Morbo  "Oppose a Distemper at its first Approach" Thus the Doctor and the Disease meet in fair and equal Conflict whereas by giving Time to the latter we often suffer him to fortify and entrench himself like a  French  Army so that the learned Gentleman finds it very difficult and sometimes impossible to come at the Enemy Nay sometimes by gaining Time the Disease applies to the  French  military Politics and corrupts Nature over to his Side and then all the Powers of Physick must arrive too late Agreeable to these Observations was I remember the complaint of the great Doctor  Misaubin  who used very pathetically to lament the late Applications which were made to his Skill Saying  'Bygar me believe my Pation take me for de Under taker For dey never send for me till de Physicion have kill dem'  Mr  Allworthy'  s Distemper by Means of this Neglect gained such Ground that when the Increase o  his Fever obliged him to send for Assistance the Doctor at his first Arrival shook his Head wished he had been sent for sooner and intimated that he thought him in very imminent Danger Mr  Allworthy  who had settled all his Affairs in the World and was as well prepared as it is possible for human Nature to be for the other received this Information with the utmost Calmness and Unconcern He could indeed whenever he laid himself down to Rest say with  Cato  in the tragical Poem  Let Guilt or Fear  Disturb Man's Rest  Cato  knows neither of them  Indifferent in his Choice to sleep or die  In Reality he could say this with ten times more Reason and Confidence than  Cato  or any other proud Fellow among the antient or modern Heroes For he was not only devoid of Fear but might be considered as a faithful Labourer when at the End of Harvest he is summoned to receive his Reward at the Hands of a bountiful Master  The good Man gave immediate Orders for all his Family to be summoned round him None of these were then abroad but Mrs  Blifil  who had been some Time in  London  and Mr  Jones  whom the Reader hath just parted from at Mr  Western'  s and who received this Summons just as  Sophia  had left him  The News of Mr  Allworthy'  s Danger for the Servant told him he was dying drove all Thoughts of Love out of his Head He hurried instantly into the Chariot which was sent for him and ordered the  Coachman to drive with all imaginable Haste nor did the Idea of  Sophia  I believe once occur to him on the Way  And now the whole Family namely Mr  Blifil  Mr  Jones  Mr  Thwackum  Mr  Square  and some of the Servants for such were Mr  Allworthy'  s Orders being all assembled round his Bed the good Man sat up in it and was beginning to speak when  Blifil  fell to blubbering and began to express very loud and bitter Lamentations Upon this Mr  Allworthy  shook him by the Hand and said 'Do not sorrow thus my dear Nephew at the most ordinary of all human Occurrences When Misfortunes befal our Friends we are justly grieved For those are Accidents which might often have been avoided and which may seem to render the Lot of one Man more peculiarly unhappy than that of others but Death is certainly unavoidable and is that common Lot in which alone the Fortunes of all Men agree nor is the Time when this happens to us material If the wisest of Men hath compared Life to a Span surely we may be allowed to consider it as a Day It is my Fate to leave it in the Evening but those who are taken away earlier have only lost a few Hours at the best little worth lamenting and much oftner Hours of Labour and Fatigue of Pain and Sorrow One of the  Roman  Poets I remember likens our leaving Life to our Departure from a Feast A Thought which hath often occurred to me when I have seen Men struggling to protract an Entertainment and to enjoy the Company of their Friends a few Moments longer Alas how short is the most protracted of such Enjoyments How immaterial the Difference between him who retires the soonest and him who stays the latest This is seeing Life in the best View and this Unwillingness to quit  our Friends is the most amiable Motive from which we can derive the Fear of Death and yo  the longest Enjoyment which we can hope for o  this Kind is of so trivial a Duration that it is to  wise Man truly contemptible Few Men I own think in this Manner for indeed few Men think of Death 'till they are in its Jaws However gigantic and terrible an Object this may appear when it approaches them they are nevertheless incapable of seeing it at any Distance nay tho' they have been ever so much frightned and alarmed when they have apprehended themselves in Danger o  dying they are no sooner cleared from this Apprehension than even the Fears of it are erased from their Minds But alas he who escapes from Death is not pardoned he is only reprieved and reprieved to a short Day'  'Grieve therefore no more my dear Child on this Occasion an Event which may happen every Hour which every Element nay almost every Particle of Matter that surrounds us is capable of producing and which must and will most unavoidably reach us all at last ought neither to occasion our Surprize nor our Lamentation'  'My Physician having acquainted me which I take very kindly of him that I am in Danger of leaving you all very shortly I have determined to say a few Words to you at this our Parting before my Distemper which I find grows very fast upon me puts it out of my Power'  'But I shall waste my Strength too muchI intended to speak concerning my Will which tho' I have settled long ago I think proper to mention such Heads of as concern any of you that I may have the Comfort of perceiving you are all satisfied with the Provision I have there made for you'  'Nephew  Blifil  I leave you the Heir to my whole Estate except only  l  a Year which is to revert  to you after the Death of your Mother and except one other Estate of  l  a Year and the Sum of  l  which I have bestowed in the following Manner'  'The Estate of  l  a Year I have given to you Mr  Jones  And as I know the Inconvenience which attends the Want of ready Money I have added  l  in Specie In this I know not whether I have exceeded or fallen short of your Expectatation Perhaps you will think I have given you too little and the World will be as ready to condemn me for giving you too much but the latter Censure I despise and as to the former unless you should entertain that common Error which I have often heard in my Life pleaded as an Excuse for a total Want of Charity namely that instead of raising Gratitude by voluntary Acts of Bounty we are apt to raise Demands which of all others are the most boundless and most difficult to satisfiyPardon me the bare Mention of this I will not suspect any such Thing'  Jones  flung himself at his Benefactor's Feet and taking eagerly hold of his Hand assured him his Goodness to him both now and at all other Times had so infinitely exceeded not only his Merit but his Hopes that no Words could express his Sense of it 'And I assure you Sir said he your present Generosity hath left me no other Concern than for the present melancholy OccasionOh my Friend my Father' Here his Words choaked him and he turned away to hide a Tear which was starting from his Eyes  Allworthy  then gently squeezed his Hand and proceeded thus 'I am convinced my Child that you have much Goodness Generosity and Honour in your Temper if you will add Prudence and Religion to these you must be happy For the three  former Qualities I admit make you worthy o  Happiness but they are the latter only which will put you in Possession of it'  'One thousand Pound I have given to you Mr  Thwackum  a Sum I am convinced which greatly exceeds your Desires as well as your Wants However you will receive it as a Memorial of my Friendship and whatever Superfluities may redound to you that Piety which you so rigidly maintain will instruct you how to dispose of it'  'A like Sum Mr  Square  I have bequeathed to you This I hope will enable you to pursue your Profession with better Success than hitherto I have often observed with Concern that Distress is more apt to excite Contempt than Commiseration especially among Men of Business with whom Poverty is understood to indicate Want of Ability But the little I have been able to leave you will extricate you from those Difficulties with which you have formerly struggled and then I doubt not but you will meet with sufficient Prosperity to supply what a Man of your Philosophical Temper will require'  'I find myself growing faint so I shall refer you to my Will for my Disposition of the Residue My Servants will there find some Tokens to remember me by and there are a few Charities which I trust my Executors will see faithfully performed Bless you all' I am setting out a little before you  Here a Footman came hastily into the Room and said there was an Attorney from  Salisbury  who had a particular Message which he said he must communicate to Mr  Allworthy  himself That he seemed in a violent Hurry and protested he had so much Business to do that if he could cut himself into four Quarters all would not be sufficient  Go Child said  Allworthy  to  Blifil  see what the Gentleman wants I am not able to do any Business  now nor can he have any with me in which you  re not at present more concerned than myself Be  des I really amI am incapable of seeing any one  present or of any longer Attention He then sa  ted them all saying perhaps he would be able to  e them again but he should be now glad to compose himself a little finding that he had too much ex  austed his Spirits in Discourse  Some of the Company shed Tears at their Parting  nd even the Philosopher  Square  wiped his Eyes  al  it unused to the melting Mood  As to Mrs  Wilkins  e dropt her Pearls as fast  as the Arabian Trees their Medicinal Gums  for this was a Cermonial which that Gentlewoman never omitted on a proper Occasion  After this Mr  Allworthy  again laid himself down  n his Pillow and endeavoured to compose himself  o Rest  CHAP VIII  Containing Matter rather natural than pleasing  BESIDES Grief for her Master there was another Source for that briny Stream which so  entifully rose above the two Mountainous Cheek  ones of the Housekeeper She was no sooner re  ed than she began to mutter to herself in the following pleasant Strain 'Sure Master might have made some Difference methinks between me and the other Servants I suppose he hath left me Mourning but ifackins if that be all the Devil shall wear it for me I'd have his Worship know I am no Beggar I have saved five hundred Pound in his Service and after all to be used in this Manner It is a fine Encouragement to Servants to be honest and to be sure if I have taken a little something now and then others have taken ten times as much and now we are all put in a Lump together If so be that it be so the Legacy may go to the  Devil with him that gave it No I won't give up neither because that will please some Folks No I'll buy the gayest Gown I can get and dan  over the old Curmugeon's Grave in it This i  my Reward for taking his Part so often when a  the Country have cried Shame of him for breeding up his Bastard in that Manner but he is going now where he must pay for all It would have be comed him better to have repented of his Sins o  his DeathBed than to glory in them and give  way his Estate out of his own Family to a misbe gotten Child Found in his Bed forsooth A pre  ty Story Ay ay those that hide know where  find Lord forgive him I warrant he hath man more Bastards to answer for if the Truth wa  known One Comfort is they will all be know where he is a going now 'The Servants will fi  some Token to remember me by' Those we  the very Words I shall never forget them it was to live a thousand Years Ay ay I shall remember you for huddling me among the Servant One would have thought he might have mention my Name as well as that of  Square  but he is Gentleman forsooth though he had not Clothes his Back when he came hither first Marry co  up with such Gentlemen though he hath lived he  these many Years I don't believe there is  arr  Servant in the House ever saw the Colour of  Money The Devil shall wait upon such Gentlemen for me' Much more of the like kind she muttered to herself but this Taste shall suffice to the Reader  Neither  Thwackum  nor  Square  were much bet  satisfied with their Legacies Tho' they breath not their Resentment so loud yet from the Discont  which appeared in their Countenances as well from the following Dialogue we collect that no g  Pleasure reigned in their Minds  About an Hour after they had left the sick Room  quare  met  Thwackum  in the Hall and accosted him  us 'Well Sir have you heard any News of your Friend since we parted from him 'If you mean Mr  Allworthy'  answered  Thwackum  'I think you might rather give him the Appellation of your Friend For he seems to me to have deserved that Title' 'The Title is as good on your Side' re  lied  Square  'for his Bounty such as it is hath been equal to both' 'I should not have mentioned it first' cries  Thwackum  'but since you begin I must inform you I am of a Different Opinion There is a wide Distinction between voluntary Favours and Rewards The Duty I have done in his Family and the Care I have taken in the Education of his two Boys are Services for which some Men might have expected a greater Return I would not have you imagine I am therefore dissatisfied for St  Paul  hath taught me to be content with the little I have Had the Modicum been less I should have known my Duty But though the Scripture obliges me to remain contented it doth not enjoin me to shut my Eyes to my own Merit nor restrain me from seeing when I am injured by an unjust Comparison Since you provoke me' re  urned  Square  'that Injury is done to me Nor did I ever imagine Mr  Allworthy  had held my Friendship so light as to put me in Ballance with one who received his Wages I know to what it is owing it proceeds from those narrow Principles which you have been so long endeavouring to infuse into him in Contempt of every Thing which is great and noble The Beauty and Loveliness of Friendship is too strong for dim Eyes nor can it be perceived by any other Medium than that unerring Rule of Right which you have so often endeavoured to ridicule that you have perverted my Friend's Understanding' 'I wish' cries  Thwackum  in a Rage  'I wish for the Sake of his Soul your damnabl  Doctrines have not perverted his Faith It is  this I impute his present Behaviour so unbecoming a Christian Who but an Athiest could think  leaving the World without having first made up h  Account without confessing his Sins and receiving that Absolution which he knew he had one  the House duly authorised to give him He w  feel the Want of these Necessaries when it is to late When he is arrived at the Place where the  is Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth It is then  will find in what mighty Stead that Heathen Goddess that Virtue which you and all other Deists  the Age adore will stand him He will then summon his Priest when there is none to be found as will lament the Want of that Absolution without which no Sinner can be safe' 'If it be so materia  says  Square  Why don't you present it him  'your own Accord' 'It hath no Virtue' cri  Thwackum  'but to those who have sufficient Gra  to require it But why do I talk thus to a Heath  and an Unbeliever It is you who have taught h  this Lesson for which you have been wellrewared in this World as I doubt not your Disciple w  soon be in the other' 'I know not what y  mean by my Reward' said  Square  'but if you h  at that pitiful Memorial of our Friendship which  hath thought fit to bequeath me I despise it a  nothing but the unfortunate Situation of my C  cumstances should prevail on me to accept it  The Physician now arrived and began to enqu  of the two Disputants  How we all did above Stair  'In a miserable Way' answered  Thwackum  '  is no more than I expected' cries the Doctor but pray what Symptoms have appeared since left you No good ones I am afraid' repl  Thwackum  'after what past at our Departure  think there were little Hopes' The Bodily Phy  cian perhaps misunderstood the Curer of Souls and before they came to an Explanation Mr  Blifil  ame to them with a most melancholy Counte  ance and acquainted them that he brought sad News for that his Mother was dead at  Salisbury  That she  ad been seized on the Road home with the Gout  n her Head and Stomach which had carried her off  n a few Hours 'Goodlackaday' says the Doc  or 'One cannot answer for Events but I wish I  had been at Hand to have been called in The  Gout is a Distemper which is difficult to treat yet  I have been remarkably successful in it'  Thwackum  and  Square  both condoled with Mr  Blifil  for the Loss of his Mother which the one advised him to  ear like a Man and the other like a Christian The young Gentleman said he knew very well we were all mortal and he would endeavour to submit to his Loss as well as he could That he could not however help complaining a little against the peculiar Severity of his Fate which brought the News of so great  Calamity to him by Surprize and that at a Time when he hourly expected the severest Blow he was  apable of feeling from the Malice of Fortune He did the present Occasion would put to the Test those  xcellent Rudiments which he had learnt from Mr  Thwackum  and Mr  Square  and it would be entirely owing to them if he was enabled to survive such Misfortunes  It was now debated whether Mr  Allworthy  should be informed of the Death of his Sister This the Doctor violent opposed in which I believe the whole College will agree with him but Mr  Blifil  said he had received such positive and repeated Orders from his Uncle never to keep any Secret from him for Fear of the Disquietude which it might give him that he durst not think of Disobedience whatever might be the Consequence He said for his Part  considering the religious and philosophic Temper o  his Uncle he could not agree with the Doctor in h  Apprehensions He was therefore resolved to communicate it to him For if his Uncle recovered as h  heartily prayed he might he knew he would never forgive an Endeavour to keep a Secret of this Kind from him  The Physician was forced to submit to these Resolutions which the two other learned Gentlemen very highly commended So together moved Mr  Blifil  and the Doctor towards the sick Room whe  the Physician first entered and approached the Be  in order to feel his Patient's Pulse which he had n  sooner done than he declared he was much better that the last Application had succeeded to a Miracle and had brought the Fever to intermit So that h  said there appeared now to be as little Danger as h  had before apprehended there were Hopes  To say the Truth Mr  Alworthy'  s Situation ha  never been so bad as the great Caution of the Docto  had represented it but as a wise General never despises his Enemy however inferior his Force ma  be so neither doth a wise Physician ever despise Distemper however inconsiderable As the forme  preserves the same strict Discipline places the sam  Guards and employs the same Scouts tho' the Enemy be never so weak so the latter maintains the sam  Gravity of Countenance and shakes his Head wi  the same significant Air let the Distemper be neve  so trifling And both among many other goo  ones may assign this solid Reason for their Conduct that by these Means the greater Glory redounds  them if they gain the Victory and the less Disgrac  if by any unlucky Accident they should happen to b  conquered  Mr  Allworthy  had no sooner lifted up his Eye and thanked Heaven for these Hopes of his Recovery than Mr  Blifil  drew near with a very dejected Aspect  a  and having applied his Handkerchief to his Eye either to wipe away his Tears or as  Ovid  somewhere expresses himself on another Occasion  Si nullus erit tamen excute nullum  'If there be none wipe away that none  he communicated to his Uncle what the Reader hath been just before acquainted with  Allworthy  received the News with Concern with Patience and with Resignation He dropt a tender Tear then composed his Countenance and at last cried 'The Lord's Will be done in every Thing'  He now enquired for the Messenger but  Blifil  told him it had been impossible to detain him a Moment for he appeared by the great Hurry he was into have some Business of Importance on his Hands That he complained of being hurried and driven and torn out of his Life and repeated many Times that if he could divide himself into four Quarters he knew how to dispose of every one  Allworthy  then desired  Blifil  to take Care of the Funeral He said he would have his Sister deposited in his own Chapel and as to the Particulars he left them to his own Discretion only mentioning the Person whom he would have employed on this Occasion  CHAP IX  Which among other Things may serve as a Comment on that Saying of  Aeschines  that  DRUNKENNESS SHEWS THE MIND OF A MAN AS A MIRROUR REFLECTS HIS PERSON  THE Reader may perhaps wonder at hearing nothing of Mr  Jones  in the last Chapter In fact his Behaviour was so different from that of the Persons there mentioned that we chose not to confound his Name with theirs  When the good Man had ended his Speech  Jones  was the last who deserted the Room Thence he  retired to his own Apartment to give Vent to h  Concern but the Restlessness of his Mind would not suffer him to remain long there he slipped softly therefore to  Allworthy'  s Chamber Door where  listened a considerable Time without hearing and Kind of Motion within unless a violent snoring which at last his Fears misrepresented as Groans This alarmed him that he could not forbear entering th  Room where he found the Good Man in the Be  in a sweet composed Sleep and his Nurse snoring  the abovementioned hearty Manner at the Bed's Fee  He immediately took the only Method of silencin  this thorough Bass whose Music he feared might disturb Mr  Allworthy  and then sitting down by th  Nurse he remained motionless till  Blifil  and the Do  ter came in together and waked the sick Man order that the Doctor might feel his Pulse and tha  the other might communicate to him that Piece o  News which had  Jones  been apprized of it would have had great Difficulty of finding its Way to Mr  Allworthy'  s Ear at such a Season  When he first heard  Blifil  tell his Uncle this Story  Jones  could hardly contain the Wrath which kindle  in him at the other's Indiscretion especially as th  Doctor shook his Head and declared his Unwillingness to have the Matter mentioned to his Patient But as his Passion did not so far deprive him of all Use of his Understanding as to hide from him the Consequences which any violent Expressions towards  Blifil  might have on the Sick this Apprehension stilled his Rage at the present and he grew afterward so satisfied with finding that his News had in fact produced no Mischief that he suffered his Anger to die in his own Bosom without ever mentioning it to  Blifil  The Physician dined that Day at Mr  Allworthy'  s and having after Dinner visited his Patient he return+ed to the Company and told them that he had not  the Satisfaction to say with Assurance that his Patient was out of all Danger That he had brought his Fever to a perfect Intermission and doubted not by throwing in the Bark to prevent its return  This Account so pleased  Jones  and threw him into such immoderate Excess of Rapture that he might be truly said to be drunk with Joy An Intoxication which greatly forwards the Effects of Wine and as he was very free too with the Bottle on this Occasion for he drank many Bumpers to the Doctor's Health as well as to other Toasts he became very soon literally drunk  Jones  had naturally violent animal Spirits These being set on Float and augmented by the Spirit of Wine produced most extravagant Effects He kissed the Doctor and embraced him with the most passionate Endearments swearing that next to Mr  Allworthy  himself he loved him of all Men living' 'Doctor' added he 'you deserve a Statue to be erected to you at the public Expence for having preserved a Man who is not only the Darling of all good Men who know him but a Blessing to Society the Glory of his Country and an Honour to human Nature Dn me if I don't love him better than my own Soul'  'More shame for you' cries  Thwackum  'Though I think you have reason to love him for he hath provided very well for you And perhaps it might have been better for some Folks that he had not lived to see just Reason of revoking his Gift'  Jones  now looking on  Thwackum  with inconceivable Disdain answered 'And doth thy mcan Soul imagine that any such Considerations could weigh with me No let the Earth open and swallow her own Dirt if I had Millions of Acres I would say it rather than swallow up my dear glorious Friend'  Quis Desiderio sit Pudor aut modus  Tam chari Capitis  'What Modesty or Measure can set Bounds to our Desire of so dear a Friend'  The Word  Desiderium  here cannot be easily translated It includes our Desire of enjoying our Friend again and the Grief which attends that Desire  The Doctor now interposed and prevented the Effects of a Wrath which was kindling between  Jones  and  Thwackum  after which the former gave a Loose to Mirth sang two or three amorous Songs and fell into every frantic Disorder which unbridled Joy is apt to inspire but so far was he from any Disposition to quarrel that he was ten times better humoured if possible than when he was sober  To say Truth nothing is more erroneous than the common Observation That Men who are illnatured and quarrelsome when they are drunk are very worthy Persons when they are sober For Drink in reality doth not reverse Nature or create Passions in Men which did not exist in them before It takes away the Guard of Reason and consequently forces us to produce those Symptoms which many when sober have Art enough to conceal It heightens and inflames our Passions generally indeed that Passion which is uppermost in our Mind so that the angry Temper the amorous the generous the good humoured the avaricious and all other Dispositions of Men are in their Cups heightened and exposed  And yet as no Nation produces so many drunken Quarrels especially among the lower People as  England  for indeed with them to drink and to fight together are almost synonimous Terms I would not methinks have it thence concluded that the  English  are the worstnatured People alive Perhaps the Love of Glory only is at the Bottom of this so that the fair Conclusion seems to be that our Countrymen have more of that Love and more of  Bravery than any other Plebeians And this the rather as there is seldom any thing ungenerous unfair or illnatured exercised on those Occasions Nay it is common for the Combatants to express Goodwill for each other even at the Time of the Conflict and as their drunken Mirth generally ends in a Battle so do most of their Battles end in Friendship  But to return to our History Tho'  Jones  had shewn no Design of giving Offence yet Mr  Blifil  was highly offended at a Behaviour which was so inconsistent with the sober and prudent Reserve of his own Temper He bore it too with the greater Impatience as it appeared to him very indecent at this Season 'when' as he said 'the House was a House of Mourning on the Account of his dear Mother and if it had pleased Heaven to give them some Prospect of Mr  Allworthy'  s Recovery it would become them better to express the Exultations of their Hearts in Thanksgiving than in Drunkenness and Riots which were properer Methods to encrease the divine Wrath than to avert it'  Thwackum  who had swallowed more Liquor than  Jones  but without any ill Effect on his Brain seconded the pious Harangue of  Blifil  but  Square  for Reasons which the Reader may probably guess was totally silent  Wine had not so totally overpowered  Jones  as to prevent his recollecting on Mr  Blifil'  s Loss the Moment it was mentioned As no Person therefore was more ready to confess and condemn his own Errors he offered to shake Mr  Blifil  by the Hand and begged his Pardon saying 'His excessive Joy for Mr  Allworthy'  s Recovery had driven every other Thought out of his Mind'  Blifil  scornfully rejected his Hand and with much Indignation answered 'It was little to be wondered at if tragical Spectacles made no Impressions on the Blind but for his Part he had the Misfortune  to know who his Parents were and consequently must be affected with their Loss'  Jones  who notwithstanding his good Humour had some Mixture of the irascible in his Constitution leaped hastily from his Chair and catching hold of  Blifil'  s Collar cried out 'Dn you for a Rascal do you insult me with the Misfortune of my Birth' He accompanied these Words with such rough Actions that they soon got the better of Mr  Blifil'  s peaceable Temper and a Scuffle immediately ensued which might have produced Mischief had it not been prevented by the Interposition of  Thwackum  and the Physician for the Philosophy of  Square  rendered him superior to all Emotions and he very calmly smoaked his Pipe as was his Custom in all Broils unless when he apprehended some Danger of having it broke in his Mouth  The Combatants being now prevented from executing present Vengeance on each other betook themselves to the common Resources of disappointed Rage and vented their Wrath in Threats and Defiance In this kind of Conflict Fortune which in the personal Attack seemed to incline to  Jones  was now altogether as favourable to his Enemy  A Truce nevertheless was at length agreed on by the Mediation of the neutral Parties and the whole Company again sat down at the Table where  Jones  being prevailed on to ask Pardon and  Blifil  to give it Peace was restored and every thing seemed in  Statu quo  But though the Quarrel was in all Appearance perfectly reconciled the good humour which had been interrupted by it was by no means restored All Merriment was now at an End and the subsequent Discourse consisted only of grave Relations of Matters of Fact and of as grave Observations upon them A Species of Conversation in which though there is much of Dignity and Instruction there is but little Entertainment  As we presume therefore only to convey this last to the Reader we shall pass by whatever was said till the rest of the Company having by Degrees dropped off left  Square  and the Physician only together at which Time the Conversation was a little heightened by some Comments on what had happened between the two young Gentlemen both of whom the Doctor declared to be no better than Scoundrels to which Appellation the Philosopher very sagaciously shaking his Head agreed  CHAP X  Shewing the Truth of many Observations of  Ovid  and of other more grave Writers who have proved beyond Contradiction that Wine is often the Forerunner of Incontinency  JONES  retired from the Company in which we have seen him engaged into the Fields where he intended to cool himself by a Walk in the open Air before he attended Mr  Allworthy  There whilst he renewed those Meditations on his dear  Sophia  which the dangerous Illness of his Friend and Benefactor had for some time interrupted an Accident happened which with Sorrow we relate and with Sorrow doubtless will it be read however that historic Truth to which we profess so inviolable an Attachment obliges us to communicate it to Posterity  It was now a pleasant Evening in the latter End of  June  when our Heroe was walking in a most delicious Grove where the gentle Breezes fanning the Leaves together with the sweet Trilling of a murmuring Stream and the melodious Notes of Nightingales formed all together the most enchanting Harmony In this Scene so sweetly accommodated to Love he meditated on his dear  Sophia  While his wanton Fancy roved unbounded over all her Beauties and his lively Imagination painted the charming Maid in various ravishing Forms his warm Heart melted  with Tenderness and at length throwing himself on the ground by the Side of a gentle murmuring Brook he broke forth into the following Ejaculation  'O  Sophia  would Heaven give thee to my Arms how blest would be my Condition Curst be that Fortune which sets a Distance between us Was I but possessed of thee one only Suit of Rags thy whole Estate is there a Man on Earth whom I would envy How contemptible would the brightest  Circassian  Beauty drest in all the Jewels of the  Indies  appear to my Eyes But why do I mention another Woman could I think my Eyes capable of looking at any other with Tenderness these Hands should tear them from my Head No my  Sophia  if cruel Fortune separates us for ever my Soul shall doat on thee alone The chastest Constancy will I ever preserve to thy Image Tho' I should never have Possession of thy charming Person still shalt thou alone have Possession of my Thoughts my Love my Soul Oh my fond Heart is so wrapt in that tender Bosom that the brightest Beauties would for me have no Charms nor would a hermit be colder in their Embraces  Sophia Sophia  alone shall be mine What Raptures are in that Name I will engrave it on every Tree'  At these Words he started up and beholdnot his  Sophia  no nor a  Circassian  Maid richly and elegantly attired for the Grand Signior's Seraglio No without a Gown in a Shift that was somewhat of the coarsest and none of the cleanest bedewed likewise with some odoriferous Effluvia the Produce of the Day's Labour with a Pitchfork in her Hand  Molly Seagrim  approached Our Hero had his Penknife in his Hand which he had drawn for the beforementioned Purpose of carving on the Bark when the Girl coming near him cry'd out with a Smile 'You don't intend to kill me Squire I hope' 'Why should you think I would kill you' answered  Jones  'Nay' replied she 'after your cruel Usage of me when I saw you last killing me would perhaps be too great Kindness for me to expect'  Here ensued a Parly which as I do not think myself obliged to relate I shall omit It is sufficient that it lasted a full Quarter of an Hour at the Conclusion of which they retired into the thickest Part of the Grove  Some of my Readers may be inclined to think this Event unnatural However the Fact is true and perhaps may be sufficiently accounted for by suggesting that  Jones  probably thought one Woman better than none and  Molly  as probably imagined two Men to be better than one Besides the before mentioned Motive assigned to the present Behaviour of  Jones  the Reader will be likewise pleased to recollect in his Favour that he was not at this Time perfect Master of that wonderful Power of Reason which so well enables grave and wise Men to subdue their unruly Passions and to decline any of these prohibited Amusements Wine now had totally subdued this Power in  Jones  He was indeed in a Condition in which if Reason had interposed tho' only to advise she might have received the Answer which one  Cleostratus  gave many Years ago to a silly Fellow who asked him if he was not ashamed to be drunk 'Are not you' said  Cleostratus  'ashamed to admonish a drunken Man'To say the Truth in a Court of Justice Drunkenness must not be an Excuse yet in a Court of Conscience it is greatly so and therefore  Aristotle  who commends the Laws of  Pittacus  by which drunken Men received double Punishment for their Crimes allows there is more of Policy than Justice in that Law Now if there are any Transgressions pardonable from Drunkenness they are certainly such as Mr  Jones  was at present guilty of on which Head I could pour forth a vast Profusion of Learning if I imagined it would either entertain my  Reader or teach him any Thing more than he knows already For his Sake therefore I shall keep my Learning to myself and return to my History  It hath been observed that Fortune seldom doth▪ Things by Halves To say Truth there is no  End to her Freaks whenever she is disposed to gratify or displease No sooner had our Heroe retired with his  Dido  but  Speluncam  Blifil  Dux et Divinus eandem  Deveniunt  the Parson and the young 'Squire who were taking a serious Walk arrived at the Stile which leads into the Grove and the latter caught a View of the Lovers just as they were sinking out of Sight  Blifil  knew  Jones  very well tho' he was at above a hundred Yards Distance and he was as positive to the Sex of his Companion tho' not to the individual Person He started blessed himself and uttered a very solemn Ejaculation  Thwackum  express'd some Surprize at these sudden Emotions and asked the Reason of them To which  Blifil  answered 'he was certain he had seen a Fellow and Wench retire together among the Bushes which he doubted not was with some wicked Purpose' As to the Name of  Jones  he thought proper to conceal it and why he did so must be left to the Judgment of the sagacious Reader For we never chuse to assign Motives to the Actions of Men when there is any possibility of our being mistaken  The Parson who was not only strictly chaste in his own Person but a great Enemy to the opposite Vice in all others fired at this Information He desired Mr  Blifil  to conduct him immediately to the Place which as he approached he breathed forth Vengeance mixed with Lamentations nor did he refrain from casting some oblique Reflections on Mr  Allworthy  insinuating that the Wickedness of the  Country was principally owing to the Encouragement he had given to Vice by having exerted such Kindness to a Bastard and by having mitigated that just and wholsome Rigour of the Law which allots a very severe Punishment to loose Wenches  The Way through which our Hunters were to pass in pursuit of their Game was so beset with Briars that it greatly obstructed their Walk and caused besides such a rustling that  Jones  had sufficient Warning of their Arrival before they could surprize him nay indeed so incapable was  Thwackum  of concealing his Indignation and such Vengeance did he mutter forth every Step he took that this alone must have abundantly satisfied  Jones  that he was to use the Language of Sportsmen  found sitting  CHAP XI  In which a Simile in Mr  Pope  's Period of a Mile introduces as bloody a Battle as can possibly be fought without the Assistance of Steel or  cold  Iron  AS in the Season of RUTTING an uncouth Phrase by which the Vulgar denote that gentle Dalliance which in the  This is an ambiguous Phrase and may mean either a Forest well cloathed with Wood or well stript of it  wellwooded Forest of  Hampshire  passes between Lovers of the Ferine Kind if while the lofty chrested Stag meditates the amorous Sport a Couple of Puppies or any other Beasts of hostile Note should wander so near the Temple of  Venus Ferina  that the fair Hind should shrink from the Place touched with that somewhat either of Fear or Frolic of Nicety or Skittishness with which Nature hath bedecked all Females or hath at least instructed them how themselves to put on lest thro' the Indelicacy of Males the  Samean  Mysteries should be pryed into by unhallowed Eyes For at the celebration of these Rites the female Priestess  cries out with her in  Virgil  who was then probably hard at Work on such Celebration  Procul O procul este profani  Proclamat Vates totoque absistite Luco  Far hence be Souls profane  The Sibyl cry'd and from the Grove abstain  DRYDEN  If I say while these sacred Rites which are in common to  Genus omne Animantium  are in Agitation between the Stag and his Mistress any hostile Beasts should venture too near on the first Hint given by the frighted Hind fierce and tremendous rushes forth the Stag to the Entrance of the Thicket there stands he Centinel over his Love stamps the Ground with his Foot and with his Horns brandished aloft in Air proudly provokes the apprehended Foe to Combat  Thus and more terrible when he perceived the Enemy's Approach leaped forth our Heroe Many a Step advanced he forwards in order to conceal the trembling Hind and if possible to secure her Retreat And now  Thwackum  having first darted some livid Lightning from his fiery Eyes began to thunder forth 'Fie upon it Fie upon it Mr  Jones  Is it possible you should be the Person' 'You see' answered  Jones  'it is possible I should be here' 'And who' said  Thwackum  'is that wicked Slut with you' 'If I have any wicked Slut with me' cries  Jones  it is possible I shall not let you know who she is' 'I command you to tell me immediately' says  Thwackum  'and I would not have you imagine young Man that your Age tho' it hath somewhat abridged the Purpose of Tuition hath totally taken away the Authority of the Master The Relation of the Master and Scholar is indelible as indeed all other Relations are For they all derive their Original from Heaven I would have you think yourself therefore as much obliged to obey me  now as when I taught you your first Rudiments' 'I believe you would' cries  Jones  'but that will not happen unless you had the same Birchen Argument to convince me' 'Then I must tell you plainly' said  Thwackum  'I am resolved to discover the wicked Wretch' 'And I must tell you plainly' returned  Jones  'I am resolved you shall not'  Thwackum  then offered to advance and  Jones  laid hold of his Arms which Mr  Blifil  endeavoured to rescue declaring 'he would not see his old Master insulted'  Jones  now finding himself engaged with two thought it necessary to rid himself of one of his Antagonists as soon as possible He therefore applied to the weakest first and letting the Parson go he directed a Blow at the young Squire's Breast which luckily taking Place reduced him to measure his Length on the Ground  Thwackum  was so intent on the Discovery that the Moment he found himself at Liberty he stept forward directly into the Fern without any great Consideration of what might in the mean Time befal his Friend but he had advanced a very few Paces into the Thicket before  Jones  having defeated  Blifil  overtook the Parson and dragged him backward by the Skirt of his Coat  This Parson had been a Champion in his Youth and had won much Honour by his Fist both at School and at the University He had now indeed for a great Number of Years declined the practice of that noble Art yet was his Courage full as strong as his Faith and his Body no less strong than either He was moreover as the Reader may perhaps have conceived somewhat irascible in his Nature When he looked back therefore and saw his Friend stretched out on the Ground and found himself at the same Time so roughly handled by one who had formerly  been only passive in all Conflicts between them a Circumstance which highly aggravated the whole his Patience at length gave Way he threw himself into a Posture of Offence and collecting all his Force attacked  Jones  in the Front with as much Impetuosity as he had formerly attacked him in the Rear  Our Heroe received the Enemy's Attack with the most undaunted Intrepidity and his Bosom resounded with the Blow This he presently returned with no less Violence aiming likewise at the Parson's Breast but he dextrously drove down the Fist of  Jones  so that it reached only his Belly where two Pounds of Beef and as many of Pudding were then deposited and whence consequently no hollow Sound could proceed Many lusty Blows much more pleasant as well as easy to have seen than to read or describe were given on both Sides at last a violent Fall in which  Jones  had thrown his Knees into  Thwackum'  s Breast so weakened the latter that Victory had been no longer dubious had not  Blifil  who had now recovered his Strength again renewed the Fight and by engaging with  Jones  given the Parson a Moment's Time to shake his Ears and to regain his Breath  And now both together attacked our Heroe whose Blows did not retain that Force with which they had fallen at first so weakened was he by his Combat with  Thwackum  For though the Pedagogue chose rather to play  Solos  on the human Instrument and had been lately used to those only yet he still retained enough of his ancient Knowledge to perform his Part very well in a  Duet  The Victory according to modern Custom was like to be decided by Numbers when on a sudden a fourth Pair of Fists appeared in the Battle and immediately paid their Compliments to the Parson the Owner of them at the same Time crying out' Are not you ashamed and be dnd to you to fall two of you upon one  The Battle which was of the Kind that for Distinction's Sake is called ROYAL now raged with the utmost Violence during a few Minutes till  Blifil  being a second Time laid sprawling by  Jones Thwachum  condescended to apply for Quarter to his new Antagonist who was now found to be Mr  Western  himself For in the Heat of the Action none of the Combatants had recognized him  In Fact that honest 'Squire happening in his Afternoon's Walk with some Company to pass through the Field where the bloody Battle was fought and having concluded from seeing three Men engaged that two of them must be on a Side he hastened from his Companions and with more Gallantry than Policy espoused the Cause of the weaker Party By which generous Proceeding he very probably prevented Mr  Jones  from becoming a Victim to the Wrath of  Thwackum  and to the pious Friendship which  Blifil  bore his old Master For besides the Disadvantage of such Odds  Jones  had not yet sufficiently recovered the former Strength of his broken Arm This Reinforcement however soon put an End to the Action and  Jones  with his Ally obtained the Victory  CHAP XII  In which is seen a more moving Spectacle than all the Blood in the Bodies of  Thwackum  and  Blifil  and of twenty other such is capable of producing  THE rest of Mr  Western'  s Company were now come up being just at the Instant when the Action was over These were the honest Clergyman whom we have formerly seen at Mr  Western'  s Table Mrs  Western  the Aunt of  Sophia  and lastly the lovely  Sophia  herself  At this Time the following was the Aspect of the bloody Field In one Place lay on the Ground  all pale and almost breathless the vanquished  Blifil  Near him stood the Conqueror  Jones  almost covered with Blood part of which was naturally his own and part had been lately the Property of the Reverend Mr  Thwackum  In a third Place stood the said  Thwackum  like King  Porus  sullenly submitting to the Conqueror The last Figure in the Piece was  Western the Great  most gloriously forbearing the vanquished Foe  Blifil  in whom there was little Sign of Life was at first the principal Object of the Concern of every one and particularly of Mrs  Western  who had drawn from her Pocket a Bottle of Hartshorn and was herself about to apply it to his Nostrils when on a sudden the Attention of the whole Company was diverted from poor  Blifil  whose Spirit if it had any such Design might have now taken an Opportunity of stealing off to the other World without any Ceremony  For now a more melancholy as more lovely Object lay motionless before them This was no other than the charming  Sophia  herself who from the Sight of Blood or from Fear of her Father or from some other Reason had fallen down in a Swoon before any one could get to her Assistance  Mrs  Western  first saw her and screamed Immediately two or three Voices cried out 'Miss  Western  is dead' Hartshorn Water every Remedy was called for almost at one and the same Instant  The Reader may remember that in our Description of this Grove we mentioned a murmuring Brook which Brook did not come there as such gentle Streams flow through vulgar Romances with no other Purpose than to murmur No Fortune had decreed to enoble this little Brook with a higher Honour than any of those which wash the Plains of  Arcadia  ever deserved  Jones  was rubbing  Blifil'  s Temples For he began to fear he had given him a Blow too much when the Words Miss  Western  and Death rushed at once on his Ear He started up left  Blifil  to his Fate and flew to  Sophia  whom while all the rest were running against each other backward and forward looking for Water in the dry Paths he caught up in his Arms and then ran away with her over the Field to the Rivulet abovementioned where plunging himself into the Water he contrived to besprinkle her Face Head and Neck very plentifully  Happy was it for  Sophia  that the same Confusion which prevented her other Friends from serving her prevented them likewise from obstructing  Jones  He had carried her half ways before they knew what he was doing and he had actually restored her to Life before they reached the Waterside She stretched out her Arms opened her Eyes and cried 'Oh Heavens' just as her Father Aunt and the Parson came up  Jones  who had hitherto held this lovely Burthen in his Arms now relinquished his Hold but gave her at the same Instant a tender Caress which had her Senses been then perfectly restored could not have escaped her Observation As she expressed therefore no Displeasure at this Freedom we suppose she was not sufficiently recovered from her Swoon at the Time  This tragical Scene was now converted into a sudden Scene of Joy In this our Heroe was most certainly the principal Character For he probably felt more extatic Delight in having saved  Sophia  than she herself received from being saved so neither were the Congratulations paid to her equal to what were conferred on  Jones  especially by Mr  Western  himself who after having once or twice embraced his Daughter fell to hugging and kissing  Jones  He called him the preserver of  Sophia  and declared there was nothing except her or his Estate which he  would not give him but upon Recollection he afterwards excepted his Foxhounds the Chevalier and Miss  Slouch  for so he called his favourite Mare  All Fears for  Sophia  being now removed  Jones  became the Object of the 'Squire's Consideration 'Come my Lad' says  Western 'D'off  thy  Quoat  and wash thy  Feace  For  att  in a devilish Pickle I promise thee Come come wash thyself and  shat  go  Huome  with me and  wel zee  to  vind  thee another  Quoat  '  Jones  immediately complied threw off his Coat went down to the Water and washed both his Face and Bosom For the latter was as much exposed and as bloody as the former But tho' the Water could clear off the Blood it could not remove the Black and blue Marks which  Thwackum  had imprinted on both his Face and Breast and which being discerned by  Sophia  drew from her a Sigh and a look full of inexpressible Tenderness  Jones  received this full in his Eyes and it had infinitely a stronger Effect on him than all the Contusions which he had received before An Effect however widely different for so soft and balmy was it that had all his former Blows been Stabs it would for some Minutes have prevented his feeling their Smart  The Company now moved backwards and soon arrived where  Thwackum  had got Mr  Blifil  again on his Legs Here we cannot suppress a pious Wish that all Quarrels were to be decided by those Weapons only with which Nature knowing what is proper for us hath supplied us and that cold Iron was to be used in digging no Bowels but those of the Earth Then would War the Pastime of Monarchs be almost inoffensive and Battles between great Armies might be fought at the particular Desire of several Ladies of Quality who together with the Kings themselves might be actual Spectators of  the Conflict Then might the Field be this Moment well strewed with human Carcasses and the next  he dead Men or infinitely the greatest Part of them  ight get up like Mr  Bayes'  s Troops and march if either at the Sound of a Drum or a Fiddle as could be previously agreed on  I would avoid if possible treating this Matter lu  crously lest grave Men and Politicians whom I now to be offended at a Jest may cry Pish at it  ot in reality might not a Battle be as well decided  y the greater Number of broken Heads bloody  oses and black Eyes as by the greater Heaps of  angled and murdered human Bodies Might not Towns be contended for in the same Manner Indeed this may be too detrimental a Scheme to the  French  Interest since they would lose the Advantage  ey have over other Nations in the Superiority of  eir Engineers But when I consider the Gallantry and Generosity of that People I am persuaded they  ould never decline putting themselves upon a Par with their Adversary or as the Phrase is  making themselves his Match  But such Reformations are rather to be wished  an hoped for I shall content myself therefore with this short Hint and return to my Narrative  Western  began now to enquire into the original Rise  f this Quarrel To which neither  Blifil  nor  Jones  ave any Answer but  Thwackum  said surlily 'I believe the Cause is not far off if you beat the Bushes well you may find her' 'Find her' re  lied  Western  'what have you been fighting for a Wench' 'Ask the Gentleman in his Wastecoat there' said  Thwackum  'he best knows' 'Nay then' cries  Western  'it is a Wench certainlyAh  Tom Tom  thou art a liquorish Dogbut come Gentlemen be all Friends and go home with me and make final Peace over a Bottle' 'I  ask your Pardon Sir' says  Thwackum  'it is n  such slight Matter for a Man of my Character to be thus injuriously treated and buffetted by a Boy only because I would have done my Duty in endeavouring to detect and bring to Justice a wanton Harlot but indeed the principal Fault lies in Mr  Allworthy  and yourself For if you put the Laws in Execution as you ought to do you would soon ri  the Country of these Vermin'  'I would as soon rid the Country of Foxes' cries  Western  'I think we ought to encourage the recruiting those Numbers which we are every Day losing in the War But where is shePrithee  Tom  shew me' He then began to beat about in the same Language and in the same Manner as if he had been beating for a Hare and at last cried out 'Soho Puss is not far off Here's her Form upon my Soul I believe I may cry  stole away'  And indeed so he might for he had now discovered the Place whence the poor Girl had at the Beginning of the Fray  stolen away  upon as many Feet as a Hare generally uses in travelling  Sophia  now desired her Father to return home saying she found herself very faint and apprehended a Relapse The Squire immediately complied with his Daughter's Request for he was the fondest of Parents He earnestly endeavoured to prevail with the whole Company to go and sup with him but  Blifil  and  Thwackum  absolutely refused the former saying There were more Reasons than he could then mention why he must decline this Honour and the latter declaring perhaps rightly that it was not proper for a Person of his Function to be seen at any Place in his present Condition  Jones  was incapable of refusing the Pleasure of being with his  Sophia  So on he marched with Squire  Western  and his Ladies the Parson bringing up the Rear This had indeed offered to tarry with his  Brother  Thwackum  professing his Regard for the Cloth would not permit him to depart but  Thwackum  would not accept the Favour and with no great Civility pushed him after Mr  Western  Thus ended this bloody Fray and thus shall end the fifth Book of this History  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK VI  Containing about three Weeks  CHAP I  Of Love  IN our last Book we have been obliged to deal pretty much with the Passion of Love and in our succeeding Book shall be forced to handle this Subject still more largely It may not therefore in this Place be improper to apply ourselves to the Examination of that modern Doctrine by which certain Philosophers among many other wonderful Discoveries pretend to have found out that there is no such Passion in the human Breast  Whether these Philosophers be the same with that surprizing Sect who are honourably mentioned by the late Dr  Swift  as having by the mere Force of Genius alone without the least Assistance of any Kind of Learning or even Reading discovered that profound and invaluable Secret That there was no G  or whether they are not rather she same with those who some Years since very much alarmed the World by shewing that there were no such things as virtue or Goodness really existing in Human Nature and who deduced our best Actions from Pride I will not here presume to determine In reality I am inclined to suspect that all these several Finders of Truth are the very identical Men who are by others called the  Finders of Gold  The Method used in both these Searches after Truth and after Gold being indeed one and the same  viz  the searching rummaging and examining into a nasty Place indeed in the former Instances into the nastiest of all Places ABAD MIND  But though in this Particular and perhaps in their Success the Truthfinder and the Goldfinder may very properly be compared together yet in Modesty surely there can be no Comparison between the two for who ever heard of a Goldfinder that had the Impudence or Folly to assert from the ill Success of his Search that there was no such thing as Gold in the World Whereas the Truthfinder having raked out that  Jakes  his own Mind and being there capable of tracing no Ray of Divinity nor any thing virtuous or good or lovely or loving very fairly honestly and logically concludes that no such things exist in the whole Creation  To avoid however all Contention if possible with these Philosophers if they will be called so and to shew our own Disposition to accommodate Matters peaceably between us we shall here make them some Concessions which may possibly put an End to the Dispute  First we will grant that many Minds and perhaps those of the Philosophers are entirely free from the least Traces of such a Passion  Secondly That what is commonly called Love namely the Desire of satisfying a voracious Appetite  with a certain Quantity of delicate white human Flesh is by no Means that Passion for which I here contend This is indeed more properly Hunger  and as no Glutton is ashamed to apply the Word Love to his Appetite and to say he LOVES such and such Dishes so may the Lover of this Kind with equal Propriety say he HUNGERS after such and such Women  Thirdly I will grant which I believe will be a most acceptable Concession that this Love for which I am an Advocate though it satisfies itself in a much more delicate Manner doth nevertheless seek its own Satisfaction as much as the grossest of all our Appetites  And Lastly That this Love when it operates towards one of a different Sex is very apt towards its complete Gratification to call in the Aid of that Hunger which I have mentioned above and which it is so far from abating that it heightens all its Delights to a Degree scarce imaginable by those who have never been susceptible of any other Emotions than what have proceeded from Appetite alone  In return to all these Concessions I desire of the Philosophers to grant that there is in some I believe in many human Breasts a kind and benevolent Disposition which is gratified by contributing to the Happiness of others That in this Gratification alone as in Friendship in parental and filial Affection and indeed in general Philanthropy there is a great and exquisite Delight That if we will not call such Disposition Love we have no Name for it That though the Pleasures arising from such pure Love may be hightened and sweetened by the Assistance of amorous Desires yet the former can subsist alone nor are they destroyed by the Intervention of the latter Lastly That Esteem and Gratitude are the proper Motives to Love as Youth and Beauty are to Desire and therefore though such Desire may naturally cease  when Age or Sickness overtake its Object yet these  an have no Effect on Love nor ever shake or remove from a good Mind that Sensation or Passion which  ath Gratitude and Esteem for its Basis  To deny the Existence of a Passion of which we often see manifest Iustances seems to be very strange and absurd and can indeed proceed only from that selfAdmonition which we have mentioned above But how unfair is this Doth the Man who recog  izes in his own Heart no Traces of Avarice or Ambition conclude therefore that there are no such Passions in Human Nature Why will we not modestly observe the same Rule in judging of the Good as well as the Evil of others Or why in any Case will  e as  Shakespear  phrases it 'put the World in our own Person'  Predominant Vanity is I am afraid too much concerned here This is one Instance of that Adulation which we bestow on our own Minds and this almost universally For there is scarce any Man how much soever he may despise the Character of a Flatterer but will condescend in the meanest Manner to flatter himself  To those therefore I apply for the Truth of the above Observations whose own Minds can bear Testimony to what I have advanced  Examine your Heart my good Reader and resolve whether you do believe these Matters with me If you do you may now proceed to their Exemplification in the following Pages if you do not you have I assure you already read more than you have understood and it would be wiser to pursue your Business or your Pleasures such as they are than to throw away any more of your Time in reading what you can neither taste nor comprehend To treat of the Effects of Love to you must be as absurd as to discourse on Colours to a Man born blind since possibly your Idea of Love may be as absurd as that which we are told such blind Man once entertained of the Colour  Red that Colour seemed to him to be very much like the Sound of a Trumpet and Love probably may in your Opinion very greatly resemble a Dish o  Soup or a Sirloin of RoastBeef  CHAP II  The Character of Mrs  Western  Her great Learning and Knowledge of the World and an Instand of the deep Penetration which she derived from those Advantages  THE Reader hath seen Mr  Western  his Sister and Daughter with young  Jones  and the Parson going together to Mr  Western'  s House where the greater Part of the Company spent the Evening with much Joy and Festivity  Sophia  was indeed the only grave Person For as to  Jones  though Love had now gotten entire Possession of his Heart yet the pleasing Reflection on Mr  Allworthy'  s Recovery and the Presence of his Mistress joined to some tender Looks which she now and then could not refrain from giving him so elevated our Heroe that he joined the Mirth of the other three who were perhaps as good humoured People as any in the World  Sophia  retained the same Gravity of Countenance the next Morning at Breakfast whence she retired likewise earlier than usual leaving her Father and Aunt together The Squire took no Notice of this Change in his Daughter's Disposition To say the Truth though he was somewhat of a Politician and had been twice a Candidate in the Country Interest at an Election he was a Man of no great Observation His Sister was a Lady of a different Turn She had lived about the Court and had seen the World Hence she had acquired all that Knowledge which the said World usually communicates and was a perfect Mistress of Manners Customs Ceremonies and Fashions nor did her Erudition stop here She had considerably  improved her Mind by Study she had not only  ead all the modern Plays Operas Oratorios Poems and Romances in all which she was a Critic but  ad gone thro'  Rapin'  s History of  England Echard'  s Roman  History  and many  French Memoires pour ser  ir a l' Histoire  to these she had added most of the political Pamphlets and Journals published within the last twenty Years From which she had attained every competent Skill in Politics and could discourse very learnedly on the Affairs of  Europe  She was moreover excellently well skilled in the Doctrine of Amour and knew better than any body who and who were together A Knowledge which she the more easily attained as her Pursuit of it was never diverted by any Affairs of her own for either she had no Inclinations or these had never been sollicited which last is indeed very probable For her masculine Person which was near six Foot high added to her Manner and Learning possibly prevented the other Sex from regarding her notwithstanding her Petticoats in the Light of a Woman However as she had considered the Matter scientifically she perfectly well knew though she had never practised them all the Arts which fine Ladies use when they desire to give Encouragement or to conceal Liking with all the long Appendage of Smiles Ogles Glances  c  as they are at present practised in the Beaumonde To sum the whole no Species of Disguise or Affectation had escaped her Notice but as to the plain simple Workings of honest Nature as she had never seen any such she could know but little of them  By means of this wonderful Sagacity Mrs  Western  had now as she thought made a Discovery of something in the Mind of  Sophia  The first Hint of this she took from the Behaviour of the young Lady in the field of Battle and the Suspicion which she then conceived was greatly corroborated by some Observations which she had made that Evening and  the next Morning However being greatly cautious to avoid being found in a Mistake she carried the Secret a whole Fortnight in her Bosom giving only some oblique Hints by Simperings Winks Nods and now and then dropping an obscure Word which indeed sufficiently alarmed  Sophia  but did not at all affect her Brother  Being at length however thoroughly satisfied of the Truth of her Observation she took an Opportunity one Morning when she was alone with her Brother to interrupt one of his Whistles in the following Manner  'Pray Brother have you not observed something very extraordinary in my Niece lately' 'No not I' answered  Western  'Is any thing the Matter with the Girl I think there is' replies she 'and something of much Consequence too' 'Why she doth not complain of any Thing' cries  Western  'and she hath had the Small Pox' 'Brother' returned she 'Girls are liable to other Distempers besides the Small Pox and sometimes possibly to much worse' Here  Western  interrupted her with much Earnestness and begged her if any thing ailed his Daughter to acquaint him immediately adding 'she knew he loved her more than his own Soul and that he would send to the World's End for the best Physician to her' 'Nay nay answered she smiling 'the Distemper is not so terrible but I believe Brother you are convinced I know the World and I promise you I was never more deceived in my Life if my Niece be not most desperately in Love' 'How in Love' cries  Western  in a Passion 'in Love without acquainting me I'll disinherit her I'll turn her out of Doors stark naked without a Farthing Is all my Kindness vor'ur and vondness o'ur come to this to fall in Love without asking me Leave' 'But you will not' answered Mrs  Western  'turn this Daughter whom you love better than your own  Soul out of Doors before you know whether you shall approve her Choice Suppose she should have fixed on the very Person whom you yourself would wish I'hope you would not be angry then' 'No no' cries  Western  'that would make a Differrence If she marries the Man I would ha' her she may love whom she pleases I shan't trouble my Head about that' 'That is spoken' answered the Sister 'like a sensible Man but I believe the very Person she hath chosen would be the very Person you would chuse for her I will disclaim all Knowledge of the World if it is not so and I believe Brother you will allow I have some' 'Why lookee Sister' said  Western  'I do believe you have as much as any Woman and to be sure those are Women's Matters You know I don't love to hear you talk about Politics they belong to us and Petticoats should not meddle But come Who is the Man' 'Marry' said she 'you may find him out yourself if you please You who are so great a Politician can be at no great Loss The Judgment which can penetrate into the Cabinets of Princes and discover the secret Springs which move the great State Wheels in all the political Machines of  Europe  must surely with very little Difficulty find out what passes in the rude uninformed Mind of a Girl' 'Sister' cries the Squire 'I have often warned you not to talk the Court Gibberish to me I tell you I don't understand the Lingo but I can read a Journal or the  London Evening Post  Perhaps indeed there may be now and tan a Verse which I can't make much of because half the Letters are left out yet I know very well what is meant by that and that our Affairs don't go so well as they should do because of Bribery and Corruption I pity your Country Ignorance from my Heart' cries the Lady 'Do you' answered  Western  'and I pity your Town  Learning I had rather be any Thing than a Courtier and a Presbytcrian and a  Hanoverian  too as some People I believe are' 'If you mean me' answered she 'you know I am a Woman Brother and it signifies nothing what I am BesidesI do know you are a Woman' cries the Squire and its well for thee that at one if hadst been a Man I promise thee I had lent thee a  Flick  long ago' 'Ay there' said she 'in that  Flick  lies all your fancied Superiority Your Bodies and not your Brains are stronger than ours Believe me it is well for you that you are able to beat us or such is the Superiority of our Understanding we should make all of you what the brave and wise and witty and polite are alreadyour Slaves' I am glad I know your Mind' answered the Squire but we'll talk more of this Matter another Time At present do tell me what Man it is you mean about my Daughter' 'Hold a Moment' said she while I digest that sovereign Contempt I have for your Sex or else I ought to be too angry with you ThereI have made a Shift to gulp it down And now good politic Sir what think you of Mr  Blifil  Did she not faint away on seeing him lie breathless on the Ground Did she not after he was recovered turn pale again the Moment we came up to that Part of the Field where he stood And pray what else should be the Occasion of all her Melancholy that Night at Supper the next Morning and indeed ever since' "Fore  George'  cries the Squire 'now you mind me on't I remember it all It is certainly so and I am glad on't with all my Heart I knew  Sophy  was a good Girl and would not fall in Love to make me angry I was never more rejoiced in my Life For nothing can lie so handy together as our two Estates I had this Matter in my Head some Time ago for certainly the two Estates are in a Manner joined  together in Matrimony already and it would be a thousand Pities to part them It is true indeed there be larger Estates in the Kingdom but not in this County and I had rather bate something than marry my Daughter among Stangers and Foreigners Besides most o' zuch great Estates be in the Hands of Lords and I hate the very Name of  themmun  Well but Sister what would you advise me to do For I tell you Women know these Matters better than we do' 'O your humble Servant Sir' answered the Lady 'we are obliged to you for allowing us a Capacity in any Thing Since you are pleased then most politic Sir to ask my Advice I think you may propose the Match to  Allworthy  yourself There is no Indecorum in the Proposal's coming from the Parent of either Side King  Alcinous  in Mr  Pope'  s Odyssey offers his Daughter to  Ulysses  I need not caution so Politic a Person not to say that your Daughter is in Love that would indeed be against all Rules' 'Well' said the Squire' 'I will propose it but I shall certainly lend un a  Flick  if he refuse me' Fear not' cries Mrs  Western  'the Match is too advantageous to be refused' 'I don't know that' answered the Squire  'Allworthy  is a queer Bch and Money hath no Effect o' un' 'Brother' said the Lady your Politics astonish me Are you really to be imposed on by Professions Do you think Mr  Allworthy  hath more Contempt for Money than other Men because he professes more Such Credulity would better become one of us weak Women than that wise Sex which Heaven hath formed for Politicians Indeed Brother you would make a fine Plenipo to negotiate with the  French  They would soon persuade you that they take Towns out of mere defensive Principles' 'Sister' answered the Squire with much Scorn Let your Friends at Court answer for the Towns taken as you are a  Woman I shall lay no Blame upon you For I suppose they are wiser than to trust Women with Secrets' He accompanied this with so sarcastical a Laugh that Mrs  Western  could bear no longer She had been all this Time fretted in a tender Part for she was indeed very deeply skilled in these Matters and very violent in them and therefore burst forth in a Rage declared her Brother to be both a Clown and a Blockhead and that she would stay no longer in his House  The Squire tho' perhaps he had never read  Machiavel  was however in many Points a perfect Politician He strongly held all those wise Tenets which are so well inculcated in that PoliticoPeripatetic School of  ExchangeAlley  He knew the just Value and only Use of Meney  viz  to lay it up He was likewise well skilled in the exact Value of Reversions Expectations  c  and had often considered the Amount of his Sister's Fortune and the Chance which he or his Posterity had of inheriting it This he was infinitely too wise to sacrifice to a trifling Resentment When he found therefore he had carried Matters too far he began to think of reconciling them which was no very difficult Task as the Lady had great Affection for her Brother and still greater for her Niece and tho' too susceptible of an Affront offered to her Skill in Politics on which she much valued herself was a Woman of a very extraordinary good and sweet Disposition  Having first therefore laid violent Hands on the Horses for whose Escape from the Stable no Place but the Window was left open he next applied himself to his Sister softened and soothed her by unsaying all he had said and by Assertions directly contrary to those which had incensed her Lastly he summoned the Eloquence of  Sophia  to his Assistance who besides a most graceful and winning Address had the Advantage of being heard with great Favour and Partiality by her Aunt  The Result of the whole was a kind Smile from Mrs  Western  who said 'Brother you are absolutely a perfect  Croat  but as those have their Use in the Army of the Empress Queen so you likewise have some good in you I will therefore once more sign a Treaty of Peace with you and see that you do not infringe it on your Side at least as you are so excellent a Politician I may expect you will keep your Leagues like the  French  till your Interest calls upon you to break them'  CHAP III  Containing two Defiances to the Critics  THE Squire having settled Matters with his Sister as we have seen in the last Chapter was so greatly impatient to communicate the Proposal to  Allworthy  that Mrs  Western  had the utmost Difficulty to prevent him from visiting that Gentleman in his Sickness for this Purpose  Mr  Allworthy  had been engaged to dine with Mr  Western  at the Time when he was taken ill He was therefore no sooner discharged out of the Custody of Physic but he thought as was usual with him on all Occasions both the highest and the lowest of fulfilling his Engagement  In the Interval between the Time of the Dialogue in the last Chapter and this Day of public Entertainment  Sophia  had from certain obscure Hints thrown out by her Aunt collected some Apprehensions that the sagacious Lady suspected her Passion for  Jones  She now resolved to take this Opportunity of wiping out all such Suspicion and for that Purpose to put an entire Constraint on her Behaviour  First she endeavoured to conceal a throbbing melancholy Heart with the utmost Sprightliness in her Countenance and the highest Gayety in her Manner  Secondly she addressed her whole Discourse to Mr  Blifil  and took not the least Notice of poor  Jones  the whole Day  The Squire was so delighted with the Conduct of his Daughter that he scarce eat any Dinner and spent almost his whole Time in watching Opportunities of conveying Signs of his Approbation by Winks and Nods to his Sister who was not at first altogether so pleased with what she saw as was her Brother  In short  Sophia  so greatly overacted her Part that her Aunt was at first staggered and began to suspect some Affectation in her Niece but as she was herself a Woman of Great Art so she soon attributed this to extreme Art in  Sophia  She remembered the many Hints she had given her Neice concerning her being in Love and imagined the young Lady had taken this Way to rally her out of her Opinion by an overacted Civility a Notion that was corroborated by the excessive Gaiety with which the whole was accompanied We cannot here avoid remarking that this Conjecture would have been better founded had  Sophia  lived ten Years in the Air of  Grosvenor square  where young Ladies do learn a wonderful Knack of rallying and playing with that Passion which is a mighty serious Thing in the Woods and Groves a hundred Miles Distant from  London  To say the Truth in discovering the Deceit of others it matters much that our own Art be wound up if I may use the Expression in the same Key with theirs For very artful Men sometimes miscarry by fancying others wiser or in other Words greater Knaves than they really are As this Observation is pretty deep I will illustrate it by the following short Story Three Countrymen were pursuing a  Wiltshire  Thief through  Brentford  The simplest of them seeing the  Wiltshire House  written under a Sign advised his Companions to enter it for there  most probably they would find their Countryman The second who was wiser laughed at this Simplicity but the third who was wiser still answered 'Let us go in however for he may think we should not suspect him of going amongst his own Countrymen' They accordingly went in and searched the House and by that Means missed overtaking the Thief who was at that Time but a little ways before them and who as they all knew but had never once reflected could not read  The Reader will pardon a Digression in which so invaluable a Secret is communicated since every Gamester will agree how necessary it is to know exactly the Play of another in order to countermine him This will moreover afford a Reason why the wiser Man as is often seen is the Bubble of the weaker and why many simple and innocent Characters are so generally misunderstood and misrepresented but what is most material this will account for the Deceit which  Sophia  put on her politic Aunt  Dinner being ended and the Company retired into the Garden Mr  Western  who was thoroughly convinced of the certainty of what his Sister had told him took Mr  Allworthy  aside and very bluntly proposed a Match between  Sophia  and young Mr  Blifil  Mr  Allworthy  was not one of those Men whose Hearts flutter at any unexpected and sudden Tidings of worldly profit His Mind was indeed tempered with that Philosophy which becomes a Man and a Christian He affected no absolute Superiority to all Pleasure and Pain to all Joy and Grief but was not at the same time to be discomposed and ruffled by every accidental Blast by every Smile or Frown of Fortune He received therefore Mr  Western'  s Proposal without any visible Emotion or without any Alteration of Countenance He said the Alliance was such as he sincerely wished then launched forth  into a very just Encomium on the young Lady's Merit acknowledged the Offer to be advantageous in Point of Fortune and after thanking Mr  Western  for the good Opinion he had profess'd of his Nephew concluded that if the young People liked each other he should be very desirous to complete the Affair  Western  was a little disappointed at Mr  Allworthy'  s Answer which was not so warm as he expected He treated the Doubt whether the young People might like one another with great Contempt saying 'That Parents were the best Judges of proper Matches for their Children that for his Part he should insist on the most resigned Obedience from his Daughter and if any young Fellow could refuse such a Bedfellow he was his humble Servant and hoped there was no Harm done'  Allworthy  endeavoured to soften this Resentment by many  Elogium'  s on  Sophia  declaring he had no doubt but that Mr  Blifil  would very gladly receive the Offer but all was ineffectual he could obtain no other Answer from the Squire but'I say no moreI humbly Hope there's no Harm donethat's all' Which Words he repeated at least a hundred Times before they parted  Allworthy  was too well acquainted with his Neighbour to be offended at this Behaviour and tho' he was so averse to the Rigour which some Parents exercise on their Children in the Article of Marriage that he had resolved never to force his Nephew's Inclinations he was nevertheless much pleased with the prospect of this Union For the whole Country resounded the praises of  Sophia  and he had himself greatly admired the uncommon Endowments of both her Mind and Person To which I believe we may add the Consideration of her vast Fortune which tho' he was too sober to be intoxicated with he was too sensible to despise  And here in Defiance of all the barking Critics in the World I must and will introduce a Digression concerning true Wisdom of which Mr  Allworthy  was in Reality as great a Pattern as he was of Goodness  True Wisdom then notwithstanding all which Mr  Hogarth'  s poor Poet may have writ against Riches and in Spite of all which any rich wellfed Divine may have preached against Pleasure consists not in the contempt of either of these A Man may have as much Wisdom in the Possession of an affluent Fortune as any Beggar in the Streets or may enjoy a handsome Wife or a hearty Friend and still remain as wise as any sour Popish Recluse who buries all his social Faculties and starves his Belly while he well lashes his Back  To say Truth the wisest Man is the likeliest to possess all worldly Blessings in an eminent Degree For as that Moderation which Wisdom prescribes is the surest Way to useful Wealth so can it alone qualify us to taste many Pleasures The wise Man gratifies every Appetite and every Passion while the Fool sacrifices all the rest to pall and satiate one  It may be objected that very wise Men have been notoriously avaricious I answer not in that Instance It may likewise be said that the wisest Men have been in their Youth immoderately fond of Pleasure I answer they were not wise then  Wisdom in short whose Lessons have been represented as so hard to learn by those who never were at her School teaches us only to extend a simple Maxim universally known and followed even in the lowest Life a little farther than that Life carries it And this is not to buy at too dear a Price  Now whoever takes this Maxim abroad with him into the grand Market of the World and constantly applies it to Honours to Riches to pleasures and to every other Commodity which that Market affords is I will venture to affirm a wise Man and  must be so acknowledged in the worldly Sense of the Word For he makes the best of Bargains since in Reality he purchases every Thing at the Price only of a little Trouble and carries home all the good Things I have mentioned while he keeps his Health his Innocence and his Reputation the common Prices which are paid for them by others entire and to himself  From this Moderation likewise he learns two other Lessons which complete his Character First never to be intoxicated when he hath made the best Bargain nor dejected when the Market is empty or when its Commodities are too dear for his Purchase  But I must remember on what Subject I am writing and not trespass too far on the Patience of a goodnatured Critic Here therefore I put an End to the Chapter  CHAP IV  Containing sundry curious Matters  AS soon as Mr  Allworthy  returned home he took Mr  Blifil  apart and after some Preface communicated to him the Proposal which had been made by Mr  Western  and at the same Time informed him how agreeable this Match would be to himself  The Charms of  Sophia  had not made the least Impression on  Blifil  not that his Heart was preengaged neither was he totally insensible of Beauty or had any Aversion to Women but his Appetites were by Nature so moderate that he was easily able by Philosophy or by Study or by some other Method to subdue them and as to that Passion which we have treated of in the first Chapter of this Book he had not the least Tincture of it in his whole Composition  But tho' he was so entirely free from that mixed Passion of which we there treated and of which the Virtues and Beauty of  Sophia  formed so notable an Object yet was he altogether as well furnished with some other Passions that promised themselves very full gratification in the young Lady's Fortune Such were Avarice and Ambition which divided the Dominion of his Mind between them He had more than once considered the Possession of this Fortune as a very desirable Thing and had entertained some distant Views concerning it But his own Youth and that of the young Lady and indeed principally a Reflection that Mr  Western  might marry again and have more Children had restrained him from too hasty or eager a Pursuit  This last and most material Objection was now in great Measure removed as the Proposal came from Mr  Western  himself  Blifil  therefore after a very short Hesitation answered Mr  Allworthy  that Matrimony was a Subject on which he had not yet thought But that he was so sensible of his friendly and fatherly Care that he should in all Things submit himself to his Pleasure  Allworthy  was naturally a Man of Spirit and his present Gravity arose from true Wisdom and Philosophy not from any original Phlegm in his Disposition For he had possessed much Fire in his Youth and had married a beautiful Woman for Love He was not therefore greatly pleased with this cold Answer of his Nephew nor could he help launching forth into the Praises of  Sophia  and expressing some Wonder that the Heart of a young Man could be impregnable to the force of such Charms unless it was guarded by some prior Affection  Blifil  assured him he had no such Guard and then proceeded to discourse so wisely and religiously on Love and Marriage that he would have stopt the Mouth of a Parent much less devoutly inclined than  was his Uncle In the End the good Man was satisfied that his Nephew far from having any Objections to  Sophia  had that Esteem for her which in sober and virtuous Minds is the sure Foundation of Friendship and Love And as he doubted not but the Lover would in a little Time become altogether as agreeable to his Mistress he foresaw great Happiness arising to all Parties by so proper and desirable a Union With Mr  Blifil'  s Consent therefore he wrote the next Morning to Mr  Western  acquainting him that his Nephew had very thankfully and gladly received the Proposal and would be ready to wait on the young Lady whenever she should be pleased to accept his Visit  Western  was much pleased with this Letter and immediately returned an Answer in which without having mentioned a Word to his Daughter he appointed that very Afternoon for opening the Scene of Courtship  As soon as he had dispatched this Messenger he went in Quest of his Sister whom he found reading and expounding the Gazette to Parson  Supple  To this Exposition he was obliged to attend near a Quarter of an Hour tho' with great Violence to his natural Impetuosity before he was suffered to speak At length however he found an Opportunity of acquainting the Lady that he had Business of great Consequence to impart to her to which she answered 'Brother I am entirely at your Service Things look so well in the North that I was never in a better Humour'  The Parson then withdrawing  Western  acquainted her with all which had passed and desired her to communicate the Affair to  Sophia  which she readily and chearfully undertook tho' perhaps her Brother was a little obliged to that agreeable Northern Aspect which had so delighted her that he heard no Comment  on his Proceedings for they were certainly somewhat too hasty and violent  CHAP V  In which is related what passed between  Sophia  and her Aunt  SOPHIA  was in her Chamber reading when her Aunt came in The Moment she saw Mrs  Western  she shut the Book with so much Eagerness that the good Lady could not forbear asking her What Book that was which she seemed so much afraid of shewing 'Upon my Word Madam' answered  Sophia  'it is a Book which I am neither ashamed nor afraid to own I have read It is the Production of a young Lady of Fashion whose good Understanding I think doth Honour to her Sex and whose good Heart is an Honour to Human Nature' Mrs  Western  then took up the Book and immediately after threw it down saying'Yes the Author is of a very good Family but she is not much among People one knows I have never read it for the best Judges say there is not much in it'' I dare not Madam set up my own Opinion says  Sophia  'against the best Judges but there appears to me a great deal of human Nature it and in many Parts so much true Tenderness and Delicacy that it hath cost me many a Tear' 'Ay and do you love to cry then' says the Aunt 'I love a tender Sensation' answered the Niece and would pay the Price of a Tear for it at any Time' Well but shew me' said the Aunt 'what you was reading when I came in there was something very tender in that I believe and very loving too' You blush my dear  Sophia  Ah Child you should read Books which would teach you a little Hypocrisy which would instruct you how to hide your Thoughts a little better' 'I hope Madam' answered  Sophia  'I have no Thoughts which I ought  to be ashamed of discovering' 'Ashamed no' cries the Aunt 'I don't think you have any Thoughts which you ought to be ashamed of and yet Child you blushed just now when I mentioned the Word  Loving  Dear  Sophy  be assured you have not one Thought which I am not well acquainted with as well Child as the  French  are with our Motions long before we put them in Execution Did you think Child because you have been able to impose upon your Father that you could impose upon me Do you imagine I did not know the Reason of your overacting all that Friendship for Mr  Blifil  yesterday I have seen a little too much of the World to be so deceived Nay nay do not blush again I tell you it is a Passion you need not be ashamed ofIt is a Passion I myself approve and have already brought your Father into the Approbation of Indeed I solely consider your Inclination for I would always have that gratified if possible though one may sacrifice higher Prospects Come I have News which will delight your very Soul Make me your Confident and I will undertake you shall be happy to the very Extent of your Wishes' 'La Madam' says  Sophia  looking more foolishly than ever she did in her Life 'I know not what to sayWhy Madam should you suspect''Nay no Dishonesty' returned Mr  Western  'Consider you are speaking to one of your own Sex to an Aunt and I hope you are convinced you speak to a Friend Consider you are only revealing to me what I know already and what I plainly saw yesterday through that most artful of all Disguises which you had put on and which must have deceived any one who had not perfectly known the World Lastly consider it is a Passion which I highly approve' 'La Madam' says  Sophia  'you come upon one so unawares and on a sudden To be sure Madam I am not blindand certainly  if it be a Fault to see all human Perfections assembled togetherBut is it possible my Father and you Madam can see with my Eyes I tell you' answered the Aunt 'we do entirely approve and this very afternoon your Father hath appointed for you to receive your Lover' 'My Father this Afternoon' cries  Sophia  with the Blood starting from her Face'Yes Child' said the Aunt 'this Afternoon You know the Impetuosity of my Brother's Temper I acquainted him with the Passion which I first discovered in you that Evening when you fainted away in the Field I saw it in your Fainting I saw it immediately upon your Recovery I saw it that Evening at Supper and the next Morning at Breakfast you know Child I have seen the World Well I no sooner acquainted my Brother but he immediately wanted to propose it to  Allworthy  He proposed it Yesterday  Allworthy  consented as to be sure he must with Joy and this Afternoon I tell you you are to put on all your best Airs' This Afternoon' cries  Sophia  'Dear Aunt you frighten me out of my Senses' 'O my Dear' said the Aunt 'you will soon come to yourself again for he is a charming young Fellow that's the Truth on't' 'Nay I will own' says  Sophia  I know none with such Perfections So brave and yet so gentle so witty yet so inoffensive so humane so civil so genteel so handsome What signifies his being base born when compared with such Qualifications as these' Base born what do you mean' said the Aunt Mr  Blifil  base born'  Sophia  turned instantly pale  t this Name and faintly repeated it Upon which  he Aunt cried 'Mr  Blifil  ay Mr  Blifil  of whom else have we been talking' 'Good Heaven' an  wered  Sophia  ready to sink 'of Mr  Jones  I thought I am sure I know no other who deserves' 'I protest' cries the Aunt 'you frighten  me in your Turn Is it Mr  Jones  and not Mr  Blifil  who is the Object of your Affection' 'Mr  Blifil'  repeated  Sophia  'Sure it is impossible you can be in earnest if you are I am the most miserable Woman alive' Mrs  Western  now stood a few Moments silent while Sparks of fiery Rage flashed from her Eyes At length collecting all her Force of Voice she thundered forth in the following articulate Sounds  'And is it possible you can think of disgracing your Family by allying yourself to a Bastard Can the Blood of the  Westerns  submit to such Contamination If you have not Sense sufficient to restrain such monstrous Inclinations I thought the Pride of our Family would have prevented you from giving' the least Encouragement to so base an Affection 'much less did I imagine you would ever have had the Assurance to own it to my Face'  'Madam' answered  Sophia  trembling 'what I have said you have extorted from me I do not remember to have ever mentioned the Name of Mr  Jones  with Approbation to any one before nor should I now had I not conceived he had had your Approbation Whatever were my Thoughts of that poor unhappy young Man I intended to have carried them with me to my GraveTo that Grave where now I find I am only to seek Repose'Here she sunk down in her Chair drowned in her Tears and in all the moving Silence of unutterable Grief presented a Spectacle which must have affected almost the hardest Heart  All this tender Sorrow however raised no Compassion in her Aunt On the contrary she now fell into the most violent Rage'And I would rather' she cried in a most vehement Voice 'follow you to your Grave than I would see you disgrace yourself and your Family by such a Match O Heavens could I have ever suspected that I should live  to hear a Niece of mine declare a Passion for such a Fellow You are the firstyes Miss  Western  you are the first of your Name who ever entertained so groveling a Thought A Family so noted' for the Prudence of its WomenHere she run on a full Quarter of an Hour till having exhausted her Breath rather than her Rage she concluded with threatening to go immediately and acquaint her Brother  Sophia  then threw herself at her Feet and laying hold of her Hands 'begged her with Tears to conceal what she had drawn from her urging the Violence of her Father's Temper and protesting that no Inclinations of hers should ever prevail with her to do any thing which might offend him'  Mrs  Western  stood a Moment looking at her and then having recollected herself said that 'on one Consideration only she would keep the Secret from her Brother and this was that  Sophia  should promise to entertain Mr  Blifil  that very Afternoon as her Lover and to regard him as the Person who was to be her Husband'  Poor  Sophia  was too much in her Aunt's Power to deny her any thing positively she was obliged to promise that she would see Mr  Blifil  and be as civil to him as possible but begged her Aunt that the Match might not be hurried on She said 'Mr  Blifil  was by no means agreeable to her and she hoped her Father would be prevailed on not to make her the most wretched of Women'  Mrs  Western  assured her 'that the Match was entirely agreed upon and that nothing could or should prevent it' 'I must own' said she 'I looked on it as on a Matter of Indifference nay perhaps had some Scruples about it before which were actually got over by my thinking it highly agreeable to your own Inclinations but now I regard it as the most eligible Thing in the World nor shall there  be if I can prevent it a Moment of Time lost on the Occasion'  Sophia  replied 'Delay at least Madam I may expect from both your Goodness and my Father's Surely you will give me Time to endeavour to get the better of so strong a Disinclination as I have at present to this Person'  The Aunt answered 'She knew too much of the World to be so deceived that as she was sensible another Man had her Affections she would persuade Mr  Western  to hasten the Match as much as possible It would be bad Politics indeed added she to protract a Siege when the Enemy's Army is at Hand and in Danger of relieving it No no  Sophy  said she as I am convinced you have a violent Passion which you can never satisfy with Honour I will do all I can to put your Honour out of the Care of your Family For when you are married those Matters will belong only to the Consideration of your Husband I hope Child you will always have Prudence enough to act as becomes you but if you should not Marriage hath saved many a Woman from Ruin'  Sophia  well understood what her Aunt menat but did not think proper to make her an Answer However she took a Resolution to see Mr  Blifil  and to behave to him as civilly as she could For on that Condition only she obtained a Promise from her Aunt to keep secret the Liking which her ill Fortune rather than any Scheme of Mrs  Western  had unhappily drawn from her  CHAP VI  Containing a Dialogue between  Sophia  and Mrs  Honour  which may a little relieve those tender Affections which the foregoing Scene may have raised in the Mind of a goodnatur'd Reader  MRS  Western  having obtained that Promise from her Niece which we have seen in the last Chapter  withdrew and presently after arrived Mrs  Honour  She was at Work in a neighbouring Apartment and had been summoned to the Keyhole by some Vociferation in the preceding Dialogue where she had continued during the remaining Part of it At her Entry into the Room she found  Sophia  standing motionless with the Tears trickling from her Eyes Upon which she immediately ordered a proper Quantity of Tears into her own Eyes and then began 'O Gemini my dear Lady what is the Matter Nothing' cries  Sophia  'Nothing dear Madam' answers Mrs  Honour  'you must not tell me that when your Ladyship is in this Taking and when there hath been such a  Preamble  between your Ladyship and Madam  Western'  'Don't teaze me' cries  Sophia  'I tell you nothing is the MatterGood Heavens Why was I bornNay Madam' says Mrs  Honour  'you shall never persuade me that your La'ship can lament yourself so for nothing To be sure I am but a Servant but to be sure I have been always faithful to your Ladyship and to be sure I would serve your La'ship with my Life' 'My dear  Honour'  says  Sophia  'tis not in thy Power to be of any Service to me I am irretrievably undone' 'Heaven forbid' answered the Waiting woman 'but if I can't be of any Service to you pray tell me Madam it will be some Comfort to me to know Pray dear Ma'am tell me what's the Matter' 'My Father' cries  Sophia  'is going to marry me to a Man I both despise and hate' O dear Ma'am' answered the other 'Who is this wicked Man for to be sure he is very bad or your La'ship would not despise him' 'His Name is Poison to my Tongue replied  Sophia'  'thou wilt know it too soon' Indeed to confess the Truth she knew it already and therefore was not very inquisitive as to that Point She then proceeded thus 'I don't pretend to give  your La'ship Advice  whereof  your La'ship knows much better than I can pretend to being but a Servant but ifackins no Father in  England  should marry me against my Consent And to be sure the Squire is so good that if he did but know your La'ship despises and hates the young Man to be sure he would not desire you to marry him And if your La'ship would but give me Leave to tell my Master soTo be sure it would be more properer to come from your own Mouth but as your La'ship doth not care to foul your Tongue with his nasty Name' 'You are mistaken  Honour'  says  Sophia  'my Father was determined before he ever thought fit to mention it to me' 'More Shame for him' cries  Honour  'you are to go to Bed to him and not Master And thof a Man may be a very proper Man yet every Woman mayn't think him handsome alike I am sure my Master would never act in this Manner of his own Head I wish some People would trouble themselves only with what belongs to them they would not I believe like to be served so if it was their own Case For tho' I am a Maid I can easily believe as how all Men are not equally agreeable And what signifies your La'ship having so great a Fortune if you can't please yourself with the Man you think most handsomest Well I say nothing but to be sure it is Pity some Folks had not been better born nay as for that Matter I should not mind it my self But then there is not so much Money and what of that your La'ship hath Money enough for both and where can your La'ship bestow your Fortune better For to be sure every one must allow that he is the most handsomest charmingest finest tallest properest Man in the World' 'What do you mean by running on in this Manner to me' cries  Sophia  with a very grave Countenance 'Have I ever given any Encouragement for these Liberties Nay  Ma'am I ask Pardon I meant no Harm' answered she 'but to be sure the poor Gentleman hath run in my Head ever since I saw him this MorningTo be sure if your Ladyship had but seen him just now you must have pitied him Poor Gentleman I wishes some Misfortune hath not happened to him For he hath been walking about with his Arms across and looking so melancholy all this Morning I vow and protest it made me almost cry to see him' 'To see whom says  Sophia  'Poor Mr  Jones'  answered  Honour  'See him Why where did you see him' cries  Sophia  'By the Canal Ma'am' says  Honour  'There he hath been walking all this Morning and at last there he laid himself down I believe he lies there still To be sure if it had not been for my Modesty being a Maid as I am I should have gone and spoke to him Do Ma'am let me go and see only for a Fancy whether he is there still'' 'Pugh' says  Sophia  'There no no what should he do there He is gone before this Time to be sure Besides whywhatwhy should you go to seeBesides I want you for something else Go fetch me my Hat and Gloves I shall walk with my Aunt in the Grove before Dinner'  Honour  did immediately as she was bid and  Sophia  put her Hat on when looking in the Glass she fancied the Ribbon with which her Hat was tied did not become her and so sent her Maid back again for a Ribbon of a different Colour and then giving Mrs  Honour  repeated Charges not to leave her Work on any Account as she said it was in violent Haste and must be finished that very Day she muttered something more about going to the Grove and then sallied out the contrary Way and walked as fast as her tender trembling Limbs could carry her directly towards the Canal  Jones  had been there as Mrs  Honour  had told her He had indeed spent two Hours there that Morning  in melancholy Contemplation on his  Sophia  and had gone out from the Garden at one Door the Moment she entered it at another So that those unlucky Minutes which had been spent in changing the Ribbons had prevented the Lovers from Meeting at this Time A most unfortunate Accident from which my fair Readers will not fail to draw a very wholesome Lesson And here I strictly forbid all Maie Critics to intermeddle with a Circumstance which I have recounted only for the Sake of the Ladies and upon whichthey only are at Liberty to comment  CHAP VII  A Picture of formal Courtship in Miniature as it always ought to be drawn and a Scene of a tenderer Kind painted at full Length  IT was well remarked by one and perhaps by more that Misfortunes do not come single This wise Maxim was now verified by  Sophia  who was not only disappointed of seeing the Man she loved but had the Vexation of being obliged to dress herself out in order to receive a Visit from the Man she hated  That Afternoon Mr  Western  for the first Time acquainted his Daughter with his Intention telling her he knew very well that she had heard it before from her Aunt  Sophia  looked very grave upon this nor could she prevent a few Pearls from stealing into her Eyes 'Come come' says  Western  'none of your Maidenish Airs I know all I assure you' Sister hath told me all'  'Is it possible' says  Sophia  'that my Aunt can have betrayed me already' 'Ay ay' says  Western  betrayed you ay Why you betrayed yourself yesterday at Dinner You shewed your Fancy very plainly I think But you young Girls never know what you would be at So you cry because I am going to marry you to the Man you are in  Love with Your Mother I remember whimpered and whined just in the same Manner but it was all over within twentyfour Hours after we were married Mr  Blifil  is a brisk young Man and will soon put an End to your Squeamishness Come chear up chear up I expect un every Minute'  Sophia  was now convinced that her Aunt had behaved honourably to her and she determined to go through that disagreeable Afternoon with as much Resolution as possible and without giving the least Suspicion in the World to her Father  Mr  Blifil  soon arrived and Mr  Western  soon after withdrawing left the young Couple together  Here a long Silence of near a Quarter of an Hour ensued For the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation had all that unbecoming Modesty which consists in Bashfulness He often attempted to speak and as often suppressed his Words just at the very Point of Utterance At last out they broke in a Torrent of farfetched and highstrained Compliments which were answered on her Side by downcast Looks half Bows and civil Monosyllables  Blifil  from his Inexperience in the Ways of Women and from his Conceit of himself took this Behaviour for a modest Assent to his Courtship and when to shorten a Scene which she could no longer support  Sophia  rose up and left the Room he imputed that too merely to Bashfulness and comforted himself that he should have enough of her Company  He was indeed perfectly well satisfied with his prospect of Success For as to that entire and absolute Possession of the Heart of his Mistress which romantic Lovers require the very Idea of it never entered his Head Her Fortune and Person were the sole Object of his Wishes of which he made no Doubt soon to obtain the absolute Property as Mr  Western'  s Mind was so earnestly bent on the Match  and as he well knew the strict Obedience which  Sophia  was always ready to pay to her Father's Will and the greater still which her Father would exact if there was Occasion This Authority therefore together with the Charms which he fancied in his own Person and Conversation could not fail he thought of succeeding with a young Lady whose Inclinations were he doubted not entirely disengaged  Of  Jones  he certainly had not even the least Jealousy and I have often thought it wonderful that he had not Perhaps he imagined the Character which  Jones  bore all over the Country how justly let the Reader determine of being one of the wildest Fellows in  England  might render him odious to a Lady of the most exemplary Modesty Perhaps his Suspicions might be laid asleep by the Behaviour of  Sophia  and of  Jones  himself when they were all in Company together Lastly and indeed principally he was well assured there was not another Self in the Case He fancied that he knew  Jones  at the Bottom and had in Reality a great Contempt for his Understanding for not being more attached to his own Interest He had no Apprehension that  Jones  was in Love with  Sophia  and as for any lucrative Motives he imagined they would sway very little with so silly a Fellow  Blifil  moreover thought the Affair of  Molly Seagrim  still went on and indeed believed it would end in Marriage For  Jones  really loved him from his Childhood and kept no Secret from him till his Behaviour on the Sickness of Mr  Allworthy  had entirely alienated his Heart and it was by means of the Quarrel which had ensued on this Occasion and which was not yet reconciled that Mr  Blifil  knew nothing of the Alteration which had happened in the Affection which  Jones  had formerly bore towards  Molly  From these Reasons therefore Mr  Blifil  saw no Far to his Success with  Sophia  He concluded her  Behaviour was like that of all other young Ladies on  first visit from a Lover and it had indeed entirely answered his Expectations  Mr  Western  took Care to waylay the Lover at his Exit from his Mistress He found himself so elevated with his Success so enamoured with his Daughter and so satisfied with her Reception of him that the old Gentleman began to caper and dance about his Hall and by many other antic Actions to express the Extravagance of his Joy For he had not the least Command over any of his Passions and that which had at any Time the Ascendant in his Mind hurried him to the wildest Excesses  As soon as  Blifil  was departed which was not till after many hearty Kisses and embraces bestowed on him by  Western  the good Squire went in Quest of his Daughter whom he no sooner found than he poured forth the most Extravagant Raptures bidding her chuse what Clothes and Jewels she pleased and declaring that he had no other Use for Fortune but to make her happy He then caressed her again and again with the utmost Profusion of Fondness called her by the most endearing Names and protested she was his only Joy on Earth  Sophia  perceiving her Father in this Fit of Affection which she did not absolutely know the Reason of for Fits of Fondness were not unusual to him tho' this was rather more violent than ordinary thought she should never have a better Opportunity of disclosing herself than at present as far at least as regarded Mr  Blifil  and she too well foresaw the Necessity which she should soon be under of coming to a full Explanation After having thanked the Squire therefore for all his Professions of Kindness she added with a Look full of inexpressible Softness 'And is it possible my Papa can be so good to place all his Joy in his  Sophy'  s Happiness' which  Western  having confirmed by a great Oath and a Kiss she then laid hold of his Hand and falling on her Knees after many warm and passionate Declarations of Affection and Duty she begged him 'not to make her the most miserable Creature on Earth by forcing her to marry a Man whom she detested This I entreat of you dear Sir' said she 'for your Sake as well as my own since you are so very kind to tell me your Happiness depends on mine' How what' says  Western  staring wildly' 'O Sir' continued she 'not only your poor  Sophy'  s Happiness her very Life her Being depends upon your granting her Request I cannot live with Mr  Blifil  To force me into this Marriage would be killing me' 'You can't live with Mr  Blifil'  says  Western  'No upon my Soul I can't answered  Sophia  Then die and be dned' cries he spurning her from him 'Oh Sir' cries  Sophia  catching hold of the Skirt of his Coat 'take Pity on me I beseech you Don't look and say such cruelCan you be unmoved while you see your  Sophy  in this dreadful Condition Can the best of Father's break my Heart Will he kill me by the most painful cruel lingering Death' Pooh Pooh' cries the Squire all Stuff and Nonsense all Maidenish Tricks Kill you indeed Will Marriage kill you''Oh Sir' answered  Sophia  such a Marriage is worse than DeathHe is not even indifferent I hate and detest himIf you detest un never so much' cries  Western  'you shall ha'un' This he bound by an Oath too shocking to repeat and after many violent Asseverations concluded in these Words 'I am resolved upon the Match and unless you consent to it I will not give you a Groat not a single Farthing no tho' I saw you expiring with Famine in the Street I would not relieve you with a Morsel of Bread This is my fixed Resolution and so I leave you to  consider on it' He then broke from her with such Violence that her Face dashed against the Floor and he burst directly out of the Room leaving poor  Sophia  prostrate on the Ground  When  Western  came into the Hall he there found  Jones  who seeing his Friend looking wild and pale and almost Breathless could not forbear enquiring the Reason of all these melacholy Appearances Upon which the Squire immediately acquainted him with the whole Matter concluding with bitter denunciations against  Sophia  and very pathetic Lamentations of the Misery of all Fathers who are so unfortunate to have Daughters  Jones  to whom all the Resolutions which had been taken in Favour of  Blifil  were yet a Secret was almost struck dead with this Relation but recovering his Spirits a little mere Despair as he afterwards said inspired him to mention a Matter to Mr  Western  which seemed to require more impudence than a human Forehead was ever gifted with He desired Leave to go to  Sophia  that he might endeavour to obtain her Concurrence with her Father's Inclinations  If the Squire had been as quicksighted as he was remarkable for the contrary Passion might at present very well have blinded him He thanked  Jones  for offering to undertake the Office and said  'Go go  prithee try what can'st do' and then swore many execrable Oaths that he would turn her out of Doors unless she consented to the Match  CHAP VIII  The Meeting between  Jones  and  Sophia  JONES  departed instantly in Quest of  Sophia  whom he found just risen from the Ground where her Father had left her with the Tears trickling from her Eyes and her Blood running from her Lips  He presently ran to her and with a Voice full at once of Tenderness and Terrour cried 'O my  Sophia  what means this dreadful Sight'She looked softly at him for a Moment before she spoke and then said 'Mr  Jones  for Heaven's Sake how came you hereLeave me I beseech you this Moment' 'Do not' says he 'impose so harsh a Command upon memy Heart bleeds faster than those Lips O  Sophia  how easily could I drain my Veins to preserve one Drop of that dear Blood' 'I have too many Obligations to you already' answered she 'for sure' you meant them suchHere she looked at him tenderly almost a Minute and then bursting into an an Agony cried'O Mr  Jones  why did you save my Lifemy Death would have been happier for us both'Happier for us both' cried he Could Racks or Wheels kill me so painfully as  Sophia'  sI cannot bear the dreadful SoundDo I live but for her'Both his Voice and look were full of inexpressible Tenderness when he spoke these Words and at the same Time he laid gently hold on her Hand which she did not withdraw from him to say the Truth she hardly knew what she did or suffered A few Moments now passed in Silence between those Lovers while his Eyes were eagerly fixed on  Sophia  and hers declining towards the Ground and at last she recovered Strength enough to desire him again to leave her for that her certain Ruin would be the Consequence of their being found together adding'O Mr  Jones  you know not you know not what passed this cruel Afternoon' I know all my  Sophia'  answered he your cruel Father has told me all and he himself hath sent me hither to you' My Father sent you to me' replied she 'sure you dream' Would to Heaven' cries he 'it was but a Dream O  Sophia  your Father hath sent me to you to be  an Advocate for my odious Rival to solicite you in his FavourI took any Means to get Access to youO speak to me  Sophia  comfort my bleeding Heart Sure no one ever loved ever doated like me Do not unkindly withhold this dear this soft this gentle HandOne Moment perhaps tears you for ever from meNothing less than this cruel Occasion could I believe have ever conquered the Respect and Awe with which you have inspired me' She stood a Moment silent and covered with Confusion then lifting up her Eyes gently towards him she cried 'What would Mr  Jones  have me say' 'O do but promise' cries he that you never will give yourself to  Blifil'  'Name not' answered she 'the detested Sound Be assured I never will give him what it is in my Power to withhold from him' 'Now then' cries he 'while you are so perfectly kind go a little farther and add that I may hope''Alass' says she 'Mr  Jones  whither will you drive me What Hope have I to bestow You know my Father's Intentions''But I know' answered he 'your Compliance with them cannot be compelled' What' says she 'must be the dreadful Consequence of my Disobedience My own Ruin is my least Concern I cannot bear the Thoughts of being the Cause of my Father's Misery' He is himself the Cause' cries  Jones  'by exacting a Power over you which Nature hath not given him Think on the Misery I am to suffer if I am to lose you and see on which Side Pity will turn the Ballance' 'Think of it' replied she 'can you imagine I do not feel the Ruin which I must bring on you should I comply with your DesireIt is that Thought which gives me Resolution to bid you fly from me for ever and avoid your own Destruction' I fear no Destruction' cries he 'but the Loss of  Sophia  if you would save me from the  most bitter Agonies recall that cruel SentenceIndeed I can never part with you indeed I cannot'  The Lovers stood both silent and trembling  Sophia  being unable to withdraw her Hand from  Jones  and he almost as unable to hold it when the Scene which I believe some of my Readers will think had lasted long enough was interrupted by one of so different a Nature that we shall reserve the Relation of it for a different Chrpter  CHAP IX  Being of a much more tempestuous Kind than the former  BEFORE we proceed with what happened to our Lovers it may be proper to recount what had past in the Hall during their tender Interview  Soon after  Jones  had left Mr  Western  in the Manner abovementioned his Sister came to him and was presently informed of all that had past between her Brother and  Sophia  relating to  Blifil  This Behaviour in her Neice the good Lady construed to an absolute Breach of the Condition on which she had engaged to keep her Love for Mr  Jones  a Secret She considered herself therefore at full Liberty to reveal all she knew to the Squire which she did immediately in the most explicite Terms and without any Ceremony or Preface  The Idea of a Marriage between  Jones  and his Daughter had never once entered into the Squire's Head either in the warmest Minutes of his Affection towards that young Man or from Suspicion or on any other Occasion He did indeed consider a Parity of Fortune and Circumstances to be physically as necessary an Ingredient in Marriage as Difference of Sexes or any other Essential and had no more Apprehension of his Daughter's falling in Love with a  poor Man than with any Animal of a different Species  He became therefore like one Thunderstruck at his Sister's Relation He was at first incapable of making any Answer having been almost deprived of his Breath by the Violence of the Surprize This however soon returned and as is usual in other Cases after an Intermission with redoubled Force and Fury  The first Use he made of the Power of Speech after his Recovery from the sudden Effects of his Astonishment was to discharge a round Volley of Oaths and Imprecations After which he proceeded hastily to the Apartment where he expected to find the Lovers and murmured or indeed rather roared forth Intentions of Revenge every Step he went  As when two Doves or two Woodpigeons or as when  Strephon  and  Phillis  for that comes nearest to the Mark are retired into some pleasant solitary Grove to enjoy the delightful Conversation of Love that bashful Boy who cannot speak in public and is never a good Companion to more than two at a Time Here while every Object is serene should a hoarse Thunder burst suddenly through the shattered Clouds and rumbling roll along the Sky the frightened Maid starts from the mossy Bank or verdant Turf the pale Livery of Death succeeds the red Regimentals in which Love had before drest her Cheeks Fear shakes her whole Frame and her Lover scarce supports her trembling tottering Limbs  Or as when two Gentlemen Strangers to the wonderous Wit of the Place are cracking a Bottle together at some Inn or Tavern at  Salisbury  if the great  Dowdy  who acts the Part of a Madman as well as some of his Setterson do that of a Fool should rattle his Chains and dreadfully hum forth the grumbling Catch along the Gallery the frighted Strangers stand aghast scared at the horrid Sound they seek  some Place of Shelter from the approaching Danger and if the wellbarred Windows did admit their Exit would venture their Necks to escape the threatning Fury now coming upon them  So trembled poor  Sophia  so turned she pale at the Noise of her Father who in a Voice most dreadful to hear came on swearing cursing and vowing the Destruction of  Jones  To say the Truth I believe the Youth himself would from some prudent Considerations have preferred another Place of Abode at this Time had his Terrour on  Sophia'  s Account given him Liberty to reflect a Moment on what any otherways concerned himself than as his Love made him partake whatever affected her  And now the Squire having burst open the Door beheld an Object which instantly suspended all his Fury against  Jones  this was the ghastly Appearance of  Sophia  who had fainted away in her Lover's Arms This tragical Sight Mr  Western  no sooner beheld than all his Rage forsook him he roared for Help with his utmost Violence ran first to his Daughter then back to the Door calling for Water and then back again to  Sophia  never considering in whose Arms she then was nor perhaps once recollecting that there was such a Person in the World as  Jones  For indeed I believe the present Circumstances of his Daughter were now the sole consideration which employed his Thoughts  Mrs  Western  and a great Number of Servants soon came to the Assistance of  Sophia  with Water Cordials and every Thing necessary on those Occasions These were applied with such Success that  Sophia  in a very few Minutes began to recover and all the Symptoms of Life to return Upon which she was presently led off by her own Maid and Mrs  Western  nor did that good Lady depart without leaving some wholesome Admonitions with her Brother on the  dreadful Effects of his Passion or as she pleased to call it Madness  The Squire perhaps did not understand this goo Advice as it was delivered in obscure Hints Shrugs and Notes of Admiration at least if he did understand it he profited very little by it For no sooner was he cured of his immediate Fears for his Daughter than he relapsed into his former Frenzy which must have produced an immediate Battle with  Jones  had not Parson  Supple  who was a very strong Man been present and by mere Force restrained the Squire from Acts of Hostility  The Moment  Sophia  was departed  Jones  advanced in a very suppliant Manner to Mr  Western  whom the Parson held in his Arms and begged him to be pacify'd for that while he continued in such a Passion it would be impossible to give him any Satisfaction  'I wull have satisfaction o' thee' answered the Squire 'so doff thy Clothes  At unt  half a Man 'and I'll lick thee as well as wast ever licked in thy Life' Hethen bespattered the Youth with Abundance of that Language which passes between Country Gentlemen who embrace opposite Sides of the Question with frequent Applications to him to salute that Part which is generally introduced into all Controversies that arise among the lower Orders of the  English  Gentry at Horseraces Cockmatches and other public Places Allusions to this Part are likewise often made for the Sake of the Jest And here I believe the Wit is generally misunderstood In Reality it lies in desiring another to kiss your Afor having just before threatened to kick his For I have observed very accurately that no one ever desires you to kick that which belongs to himself nor offers to kiss this Part in another  It may likewise seem surprizing that in the many thousand kind Invitations of this Sort which every  one who hath conversed with Country Gentlemen must have heard no one I believe hath ever seen a single Instance where the Desire hath been complied with A great Instance of their Want of Politeness For in Town nothing can be more common than for the finest Gentlemen to perform this Ceremony every Day to their Superiors without having that Favour once requested of them  To all such Wit  Jones  very calmly answered 'Sir this Usage may perhaps cancel every other Obligation you have conferred on me but there is one you can never cancel nor will I be provoked by your Abuse to lift my Hand against the Father of  Sophia  '  At these Words the Squire grew still more outrageous than before so that the Parson begged  Jones  to retire saying 'You behold Sir how he waxeth Wroth at your abode here therefore let me pray you not to tarry any longer His Anger is too much kindled for you to commune with him at present You had better therefore conclude your Visit and refer what Matter you have to urge in your Behalf to some other Opportunity'  Jones  accepted this Advice with Thanks and immediately departed The Squire now regained the Liberty of his Hands and so much Temper as to express some Satisfaction in the Restraint which had been laid upon him declaring that he should certainly have beat his Brains out and adding 'It would have vexed one confoundedly to have been hanged for such a Rascal'  The Parson now began to triumph in the Success of his Peacemaking Endeavours and proceeded to read a Lecture against Anger which might perhaps rather have tended to raise than to quiet that Passion in some hasty Minds This Lecture he enriched with many valuable Quotations from the Antients particularly from  Seneca  who hath indeed so well  handled this Passion that none but a very angry Man can read him without great Pleasure and Profit The Doctor concluded his Harangue with the famous Story of  Alexander  and  Clytus  but as I find that entered in my CommonPlace under Title Drunkenness I shall not insert it here  The Squire took no Notice of this Story nor perhaps of any Thing he said For he interrupted him before he had finished by calling for a Tankard of Beer observing which is perhaps as true as any Observation on this Fever of the Mind  that Anger makes a Man dry  No sooner had the Squire swallowed a large Draught than he renewed the Discourse on  Jones  and declared a Resolution of going the next Morning early to acquaint Mr  Allworthy  His Friend would have dissuaded him from this from the mere Motive of Goodnature but his Dissuasion had no other Effect than to produce a large Volley of Oaths and Curses which greatly shocked the pious Ears of  Supple  but he did not dare to remonstrate against a Privilege which the Squire claimed as a freeborn  Englishman  To say Truth the Parson submitted to please his Palate at the Squire's Table at the Expence of suffering this Violence now and then to his Ears He contented himself with thinking he did not promote this evil Practice and that the Squire would not swear an Oath the less if he never entered within his Gates However tho' he was not guilty of ill Manners by rebuking a Gentleman in his own House he paid him off obliquely in the Pulpit which had not indeed the good Effect of working a Reformation in the Squire himself yet it so far operated on his Conscience that he put the Laws very severely in Execution against others and the Magistrate was the only Person in the Parish who could swear with Impunity  CHAP X  In which Mr  Western  visits Mr  Allworthy  MR  Allworthy  was now retired from Breakfast with his Nephew well satisfied with the Report of the young Gentleman's successful Visit to  Sophia  for he greatly desired the Match more on Account of the young Lady's Character than of her Riches when Mr  Western  broke abrubtly in upon them and without any Ceremony began as follows  'There you have done a fine Piece of Work truly You have brought up your Bastard to a fine Purpose not that I believe you have had any Hand in it neither that is as a Man may say designedly but there is a fine Kettle of Fish made o't up at our House' 'What can be the Matter Mr  Western  said  Allworthy  O Matter  enow  of all Conscience my Daughter hath fallen in Love with your Bastard that's all but I won't  ge  her a  Hapenny  not the Twentieth Part of a Brass Farthing I always thought what would come o' breeding up a Bastard like a Gentleman and letting  un  come about to  Volk'  s Houses Its well  vor un  I could not get  at un  I'd  a licked un  I'd a spoil'd his Caterwauling I'd a taught the Son of a Whore to meddle with Meat for his Master He shan't ever have a Morsel of Meat of mine or a Farthing to buy it If she will  ha un  one Smock shall be her Portion I'll sooner  ge  my  Esteate  to the  zinking  Fund that it may be sent to  Hannover  to corrupt our Nation with' I am heartily sorry' cries  Allworthy  'Pox o' your Sorrow' says  Western  'it will do me Abundance of Good when I have lost my only Child my poor  Sophy  that was the Joy of my Heart and all the Hope and Comfort of my Age but I am resolved I will turn her out o' Doors she shall beg and starve and rot in the Streets Not  one  Hapenny  not a  Hapenny  shall she ever  hae  o' mine The Son of a Bitch was always good at finding a Hare sitting an be rotted to'n I little thought what Puss he was looking after but it shall be the worst he ever  vound  in his Life She shall be no better than Carrion the Skin o'er is all he shall  ha  and  zu  you may tell  un'  'I am in Amazement' cries  Alllworthy  'at what you tell me after what passed between my Nephew and the young Lady no longer ago than Yesterday' 'Yes Sir' answered  Western  'it was after what passed between your Nephew and she that the whole Matter came out Mr  Blifil  there was no sooner gone than the Son of a Whore came lurching about the House Little did I think when I used to love him for a Sportsman that he was all the while a poaching after my Daughter' 'Why truly' says  Allworthy  'I could wish you had not given him so many Opportunities with her and you will do me the Justice to acknowledge that I have always been averse to his staying so much at your House tho' I own I had no Suspicion of this Kind' 'Why Zounds' cries  Western  'who could have thought it What the Devil had she to do wi'n He did not come there a courting to her he came a hunting with me' 'But was it possible' says  Allworthy  'that you should never discern any Symptoms of Love between them when you have seen them so often together 'Never in my Life as I hope to be saved' cries  Western  I never so much as see him kiss her in all my Life and so far from courting her he used rather to be more silent when she was in Company than at any other Time And as for the Girl she was always less civil to'n than to any young Man that came to the House As to that Matter I am not more easy to be deceived than another I would not have you think I am Neighbour'  Allworthy  could scarce refrain Laughter at  this but he resolved to do a Violence to himself For he perfectly well knew Mankind and had too much good Breeding and good Nature to offend the Squire in his present Circumstances He then asked  Western  what he would have him do upon this Occasion To which the other answered 'That he would have him keep the Rascal away from his House and that he would go and lock up the Wench For he was resolved to make her marry Mr  Blifil  in Spite of her Teeth' He then shook  Blifil  by the Hand and swore he would have no other Soninlaw Presently after which he took his Leave saying his House was in such Disorder that it was necessary for him to make Haste home to take care his Daughter did not give him the Slip and as for  Jones  he swore if he caught him at his House he would qualify him to run for the Gelding's Plate  When  Allworthy  and  Blifil  were again left together a long Silence ensued between them all which Interval the young Gentleman filled up with Sighs which proceeded partly from Disappointment but more from Hatred For the Success of  Jones  was much more grievous to him than the Loss of  Sophia  At length his Uncle asked him what he was determined to do and he answered in the following Words 'Alas Sir can it be a Question what Step a Lover will take when Reason and Passion point different Ways I am afraid it is too certain he will in that Dilemma always follow the latter Reason dictates to me to quit all Thoughts of a Woman who places her Affections on another my Passion bids me hope she may in Time change her Inclinations in my Favour Here however I conceive an Objection may be raised which if it could not fully be answered would totally deter me from any further Pursuit I mean the Injustice of endeavouring to supplant another in a Heart of which he seems already in Possession but the determined Resolution  of Mr  Western  shews that in this Case I shall by so doing promote the Happiness of every Party not only that of the Parent who will thus be preserved from the highest Degree of Misery but of both the others who must be undone by this Match The Lady I am sure will be undone in every Sense For besides the Loss of most Part of her own Fortune she will be married not only to a Beggar but the little Fortune which her Father cannot withhold from her will be squandered on that Wench with whom I know he yet conversesNay that is a Trifle For I know him to be one of the worst Men in the World For had my dear Uncle known what I have hitherto endeavoured to conceal he must have long since abandoned so profligate a Wretch' 'How' said  Allworthy  'hath he done any Thing worse than I already know Tell me I beseech you' 'No' replied  Blifil  'it is now past and perhaps he may have repented of it' 'I command you on your Duty' said  Allworthy  to tell me what you mean' 'You know Sir' says  Blifil  'I never disobeyed you but I am sorry I mentioned it since it may now look like Revenge whereas I thank Heaven no such Motive ever entered my Heart and if you oblige me to discover it I must be his Petitioner to you for your Forgiveness' 'I will have no Conditions' answered  Allworthy  'I think I have shewn Tenderness enough towards him and more perhaps than you ought to thank me for' 'More indeed I fear than he deserved' cries  Blifil  'for in the very Day of your utmost Danger when myself and all the Family were in Tears he filled the House with Riot and Debauchery He drank and sung and roared and when I gave him a gentle Hint of the Indecency of his Actions he fell into a violent Passion swore many Oaths called me Rascal and struck me' 'How' cries  Allworthy  'did he dare to strike you' 'I am  sure' cries  Blifil  'I have forgiven him that long ago I wish I could so easily forget his Ingratitude to the best of Benefactors and yet even that I hope you will forgive him since he must have certainly been possessed with the Devil For that very Evening as Mr  Thwackum  and myself were taking the Air in the Fields and exulting in the good Symptoms which then first began to discover themselves we unluckily saw him engaged with a Wench in a Manner not fit to be mentioned Mr  Thwackum  with more Boldness than Prudence advanced to rebuke him when I am sorry to say it he fell upon the worthy Man and beat him so outragiously that I wish he may have yet recovered the Bruises Nor was I without my Share of the Effects of his Malice while I endeavoured to protect my Tutor But that I have long forgiven nay I prevailed with Mr  Thwackum  to forgive him too and not to inform you of a Secret which I feared might be fatal to him And now Sir since I have unadvisedly dropped a Hint of this Matter and your Commands have obliged me to discover the whole let me intercede with you for him' 'O Child' said  Allworthy  I know not whether I should blame or applaud your Goodness in concealing such Villany a Moment but where is Mr  Thwackum  Not that I want any Confirmation of what you say but I will examine all the Evidence of this Matter to justify to the World the Example I am resolved to make of such a Monster'  Thwackum  was now sent for and presently appeared He corroborated every Circumstance which the other deposed Nay he produced the Record upon his Breast where the Handwriting of Mr  Jones  remained very legible in black and blue He concluded with declaring to Mr  Allworthy  that he should have long since informed him of this Matter had not Mr  Blifil  by the most earnest Interpositions  prevented him 'He is says he an excellent Youth though such Forgiveness of Enemies is carrying the Matter too far'  In reality  Blifil  had taken some Pains to prevail with the Parson and to prevent the Discovery at that Time for which he had many Reasons He knew that the Minds of Men are apt to be softened and relaxed from their usual Severity by Sickness Besides he imagined that if the Story was told when the Fact was so recent and the Physician about the House who might have unravelled the real Truth he should never be able to give it the malicious Turn which he intended Again he resolved to hoard up this Business till the Indiscretion of  Jones  should afford some additional Complaints for he thought the joint Weight of many Facts falling upon him together would be the most likely to crush him and he watched therefore some such Opportunity as that with which Fortune had now kindly presented him Lastly by prevailing with  Thwackum  to conceal the Matter for a Time he knew he should confirm an Opinion of his Friendship to  Jones  which he had greatly laboured to establish in Mr  Allworthy  CHAP XI  A short Chapter but which contains sufficient Matter to affect the goodnatured Reader  IT was Mr  Allworthy'  s Custom never to punish any one not even to turn away a Servant in a Passion He resolved therefore to delay his passing Sentence on  Jones  till the Afternoon  The poor young Man attended at Dinner as usual but his Heart was too much loaded to suffer him to eat His Grief was a good deal aggravated by the unkind Looks of Mr  Allworthy  whence he concluded that  Western  had discovered the whole Affair between him and  Sophia  But as to Mr  Blifil'  s Story he had  not the least Apprehension for of much the greater Part he was entirely innocent and for the Residue as he had forgiven and forgotten it himself so he suspected no Remembrance on the other Side When Dinner was over and the Servants departed Mr  Allworthy  began to harangue He set forth in a long Speech the many Iniquities of which  Jones  had been guilty particularly those which this Day had brought to light and concluded by telling him 'that unless he could clear himself of the Charge he was resolved to banish him from his Sight for ever'  Many Disadvantages attended poor  Jones  in making his Defence nay indeed he hardly knew his Accusation For as Mr  Allworthy  in recounting the Drunkenness  c  while he lay ill out of modesty sunk every thing that related particularly to himself which indeed principally constituted the Crime  Jones  could not deny the Charge His Heart was besides almost broken already and his Spirits were so sunk that he could say nothing for himself but acknowledged the whole and like a Criminal in Despair threw himself upon Mercy concluding 'That tho' he must own himself guilty of many Follies and Inadvertencies he hoped he had done nothing to deserve what would be to him the greatest Punishment in the World'  Allworthy  answered 'that he had forgiven him too often already in Compassion to his Youth and in Hopes of his Amendment That he now found he was an abandoned Reprobate and such as it would be criminal in any one to support and encourage Nay' said Mr  Allworthy  to him 'your audacious Attempt to steal away the young Lady calls upon me to justify my own Character in punishing you The World who have already censured the Regard I have for you may think with some Colour at least of Justice that I connive at  so base and barbarous an Action An Action of which you must have known my Abhorrence and which had you any Concern for my Ease and Honour as well as for my Friendship you would never have thought of undertaking Fie upon it young Man indeed there is scarce any Punishment equal to your Crimes and I can scarce think myself justifiable in what I am now going to bestow on you However as I have educated you like a Child of my own I will not turn you naked into the World When you open this Paper therefore you will find something which may enable you with Industry to get an honest Livelihood but if you employ it to worse Purposes I shall not think myself obliged to supply you farther being resolved from this Day forward to converse no more with you on any Account I cannot avoid saying There is no Part of your Conduct which I resent more than your ill Treatment of that good young Man meaning  Blifil  who had behaved with so much Tenderness and Honour towards you'  These last Words were a Dose almost too bitter to be swallowed A Flood of Tears now gushed from the Eyes of  Jones  and every Faculty of Speech and Motion seemed to have deserted him It was some Time before he was able to obey  Allworthy'  s peremptory Commands of departing which he at length did having first kissed his Hands with a Passion difficult to be affected and as difficult be described  The Reader must be very weak if when he considers the Light in which  Jones  then appeared to Mr  Allworthy  he should blame the Rigour of his Sentence And yet all the Neighbourhood either from this Weakness or from a worse Motive condemned this Justice and Severity as the highest Cruelty Nay the very Persons who had before censured the good Man for the Kindness and Tenderness shewn  to a Bastard his own according to the general Opinion now cried out as loudly against turning his own Child out of Doors The Women especially were unanimous in taking the Part of  Jones  and raised more Stories on the Occasion than I have room in this Chapter to set down  One Thing must not be omitted that in their Censures on this Occasion none ever mentioned the Sum contained in the Paper which  Allworthy  gave  Jones  which was no less than Five hundred Pounds but all agreed that he was sent away Pennyless and some said naked from the House of his inhuman Father  CHAP XII  Containing Love Letters  c  JONES  was commanded to leave the House immediately and told that his Clothes and every thing else should be sent to him whithersoever he should order them  He accordingly set out and walked above a Mile not regarding and indeed scarce knowing whither he went At length a little Brook obstructed his Passage he threw himself down by the Side of it nor could he help muttering with some little Indignation 'Sure my Father will not deny me this Place to rest in'  Here he presently fell into the most violent Agonies tearing his Hair from his Head and using most other Actions which generally accompany Fits of Madness Rage and Despair  When he had in this Manner vented the first Emotions of Passion he began to come a little to himself His Grief now took another Turn and discharged itself in a gentler Way till he became at last cool enough to reason with his Passion and to consider what Steps were proper to be taken in his deplorable Condition  And now the great Doubt was how to act with regard to  Sophia  The Thoughts of leaving her almost rent his Heart asunder but the Consideration of reducing her to Ruin and Beggary still racked him if possible more and if the violent Desire of possessing her Person could have suffered him to listen one Moment to the Alternative still he was by no means certain of her Resolution to indulge his Wishes at so high an Expence The Resentment of Mr  Allworthy  and the Injury he must do to his Quiet argued strongly against this latter and lastly the apparent Impossibility of his Success even if he would sacrifice all these Considerations to it came to his Assistance and thus Honour at last backed with Despair with Gratitude to his Benefactor and with real Love to his Mistress got the better of burning Desire and he resolved rather to quit  Sophia  than to pursue her to Ruin  It is difficult for any who have not felt it to conceive the glowing Warmth which filled his Breast on the first Contemplation of this Victory over his Passion Pride flattered him so agreeably that his Mind perhaps enjoyed perfect Happiness but this was only momentary  Sophia  soon returned to his Imagination and allayed the Joy of his Triumph with no less bitter Pangs than a goodnatured General must feel when he surveys the bleeding Heaps at the Price of whose Blood he hath purchased his Laurels for thousands of tender Ideas lay murdered before our Conqueror  Being resolved however to pursue the Paths of this Giant Honour as the gigantic Poet  Lee  calls it he determined to write a farewel to  Sophia  and accordingly proceeded to a House not far off where being furnished with Materials he wrote as follows  MADAM  'WHEN you reflect on the Situation in which I write I am sure your Goodnature will pardon any Inconsistency or Absurdity which my Letter contains for every thing here flows from a Heart so full that no Language can express its Dictates'  'I have resolved Madam to obey your Commands in flying for ever from your dear your lovely Sight Cruel indeed those Commands are but it is a Cruelty which proceeds from Fortune not from my  Sophia  Fortune hath made it necessary necessary to your Preservation to forget there ever was such a Wretch as I am'  'Believe me I would not hint all my Sufferings to you if I imagined they could possibly escape your Ears I know the Goodness and Tenderness of your Heart and would avoid giving you any of those Pains which you always feel for the Miserable O let nothing which you shall hear of my hard Fortune cause a Moment's Concern for after the Loss of you every thing is to me a Trifle'  'O my  Sophia  it is hard to leave you it is harder still to desire you to forget me yet the sincerest Love obliges me to both Pardon my conceiving that any Remembrances of me can give you Disquiet but if I am so gloriously wretched sacrifice me every Way to your Relief Think I never loved you or think truly how little I deserve you and learn to scorn me for a Presumption which can never be too severely punishedI am unable to say moreMay Guardian Angels protect you for ever'  He was now searching his Pockets for his Wax but found none nor indeed any thing else therein for in Truth he had in his frantic Disposition tossed every thing from him and amongst the rest his  Pocketbook which he had received from Mr  Allworthy  which he had never opened and which now first occurred to his Memory  The House supplied him with a Wafer for his present Purpose with which having sealed his Letter he returned hastily towards the Brook Side in order to search for the Things which he had there lost In his Way he met his old Friend  Black George  who heartily condoled with him on his misfortune for this had already reached his Ears and indeed those of all the Neighbours  Jones  acquainted the Gamekeeper with his Loss and he as readily went back with him to the Brook where they searched every Tuft of Grass in the Meadow as well where  Jones  had not been as where he had been but all to no Purpose for they found nothing For indeed though the Things were then in the Meadow they omitted to search the only Place where they were deposited to wit in the Pockets of the said  George  for he had just before found them and being luckily apprized of their Value had very carefully put them up for his own Use  The Gamekeeper having exerted as much Diligence in Quest of lost Goods as if he had hoped to find them desired Mr  Jones  to recollect if he had been in no other Place 'For sure' 'said he 'if you had lost them here so lately the Things must have been here still for this is a very unlikely Place for any one to pass by' and indeed it was by great Accident that he himself had passed through the Field in order to lay the Wires for Hares with which he was to supply a Poulterer at  Bath  the next Morning  Jones  now gave over all Hopes of recovering his Loss and almost all Thoughts concerning it and turning to  Black George  asked him earnestly If he would do him the greatest Favour in the World  'George  answered with some Hesitation Sir you know you may command me whatever is in my Power and I heartily wish it was in my Power to do you any Service' In fact the Question staggared him for he had by selling Game amassed a pretty good Sum of Money in Mr  Western'  s Service and was afraid that  Jones  wanted to borrow some small Matter of him but he was presently relieved from his Anxiety by being desired to convey a Letter to  Sophia  which with great Pleasure he promised to do And indeed I believe there are few Favours which he would not have gladly conferred on Mr  Jones  for he bore as much Gratitude towards him as he could and was as honest as Men who love Money better than any other Thing in the Universe generally are  Mrs  Honour  was agreed by both to be the proper Means by which this Letter should pass to  Sophia  They then separated the Gamekeeper returned home to Mr  Western'  s and  Jones  walked to an Alehouse at half a Mile's Distance to wait for his Messenger's Return  George  no sooner came home to his Master's House than he met with Mrs  Honour  to whom having first sounded her with a few previous Questions he delivered the Letter for her Mistress and received at the same Time another from her for Mr  Jones  which  Honour  told him she had carried all that Day in her Bosom and began to despair of finding any Means of delivering it  The Gamekeeper returned hastily and joyfully to  Jones  who having received  Sophia'  s Letter from him instantly withdrew and eagerly breaking it open read as follows  SIR  'IT is impossible to express what I have felt since I saw you Your submitting on my Account to  such cruel Insults from my Father lays me under an Obligation I shall ever own As you know his Temper I beg you will for my Sake avoid him I wish I had any Comfort to send you but believe this that nothing but the last Violence shall ever give my Hand or Heart where you would be sorry to see them bestowed'  Jones  read this Letter a hundred Times over and kissed it a hundred Times as often His Passion now brought all tender Desires back into his Mind He repented that he had writ to  Sophia  in the Manner we have seen above but he repented more that he had made use of the Interval of his Messenger's Absence to write and dispatch a Letter to Mr  Allworthy  in which he had faithfully promised and bound himself to quit all Thoughts of his Love However when his cool Reflections returned he plainly perceived that his Case was neither mended nor altered by  Sophia'  s Billet unless to give him some little Glimpse of Hope from her Constancy of some favourable Accident hereafter He therefore resumed his Resolution and taking leave of  Black George  set forward to a Town about five Miles distant whither he had desired Mr  Allworthy  unless he pleased to revoke his Sentence to send his Things after him  CHAP XIII  The Behaviour of  Sophia  on the present Occasion which none of her Sex will blame who are capable of behaving in the same Manner And the Discussion of a knotty Point in the Court of Conscience  SOPHIA  had passed the last twentyfour Hours in no very desirable Manner During a large Part of them she had been entertained by her Aunt with Lectures of Prudence recommending to her the Example of the polite World where Women consider  Matrimony as Men do Offices of public Trust only as the means of making their Fortunes and of advancing themselves in the World In commenting on which Text Mrs  Western  had displayed her Eloquence several Hours  These sagacious Lectures though little suited either to the Taste or Inclination of  Sophia  were however less irksome to her than her own Thoughts that formed the Entertainment of the Night during which she never once closed her Eyes  But though she could neither sleep nor rest in her Bed yet having no Avocation from it she was found there by her Father at his return from  Allworthy'  s which was not till past Ten o'Clock in the Morning He went directly up to her Apartment opened the Door and seeing she was not upcried 'Oh you are safe then and I am resolved to keep you so' He then locked the Door and delivered the Key to  Honour  having first given her the strictest Charge with great Promises of Rewards for her Fidelity and most dreadful Menaces of Punishment in case she should betray her Trust  Honour'  s Orders were not to suffer her Mistress to come out of her Room without the Authority of the Squire himself and to admit none to her but him and her Aunt but she was herself to attend her with whatever  Sophia  pleased except only Pen Ink and Paper of which she was forbidden the Use  The Squire ordered his Daughter to dress herself and attend him at Dinner which she obeyed and having sat the usual Time was conducted to her Prison  In the Evening the Goaler  Honour  brought her the Letter which she received from the Gamekeeper  Sophia  read it very attentively twice or thrice over and then threw herself upon the Bed and burst into a Flood of Tears Mrs  Honour  expressed great Astonishment at this Behaviour in her Mistress nor  could she forbear very eagerly begging to know the Cause of this Passion  Sophia  made her no Answer for some Time and then starting suddenly up caught her Maid by the Hand and cried 'O  Honour  I am undone' 'I wish the Letter had been burnt before I had brought it to your La'ship I'm sure I thought it would have comforted your La'ship or I would have seen it at the Devil before I would have touch'd it'  'Honour  says  Sophia  'you are a good Girl and it is vain to attempt concealing longer my Weakness from you I have thrown away my Heart on a Man who hath forsaken me' And is Mr  Jones  answered the Maid 'such a Perfidy Man' 'He hath taken his Leave of me' says  Sophia  'for ever in that Letter Nay he hath desired me to forget him Could he have desired that if he had loved me Could he have borne such a Thought could he have written such a Word' No certainly Ma'am' cries  Honour  'and to be sure if the best Man in  England  was to desire me to forget him I'd take him at his Word Marry come up I am sure your La'ship hath done him too much Honour ever to think on him A young Lady who may take her Choice of all the young Men in the County And to be sure if I may be so presumptious as to offer my poor Opinion there is young Mr  Blifil  who besides that he is come of honest Parents and will be one of the greatest Squires all hereabouts he is to be sure in my poor Opinion a more handsomer and a more politer Man by half and besides he is a young Gentleman of a sober Character and may defy any of the Neighbours to say black is his Eye He follows no dirty Trollops nor can any Bastards be laid at his Door Forget him indeed I thank Heaven I myself am not so much at my last Prayers as to suffer any Man to bid me forget him twice If the best He that wears a Head was for to go for to offer for to  say such an affronting Word to me I would never give him my Company afterwards if there was another young Man in the Kingdom And as I was a saying to be sure there is young Mr  Blifil  Name not his detested Name' cries  Sophia  'Nay Ma'am says  Honour  if your La'ship doth not like him there be more jolly handsome young Men that would court your La'ship if they had but the least Encouragement I don't believe there is arrow young Gentleman in this County or the next to it that if your La'ship was but to look as if you had a Mind to him would not come about to make his Offers directly' 'What a Wretch dost thou imagine me' cries  Sophia  'by affronting my Ears with such Stuff I detest all Mankind' 'Nay to be sure Ma'am' answered  Honour  'your La'ship hath had enough to give you a Surfeit of them To be used ill by such a poor beggarly bastardly Fellow' Hold your blasphemous Tongue' cries  Sophia  how dare you mention his Name with Disrespect before me He use me ill No his poor bleeding Heart suffered more when he writ the cruel Words than mine from reading them O he is all heroic Virtue and Angelic Goodness I am ashamed of the Weakness of my own Passion for blaming what I ought to admireO  Honour  it is my good only which he consults To my Interest he sacrifices both himself and meThe Apprehension of ruining me hath driven him to Despair' 'I am very glad says  Honour  'to hear your La'ship takes that into your Consideration for to be sure it must be nothing less than Ruin to give your Mind to one that is turned out of Doors and is not worth a Farthing in the World 'Turned out of Doors cries  Sophia  hastily 'how what dost thou mean 'Why to be sure Ma'am my Master no sooner told Squire  Allworthy  about Mr  Jones  having offered to make Love to your  'Ladyship than the Squire stripped him stark naked and turned him out of Doors 'Ha says  Sophia  have I been the cursed wretched Cause of his DestructionTurned naked out of Doors Here  Honour  take all the Money I have take the Rings from my FingersHere my Watch carry him allGo find him immediately For Heaven's Sake Ma'am answered Mrs  Honour  'do but consider if my Master should miss any of these Things I should be made to Answer for them Therefore let me beg your Ladyship not to part with your Watch and Jewels Besides the Money I think is enough of all Conscience and as for that my Master can never know any thing of the Matter' 'Here then' cries  Sophia  take every Farthing I am worth find him out immediately and' give it him Go go lose not a Moment  Mrs  Honour  departed according to Orders and finding  Black George  below Stairs delivered him the Purse which contained Sixteen Guineas being indeed the whole Stock of  Sophia  For tho' her Father was very liberal to her she was much too generous herself to be rich  Black George  having received the Purse set forward towards the Alehouse but in the Way a Thought occurred to him whether he should not detain this Money likewise His Conscience however immediately started at this Suggestion and began to upbraid him with Ingratitude to his Benefactor To this his Avarice answered 'That his Conscience should have considered that Matter before when he deprived poor  Jones  of his  l  That having quietly acquiesced in what was of so much greater Importance it was absurd if not downright Hypocrisy to affect any Qualms at this Trifle' In return to which Conscience like a good Lawyer attempted to distinguish between an absolute Breach of Trust as here where the Goods were delivered  and a bare Concealment of what was found as in the former Case Avarice presently treated this with Ridicule called it a Distinction without a Difference and absolutely insisted that when once all Pretensions of Honour and Virtue were given up in any one Instance that there was no Precedent for resorting to them upon a second Occasion In short poor Conscience had certainly been defeated in the Argument had not Fear stept in to her Assistance and very strenuously urged that the real Distinction between the two Actions did not lie in the different Degrees of Honour but of Safety For that the secreting the  l  was a Matter of very little Hazard whereas the detaining the Sixteen Guineas was liable to the utmost Danger of Discovery  By this friendly Aid of Fear Conscience obtained a compleat Victory in the Mind of  Black George  and after making him a few Compliments on his Honesty forced him to deliver the Money to  Jones  CHAP XIV  A short Chapter containing a short Dialogue between Squire  Western  and his Sister  MRS  Western  had been engaged abroad all that Day The Squire met her at her Return home and when she enquired after  Sophia  he acquainted her that he had secured her safe enough 'She is locked up in Chamber' cries he 'and  Honour  keeps the Key' As his Looks were full of prodigious Wisdom and Sagacity when he gave his Sister this Information it is probable he expected much Applause from her for what he had done but how was he disappointed when with a most disdainful Aspect she cried 'Sure Brother you are the weakest of all Men Why will you not confide in me for the Management of my Niece Why will you interpose  You have now undone all that I have been spending my Breath in order to bring about While I have been endeavouring to fill her Mind with Maxims of Prudence you have been provoking her to reject them  English  Women Brother I thank Heaven are no Slaves We are not to be locked up like the  Spanish  and  Italian  Wives We have as good a Right to Liberty as yourselves We are to be convinced by Reason and Persuasion only and not governed by Force I have seen the World Brother and know what Arguments to make Use of and if your Folly had not prevented me should have prevailed with her to form her Conduct by those Rules of Prudence and Discretion which I formerly taught her' 'To be sure' said the Squire I am always in the Wrong' 'Brother' answered the Lady 'you are not in the Wrong unless when you meddle with Matters beyond your Knowledge You must agree that I have seen most of the World and happy had it been for my Niece if she had not been taken from under my Care It is by living at home with you that she hath learnt romantick Notions of Love and Nonsense' 'You don't imagine I hope' cries the Squire 'that I have taught her any such Things' Your Ignorance Brother' returned she 'as the great  Milton  says almost subdues my Patience'  The Reader may perhaps subdue his own Patience if he searches for this in  Milton  'Dn  Milton'  answered the Squire 'if he had the Impudence to say so to my Face I'd lend him a Douse thof he was never so great a Man Patience an you come to that Sister I have more Occasion of Patience to be used like an overgrown Schoolboy as I am by' you Do you think no one hath any Understanding  unless he hath been about at Court Pox the World is come to a fine Pass indeed if we are all Fools except a Parcel of Roundheads and  Hannover  Rats Pox I hope the Times are a coming that we shall make Fools of them and every Man shall enjoy his own That's all Sister and every man shall enjoy his own I hope to  zee  it Sister before the  Hannover  Rats have eat up all our Corn and left us nothing but Turneps to feed upon' 'I protest Brother' cries she 'you are now got beyond my Understanding Your Jargon of Turneps and  Hannover  Rats is to me perfectly unintelligible' 'I believe' cries he 'you don't care to hear o'em but the country Interest may succeed one Day or other for all that 'I wish' answered the Lady 'you would think a little of your Daughter's Interest For believe me she is in greater Danger than the Nation' 'Just now' said he you chid me for thinking on her and would ha' her left to you' 'And if you will promise to interpose on more' answered she 'I will out of my Regard to my Niece undertake the Charge' 'Well do then' said the Squire 'for you know I always agreed that Women are the properest to manage Women'  Mrs  Western  then departed muttering something with an Air of Disdain concerning Women and the Management of the Nation She immediately repaired to  Sophia'  s Apartment who was now after a Day's Confinement released again from her Captivity  The End of the First Volume
