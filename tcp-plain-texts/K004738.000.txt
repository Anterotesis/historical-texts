 A Farther Continuation OF THE HISTORY OF THE CrownInn  PART III  Containing the present State of the INN and other Particulars  LONDON  Printed for J MOOR and Sold by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price  d  A Farther Continuation OF THE HISTORY OF THE CrownInn  c  _IN my last I told you what furious Pretentions were made to Mr WRIGHT's Favour by a Set of Fellows who you will conclude little deserve it and if you consider that the greatest part of that Letter was writ before His coming to Town you will likewise agree that I spoke somewhat like a Prophet  But indeed what is easier than to foresee Things which have such natural and unavoidable  Consequences for nothing but the grossest Impudence as well as the most absurd and vain Conceptions could have given them the least Pretence to it or have urg'd them to hope what they were neither intituled to or qualified for  They were very officious in their Attendance on Mr WRIGHT when he arrived near the Town and as suppliant as Spaniels in their Sycophantick  Devoires  They feigned and wrung out an hundred Compliments which he took littlenotice of But of all you would have laught heartily at  BOB  with his  INVIOLABLE ATTACH  and  boasted Interest BOB  after all was fain to implore the Favour to be introduced and when he had duck'd himself into a low and obsequious Cringe as he drew near Mr WRIGHT by a sudden Presence of Mind turned his back upon him and poor  BOB  's Countenance fell like a  WeatherGlass  at the Alteration of the Weather  This admirable Farce wou'd have lasted much longer to the great Diversion of the Town but that Mr WRIGHT who is the most free and unaffected Man living and cannot endure any thing that looks like constraint or servile Flattery resolved not to be pester'd with 'em and therefore by dismissing  Jacob Rush Sim  and some other of the  King leaders  designed to convince the rest  what he thought of their Company and that he was capable to distinguish those who had merited from him from those who had not  You will hardly believe me when I tell you that the  CURATE  had the Impudence to appear publickly at the  INN  Surely the Front of that Fellow must be of the most solid and obdurate Brass Can it be forgot how often he has drank young  Shute  's Health and preach'd up his Interest by Inumendo's in direct opposition to Mr WRIGHT's Succession Is any thing more notorious unless his own corrupt Life than his encouraging his Enemies both in Life and Doctrine How often has he been drunk at the  PopesHead  the  CrossKeys  and  Mitre  with the Friends of young  Shute  For he promotes no House that is not even in its very Description well affected to him Was this a Wretch now to appear barefaced to Mr WRIGHT or can any thing better discribe the unaccountable Vanity of an unthinking termagant Party  The Conclusion of this was that the Wretch was hustled out of the House and had been buffeted but out of deference to his  Coat  Can you divine now what should be in the Man's Head His Friends indeed according to their usual Vanity said we shou'd  see him a Bp but could even the most stupid  Clodpate  alive really hope or believe this after he saw his Confederates under the deplorable Circumstances of  Disgrace  and the  Interest  entirely sunk that could support his unjust Pretensions Well of all the Senceless furious Creatures that breath in the open Regions of the Air commend me to the  CURATE  and his Party for something very ridiculous and out of the common Road and Propriety of Thinking  A Friend of mine gives a very good turn to this and says it was a Design of the Party to send him thither on purpose to be affronted thereby to give a second handle to enflame the Mob as at an Injury or Disrespect offered to the  Church  and this to be sounded by the  Trumpets of Zion  among the People I will grant for once they may be capable to Think for there are some shallow  Tricksters  among them and therefore my Friends Notion may be just but if ever they are hanged for  Conjurers  I'll be Shot or throw my self out of the Window as an Auspicious  Patron  of his did when he remembered the irreparable Injury he had done his Country by  Charioting  and Countenancing such a pernicious  Incendiary  Upon the whole the Party have now changed their Sentiments it is at length beaten into their fortified Skulls that their  mighty Pretences to Mr WRIGHT's Favour were frivilous and without Ground They do not so warmly and proudly affirm now  That they were the Men who brought him in  and all the Love and previous Grimaces and the faint Acclamations before his Arrival are turned into dull and insignificant  Shruggs  The glorious  Changes  at the  INN  have almost work'd them into their Ancient Spirit The Consternation is great but they have always a Body of Reserve ready to sustain them under the most shocking and terrible Defeats It is pleasant to hear these Fellows who but a few Days ago were heard to utter the most melodious Things imaginable of Mr WRIGHT now assume a dogmatical Air of reasoning upon his Conduct and straining themselves into ambiguous and ridiculous Hints as if his known and celebrated Virtue were any way in the Case of discountenancing such a pack of deep Mouth'd  Curs  that are always full Cry in running down  Truth  and  Innocence  and where they have neither Courage nor Honesty to speak their Minds are Villains enough to make distant and raskally Reflections But let them take care for we have a substantial pair of  Stocks  here and a  WhippingPost  of the fittest Magnitude equal to the brawniest Back of the most Sizeable Villain among them besides two sturdy young  Elms  at the  Townsend that grew in a true Protestant Country where HEREDITARY RIGHT SLAVERY and ARBITRARY POWER were never heard off  I am vexed that I must trouble you with such Trifles as these but I shall never get through my Purpose without letting you into these little Details nor wou'd you be so capable to relish Things more momentous if you were not truely possessed of the present State and litigious Spirit of the Party You remember what they were in Power and 'tis proper you shou'd know what they are in  Adversity  They forget the old Proverb  That Sawce for the Goose is Sawce for the Gander  What havock they made in turning out the  Old Servants  upon the most frivolous Pretences and what a Scrabling they made to get their Fingers into the  Widow's Dish  Never was such a Set of  Cormorants  known they devoured by wholesale yet went on with eager Complaints against the  Old Servants  the better to conceal their own voracious Stomachs One was accused of taking  Half Penny Rolls  out of the  Bakers  Basket another for Embezling the  Hay and Oats  and a third for receiving  Reckonings  and not bringing the Money to the  Bar  But for Truth they left that to be made out by  Jonathan Wormwood  their  Amanuensis  a very  bitter  Fellow against all the  old Servants  a witty facetious Varlet and a  and hanger on to  Bob  who kept him for such Purposes for which he was excellently qualified for he was as wicked as his Heart could wish and had the best Talent at  Railery  and  Lies  a Man could possibly be enduedwithal  How he handled the  Widow's Friends  and  Servants  you have heard already it was however equal to the Justice and Candour of all their other Proceedings and helpt to furnish half the Blockheads in Town of that Party with Matter to hold an Argument Some drew the whole  Rigmaro  into a kind of useful Common Place for the greater Ease to their Memory's and every  Jackdaw  or  Owl  in Town could hoot out some senceless Lesson taken from his Scurrilous Memoirs  Bob  had half a Dozen of these Fellows at his Beck who hated him heartily but for the Bread they receiv'd out of the  Widow's Basket  Every Raskal had his separate Instructions To one it was given to blacken the  Widow's  Friends and shew the Necessity of coming to an Agreement without them to another to render our own Condition desperate the better to frighten People into a Sence of it a third was to run down the Credit of the Old Servants and cry up the great Honesty of the new a fourth to discant on the  Church  a fifth on  Trade  and a sixth incessantly to cry out  Faction Plots wicked Designs  c and keep the Town in continual Alarm to  prevent their cooling or recovering their proper Sences  These  Tools  as infamous as they were answer'd the Ends they were employed on the Mob especially and the most unthinking and injudicious People were taken by the Ears and listened to them with great Attention and by such Mountebank Methods the Credit of their Proceedings at the  Inn  was wholly supported  The  Widow  poor Woman they kept up in her Chamber and persuaded her that her appearing below Stairs might be prejudicial to her Health and that every thing went on well and her  Customers  appeared all very much pleased with their Entertainment So that she seldome came into the  Bar  unless now and then on a  Marketday  or so or at a CLUBSUPPER when it was necessary for her to pass some  Accounts  The Rogues had indeed some Reason to say she was misled and abused by the Old Servants if they judged from the result of their own Conduct for they found she was a perfect easie Woman and if her  Tenants  and  Customers  were but pleased with their Usage she seldome enquired further and they took special Care that none of the Old Servants might come near her and stifled all Letters by the Post when they suspected the Hand Writing for  fear she shou'd get any Intelligence of the true State of the  House  They were taking all other Methods they could think on to make the Game sure when they differed among themselves about the Means and to the great Satisfaction of the Town fell together by the Ears  Nab  like an ungrateful Slut as she was had not that regard to the Advancement  Bob  had been a Means to promote her to and perhaps there was something in it more than ordinary  Bob  was on the decline aged Fiftyfive and upwards of a temperate and phlegmatick Constitution  Harry  was in the meridian of his Days a robust young Dog full of Life and Fire with a vigorous Shape strong Back and hale Complexion fed high and had an amorous Soul of his own The Rogue has good Blood in his Veins too but no more the Son of old  HARRY  than I am of  Jupiter  The old Man disowns his Proceedings and says he always feared he would come to some violent End from his turbulent disobedient Spirit That his Mother rest her Soul dreamt of a  Comet  the Night she was delivered of him and could never govern him as he shou'd be Nay you must know the young Knave took up a Belt against his own Father once at a WRESTLING and threw him out of the  Ring  But to proceed  Harry  by these strong Persuasions drew  Nab  into his Party Not that she has many  Babies  to be seen in her Eyes for they have for some Years past displayed but a very dull Water yet the Jade had a feeling Conception of the foregoing Qualifications and there was an excellent Character stirring of his singular Talent that Way  Nab Evesdropt  dropp'd all that pass'd between the  VVidow  and  Bob  and gave  Harry  an Account still and took all Opportunities to improve Things to his Advantage for I should have told you that  Nab  according to  Bob  's Prediction was by this Time become a Lady and I can assure you valued herself not a little upon it She looked as much above her former  Occupation  as an  Upstart 'Squire  does above a  Hack  when he has dipt the ANTIENT SEAT for a Gilt Chariot and a Pair of  Swiss Tails Nab  was  Hand and Glove  with the  VVidow  and not a Pin could be stuck right if it was not of  Nab  's doing for  Nab  had been well brought up and could handle her Needle tiff up a Fall below or do any other Work as well as Drudgery tho' the BEESOM was indeed the most exquisitely adapted to her Hands of any other Perquisite of her Office  Nab  kept the  VVidow's Purse  and bought  Perfumes Powder  and  Patches  c and made many a round Penny of her Markettings She had  a Liquorish Tooth of her own and loved a Cordial at her Heart which she always posted in her Bill of Incidents They say 'twas pretty large at the  VVidow's  Death  There were other of the Female Servants at the INN violently attached to  Harry  's Person through the Impression of his smug Countenance and brawny Shoulders No  Page  cou'd swallow  QuinceMarmalet  more greedily than these  Simpering Baggages  did the Complimental Addresses of the young  Brazier  every one believing like  Don John  's six Wives  That she was the VVoman  and each putting herself forward with the greatest Address to serve him and render him gracious in the Eyes of the  VVidow  This it is to have the Reputation of being what we call  a VVoman's Man Bob  with all his Politick Airs and Set Faces could not conjure himself into the Womens Graces and  Harry  had a favourable Gift beyond all the Magick of his  VVand Harry  wou'd Dance with them on the Green play at  DropGlove StoolBall  and the like which  Bob  was too feeble and stiff in the Hams for and could only figh that he had introduced such a Smockfaced young  VVhoresbird  to Supplant him  Thus you see by what Measures  Harry  carried his Point and engag'd the  Private Services  of these  Female Advocates  whose short Triumph and sudden Fall is now the Subject of their Tears and Concern Realy the Fellow might be very happy could he but lay aside Ambition and confine himself to a rural kind of Life The great Resort of Females his Reputation wou'd soon draw about him could not but afford a very happy Prospect of Pleasure to one who is by Nature fitlier qualified for the lacivious Drudgery of a  Seraglio  than the Gravity of Publick Business In short  Harry  's a very pretty Fellow and a boon Companion but the Rogue was so near sacrificing his Country he's never to be trusted at the INN more if he comes off no worse  I must not forget that I promised you an Account of the present State thereof I concluded with telling you of the several  Changes  made at the INN and what was likely to ensue  Charles  the  HeadOstler  and  Ned Topsail  as I hinted are both restored to their Places Honest  VVill Truby  has jostled that queer Fellow  Jack Squeamish  out of his STEWARDSHIP and  Frank Stirrup  Son of old  Ralph  the  Cashkeeper  has received the Keys of the COFFER  again from the reluctant Hands of  Nab  's enabled  Consort  Every thing looks with a good Aspect and the House begins to appear in its ancient Grandeur You may remember in what a Plight you left us Solitary and Disconsolate our Credit sunk our Trade cramp'd and ruin'd the  Country  Beggard and the INN in the Hands of a Set of Arbritrary Fellows that drove on  Jehu  like to our Destruction our Friends affronted and discouraged Honest Men put out of all and none but a parcel of indefeasible Raskals preferr'd who deserved hanging for their known Zeal to young  Shute  But you will now find us with smiling Countenances chearful Spirits and composed Minds We could hardly speak before for fear of our  Taskmasters  but we dare now Nose those Villains that used to gibe us Men of Integrity are only looked on at the INN and to have been well attached to the New LANDLORD is the best Argument for present Merit  Robin Bold  the Plummer  Dick Filedust  the Smith  Nick SilverTongue  the Lapidary and the rest of the honest Lads that stood titely for him at the last WRESTLING are brought into Play again and are ready to take up a  Cudgel  on the  same side  whenever Occasion offers They threaten us hard in some Parts  of the  Country  but we have as good as carried the  Belt  in this  Town  already almost two to one and we doubt not but to shew 'em fair Play for it every where else We have a Parcel of mettled Lads that have been used to Sport and are not afraid of a broken Head or two if it comes to the Push  You may remember I always told you  Things  could not last long as they went on and 'tis confirmed what I told you in my First that the  VVidow  designed to have made great Alterations at the  INN  had she recovered 'Tis likewise as certain that they broke her Heart among them by discovering one anothers Rogueries when they fell out Poor Woman they had harrass'd her so for Years together and made her break her Words often with her honest  Friends  and  Tenants  that when she came once to reflect it cast her into such a deep Melancholy as carried her precipitately to the Grave In her last Intervals she entered into the following  Soliloquy  to this Effect  "Unhappy Woman have I for this so long eat the Bread of Carefulness Took Pains early and late to promote a Trade and gain Reputation to the INN on purpose to make all thy  Tenants  and  Customers  easie and happy And is all my Trouble and Care come to this at last It was not so says she in the Days of my old Servants My Affairs went well then  and nothing I undertook but was Successful I had a Reputation far and near and was esteemed and courted even by my very Adversaries My Tenants and Customers were perpetually Rejoicing but I fear I have now given them too great an Occasion for Sorrow Could I recal a little Time  But I shall ne'er outlive it  I wou'd endeavour to remove the Cause and make them all easie again But this is reserved for Heaven and my Successor Tell my poor  People  I dye theirs and yet I am sorry I cannot do more to redress them before I depart  This said she turned about and with a Sigh breathed out her Soul to him that gave it  Were these Fellows capable of Correction sure this would have some effect on them But I despair of ever seeing them shew the least Signs of Grace and Repentance  You have heard how they wou'd have insinuated themselves into Mr WRIGHT'S Favour and what a fawning and cringing they used at first but when they saw he was not to be cajoled and made a very just Distinction of their Proceedings toward him by clearing the  House  of them they presently changed their Notes and are forming a Cabal against his Conduct  The rewarding the long and eminent Services of honest  John Trusty  is one of the greatest  Cuts  to 'em of all for tho' they bear the rest with Spleen and Impatience enough yet there is in this a double Portion of Acrimony  John  was the Honour and Support of the old  Servants  and the Terror and Disgrace of the  New John  caried the CAUSE against Old  Savage  for many Years together to the great Disadvantage of their Idol Young  Shute John  refused to Countenance their Schemes in making the Composition and rather chose to retire out of the Country than breath the same Air with such Villains as seemed to have abandoned all Faith and Honour and were driving at the Ruin of their Country And if that Raskal  Slyboots  had nothing else to answer but the Persecution and ill Treatment of this worthy Man that were enough never to have him forgiven  How easie it is to guess the Rage and Ferment these Fellows are in at Mr WRIGHT's glorious Proceedings They say  he begins too soon moves too fast and that this cannot last long  with other such rediculous Stuff But these are rather their Wishes than their Sentiments both which are as much below his Resentment as the senceless Reflection of the Party He came here to govern and chose rather to shew them that he saw no  Reason to conceal his Resentment nor to continue Men about him whom he cou'd not chuse but be uneasie at and if they have any Modesty they ought to believe themselves obnoxious and make a silent Retreat That there was more Sincerity and Justice in opening himself freely at first and letting them see he had no Reason to disguise himself than to act in Deference to their Judgment or have any regard to the censure of People he had so little reason to value They Mistake he has both too much Courage and too much Honesty to endeavour to veil his Conduct or proceed with the least regard to their empty Commendations  Hipocrisie  was Property a rather becoming the last Three Years than the Prudence Justice Honour and excellent Management of the New LANDLORD whose  Rule  is TO REWARD HIS FRIENDS DO JUSTICE TO HIS ENEMIES AND FEAR NONE  They are endeavouring to possess the People that he designs to curtail the Dignity of the INN by reducing the Gates two Foot narrower in Circumference to prohibit the  Eating of Beef  abridge the Servants Wages and allow them only Small Beer at their Victuals and finally that he intends to take down the  Steeple  and employ the  Stones  and  Rubbish  to make a  Fence  for the  Conventicle  with other  preposterous  Cant  Then to give terrible Ideas of his Person They represent him with a furious stern Look and a Head like a  Dragon  with Scales and Fins like a Fish and with such like incredible Stuff endeavour to make an Impression on the People but let them go on when they have  Lyed  till they are weary of it the  Banter  will end in their own Shame and Confusion  I could enlarge egregiously on his admirable Qualities the great Temperance Justice Candour and Moderation of his Temper but I shall omit it till a more favourable Opportunity having already almost fill'd up my Scrole  I had almost forgot to tell you that some unlucky Knaves in a Picture spread privately about have drawn poor  Harry  in  Deep Mourning  with the LEAGUE in one Hand and a  Halter  in the other The  Hangman  carrying an  Axe  before him with the  Edge  toward him In the upper Copartment is the Gallows  hung  in  BlackBayes  for  Arthur Skipkennel Matt the TavernBoy Con  and some of the rest of them  c  I am yours  c  FINIS
