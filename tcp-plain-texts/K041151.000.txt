THO WARTON  A M  of Trinity Coll Set to Music by Dr HAYES Professor of Music  OXFORD  Printed for R CLEMENTS and  BARRETT W THURLBOURNE in  Cambridge▪  ODE FOR MUSIC  I  Recitative Accomp  WHERE shall the Muse that on the sacred shell  Of men in arts and arms renown'd  The solemn strain delights to swell  Oh where shall Clio chuse a race  Whom Fame with every laurel every grace  Like those of Albion's envied isle has crown'd  Chorus  Daughter and mistress of the sea  Allhonour'd Albion hail  Where'er thy Commerce spreads the swelling sail  Ne'er shall she find a land like thee  So brave so learned and so free  Allhonour'd Albion hail  II  Recitative  But in this princely land of all that's good and great  Would Clio seek the most distinguish'd feat  Most blest where all is so sublimely blest  That with superior grace o'erlooks the rest  Like a rich gem in circling gold enshrin'd  Air  I  Where Isis' waters wind  Along the sweetest shore  That ever felt fair Culture's hands  Or Spring's embroider'd mantle wore  Lo where majestic OXFORD stands  Chorus  Virtue's awful throne  Wisdom's immortal source  Recitative  Thee well her best belov'd may boasting Albion own  Whence each fair purpose of ingenuous praise  All that in thought or deed divine is deem'd  In one unbounded tide one unremitted course  From age to age has still successive stream'd  Where Learning and where Liberty have nurst  For those that in their ranks have shone the first  Their most luxuriant growth of everblooming bays  III  Recitative Accomp  In antient days when She the Queen endu'd  With more than female fortitude  Bonduca led her painted ranks to fight  Oft times in adamantine arms array'd  Pallas descended from the realms of light  Imperial Britonesse thy kindred aid  As once allglowing from the wellfought day  The Goddess sought a cooling stream  By chance inviting with their glassy gleam  Fair Isis' waters flow'd not far away  Eager she view'd the wave  On the cool bank she bar'd her breast  To the soft gale her locks ambrosial gave  And thus the watry nymph addrest  Air  II  Hear gentle nymph whoe'er thou art  Thy sweet refreshing stores impart  A goddess from thy mossy brink  Asks of thy crystal stream to drink  Lo Pallas asks the friendly gift  Thy coralcrowned tresses lift  Rise from the wave propitious pow'r  IV  Recitative  Her accents Isis' calm attention caught  As lonesome in her secret cell  In evervarying hues as mimic fancy taught  She rang'd the manytinctur'd shell  Then from her work arose the Nais mild  Air  III  She rose and sweetly smil'd  With a many a lovely look  That whisper'd soft consent  Recitative  She smil'd and gave the goddess in her flood  To dip her casque tho' dy'd in recent blood  While Pallas as the boon she took  Thus pour'd the grateful sentiment  Air  IV  For this thy flood the fairest name  Of all Britannia's streams shall glide  Best fav'rite of the sons of fame  Of every tuneful breast the pride  For on thy borders bounteous queen  Where now the cowslip paints the green  With unregarded grace  Her wanton herds where Nature feeds  As lonesome o'er the breezy reeds  Lo there to wisdom's Goddess dear  A farfam'd City shall her turrets rear  Recitative  There all her force shall Pallas prove  Of classic leaf with every crown  Each olive meed of old renown  Each antient wreath which Athens wove  I'll bid her blooming bow'rs abound  And Oxford's sacred seats shall tow'r  To thee mild Nais of the flood  The trophy of my gratitude  The temple of my pow'r  V  Recitative  Nor was the pious promise vain  Soon illustrious Alfred came  And pitch'd fair Wisdom's tent on Isis' plenteous plain  Alfred on thee shall all the Muses wait  Air  V  Chorus  Alfred majestic name  Of all our praise the spring  Thee all thy sons shall sing  Deck'd with the martial and the civic wreath  In notes most awful shall the trumpet breath  To thee GREAT ROMULUS of Learning's richest state  VI  Recitative  Nor Alfred's bounteous hand alone  Oxford thy rising temples own  Soon many a man munificent  The prince the prelate laurelcrowned croud  Their ample bounty lent  To build the beauteous monument  That Pallas vow'd  Recitative Accomp  And now she lifts her head sublime  Majestic in the moss of time  Nor wants there Graecia's better part  'Mid the proud piles of antient art  Whose fretted spires with ruder hand  Wainflet and Wickham bravely plan'd  Nor decent Doric to dispense  New charms 'mid old magnificence  And here and there soft Corinth weaves  Her daedal coronet of leaves  Duett  While as with rival pride their tow'rs invade the sky  Radcliffe and Bodley seem to vye  Which shall deserve the foremost place  Or Gothic strength or Attic grace  VII  Recitative  O His ever will I chant thy praise  Not that thy sons have struck the golden lyre  With hands most skillful have their brows entwin'd  With every fairest flow'r of Helicon  The sweetest swans of all th' harmonious choir  Have bade the musing mind  Of every science pierce the pathless ways  And from the rest the wreath of wisdom won  Air  VI▪  But that thy sons have dar'd to feel  For freedom's cause a sacred zeal  With British breast and patriot pride  Have still Corruption's cup defy'd  In dangerous days untaught to fear  Have held the name of honour dear  VIII  Recitative  But chief on this illustrious day  The Muse her loudest Paeans loves to pay  Erewhile she strove with accents weak  In vain to build the lofty rhyme  At length by better days of bounty chear'd  She dares unfold her wing  Air  VII  Hail hour of transport most sublime  In which the man rever'd  Immortal CREW commands to sing  And gives the pipe to breathe the string to speak  IX  Chorus  Blest prelate hail  Most pious patron most triumphant theme  From whose auspicious hand  On Isis' towers new beauties beam  New praise her NURSING FATHERS gain  Immortal CREW  Blest prelate hail  Recitative  E'en now fir'd fancy sees thee lead  To Fame's highseated fane  The shouting band  O'er every hallowed head  Fame's choicest wreaths she sees thee spread  Alfred superior smiles the solemn scene to view  Air  VIII  And bids the Goddess lift  Her loudest trumpet to proclaim  O CREW thy consecrated gift  And echo with his own in social strains thy name  Chorus  repeated  FINIS
