 CURIOUS PARTICULARS AND GENUINE ANECDOTES RESPECTING THE LATE Lord CHESTERFIELD and DAVID HUME Esq  PRICE TWO SHILLINGS  CURIOUS PARTICULARS AND GENUINE ANECDOTES RESPECTING THE LATE Lord CHESTERFIELD and DAVID HUME Esq WITH A PARALLEL between these celebrated PERSONAGES AND AN  Impartial Character of Lord Chesterfield  TO WHICH IS ADDED A SHORT VINDICATION OF THE CHRISTIAN CAUSE AND CHARACTER OCCASIONED BY A RECENT REFLECTION THROWN UPON THEM BY THE AUTHOR OF THE APOLOGY FOR THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF DAVID HUME  BY A FRIEND TO RELIGIOUS AND CIVIL LIBERTY  LONDON  PRINTED FOR G KEARSLEY AT JOHNSON'S HEAD NO IN FLEET STREET  PREFACE  INTERESTING particulars and genuine anecdotes relative to justly celebrated personages have been generally well received by the public In  political life  as well as in the  republic  of  letters  few have been more admired than the late LORD CHESTERFIELD and DAVID HUME We have accordingly had their  lives letters  and characters published or supplements and apologies c concerning them printed  Some of the most entertaining parts of these the editor of the following  selections has endeavoured to present to the public which he hopes will be both  entertaining  and  instructive  They are taken from different publications respecting Mr HUME and LORD CHESTERFIELD or the most amusing parts of these writings thrown together in a short compass  The  life  of HUME already published makes not a part of this work but the particulars now inserted concerning Mr HUME'S death and funeral with his last will and testament cannot but prove agreeable to many readers as must the reflections which are added on  dedications  and  certain authors  Besides this a comparison at some length is made between LORD CHESTERFIELD and Mr HUME An impartial  character of the former is added with occasional observations interspersed tending to vindicate the dignity of the christian philosophy  The whole is with great deference submitted to the public for whose entertainment it was originally designed  CURIOUS  PARTICULARS c  SECTION I  THERE can be no stronger proof of the high estimation in which Mr Hume was held and of his being considered as an extraordinary character than the eager yet perhaps idle curiosity which the public entertained to learn the most minute circumstances respecting his exit  Mr Hume's natural temper disposed him to feel with exquisite sensibility every thing which affected his literary fame and notwithstanding his boasted equanimity philosophy did not shield him from the excessive chagrin which he felt from those arrows which Envy and Prejudice darted at his reputation Anxiety  relative to his difference with the whimsical Rousseau extracted from him a personal but complete justification The illiberal criticisms which Mr Gray  Perhaps the mercenary Mason is more deserving of this censure than Mr Gray In order to swell his volume and to fill his pockets the former has published a loose and desultory Correspondence which the latter never dreamt would see the light and would have reprobated could he ever have conceived the idea of his worst papers being put to this ungenerous and ungrateful use Nevertheless in return to a benefactor who conferred essential favours upon him Mr Mason has as far as he was able sacrificed his patron's reputation at the sordid altar of Plutus The posthumous Poetical Pieces of Mr Gray though infinitely valuable are few in number and were not likely to answer the interested purposes of the hungry Editor by much emolument This gentleman therefore resolving to establish a literary property or estate by the name and writings of another which he honestly acquaint's us he was unable to perform by his own has given to the world with little labour a large but meagre Quarto containing some puerile letters superior however to the Editor's notes with which they are garnished And by entitling these "The Poems of Mr Gray" led the public to buy up a large impression before the deception was discovered Thus has the ingenious Mason bartered the high poetical and literary reputation of of a worthy man who confided in him for  money  Quid non mortalia pectora coges  Aun sacra fames  threw out against him in his Epistolary Correspondence gave him much concern He saw with mortification the laurel wreath which Oxford weaved to cover the bald reputation of Beattie  his antagonist not his rival  And such was the antipathy that subsisted between him and Mr Tytler  the author of the Vindication of Mary Queen of Scots that not satisfied with a most acrimonious note  This note deserves a place as it will show that even Mr Hume himself could occasionally be guilty of  the illiberal arrogance petulance and scurrility which distinguish the Warburtonian School  But there is a person that has writ an  Enquiry historical and critical into the evidence against Mary Queen of Scots  and has attempted to refute the foregoing narrative He quotes a single passage of the nanative in which Mary is said simply to refuse answering and then a single passage from Goodall in which she boasts simply that she will answer and he very civilly and almost directly calls the author a liar on account of this pretended contradiction That whole Enquiry from beginning to end is composed of such  scandalous artifices  And from this instance the reader may judge of the  candour fair dealing veracity  and  good manners  of the Enquirer there are indeed three events in our history which may be regarded as touchstones of partymen An English Whig who asserts the reality of the popish Plot an Irish Catholic who denies the massacre in and a Scotch Jacobite who maintains the innocence of Queen Mary must be considered as men beyond the reach of argument or reason and must be left to their prejudices  which he has published in the last edition of his History he would not even sit in company with him and the appearance of the one effected the instantaneous withdrawing of the other  Mr Hume in the History of his Life has not informed us of his having stood candidate for the Professorship of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh of the opposition which the Scots clergy excited to his pretensions  nor of the enquiry which was moved for in the venerable assembly of the Church of Scotland respecting the principles inculcated in his writings and of the censures proposed to be inflicted on him as the author of Heretical Doctrines  He has observed in the nineteenth page of his Life that his History of Great Britain met at first with an indifferent reception But with respect to this Mr Hume himself was mistaken The first edition of the History of Great Britain for the reigns of James the First and Charles the First was printed at Edinburgh A D for  Hamilton Balfour and Neil  Hamilton upon his expectations from this book took a shop and settled in London He applied to the London booksellers to take copies of the History from him but none of them would deal with an  interloper  Hamilton sadly distressed has recourse to  his friend  Mr Millar Millar  obliges him  by taking fifty copies but when gentlemen in his wellfrequented shop asked for the book  Pho says Millar generously it is incomplete another volume is coming out soon You are welcome to the use of this in the mean time  Thus did Millar circulate the fifty copies among some hundred readers without selling one  And by this ingenious device attained his favourite purpose of getting Hamilton to sell him his right in the copy for a trifle as being an insignificant performance  Mr Hume and the late Reverend Dr Jardine one of the ministers of Edinburgh lived in habits of much intimacy Religion  natural  and  revealed  was frequently the subject of their conversation It happened one night after they had entertained themselves with theological controversy that Mr Hume's politeness when bidding adieu would not permit Dr Jardine whose oeconomy was not incumbered with many domesticks to light him down stairs Mr Hume stumbled in the dark and the Doctor hearing it ran to his assistance with a candle and when he had recovered his guest said to him  David I have often told you not to rely too much upon yourself and that  natural light  is not  sufficient  This pleasantry Mr Hume never relished  As a proof of the steadiness of Mr Hume's sceptical tenets it may be observed that when he published the first volume of his History of Great Britain he was advised that the opinions he had delivered concerning matters of religion would hurt the sale of his work and  that some apology would be proper He accordingly in his second volume p when speaking of the religious parties subjoins the following note which when his fame was established beyond the reach of party he cancelled as unworthy of admission  This sophism of arguing from the abuse of any thing against the use of it is one of the grossest and at the same time the most common to which men are subject The history all ages and none more than that of the period which is our subject offers us examples of the abuse of religion and we have not been sparing in this volume more than in the former to remark them But whoever would thence draw an inference to the disadvantage of religion in general would argue very rashly and erroneously The proper office of religion is to reform mens lives to purify their hearts to inforce all moral duties and to secure obedience to the laws and civil magistrate While it pursues these salutary purposes its operations tho' infinitely valuable are secret and silent and seldom come under the cognizance of history That adulterate species of it alone which inflames faction animates sedition and prompts rebellion distinguishes itself  on the open theatre of the world and is the great source of revolutions and public convulsions The historian therefore has scarce occasion to mention any other kind of religion and he may retain the highest regard for true piety even while he exposes all the abuses of the false He may even think that he cannot better show his attachment to the former than by detecting the latter and laying open its absurdities and pernicious tendency  It is no proof of irreligion in an historian that he remarks some fault or imperfection in each sect of religion which he has occasion to mention Every institution however divine which is adopted by men must partake of the weakness and infirmities of our nature and will be apt unless carefully guarded to degenerate into one extreme or the other What species of devotion so pure noble and worthy the Supreme Being as that which is most spiritual simple unadorned and which partakes nothing either of the senses or imagination Yet it is found by experience that this mode of worship does very naturally among the vulgar mount up into extravagance and fanaticism Even many of the first  reformers are exposed to this reproach and their zeal though in the event it proved extremely useful partook strongly of the enthusiastic genius Two of the judges in the reign of Charles the Second scrupled not to advance this opinion even from the bench Some mixture of ceremony pomp and ornament may seem to correct the abuse yet will it be found very difficult to prevent such a form of religion from sinking sometimes into superstition The church of England itself which is perhaps the best medium among these extremes will be allowed at least during the age of archbishop Laud to have been somewhat infected with a superstition resembling the Popish and to have payed a higher regard to some positive institutions than the nature of the things strictly speaking would permit It is the business of an historian to remark these abuses of all kinds but it belongs also to a prudent reader to confine the representations which he meets with to that age alone of which the author treats What absurdity for instance to suppose that the Presbyterians Independants Anabaptists and other sectaries of the present age partake of all the extravagancies which we remark in those who bore these appellations in the  last century The inference indeed seems juster where sects have been noted for fanaticism during one period to conclude that they will be very moderate and reasonable in the subsequent For as the nature of fanaticism during one period is to abolish all slavish submission to priestly power it follows that as soon as the first serment is abated men are naturally in such sects left to the free use of their reason and shake off the fetters of custom and authority  To say barely that Mr Hume in his moral character was unexceptionable would be doing him injustice he was truly amiable gentle hospitable and humane His temper was cast in the happiest mould if we may not except to his anxious and extreme sensibility in every thing which affected his literary reputation It is told that an elderly woman in the suburbs of Edinburgh whose excess of zeal was proportionable to her want of sense and discretion called on Mr Hume declaimed violently against his sceptical principles as she had  learned them by report represented that he was nodding on the brink of everlasting destruction and delivered an earnest prayer that it would please divine grace to give him to  see  the error of his ways Mr Hume listened to her with attention and good humour thanked the lady for her concern about his future welfare and expressed a desire to know what was her line in life She informed him that she was a married woman and that her husband was a tallowchandler in the neighbourhood upon which Mr Hume replied  Good woman since you have expressed so earnest a desire that I should be inspired with  inward light  I beg you will supply me with  outward light  also  The matron retired not a little satisfied with the commission which he gave her and her husband thenceforwards supplied Mr Hume's family with candles  Notwithstanding the ideas which zealots may have formed of Mr Hume's principles as latitudinarian as atheistical as damnable his brother's notions of them were very different For speaking of the Historian one day he expressed himself in this manner  My brother Davie is a good enough sort of a man  but rather narrow minded  As to Mr Hume's abilities as a Philosopher and an Historian his Works are the basis on which posterity will rear his everlasting fame  A few months before his death Mr Hume was persuaded by his friends to try the effects of a long journey and the Bath waters but finding his malady to increase he resigned all hopes of life He maintained however his usual chearfulness and being resolved to make the most of the short remainder of his lease he wrote to his friends in Edinburgh informing them of his resolution to be in that city by a certain day which he named and separately requested their company to dinner on the day following Accordingly Lord Elibank Professor Ferguson Mr Home the Dramatic Poet Dr Smith Dr Blair Dr Black and others of his literary friends obeyed the summons and took a sort of farewel dinner with their dying friend His  flowery  rival in historic fame was also invited But alas the Lord Advocate of Scotland invites this  Reverend Doctor  on that very day to a turtle feast What was to be done both invitations could not be embracedthe contest was short For as it would seem this  Historian's taste is almost as elegant in eating as in writing he judiciously preferred the  turtle  of my Lord Advocate to the  mutton  of David Hume  Never did death make more regular and visible approaches than to Mr Hume He met these with a chearfulness and resignation which could only be the result of a vigorous understanding and a wellspent life He still went abroad called upon his friends but as the fatigue of a chaise was now become intolerable he went in a sedan chair and his ghastly looks bore the most striking appearances of speedy death His situation was the more uncomfortable that in his weak emaciated state the physicians prescribed to him instead of a down bed to lie on a rugged pallet  His disease was a diarrheea the physicians were divided about the s  t of the malady There is reason however to conjecture that his disorder originated from a course of eating rather fully without drinking in proportion    He had already settled his affairs and his facetiousness still suggested to him to make some verbal legacies which would not have been so suitable to the gravity of a solemn deed His friend Mr Home the Poet affected  a delicacy which abhorred even the taste of Port wine this whimsical nicety had often been the subject of Mr Hume's raillery and he left verbally to his friend the poet  one bottle  of Port and ten dozen of Claret but on this condition that the poet should drink the Port at two sittings before he tasted the Claret  Such was the estimation in which Mr Hume was held from his amiable qualities as a citizen as well as from his literary fame that for some weeks before his death his situation became the universal topick of conversation and enquiry each individual expressing an anxious solicitude about his health as if he had been his intimate and particular friend  On the twentyfifth of August Mr Hume's character was put beyond the reach of being sullied by human frailty  Mr Hume after his circumstances became affluent lived very hospitably and genteely Yet he left to his relations upwards of l of his own acquiring He had a pension from government of l per annum  As soon as he conceived himself to be in a dying way he purchased a spot for the depositing of his  ashes the southwest corner of the Caston buryingground at Edinburgh  a rock wherein never man had been laid  And from the particular charge he gave about his corpse it would seem he was not altogether devoid of apprehensions of its being treated with insult  The anxious attention with which the public viewed every circumstance respecting Mr Hume's illness was not terminated even by his death From the busy curiosity of the mob one would have presumed them to entertain notions that the ashes of Mr Hume were to have been the cause or the object of miraculous exertion As the physicians of London and Edinburgh were divided about the seat of his disorder those of the city where he died proposed that his body should be opened but this his brother who was also his executor agreeably to the orders of the deceased would not permit  It is hardly to be credited that the gravediggers digging with pickaxes Mr Hume's grave should have attracted the gaping curiosity of the multitude That notwithstanding  a heavy rain which fell during the interment multitudes of all ranks gazed at the funeral procession  When the mob were assembled round Mr Hume's door to see the corpse taken out to interment the following short dialogue passed between two of the refuse of the rabble  Ah says one he was an Atheist  No matter says another he was an  honest man  as if they had expected the hearse to have been consumed in livid flames or encircled with a ray of glory that people in a sphere much above the rabble would have sent to the sexton for the keys of the buryingground and paid him to have access to visit the grave And that on a Sunday evening the gates of the buryingground being opened for another funeral the company from a public walk in the neighbourhood flocked in such crouds to Mr Hume's grave that his brother actually became apprehensive upon the unusual concourse and ordered the grave to be railed in with all expedition  After his interment two trusty persons watched the grave for about eight nights The watch was set by eight at night at which time a pistol was fired and so continued to be every hour till daylight Candles in a  lanthorn were placed upon the grave where they burned all night and the grease which dropped in renewing or snuffing the candles was to be seen upon the grave afterwards  CERTIFIED COPY

DAVID HUME  ON DEDICATIONS  SECTION II On DEDICATIONS  THE above particulars will have shewn to readers the  man  and the  philosopher  as well as the highest respect that was paid to eminent  virtue and abilities  even by those in the lower classes who had differed so widely from Mr Hume in  religious  and  political opinions  or who continued to  reprobate  his  principles  But let us next proceed to the apology for the life and writings of our philosopher and see the reasons for his not having dedicated his works to any great men  To confess the truth he wrote generally upon subjects of which the modern nobility are for the most part so contemptibly ignorant that to have inscribed performances so scientific to such patrons would involve the Philosopher in a similar error of judgment Indeed nothing is more offensive to men of true taste and right feeling than the  c  descension  of persons of genius to persons of  merely as such This it is more than any thing else that hath helped to degrade the literary character which as it implies a superior vigour of intellect and a more enlarged capacity possesses naturally an unrivalled dignity According to all the systems of all the sects it is allowed that the human understanding is the greatest as it is the most boasted distinction of  human beings  consequently one of these beings must rise higher than another in the scale of rationality only by so much as the distinguishing part of him is elevated above that of others So likewise a shallow illiterate and vacant creature must sink in the scale by the same equitable proportion Now it is easy to prove that what are called the Great who are but too commonly the least of all God's little atoms must according to the very nature of things be amongst the  worst  judges of literary merit  and therefore speaking truly its most improper patrons Men born to titles and to fortunes which descend without effort or exertion of any talent whatever imagine the cultivation of the mind totally adventitious nor does the man of fashion admit it into the catalogue of his accomplishments Even the harlequin Lord Chesterfieldthat successful smattererallows only such a share of philosophy as belongs to the philosophy of the passions which is nothing more in his idea than guarding  yourself  while you make a fine dextrous and successful push at the passions of  another  Giddiness glitter the indolence of plenty and above all its impudence all contribute to render persons of rank frivolous voluble superficial the illustrious exceptions of a Bacon a Bolingbroke a Shaftesbury a Lyttleton a Prussia a Clarendon have nothing to do with a rule so deplorably general  This being the case can any thing be so preposterous as to inscribe to the mere tinsel of titles the labours of learning or the reflections of accurate and abstruse Philosophy Yet hath this been for many ages the practice Whence hath it happened  The question cannot be answered without affecting us  Fortune seems to have neglected those whom Nature hath most favoured and  men of genius  I suppose think it but fair to supply the defect by soliciting  men of money  This solicitation however subjects them to all that rudeness and disdain which those who have only a handful of authority bestow upon their flatterers The flatterers are in turn well served they set out upon a wrong principleThe intercourse is altogether ill managed Dedications being another source of our  national Hypocrisy  deserve a more correct investigation It has been just observed that they are fundamentally false  A dedication admits of two distinct definitions of which one belongs to the Patron and one to the Author The Patron not only receives every untruth that can be expressed in the pride of Panegyric as his due but believes at the same time that he receives it from an unprovided being who is to exist for a certain space of time upon the success of his encomium Something therefore is usually sent to keepfor I would  adopt the great man's language"the poor devil of an Author from starving" The Author's definition is on the other hand so servile as to deduct from every sentiment of pity and make us confess the justice of his disgraceHe is contented to lavish praises of which the best man on earth might blush to be the object and he expects a golden reward proportionate to the violent colourings of the varnish and to the fainter or fuller blaze of the "lye courteous" Which conduct shall we most reprobate They are equally contemptible The traffic should be regulated more consistently If men of genius must needs address their works to men of rank let them assert a more noble equality If they draw the portraits of any person remarkable for any thing let not a writer think he is more honoured than he honours if he emblazons a name which was before glimmering in obscurity the obligation is to all intents and purposes on the side of the Patron who but for such imputed excellence would have passed unobserved through life if he faithfully displays a character already much celebrated he is still a benefactor to that character if it were only for jogging the elbow of the public which but for  such occasional mementos would soon forget the best and brightest man in the world  Seriously were literary persons to act upon some such principle as this and shew their Patrons that the dealing was in point both of praise and profit entirely on the square it would check much of that assurance which is now indulged on the supposition that writers are to offer incense at the shrine of greatness orin words more worthy so grovling a subject to making the faggot blaze to gratify folly and then to be paid for burning the fingers as the pittance is dispensed by a taskmaster Of much more service indeed would it be to genius science and general learning if their votaries were more inclined to cherish a spirit of intellectual independency if instead of cringing to a courtier or running from the most fordid motives into panegyrical hyperbole they were to assert their dignity and shew the superior lustre of talents to the dullness of titles I say if a spirit of this kind were aroused it would soon restore to men of genius the original rights of literature at the same time that it would effectually crush that daring insolence which is now common among a set of people who  pique themselves upon advantages which were the proper levelling power maintained would of itself by no means entitle them to equal honours  Instead of this spirited conduct however we have the misfortune to perceive a style of baseness and adulation creep through most of the epistles dedicatory for the space of several centuries by which means flattery and fulsomeness is associated with the very idea of those addresses and the literary character is held by the dullest of the species in utter contempt  What hath undoubtedly contributed to bring about so disgraceful a circumstance is a custom which prevails amongst authors of swelling the ignorant vanity of Patrons by submitting to them a performance prior to its entry into the public world this mode might indeed be reasonable enough were it only designed as a compliment to the taste of the Patron which the Authors may be supposed anxious to gratify before the matter becomes as it were public property but when it is done with a view of begging permission to say civil things of the Patron and his family it degenerates  into a meanness which justly merits the neglect that commonly attends it  Ask permission for what For distinguishing a man For circulating the knowledge of his good qualities beyond the narrow circle of very likely a frivilous set of companions Require  leave  to do this Was there ever heard such an inconsistencyThe point is misconceived Be it again remarked that in true science there is a greatness which can seldom  receive  though it may often  confer  obligations Genius may more properly be said to patronize than be patronized  If a production is fit for the eye of men of taste it ought to be acceptable to men of rank who are ready enough to be thought in possession of a fine taste themselves and very frequently no doubt pay liberally for their dedications solely upon that principle  If on the other hand a performance is crude trifling illwritten and notwithstanding such defects is without the consent of the Patron adorned with a name which it disgraces such Patron ought publicly to renounce  his protection and treat the pretender as every pretender of whatever profession deserves to be treated still however with this salvo that if the production could have done any service to literature or promoted but in a small degree the cause of science he would have been the first man to acknowledge  his obligations  for having been thought a fit patron to assist that cause and strengthen those servicesWhile the present scandalous concessions remain the sneer will inevitably be thrown upon such abominable prostration I have been somewhat copious on this subject because it has never to my recollection been placed in a proper light  Perhaps this doctrine of dedications may be little relished by those who are daily pampered into conceit by daily panegyric but it is a justice which every man of letters owes to a character founded on qualities which ought to be a better passport to honorary distinctions than any that can be conferred by royal grant or by the pride of ancestry  On such qualities was sounded the reputation of David Hume so that upon  this  occasion  at least his example may be held up to the persons engaged in literary pursuits as a proper standard  It would seem from these ingenious remarks on dedicators that authors should maintain dignity of character and not prostitute themselves by addressing either folly or stupidity in high stations but if they dedicate at all to address the  wise  and  good only  This would undoubtedly greatly lessen the number of dedications and  Dedicatees  might be held up to view from the middling or lower ranks which would exhibit new  phoenomena  in the literary region But alas this tho' a debt due to superior merit is not to be expected for there would seldom be  patronage  or emoluments in the case  Certainly in this insinuating kind of business all  daubing flattery  or  bombast  should be laid aside as what may be termed  "coarse plaistering work"  has brought addresses of this sort into contempt A  production  of  genius  requires not patronage  That  marked by the  uninteresting  the  dull  or  insipid  will not be pushed into public esteem by any  patron  or  dedication  whatsoever  The names of several sensible and even eminent writers have not a little been disgraced by  fulsome dedications  Dryden Colley Cibber Mrs Centlivre Lee Otway and others witness to the truth of this as do some of our modern miscellanies novels plays adventures c not forgetting the author of  liberal opinions  But it is hoped that with the increase of science a general reform in this abuse will take place  Literary parasites  in an  age  of  light  and  knowledge should neither be seen felt heard or understood  A PARALLEL BETWIXT DAVID HUME and LORD CHESTERFIELD  SECTION III A PARALLEL betwixt DAVID HUME and LORD CHESTERFIELD both with respect to  Abilities  and  Principles  LET me now says the author of the Apology c draw a slight parallel betwixt this gentleman and another celebrated writer who descended into the tomb a little before him I would persuade the reader to compare with me the system of David Hume and that of the late Earl of Chesterfield Not with a view of proposing the former to his imitationfor that point should always be settled by a man's own mind after a great deal of premeditation upon the matterbut as it may serve to shew what hath indeed been a principal endeavour in these pages that it is possible even for sceptics to be more worthy members  of society more reverend to a first cause whatever it may be and more essentially the friend of mankind than the most illustrious persons who have never ventured so far into the recesses of enquiry Lord Chesterfield was a character more distinguished for the brilliancy of his wit than the solider powers of his understandingIn points of philosophy he was exceedingly superficial in politics he did not want sagacity or experience Assisted however very much by the splendours of his titlefor a little spark will make a large lustre in a Lordhe sustained his character with singular eclat and passed in the world which is very easily dazzled as a compound of elegance humour  morality  gaiety and patronageThese qualities in a certain degree we allow him to have possessed except one it certainly is not now necessary to observe that it is the word  morality  which must be scratched out of this list For many years however Lord Chesterfield's  morals  were unsuspected at length too superficial to be consistent or perhaps weary of deceiving the world into notions of his plain dealing he condescended in the eve of life to shew mankind what a bubble he had mad of it how long and how successful he had sported upon its weaknesseswith how much ease he had  played the elegant trifler and by what modes and manoeuvres he had with a facility which required no effort but a smooth face and pliable features led in victorious chains a thousand fools to the altars either of ridicule or debauchery or destruction  Such were the principles such is the system of this  distinguished hypocrite  by the adoption of whose precepts it is utterly impossible either for youth or age with or wisdom to escape every thing that is execrable contemptible and delusive The atheistical Hume as some have called him was in comparison with Chesterfield deserving of every epithet that could be formed in language to express virtue In his life writing and at his death he seems to have abhorred  dissimulation  and yet his company "was not unacceptible to the young and careless as well as to the studious and literary" nor had he "any reason to complain of the reception he met from  modest  women in whose company he was particularly delighted" He did not nevertheless profess a fondness for the society of  modest  women because it was  safer  to have an affair of gallantry with such than with a prostitute professed or because the connection was more elevated and consistent with the amours of a  gentleman nor did he mix with the gay and careless with any latent design to take an advantage of the chearful hour in order to make himself master of the secrets of the heart imparted in its fullnessand consequently master of the person to whom that entrapped heart had the misfortune to belong By no means Whatever objections may lie against the philosophy of Hume none of them are of this nature since his most abstract researches were in favour of a behaviour perfectly irreproachable  Whoever is acquainted with Mr Hume's writings will bear witness that he was a lover of decency order and decorum Whoever knew the man can attest that the following passages are no wise exaggerated  "I  am  " says he "or rather  was  for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments I was I say a man of mild dispositions of command of temper of an open social and cheerful humour capable of attachment but little susceptible of enmity and of great moderation in all my passions Even my love of literary fame my ruling passion never soured my temper notwithstanding  my frequent disappointments My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless as well as to the studious and literary and as I took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women I had no reason to be displeased with the reception I met with from them In a word though most men any wise eminent have found reason to complain of calumny I never was touched or even attacked by her baleful tooth and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct not but that the zealots we may well suppose would have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my disadvantage but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself but I hope it is not a misplaced one and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained"  To a character so amiable so complacent and so little tinctured by that pedantry which always sticks to an affected philosopher  who  that hath any sense of agreeable qualities will  ever bring near him such a frivolous compound of whim wickedness cunning and congee as Lord Chesterfield unless indeed he is brought forward by way of contrast There appears likewise to me to have been as wide a difference in the size of their abilities as there was in the honesty of their principles every page in those Letters which have laid open his Lordship's hypocrisy furnishes us with examples of his futility it would be the drudgery of a day to detect a single light sentence in Hume The Earl of Chesterfield's utmost stretch of penetration amounts to little more than shrewdness partly caught from the suggestions of a mind naturally suspicious and partly from observations upon the weaknesses and tender imperfections of men less capable to dissemble This faculty is at best but a principal ingredient in the character of a  cunning  fellow who as it were by imperceptible slight of hand hath the art of appearing what he is not and of cheating you with singular dexterity even before your face  But all the fame or popular etiquette that could possibly arise from such practices Hume would have discarded with disdain And chiefly for two reasons first his genius had not a single grain of the petit maitre in it  which by the way was a considerable ingredient in Lord Chesterfield's and secondly he had too much dignity in his nature and too just a sense of the social compact between the individual and the whole human race to find any zest in gratifications which emanated from neither more nor less flagrant treachery Hence it appears obvious enough that the Earl of Chesterfield's heart and head were both unable to bear any sort of parallel with the head and heart of David Hume The one is the Author of a system which seems to have been pillaged from the Dancingmaster the Perfumer and the Devil the other pursues a philosophy which with all its exceptions gives countenance neither to the follies of a coxcomb nor the meanness and mischief of a hypocritea wretch which in the course of these pages hath been marked with singular reprobation and above all other hypocrites one that in a kind of moral masquerade dress perpetrates every baseness and passes upon the world as a  mighty good Christian creature  SECTION IV  THE public will judge of the  propriety  and  impartiality  of the foregoing comparison Lord Chesterfield never pretended to be a moral philosopher how far then comparing men of such opposite principles tastes and tempers was proper is left to the sensible reader But as unfavourable ideas of our  noble author  may be formed from the above as well as from some late strictures on what is termed "the loose part of his letters to his son" I cannot in justice to his character but give the following just observation made upon it  The  mental abilities  of Lord Chesterfield have never been brought into question for  all have allowed the keenness of his wit and the soundness of his understanding but many on the evidence of a single fact have condemned his principles as unfavourable to the true interests of religion honour and virtue His morals have been excerated purely on the ground of accusation afforded by some of those private letters to Mr Stanhope which ought not to have been made public Had these never seen the light his Lordship's same had perhaps never suffered any impeachment and his memory might have been transmitted to posterity with that applause and admiration which we see paid to the Montagues the Boyles the Sackvilles the Sheffields and the Granvill  s who now repose on their laurels unmolested by the fangs of envy or the shafts of the censorious  In public stations particularly in Ireland Lord Chesterfield's conduct ever met with deserved plau  ts in private life his brilliant wit his exquisite humour and his invariable p  teness rendered him the constant delight of his friendsand in the tender domestic relations he was not only irreproachable but exemplary In fine a more amiable man  scarce ever graced a court or adorned the peaceful scenes of retirement  With respect to that exceptionable part of his conducthis failure as a preceptor little can be said in his defence but let that little be heard  A father so desirous that his son should answer in every respect the model of perfection he had sketched out to himself must have been much mortified on finding himself frustrated in his unwearied endeavours to polish and refine his mannersThe fertility of his genius in expedients to inspire Mr Stanhope with the  desire of pleasing  is not any where more conspicuous than in this part of his letters  We allude to those written when the young gentleman was arrived at the age of nineteen a time of life when the utmost exertions of good breeding would be expected  Finding the disorder obstinate he had recourse to more desperate remedies as  empirics  too frequently administer poison in their vain attempts to subdue unconquerable maladies or to cure diseases less dangerous than those which their inconsiderate practice entails upon their patients  Far be it from me to endeavour to conceal or excuse the luxuriances of a warm imagination Vice can at no time and under no pretence become any part of a rational education nor would it be sufficient to say that the manners of great cities especially Paris have in some degree  authorized polite gallantry  In vain also would it be urged that Lord Chesterfield knowing perhaps by his own experience with how much difficulty certain passions are resisted in youth might have thought there was no other choice but that of  coarse debauchery  and sentimental engagements or that the latter depending sometimes on a fine address or being possessed of the graces might stimulate his pupil to excel this way  It might further be said that when mutual liberty is allowed in what is called in Paris the married state chastity can no more be expected on one side than fidelity on the other nor can the crime of corruption well be charged where general depravity prevails  But we rest not the defence of Lord Chesterfield on such weak foundations Drawing a  veil therefore on this part of his conduct which was not intended and ought not to have been exposed to the public eye we must be content with deploring the weakness of human nature which hitherto never admitted of perfection  SECTION V A  Portrait  of  Lord Chesterfield  HIS character is generally well understoodIt is agreed on all hands that he was a discreet Clodiusa sober Duke of Wharton born with inferiour abilities to those which distinguish that unfortunate nobleman but with the same passion for universal admiration he was master of more prudence and discretion  He formed himself very early to make a distinguished figure in the state Impelled by his ruling passion he applied himself assiduously to studies which might render him an accomplished speaker an  able  negotiator  a counsellor in the cabinetto sum up all one equal to any civil employment There cannot be a doubt that he aimed at acquiring the office of prime minister or at least the power of appointing the person whom he approved to that postBut the superiour abilities of Walpole disappointed his ambition  His situation was flatteringWhen young he was placed about the person of  George the Second  when prince of Wales he did not reflect that those who are in the most elevated station have no idea of friendship independent of a most implicit not to say abject resignation to their will His marriage with the Duchess of Kendal's neice so far from advancing his interest at court occasioned a litigation between him and his sovereign  He understood what is called the balance of Europe or the several interests and claims of its princes perfectly This science with his polished address qualified him to be one of the ablest negociators of his time He made himself acquainted with the characters of all the great men in the several courts of Europe he knew their intriguestheir attachments  their foibles and was enabled from thence to counteract all their political machinations  I am persuaded that his being sent on his first embassy to Holland was rather an honourable exile than a mark of favour He would in all probability have been troublesome at home  Walpole  did not envy him the honour of shining among the Dutch and eclipsing a French envoy by superior adroitness  As a speaker he is justly celebrated for a certain accuracy as well as brilliancy of style for pointed wit gay humour and sportive facetiousness However his admirers must confess that he never could reach the sublime in oratoryHe frequently strove to disarm his adversaries by the most profuse commendation of their abilities but what is certainly very reprehensible in him while he bestowed unlimited commendations on the ministers whom he opposed he threw out the most stinging reflections on the prince as if he had forgotten that the servants of the crown are alone accountable for errors in government  The most applauded as well as unexceptionable part of his public character was his administration in Ireland As a Viceroy he shone with great lustre and was universally approved perhaps he was indebted to this singular good fortune for his being called to the office of secretary of state at the expiration of his first year's government of that kingdom  In private life we should naturally pronounce a Chesterfield the most satisfied of all men Easy gay polite and master of his passions what could such a man want to render his happiness complete The same passion for admiration which actuated him in public accompanied him through every walk of life  Though wondering senates hung on all he spoke  The club must hall him master of the joke  When he had reached one goal he planned for anotherHe aimed at universality of character He wished to be destined the patron of learned men but wanted generosity of soul to merit that title  He espoused and patronized a great genius of the age who addressed an admirable  plan  of his  Dictionary  to him but the capriciousness and instability of his mind prevented his gaining that honour he most ardently wished fora dedication of the work itselfA Letter written to him on that memorable occasion by the author who despised his meanness and disdained to gratify his vanity will live for ever in the memory of those who have been favoured with the recital of it  It is impossible to reconcile to any principles of  reason and morality  the shocking advice which he gave his son viz "to treat all women alike and to suppose them all equally liable to seduction"Was then his Lordship so successful a loverWas his address so formidable that no lady could resist himHis Lordship I am afraid was not wholly free from affectationGreat wits and men who court applause from all the world are not generally the most passionate lovers  Prior  's Chloe was a poetical and ideal character  Poor Pope  was immoderately and ostentatiously  fond of Patty Blount  Swift  after having admired and courted the celebrated Stella near twenty years married her and was afterwards never in her company but when a third person was present  I would not insinuate that his Lordship was so cold a lover as Swift nor do I imagine him to be the libertine he wishes to pass forLike Lord Foppington in the play he might think the  reputation  of an  amour  with a fine woman the most delicious part of the business I never heard of any of his Lordship's successful gallantries except that which brought Mr Stanhope into the world His contempt of the sex might possibly arife from their dislike and aversion to him  Thus have I given the character drawn of Lord Chesterfield in which are  excellencies beauties defects  and  blemishes  In Ireland they experienced at a most critical conjuncture his Lordship's  wisdom moderation  and  disinterestedness  when in the plenitude of powerThat he was possessed of  great athilities  and  eminent merit  in many respects  cannot be controvertedThis just remark is a  free will offering  paid to  departed worth  or an assemblage of amiable agreeable qualities joined to the most shining accomplishments  SECTION VI The CONCLUSION  THE above  selections  and  occasional observations  will it is hoped be favourably received The editor has endeavoured to present to the public a pleasing and profitable entertainment in a small compass considering the variety or number of important particulars introduced Whatever relates to such distinguished characters as Lord Chesterfield and Mr Hume cannot but claim attention from persons of  taste and a laudable curiosity  After what has been said by  Hume's  advocates particularly by the  apologist  for his life and writings it were wrong not to remark on some sentiments that have been thrown out with an  air  of  triumph  by that writer  He says "perhaps it is one of the very worst circumstances against the  cause  of  christianity  that very few of its professors were ever either so moral so humane or could so philosophically govern their passions as the sceptical David Hume  It is admitted that the lives of too many who think themselves christians are vicious and immoral a disgrace to their profession a reproach to humanity I will also admit Mr Hume to have had a virtuous philosophic mind  But surely christianity ought not to be blamed for the profligacy of its professors It were as unjust to declaim against the  beauty  and  excellence  of our  civil constitution  because it hath been so frequently  violated  by the  venal  and the  wicked  Christianity gives not shelter to any sin but on the contrary hath set the precepts and example of its divine founder against all iniquityas well as the pains of the world to comeIf its votaries are not  pure selfdenied meek humble pious  and  benevolent  it is not the fault of their religion because for sublimity of precepts and doctrines unadulterated christianity will ever stand unrivalled  But that very few of its professors "were ever either so  moral  so  humane  or could so  philosophically  govern their passions as Mr Hume" I denyTho'  clerical characters  may probably appear most exceptionable to the author of this unjust remark yet the very respectable names of  Leighton Barrow Whichcot Tillotson Cudworth Burnet Clarke Hoadley Butler Middleton Clayton Berkley Young Sherlock SeckerFoster Chandler Duchal Abernethly Watts Leland  and others that might be named fully evince the contrary Several of these were remarkable for  self government  for an  equanimity  of  temper effected  by  moral discipline  all of them were men of abilities and distinguished by eminent virtue Nor is there one of them whose life was not as pure and perhaps more  useful  than Mr  Hume  's  But our catalogue of  christian worthies  need not be confined to the  clerical order  The lift of  statesmen patriots  and  philosophers  that have adorned our annals likewise contradict so vague an assertion When we speak of Sir  Matthew Hale  Sir  Thomas More  of  Milton Sydney Locke Newton Boyle Addison Hutcheson  with certain cotemporaries of the two last and  Lord Lyttleton  we shall see in  some of these that both Mr  Hume  's  virtues  and  abilities  more than equalled  The LATTER END of most of the names abovementioned was so peaceful so full of hope so nobly supported by a  consciousness  to  past rectitude  of life and at the same time marked by such sublime sentimentsthat when we  contrast their last scene  to Mr Hume's not having an  excuse  to give  Charon  which indeed shewed much serenity of mind a great superiority appears The entertainment derived from  Lucian's Dialogues  of the  Dead  was but cold and insipid at such an hour compared to the elevated strains of devotion which fell from those who did honour to the christian name  It were indelicate to speak of living characters or numbers would swell the recital as  moral  and  humane  as Mr Hume But if we look back to the  first reformers  or days of  persecution  when  truth  stood in need of support from its votariesshould we bring into this account those christian heroes and martyrs who animated by virtuous resolution suffered and bled in the noblest of all causesa glorious cloud of witnesses in our favour would appear  The magnimity and greatness of mind that distinguished many of these when persecuted and put to death for righteousness sake cannot but command our admirationI shall not say whether Mr Hume would have shewn as much firmness in defence of his most favourite tenets but he has I believe never made any  expensive sacrifices on the altar  of  truth and liberty  consequently not to be set in competition with  tried triumphant integrity  The  calm retreats  of  philosophic ease  call not forth the  heroic virtues  In such retirements sometimes devoted to sceptical disquisitions temptations to defection have been comparatively but few nor can individuals of this sort much boast of having exhibited to the world many instances of persevering fortitude under persecuting trials or of having met the  King  of  Terrors  in his most awful appearances with that  generous contempt  or  surprising resolution  which marked the exits of many christian martyrs even at the  stake  or when the  flames  had laid hold on them  However moral and humane Mr Hume may have been his merit is not controverted yet his admirers ought not to celebrate his virtue  at the  expence  of the christian character which we have seen is elevated or as if good  morals  and  deism  had before been strangers Such triumph on account of goodness and humanity in a  sceptical individual  would seem to mark a deficiency in eminent worth among those of that cast  Be this as it may certain it is that Mr Hume's propositions respecting CAUSE and EFFECT would if pursued in their consequences terminate nearly in atheism This hath been the opinion of wise and good men It is needless to say how such tenets tend to  loosen moral obligation  consequently to destroy the most  essential interests  of societyIt is therefore with caution that the young and unthinking should hear men of such principles praised or set above those eminent professors of christianity to which honour I trust it now appears they have not a just claim  Licentiousness  in  principle  has generally lead to  libertinsm  in practice and I will assert "that the man who is bound by the  awful sanctions  of  religion  may be most depended on" he bids fairest for being the honest trader the good neighbour and citizen the sincere friend and  steadfast lover of his country or for discharging in a becoming manner all the duties of civil and social life Nay I know not whether it would be a breach of charity to say "that  doubters  or  unbelievers  have seldombeen eminent for  purity of manners disinterested beneficence  exalted piety or for true magnanimity mind  It is not to persons of this description that truth and liberty the civil and religious rights of mankind arts sciences and philosophy the peace and happiness of mens minds or their advancement in useful knowledge substantial piety and generous virtue stand eminently indebted  On the contrary many of them have been the most  superficial bigotted  and  narrow minded  of  mortalscovetous profligate impious  under a pretence of greater freedom of thought than others they have been known to take liberties inconsistent with  decency and good manners  or have openly attempted by the  coarsest buffoonery  to throw the most venerable things into contempt It were unnecessary to add that  calmness  and  true fortitude  of spirit are not likely to be the death bed attendants on such men  These particulars will it is hoped shew the  futility  as well as falsehood of the assertion we have been controverting viz "That perhaps it is one of the very worst circumstances against the cause of christianity that very few of its professors were ever either so moral so humane or could so philosophically govern their passions as the sceptical David Hume"A proposition which if true would not a little derogate from the dignity and importance of the christian cause and character  But surely we need not rest our  moral defence  entirely on the lives of eminent divines philosophers c as before namedHave we not seen in common life numerous instances of  true greatness  and  heroism  a contempt of the world and discipline of the passions inspired by christianity Hath not this divine philosophy made the naturally  wrathful  and  proudmeek  and  humble  the avaricious generous the intemperate sober the profane and profligate pure and pious  I cannot resist concluding these remarks in the words of a justly admired writer "To see a person says he of no more than common understanding a stranger to all science  in religious matters but what is derived from the holy scriptures by virtue of this discipline only acting his part in life so as with happy success to serve the great purposes of it to see him maintaining an amiable purity of manners and decency of behaviour abounding in the just and natural expressions of devotion towards God in the fruits of righteousness and charity towards mankind to see him studiously endeavouring to adorn every station in life by the practice of those virtues which are suited to it making it his first care to approve himself to God and his own conscience resolved and firm in resisting temptations to evil and in maintaining his integrity at any expence labouring daily to correct what is amiss in his temper despising all sensual pleasures and temporal possessions when compared with virtue and religion with the favour of his Maker and the hope of an happy immortality"  To see a person so formed going through life most reputably and usefully appearing uniform and like himself in all the changes of itto see him at  last meet death  with undisturbed tranquillity of spiritpossibly with desire and joy must one would think in an  attentive observer beget very  favourable sentiments  concerning  a religion  by means of which all these virtues are carried to so eminent a degreeOne would indeed wonder if any good man should be an adversary to it  ☜ After this pamphlet had been written the Editorto his surprize found that the author of the Apology for the life and writings of David Hume who hath thrown out such unmerited false accusations against the advocates for christianity is no other than Courtney Melmoth  Esq  author also of a book lately published entitled "The  Sublime and Beautiful of Scripture  "in which he says "I shall account myself singularly fortunate if such endeavours have in any degree done a service to compositions which are so able to support the trial"  The inconsistency and contradictions which so strongly mark the writings of this declamatory publisher in the two productions abovementioned would seem deeply to  affect  his  sincerity  or lay him open to be  taxed  with that  bypocrisy  of which he would insinuate the  friends of revealed religion  stand chargeable  This remark cannot be deemed uncandid as it immediately respects a writer who has opened a  masked battery  against his  own works  THE Editor of this Collection in order to present Readers with the greater Variety of elegant Entertainment has added the late  LORD CHESTERFIELD  's celebrated Speech against  LICENSING  the  STAGE  Likewise his ironical Petition for a Pension which is strongly marked by genuine Wit and true Humour  THE Earl of CHESTERFIELD's SPEECH AGAINST LICENSING the STAGE  MY LORDS  THE Bill now before you I apprehend to be of a very extraordinary a very dangerous nature It seems designed not only as a restraint on the licentiousness of the Stage but it will prove a most arbitrary restraint on the liberty of the Stage and I fear it looks yet farther I fear it tends towards a restraint on the liberty of the Press which will be a long stride towards the destruction of liberty itself It is not only a Bill my L  rds of a very extraordinary nature but it has been brought in at a very extraordinary season and pushed  with most extraordinary dispatch When I consider how near it was to the end of the session and how long this session had been protracted beyond the usual time of the year when I considered that this Bill passed through the other House with so much precipitancy as even to get the start of a Bill which deserved all the respect and all the dispatch the forms of either House of Parliament could admit of it set me upon enquiring what could be the reason for introducing this Bill at so unseasonable a time and pressing it forward in a manner so very singular and uncommon I have made all possible inquiry and as yet I must confess I am at a loss to find out the great occasion I have it is true learned from common report without doors that a most seditious a most heinous farce had been offered to one of the theatres a farce for which the authors ought to be punished in the most exemplary manner But what was the consequence the master of that theatre behaved as he was in duty bound and as common prudence directed He not only refused to bring it upon the Stage but carried it to a certain Honourable Gentleman in the Administration as the surest method of having it absolutely suppressed Could this be the occasion of introducing such an extraordinary  Bill at such an extraordinary season and pushing it in so extraordinary a manner Surely nothe dutiful behaviour of the player the prudent caution they shewed upon that occasion can never be a reason for subjecting them to such an arbitrary restraint It is an argument in their favour and a material one in my opinion against the Bill Nay farther if we consider all circumstances it is to me a full proof that the laws now in being are sufficient for punishing those players who shall venture to bring any seditious libel upon the Stage and consequently sufficient for deterring all players from acting any thing that may have the least tendency towards giving a reasonable offence  I do not my Lords pretend to be a lawyer I do not pretend to know perfectly the power and extent of our laws but I have conversed with those that do and by them I have been told that our laws are sufficient for punishing any person that shall dare to represent upon the Stage what may appear either by the words or the representation to be blasphemous seditious or immoral I must own indeed I have observed of late a remarkable licentiousness in the Stage There have but very lately been two plays acted which one  would have thought should have given the greatest offence and yet both were suffered to be often represented without disturbance without censure In one the author thought fit to represent the three great professions Religion Physic and the Law as inconsistent with common sense In the other a most tragical story was brought upon the stage a catastrophe too recent too melancholy and of too solemn a nature to be heard of any where but from the pulpit How these pieces came to pass unpunished I do not know If I am rightly informed it was not for want of law but for want of prosecution without which no law can be made effectual But if there was any neglect in this case I am convinced it was not with a design to prepare the minds of the people and to make them think a new law necessary  Our Stage ought certainly my Lords to be kept within bounds but for this our laws as they stand at present are sufficient If our stageplayers at any time exceed those bounds they ought to be prosecuted they may be punished We have precedents we have examples of persons having been punished for things less criminal than either of the two pieces I have mentioned A new law must  therefore be unnecessary and in the present case it cannot be unnecessary without being dangerous Every unnecessary restraint on licentiousness is a fetter upon the legs is a shackle upon the hands of liberty One of the greatest blessings we enjoy one of the greatest blessings a people my Lords can enjoy is libertybut every good in this life has its alloy of evilLicentiousness is the alloy of liberty it is an ebullition an excrescence it is a speck upon the eye of the political body which I can never touch but with a gentle with a trembling hand lest I destroy the body lest I injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear If the Stage becomes at any time licentious if a play appears to be a libel upon the government or upon any particular man the king's courts are open the laws are sufficient for punishing the offender and in this case the person injured has a singular advantage he can be under no difficulty to prove who is the publisher the players themselves are the publishers and there can be no want of evidence to convict them  But my Lords suppose it true that the laws now in being are not sufficient for putting a check to or preventing the licentiousness of the Stage suppose it absolutely necessary some  new law should be made for that purpose yet it must be granted that such a law ought to be maturely considered and every clause every sentence nay every word of it well weighed and examined lest under some of those methods presumed or pretended to be necessary for restraining licentiousness a power should lie concealed which might be afterwards made use of for giving a dangerous would to liberty Such a law ought not to be introduced at the close of a session nor ought we in the passing of such a law to depart from any of the forms prescribed by our ancestors for preventing deceit and surprize There is such a connection between licentiousness and liberty that it is not easy to correct the one without dangerously wounding the other It is extremely hard to distinguish the true limit between them like a changeable silk we can easily see there are two different colours but we cannot easily discover where the one ends or where the other beginsThere can be no great and immediate danger from the licentiousness of the stage I hope it will not be pretended that our government may before next winter be overturned by such licentiousness even though our Stage were at present under no sort of legal controul Why then may we not delay till next session passing any law  against the licentiousness of the Stage Neither our government can be altered nor our constitution overturned by such a delay but by passing a law rashly and unadvisedly our constitution may at once be destroyed and our government rendered arbitrary Can we then put a small a shortlived inconvenience in the balance with perpetual slavery Can it be supposed that a parliament of  Great Britain  will so much as risque the latter for the sake of avoiding the former  Surely my Lords this is not to be expected were the licentiousness of the stage much greater than it is were the insufficiency of our laws more obvious than can be pretended but when we complain of the licentiousness of the Stage and of the insufficiency of our laws I fear we have more reason to complain of bad measures in our polity and a general decay of virtue and morality among the people In public as well as private life the only way to prevent being ridiculed or censured is to avoid all ridiculous or wicked measures and to pursue such only as are virtuous and worthy The people never endeavour to ridicule those they love and esteem nor will they suffer them to be ridiculed If any one attempts it the ridicule  returns upon the author he makes himself only the object of public hatred and contempt The actions or behaviour of a private man may pass unobserved and consequently unapplauded uncensured but the actions of those in high stations can neither pass without notice nor without censure or applause and therefore an administration without esteem without authority among the people let their power be ever so great let their power be ever so arbitrary they will be ridiculed The severest edicts the most terrible punishments cannot entirely prevent it If any man therefore thinks he has been censured if any man thinks he has been ridiculed upon any of our public theatres let him examine his actions he will find the cause let him alter his conduct he will find a remedy As no man is perfect as no man is infallible the greatest may err the most circumspect may be guilty of some piece of ridiculous behaviour It is not licentiousness it is an useful liberty always indulged the Stage in a free country that some great men may there meet with a just reproof which none of their friends will be free enough or rather faithful enough to give them Of this we have a famous instance in the  Roman  history The great  Pompey  after the many victories he had obtained and the great conquests he had made had certainly a good title to the esteem of the people of  Rome  yet that great man by some error in his conduct became an object of general dislike and therefore in the representation of an old play when  Diphilus  the actor came to repeat these words  Nostra Miseria tu es Magnus  the audience immediately applied them to  Pompey  who at that time was as well known by the name  Magnus  as by the name  Pompey  and were so highly pleased with the satire that as  Cicero  says they made the actor repeat the words an hundred times over An account of this was immediately sent to  Pompey  who instead of resenting it as an injury was so wise as to take it for a just reproof He examined his conduct he altered his measures he regained by degrees the esteem of the people and then he neither feared the wit nor felt the satire of the Stage This is an example which ought to be followed by great men in all countries Such accidents will often happen in every free country and many such would probably have afterwards happened at  Rome  if they had continued to enjoy their liberty but this sort of liberty in the Stage came soon after I suppose to be called licentiousness  for we are told that  Augustus  after having established his Empire restored order to  Rome  by restraining licentiousness God forbid we should in this country have order restored or licentiousness restrained at so dear a rate as the people of  Rome  paid for it to  Augustus  In the case I have mentioned my Lords it was not the poet that wrote for it was an old play nor the players that acted for they only repeated the words of the play it was the people who pointed the satire and the case will always be the same When a man has the misfortune to incur the hatred or contempt of the people when public measures are despised the audience will apply what never was what could not be designed as a satire on the present times Nay even though the people should not apply those who are conscious of guilt those who are conscious of the wickedness or weakness of their own conduct will take to themselves what the author never designed A public thief is as apt to take the fatire as he is apt to take the money which was never designed for him We have an instance of this in the case of a famous comedian of the last age a comedian who was not only a good poet but an honest man and a quiet  and good subject The famous  Moliere  when he wrote his  Tartuffe  which is certainly an excellent and a good moral comedy did not design to satirize any great man of that age yet a great man in  France  at that time took it to himself and fancied the author had taken him as a model for one of the principal and one of the worst characters in that comedy By good luck he was not the licenser otherwise the kingdom of  France  had never had the pleasure the happiness I may say of seeing that play acted but when the players first proposed to act it at  Paris  he had interest enough to get it forbid  Moliere  who knew himself innocent of what was laid to his charge complained to his patron the Prince of  Conti  that as his play was designed only to expose hypocrisy and a false pretence to religion it was very hard it should be forbid being acted when at the same time they were suffered to expose religion itself every night publicly upon the  Italian  stage To which the Prince wittily answered  'Tis true  Moliere  Harlequin ridicules Heaven and exposes Religion but you have done much worseyou have ridiculed the first Minister of Religion  I am as much for restraining the licentiousness of the Stage and every other sort of licentiousness as any of your Lordships can be but my Lords I am I shall always be extremely cautious and fearful of making the least encroachment upon liberty and therefore when a new law is proposed against licentiousness I shall always be for considering it deliberately and maturely before I venture to give my consent to its being passed This is a sufficient reason for my being against passing this Bill at so unseasonable a time and in so extraordinary a manner but I have my reasons for being against the Bill itself some of which I shall beg leave to explain to your Lordships The Bill my Lords at first view may seem to be designed only against the Stage but to me it plainly appears to point somewhere else It is an arrow that does but glance upon the Stage the mortal wound seems designed against the liberty of the press By this Bill you prevent a play being acted but you do not prevent its being printed therefore if a licence should be refused for its being acted we may depend on it the play will be printed It will be printed and published my Lords with the refusal in capital letters on the title page People are always fond of what is forbidden  Libri prohibiti  are in all countries diligently and generally sought after It will be much easier to procure a refusal than it ever was to procure a good house or a good sale Therefore we may expect that plays will be wrote on purpose to have a refusal This will certainly procure a good sale Thus will satires be spread and dispersed through the whole nation and thus every man in the kingdom may and probably will read for sixpence what a few only could have seen acted and that not under the expence of half a crown We shall then be told What Will you allow an infamous libel to be printed and dispersed which you would not allow to be acted You have agreed to a law for preventing its being acted can you refuse your assent to a law for preventing its being printed and published I should really my Lords be glad to hear what excuse what reason one could give for being against the latter after having agreed to the former for I protest I cannot suggest to myself the least shadow of an excuse If we agree to the Bill now before us we must perhaps next session agree to a Bill for preventing any play being printed without a licence Then satires will be wrote by way of novels secret histories dialogues or under some such title and thereupon we shall  be told What Will you allow an infamous libel to be printed and dispersed only because it does not bear the title of a play Thus my Lords from the precedent now before us we shall be induced nay we can find no reason for refusing to lay the press under a general licence and then we may bid adieu to the liberties of  Great Britain  But suppose my Lords it were necessary to make a new law for the restraining the licentiousness of the Stage which I am very far from granting yet I shall never be for establishing such a power as is proposed by this Bill If poets and players are to be restrained let them be restrained as other subjects are by the known laws of their country if they offend let them be tried as every  Englishman  ought to be by God and their country Do not let us subject them to the arbitrary will and pleasure of any one man A power lodged in the hands of one single man to judge and determine without any limitation without any controul or appeal is a sort of power unknown to our laws inconsistent with our constitution It is a higher a more absolute power than we trust even to the King himself and therefore I must think we ought not to vest any such power in his Majesty's  Lord Chamberlain When I say this I am sure I do not mean to give the least the most distant offence to the noble Duke who now fills the post of Lord Chamberlain His natural candour and love of justice would not I know permit him to exercise any power but with the strictest regard to the rules of justice and humanity Were we sure his successors in that high office would always be persons of such distinguished merit even the power to be established by this Bill could give me no farther alarm than lest it should be made a precedent for introducing other new powers of the same nature This indeed is an alarm which cannot be avoided which cannot be prevented by any hope by any consideration it is an alarm which I think every man must take who has a due regard to the constitution and liberties of his country  I shall admit my Lords that the Stage ought not upon any occasion to meddle with politics and for this very reason among the rest I am against the Bill now before us This Bill will be so far from preventing the Stage's meddling with politics that I fear it will be the occasion of its meddling with nothing else but then it will be a political Stage  ex parte  It will be made subservient to the  politics and schemes of the court only The licentiousness of the Stage will be encouraged instead of being restrained but like courtjournalists it will be licentious only against the patrons of liberty and the protectors of the people Whatever man whatever party opposes the court in any of their most destructive schemes will upon the Stage be represented in the most ridiculous light the hirelings of a court can contrive True patriotism and love of public good will be represented as madness or as a cloak for envy disappointment and malice while the most flagitious crimes the most extravagant vices and follies if they are fashionable at court will be disguised and drest up in the habit of the most amiable virtues This has formerly been the caseIn King  Charles  IId's days the playhouse was under a licence What was the consequenceThe playhouse retailed nothing but the politics the vices and the follies of the court Not to expose them nobut to recommend them though it must be granted their politics were often as bad as their vices and much more pernicious than their other follies It is true the court had at that time a great deal of wit it was then indeed full of men of true wit and great humour but  it was the more dangerous for the courtiers did then as thoroughpaced courtiers always will do they sacrificed their honour by making their wit and their humour subservient to the court only and what made it still appear more dangerous no man could appear upon the stage against them We know that  Dryden  the Poet Laureat of that reign always represents the cavaliers as honest brave merry fellows and fine gentlemen Indeed his fine gentleman as he generally draws him is an atheistical lewd abandoned fellow which was at that time it seems the fashionable character at court On the other hand he always represents the dissenters as hypocritical dissembling rogues or stupid senseless boobies When the court had a mind to fall out with the  Dutch  he wrote his  Amboyna  in which he represents the  Dutch  as a pack of avaritious cruel ungrateful rascalsAnd when the Exclusion Bill was moved in parliament he wrote his  Duke of Guise  in which those who were for preserving and securing the religion of their country were exposed under the character of the Duke of  Guise  and his party who leagued together for excluding  Henry  IV of  France  from the throne on account of his religion The city of  London  too was made to feel the partial and mercenary licentiousness  of the Stage at that time for the citizens having at that time as well as now a great deal of property they had a mind to preserve that property and therefore they opposed some of the arbitrary measures which were then begun but pursued more openly in the following reign for which reason they were then always represented upon the Stage as a parcel of designing knaves dissembling hypocrites griping usurers andcuckolds into the bargain  My Lords the proper business of the Stage and that for which only it is useful is to expose those vices and follies which the laws cannot lay hold of and to recommend those beauties and virtues which ministers and courtiers seldom either imitate or reward but by laying it under a licence and under an arbitrary courtlicence too you will in my opinion intirely pervert its use for though I have the greatest esteem for that noble Duke in whose hands this power is at present designed to fall though I have an intire confidence in his judgment and impartiality yet I may suppose that a leaning towards the fashions of a court is sometimes hard to be avoidedIt may be very difficult to make one who is every day at court believe that to be a vice or folly  which he sees daily practised by those he loves and esteemsBy custom even deformity itself becomes familiar and at last agreeable To such a person let his natural impartiality be ever so great that may appear a libel against the court which is only a most just and a most necessary satire upon the fashionable vices and follies of the court Courtiers my Lords are too polite to reprove one another the only place where they can meet with any just reproof is a free though not a licentious Stage and as every sort of vice and folly generally in all countries begins at court and from thence spreads through the country by laying the Stage under an arbitrary courtlicence instead of leaving it what it is and always ought to be a gentle scourge for the vices of great men and courtiers you will make it a canal for propagating and conveying their vices and follies through the whole kingdom  From hence my Lords I think it must appear that the Bill now before us cannot so properly be called a Bill for restraining the licentiousness as it may be called a Bill for restraining the liberty of the Stage and for restraining it too in that branch which in all countries has been the most useful therefore I must look upon the Bill as a most dangerous  encroachment upon liberty in general Nay farther my Lords it is not only an encroachment upon liberty but it is likewise an encroachment on property Wit my Lords is a sort of property It is the property of those that have it and too often the only property they have to depend on It is indeed but a precarious dependance Thank God we my Lords have a dependance of another kind we have a much less precarious support and therefore cannot feel the inconveniencies of the Bill now before us but it is our duty to encourage and protect wit whosoever's property it may be Those gentlemen who have any such property are all I hope our friends Do not let us subject them to any unnecessary or arbitrary restraint I must own I cannot easily agree to the laying of any tax upon wit but by this Bill it is to be heavily taxedit is to be excisedfor if this Bill passes it cannot be retailed in a proper way without a permit and the Lord Chamberlain is to have the honour of being chief gauger supervisor commissioner judge and jury But what is still more hard though the poor author the proprietor I should say cannot perhaps dine till he has found out and agreed with a purchaser yet before he can propose to seek for a purchaser he must  patiently submit to have his goods rummaged at their new exciseoffice where they may be detained for fourteen days and even then he may find them returned as prohibited goods by which his chief and best market will be for ever shut against him and that without any cause without the least shadow of reason either from the laws of his country or the laws of the Stage  These hardships this hazard which every gentleman will be exposed to who writes any thing for the Stage must certainly prevent every man of a generous and free spirit from attempting any thing in that way and as the Stage has always been the proper channel for wit and humour therefore my Lords when I speak against this Bill I must think I plead the cause of wit I plead the cause of humour I plead the cause of the  British  Stage and of every gentleman of taste in the kingdom But it is not my Lords for the sake of wit only even for the sake of his Majesty's Lord Chamberlain I must be against this Bill The noble Duke who has now the honour to execute that office has I am sure as little inclination to disoblige as any man but if this Bill passes he must disoblige he may disoblige some of his most intimate  friends It is impossible to write a play but some of the characters or some of the satire may be interpreted so as to point at some person or other perhaps at some person in an eminent station When it comes to be acted the people will make the application and the person against whom the application is made will think himself injured and will at least privately resent it At present this resentment can be directed only against the author but when an author's play appears with my Lord Chamberlain's passport every such resentment will be turned from the author and pointed directly against the Lord Chamberlain who by his stamp made the piece current What an unthankful office are we therefore by this Bill to put upon his Majesty's Lord Chamberlain an office which can no way contribute to his honour or profit and yet such a one as must necessarily gain him a great deal of ill will and create him a number of enemies  The last reason I shall trouble your Lordships with for my being against the Bill is that in my opinion it will no way answer the end proposed I mean the end openly proposed and I am sure the only end which your Lordships propose To prevent the acting  of a play which has any tendency to blasphemy immorality sedition or private scandal can signify nothing unless you can likewise prevent its being printed and published On the contrary if you prevent its being acted and admit of its being printed and published you will propagate the mischief Your prohibition will prove a bellows which will blow up the fire you intend to extinguish This Bill can therefore be of no use for preventing either the public or the private injury intended by such a play and consequently can be of no manner of use unless it be designed as a precedent as a leading step towards another for subjecting the Press likewise to a licenser For such a wicked purpose it may indeed be of great use and in that light it may most properly be called a step towards arbitrary power  Let us consider my Lords that arbitrary power has seldom or ever been introduced into any country at once It must be introduced by slow degrees and as it were step by step lest the people should perceive its approach The barriers and sences of the people's liberty must be plucked up one by one and some plausible pretences must be  found for removing or hoodwinking one after another those sentries who are posted by the constitution of every free country for warning the people of their danger When these preparatory steps are once made the people may then indeed with regret see slavery and arbitrary power making long strides over their land but it will then be too late to think of preventing or avoiding the impending ruin The Stage my Lords and the Press are two of our outsentries if we remove themif we hoodwink themif we throw them in fetters the enemy may surprize us Therefore I must look upon the Bill now before us as a step and a most necessary step too for introducing arbitrary power into this kingdom It is a step so necessary that if ever any future ambitious king or guilty minister should form to himself so wicked a design he will have reason to thank us for having done so much of the work to his hand but such thanks or thanks from such a man I am convinced every one of your Lordships would blush to receiveand scorn to deserve  By this Bill which passed both houses all copies of plays farces or any thing wrote in the dramatic way are to lie before his Grace the Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's houshold for the time being for his Grace's perusal and approbation before they shall be exhibited on the Stage  TO THE KING's most Excellent MAJESTY  The humble PETITION of PHILIP Earl of CHESTERFIELD Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter  SHEWETH  THAT your Petitioner being rendered by deafness as useless and insignificant as most of his equals and cotemporaries are by nature hopes in common with them to share your Majesty's Royal favour and bounty whereby he may be enabled either to save or spend as he shall think proper more than he can do at present  That your Petitioner having had the honour of serving your Majesty in several very lucrative employments seems thereby entitled to a lucrative retreat from business and to enjoy  otium  cum dignitate  that is leisure and a large pension  Your Petitioner humbly presumes that he has at least a common claim to such a pension he has a vote in the most august assembly in the world he has an estate that puts him above wanting it but he has at the same time though he says it an elevation of sentiment that makes him not only desire but pardon dread Sir an expression you are used to  insist  upon it  That your Petitioner is little apt and always unwilling to speak advantageously of himself but as after all some justice is due to one'sself as well as to others he begs leave to represent That his loyalty to your Majesty has always been unshaken even in the worst of times That particularly in the late unnatural rebellion when the Pretender advanced as far as Derby at the head of at least three thousand undisciplined men the flower of the Scottish Nobility and Gentry your Petitioner did not join him as unquestionably he might have done had he been so inclined but on the contrary raised sixteen companies of one hundred men each at the public expence in support of your Majesty's undoubted right to the Imperial  Crown of these Realms which distinguished proof of his loyalty is to this hour unrewarded  Your Majesty's Petitioner is well aware that your Civil List must necessarily be in a low and languid state after the various frequent and profuse evacuations which it has of late years undergone but at the same time he presumes to hope that this argument which seems not to have been made use of against any other person whatsoever shall not in this single case be urged against him and the less so as he has good reasons to believe that the deficiencies of the Pensionfund are by no means the last that will be made good by Parliament  Your Petitioner begs leave to observe That a small Pension is disgraceful and opprobious as it intimates a shameful necessity on one part and a degrading sort of charity on the other but that a great one implies dignity and affluence on one side on the other regard and esteem which doubtless your Majesty must entertain in the highest degree for those great personages whose respectable names stand upon your Eleemosynary list Your Petitioner therefore  humbly persuades himself upon this principle that less than three thousand pounds a year will not be proposed to him if made up gold the more agreeable if for life the more marketable  Your Petitioner persuades himself that your Majesty will not suspect this his humble application to proceed from any mean interested motive of which he has always had the utmost abhorrence No Sir he confesses his own weakness Honour alone is his object Honour is his passion Honour is dearer to him than life To Honour he has always sacrificed all other considerations and upon this generous principle singly he now solicits that honour which in the most shining times distinguished the greatest men of Greece who were fed at the expence of the public  Upon this Honour so sacred to him as a Peer so tender to him as a Man he most solemnly assures your Majesty that in case you shall be pleased to grant him this his humble request he will gratefully and honourably support and promote with zeal and vigour the worst measure that the worst Minister can ever suggest to your Majesty but on the other  hand should he be singled out marked and branded by a refusal he thinks himself obliged in honour to declare that he will to the utmost of his power oppose the best and wisest measures that your Majesty yourself can ever dictate  And your Majesty's Petitioner shall ever pray  FINIS
