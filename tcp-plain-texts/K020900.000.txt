 THE TIMES  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  THE TIMES A COMEDY  AS IT IS NOW PERFORMING AT THE THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  By Mrs GRIFFITH  LONDON Printed for FIELDING and WALKER PaternosterRow J DODSLEY PallMall T BECKET Strand and T DAVIES RusselStreet CoventGarden  MDCCLXXX  ADVERTISEMENT  THE favourable reception which the following Comedy has met with from a candid and generous Public calls for my warmest acknowledgements and tho' it may be of little consequence to them to know the source of so slight an amusement I think myself bound by truth and gratitude to own that the first idea of this Piece was hinted to me by my everrespected and lamented friend Mr GARRICK who mentioned GOLDONI's  Bourru Bienfaisant  as a sketch that if adapted to our times and manners might be rendered pleasing to an English Audience Those who have read the French Piece must judge how far I have profited by GOLDONI's work but of this I am certain that had Mr GARRICK lived to afford me that friendly assistance which he has done on former occasions my Comedy would have been more worthy of the reception with which it has been honoured I will however hope that  with all its imperfections on its head  the same indulgence which attended its representation will follow it into the closet and that the Reader will allow me the only merit I presume to claim that of meaning well  I gladly take this opportunity of returning my thanks to my muchesteemed friend Mr SHERIDAN senior for his kind attention to the getting up my Play my ill health not permitting me to attend one Rehearsal But Mr SHERIDAN's friendship wherever professed is not of modern growth  I have more than common acknowledgements to make to all the Performers in my Comedy particularly to Mrs ABINGTON and Miss POPE who both chearfully undertook Parts out of their usual line of acting and in which they have both excelled I should be utterly unable to express my sentiments of Mr KING in the character of SIR WILLIAM WOODLEY if I were not at liberty seriously to adopt the very words which he humorously but justly speaks of himself under a personated character in  The Critic  But it is impossible for language to do justice to Mr KING Indeed he more than merited those repeated bursts of applause which he drew from a most brilliant and judicious Audience  I flatter myself this little tribute to distinguished merit will not be deemed tedious or impertinent by the Public for whose opinion I have the sincerest respect and to whom I have the honour to be  A much obliged And most obedient Servant THE AUTHOR  London  Dec    PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr KING  TO glow with ardour and attempt with zeal  The reformation of the public weal  Is the high duty of the COMIC MUSE  And tho' keen Attic Salt allowed to use  To season Precept and with Art to tickle  The sores she means to wash with sharpest pickle  Yet not the rosy pulpited Divine  Nor lankhair'd Methodist with rueful whine  Is more intent to root out Vice and Folly  And make ye all lead lives discreet and holy  Yet why to clear the field were all their toil  If weeds o'erspread not the luxuriant soil  Congreve or Wesley Whitfield or Moliere  In vain might prompt the laugh or bribe the tear  If no man felt or in himself or neighbour  Some failing to call forth the zealot's labour  If no fair dame descried 'midst her acquaintance  Some few who might be mended by repentance  Loose as the buxom air the Youth from College  Comes fraught with all Newmarket's hopeful knowledge  In haste to spend the Estate not yet his own  Compleats his ruin ere his beard is grown  And when to foreign climes he spreads the sail  'Tis not to enlarge his mind but 'scape a jail  Then blest the Poet happy the Divine  When Folly gives the  Ton  from Fashion's Shrine  But whilst the Priest and Satirist reprove  Those vices which provoke the wrath of JOVE  Our Author like the patient Angler sitting  To catch small fry for humbler palates sitting  Has served a Meal not seasoned high with crimes  Taste it and if approved applaud THE TIMES  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Miss FARREN  WHILE gravepaced Tragedy with Oh's and Starts  Flies at high game to move and mend your hearts  We merrier folks with spirits blithe and jolly  Just perch upon some little sprig of folly  For in this Age so pious chaste and grave  To rail at Vice must surely be to rave  Yet thanks to here and there a modish fool  The COMIC MUSE may glean some ridicule  Jews will be Jews if dupes can yet be found  And if one frail one's left on English ground  She'll find a Phaeton and pair of ponies  To elopefor all men are not Maccaronies  Those precious Dears at least would make her wait  'Twould be so vulgar not to be too late  Our sexbut shall I charge the weaker kind  Or can those fail to stray whose guides are blind  Let men reform themselves they're our examples  And goods prove seldom better than their samples  In former times the gallant British Youth  Were formed for Chivalry and Love and Truth  In such an Age in such a virtuous Nation  Love was in woman almost inspiration  But now alas I speak without a jest  Women are not inspiredthey're but possest  Men are our pilots They should mark the shelves  For when they blame us they reproach themselves  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  Sir William Woodley Mr KING  Mr Woodley Mr BRERETON  Colonel Mountfort Mr PALMER

billetdoux I am certain for I have never found him tripping that way since I have been in the family It must be some matter of business and if it is it may concern me as well as my master I have had

and ready to set out for Newmarket You'll be late on the turf Your horses run I suppose What matches have you made  Woodley  None Colonel I shall not be there this Meeting  Col  You amaze me  Woodley  Aside  Would I had never been there I am sick of the diversion and shall never make another bett on the turf while I live  Col  Why don't you dispose of your stud then It must be an enormous and now an useless expence  Woodley  Horses are the least part of the extravagances incident to racing  Col  That is  selon  Woodley for I have known several fortunes made on the turf  Woodley  Truebut by those only who had none to lose They are surest to win who carry least weight  Col  Take my advice then and sell your horses  Woodley  Why faith I wish they were disposed of But yet I don't know I should be ashamed I think to advertise them as it might look somehow as if one could not afford to keep them Ha ha ha  Col  Ridiculous supposition  Woodley  Ridiculous indeed That you know Mountfort is far from the case but I really am tired of the sport and the Meeting too is at a time of the year when there are so many more agreeable amusements to be met with in London so that I should be glad to get rid of them with all my heart  Col  Let me dispose of them for you then I'll be your Auctioneer and try if I can't emblazon their pedigree with a little of that true humour which Charles Surface bestows on his ancestors when he sets up their pictures to sale Bucephalus the famous Bucephalus Gentlemen descended in a right line from the renowned quadrupede of that name which had the honour of carrying a greater brute than himselfthe immortal Alexander  Woodley  Bravo Colonel  Col  Or shall we deduce his lineage from  Woodley  You had better consult Tattersall for their pedigree as he is your only herald in those points Heighho  Col  Heighho This is but poor encouragement for me to enter on my new profession Surely there is something malignant in the air at present for every man I have conversed with this morning seems rather to be depressed with the gloom of November than enlivened by the sunshine of April I have just now left Jack Knightly and Will Careless calculating not their nativities but their deaths  Woodley  I saw them both at Boodle's yesterday in good health  Col  Not the more likely to live for that I assure you However it was not their natural existence  but their necessary subsistence that employed their mathematics  Mr Woodley  You astonish meWhy it is but lately they came into possession of great estates  Col  Truebut then they have travelled the modern short and easy road to ruin of granting annuities for this twelvemonth past and are now so nearly arrived at the last stage of their journey that I think Jack said he had but two months to run and Will flattered himself that as the summer was approaching he might be able to hold out four I advised their compounding the terms and running together for three months each  Woodley  Poor fellows I am sorry for them  aside  Would I could promise myself even so long a reprieve  Col  What moping again Woodley You'll infect me if I stayWhere are the LadiesIn truth my visit was to them for I scarce hoped to find you here Are Lady Mary and your sister visible or shall I pass on to your Uncle's apartment and pay my respects to him I think there is a door of communication to his house from this room Shall I go this way  Woodley  That may be a service of danger Colonel for I fear Sir William is not at present much delighted either with his vicinity or affinity to any of this family except my sister  Col  I am glad to hear you can except my sweet Louisa for notwithstanding the brusqueness of his manners I have such an opinion of the old Knight's good sense and good nature that I cannot readily acquit those he is offended with as wholly free from blame  Woodley  I subscribe to your censure as far as it relates to myself but the asperity of his behaviour to Lady Mary renders me extremely unhappy and not even my past obligations or future prospects  shall ever make me acquiesce in his treating my wife with disrespect  Col  Allow me to say Woodley that persons so nearly connected ought to dispense with ceremony in favour of sincerity  Woodley  That's a dangerous tenet Colonel and may be extended 'till downright rudeness may be considered but as the privilege of familychat  Col  I think you have no cause for such an apprehension in this case as Sir William is quite as singular for goodness of heart as for a deficiency in that outward varnish which too often supplies the place of it But to compound the argument let us admit there may be faults on both sides  Enter Lady  Mary  and  Louisa  L Mary  My dear Woodley don't I look like a hag today Do you know that I have not slept an hour the whole night  Woodley  I'm sorry for it my dearI hope it was not any illness that prevented your rest  L Mary  NoI was not the least ill but the uncommon brilliancy of Lady Mushroom's earrings that I saw at the Opera in the evening twinkled all night before my eyes and would not suffer me to close them  Col  Vanity has her vigils I perceive Ladies  Louisa  That's but fair Colonel as her festivals seem to bestow such supreme delight on her votaries of both sexes  L Mary  I think now that a thousand pounds added to my own would make them outblaze Lady Mushroom's and I am sure my dear Woodley won't refuse me such a trifle  Woodley  I can refuse you nothingbut we'll talk of it some other time  Enter a Servant and delivers a Letter to Mr  Woodley  which he just runs his eye over and puts up  L Mary  What makes you look so grave my Love I should almost suppose that letter was from your Uncle if he did not live in the same house and had not a peculiar delight in seeing the effect of his own ill temper  Louisa  The reprehensions of sincere friends proceed oftener from kindness than illnature  L Mary  to Woodley  Will you send for Setwell tomorrow my Dear if you are not at leisure today I must have this bar taken out the middle stone larger and the drop at least twice this size and pray hurry him for I must positively wear them at Court next Sunday  Woodley  musing  It must be so  L Mary  You don't attend to me Mr Woodley  Woodley  O yes my Dear I hear every word you say Give me the earrings I'll carry them myself to the Jeweller  L Mary  Here they arebut don't be too extravagantI would not have more than a thousand pounds added on any account  Col  I give you credit for that last caution Lady Mary as 'tis uncommon to hear a wife restraining her husband's generosity to herself in this day  L Mary  His indulgence Colonel has ever exceeded my wishes  Woodley  But never equalled my own  aside  My heart is breaking for her  Enter a Servant who gives a printed Paper to Lady  Mary  Servant  With Mrs Bromley's compliments Madam and requests you'll do her the honour to call on her  L Mary  O 'tis the Catalogue she promised to mark for me My compliments and I shall be at her door in a few minutesLouisa are you disposed for Christ  e's Rooms this morning There are abundance of fine things and of course fine people to be there I delight in an Auction one meets with so many things there one never thought one wanted before  Louisa  Though it is not my passion I'll attend your Ladyship with pleasure  L Mary  looking over the Catalogue  See Woodley what an unconscionable creature Bromley is She has marked a whole side of the CatalogueA lustre that holds a hundred lights I think I should like that now for our grand saloon in the country I own I should delight vastly to astonish our neighbours in Dorsetshireif ever we go there Have you any objection my Dear  Woodley  But one my DearI am to settle with my Banker to day  L Mary  No matterMrs Bromley shall be my Banker Her purse is always at the service of her friendsO here's the sweetest sett of fillagree dressingplateI must have that Woodley instead of the one I have had these two years'Tis absolutely Gothic  Woodley  aside  I cannot wound her by restraint  L Mary  Don't you think Mrs Bromley a delightful creature Colonel  Two of the largest Seve vases that have ever been imported  I positively must have them How good it was in the dear Bromley to note these articlesWhy don't you tell me how you like my friend  To the Colonel  Col  I have not the honour Madam of knowing her sufficiently to judge of her character and therefore can only speak of it as doubtful  L Mary  Doubtful Colonel  Louisa  In some cases Lady Mary to doubt is rather to compliment than to censure  Col  And in other cases to doubt is to be certain  L Mary  You don't affect to be doubtful I hope Miss Woodley  Louisa  By no means I assure you Mrs Bromley's character is quite clear to me  L Mary  If you talk in this stile Louisa I shall certainly conclude that you are jealous of the dear Bromley  Louisa  I know not on what account I should be so except in your good graces for I hope you don't think me vain enough to attempt rivalling her with her present Cecisbeo Sir Harry Granger  Col  That ridiculous compound of affectation and epicurism who ruminates upon every meal and tries to preserve the relish of his sauces by a repetition of their ingredients in every new company that admits him  L Mary  You are monstrously censorious Colonel but I will allow that he is a little out of fashion at present and for that reason I have forbidden his ever coming into this house The Bromleys dine here today my Dear  to Mr Woodley  But we lose time The Auction may begin and some of the dear things I have set my heart upon be gone before we get thereI shall never forget that old frightful Mandarin Lord Gobble for whipping up the Seve China  Dejeuner  from me at the last sale  Col  Will your Ladyship permit me to have the honour of attending you  L Mary  There's a vacant seat in the coach and you shall be welcome if you won't be spiteful Good morrow Woodley Come Louisa  Exeunt Ladies and the Colonel  Woodley  SoI am once more left at leisure for my own reflection Solitude is said to be a relief to the unhappy but thought only serves to double my distress Surely my poverty begins to be apparent  or Knightly would not write so pressinglyHis note surprises me  Reads  Dear Woodley I desire you will on receipt of this let me have the three hundred pieces you lost to me at our last Meeting as I am just setting off for Newmarket and must have some weight of metal to balance the scales on the turf I shall wait at home for you exactly one hour by the best going watch in Europe and must have the cash by that time pos  Yours ever T KNIGHTLY  The peremptory stile of this billet alarms me Knightly used to be a careless liberal fellow but Mountfort told me just now that he is on the verge of ruin His state however is to be envied in comparison of mine He falls alone No wife no family at once to share and aggravate his wretchedness I'll go this moment and acquit me of his demand by parting with these toys  takes up the earrings  How much my Mary's beauty added to their lustre Let me fly from the thought  Going  Enter Mr  Bromley  Bromley  Just on the wing my dear friend How lucky thus to catch you flying as it were  Woodley  The good fortune is rather mine Mr Bromley  Bromley  No no you complimentBut where are the dear the divine LadiesMayn't I hope to be cheared with one glance from their bright eyesWhat a beautiful creature is Lady MaryDo you know she wants but little very little my dear friend to be the top of the tree the very paragon of fine taste and  bon ton  and I think she will very soon acquire that little My Dame has an excellent hand at touching up the last polish  Woodley  I allow Mrs Bromley to be perfectly elegant  Bromley  No no there you are wrongShe is pretty lively and so forth but somewhat subsy you knowBut Lady Mary Lady Mary is the thingBut what's here  taking up the earrings  A new purchase I presume They are fine very fine indeed What now may the value beSome thousands I suppose  Woodley  They did cost a pretty large sum when they were bought  Bromley  Not new then I perceivebut fine very fine indeed  Woodley  Lady Mary don't quite like the fashionthe setting I meanand therefore I should not be sorry to part with themand buy others  Bromley  aside  O that alters the case considerably Let us seelet's see Why now upon examining them closely they appear but middling very middling indeed I don't wonder Lady Mary should not like themno lustrevery old fashion'dthey'll sell for little or nothing believe me  Woodley  They cost me fifteen hundred pounds about four years ago  Bromley  Fifteen hundred poundsYou amaze meYou must have been sadly imposed upon very sadly indeed my dear friend What monstrous cheats these tradesfolks areWhy these jewels now will not bring above three hundred  Woodley  That's more than the common disproportion between buying and selling I should think Mr Bromley  Bromley  I mean in the Trade Mr Woodley Among the Trade diamonds are a drug a mere drug indeed and money is a rare jewel in all trades now I'll assure you A Gentleman or a friend perhaps might give more Come for the frolic's sake I'll turn jeweller myself and offer you a cool five  hundred for them What say you Is it a bargain Woodley  Woodley  aside  I cannot bear the thought of carrying them abroad to sellWell if you really think they are worth no more  Bromley  Nay I have overrated them but I never compute by pounds shillings and pence when dealing with a friend Diamonds are as I told you before a mere drug and cash cash my dear boy your only valuable commodity Here here it is  looking in his pocketbook  I have not quite so much about me I find  Woodley  That's unlucky  looking at his watch  for I want three hundred of it this very instant  Bromley  aside  Does the wind sit in that pointI'll seeI'll see O here is just the three hundred cut and dry my boy You shall have the other two this evening at Boodle's We'll cut a card or throw a cast for it or how you will  Woodley  I shan't go to Boodle's tonightnor do I think I shall ever play again  Bromley  aside  The knowingones are taken in I would not have given so much for the jewels if I had thought soWhat not play That's good very good indeed You have a sort of lover's quarrel to the dice I perceive But though they have I confess used you a little scurvily they'll make you amends some other time One lucky hit you know may repay all your losses  Woodley  They have so often and so fatally deceived me  Bromley  That you'll trust them again for all that  Woodley  I think not But we shall meet at dinner  Bromley  Yes yes I obey the dear sweet Lady Mary's invitation I shall bring the money with me Besides I recollect that you and I have a little  matter of business to settle but it shan't break in upon our pleasures tho' You shall have no trouble but just to set your name A memorandum is all I want my boy  Woodley  I have a particular reason for desiring that you will not mention the transaction of the jewels to my wife or even to yours  Bromley  Secretsecret as the grave my dear friendtrusty as steel my boy You may always depend upon honest Bob Bromley We shall be with you at five tho' that's rather early  going  Nay no ceremony  Woodley  I am going out this moment  Exeunt  Enter  Forward  Forward  I have listened and pryed to good purpose I think and am thoroughly confirmed in my resolution of shifting my quarters tomorrow morning Up tents and away then But I cannot help being a little concerned at leaving my master and Lady because I am sure I shall never get so good a place again All mastersno servantsevery one did as he liked It grieves me to think what a hand the rest of the servants have made of them There's the lazy Housekeeper the drunken Butler the cribbing CoachmanBut what signifies moralizing Let me look about me a little and see if there be any small matters lying loose that are of no farther use to my master and may be of some to me  Takes up a pair of lace ruffles  These have been worn but never washed and he may miss them No that's not probable as he has at least twenty pair more than he knows any thing of  puts them in his pocket  This snuffbox too is but a bauble of more curiosity than value I shall accept of it as a keepsake  pockets it  Enter Sir  William  from the middle door  Sir Will  By the quietness in the nest the birds are flown and I am glad of it My apartment smokes a little today I'll have the tables brought here and try if the game be recoverable tho' to be sure I have but little hopes for sure there never was any man so unluckyWaters  Forward  aside  What is old SquareToes ruined too Egad I should be glad of that  Sir Will  seeing  Forward  Why hey what are you doing hereWaters I say  Forward  Only removing a few useless things of my master's Sir  Sir Will  Then you will certainly remove yourself for I know nothing half so useless as a pert coxcomical lazy ValetdeChambre  Forward  As your Honour chuses to be alone I shall retire directly  Exit  Sir Will  Retire There's a phrase now for a footman But these puppies all mimic their masters even in their language and what's worse in their vices I'll answer for it that fellow now is as idle as dissipated and extravagant as my nephew himself But why do I think of a man whose misconduct has so totally alienated my affections Yet he was a sweet boy at Eton and a fine youth at College His indiscreet marriage has ruined hima fine Ladya Lady of Quality forsooth and without a fortune to support her vanity But no matter nowI renounce them bothWatersI wish Louisa was removed from this scene of folly and extravagance and safely settled in the country There is no other place for a woman to be secure in  Enter  Waters  I wish you would advance Mr Slowboots I have called you at least a dozen times  Waters  I came the very moment  Sir Will  Well well wellapologies take up timeBring the backgammon tables here then go to Counsellor Belford and desire him to come to me directly  Waters going through the middle door  Why don't you go the shortest way  pointing to the sidedoor  Waters  Your Honour bid me bring the tables first  Sir Will  Of what use are they when Belford is not here to play  Waters going  No come back and fetch the tables and I'll place the men just to shew you how I was gammoned and I think you'll allow there never was such luck  Waters  I am utterly ignorant of every point of the game Sir  Sir Will  Stupidity in the abstract How often have you been in the room while Belford and I have been playing Had we been saying or doing any thing we ought not you would have picked it up fast enough I warrant you  Waters  Indeed Sir  Sir Will  No wordsI hate pratefly to Mr Belford's  Exit Waters  I'll go and shew Jones how it was for tho' she is my Housekeeper now she is a Parson's daughter and must understand backgammon I am sure she will be astonished at Belford's move  Exit  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE  continued  Enter at opposite doors Mr  WOODLEY  and Mr  BELFORD  Woodley  HOW truly do I rejoice to see my good friend Mr Belford But may I flatter myself that the honour of this visit was intended for me  Belford  I am sorry my dear Sir that there should be a necessity for discriminating the person to whom my respects are paid in a family I so equally regard and which was once so happily united  Woodley  If indeed you regard this family or ever had any friendship for meBut I cannot speak  Belford  I am already apprized of your difficulties and would spare you the pain of even hinting at them were it in my power to redress them  Woodley  Then be assured it is for amidst all my distresses nothing afflicts me half so much as Sir William's implacable resentment against Lady Mary and me If he were but reconciled  Belford  That is in plain English my young friend if he could be reconciled to your expensive mode of living he ought in honour to assist in supporting it But that I doubt will never be brought to pass though Sir William is both rich and generous  Woodley  To all the world but me  Belford  In this case then you should suspect your own conduct rather than his characterBut remonstrances are useless now and I promise to use my utmost interest to bring about a reconciliation  But I much fear that we shall not be able to get Lady Mary included in the familycompact for I know no man more resolute in what he conceives to be right than Sir William  Woodley  My honour as well as my love obliges me to vindicate her and I here pledge them both that she is free from blame  Belford  I am glad to find you still a lover Mr Woodley but I who am but a friend in this question can't help thinking that if Lady Mary had spent more of her time in Dorsetshire and less at Spa Paris and other places of dissipation and extravagance she would have been more entitled to Sir William's esteem and you would have had less need of his assistance  Woodley  The fault was mine aloneVain of possessing such a treasure  Belford  You childishly exposed it to the gaze of fops and foreignersAnd let me tell you Mr Woodley you are a lucky man in these licentious times to have preserved such a gem pure and entire even at the expence of your other possessions But prithee why don't you now retreat into the country  Woodley  My wife is quite ignorant of my present circumstancesI have not resolution to acquaint her with themand to propose quitting London in this gay season without assigning some cause  Belford  Would in your situation be extremely prudent  Woodley  I cannot bear the thought of giving her uneasiness  Belford  And so cruelly prefer the evil to the cure  Enter  WATERS  Waters  I humbly beg your Honour's pardon for my intrusion but I have been at your Chambers  and at the Temple Coffeehouse to look for you My master is quite impatient to see you Sir and one of Mr Woodley's servants told me you were here  Woodley  This seems to fall out luckily I will not detain you a moment Dear Belford remember what a cause you have in hand  Belford  Do not distrust my attention to my client tho' I cannot warrant success to the suit  Exit  Woodley  Waters  I cannot tell your Honour how proud I am to meet you My good dear master has been as angry with me for not finding you at home as if I had committed the greatest of faults and I would die rather than vex him  Belford  I know my friend's hasty temper perfectly well but I also know that his goodnature is an overmatch for it  Waters  O Sir you don't know how good and generous he is  Belford  You are mistaken Waters I am no stranger to Sir William's benevolence  Waters  Indeed Sir with submission you arefor he takes as much pains to conceal his goodness as others do to reveal theirs He would never forgive me if he knew I mentioned it but my heart is so glad I can't help telling your Honour that he apprenticed my eldest boy last week and pays for the schooling of the two youngest  Belford  These are noble bounties I confess Waters but I think your feelings on the occasion do as much honour to human nature as the Knight's generosityfor a liberal hand is more frequently to be met with than a grateful heartBut where is Sir William  Waters  I left him going to take a turn in the garden and I don't in the least doubt but he will come in as cool as a cucumber tho' when he went  down stairs he was as angry with me as if he had never done me any good  Belford  Shew me the way and I'll go to him directly  Exeunt thro' the middle door  SCENE  changes to a DressingRoom an elegant Toilet  Lady  MARY  and Mrs  BROMLEY  L Mary  taking up the dressing plate  They are pretty I confess but even I think them rather dear  Mrs Bromley  What an idea for my dear Lady Mary Do you know now that the equipage of Mrs Stockwell's toilet the Broker's wife cost thirteen hundred pounds  L Mary  I remember her at Parisan overdressed ThingI thought she had been a Jeweller's wife and looked upon her as a stalking shewglass to expose her husband's goods for sale But the poor man I suppose was ruined by her extravagance  Mrs Bromley  Yes yes he was  doneup  very soon after But the woman had wit in her madness however for she secreted her paraphernalia and her chariot has rolled on her personal fortune ever since Women are much wiser nowadays than they used to be  Enter Mrs  WILLIAMS  Mrs Williams  Your Ladyship's masquerade dress is just come home Ma'am  L Mary  Let me see let me see  Mrs Bromley  How beautiful My dear creature  You'll look a Goddess and you'll move a Queen  L Mary  Ah Bromley I have just recollected that I can't go as a Sultana I have sent my earrings to be altered and the rest of my jewels will make no figure without them  Mrs Bromley  Hire hire my Dear  L Mary  I don't understand you  Mrs Bromley  What a baby Mrs Williams but 'tis a sweet baby we must allow Why for fifty or a hundred guineas at most you may hire as many diamonds as would outblaze the throne of Dehli  L Mary  A hundred guineas What a sum for one night's vanity NoI'll go as a Shepherdess  Mrs Bromley  That wou'd be a disguise indeed in these days of martial ardour when our whole Sex have exchanged their old fashion'd simplicity of dress and manners for the military air the smart cockade and lively regimental  L Mary  But one may be allowed to look innocent in masquerade I hope  Mrs Bromley  Ha my little fly one have I found you outNothing but a Corydon cou'd have inspired such an idea  L Mary  All dresses I fancy are alike to Mr Woodley  Mrs Bromley  Mr Woodley Ridiculous Why surely my dear you don't think of exposing yourself to be the jest of the whole Town by going  en groupe  with your husband to a MasqueradeWould not the dear good natured Sir Harry Granger or even the wise Colonel Mountfort make a better Corydon for our sweet Shepherdess think you  L Mary  How idly you talkMountfort is Louisa's

indeed about a poor hundred guineas Do you know now that I would not have this story told of you in any polite circle for treble the sumIf it should take wind you'd be sneered to death with encomiums

my Dear what jewels would you have  L Mary  You can't imagine how much distressed I am upon this trifling subject I'm resolved not to ask Mr Woodley for money today  Mrs Bromley  Borrow then You may

Will  Well I am patient but don't harp again on the same stringNo more of Mr Woodley  Belford  You have a noble fortune Sir William  Sir Will  Yes thanks to Providence more than I have occasion for myself and therefore I consider the overplus but as a bank for my friendsDo you want money Belford Name the sum and take it  Belford  Thank you Sir William but 'tis not my wants I wish you to supply but those of your nephew  Sir Will  What at it again I will not give him a doitnot a doit Sir My fortune shall not be lavished to indulge his vanity or supply his prodigality  Belford  I am persuaded he has so thoroughly reflected upon his past folly that he would make a proper use of your future kindness  Sir Will  Let him alter his conduct first if he expects I should alter mine His repentance may merit my bounty but my liberality shall not prevent his reformation  Belford  But if Mr Woodley should be undone what will become of your niece  Sir Will  Let her share his fate as she has done his follyshe has earned itAn extravagant woman that could not be content to live at one of the finest Seats in England but must frisk it to Spa and Paris forsooth like the rest of the silly English to squander their money and be laughed at by Foreigners  Belford  I understood Miss Woodley had remained in England  Sir Will  What Louisa I did not speak of hershe is the best girl on earthNo noshe

as much more at present and my whole estate after my deathNo nothat won't be acting justlyWoodley may have childrenThey have not offended me though their father hasand if they should be half so pleasant as he was when he was a child I should love them dearly as I once did him But I must strive to forget all that business nowHere comes Louisa  Enter Lady  MARY  who keeps at a distance without

send for you I insult youThat blundering WatersNo Madam you are the last person in the world except your husband that I should think of sending for  L Mary  The respect I have for you Sir as Mr Woodley's relation must make it extremely painful to me to know that I am so disagreeable to you  Sir Will  Respect for me Madam I don't desire your respect nor deserve your respect  aside  If she talks in this way she'll stagger my resolutionI wanted to speak with my niece Madam and my blundering servant  L Mary  Has brought you one that is proud of that title Sir  Sir Will  You have a title of your own MadamI hate titlesand one reason why I never married was because I would not have my wife called my Lady  L Mary  I see Sir William that you are not inclined  Sir Will  To converse with  Ladies  MadamI would speak with Louisa upon business  L Mary  I shall no longer obtrude on you Sir but before I go must request you'll explain what you meant by saying that Mr Woodley was ruined  Sir Will  aside  She knows nothing of the matter I find and I cannot bear to shock herI think Madam you ought to understand that matter as well as IRuinedWhy 'tis a common phrase at present MadamDukes Lords and Commons nay the whole Nation are ruined Madam'tis  quite the  Ton  and I suppose that neither Mr Woodley nor you would chuse to be out of the fashion  L Mary  I hope Sir you'll allow that Mr Woodley's fortune and my rank entitles us  Sir Will  To be ruined in good company Madam  aside  She has touched the right key now I'm no more afraid of her Had she fallen acrying I might have been ruined too  L Mary  I am sorry to find Sir that your prejudices against Mr Woodley and me are so strong that it would be in vain for us to attempt a justification of our conduct  Sir Will  Quite so indeed Madam  L Mary  I shall therefore take my leave Sir  going  Sir Will  aside  You have mine with all my heart  L Mary  Shall I send Miss Woodley to you Sir  Sir Will  No Madam no I'll send for

alone  If Belford should succeed with my uncle all may yet be well Something must be done and quickly too I can no longer endure the agony of endeavouring to impose upon the world and myself by personating a borrowed character But here she comes who innocently adds to all my sufferings and tips the darts of poverty with anguish  Enter Lady  Mary  L Mary  O my dear Woodley such a trial ordeal as I have undergone I declare I would rather be buried alive in Dorsetshire than endure such another  têteàtête  He has done every thing but beat me  Woodley  I don't comprehend youWhom do you mean  L Mary  Nay that's downright perverseness for I am certain there is not such another creature upon earth as your precious Uncle  Woodley  I hope you have not quarrelled with him Lady Mary  L Mary  No truly he has spared me that trouble by quarrelling with me most outrageously  Woodley  aside  Then all my hopes in Belford are at an end I am very sorry you happened to come in his way  L Mary  I'm sure so am I Mr Woodley The interview was not of my seeking and though I was as mild as a lamb he was as rude as a bear The deuce take his blundering servant for bringing me into such a scrape  Woodley  I should hope that your regard for me would have prevented  L Mary  And so it did I assure you for I did not laugh tho' he said something so ridiculous  about your being ruined the Nation being ruined and all the world being ruined that I had much ado to keep my countenance However I behaved very decently all the while and even condescended to entreat that he would give you leave to justify your conduct to him  Woodley  And did my dear Mary obtain his permission  with eagerness  L Mary  Your earnestness startles me Mr Woodley Of what consequence can the oldfashioned opinion of an obstinate Don Choleric who hates us both be of to us I wish he would endow an Hospital with his fortune that our solicitude to please might end with our expectations  Woodley  Mine should not I assure you  L Mary  That must be as you please Mr Woodley but I declare that from this hour  Woodley  Make no rash vows Madam You know not how much you have been or may be indebted to Sir William  L Mary  I indebted to him No Mr Woodley that I positively deny  Enter Mr and Mrs  Bromley  Mr Bromley  entering  And so do I with both my hands and all my heart for be the question in Law Physic or Divinity I'll pawn my life on't that Lady Mary is right  L Mary  I am much obliged to you for your good opinion Mr Bromley  Mrs Bromley  And I wager on Mr Woodley's side were it only to keep up the argument The question then  Mr Bromley  Ay ay the question  L Mary  to Mrs Bromley  There are secrets in all families you know my dear Bromley  Woodley  And it is always prudent to keep them so Lady Mary  Mr Bromley  Very good very good indeed  Mrs Bromley  Curiosity thank heaven is not one of my failings 'Tis ever a mark both of ignorance and illbreeding I am astonished how any one can be infected with such an impertinent weakness  Mr Bromley  Yes yes my Dame is quite above all silly curiosity  aside  The veriest eavesdropper that ever existed She'll not rest 'till she has got the whole story and I shall have it the moment we get home  Mrs  Bromley  shews a Box of Jewels to Lady  Mary  L Mary  They are quite charming indeed I shall outblaze the Queen of Diamonds  Woodley  What jewels are these I hope you have not bought them Lady Mary  L Mary  You hope I have not bought themWhat an odd speech Mr Woodley No I have only borrowed them and will lend you part if you'll go  en Turc  I can spare enough to ornament his turban can't I Bromley  Mrs Bromley  Surely you don't persist in making a family party Lady Mary  L Mary  to Mr Woodley  You shall have these  Woodley  Prithee don't teize me Lady MaryI shall not go to the Masquerade  Exit  L Mary  aside  Don't teize me Something extraordinary must have disturbed him  Mr Bromley  You'll have a charming squeeze at your rout Lady Mary Not a vacant chair to be found in the whole house I warrant you  L Mary  You flatter me No I believe there will hardly be any body Do you know that I have had a hundred and ninetyone excuses within these two days  Mrs Bromley  Ay but you'll have nine hundred  and ninety people for all that I hope Lady Sitfast won't come That woman never orders her carriage till near one tho' she plagues the servant to call it up every five minutes after eleven  L Mary  Then there's that poor drooping Mrs Henpeck who always loses and sits moaning over her losses and playing the aftergame 'till the servants are obliged to put her out along with the candles  Enter  Forward  L Mary  No more excuses I hope  Forward  Dinner is served please your Ladyship  Mrs Bromley  Is Sir Harry Granger come  L Mary  O no he has no longer the  entrée  here  Mr Bromley  I'm heartily sorry for it No man tempers a sallad like Sir Harry He is a perfect compendium of the whole art of cookery and has more good receipts in his pocketbook than ever were published by the celebrated Hannah Glass  L Mary  Most excellent qualifications for a man of fashion  Mr Bromley  True very true indeed Eating is the rage the high ton at present and indeed is one of the most refined of our modern studiesWill your Ladyship permit me the transcendant honour of your fair hand  L Mary  I attend Mrs Bromley  Exeunt  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE  a DiningParlour  Sir  WILLIAM  and Mr  BELFORD  at a Table with a Bottle and Glasses  Sir Will  I AM no drinking man myself Belford but yet I do not approve of this water system of yours It keeps the spirits too low  Belford  To say or do any thing mad or foolish I grant it may But if water does not raise it never depresses the spirits Can you say as much for your generous wine  Sir Will  Well well I won't dispute with you because I hate argument and as you are an honest fellow I can venture to take my glass chearfully in your company tho' you don't partake of my liquor But I'd give something ay more than I'll mention that you'd share only one pint of claret with me now  Belford  I have made no vows Sir William and to humour a friend can easily dispense with rules of my own making So here's your fair niece Louisa Woodley in a bumper  Sir Will  Thank you thank you my good friend She is a most excellent girl and I like to have her toasted by such a man as you I wish she was well settled with all my heart  Belford  There can be no doubt of her marrying to advantage She is a fine young woman with a fine fortune  Sir Will  And so may be sacrificed to some fine young man that may spend her fortune in finery as her hopeful brother has done and leave her a beggar  No noI'll prevent thatI have thought of a match for herFill your glass Belforda prudent sober sensible man  aside  I wish he'd take the hint  Belford  Rare qualities indeed for a young man of fashion to possess in these days Sir William  Sir Will  Who told you that he was a  young man of fashion  Why Sir there have been no  men  born at least for these last thirty yearsall monkies and macaronies No Hearts of Oak now Belfordall dwindled dwindled into aspens  Belford  Your sarcasm is rather too general my good friend Courage is the birthright of an Englishman and while one acre of our soil remains both the Oak and the Laurel will thrive on itWe must not prejudge the rising generation and I have not the least doubt but your niece will make a very proper choice  Sir Will  A choice I hope she has been better educated than to have a choice Sir I was not consulted in her brother's match and you see the consequenceI shall dispose of Louisa in my own wayI have a husband now in my eye for her Belford  Belford  Whoever obtains Miss Woodley will I dare say be a very happy man  Sir Will  Stick to that my dear BelfordYes yes whoever marries Louisa will be a very happy man and I am extremely glad you think so  aside  I wish he'd come to the point  Belford  You know Sir William that I have long been acquainted with Miss Woodley's merit  Sir Will  You charm me my dear Belford I am glad you know her worth and you will therefore cherish itShe is mild and timidbut you'll be kind and gentle to her even for my sake my good old friend  Belford  Kind and gentle to her  and your  good old friend  Sir Will  Why are not you my friend  Belford  Most certainly  Sir Will  Then why all this reiteration If you marry Louisa  Belford  I marry her Sir William  Sir Will  Yes SirDid you not this moment allow that who ever married her would be a very happy man And I suppose you can have no possible objection to being a very happy man Mr Belford  Belford  Yes Sir the strongest in the world if my happiness is to be purchased at the expence of another's miseryBut I am wrong for being serious when I am certain you do but jest  Sir Will  In the first place Sir I never said any thing in jest since I was bornAnd secondly Sir I never was more in earnest in the whole course of my life I therefore request from you a serious answerJest indeed No truly Counsellor I am no joker  Belford  Why then Sir I should think myself highly honoured  Sir Will  Psha psha psha  Belford  Patience my good friend  Sir Will  No SirI will have no patience with your nonsensical complimentsnone of your honours I say  Belford  In a word then Sir William the disparity of years between fortyeight and eighteen  Sir Will  Is just nothing at allWhat need you tell her you are fortyeight  Belford  There will be no occasion I grant youSelfevident propositions need no proof  Sir Will  Hark'ye Belford you fatigue me to death with your logic and sophistryThe point  may be reduced to two wordsWill you marry my niece or no  Belford  It is a match so infinitely beyond my pretensions Sir William  Sir Will  I hope I may be allowed the best judge in that matter Mr Belford  Belford  By no means Sir William your partial kindness towards me  Sir Will  Is almost worn out by your tiresome false modestyand if I thought I should have as much plague with Louisa as I have had with you I'd renounce my project and leave her to die an old maid  Belford  The proposal is so highly favourable to me  Sir Will  That you consent  Belford  Were I certain that Miss Woodley's inclinations  Sir Will  I told you before that I could dispose of them as I pleased so that if you have no other objection I shall carry my point and settle one of my family to my entire satisfaction at last  Belford  It is impossible that I can have any objection if she has none  Sir Will  Your hand then my dear Belford'Tis a matchOrder your clerks to set about the writings directlyYour estate lies in Staffordshire I thinkYou know I add ten thousand to her fortune  Belford  But surely my dear Sir William Miss Woodley ought to be made acquainted  Sir Will  Why has she not been acquainted with you ever since she was born If I mistake not you were present at her christeningThe wedding shall be next weekThe sooner my dear girl is happily settled the better  Belford  Your kindness overwhelms mebut still Miss Woodley  Sir Will  Shall be made acquainted with her happiness this evening I leave all the articles of settlement to your own honourI know you'll make a proper provision for my niece because it is possible you may die before herbut no pinmoney I charge you'Tis but a prelude to alimony believe me  Belford  I shall endeavour to acquit myself as such a generous confidence deserves  Sir Will  Hurry hurry your clerks and bring this happy event to a speedy conclusion my dear nephew  Belford  I have the strongest motives to enforce their diligence as well as the highest sense of my obligations to your friendship  Sir Will  No speecheshasten the business and adieu  Exit  Belford  I'll speak to Jones directly to prepare for the weddingdinner She can't bear to be hurried and I'd have every thing magnificent on that day which I shall deem the happiest of my whole life because it will be the first time I could ever get any of my family to know their own interest and act as I would have them  going off  Enter  Louisa  Sir Will  I am very glad to see you my dear childAnd now what have you to say to me  Louisa  I was informed Sir by my sister that you desired to speak with me and I am therefore come to receive your commands  Sir Will  Why my dear it will neither be questions nor commands but crosspurposes if you keep at such a distance as will make it impossible we should hear one another Come nearer I sayWhat are you afraid of  Louisa  advancing  Sir  Sir Will  So sothat will doAnd now my dear child you can't imagine what a heavenly temper  I am in and what favourable dispositions I have towards you  Louisa  I am very happy Sir  Sir Will  So you'll say my dear when you know all But you must deserve my kindness by your franknesstherefore first tell me whether you have any particular objection to matrimony  Louisa  It is a subject Sir that I have never much thought upon  Sir Will  That's singular now for I am told that the girls of these days think of nothing else But luckily there is no occasion for your considering about the matter as you have such a friend as I am to consider for you child  Louisa  Sir  Sir Will  And so I shall make your mind easy at once by letting you know that I have provided a husband for you  Louisa  aside  Now Heaven forbid  Sir Will  And such a one as is not to be met with every day I assure youa man after my own hearthas not a fault Louisa but that he is a waterdrinker But I won't anticipate by telling you his name He shall surprise you with it himselfWhy heywhat's the matter now You don't seem at all overjoyedYou are not hankering after a title I hope for believe me niece if there be either happiness or virtue left in the present world they are only to be met with in the middle ranks of life What makes you tremble so  Louisa  You are not unacquainted with my timidity Sir  Sir Will  Yes yes I understand the timidity of your whole sex  aside  Doves before marriage and Kites afterYou'll soon get the better of your timidity I'll answer for it  Louisa  As I am certain Sir that 'tis your wish to make me happy  Sir Will  You are right my dear but it must be my own way Your brother's want of respect to my opinion you see has been his ruin child Don't attempt to copy him Louisa  Louisa  If you would but condescend to hear me Sir  Sir Will  Why child I know every thing already that you would wish to say Your obligations to me and your modesty and your timidity and your settlement and all that  Louisa  Dear Sir I have not a thought about a settlement  Sir Will  Well well every thing shall be taken care of except a provision for a separate maintenance I bar that for if you can't live happily with such a husband as I have chosen for you I should think you deserved to starve tho' you were my niece a thousand times  Louisa  But my dear uncle  Sir Will  But my dear niece don't insist upon it for a woman who thinks of separation at the moment of her union does not intend to abide by her husband as she ought to do 'till death do them part  Louisa  I neither think of union nor separation Sir  Sir Will  Modest and virtuous that  Louisa  Hear me but one word Sir  Sir Will  Enough's said enough's said my dear Here take this bill to provide for your dress I'd have every thing handsome The ladies are great belles in Staffordshire and I'd have my niece make as good an appearnace as any  private gentlewoman  among them Why don't you take the bill 'Tis for five hundred pounds and I hope you think that sufficient  Louisa  I have no sort of occasion for it Sir and if you would but indulge me with a moment's conversation  Sir Will  Psha psha pshaI hate all this affected delicacy Take money from the old man whenever you can get it Hasten your milliners and mantuamakers and get all your matters ready by this day se'nnight for I won't have the wedding deferred an hour longer Delays are ever dangerous  Exit throwing the bill on the table  Louisa  What in the name of wonder can this dear kind cruel uncle of mine intend for me I almost doubt whether I wake or not Married in a week to a man perhaps I never saw No that's impossiblehe is too good to think of such an union Possibly Mountfort may have applied for his consent before he asked mineToo fond a hope I fearI wish I could see Counsellor Belford my uncle keeps no secret from him and he is a friend to all our family I'll write to him to come to me instantly  fits down to the table  Enter Mr  Belford  without seeing  Louisa  Belford  I cannot proceed on this business in earnest till Sir William has had some conference with his niece It is possible she may dislike the match or perhaps be otherwise engagedand then I should become the standing jest of all my brother Benchers I must speak to Sir William again  Louisa  My good Mr Belford I never was so glad to see you in my whole life I have been this moment writing to you  Belford  You make me the happiest of mortals Madam  aside  This Brief opens well I need not be much afraid of being laughed at now  Louisa  There is something so particular  aside  I know not how to mention itMr Belford my good uncle has  Belford  I find completed his kindness and acquainted you Madam  Louisa  No Sir but as you share his confidence I must entreat that you'll inform me  besitates  Belford  aside  Her modesty distresses me vastly but I like her the better for it I wish I had a speech readyDid not Sir William Madam say any thing of matrimony to you  Louisa  You can't imagine Sir how he has surprised and terrified me by talking of my being to be married in a week  Belford  You might be surprised to be sure Madam but I don't see any occasion for your being terrified any more than for such a violent hurry The writings can't be properly engrossed in that time The Law seldom keeps pace with a Lover's wishesand however impatient I may be to expedite this business you shall not be hurried fair Lady but be at liberty to name your own day  Louisa  It shall be Doomsday thenHowever I thank you Sir for allowing me even a reprieve  Belford  aside  Heydey Where sits the wind nowYou have no absolute aversion to marriage I hope Miss Woodley  Louisa  I despise affectation Sir and am above disguise with an old friend like youI have no aversion to marriage when I can bestow my hand with my heartbut I would rather die than be sacrificed to a frightful fordid wretch who has trepanned my uncle out of his consent because he despaired of mine and takes me merely as an appendage to my fortune  Belford  aside  How lucky was my coming backBut why should you suppose Madam that your uncle would  sacrifice you to a frightful sordid wretch  Your intended husband is a very different kind of man I'll assure you Madam  Louisa  Let him be what he will Sir I shall detest him  Belford  I never thought Miss Woodley that my conduct or character had in any instance merited your detestation Madam  Louisa  Detest you Mr Belford No that's impossibleBut how are you concerned in the matter  Belford  Not much at present Madamfor I scorn to take advantage of your uncle's engagements unless ratified by your consent  Louisa  Oh Mr Belford  Belford  Nay never whimper about it I own I suspected from the first that it was rather too good news to be truebut don't make yourself unhappy Miss Woodley for I would rather live and die a batchelor than marry the finest woman in England as is now the case  bowing  who was not equally ready  to have and to hold  Louisa  Generous worthy man  Belford  Not more generous than prudent Madam on this occasion But as I hope I have now deserved your confidence Miss Woodley tell me then if you have any particular attachment and I shall endeavour to serve you with Sir Williamthough I know I shall for a time stand in the light of a culprit before him by declining the honour he intended me  Louisa  You overpower me with obligations Mr Belford  Belford  No speeches my dear Madam If I was not sufficiently gratified by the honour of the act no acknowledgements could make me amends for the disappointment so frankly name the happy man who is to raise my envy and compleat your happiness  Louisa  Though I think that a wellplaced and mutual affection need not raise a blush upon the chastest cheek yet mine will glow when I name Colonel Mountfort  Belford  Colonel Mountfort I'm sorry for it▪  Louisa  Why so Sir  Belford  Because he's a very pretty fellow Madam and for that reason may fall within your uncle's chapter of coxcombs and prevent his consent  Louisa  Then I shall never give mine to marry any man else  Belford  That's somewhat in the Knight's own stile Miss Woodley But I heartily wish you success and shall shew myself a warmer Friend than a Lover by using my best pleadings in my rival's suit  Louisa  Accept my warmest thanks my good old friend  Exit  Belford  Ay ayI knew she would always think of me as her  old  friend  Exit  SCENE  changes to Mr  WOODLEY's  A DiningRoom  Mr  WOODLEY  and Mr  BROMLEY  at a Table with a DiceBox  Woodley  I'll play no more  Mr  Bromley  Why to be sure my dear friend luck has run confoundedly against you but I never saw you give out for such a trifling loss before  Woodley  Seven hundred pounds is no trifle Mr Bromley  Mr  Bromley  A trifle indeed to a person of your immense fortune  Woodley  You have made a false estimate of my circumstances I am rather a distressed man at present Mr Bromley  Mr  Bromley  aside  Are you so Then 'tis time for me to take care of myselfYou surprise me vastly Distressed did you say  Woodley  I hate to repeat it but 'tis so true that I had some thoughts of applying to your friendship to extricate me out of my present difficulties Mr Bromley  Mr Bromley  Command me

Mr Bromley  Play among friends is wrong very wrong I confess Colonel but one can't be always grave and wiseCome my dear Woodley let us make an end of our businessthe pen or the box my dear boy  Woodley  aside  Desperate situations require desperate remediesGive me the box  they throw  Damn the dice  Mr Bromley  'Tis double now you know my unlucky friend which makes upon the whole exactly the sum of seven thousand three hundred and fiftyfour pounds including the dear Lady Mary's trifling debt to Mrs Bromley  Woodley  True Sir  Mr Bromley  Well I have brought a bond with me and when I have filled up the blanks if you please we'll perfect it in the next room  Woodley  With all my heart  aside  Sure never man was so completely unfortunate Never by Heaven will I touch a die again  Col  Then I give you joy of your losses for I  know you are too much a man of honour to break your vow  Mr Bromley  Gamesters like lovers you know ColonelAnd after all now this is but matter of form between friends and men of honour like you and meDon't you think so Colonel  Col  I consider all compulsive obligations between men as a disgrace to human nature But while there are such things as knaves in the world Mr Bromley we must submit to the mean securities of bars and bonds But between men of honour as you say  Mr Bromley  Certainly my dear Sir men of honour are  Col  Too often the dupes of knaves Mr Bromley  Mr Bromley  aside  I don't like himWe'll talk over the affair you hinted at in the next room Command me on all occasionseverever at your service But I must attend the ladies The ladies and the coffee are powerful attractions to me You'll follow me I presume Colonel  Exit  Col  Yes with pleasure through my whole regiment with a drum at your heels I am persuaded Woodley that fellow is a knave and I wish you would exclude both him and his flaunting wife from your's and Lady Mary's society I can't conceive why you are so partial to them  Woodley  The great civilities we received from them at Spa first attached my wife to Mrs Bromley who was there in the first sets and even in London where people are more nice She keeps very good company I assure you Colonel  Col  You'll pardon me WoodleyShe is seldom seen in public but with some damaged Dowager of Quality who would be excluded from society if her title did not serve as a herald to make way for her LadyshipBut enough of them I am come to speak to you on a much more interesting subject  and to provewhat however I cannot doubtyour friendship for me  Woodley  Be assured my dear Mountfort  Col  I am soyou need not make professionstherefore with the frankness of a soldier I venture to ask the highest proof of your regard by consenting to make the fair Louisa mine  Woodley  My sister  Col  You seem to hesitate Mr Woodley My fortune is  Woodley  As unexceptionable as your character Colonel and as I truly love Louisa and should rejoice in her happiness  Col  You consent to mine Is it so my friend  Woodley  I know not how to answer you  Col  You alarm me extremely Mr Woodley For heaven's sake speak outWhat can be your objections  Woodley  None in the world to you but circumstanced as I am at present it would involve me in the greatest difficulties to be called upon so suddenly for ten thousand pounds  Col  That shall not be the case Woodley I should think even Louisa too dearly purchased at the expence of distressing you When I asked for your sister's hand I did not demand her purse nor shall I accept the one 'till I have signed a release for the other  Woodley  Mountfort that must not shall not be I never will accept of such a sacrifice  Col  Harkye Woodley A soldier's character should be uniform and if there could be one who was not liberal I should suspect his courage to be of the mere animal kind My fortune is sufficiently ample and I would as soon mount my charger cry stand and deliver as take money I don't want from a friend who does  Woodley  Your generosity Colonel  Col  Is of too selfish a nature to merit praise for I feel here  laying his hand to his heart  that the true luxury of fortune lies more in giving than in spending  Woodley  I will not lessen it by offering thanks But have you opened your trenches before the Knight of the Castle yet  pointing to the middle door  He used to speak well of you and his opinion is of some consequence in this business  Col  My sentiments are even with the good old Knight's I assure you I esteem his good qualities and do not dislike even his foibles as they are truly natural and unsophisticate But there perhaps you may see me play the usurer like any Jew He may double or treble Louisa's fortune without the least impediment from any scruple or modesty of mine  Woodley  When do you purpose to make the essay  Col  As soon as possible for 'till I have paid the proper respect due to him I do not think myself entitled to throw myself at Louisa's feet  Woodley  May success attend you my generous friend  Col  Fie Woodleyno more of thatBut adieu  Exeunt severally  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE  Lady  MARY  's DressingRoom  Lady  MARY  and Mrs  BROMLEY  Mrs Bromley  AND so that was all  L Mary  Every word I assure you But we shall soon make it up for ours are but lovers' quarrels  Mrs Bromley  Lovers talk of love after four years marriage Believe me Lady Mary 'tis all a farce  L Mary  No my dear Mrs Bromley I cannot give you credit against the feelings of my own heart I love Mr Woodley and I am firmly persuaded that he has a sincere affection for me notwithstanding the little peevishness of his behaviour today which I own makes me apprehend that something must have ruffled him extremely  Mrs Bromley  How did you like his peremptory resolve of passing the whole summer in Dorsetshire  L Mary  Not at all I confess 'tis frightful to think of itthough there is a tolerable neighbourhood  Mrs Bromley  Of empty housesNo creature stays at their family seats nowadays unless it be some antiquated Dowager who like an old Gothic corner cupboard remains fixed to the freehold  L Mary  I vow I won't go into the country'tis quite  mauvais ton  except you'll come with us and then we'll fly about to all the bathingplaces and give a masquerade at one of them  Mrs Bromley  I should like to pass a few weeks so well enoughand indeed my dear you'll be quite forgotten if you don't do something in that way But are you sure that Mr Woodley would like it for I must say though I ask your pardon Lady Mary he is dullabsolutely dull indeed my dear  L Mary  Why I own of late he has been rather gloomybut he is vastly goodnatured and never before refused any request of mine  Mrs Bromley  That may bebut had Mr Bromley talked to me in the same manner  L Mary  You would have loved him just as well as you do now  Mrs Bromley  You are admirable at guessing my dearfor as that same romantic notion of love never was the band of our connexion  L Mary  You startle me Mrs Bromley Marriage without love must surely be a state of the greatest unhappiness  Mrs Bromley  No I don't feel in the least unhappyConvenience is the best matrimonial cement and keeps many couples together for years whose love did not outlast the honeymoonBut these are mysteries into which you seem not yet initiated  L Mary  I hope I shall never know them by experience  Enter  Louisa  Louisa  My dear sister  sees Mrs  Bromley  I thought you were alone I had something in particular to tell you  L Mary  You alarm me vastly LouisaWhat is the matter my dear You know I keep no secrets from Mrs Bromley  Louisa  Another time Lady Mary Family affairs  Mrs Bromley  Pray my dear make no stranger of me  aside  I hope Mountfort has jilted he  ▪ I die to knowHas the gallant Colonel deserted my dear  Louisa  Colonel Mountfort Madam is no way concerned in the present question  Mrs Bromley  aside  Then I would not give sixpence for the whole story  L Mary  You look distressed LouisaWhat can have happened I'm all impatience  Louisa  Though I had rather be excused Lady Mary yet as you press so earnestly to know my Uncle  Mrs Bromley  aside  Psha  Louisa  Has insisted on my marrying  Mrs Bromley  Not himself hope  L Mary  Giddy creature I Whom my dear Louisa  Louisa  Counsellor Belford  Mrs Bromley  And is that all I think it a monstrous good match  L Mary  Monstrous indeedWhy he's fifty at least  Mrs Bromley  Fifty fiddlestick What does that signify He is rich enough for threescore and money money my dear qualifies all disproportions  L Mary  This is by much too serious a subject for jesting Mrs BromleyBut Sir William is not your sole Guardian Louisa and your brother I am certain will never consent to sacrifice you to his uncle's caprice  Louisa  I would not on any account my dear sister have my brother oppose Sir William in any thing as he is already but too much offended with him Besides I am in hopes that there will not be any occasion for his interposing  Mrs Bromley  aside  She's coming round I find  Enter a Servant  Serv  Mr Bromley Madam has sent the carriage and desires to speak with you at home immediately  Exit  Mrs Bromley  aside  I'm glad of the releaseWhat now can he possibly want with me But I am all obedience though it breaks my heart to leave you But I shall return quickly before any one sits down to LooAnd so my dear  to  Louisa  I leave you to settle your important matters which should be soon determined were you my sister  Exit  Louisa  Thank Heaven I am notShe is levity itself  L Mary  Her lightness Louisa extends no farther than her mannersher morals are irreproachable and when the mind is untainted its gaiety like a coloured trimming to a grave suit serves only to enliven it  Louisa  You are too partial sister for I much fear that you will one day discover Mrs Bromley's manners and morals to be  both of a piece  L Mary  No more upon the subject at presentand in truth I wonder how you can have spirits to talk of any thing else but your own melancholy situationMarried to Belford to your Grandfather  Louisa  I should be sad indeed if such a marriage was to take placebut my  Intended  has generously consented to break off the match at my request and to screen me from Sir William's displeasure at the same time  L Mary  Then the old Barrister is charming and I think I could be a little in love with him myself But I cannot submit to this new insult from Sir William What could he mean by disposing of you without deigning to consult Mr Woodley I shall insist upon an explanation of his conduct  Louisa  I again intreat you Lady Mary not to involve my brother farther with Sir Williamyou do not know the consequences  L Mary  I am quite weary of all this temporizing Louisa and as you are safe on shore you must allow me to guide the helm for myself at presentYou'll permit me at least to acquaint Mr Woodley with his uncle's contemptuous neglect of him in this matter which I shall go and do directly  Exeunt  SCENE  changes to Sir  WILLIAM  's Apartments  Sir  WILLIAM  and  WATERS  Sir Will  Well for once Waters I will acknowledge myself the happiest man in England  Waters  I am proud to hear that your Honour is so well pleased  Sir Will  Yes yes I am pleased and I won't be pleased alonethey shall be pleased tooThey shall have a noble service of plateLouisa deserves every thingshe behaved like an angel I thought I should have had more trouble with her but though it be strange it is certainly true that all girls like to be married  Enter a Servant  Serv  Colonel Mountfort Sir  Sir Will  I shall be glad to see himWa't on him up Waters  Exeunt  Waters  and Servant  The Colonel is a very good young man as young men go at presentbut nothing to compare to what his father was  Enter  COLONEL  and  WATERS  I am very glad to see you my young friend Set chairs Waters  Exit  Waters  Colonel  I am much obliged to you Sir William and happy to perceive by your looks that all inquiries after your health must be superfluous  Sir Will  I thank you SirI fancy indeed I do look tolerably well for serenity of mind goes a great way towards clearing up the countenance and I do not know when my spirits have ever been so harmonized as at this moment  Col  aside  How fortunateMay I flatter myself Sir William that the present happy temper of your mind will assist my suit and render you propitious  Sir Will  Propitious NonsenseYou are an idle young rogueWith such a noble fortune as yoursBut I won't scold nowYou have been on the Turf I suppose or fleeced at the GamingtableBut I hope the  Terra Firma  is safe I should be grieved to see my old friend's estate in the hands of knaves or sharpersWhat sum do you want I know you to be a man of honour  Col  You quite amaze me Sir by suspicions which I will be bold to say are unworthy both of Sir William Woodley and me I am no gambler Sir nor have I dissipated the noble inheritance derived from my ancestors  Sir Will  I am heartily glad of it SirI ask your pardon young man  aside  What the deuce then can he want from me  Col  If I were so unfortunately weak as you for a moment seemed to imagine the respect I bear you would have prevented my applying to you upon such an occasion as your good opinion Sir is of the greatest consequence to my happiness  Sir Will  There you are wrong Colonelyou had much better apply to me than to any one elseI am no cent per cent manI never received a shilling interest from any friend in my life and I have my doubts whether I should even take it from the Funds now that the Nation is so poorBut come Colonel if you don't want money in what other way can I possibly serve you I have no interest at Court  Col  You have an interest Sir in what is far dearer to me than either wealth or prefermentyour lovely niece Louisa Sir  Sir Will  aside  Thank Heaven she is better disposed of  Col  You pauseDo not keep me on the rack Sir William  Sir Will  I was only recollecting myselfAm much obliged to you Sir for the honourI think that's the phraseyou intend my niece but she's married Sir  Col  Married Sir William  Sir Will  Yes Sirmarried and settled in the country  Col  This raillery is rather cruel Sir  Sir Will  I never joke SirI have passed my word that she shall be married this day se'nnight and if all the Emperors Kings Princes and Potentates in Europe nay the Great Mogul himself were to demand her in marriage William Woodley would not forfeit his promise so that married she is to all intents and purposes my gay Colonel  Col  And has Miss Woodley consented Sir  Sir Will  Ay to be sure I force nobody  Col  aside  ConfusionImpossible Sir  Sir Will  Why should you think so She is a modest dutiful girl It would be hard indeed if I was to have no comfort in my family But don't be disheartened Colonel Many a gallant soldier has met with a repulse before now  Col  If you could conceive the tenderness of my affection for Miss Woodley Sir you would not treat my sufferings so slightly  Sir Will  It may be a disappointment to be sure Sir for she is a fine young woman I confess but my friend has her Sir and you must think of her no more  Col  It is not in my power to obey your injunction  aside  I wish it were false and ungrateful girlBut pray Sir who is the envied man so doubly blessed in your friendship and Miss Woodley's love  Sir Will  That's a secret Colonel  Col  That I think I have a right to know Sir  Sir Will  What you want to exercise your valour a littlesa sa saby challenging your rival But keep your prowess for the common foe we cannot spare a soldier at present Colonel  Col  This treatment is unlike yourself Sir William But Miss Woodley I suppose will inform meI presume she is not bound to keep the secret  Sir Will  There you are wrong again my young hero for she really is bound by the strongest of all possible tiesthe not knowing it  Col  You cannot now be serious Sir and I will try if I have yet power enough over Louisa's heart to make her sofor I will know my rival Adieu Sir William  Exit  Sir Will  Your servant Colonel HuffCap What a hotbrained boy I am doubly glad Louisa has escaped himI would have no passionate man in the family but myself How lucky 'tis that Louisa does not know her husband's nameWomen should ever be kept in ignorance to prevent mischief I have conducted this business most admirablyI have some doubts however whether my nephew should not be made acquainted with it but he does not deserve my confidence and he shan't vex me now  Enter Mr  BELFORD  Sir  WILLIAM  runs and embraces him  Are all things going on briskly and cleverly as they should do my dear nephew  Belford  The swiftest bowl does not always hit the jack Sir William and "fair and softly" is an established maxim in the Law  Sir Will  Well well we must submit but I hope you'll use as much dispatch as possible  Belford  Dispatch  is a term Sir not to be found in any Law Dictionary that I know of and I fancy it will be a long time before the matters you talk of will be dispatched  Sir Will  Why surely you have a mind to try my temper with your fair and softly But if you knew as much as I do you would perhaps think it worth while to mend your pace a little for  many things fall out between the cup and lip  Mr Belford  Belford  aside  So you'll find presentlyThe most material point in this important affair does not appear to be yet adjusted  Sir Will  Nowwhat can he mean  Belford  There can be no marriage without the consent of parties and I don't find that Miss Woodley  Sir Will  If I was not in the most heavenly temper you would put me in a rage Have I not told you Sir that she had no consent no choice but what I please to give And in twenty years acquaintance have you ever known me say an untruth Sir My niece is all compliance and gentleness and you'll be a very happy man my dear nephew  Belford  I should be unworthy of happiness if I could enjoy it on such terms Sir William  Sir Will  Why what's the matter BelfordYour head seems to be turned with your good fortune and you want to turn mine No man that is unworthy can be happy  Belford  In short Sir William  Sir Will  Ay ay that's the thingnow you talk sense I like  in short  stick to that my friend If  you want more clerks don't value expence I'll clear all costsYou know I hate the Law's delay  Belford  No law but that of honour has any thing to do in this case Sir William and however irksome the task I must beg you will permit me to undeceive you  Sir Will  Then you acknowledge you have deceived me I am thunderstruck  Belford  No my good friend'tis you that have deceived yourself  Sir Will  Your proposition is false Sir I never deceived myself nor any one else since I was born Sir I scorn and abhor deceit Mr Belford But come Sir let me know what all this roundabout tends to Despise the chicanery of your profession and speak as if you was a witness on the tablenot a Lawyer at the bar Sir  Belford  I fear I shall rather appear a criminal at the bar to you at present Sir William  Sir Will  What then you are married I supposehave a wife already Nay don't smile Sir there is no joke in this matter and you ought to have been hanged if you had married my niece  Belford  I think so too though not upon the account you mention as I give you my honour I have no wife and if I continue in my present mood may venture to say that I never shall have one  Sir Will  Mighty well mighty ill Mr Belford You have rewarded my sincere friendly attachment  Belford  With true gratitude Sir  Sir Will  Don't offer to say so What to spurn my niece with twenty thousand pounds Let me tell you Sir  Belford  That she is much too good for me  Sir Will  Why really I begin to think so  Belford  I rejoice therefore my dear friend  Sir Will  No Sir don't rejoice I am not your friend nor ever will be your friend You have  broke my heartfrustrated all my schemesdisappointed my niecePoor girl I feel for herYoung minds are easily broken by griefYou will have much to answer for on her account I assure you Mr Belford  Belford  I should have much more to answer for to Miss Woodley Sir William if I did not decline the match  Sir Will  Decline Zounds Sir I won't bear so contemptuous an expression  aside  I wish I had not been quite so peremptory with the ColonelIf I could bring myself to unsay what I have once uttered I would give Louisa to Colonel Mountsort to vex you  Belford  I agree with you Sir William that it would be a more suitable match  Sir Will  Don't agree with me Mr Belford I won't suffer it  Belford  Allow me at least to say  Sir Will  No Sir I won't allow you to say any thing but yes or no to this simple question Do you accept or reject my niece  Belford  The phrase is rather too strong Sir but I have already told you that upon mature consideration I decline the honour  Sir Will  Confound your honour and your consideration tooAnd now Sir I decline any further conversation connection or correspondence with you and so Sir I amnoI am not your humble servant  Exit  Belford  His rage will soon subside and we sha  l be as good friends as ever I am glad his resentment is entirely pointed at me as 'tis probable that to make his niece amends for the loss of a husb  nd she did not like he may give her one she doesand so ends exactly as it should the matr  monial schemes of an Old Batchelor  Exit  SCENE  changes to Mr  BROMLEY's  A DiningRoom  Enter Mr and

been with Woodley's attorney Mr Fleece'em a very honest man and for a small token of friendship he has informed me that there will be six executions in the house to morrow  Mrs Bromley  Six executions Nay then they are  done up  indeed and it does not signify much keeping any further terms with them Yet I still wish you would postpone this ugly business 'till we are gone to the masquerade Poor Lady Mary it will be a sad disappointment to her not to shew her finery  Mr Bromley  Now you talk of finery here look at these  shewing her Lady  Mary  's earrings  Mrs Bromley  Let me see They are Lady

as you can be I am certain that no person ever proposed to me for Louisa but yourself and she could not possibly give her consent before it was asked  Colonel  This assurance has revived my hopes a little but 'tis impossible my heart can be at ease till your sister has pronounced my doom  Woodley  If she consults her own heart Mountfort you will not I fancy have much reason to complain of her sentence But as she is the only Oedipus that can expound this riddle let us apply to her for the explanation  Rings  Colonel  You prevent my wishes for you have an undoubted right to make the enquiry

life that Louisa has never heard of your proposal to Sir William and of course can know nothing of your anxiety  Colonel  She will be soon acquainted with both But have not you informed her  Woodley  No on my honour I have not seen her since you left me  Colonel  Your coolness on this subject Mr Woodley by no means accords with my impatience  Woodley  You wrong me Mountfort Be assured that your union with Louisa is an object my heart is set on but that heart is torn to pieces at presentI cannot speakLouisa never stays long with her uncleshe will return in a few minutes  Colonel  They will be

comingI know not what excuse to make for BelfordI fear it will be a grievous disappointment to her  Enter  LOUISA  Louisa  I come Sir most joyfully to tell you something that I am sure will give you pleasure  Sir William  My poor dear and I have something to tell you that I am sure will give you pain  Louisa  Indeed Sir I am so much rejoiced at present that there are but very few things that could render me unhappy  Sir William  aside  So much the worsethe shock will be the greater I shall never have the courage to tell herThe suddenness of this event Louisa  Louisa  Do you know it Sir  Sir William  Ay but too well my dear  Louisa  You quite surprise me Sir It is not above five minutes since it was determined  Sir William  Yes yes 'tis more than thatabove half an hour But though matters have taken an unexpected turn I would not have you fret or grieve child  Louisa  So far from it Sir that I am quite rejoiced and flattered myself that you would be so too as I know it is a point you have long set your heart uponand I must do Lady Mary the justice to declare the plan was intirely her own  Sir William  Lady Mary I guessed as muchHow did she dare to thwart my schemes  Louisa  Dear Sir have you not always wished that my brother and sister should live in Dorsetshire and now that Lady Mary has of her own accord determined to quit London you seem offended  Sir William  Softly softly child don't hurry meFor once in my life I perceive I am left behind  aside  So I find she knows nothing of Belford and that work is all to do yetGo on my dear Lady Mary you say  Louisa

request my dear you may all breakfast with me before you set out tomorrow  aside  I'll defer acquainting her till then with Belford's behaviour  Louisa  I don't believe Sir that they can set out so immediately but I am certain they will not defer a moment to accept your kind invitation on that account  Sir William  Stop child stop I won't have them come to me till the very hour they are going If

angry with you I must get you to settle this young man's affairs his debts of  honour  his  post obits  c though perhaps it may be only affording him an opportunity for  deranging  them againThat's the modern phrase I think for being overheadandears in debt  Woodley  The sufferings my follies have brought upon me Sir and the remembrance of your generosity will remain too strongly impressed on my mind to admit of my relapsing into my former errors as that would be adding ingratitude to extravagance and vice to folly  Sir William  Well well I hope soKindness should be the strongest tie to a generous mind and I suspect you not of any baseness in your naturethough to be sure you have shewn a plentiful lack of wisdom in your conduct But misfortunes  make Solomons of us allAnd now Madam  to

William  Stop thereI won't be thankedI wish to do as I would be done by and as I should not like to be confined in the finest place in the world not even Woodley Park I would not impose such a restraint on one who I doubt not will hereafter merit my indulgence  L Mary  Gratitude overwhelms me SirI cannot speak my sense of your goodness as it deserves  Sir William  So much the betterThere are nobler ways of shewing one's sentiments  L Mary  They shall be demonstrated in my future conduct Sir for the virtue that arises from the conviction of past errors must be at once sincere and
