three Saxon Gods  Woden Thor  and  Freya  placed on pedestals  Enter  OSWALD  and  OSMOND  OSM  _'TIS time to hasten our mysterious rites  Because your army waits you  Osw    making three bows    Thor Freya  Woden all ye Saxon powers  Hear and revenge my father Hengist's death  Osm  Father of gods and men great Woden hear  Mount thy hot courser drive amidst thy foes  Lift high thy thund'ring arm let every blow hear  Dash out a misbelieving Briton's brains  Osw  Father of gods and men great Woden  Give conquest to the Saxon race and me  Osm  Thor Freya Woden hear and spell your Saxons  With sacred Runic rhymes from death in battle  Edge their bright swords and blunt th  Britons darts  Grimbald a fierce earthy spirit erises  No more great prince for see my trusty fiend  Who all the night has wing'd the dusky air  What news my Grimbald  Grim  I have play'd my part  For I have steel'd the fools that are to die  Six fools so prodigal of life and fool  That for their country they devote their lives  A sacrifice to mother Earth and Woden  Osm  'Tis well but are we sure of victory  Grim  Why ask'st thou me  Inspect their intrails draw from thence thy guess  Blood we must have without it we are dumb  Osm  Say where's thy fellowservant Philidel  Why comes not he  Grim  For he's a puling sprite  Why didst thou chuse a tender airy form  Unequal to the mighty work of mischief  His make is flitting soft and yielding atoms  He trembles at the yawning golph of hell  Nor dares approach the flame lest he should singe  His gaudy silken wings  He sighs when he should plunge a soul in sulphur  As with compassion touch'd of foolish man  Osm  What a half devil's he  His errand was to draw the lowland damps  And noisom vapours from the foggy fens  Then breathe the baleful stench with all his force  Full on the faces of our christen'd foes  Grim  Accordingly he drain'd those marshygrounds  And bagg'd 'em in a blue pestiferous cloud  Which when he shou'd have blown the frighted elf  Espy'd the redcross banners of their host  And said he durst not add to his damnation  Osm  I'll punish him at leisure  Call in the victims to propitiate hell  Grim  That's my kind master I shall breakfast on 'em    Exit Grim  Osw  Ambitious fools we are  And yet ambition is a godlike fault  Or rather 'tis no fault in souls born great  Who dare extend their glory by their deeds  Now Brittany prepare to change thy state  And from this day begin thy Saxon date  Grimbald reenters with six Saxons in white with swords in their hands priests and singers  SACRIFICE SONG  RECITATIVE I  Mr Champnes  Woden first to thee  A milkwhite steed in battle won  We have sacrific'd  Chor  We have sacrific'd  RECIT II  Mr Vernon  Let our next oblation be  To Thor thy thundering son  Of such another  Chor  We have sacrific'd  RECIT III  Mr Champnes  A third of Friezeland breed was he  To Woden's wife and to Thor's mother  And now we have aton'd all three  We have sacrific'd  Chor  We have sacrific'd  RECIT IV  Mr Vernon  The white horse neigh'd aloud  CHORUS  To Woden thanks we render  To Woden we have vow'd  To Woden our defender  RECIT V  Mrs Scot  The lot is cast and Tanfan pleas'd  Of mortal cares you shall be eas'd  CHORUS  Brave souls to be renown'd in story  Honour prizing  Death despising  Fame acquiring  By expiring  Die and reap the fruit of glory  AIR II  Mr Vernon  I call you all  To Woden's hall  Your temples round  With ivy bound  In goblets crown'd  And plenteous bowls of burnish'd gold  Where you shall laugh  And dance and quaff  The juice that makes the Britons bold  Chor  Brave souls c    All retire and the scene closes upon them  SCENE II  A landskip  Enter Aurelius Albanact and Conon  Con  this is the deciding day to fix  GreatBritain's scepter in great Arthur's hand  Aur  Or put it in the bold invader's gripe  Arthur and Oswald and their different fates  Are weighing now within the scales of heaven  Con  In ten set battles have we driven back  These heathen Saxons and regain'd our earth  As earth recovers from an ebbing tide  Her halfdrown'd face and lifts it o'er the waves  From Severn's bank e'en to this barren down  Our foremost men have press'd their fainty rear  And not one Saxon face has been beheld  But all their backs and shoulders have been stuck  With foul dishonest wounds now here indeed  Because they have no farther ground they stand  Aur  Well have we chose a happy day for fight  For every man in course of time has found  Some days are lucky some unfortunate  Alb  But why this day more lucky than the rest  Con  Because this day  Is sacred to the patron of our isle  A Christian and a soldier's annual feast  Alb  Oh now I understand you This is St George of Cappadocia's day Well it may be so but faith I was ignorant we soldiers seldom examine the Rubrick and now and then a saint may happen to slip by us but if he be a gentleman saint he will forgive us  Con  Oswald undoubtedly will fight it bravely  Aur  And it behoves him well 'tis his last stake But what manner of man is this Oswald Have ye ever seen him    To Alb  Alb  Ne'er but once and that was to my cost too I follow'd him too close and to say the truth  somewhat uncivilly upon a rout but he turned upon me as quick and as round as a chaf'd boar and gave me two licks across the face to put me in mind of my christianity  Con  I know him well he's free and openhearted  Aur  His country's character that speaks a German  Con  Revengeful rugged violently brave  And once resolv'd is never to be mov'd  Alb  Yes he's a valiant dog pox on him  Con  This was the character he then maintain'd  When in my court he sought my daughter's love  My fair blind Emmeline  Alb  I cannot blame him for courting the heiress of Cornwall all heiresses are beautiful and as blind as she is he would have had no blind bargain of her  Aur  For that defeat in love he rais'd this war  For royal Arthur reign'd within her heart  'Ere Oswald mov'd the suit  Con  Ay now Aurelius you have nam'd a man  One whom besides the homage that I owe  As Cornwall's duke to his imperial crown  I wou'd have chosen out from all mankind  To be my sovereign lord  Aur  His worth divides him from the croud of kings  Con  Arthur is all that's excellent in Oswald  And void of all his faults in battle brave  But still serene in all the stormy war  Like heaven above the clouds and after fight  As merciful and kind to vanquish'd foes  As a forgiving God But see he's here  And praise is dumb before him  Enter  King Arthur  reading a letter with attendants  Arth    reading    'Go on auspicious prince the stars are kind  'Unfold thy banners to the willing wind  'While I with airy legions help thy arms  'Confronting art with art and charms with charms'  So Merlin writes nor can we doubt th' event    To Con  With heav  and you our friends Oh noble Conon  You taught my tender hands the trade of war  And now again you helm your hoary head  And under double weight of age and arms  Assert your country's freedom and my crown  Con  No more my son  Arth  Most happy in that name  Your Emmeline to Oswald's vows resus'd  You made my plighted bride  Your charming daughter who like love born blind  Unaiming hits with surest archery  And innocently kills  Con  Remember son  You are a general other wars require you  For see the Saxon gross begins to move  Arth  Their infantry embattel'd square and close  March firmly on to fill the middle  pace  Cover'd by their advancing cavalry  By heav'n 'tis beauteous horror  The noble Oswald has provok'd my envy  Enter Emmeline led by Matilda  Ha now my beauteous Emmeline appears  A new but oh a softer flame inspires me  E'en rage and vengeance slumber at her sight  Con  Haste your farewell I'll chear my troops and wait ye    Exit Conon  Em  O father father I am sure you're here  Because I see your voice  Arth  No thou mistak'st thy hearing for thy sight  He's gone my Emmeline  And I but stay to gaze on those fair eyes  Which cannot view the conquest they have madeâ–ª  Oh starlike night dark only to thy sel    But full of glory as those lamps of heaven  That see not when they shine  Em  What is this heav'n and stars and night and day  To which you thus compare my eyes and me  I understand you when you say you love  For when my father clasps my hand in his  That's cold and I can feel it hard and wrinkled  But when you grasp it then I sigh and pant  And something presses to my heart  Arth  Oh artless love where the soul moves the tongue  And only nature speaks what nature thinks  Had she but eyes  Em  Just now you said I had  Arth  But neither see  Em  I'm sure they hear you then  What can your eyes do more  Arth  They view your beauties  Em  Do not I see you have a face like mine  Arth  It is not sight but touching with your hands  Em  Then 'tis my hand that sees and that's all one  For is not seeing touching with your eyes  Arth  No for I see at distance where I touch not  Em  If you can see so far and yet not touch  I fear you see my naked legs and feet  Quite through my clothes pray do not see so well  Arth  Fear not sweet innocence  I view the lovely features of your face  Your lips carnation your darkshaded eyebrows  Black eyes and snowwhite forehead all the colours  That make your beauty and produce my love  Em  Nay then you do not love on equal terms  I love you dearly without all these helps  I cannot see your lip's carnation  Your shaded eyebrows nor your milkwhite eyes  Arth  Alas 'tis vain t' instruct your innocence  You have no notion of light or colours    Trumpet souuds within  Em  Why is not that a trumpet  Arth  Yes  Em  I know it  And I cantell you how the sound on't looks  It looks as if it had an angry fighting face  Arth  'Tis now indeed a sharp unpleasant sound  Because it calls me hence from her I love  To meet ten thousand foes  Em  How does so many men e'er come to meet  This devil trumpet vexes 'em and then  They feel about for one another's faces  And so they meet and kill  Arth  I'll tell ye all when we have gain'd the field  One kiss of your fair hand the pledge of conquest  And so short a farewel    Kisses her hand and exit with  Aurel Alb  and attendants  Em  My heart and vows go with him to the fight  May every foe be that which they call blind  And none of all their swords have eyes to find him  But lead me nearer to the trumpet's face  For that brave sound upholds my fainting heart  And while I hear methinks I fight my part    Exit led by Matilda  SCENE III  A Camp Drums Trumpets and military Shouts  MARTIAL SONG  sung by Mr Vernon  Come if you dare our trumpets sound  Come if you dare the foes rebound  We come we come we come we come  Says the double double double beat of the thund'ring drum  Now they charge on amain  Now they rally again  The gods from above the mad labour behold  And pity mankind that will perish for gold  Cho  Now  arge c    Exeunt drums and  umpet a march  END of the FIRST ACT  ACT II SCENE I  A general Engagement between the Britons and Saxons in which the Britons are Conquerors  SCENE II  A Rural Prospect  Enter  Philidel  Phil  ALAS for pity of this bloody field  Piteous it needs must be when I a spirit  Can have so soft a sense of human woes  Ah for so many souls as but this morn  Were cloath'd with flesh and warm'd with vital blood  But naked now or shirted but with air  A SONG  O Peace sweet Peace descend  Of human woes the friend  O charm to rest this troubled isle  And o'er the land propitious smile  Thy smile can chase these clouds away  From darkest night bring forth the day  O Peace sweet Peace appear  And plant thy olive here  SCENE  draws and discovers Merlin's Cave  He comes forward  Mer  What art thou spirit of what name or order  For I have view'd thee in my magic glass  Making thy moan among the midnight wolves  That bay the silent moon speak I conjure thee  'Tis Merlin bids thee at whose awful wand  The pale ghost quivers and the grim fiend gasps  Phil  An airy shape the tend'rest of my kind  The last seduc'd and least deform'd of hell  Half white and shuffl'd in the crowd I fell  Desirous to repent and loth to sin  Aukward in mischief piteous of mankind  My name is Philidel my lot in air  Where next beneath the moon and nearest heav'n  I soar and have a glimpse to be receiv'd  For which the swarthy daemons envy me  Mer  Thy business here  Phil  To shun the Saxon wizard's dire commands  Osmond the awfull'st name next thine below  'Cause I refuse to hurl a noisom fog  On christen'd heads the hueandcry of hell  Is rais'd against me for a fugitive sprite  Mer  Osmond shall know a greater power protects thee  But follow then the whispers of thy soul  That draw thee nearer heav'n  And as thy place is nearest to the sky  The rays will reach thee first and bleach thy soot  Phil  In hope of that I spread my azure wings  And wishing still for yet I dare not pray  I bask in daylight and behold with joy  My scum work outward and my rust wear off  Mer  Why that's my hopeful spirit now mark me Philidel  I will employ thee for thy future good  Thou know'st in spite of valiant Oswald's arms  Or Osmond's powerful spells the field is ours  Phil  Oh master hasten  Thy dread commands for Grimbal  at hand  Osmond's fierce fiend I snuff his  rthy scent  The conquering Britons he misleads to rivers  Or dreadful downfalls of unheeded rocks  Where many fall that ne'er shall rise again  Mer  Be that thy care to stand by falls of brooks  And trembling bogs that bear a greensward show  Warn off the bold pursuers from the chace  No more they come and we divide the task  But lest fierce Grimbald's pond'rous bulk oppress  Thy tender flitting air I'll leave my band  Of spirits with united strength to aid thee  And force with force repel    Exeunt Merlin and Philidel into the cave  SCENE  a wood  Enter Grimbald and his followers disguised like shepherds leading king Arthur Conon Aurelius Albanact and attendants  Grim  Here this way Britons follow Oswald's flight  This evening as I whistled out my dog  To drive my straggling flock and pitch'd my fold  I saw him dropping sweat o'erlabour'd stiff  Make faintly as he could to yonder dell  Tread in my steps long neighbourhood by day  Has made these fields familiar in the night  Arth  I thank thee shepherd  Expect reward lead on we follow thee

led by Matilda  Em  No news of my dear love or of my father  Mat  None madam since the gaining of the battle  Great Arthur is a royal conqueror now  And well deserves your love  Em  But now I fear  He'll be too great to love poor silly me  If he be dead or never come again  I mean to die but there's a greater doubt  Since I ne'er saw him here  How shall I meet him in another world  Mat  Indeed I know not  Em  I should find him  For surely I have seen him in my sleep  And then methought he put his mouth to mine  And eat a thousand kisses on my lips  Sure by his kissing I could find him out  Among a thousand angels in the sky  Mat  But what a kind of man do you suppose him  Em  He must be made of the most precious things  And I believe his mouth and eyes and cheeks  And nose and all his face are made of gold  Mat  Heav'n bless us madam what a face you make him  If it be yellow he must have the jaundice  And that's a bad disease  Em  Why then do lovers give a thing so bad  As gold to women whom so well they love  Mat  Because that bad thing gold buys all good things  Em  Yet I must know him better of all colours  Tell me which is the purest and the softest  Mat  They say 'tis black  Em  Why then since gold is hard and yet is precious  His face must all be made of soft black gold  Mat  But madam  Em  No more I have learn'd enough for once  Mat  Here are a crew of Kentish lads and lasses  Wou'd entertain you till your lord's return  With songs and dances to divert your cares  Em  O bring 'em in  For tho' I cannot see the songs I love 'em  And love they tell me is a dance of hearts  Enter Kentish Lads and Lasses  SONG  Sung by Mr Vernon  I  How blest are shepherds how happy their lasses  While drums and trumpets are sounding alarms  Over our lowly sheds all the storm passes  And when we die 'tis in each others arms  All the day on our herds and flocks employing  All the night on our flutes and in enjoying  Chor  All the day  c  II  Bright Nymphs of Britain with graces attended  Let not your days without pleasure expire  Honour's but empty and when youth is ended  All men will praise you but none will desire  Let not youth fly away without contenting  Age will come time enough for your repenting  Chor  Let not youth  c  DUETTO  Mrs Scott and Mrs Dorman  Shepherds shepherds leave decoying  Pipes are sweet a summer's day  But a little after toying  Women have the s  ot to pay  II  Here are marriage vows for signing  Set their marks that cannot write  After that without repining  Play and welcome day and night  CHORUS  Come shepherds lead up a lively measure  The  of wedlock are c  res  pleasure  But whether marriage bring joy or sorrow  Make sure of this day and hang tomorrow    They dance after the song and  exeunt  shepherds and shepherdesses  Enter on the other side of the Stage Oswald and Guillamar  Osw  The night has wilder'd us and we are fall'n  Among their formost tents  Guil  Ha what are these  They seem of more than vulgar quality  Em  What sounds are those They cannot far be distant  Where are we now Matilda  Mat  Just before your tent  Fear not they must be friends and they approach  Em  My Arthur speak my love are you return'd  To bless your Emmelice  Osw    to Guilla    I know that face  'Tis the ungrateful fair who scorning mine  Accepts my rival's love heaven thou'rt bounteous  Thou ow'st me nothing now  Mat  Fear grows upon me  Speak what you are speak or I call for help  Osw  We are your guards  Mat  Ah me we are betray'd 'tis Oswald's voice  Em  Let them not see our voices and then they cannot find

 Your Britons cannot help you  This arm thro' all their troops shall force my way  Yet neither quit my honour nor my prey    Exeunt the women still crying    An alarm within and a cry of  Follow

the clutches of your foes  Blasts all our laurelsa hundred victories  Will not half pay the loss of Emmeline  We are outwitted by the Saxons  But 'tis no wonder the whole camp's debauch'd  All drunk or whoringthis way  Enter an Officer  Offic  How sits the conquest on great Arthur's brow  Alb  As when the lover with the king is mixt  He puts the gain of Britain in a scale  Which weighing with the loss of Emmeline  He thinks he's scarce a saver    Trumpet within  Offic  Hark a trumpet  It sounds a parley  Alb  'Tis from Oswald then  An echo to king Arthur's friendly summons  Sent since he heard

Arthur on one side attended Oswald on the other with attendants and Guillamar They meet and salute  Arth  Brave Oswald We have met on friendlier terms  Companions of a war with common interest  Against the bordering Picts but times are chang'd  Osw  And I am sorry that those times are chang'd  For else we now might meet on terms as friendly  Arth  If so we meet not now the fault's your own  For you have wrong'd me much  Osw  Oh you wou'd tell me  I call'd more Saxons in t'enlarge my bounds  If those be wrongs the war has well redress'd ye  Arth  Mistake me not I count not war a wrong  War is the trade of kings that fight for empire  And better be a lion than a sheep  Osw  In what then have I wrong'd ye  Arth  In my love  Osw  Even love's an empire too the noble soul  Like kings is covetous of single sway  Arth  I blame ye not for loving Emmeline  But since the soul is free and love is choice  You should have made a conquest of her mind  And not have forc'd her person by a rape  Osw  Whether by force or stratagem we gain  Still gaining is our end in war or love  Her mind's the jewel in her body lock'd  If I would gain the gem and want the key  It follows I must seize the cabinet  But to secure your fear her honour is untouch'd  Arth  Was honour ever safe in brutal hands  So safe are lambs within the lion's paw  Ungripp'd and play'd with till fierce hunger calls  Then nature shews itself the closehid nails  Are stretch'd and open to the panting prey  But if indeed you are so cold a lover  Osw  Not cold but honourable  Arth  Then restore her  That done I shall believe you honourable  Osw  Think'st thou I will forgo a victor's right  Arth  Say rather of an impious ravisher  That castle were it wall'd with adamant  Can hide thy head but till tomorrow's dawn  Osw  And ere tomorrow I may be a god  If Emmeline be kind but kind or cruel  I tell thee Arthur but to see this day  That heavenly face tho' not to have her mine  I would give up a hundred years of life  And bid Fate cut tomorrow  Arth  It soon will come and thou repent too late  Which to prevent I'll bribe thee to be honest  Thy noble head accustom'd to a crown  Shall wear it still nor shall thy hand forget  The scepter's use from Medway's pleasing stream  To Severn's roar be thine  In short restore my love and share my kingdom  Osw  Not tho' you spread my sway from Thames to Tiber  Such gifts might bribe a king but not a lover  Arth  Then pr'ythee give me back my kingly word  Pass'd for thy safe return and let this hour  In single combat hand in hand decide  The fate of empire and of Emmeline  Osw  Not that I fear do I decline this combat  And not decline it neither but defer  When Emmeline has been my prize as long  As she was thine I dare thee to the duel  Arth  I nam'd your utmost term of life tomorrow  Osw  You are not fate  Arth  But fate is in this arm  You might have made a merit of your theft  Osw  Ha theft Your guards can tell I stole her not  Arth  Had I been present  Osw  Had you been present she had been mine more nobly  Arth  There lies your way  Osw  My way lies where I please  Expect for Osmond's magic cannot fail  A long tomorrow ere your arms prevail  Or if I fall make room ye blest above  For one who was undone and dy'd for love    Exit Oswald and his party  Arth  There may be one black minute e'er tomorrow  For who can tell what power

discover with the dawn  Yon southern hill which promis'd to the sight  A rise more easy to attack the fort  Scarce had we stept on the forbidden ground  When the woods shook the trees stood bristling up  A living trembling nodded thro' the leaves  Arth  Poplars and aspenboughs a panic fright  Con  We thought so too and doubled still our pace  But strait a rumbling sound like bellowing winds  Rose and grew loud confus'd with howls of wolves  And grunts of bears and dreadful hiss of snakes  Shrieks more than human globes of hail pour'd down  An armed winter and inverted day  Arth  Dreadful indeed  Aur  Count then our labours lost  For other way lies none to mount the cliff  Unless we borrow wings and sail thro' air  Arth  Now I perceive a danger worthy me  'Tis Osmond's work a band of hellhir'd slaves  Be mine the hazard mine shall be the fame    Arthur going out is met by Merlin who takes him by the hand and brings him back  Enter Merlin  Mer  Hold Sir and wait Heav'n's time th' attempt's too dangerous  There's not a tree in that enchanted grove  But number'd out and giv'n by tale to fiends  And under every leaf a spirit couch'd  But by what method to dissolve these charms  Is yet unknown to me  Arth  Hadst thou been here for what can thwart thy skill  Nor Emmeline had been the boast of Oswald  Nor I forewarn'd been wanting to her guard  Con  Her darken'd eyes had seen the light of Heav'n  That was thy promise too and this the time  Mer  Nor has my aid been absent tho' unseen  With friendly guides in your benighted maze  Nor Emmeline shall longer want the sun  Arth  Is there an end of woes  Mer  There is and sudden  I have employ'd a subtle airy sprite  T' explore the passage and prepare thy way  Myself mean time will view the magic wood  To learn whereon depends its force  Con  But Emmeline  Mer  Fear not this vial shall restore her sight  Arth  Oh might I hope and what's impossible  To Merlin's art to be myself the bearer  That with the light of Heav'n she may discern  Her lover first  Mer  'Tis wond'rous hazardous  Yet I foresee th' event 'tis fortunate  I'll bear ye safe and bring ye back unharm'd  Then lose not precious time but follow me    Exeunt

o'er the names and schools the tardy sprites  His absence gives me more security  At every walk I pass'd I drew a spell  So that if any fiend abhorring Heav'n  There sets his foot it roots him to the
