 Eloisa to Abelard  ELOISA TO ABELARD  Written by Mr POPE  The SECOND EDITION  LONDON  Printed for BERNARD LINTOT at the  CrossKeys  between the  TempleGates  in  FleetStreet  MDCCXX  The ARGUMENT  ABelard  and  Eloisa  flourish'd in the twelsth Century they were two of the most dislinguish'd persons of their age in learning and beauty but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate passon After a long course of calamities they retired each to a several Convent and consecrated the remainder of their days to religion It was many years after this separation that a letter of  Abelard  's to a friend which contain'd the history of his misfortunes fell into the hands of  Eloisa  This awakening all her tenderness occasion'd those celebrated letters out of which the following is partly extracted which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature virtue and passion  ELOISA TO ABELARD  _IN these deep solitudes and awful cells  Where heav'nly pensive contemplation dwells  And evermusing melancholy reigns  What means this tumult in a Vestal's veins  Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat  Vhy feels my heart its longforgotten heat  Yet yet I loveFrom  Abelard  it came  And  Eloisa  yet must kiss the name  Dear fatal name rest ever unreveal'd  Nor pass these lips in holy silence seal'd  Hide it my heart within that close disguise  Where mix'd with God's his lov'd Idea lies  Oh write it not my handThe name appears  Already writtenwash it out my tears  In vain lost  Eloisa  weeps and prays  Her heart still dictates and her hand obeys  Relentless walls whose darksom round contains  Repentant sighs and voluntary pains  Ye rugged rocks which holy knees have worn  Ye grots and caverns shagg'd with horrid thorn  Shrines where their vigils paleey'd virgins keep  And pitying saints whose statues learn to weep  Tho' cold like you unmov'd and silent grown  I have not yet forgot my self to stone  Heav'n claims me all in vain while he has part  Still rebel nature holds out half my heart  Nor pray'rs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain  Nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain  Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose  That wellknown name awakens all my woes  O name for ever sad for ever dear  Still breath'd in sighs still usher'd with a tear  I tremble too wheree'er my own I find  Some dire misfortune follows close behind  Line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow  Led thro' a sad variety of woe  Now warm in love now with'ring in thy bloom  Lost in a convent's solitary gloom  There stern religion quench'd th' unwilling flame  There dy'd the best of passions Love and Fame  Yet write oh write me all that I may join  Griefs to thy griess and echo sighs to thine  Nor foes nor fortune take this pow'r away  And is my  Abelard  less kind than they  Tears still are mine and those I need not spare  Love but demands what else were shed in pray'r  No happier task these faded eyes pursue  To read and weep is all they now can do  Then share thy pain allow that sad relief  Ah more than share it give me all thy grief  Heav'n first taught letters for some wretches aid  Some banish'd lover or some captive maid  They live they speak they breathe what love inspires  Warm from the soul and faithful to its fires  The virgins wish without her fears impart  Excuse the blush and pour out all the heart  Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul  And waft a sigh from  Indus  to the  Pole  Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame  When Love approach'd me under Friendfhip's name  My fancy form'd thee of Angelick kind  Some emanation of th' allbeauteous Mind  Those smiling eyes attemp'ring ev'ry ray  Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day  Guiltless I gaz'd heav'n listen'd while you sung  And truths  He was her Preceptor in Philosophy and Divinity  divine came mended from that tongue  From lips like those what precept fail'd to move  Too soon they taught me 'twas no sin to love  Back thro' the paths of pleasing sense I ran  Nor wish'd an Angel whom I lov'd a Man  Dim and remote the joys of saints I fee  Nor envy them that heav'n I lose for thee  How oft' when press'd to marriage have I said  Curse on all laws but those which love has made  Love free as air at sight of human ties  Spreads his light wings and in a moment flies  Let wealth let honour wait the wedded dame  August her deed and sacred be her fame  Before true passion all thofe views remove  Fame wealth and honour what are you to Love  The jealous God when we profane his fires  Those restless passions in revenge inspires  And bids them make mistaken mortals groan  Who seek in love for ought but love alone  Should at my feet the world's great master fall  Himself his throne his world I'd scorn 'em all  Not  Caesar  's empress wou'd I deign to prove  No make me mistress to the man I love  If there be yet another name more free  More fond than mistress make me that to thee  O happy state when souls each other draw  When love is liberty and nature law  All then is full possessing and possest  No craving Void left aking in the breast  Ev'n thought meets thought e'er from the lips it part  And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart  This sure is bliss if bliss on earth there be  And once the lot of  Abelard  and me  Alas how chang'd what sudden horrors rise  A naked Lover bound and bleeding lies  Where where was  Eloise  her voice her hand  Her ponyard had oppos'd the dire command  Barbarian stay that bloody hand restrain  The crime was common common be the pain  I can no more by shame by rage supprest  Let tears and burning blushes speak the rest  Canst thou forget that sad that solcmn day  When victims at yon' altar's foot we lay  Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell  When warm in youth I bade the world farewell  As with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil  The shrines all trembled and the lamps grew pale  Heav'n scarce believ'd the conquest it survey'd  And Saints with wonder heard the vows I made  Yet then to those dread altars as I drew  Not on the Cross my eyes were fix'd but you  Not grace or zeal love only was my call  And if I lose thy love I lose my all  Come with thy looks thy words relieve my woe  Those still at least are left thee to bestow  Still on that breast enamour'd let me lie  Still drink delicious poison from thy eye  Pant on thy lip and to thy heart be prest  Give all thou canstand let me dream the rest  Ah no instruct me other joys to prize  With other beauties charm my partial eyes  Full in my view set all the bright abode  And make my soul quit  Abelard  for God  Ah think at least thy flock deserve thy care  Plants of thy hand and children of thy pray'r  From the false world in early youth they fled  By thee to mountains wilds and deserts led  You  He founded the Monastery  rais'd these hallow'd walls the desert smil'd  And Paradise was open'd in the Wild  No weeping orphan saw his father's stores  Our shrines irradiate or emblaze the floors  No silver saints by dying misers giv'n  Here brib'd the rage of illrequited heav'n  But such plain roofs as piety could raise  And only vocal with the Maker's praise  In these lone walls their days eternal bound  These mossgrown domes with spiry turrets crown'd  Where awful arches make a noonday night  And the dim windows shed a solemn light  Thy eyes diffus'd a reconciling ray  And gleams of glory brighten'd all the day  But now no face divine contentment wears  'Tis all blank fadness or continual tears  See how the force of others pray'rs I try  Oh pious fraud of am'rous charity  But why should I on others pray'rs depend  Come thou my father brother husband friend  Ah let thy handmaid sister daughter move  And all those tender names in one thy love  The darksom pines that o'er yon' rocks reclin'd  Wave high and murmur to the hollow wind  The wand'ring streams that shine between the hills  The grots that echo to the tinkling rills  The dying gales that pant upon the trees  The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze  No more these scenes my meditation aid  Or lull to rest the visionary maid  But o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves  Longfounding isles and intermingled graves  Black Melancholy sits and round her throws  A deathlike silence and a dread repose  Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene  Shades ev'ry flow'r and darkens ev'ry green  Deepens the murmur of the falling floods  And breathes a browner horror on the woods  Yet here for ever ever must I stay  Sad proof how well a lover can obey  Death only death can break the lasting chain  And here ev'n then shall my cold dust remain  Here all its frailties all its flames resign  And wait 'till 'tis no sin to mix with thine  Ah wretch believ'd the spouse of God in vain  Confess'd within the slave of love and man  Assist me heav'n but whence arose that pray'r  Sprung it from piety or from despair  Ev'n here where frozen chastity retires  Love finds an altar for forbidden fires  I ought to grieve but cannot what I ought  I mourn the lover not lament the fault  I view my crime but kindle at the view  Repent old pleasures and sollicit new  Now turn'd to heav'n I weep my past offence  Now think of thee and curse my innocence  Of all affliction taught a lover yet  'Tis sure the hardesl science to forget  How shall I lose the sin yet keep the sense  And love th' offender yet detest th' offence  How the dear object from the crime remove  Or how distinguish penitence from love  Unequal task a passion to resign  For hearts so touch'd so pierc'd so lost as mine  E'er such a soul regains its peaceful state  How often must it love how often hate  How often hope despair resent regret  Conceal disdaindo all things but forget  But let heav'n seize it all at once 'tis fir'd  Not touch'd but rapt not waken'd but inspir'd  Oh come oh teach me nature to subdue  Renounce my love my life my selfand you  Fill my fond heart with God alone for he  Alone can rival can succeed to thee  How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot  The world forgetting by the world forgot  Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind  Each pray'r accepted and each wish resign'd  Labour and rest that equal periods keep  ' Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep  Desires compos'd affections ever even  Tears that delight and sighs that waft to heav'n  Grace shines around her with serenest beams  And whisp'ring Angels prompt her golden dreams  For her the Spouse prepares the bridal ring  For her white virgins  Hymenaeals  sing  For her th' unfading Rose of  Eden  blooms  And wings of Seraphs shed divine perfumes  To founds of heav'nly harps she dies away  and melts in visions of eternal day  Far other dreams my erring soul employ  Far other raptures of unholy joy  When at the close of each sad sorrowing day  Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away  Then conscience sleeps and leaving nature free  All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee  O curst dear horrors of allconscious night  How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight  Provoking Daemons all restraint remove  And stir within me ev'ry source of love  I hear thee view thee gaze o'er all thy charms  And round thy phantom glue my clasping arms  I wakeno more I hear no more I view  The phantom flies me as unkind as you  I call aloud it hears not what I say  I stretch my empty arms it glides away  To dream once more I close my willing eyes  Ye soft illusions dear deceits arise  Alas no moremethinks we wandring go  Thro' dreary wastes and weep each other's woe  Where round some mould'ring tow'r pale ivy creeps  And lowbrow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps  Sudden you mount you becken from the skies  Clouds interpose waves roar and winds arise  I shriek start up the same sad prospect find  And wake to all the griefs I left behind  For thee the fates severely kind ordain  A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain  Thy life a long dead calm of fix'd repose  No pulse that riots and no blood that glows  Still as the sea e'er winds were taught to blow  Or moving Spirit bade the waters flow  Soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiv'n  And mild as opening gleams of promis'd heav'n  Come  Abelard  for what hast thou to dread  The torch of  Venus  burns not for the dead  Cut from the root my perish'd joys I see  And love's warm tyde for ever stopt in thee  Nature stands check'd Religion disapproves  Ev'n thou art coldyet  Eloisa  loves  Ah hopeless lasting flames like those that burn  To light the dead and warm th' unfruitful urn  What scenes appear wheree'er I turn my view  The dear Ideas where I fly pursue  Rise in the grove before the altar rise  Stain all my soul and wanton in my eyes  I waste the Matin lamp in sighs for thee  Thy image steals between my God and me  Thy voice I seem in ev'ry hymn to hear  With ev'rv bead I drop too soft a tear  When from the Censer clouds of flagrance roll  And swelling organs lift the rising soul  One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight  Priestis Tapers Temples swim before my fight  In seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd  While Altars blaze and Angels tremble round  While prostrate here in humble grief I lie  Kind virtuous drops just gath'ring in my eye  While praying trembling in the dust I roll  And dawning grace is opening on my soul  Come if thou dar'st all charming as thou art  Oppose thy self to heav'n dispute my heart  Come with one glance of those deluding eyes  Blot out each bright Idea of the skies  Take back that grace those sorrows and those tears  Take back my fruitless penitence and pray'rs  Snatch me just mounting from the blest abode  Assit the Fiends and tear me from my God  No fly me fly me far as Pole from Pole  Rise  Alps  between us and whole oceans roll  Ah come not write not think not once of me  Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee  Thy oaths I quit thy memory resign  Forget renounce me hate whate'er was mine  Fair eyes and tempting looks which yet I view  Long lov'd ador'd ideas all adieu  O grace serene oh virtue heav'nly fair  Divine oblivion of lowthoughted care  Fresh blooming hope gay daughter of the sky  And faith our early immortality  Enter each mild each amicable guest  Receive and wrap me in eternal rest  See in her Cell sad  Eloisa  spread  Propt in some tomb a neighbour of the dead  In each low wind methinks a spirit calls  And more than echoes talk along the walls  Here as I watch'd the dying lamps around  From yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound  Come sister come it said or seem'd to say  Thy place is here sad sister come away  Once like thy self I trembled wept and pray'd  Love's victim then tho' now a sainted maid  But all is calm in this eternal sleep  Here grief forgets to groan and love to weep  Ev'n superstition loses ev'ry fear  For God not man absolves our frailties here  I come ye ghosts prepare your roseate bow'rs  Celestial palms and ever blooming flow'rs  Thither where sinners may have rest I go  Where flames refin'd in breasts seraphic glow  Thou  Abelard  the last sad office pay  And smooth my passage to the realms of day  See my lips tremble and my eyeballs roll  Suck my last breath and catch the flying soul  Ah noin sacred vestments may'st thou stand  The hallow'd taper trembling in thy hand  Present the Cross before my lifted eye  Teach me at once and learn of me to die  Ah then thy oncelov'd  Eloisa  see  It will be then no crime to gaze on me  See from my cheek the transient roses fly  See the last sparkle languish in my eye  Till ev'ry motion pulse and breath be o'er  And ev'n my  Abelard  belov'd no more  O death alleloquent you only prove  What dust we doat on when 'tis man we love  Then too when fate shall thy fair frame destroy  That cause of all my guilt and all my joy  In trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drown'd  Bright clouds descend and Angels watch thee round  From opening skies may streaming glories shine  And Saints embrace thee with a love like mine  May  Abelard  and  Eloisa  were interr'd in the same grave or in Monuments adjoining in the Monastery of the  Paraclete  He died in the year she in  one kind grave unite each hapless name  And graft my love immortal on thy same  Then ages hence when all my woes are o'er  When this rebellious heart shall beat no more  If ever chance two wandring lovers brings  To  Paraclete  's white walls and silver springs  O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads  And drink the falling tears each other sheds  Then sadly say with mutual pity mov'd  Oh may we never love as these have lov'd  From the full quire when loud  Hosanna  's rise  And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice  Amid that scene if some relenting eye  Glance on the stone where our cold reliques lie  Devotion's self shall steal a thought from heav'n  One human tear shall drop and be forgiv'n  And sure if fate some future Bard shall join  In sad similitude of griefs to mine  Condemn'd whole years in absence to deplore  And image charms he must behold no more  Such if there be who loves so long so well  Let him our sad our tender story tell  The wellsung woes shall sooth my pensive ghost  He best can paint 'em who shall feel 'em most  VERSES TO THE MEMORY OF AN UNFORTUNATE LADY  VERSES TO THE MEMORY OF AN UNFORTUNATE LADY  _WHAT beck'ning ghost along the moonlight shade  Invites my steps and points to yonder glade  'Tis shebut why that bleeding bosom gor'd  Why dimly gleams the visionary sword  Oh ever beauteous ever friendly tell  Is it in heav'n a crime to love too well  To bear too tender or too firm a heart  To act a Lover's or a  Roman  's part  Is there no bright reversion in the sky  For those who greatly think or bravely die  Why bade ye else ye Pow'rs her soul aspire  Above the vulgar flight of low desire  Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes  The glorious fault of Angels and of Gods  Thence to their Images on earth it flows  And in the breasts of Kings and Heroes glows  Most souls 'tis true but peep out once an age  Dull sullen pris'ners in the body's cage  Dim lights of life that burn a length of years  Useless unseen as lamps in sepulchres  Like Eastern Kings a lazy state they keep  And close confin'd in their own palace sleep  From these perhaps e'er nature bade her die  Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky  As into air the purer spirits flow  And sep'rate from their kindred dregs below  So flew the soul to its congenial place  Nor left one virtue to redeem her Race  But thou false guardian of a charge too good  Thou mean deserter of thy brother's blood  See on these ruby lips the trembling breath  These cheeks now fading at the blast of death  Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before  And those lovedarting Eyes must roll no more  Thus if eternal justice rules the ball  Thus shall your wives and thus your children fall  On all the line a sudden vengeance waits  And frequent herses shall besiege your gates  There passengers shall stand and pointing say  While the long fun'rals blacken all the way  Lo these were they whose souls the Furies steel'd  And curs'd with hearts unknowing how to yield  Thus unlamented pass the proud away  The gaze of fools and pageant of a day  So perish all whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow  For others good or melt at others woe  What can atone oh everinjur'd shade  Thy fate unpity'd and thy rites unpaid  No friend's complaint no kind domnestic tear  Pleas'd thy pale ghost or grac'd thy mournful bier  By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd  By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd  By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd  By strangers honour'd and by strangers mourn'd  What tho' no friends in sable weeds appear  Grieve for an hour perhaps then mourn a year  And bear about the mockery of woe  To midnight dances and the publick show  What tho' no weeping Loves thy ashes grace  Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face  What tho' no sacred earth allow the room  Nor hallow'd dirge be utter'd o'er thy tomb  Yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest  And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast  There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow  There the first roses of the year shall blow  While Angels with their silver wings o'ershade  The ground now sacred by thy reliques made  So peaceful rests without a stone a name  What once had beauty titles wealth and fame  How lov'd how honour'd once avails thee not  To whom related or by whom begot  A heap of dust alone remains of thee  'Tis all thou art and all the proud shall be  Poets themselves must fall like those they sung  Deaf the prais'd ear and mute the tuneful tongue  Ev'n he whose soul now melts in mournful lays  Shall shortly want the gen'rous tear he pays  Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part  And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart  Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er  The Muse forgot and thou belov'd no more  FLORELIO  A PASTORAL  Lamenting the Death of the late Marquis of  BLANDFORD  By Mr FENTON  _ASK not the cause why all the tuneful swains  Who us'd to fill the vales with tender Strains  In deep despair neglect the warb'ling reed  And all their bleating flocks refuse to feed  Ask not why greens and flow'rs so late appear  To cloath the glebe and deck the springing year  Why sounds the lawn with loud laments and cries  And swoln with tears to floods the Riv'lets rise  The fair  Florelio  now has left the plain  And is the grief who was the grace of ev'ry  British  swain  For thee lov'd youth on ev'ry vale and lawn  The nymphs and all thy fellowshepherds moan  The little birds now cease to sing and love  Silent they sit and droop on ev'ry grove  No mounting lark now warbles on the wing  Nor Linnets chirp to chear the sullen spring  Only the melancholy Turtles coo  And  Philomel  by night repeats her woe  O charmer of the shades the tale prolong  Nor let the morning interrupt thy song  Or softly tune thy tender notes to mine  Forgetting  Tereus  make my sorrows thine  Now the dear youth has left the lonely plain  And is the grief who was the grace of ev'ry  British  swain  Say all ye shades where late he us'd to rest  If e'er your beds with lovelier swain were prest  Say all ye silver streams if e'er ye bore  The image of so fair a face before  But now ye streams assist me whilst I mourn  For never must the lovely swain return  And as these flowing tears increase your tide  O murmur for the shepherd as ye glide  Be sure ye rocks while I my grief disclose  Let your sad echo's lengthen out my woes  Ye breezes bear the plaintive accents on  And whisp'ring tell the woods  Florelio  's gone  For ever gone and left the lonely plain  And is the grief who was the grace of ev'ry  British  swain  Ripe strawberries for thee and peaches grew  Sweet to the taste and tempting red to view  For thee the rose put sweeter purple on  Preventing by her haste the summersun  But now the flow'rs all pale and blighted lie  And in cold sweats of sickly mildew die  Nor can the bees suck from the shrivel'd blooms  Aetherial sweets to store their golden combs  Ort' on thy lips they would their labours leave  And sweeter odours from thy mouth receive  Sweet as the breath of  Flora  when she lies  In jesmin shades and for young  Zephyr  sighs  But now those lips are cold relentless death  Hath chill'd their Charms and stop'd thy balmy breath  Those eyes where  Cupid  tipp'd his darts with fire  And kindled in the coldest nymphs desire  Robb'd of their beams in everlasting night  Are clos'd and give us woe as once delight  And thou dear youth hast left the lonely plain  And art the grief who wert the grace of ev'ry  British  swain  As in his bow'r the dying shepherd lay  The shepherd yet so young and once so gay  The nymphs that swim the stream and range the wood  And haunt the flow'ry meads around him stood  There tears down each fair cheek unbounded fell  And as he gasp'd they gave a sad farewel  Softly they cry'd as sleeping flow'rs  By night be thy dear eyes by  A gentle fall may thy young beauties have  And golden slumbers wait thee in thy grave  Yearly thy hearse with garlands we'll adorn  And teach young nightingales for thee to mourn  Bees love the blooms the flocks the bladed grain  Nor less wert thou belov'd by ev'ry swain  Come shepherds come perform the fun'ral due  For he was ever good and kind to you  On ev'ry smoothest beech in ev'ry grove  In weeping characters record your love  And as in mem'ry of  Adoms  slain  When for the youth the  Syrian  maids complain  His river to record the guilty day  With freshly bleeding purple stains the sea  So thou dear  Cam  contribute to our woe  And bid thy stream in plaintive murmurs flow  Thy head with thy own willow boughs adorn  And with thy tears supply the frugal urn  The swains their sheep the nymphs shall leave the lawn  And yearly on their banks renew their moan  His mother while they there lament shall be  The queen of love the lov'd  Adonis  he  On her like  Venus  all the  Graces  wait  And he too like  Adonis  in his fate  For fresh in fragrant youth he left the plain  And is the grief who was the grace of ev'ry  British  swain  No more the nymphs that o'er the brooks preside  Dress their gay beauties by the crystal tide  Nor fly the wintry winds nor scorching sun  Now he for whom they strove to charm is gone  Oft' they beneath their reedy coverts sigh'd  And look'd and long'd and for  Florelio  dy'd  Of him they sang and with soft ditties strove  To sooth the pleasing agonies of love  But now they roam distracted with despair  And cypress twin'd with mournful willows wear  Thus hand in hand around his grave they go  And saffion buds and fading lillies strow  With sprigs of myrtle mix'd and scatt'ring cry  So sweet and soft the shepherd was so soon decreed to die  There fresh in dear remembrance of their woes  His name the young  Anemonies  disclose  Nor strange they should a double grief avow  Then  Venus  wept and  Pastorella  now  Breathe soft ye winds long let them paint the plain  Unhurt untouch'd by ev'ry passing swain  And when ye nymphs to make the garlands gay  With which ye crown the mistress of the  May  Ye shall these flow'rs to bind her temples take  O pluck them gently for  Florelio  's sake  And when thro'  Woodstock  's green retreats ye stray  Or  Altrop  's flow'ry vales invite to play  O'er which young  Pastorella  's beauties bring  Elyzium  early and improve the spring  When ev'ning gales attentive silence keep  And heav'n its balmy dew begins to weep  By the soft fall of ev'ry warbling stream  Sigh your said airs and bless the shepherd's name  There to the tender lute attune your woe  While hyacinths and myrtles round you grow  So may  Sylvanus  ever 'tend your bow'rs  And  Zephyr  brush the mildew from the flow'rs  Bid all the swans from  Cam  and  Isis  haste  In the melodious quire to breath their last  O  Colin    Colin  cou'd I there complain  Like thee when young  Philisides  was slain  Thou sweet frequenter of the muse's stream  Why have I not thy voice or thou my theme  Tho' weak my voice tho' lowly be my lays  They shall be sacred to the shepherd's praise  To him my voice to him my lays belong  And bright  Myrtilla  now must live unsung  Ev'n she whose artless beauty bless'd me more  Than ever swain was bless'd by nymph before  While ev'ry tender sigh to seal our bliss  Brought a kind vow and ev'ry vow a kiss  Fair chaste and kind yet now no more can move  So much my grief is stronger than my love  Now the dear youth has left the lonely plain  And is the grief who was the grace of ev'ry  British  swain  As when some cruel hind has born away  The turtle's nest and made the yuung his prey  Sad in her native grove she sits alone  There hangs her wings and murmurs out her moan  So the bright shepherdess who bore the boy  Beneath a baleful yew does weeping lie  Nor can the fair the weighty woe sustain  But bends like roses crush'd with falling rain  Nor from the silent earth her eyes removes  That weeping languish like a dying dove's  Not such her look severe reverse of fate  When little  loves  in ev'ry dimple sate  And all the  smiles  delighted to resort  On the calm heav'n of her soft cheeks to sport  Soft as the clouds mild  April  ev'nings wear  Which drop fresh flourets on the youthful year  The fountain's fall can't lull her wakeful woes  Nor poppygarlands give the nymph repose  Thro' prickly brakes and unfrequented groves  O'er hills and dales and craggy cliffs she roves  And when she spies beneath some silent shade  The daisies press'd where late his limbs were laid  To the cold print there close she joins her face  And all with gushing tears bedews the grass  There with loud plaints she wounds the pitying skies  And oh return my lovely youth she cries  Return  Florelio  with thy wonted charms  Fill the soft circles of my longing arms  Cease fair affliction cease the lovely boy  In death's cold arms must pale and breathless lie  The fates can never change their first decree  Or sure they would have chang'd this one for thee  Pan  for his  Syrinx  makes eternal moan  Ceres  her daughter lost and thou thy son  The son for ever now has left the plain  And is the grief who was the grace of ev'ry  British  swain  Adieu ye mossy caves and shady groves  Once happy scenes of our successful loves  Ye hungry herds and bleating flocks adieu  Flints be your beds and browze the bitter yew  Two lambs alone shall be my charge to feed  For yearly on his grave two lambs shall bleed  This pledge of lasting love dear shade receive  'Tis all alas a shepherd's love can give  But grief from its own pow'r will set me free  Will send me soon a willing ghost to thee  Cropt in the flow'ry spring of youth I'll go  With hasty joy to wait thy shade below  In everfragrant meads and jesminbow'rs  We'll dwell and all  Elyzium  shall be ours  Where citron groves aetherial odours breath  And streams of flowing crystal purl beneath  Where all are everyoung and heav'nly fair  As here above thy sister  graces  are  UPON THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND  By Mrs ELIZABETH SINGER  _IN what soft language shall my thoughts get free  My dear  Alexis  when I talk of thee  Ye muses graces all ye gentle train  Of weeping loves assist the pensive strain  But why should I implore your moving art  'Tis but to speak the dictates of my heart  And all that knew the charming youth will join  Their friendly sighs and pious tears to mine  For all that knew his merit must confess  In grief for him there can be no excess  His soul was form'd to act each glorious part  Of life unstain'd with vanity or art  No thought within his gen'rous mind had birth  But what he might have own'd to heaven and earth  Practis'd by him each virtue grew more bright  And shone with more than its own native light  Whatever noble warmth could recommend  The just the active and the constant friend  Was all his own but oh a dearer name  And softer tyes my endless sorrow claim  Lost in despair distracted and forlorn  The lover I and tender husband mourn  Whate'er to such superior worth was due  Whate'er excess the fondest passion knew  I felt for thee dear youth my joys my care  My prayers themselves were thine and only where  Thou wast concern'd my virtue was sincere  Whene'er I begg'd for blessings on thy head  Nothing was cold or formal that I said  My warmest vows to heaven were made for thee  And love still mingled with my piety  Oh thou wast all my glory all my pride  Thro' life's uncertain paths my constant guide  Regardless of the world to gain thy praise  Was all that cou'd my just ambition raise  Why has my heart this fond engagement known  Or why has heav'n dissolv'd the tye so soon  Why was the charming youth so form'd to move  Or why was all my soul so turn'd for love  But virtue here a vain defence had made  Where so much worth and eloquence cou'd plead  For he could talk'twas extasy to hear  'Twas joy 'twas harmony to ev'ry ear  Eternal musick dwelt upon his tongue  Sost and transporting as the muses song  List'ning to him my cares were charm'd to rest  And love and silent rapture fill'd my breast  Unheeded the gay moments took their flight  And time was only measur'd by delight  I hear the lov'd the melting accent still  And still the warm the tender transport feel  Again I see the sprightly passions rise  And life and pleasure kindle in his eyes  My fancy paints him now with every grace  But ah the dear resemblance mocks my fond embrace  The flatt'ring vision takes its hasty flight  And scenes of horror swim before my sight  Grief and despair in all their terrors rise  A dying lover pale and gasping lies  Each dismal circumstance appears in view  The fatal object is for ever new  His anguish with the quickest sense I feel  And hear this sad this moving language still  My dearest wife my last my fondest care  Sure heav'n for thee will hear a dying prayer  Be thou the charge of sacred providence  When I am gone be that thy kind defence  Ten thousand smiling blessings crown thy head  When I am cold and number'd with the dead  Think on thy vows be to my mem'ry just  My future fame and honour are thy trust  From all engagements here I now am free  But that which keeps my ling'ring soul with thee  How much I love thy bleeding heart can tell  Which does like mine the pangs of parting feel  But haste to meet me on the happy plains  Where mighty love in endless triumph reigns  He ceas'd then gently yielded up his breath  And fell a blooming sacrifice to death  But oh what words what numbers can express  What thought conceive the height of my distress  Why did they tear me from thy breathless clay  I should have stay'd and wept my life away  Yet gentle shade whether thou now dost rove  Thro' some blest vale or ever verdant grove  One moment listen to my grief and take  The softest vows that ever love can make  For thee all thoughts of pleasure I forego  For thee my tears shall never cease to flow  For thee at once I from the world retire  To feed in silent shades a hopeless fire  My bosom all thy image shall retain  The full impression there shall still remain  As thou hast taught my tender heart to prove  The noblest height and elegance of love  That sacred passion I to thee confine  My spotless faith shall be for ever thine  A Ballad by Mr GAY  I  'TWAS when the seas were roaring  With hollow blasts of wind  A damsel lay deploring  All on a rock reclin'd  Wide o'er the rolling billows  She cast a wistful look  Her head was crown'd with willows  That tremble o'er the brook  II  Twelve months are gone and over  And nine long tedious days  Why didst thou vent'rous lover  Why didst thou trust the seas  Cease cease thou cruel ocean  And let my lover rest  Ah what's thy troubled motion  To that within my breast  III  The merchant robb'd of pleasure  Sees tempests in despair  But what's the loss of treasure  To losing of my dear  Should you some coast be laid on  Where gold and di'monds grow  You'd find a richer maiden  But none that loves you so  IV  How can they say that nature  Has nothing made in vain  Why then beneath the water  Should hideous rocks remain  No eyes the rocks discover  That lurk beneath the deep  To wreck the wand'ring lover  And leave the maid to weep  V  All melancholy lying  Thus wail'd she for her dear  Repay'd each blast with sighing  Each billow with a tear  When o'er the white wave stooping  His floating corpse she spy'd  Then like a lilly drooping  She bow'd her head

Apron Deary  or some wanton tune  Be merry lad and keep thy heart aboon  SANDY  Na na it winna do leave me to mane  This aught days twice o'er tell'd I'll whistle nane  RICHY  Wow man that's unco'sadis that ye'r  Jo  Has ta'en the struntOr has some boglebo  Glowrin frae 'mang auld waws gi'en ye a fleg  Or has some dawted wedder broke his leg  SANDY  Naithing like that sic troubles eith were born  What's boglesweddersor what's  Mausy  's scorn  Our loss is meikle mair and past remeed  Edie  that play'd and sang sae sweet is dead  RICHY  Dead sayst thou oh had up my heart o  Pan  Ye Gods what laids ye lay on feckless Man  Alake therefore I canna wyt y'er wae  I'll bear ye company for year and day  A better lad ne'er lean'd out o'er a kent  Or hound a coly o'er the mossy bent  Blyth at the bought how aft ha we three been  Hartsome on hills and gay upon the green  SANDY  That's true indeed but now thae days are gane  And with him a' that's pleasant on the plain  A summer day I never thought it lang  To hear him make a roundel or a sang  How sweet he sung where vines and myrtles grow  And wimpling waters which in  Latium  flow  Titry  the  Mantuan  herd wha lang sinsyne  Best sung on aeten reed the lover's pine  Had he been to the fore now in our days  Wi  Edie  he had frankly dealt his bays  As lang's the warld shall  Amaryllis  ken  His  Rosamond  shall eccho thro' the glen  While on burn banks the yellow gowan grows  Or wand'ring lambs rin bleeting after ews  His fame shall last Last shall his sang of weirs  While  British  bairns brag of their bauld forbears  We'll mickle miss his blyth and witty jest  At spaining time or at our  Lambmass  feast  O  Richy  but 'tis hard that death ay reaves  Away the best fouck and the ill anes leaves  Hing down ye'r heads ye hills greet out ye'r springs  Upon ye'r edge na mair the shepherd sings  RICHY  Than he had ay a good advice to gi'e  And kend my thoughts amaist as well as me  Had I been thowless vext or oughtlins sow'r  He wad have made me blyth in haff an hour  Had  Rosie  ta'en the dortsor had the tod  Worry'd my lambor were my feet ill shod  Kindly he'd laugh when sae he saw me dwine  And taulk of happiness like a divine  Of ilka thing he had an unco' skill  He kend be moonlight how tydes ebb and fill  He kend what kend he no E'en to a hair  He'd tell o'ernight gin niest day wad be fair  Blind  John  ye mind wha sang in kittle phrase  How the ill sp'rit did the first mischief raise  Mony a time beneath the auld birktree  What's bonny in that sang he loot me see  The Lasses aft flang down their rakes and pales  And held their tongues o strange to hear his tales  SANDY  Sound be his sleep and saft his wak'ning be  He's in a better case than thee or me  He was o'er good for us the Gods hae ta'en  Their ain but backhe was a borrow'dlen  Let us be good gin virtue be our drift  Then may we yet forgether 'boon the lift  But see the sheep are wysing to the cleugh  Thomas  has loos'd his ousen frae the pleugh  Maggy  be this has beuk the supper scones  And nuckle ky stand rowting on the lones  Come  Richy  let us truse and hame o'er bend  And make the best of what we canna mend  FINIS  AN EXPLANATION OF  RICHY  and  SANDY  By Mr BURCHET  RICHY  _WHAT makes thee look so sad dear  Sandie  say  Rouse up dull fellow take thy reed and play  A merry jigg or try some other art  To raise thy spirits and cheer up thy heart  SANDY  No no it will not do leave me to moan  Till twice eight days are past I'll whistle none  RICHY  That's strange indeed has  Jenny  made thee sad  Or tell me hath some horrid spectre lad  Glaring from ruins old in silent night  Surpriz'd and put thee in a panic fright  Or ails that wether ought thy favourite  SANDY  Such troubles might with much more ease be born  What's goblins wethers or what's woman's scorn  Our loss is greater far for  Addy  's dead  Addy  who sang so sweetly on the mead  RICHY  Dead is he say'st thou guard my heart oh  Pan  What burthens Gods ye lay on feeble man  Alack I cannot blame thee for thy grief  Nor hope I more than thou to find relief  A better lad ne'er lean'd on shepherd's crook  Nor after game halloo'd his dog to look  How glad where ews give milk have we three been  Merry on hills and gay upon the green  SANDY  That's true indeed but now alas in vain  We seek for pleasure on the rural plain  I never thought a summer'sday too long  To hear his couplets or his tuneful song  How sweet he sang where vines and myrtles grow  And winding streams which in old  Latium  flows  Titry  the  Mantuan  herd who long ago  Sang best on oaten reed the lover's woe  Did he fam'd bard but live in these our days  He would with  Addy  freely share his bays  As long as shepherd's  Amaryllis  hear  So long his  Rosamond  shall please the ear  While spangled daisie near the riv'let grows  And tender lambs seek after bleating ews  His fame shall last Last shall his song of wars  While  British  youngsters boast of ancestors  Much shall we miss his merry witty jests  At weaningtimes and at our  Lambmass  feasts  Oh  Richy Richy  death hath been unkind  To take the good and leave the ill behind  Bow down your heads ye hills weep dry ye springs  For on your banks no more the shepherd sings  RICHY  Then he had always good advice to give  And could my thoughts like as my self conceive  When I've been drooping vex'd or in the spleen  In one half hour with him I've merry been  Had  Jenny  froward been or  Raynard  bold  Worry'd my lamb or were my shoes grown old  Kindly he'd smile when he observ'd me grieve  And by his talk divine my breast relieve  Addy  did all things to perfection know  Saw by the moon how tides would ebb or flow  He knew what knew he not E'en to a hair  He'd tell o'ernight if next day would be fair  The fam'd blind bard sang in mysterious phrase  How envious Satan did first mischief raise  But oft beneath the wellspread birchentree  The beauties of that song he made me see  The lasses oft' flung down their rakes and pails  And held their tongues oh strange to hear his tales  SANDY  Sound be his sleep and soft his waking be  More happy is he far than thee or me  Too good he was for us the Gods but lent  Him here below when hither he was sent  Let us be good if virtue be our aim  Then we may meet above the skies again  But see how tow'rds the glade the fatlings go  Thomas  hath ta'en the oxen from the plough  Joan  has prepar'd the supper 'gainst we come  And late calf'd cows stand lowing near their home  Then let's have done and to our rest repair  And what we cannot help with patience bear  FINIS  To Mr  Allan Ramsey  on his  Richy  and  Sandy  By Mr BURCHET  WELL fare thee  Allan  who in mother tongue  So sweetly hath of breathless  Addy  sung  His endless fame thy nat'ral genius fir'd  And thou hast written as if he inspir'd  Richy  and  Sandy  who do him survive  Long as thy rural Stanzas last shall live  The grateful swains thou'st made in tuneful verse  Mourn sadly o'er their latelost patron's herse  Nor would the  Mantuan  bard if living blame  Thy pious zeal or think thou'st hurt his fame  Since  Addison  's inimitable lays  Give him an equal title to the bays  When he of armies sang in lofty strains  It seem'd as if he in the hostile plains  Had present been His pen hath to the life  Trac'd ev'ry action in the sanguine strife  In council now sedate the chief appears  Then loudly thunders in  Bavarian  ears  And still pursuing the destructive theme  He pushes them into the rapid stream  Thus beaten out of  Blenheim  's neighb'ring fields  The  Gallic  gen'ral to the victor yields  Who as  Britannia  's  Virgil  hath observ'd  From threaten'd fate all  Europe  then preserv'd  Nor dost thou  Ramsey  sightless  Milton  wrong  By ought contain'd in thy melodious song  For none but  Addy  could his thoughts sublime  So well unriddle or his mystick rhyme  And when he deign'd to let his fancy rove  Where sunburnt shepherds to the nymphs make love  No one e'er told in softer notes the tales  Of rural pleasures in the spangled vales  So much oh  Allan  I thy lines revere  Such veneration to his mem'ry bear  That I no longer could my thanks refrain  For what thou'st sung of the lamented swain
