be exalted and extolled and be very high As many were astonished at thee his visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men so shall he sprinkle many nations the kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they consider Who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed  For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him He is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted But he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all He was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth He was taken from prison and from judgement and who shall declare his generation for he was cut  off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken And he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand He shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors"  These words are extant in a book purporting to contain the predictions of a writer  who lived seven centuries before the Christian aera  That material part of every argument from prophecy namely that the words alledged were actually spoken or written before the fact to which they are applied took place or could by any natural means be foreseen is in the present instance incontestable The record comes out of the custody of adversaries The Jews as an ancient father well observed are our librarians The passage is in their copies as well as in ours With many attempts to explain it away none has ever been made by them to discredit its authenticity  And what adds to the force of the quotation is that it is taken from a writing  declaredly prophetic  a writing professing to describe such future transactions and changes in the world as were connected with the fate and interests of the Jewish nation It is not a passage in an historical or devotional composition which because it  turns out to be applicable to some future events or to some future situation of affairs is presumed to have been oracular The words of Isaiah were delivered by him in a prophetic character with the solemnity belonging to that character and what he so delivered was all along understood by the Jewish reader to refer to something that was to take place after the time of the author The public sentiments of the Jews concerning the design of Isaiah's writings are set forth in the book of Ecclesiasticus "He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at the last and he comforted them that mourned in Sion He shewed what should come to pass for ever and secret things or ever they came" ch xlviii v  It is also an advantage which this prophecy possesses that it is intermixed with no other subject It is entire separate and uninterruptedly directed to one scene of things  The  application  of the prophecy to the evangelic history is plain and appropriate Here is no double sense no figurative language but what is sufficiently intelligible to every reader of every country The obscurities by which I mean the expressions that require a knowledge of local diction and of local allusion are few and not of great importance Nor have I found that varieties of reading or a different construing of the original produce any material alteration in the sense of the prophecy Compare the common translation with that of Bishop Lowth and the difference is not considerable So far as they do differ Bishop Lowth's corrections which are the faithful result of an accurate examination bring the description nearer to the New Testament history than it was before In the fourth verse of the fiftythird chapter what our Bible renders "stricken" he translates "judicially stricken" and in the eighth verse the clause "he was taken from prison and from judgement" the Bishop gives "by an oppressive judgement he was taken off"  The next words to these "who shall declare his generation" are much cleared up in their meaning by the Bishop's version "his manner of life who would declare"  i e  who would stand forth in his defence The former part of the ninth verse "and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death" which inverts the circumstances of Christ's passion the Bishop brings out in an order perfectly agreeable to the event "and his grave was appointed with the wicked but with the rich man was his tomb" The words in the eleventh verse "by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many" are in the Bishop's version "by the  knowledge of him  shall my righteous servant justify many"  It is natural to enquire what turn the Jews themselves give to this prophecy  "Vaticinium hoc Esaiae est carnificina Rabbinorum de quo aliqui Judaei mihi confessi sunt Rabbinos suos ex propheticis scripturis facile se extricare potuisse  modo Esaias tacuisset"  Hulse Theol Jud p quoted by Poole in loc  There is  good proof that the ancient Rabbins explained it of their expected Messiah  Hulse Theol Jud p  but their modern expositors concur I think in representing it as a description of the calamitous state and intended restoration of the Jewish people who are here as they say exhibited under the character of a single person I have not discovered that their exposition rests upon any critical arguments or upon these in any other than a very minute degree The clause in the ninth verse which we render "for the transgression of my people was he stricken" and in the margin "was the stroke upon him" the Jews read "for the transgression of my people was the stroke upon  them"  And what they alledge in support of the alteration amounts only to this that the Hebrew pronoun is capable of a plural as well as of a singular signification that is to say is capable of their construction as well as ours  Bishop Lowth adopts in this place the reading of the seventy which gives smitten  to death  "for the transgression of my people was he smitten to death" The addition of the words "to death" makes an end of the Jewish interpretation of the clause And the authority upon which this reading though not given by the present Hebrew text is adopted Dr Kennicot has set forth by an argument not only so cogent but so clear and popular that I beg leave to transcribe the substance of it into this note "Origen after having quoted at large this prophecy concerning the Messiah tells us that having once made use of this passage in a dispute against some that were accounted wise among the Jews one of them replied that the words did not mean one man but one people the Jews who were smitten of God and dispersed among the Gentiles for their conversion that he then urged many parts of this prophecy to shew the absurdity of this interpretation and that he seemed to press them the hardest by this sentence"for the transgression of my people was he smitten to death" Now as Origen the author of the Hexapla must have understood Hebrew we cannot suppose that he would have urged this last text as so decisive if the Greek version had not agreed here with the Hebrew text nor that these wise Jews would have been at all distressed by this quotation unless the Hebrew text had read agreeably to the words "to death" on which the argument principally depended for by quoting it immediately they would have triumphed over him and reprobated his Greek version This whenever they could do it was their constant practice in their disputes with the Christians Origen himself who laboriously compared the Hebrew text with the Septuagint has recorded the necessity of arguing with the Jews from such passages only as were in the Septuagint agreeable to the Hebrew Wherefore as Origen had carefully compared the Greek version of the Septuagint with the Hebrew text and as he puzzled and confounded the learned Jews by urging upon them the reading "to death" in this place it seems almost impossible not to conclude both from Origen's argument and the silence of his Jewish adversaries that the Hebrew text at that time actually had the word agreeably to the version of the seventy" Lowth's Isaiah p    And this is all the variation contended for the rest of the prophecy they read as we do  The probability therefore of their exposition is a subject of which we are as capable of judging as themselves This judgement is open indeed to the good sense of every attentive reader The application which the Jews contend for appears to me to labour under insuperable difficulties in particular it may be demanded of them to explain in  whose  name or person if the Jewish people be the sufferer does the prophet speak when he says "he hath borne  our  griefs and carried  our  sorrows yet  we  did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for  our  transgressions he was bruised for  our  iniquities the chastisement of  our  peace was upon him and with his stripes  we  are healed" Again the description in the seventh verse "he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth" quadrates with no part of the Jewish history with which we are acquainted The mention of the "grave" and the "tomb" in the ninth verse is not very applicable to the fortunes of a nation and still less so is the conclusion of the prophecy in the twelfth verse which expressly represents the sufferings as  voluntary  and the sufferer as interceding for the offenders "because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors"  There are other prophecies of the Old  Testament interpreted by Christians to relate to the gospel history which are deserving both of great regard and of a very attentive consideration but I content myself with stating the above as well because I think it the clearest and the strongest of all as because most of the rest in order that their value be represented with any tolerable degree of sidelity require a discussion unsuitable to the limits and nature of this work The reader will find them disposed in order and distinctly explained in Bishop Chandler's treatise upon the subject and he will bear in mind what has been often and I think truly urged by the advocates of Christianity that there is no other eminent person to the history of whose life so many circumstances can be made to apply They who object that much has been done by the power of chance the ingenuity of accommodation and the industry of research ought to try whether the same or any thing like it could be done if Mahomet or any other person were proposed as the subject of Jewish prophecy  II A second head of argument from prophecy is founded upon our Lord's predictions concerning the destruction of Jerusalem recorded by three out of the four evangelists  Luke xxi "And as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts he said As for these things which ye behold the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down And they asked him saying Master but when shall these things be and what sign shall there be when these things shall come to pass And he said Take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and the time draweth near Go ye not therefore after them But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is not by and by Then said he unto them Nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and great  earthquakes shall be in divers places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven But before all these they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake And it shall turn to you for a testimony Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist And ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolk and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to death And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake But there shall not an hair of your head perish In your patience possess ye your souls And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh Then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are  in the countries enter thereinto For these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people And they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled"  In terms nearly similar this discourse is related in the twentyfourth chapter of Matthew and the thirteenth of Mark The prospect of the same evils drew from our Saviour upon another occasion the following affecting expressions of concern which are preserved by St Luke xix "And when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying If thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes for  the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation" These passages are direct and explicit predictions References to the same event some plain some parabolical or otherwise figurative are found in divers other discourses of our Lord  Mat xxi xxii Mark xii Luke xiii xx xxi    The general agreement of the description with the event viz with the ruin of the Jewish nation and the capture of Jerusalem under Vespasian thirtysix years after Christ's death is most evident and the accordancy in various articles of detail and circumstance has been shewn by many learned writers It is also an advantage to the enquiry and to the argument built upon it that we have  received a copious account of the transaction from Josephus a Jewish and contemporary historian This part of the case is perfectly free from doubt The only question which in my opinion can be raised upon the subject is whether the prophecy was really delivered  before  the event I shall apply therefore my observations to this point solely  The judgement of antiquity though varying in the precise year of the publication of the three gospels  concurs  in assigning them a date prior to the destruction of Jerusalem  Lardner vol xiii    This judgement is confirmed by a strong probability arising from the course of human life The destruction of Jerusalem took place in the seventieth year after the birth of Christ The three evangelists one of whom was his immediate companion and the other two associated with his companions were it is probable not much  younger than he was They must consequently have been far advanced in life when Jerusalem was taken and no reason has been given why they should defer writing their histories so long    Le Clerc Diss III de Quat Ev num vii p  If the evangelists at the time of writing the gospels had known of the destruction of Jerusalem by which catastrophe the prophecies were plainly fulfilled it is most probable that in recording the predictions they would have dropped some word or other about the completion in like manner as Luke after relating the denunciation of a dearth by Agabus adds "which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar  Acts xi  " whereas the prophecies are given distinctly in one chapter of each of the three first gospels and referred to in several different passages of each and in none of all these places does there appear the smallest intimation that the things spoken of were  come to pass I do admit that it would have been the part of an impostor who wished his readers to believe that his book was written before the event when in truth it was written after it to have suppressed any such intimation carefully But this was not the character of the authors of the gospel Cunning was no quality of theirs Of all writers in the world they thought the least of providing against objections Moreover there is no clause in any one of them that makes a profession of having written prior to the Jewish wars which a fraudulent purpose would have led them to pretend They have done neither one thing nor the other They have neither inserted any words which might signify to the reader that their accounts were written  before  the destruction of Jerusalem which a sophist would have done nor have they dropped a hint of the completion of the prophecies recorded by them which an  undesigning  writer writing  after  the event could hardly on some or other of the many occasions that presented themselves have missed of doing  The admonitions  Luke xxi "When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto"  Mat xiv "When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies then let them which be in Judea slee unto the mountains let him which is on the house top not come down to take any thing out of his house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes"  which Christ is represented to have given to his followers to save themselves by flight are not easily accounted for upon the supposition of the prophecy being fabricated after the event Either the Christians when the siege approached did make their escape from Jerusalem or they did not if they did they must have had the prophecy amongst them if they did not know of any such prediction at the time of the siege if they did not take notice of any such warning it was an improbable fiction in a writer publishing his  work near to that time which upon any even the lowest and most disadvantageous supposition was the case with the gospels now in our hands and addressing his work to Jews and to Jewish converts which Matthew certainly did to state that the followers of Christ had received admonitions of which they made no use when the occasion arrived and of which experience then recent proved that those who were most concerned to know and regard them were ignorant or negligent Even if the prophecies came to the hands of the evangelists through no better vehicle than tradition it must have been by a tradition which subsisted prior to the event And to suppose that without any authority whatever without so much as even any tradition to guide them they had forged these passages is to impute to them a degree of fraud and imposture from every appearance of which their compositions are as far removed as possible  I think that if the prophecies had been  composed after the event there would have been more specification The names or descriptions of the enemy the general the emperor would have been found in them The designation of the time would have been more determinate And I am fortified in this opinion by observing that the counterfeited prophecies of the Sybilline oracles of the twelve patriarchs and I am inclined to believe most others of the kind are mere transcripts of the history moulded into a prophetic form  It is objected that the prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem is mixed or connected with expressions which relate to the final judgement of the world and so connected as to lead an ordinary reader to expect that these two events would not be far distant from each other To which I answer that the objection does not concern our present argument If our Saviour actually foretold the destruction of Jerusalem it is sufficient even although we should allow that the narration of the prophecy  had combined together what had been said by him upon kindred subjects without accurately preserving the order or always noticing the transition of the discourse  CHAP II The morality of the gospel  IN stating the morality of the gospel as an argument of its truth I am willing to admit two points first that the teaching of morality was not the primary design of the mission secondly that morality neither in the gospel nor in any other book can be a subject properly speaking of discovery  If I were to describe in a very few words the scope of Christianity as a  revelation  Great and inestimably beneficial effects may accrue from the mission of Christ and especially from his death which do not belong to Christianity as a  revelation  that is they might have existed and they might have been accomplished though we had never in this life been made acquainted with them These effects may be very extensive They may be interesting even to other orders of intelligent beings  I should say that it was to influence the  conduct of human life by establishing the proof of a future state of reward and punishment"to bring life and immortality to light" The direct object therefore of the design is to supply motives and not rules sanctions and not precepts And these were what mankind stood most in need of The members of civilized society can in all ordinary cases judge tolerably well how they ought to act but without a future state or which is the same thing without credited evidence of that state they want a  motive  to their duty they want at least strength of motive sufficient to bear up against the force of passion and the temptation of present advantage Their rules want authority The most important service that can be rendered to human life and that consequently which one might expect beforehand would be the great end and office of a revelation from God is to convey to the world authorised assurances of the reality of a future existence And although in doing this or by the ministry of the same person by which this is done moral precepts or examples  or illustrations of moral precepts may be occasionally given and be highly valuable yet still they do not form the original purpose of the mission  Secondly morality neither in the gospel nor in any other book can be a subject of discovery properly so called By which proposition I mean that there cannot in morality be any thing similar to what are called discoveries in natural philosophy in the arts of life and in some sciences as the system of the universe the circulation of the blood the polarity of the magnet the laws of gravitation alphabetical writing decimal arithmetic and some other things of the same sort facts or proofs or contrivances before totally unknown and unthought of Whoever therefore expects in reading the New Testament to be struck with discoveries in morals in the manner in which his mind was affected when he first came to the knowledge of the discoveries above mentioned or rather in the manner in which the world was affected by  them when they were first published expects what as I apprehend the nature of the subject renders it impossible that he should meet with And the foundation of my opinion is this that the qualities of actions depend entirely upon their effects which effects must all along have been the subject of human experience  When it is once settled no matter upon what principle that to do good is virtue the rest is calculation But since the calculation cannot be instituted concerning each particular action we establish intermediate rules by which proceeding the business of morality is much facilitated for then it is concerning our rules alone that we need enquire whether in their tendency they be beneficial concerning our actions we have only to ask whether they be agreeable to the rules We refer actions to rules and rules to public happiness Now in the formation of these rules there is no place for discovery properly so called but there is  ample room for the exercise of wisdom judgement and prudence  As I wish to deliver argument rather than panegyric I shall treat of the morality of the gospel in subjection to these observations And after all I think it such a morality as considering from whom it came is most extraordinary and such as without allowing some degree of reality to the character and pretensions of the religion it is difficult to account for or to place the argument a little lower in the scale it is such a morality as completely repels the supposition of its being the tradition of a barbarous age or of a barbarous people of the religion being founded in folly or of its being the production of craft and it repels also in a great degree the supposition of its having been the effusion of an enthusiastic mind  The division under which the subject may be most conveniently treated of is that  of the things taught and the manner of teaching  Under the first head I should willingly if the limits and nature of my work admitted of it transcribe into this chapter the whole of what has been said upon the morality of the gospel by the author of  the internal evidence of Christianity  because it perfectly agrees with my own opinion and because it is impossible to say the same things so well This acute observer of human nature and as I believe sincere convert to Christianity appears to me to have made out satisfactorily the two following positions viz  I That the gospel omits some qualities which have usually engaged the praises and admiration of mankind but which in reality and in their general effects have been prejudicial to human happiness  II That the gospel has brought forwards some virtues which possess the highest intrinsic  value but which have commonly been overlooked and contemned  The first of these propositions he exemplifies in the instances of friendship patriotism active courage in the sense in which these qualities are usually understood and in the conduct which they often produce  The second in the instances of passive courage or endurance of sufferings patience under affronts and injuries humility irresistance placability  The truth is there are two opposite descriptions of character under which mankind may generally be classed The one possesses vigour firmness resolution is daring and active quick in its sensibilities jealous of its fame eager in its attachments inflexible in its purpose violent in its resentments  The other meek yielding complying forgiving not prompt to act but willing to  suffer silent and gentle under rudeness and insult suing for reconciliation where others would demand satisfaction giving way to the pushes of impudence conceding and indulgent to the prejudices the wrongheadedness the intractability of those with whom it has to deal  The former of these characters is and ever hath been the favourite of the world It is the character of great men There is a dignity in it which universally commands respect  The latter is poorspirited tame and abject Yet so it hath happened that with the founder of Christianity this latter is the subject of his commendation his precepts his example and that the former is so in no part of its composition This and nothing else is the character designed in the following remarkable passages "Resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and  take away thy coat let him have thy cloke also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you" This certainly is not commonplace morality It is very original It shews at least and it is for this purpose we produce it that no two things can be more different than the Heroic and the Christian character  Now the author to whom I refer has not only remarked this difference more strongly than any preceding writer but has proved in contradiction to first impressions to popular opinion to the encomiums of orators and poets and even to the suffrages of historians and moralists that the latter character possesses the most of true worth both as being most difficult either to be acquired or sustained and as contributing most to the happiness and tranquillity of social life The state of his argument is as follows  I If this disposition were universal the case is clear the world would be a society of friends Whereas if the other disposition were universal it would produce a scene of universal contention The world could not hold a generation of such men  II If what is the fact the disposition be partial if a few be actuated by it amongst a multitude who are not in whatever degree it does prevail in the same proportion it prevents allays and terminates quarrels the great disturbers of human happiness and the great sources of human misery so far as man's happiness and misery depend upon man Without this disposition enmities must not only be frequent but once begun must be eternal for each retaliation being a fresh injury and consequently requiring a fresh  satisfaction  no period can be assigned to the reciprocation of affronts and to the progress of hatred but that which closes the lives or at least the intercourse of the parties  I would only add to these observations  that although the former of the two characters above described may be occasionally useful although perhaps a great general or a great statesman may be formed by it and these may be instruments of important benefits to mankind yet is this nothing more than what is true of many qualities which are acknowledged to be vicious  Envy  is a quality of this sort I know not a stronger stimulus to exertion Many a scholar many an artist many a soldier has been produced by it Nevertheless since in its general effects it is noxious it is properly condemned certainly is not praised by sober moralists  It was a portion of the same character as that we are defending or rather of his love of the same character which our Saviour displayed in his repeated correction of the ambition of his disciples his frequent admonitions that greatness with them was to consist in humility his censure of that love of distinction and greediness of superiority which the chief persons amongst his countrymen  were wont on all occasions great and little to betray "They the scribes and pharisees love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets and to be called of men Rabbi Rabbi But be not ye called Rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are brethren and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven neither be ye called masters for one is your master even Christ but he that is greatest among  you  shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted  Mat xxili See also Mark xii Luke xx xiv  " I make no farther remark upon these passages because they are in truth only a repetition of the doctrine different expressions of the principle which we have already stated except that some of the passages especially our Lord's advice to the guests at an entertainment Luke xiv seem to extend the rule to what we call  manners  which was both regular in point of consistency and not so much beneath the dignity of our Lord's mission as may at first fight be supposed for bad manners are bad morals  It is sufficiently apparent that the precepts we have recited or rather the disposition which these precepts inculcate relate to personal conduct from personal motives to cases in which men act from impulse for themselves and from themselves When it comes to be considered what is necessary to be done for the sake of the public and out of a regard to the general welfare which consideration for the most part ought exclusively to govern the duties of men in public stations it comes to a case to which the rules do not belong This distinction is plain and if it were less so the consequence would not be much felt for it is very seldom that in the intercourse of private life men act with public views The personal motives from which they do act the rule regulates  The preference of the patient to the heroic character which we have here noticed and which the reader will find explained at large in the work to which we have referred him is a peculiarity in the Christian institution which I propose as an argument of wisdom very much beyond the situation and natural character of the person who delivered it  II A  second  argument drawn from the morality of the New Testament is the stress which is laid by our Saviour upon the regulation of the thoughts And I place this consideration next to the other because they are connected The other related to the malicious passions this to the voluptuous Together they comprehend the whole character  "Out of the  heart  proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications cThese are the things which defile a man" Mat xv  "Wo unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but  within  they are full of extortion and excessYe are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but  within  ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity" Mat xxiii  And more particularly that strong expression Mat v "Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart"  There can be no doubt with any reflecting mind but that the propensities of our nature must be subjected to regulation but the question is  where  the check ought to be placed upon the thought or only upon action In this question our Saviour in the texts here quoted has pronounced a decisive judgment He makes the control  of thought essential Internal purity with him is every thing Now I contend that this is the only discipline which can succeed in other words that a moral system which prohibits actions but leaves the thoughts at liberty will be ineffectual and is therefore unwise I know not how to go about the proof of a point which depends upon experience and upon a knowledge of the human constitution better than by citing the judgement of persons who appear to have given great attention to the subject and to be well qualified to form a true opinion about it Boerhaave speaking of this very declaration of our Saviour "Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath already committed adultery with her in his heart" and understanding it as we do to contain an injunction to lay the check upon the thoughts was wont to say that "our Saviour knew mankind better than Socrates" Haller who has recorded this saying of Boerhaave's adds to it the following remarks of his own  Letters to his Daughter  "It did not escape the observation  of our Saviour that the rejection of any evil thoughts was the best defence against vice for when a debauched person sills his imagination with impure pictures the licentious ideas which he recalls fail not to stimulate his desires with a degree of violence which he cannot resist This will be followed by gratification unless some external obstacle should prevent him from the commission of a sin which he had internally resolved on" "Every moment of time says our author that is spent in meditations upon sin increases the power of the dangerous object which has possessed our imagination" I suppose these reflections will be generally assented to  III Thirdly had a teacher of morality been asked concerning a general principle of conduct and for a short rule of life and had he instructed the person who consulted him "constantly to refer his actions to what he believed to be the will of his Creator and constantly to have in view not his own interest and gratisication alone but  the happiness and comfort of those about him" he would have been thought I doubt not in any age of the world and in any even the most improved state of morals to have delivered a judicious answer because by the first direction he suggested the only motive which acts steadily and uniformly in sight and out of sight in familiar occurrences and under pressing temptations and in the second he corrected what of all tendencies in the human character stands most in need of correction  selfishness  or a contempt of other men's conveniency and satisfaction In estimating the value of a moral rule we are to have regard not only to the particular duty but the general spirit not only to what it directs us to do but to the character which a compliance with its direction is likely to form in us So in the present instance the rule here recited will never fail to make him who obeys it  considerate  not only of the rights but of the feelings of other men bodily and mental in great matters and in small of the ease the accommodation the selfcomplacency  of all with whom he has any concern especially of all who are in his power or dependent upon his will  Now what in the most applauded philosopher of the most enlightened age of the world would have been deemed worthy of his wisdom and of his character to say our Saviour hath said and upon just such an occasion as that which we have feigned  "Then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying Master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets" Mat xxii  The second precept occurs in St Matthew on another occasion similar to this  xix and both of them upon a third similar occasion in Luke x In these two latter instances the question proposed was "What shall I do to inherit eternal life"  Upon all these occasions I consider the words of our Saviour as expressing precisely the same thing as what I have put into the mouth of the moral philosopher Nor do I think that it detracts much from the merit of the answer that these precepts are extant in the Mosaic code for his laying his finger if I may so say upon these precepts his drawing them out from the rest of that voluminous institution his stating of them not simply amongst the number but as the greatest and the sum of all the others in a word his proposing of them to his hearers for their rule and principle was our Saviour's own  And what our Saviour had said upon the subject appears to me to have  fixed  the sentiment amongst his followers  St Paul has it expressly "If there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  Rom xiii  " and again "For all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  Gal v  "  St John in like manner "This commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also  John iv  "  St Peter not very differently "Seeing that ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently  Pet i  "  And it is so well known as to require no citations to verify it that this love or charity or in other words regard to the welfare of others runs in various forms through all the preceptive parts of the apostolic  writings It is the theme of all their exhortations that with which their morality begins and ends from which all their details and enumerations set out and into which they return  And that this temper for some time at least descended in its purity to succeeding Christians is attested by one of the earliest and best of the remaining writings of the apostolical fathers the epistle of the Roman Clement The meekness of the Christian character reigns throughout the whole of that excellent piece The occasion called for it It was to compose the dissensions of the church of Corinth And the venerable hearer of the apostles does not fall short in the display of this principle of the finest passages of their writings He calls to the remembrance of the Corinthian church its former character in which "ye were all of you he tells them humble minded not boasting of any thing desiring rather to be subject than to govern to give than to receive being content with the portion God  had dispensed to you and hearkening diligently to his word ye were enlarged in your bowels having his sufferings always before your eyes Ye contended day and night for the whole brotherhood that with compassion and a good conscience the number of his elect might be saved Ye were sincere and without offence towards each other Ye bewailed every one his neighbour's sins esteeming their defects your own  Ep Clem Rom c Abp Wake's Translation  " His prayer for them was for the "return of peace long suffering and patience  Ib c  " And his advice to those who might have been the occasion of difference in the society is conceived in the true spirit and with a perfect knowledge of the Christian character "Who is there among you that is generous Who that is compassionate Who that has any charity Let him say if this sedition this contention and these schisms be upon my account I am ready to depart to go away whithersoever ye please and do whatsoever ye shall command  me only let the flock of Christ be in peace with the elders who are set over it He that shall do this shall get to himself a very great honour in the Lord and there is no place but what willbe ready to receive him for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof These things they who have their conversation towards God not to be repented of both have done and will always be ready to do  Ep Clem Rom c  "  This sacred principle this earnest recommendation of forbearance lenity and forgiveness mixes with all the writings of that age There are more quotations in the apostolical fathers of texts which relate to these points than of any other Christ's sayings had struck them "Not rendering faith Polycarp the disciple of John evil for evil or railing for railing or striking for striking or cursing for cursing  Pol Ep ad Phil c  " Again speaking of some whose behaviour had given great offence "Be ye moderate says he upon this occasion and look not upon such  as enemies but call them back as suffering and erring members that ye save your whole body  Pol Ep ad Phil c  "  "Be ye mild at their anger saith Ignatius the companion of Polycarp humble at their boastings to their blasphemies return your prayers to their error your firmness in the faith when they are cruel be ye gentle not endeavouring to imitate their ways let us be their brethren in all kindness and moderation but let us be followers of the Lord for who was ever more unjustly used more destitute more despised"  IV A fourth quality by which the morality of the gospel is distinguished is the exclusion of regard to fame and reputation  "Take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven  Mat vi  "  "When thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly  Mat vi  "  And the rule by parity of reason is extended to all other virtues  I do not think that either in these or in any other passage of the New Testament the pursuit of fame is stated as a vice it is only said that an action to be virtuous must be independent of it I would also observe that it is not publicity but ostentation which is prohibited not the mode but the motive of the action which is regulated A good man will prefer that mode as well as those objects of his beneficence by which he can produce the greatest effect and the view of this purpose may dictate sometimes publication and sometimes concealment Either the one or the other may be the  mode  of  the action according as the end to be promoted by it appears to require But from the  motive  the reputation of the deed and the fruits and advantage of that reputation to ourselves must be shut out or in whatever proportion they are not so the action in that proportion fails of being virtuous  This exclusion of regard to human opinion is a difference not so much in the duties to which the teachers of virtue would persuade mankind as in the manner and topics of persuasion And in this view the difference is great When  we  set about to give advice our lectures are full of the advantages of character of the regard that is due to appearances and to opinion of what the world especially of what the good or great will think and say of the value of public esteem and of the qualities by which men acquire it Widely different from this was our Saviour's instruction and the difference was founded upon the best reasons For however the care of reputation the authority of public opinion or even of the  opinion of good men the satisfaction of being well received and well thought of the benefit of being known and distinguished are topics to which we are fain to have recourse in our exhortations the true virtue is that which discards these considerations absolutely and which retires from them all to the single internal purpose of pleasing God This at least was the virtue which our Saviour taught And in teaching of this he not only confined the views of his followers to the proper measure and principle of human duty but acted in consistency with his office as a monitor from heaven  Next to what our Saviour taught may be considered the manner of his teaching which was extremely peculiar yet I think precisely adapted to the peculiarity of his character and situation His lessons did not consist of disquisitions of any thing like moral essays or like sermons or like set treatises upon the several points which he mentioned When he delivered a precept  it was seldom that he added any proof or argument still seldomer that he accompanied it with what all precepts require limitations and distinctions His instructions were conceived in short emphatic sententious rules in occasional reflections or in round maxims I do not think that this was a natural or would have been a proper method for a philosopher or a moralist or that it is a method which can be successfully imitated by us But I contend that it was suitable to the character which Christ assumed and to the situation in which as a teacher he was placed He produced himself as a messenger from God He put the truth of what he taught upon authority  I  say unto you Swear not at all  I  say unto you Resist not evil  I  say unto you Love your enemies  Mat v    In the choice therefore of his mode of teaching the purpose by him to be consulted was  impression  because conviction which forms the principal end of our discourses was to arise in the minds of his followers  from a different source from their respect to his person and authority Now for the purpose of impression singly and exclusively I repeat again that we are not here to consider the convincing of the understanding I know nothing which would have so great force as strong ponderous maxims frequently urged and frequently brought back to the thoughts of the hearers I know nothing that could in this view be said better than "Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you the first and great commandment is Thou shalt love the Lord thy God and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" It must also be remembered that our Lord's ministry upon the supposition either of one year or of three compared with his work was of short duration that within this time he had many places to visit various audiences to address that his person was generally besieged by crowds of followers that he was sometimes driven away from the place where he was teaching by persecution and at other times thought  fit to withdraw himself from the commotions of the populace Under these circumstances nothing appears to have been so practicable or likely to be so efficacious as leaving wherever he came concise lessons of duty These circumstances at least shew the necessity he was under of comprising what he delivered within a small compass In particular his sermon upon the mount ought always to be considered with a view to these observations The question is not whether a fuller a more accurate a more systematic or a more argumentative discourse upon morals might not have been pronounced but whether more could have been said in the same room better adapted to the exigencies of the hearers or better calculated for the purpose of impression Seen in this light it hath always appeared to me to be admirable Dr Lardner thought that this discourse was made up of what Christ had said at different times and upon different occasions several of which occasions are noticed in St Luke's narrative I can perceive no reason for this opinion I  believe that our Lord delivered this discourse at one time and place in the manner related by St Matthew and that he repeated the same rules and maxims at different times as opportunity or occasion suggested that they were often in his mouth were repeated to different audiences and in various conversations  It is incidental to this mode of moral instruction which proceeds not by proof but upon authority not by disquisition but by precept that the rules will be conceived in absolute terms leaving the application and the distinctions that attend it to the reason of the hearer It is likewise to be expected that they will be delivered in terms by so much the more forcible and energetic as they have to encounter natural or general propensities It is further also to be remarked that many of those strong instances which appear in our Lord's sermon such as "If any man will smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also If any man will sue thee at the law and take away  thy coat let him have thy cloke also Whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain" though they appear in the form of specific precepts are intended as descriptive of disposition and character A specific compliance with the precepts would be of little value but the disposition which they inculcate is of the highest He who should content himself with waiting for the occasion and with literally observing the rule when the occasion offered would do nothing or worse than nothing but he who considers the character and disposition which is hereby inculcated and places that disposition before him as the model to which he should bring his own takes perhaps the best possible method of improving the benevolence and of calming and rectifying the vices of his temper  If it be said that this disposition is unattainable I answer so is all perfection ought therefore a moralist to recommend imperfections One excellency however of our Saviour's rules is that they are  either never mistaken or never so mistaken as to do harm I could feign a hundred cases in which the literal application of the rule "of doing to others as we would that others should do unto us" might mislead us but I never yet met with the man who was actually misled by it Notwithstanding that our Lord bid his followers "not to resist evil" and "to forgive the enemy who should trespass against them not till seven times but till seventy times seven" the Christian world has hitherto suffered little by too much placability or forbearance I would repeat once more what has already been twice remarked that these rules were designed to regulate personal conduct from personal motives and for this purpose alone  I think that these observations will assist us greatly in placing our Saviour's conduct as a moral teacher in a proper point of view especially when it is considered that to deliver moral disquisitions was no part of his design to teach morality at all was only  a subordinate part of it his great business being to supply what was much more wanting than lessons of morality stronger moral sanctions and clearer assurances of a future judgement  Some appear to require in a religious system or in the books which profess to deliver that system minute directions for every case and occurrence that may arise This say they is necessary to render a revelation perfect especially one which has for its object the regulation of human conduct Now how prolix and yet how incomplete and unavailing such an attempt must have been is proved by one notable example "The Indoo and Mussulman religion are institutes of civil law regulating the minutest questions both of property and of all questions which come under the cognizance of the magistrate And to what length details of this kind are necessarily carried when once begun may be understood from an anecdote of the Mussulman code which we have received from the most respectable authority that not less than  seventyfive thousand  traditional precepts have been promulgated" Hamilton's translation of the Hedaya or Guide    The  parables  of the New Testament are many of them such as would have done honour to any book in the world I do not  mean in style and diction but in the choice of the subjects in the structure of the narratives in the aptness propriety and force of the circumstances woven into them and in some as that of the good Samaritan the prodigal son the pharisee and the publican in an union of pathos and simplicity which in the best productions of human genius is the fruit only of a much exercised and wellcultivated judgement  The Lord's prayer  for a succession of solemn thoughts for fixing the attention upon a few great points for suitableness to every condition for sufficiency for conciseness without obscurity for the weight and real importance of its petitions is without an equal or a rival  From whence did these come Whence had this man this wisdom Was our Saviour in fact a wellinstructed philosopher whilst he is represented to us as an illiterate peasant Or shall we say that some early Christians of taste and education composed  these pieces and ascribed them to Christ Beside all other incredibilities in this account I answer with Dr Jortin that they  could not  do it No specimens of composition which the Christians of the first century have left us authorize us to believe that they were equal to the task And how little qualified the Jews the countrymen and companions of Christ were to assist him in the undertaking may be judged of from the traditions and writings of theirs which were the nearest to that age The whole collection of the Talmud is one continued proof into what follies they fell whenever they left their Bible and how little capable they were of furnishing out such lessons as Christ delivered  But there is still another view in which our Lord's discourses deserve to be considered and that is in their  negative  character not in what they did but in what they did not contain Under this head the following reflections appear to me to possess some weight  I They exhibit no particular description of the invisible world The future happiness of the good and the misery of the bad which is all we want to be assured of is directly and positively affirmed and is represented by metaphors and comparisons which were plainly intended as metaphors and comparisons and as nothing more As to the rest a solemn reserve is maintained The question concerning the woman who had been married to seven brothers "Whose shall she be on the resurrection" was of a nature calculated to have drawn from Christ a more circumstantial account of the state of the human species in their future existence He cut short however the enquiry by an answer which at once rebuked intruding curiosity and was agreeable to the best apprehensions we are able to form upon the subject viz "That they who are accounted worthy of that resurrection shall be as the angels of God in heaven" I lay a stress upon this reserve because it repels the suspicion of enthusiasm for enthusiasm is wont to expatiate upon the condition of  the departed above all other subjects and with a wild particularity It is moreover a topic which is always listened to with greediness The teacher therefore whose principal purpose is to draw upon himself attention is sure to be full of it The Koran of Mahomet is half made up of it  II Our Lord enjoined no austerities He not only enjoined none as absolute duties but he recommended none as carrying men to a higher degree of divine favour Place Christianity in this respect by the side of all institutions which have been founded in the fanaticism either of their author or of his first followers or rather compare in this respect Christianity as it came from Christ with the same religion after it fell into other hands with the extravagant merit very soon ascribed to celibacy solitude voluntary poverty with the rigours of an ascetic and the vows of a monastic life the hair shirt the watchings the midnight prayers the obmutescence the gloom and  mortification of religious orders and of those who aspired to religious perfection  III Our Saviour uttered no impassioned devotion There was no heat in his piety or in the language in which he expressed it no vehement or rapturous ejaculations no violent urgency in his prayers The Lord's prayer is a model of calm devotion His words in the garden are unaffected expressions of a deep indeed but sober piety He never appears to have been worked up into any thing like that elation or that emotion of spirits which is occasionally observed in most of those to whom the name of enthusiast can in any degree be applied I feel a respect for methodists because I believe that there is to be found amongst them much sincere piety and availing though not always wellinformed Christianity yet I never attended a meeting of theirs but I came away with the reflection how different what I heard was from what I read I do not mean in doctrine with  which at present I have no concern but in manner how different from the calmness the sobriety the good sense and I may add the strength and authority of our Lord's discourses  IV It is very usual with the human mind to substitute forwardness and fervency in a particular cause for the merit of general and regular morality and it is natural and politic also in the leader of a sect or party to encourage such a disposition in his followers Christ did not overlook this turn of thought yet though avowedly placing himself at the head of a new institution he notices it only to condemn it "Not every one that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven many will say unto me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess  unto you I never knew you depart from me  ye that work iniquity  Mat vii  " So far was the author of Christianity from courting the attachment of his followers by any sacrifice of principle or by a condescension to the errors which even zeal in his service might have inspired This was a proof both of sincerity and judgement  V Nor fifthly did he fall in with any of the depraved fashions of his country or with the natural biass of his own education Bred up a Jew under a religion extremely technical in an age and amongst a people more tenacious of the ceremonies than of any other part of that religion he delivered an institution containing less of ritual and that more simple than is to be found in any religion which ever prevailed amongst mankind We have known I do allow examples of an enthusiasm which has swept away all external ordinances before it But this spirit certainly did not dictate our Saviour's conduct either in his treatment of  the religion of his country or in the formation of his own institution In both he displayed the soundness and moderation of his judgement He censured an overstrained scrupulousness or perhaps an affectation of scrupulousness about the sabbath but how did he censure it not by contemning or decrying the institution itself but by declaring that "the sabbath was made for man not man for the sabbath" that is to say that the sabbath was to be subordinate to its purpose and that that purpose was the real good of those who were the subjects of the law The same concerning the nicety of some of the pharisees in paying tithes of the most trifling articles accompanied with a neglect of justice fidelity and mercy He finds fault with them for misplacing their anxiety He does not speak disrespectfully of the law of tithes or of their observance of it but he assigns to each class of duties its proper station in the scale of moral importance All this might be expected perhaps from a wellinstructed cool and judicious philosopher but was  not to be looked for from an illiterate Jew certainly not from an impetuous enthusiast  VI Nothing could be more quibbling than were the comments and expositions of the Jewish doctors at that time nothing so puerile as their distinctions Their evasion of the fifth commandment their exposition of the law of oaths are specimens of the bad taste in morals which then prevailed Whereas in a numerous collection of our Saviour's apothegms many of them referring to sundry precepts of the Jewish law there is not to be found one example of sophistry or of false subtlety or of any thing approaching thereunto  VII The national temper of the Jews was intolerant narrowminded and excluding In Jesus on the contrary whether we regard his lessons or his example we see not only benevolence but benevolence the most enlarged and comprehensive In the parable of the good Samaritan the very point of the story is that the person relieved  by him was the national and religious enemy of his benefactor Our Lord declared the equity of the divine administration when he told the Jews what probably they were surprised to hear "That many should come from the east and west and should sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven but that the children of the kingdom shoud be cast into outer darkness  Mat viii  " His reproof of the hasty zeal of his disciples who would needs call down fire from heaven to revenge an affront put upon their Master shews the lenity of his character and of his religion and his opinion of the manner in which the most unreasonable opponents ought to be treated or at least of the manner in which they ought not to be treated The terms in which his rebuke was conveyed deserve to be noticed"Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of  Luke ix  "  VIII Lastly amongst the negative qualities  of our religion as it came out of the hands of its founder and his apostles we may reckon its complete abstraction from all views either of ecclesiastical or civil policy or to meet a language much in fashion with some men from the politics either of priests or statesmen Christ's declaration that "his kingdom was not of this world" recorded by John his evasion of the question whether it was lawful or not to give tribute unto Cesar mentioned by the three other evangelists his reply to an application that was made to him to interpose his authority in a question of property "Man who made me a ruler or a judge over you" ascribed to him by St Luke his declining to exercise the office of a criminal judge in the case of the woman taken in adultery as related by John are all intelligible significations of our Saviour's sentiments upon this head And with respect to  politics  in the usual sense of that word or discussions concerning different forms of government Christianity declines every question upon the subject Whilst politicians are disputing  about monarchies aristocracies and republics the gospel is alike applicable useful and friendly to them all inasmuch as st it tends to make men virtuous and as it is easier to govern good men than bad men under any constitution as dly it states obedience to government in ordinary cases to be not merely a submission to force but a duty of conscience as dly it induces dispositions favourable to public tranquillity a Christian's chief care being to pass quietly through this world to a better as thly it prays for communities and for the governors of communities of whatever description or denomination they be with a solicitude and fervency proportioned to the influence which they possess upon human happiness All which in my opinion is just as it should be Had there been more to be found in scripture of a political nature or convertible to political purposes the worst use would have been made of it on whichever side it seemed to lie  When therefore we consider Christ as a  moral teacher remembring that this was only a secondary part of his office and that morality by the nature of the subject does not admit of discovery properly so called when we consider either what he taught or what he did not teach either the substance or the manner of his instruction his preference of solid to popular virtues of a character which is commonly despised to a character which is universally extolled his placing in our licentious vices the check in the right place viz upon the thoughts his collecting of human duty into two well devised rules his repetition of these rules the stress he laid upon them especially in comparison with positive duties and his fixing thereby the sentiments of his followers his exclusion of all regard to reputation in our devotion and alms and by parity of reason in our other virtues when we consider that his instructions were delivered in a form calculated for impression the precise purpose in his situation to be consulted and that they were illustrated by parables the choice and structure of which  would have been admired in any composition whatever when we observe him free from the usual symptoms of enthusiasm heat and vehemence in devotion austerity in institutions and a wild particularity in the descriptions of a future state free also from the depravities of his age and country without superstition amongst the most superstitious of men yet not decrying positive distinctions or external observances but soberly recalling them to the principle of their establishment and to their place in the scale of human duties without sophistry or trifling amidst teachers remarkable for nothing so much as frivolous subtleties and quibbling expositions candid and liberal in his judgement of the rest of mankind although belonging to a people who affected a separate claim to divine favour and in consequence of that opinion prone to uncharitableness partiality and restriction when we find in his religion no scheme of building up a hierarchy or of ministring to the views of human governments in a word when we compare Christianity  as it came from its author either with other religions or with itself in other hands the most reluctant understanding will be induced to acknowledge the probity I think also the good sense of those to whom it owes its origin and that some regard is due to the testimony of such men when they declare their knowledge that the religion proceeded from God and when they appeal for the truth of their assertion to miracles which they wrought or which they saw  Perhaps the qualities which we observe in the religion may be thought to prove something more They would have been extraordinary had the religion come from any person from the person from whom it did come they are exceedingly so What was Jesus in external appearance a Jewish peasant the son of a carpenter living with his father and mother in a remote province of Palestine until the time that he produced himself in his public character He had no master to instruct or prompt him  He had read no books but the works of Moses and the prophets He had visited no polished cities He had received no lessons from Socrates or Plato nothing to form in him a taste or judgement different from that of the rest of his countrymen and of persons of the same rank of life with himself Supposing it to be true which it is not that all his points of morality might be picked out of Greek and Roman writings they were writings which  he  had never seen Supposing them to be no more than what some or other had taught in various times and places he could not collect them together  Who were his coadjutors in the undertaking the persons into whose hands the religion came after his death a few fishermen upon the lake of Tiberias persons just as uneducated and for the purpose of framing rules of morality as unpromising as himself Suppose the mission to be real all this is accounted for the unsuitableness of the authors to the production of the characters  to the undertaking no longer surprises us but without  reality  it is very difficult to explain how such a system should proceed from such persons Christ was not like any other carpenter the apostles were not like any other fishermen  But the subject is not exhausted by these observations That portion of it which is most reducible to points of argument has been stated and I trust truly There are however some topics of a more diffuse nature which yet deserve to be proposed to the reader's attention  The  character of Christ  is a part of the morality of the gospel one strong observation upon which is that neither as represented by his followers nor as attacked by his enemies is he charged with any personal vice This remark is as old as Origen"Though innumerable lies and calumnies had been forged against the venerable Jesus none had dared to charge him with an intemperance  Or Ep Cels l num ed Bened  "  Not a reflection upon his moral character not an imputation or suspicion of any offence against purity and chastity appears for five hundred years after his birth This faultlessness is more peculiar than we are apt to imagine Some stain pollutes the morals or the morality of almost every other teacher and of every other lawgiver  See many instances collected by Grotiusde Ver in the notes to his second book p Pocock's edition  Zeno the stoic and Diogenes the cynic fell into the foulest impurities of which also Socrates himself was more than suspected Solon forbad unnatural crimes to slaves Lycurgus tolerated theft as a part of education Plato recommended a community of women Aristotle maintained the general right of making war upon Barbarians The elder Cato was remarkable for the ill usage of his slaves The younger gave up the person of his wife One loose principle is found in almost all the Pagan moralists is distinctly however perceived in the writings of Plato Xenophon Cicero  Seneca Epictetus and that is the allowing and even the recommending to their disciples a compliance with the religion and with the religious rites of every country into which they came In speaking of the founders of new institutions we cannot forget Mahomet His licentious transgressions of his own licentious rules his abuse of the character which he assumed and of the power which he had acquired for the purposes of personal and privileged indulgence his avowed claim of a special permission from heaven of unlimited sensuality is known to every reader as it is confessed by every writer of the Moslem story  Secondly in the histories which are left us of Jesus Christ although very short and although dealing in narrative and not in observation or panegyric we perceive beside the absence of every appearance of vice traces of devotion humility benignity mildness patience prudence I speak of  traces  of these qualities because the qualities themselves are to be collected from incidents  inasmuch as the terms are never used of Christ in the gospels nor is any formal character of him drawn in any part of the New Testament  Thus we see the  devoutness  of his mind in his frequent retirement to solitary prayer  Mat xiv ix xxvi  in his habitual giving of thanks  Mat xi Mark viii John vi Luke xxii  in his reference of the beauties and operations of nature to the bounty of providence  Mat vi  in his earnest addresses to his Father more particularly that short but solemn one before the raising of Lazarus from the dead  John xi  and in the deep piety of his behaviour in the garden on the last evening of his life  Mat xxvi  his  humility  in his constant reproof of contentions for superiority  Mark ix  the  benignity  and affectionateness of his temper in his kindness to children  Mark x  in the tears which he shed  over his falling country  Luke xix  and upon the death of his friend  John xi  in his noticing of the widow's mite  Mark xii  in his parables of the good Samaritan of the ungrateful servant and of the pharisee and publican of which parables no one but a man of humanity could have been the author the  mildness  and lenity of his character is discovered in his rebuke of the forward zeal of his disciples at the Samaritan village  Luke ix  in his expostulation with Pilate  John xix  in his prayer for his enemies at the moment of his suffering  Luke xxiii  which though it has been since very properly and frequently imitated was then I apprehend new His  prudence  is discerned where prudence is most wanted in his conduct upon trying occasions and in answers to artful questions Of these the following are examplesHis withdrawing in various instances from the first symptoms of tumult  Mat xiv Luke v John v vi  and with the express care as appears from  St Matthew  Mat xii  of carrying on his ministry in quietness his declining of every species of interference with the civil affairs of the country which disposition is manifested by his behaviour in the case of the woman caught in adultery  John viii  and in his repulse of the application which was made to him to interpose his decision about a disputed inheritance  Luke xii  his judicious yet as it should seem unprepared answers will be confessed in the case of the Roman tribute  Mat xxii  in the difficulty concerning the interfering relations of a future state as proposed to him in the instance of a woman who had married seven brethren  Ib  and more especially in his reply to those who demanded from him an explanation of the authority by which he acted which reply consisted in propounding a question to them situated between the very difficulties into which they were insidiously endeavouring to draw  him  xxi et seq    Our Saviour's lessons beside what has already  been remarked in them touch and that oftentimes by very affecting representations upon some of the most interesting topics of human duty and of human meditation upon the principles by which the decisions of the last day will be regulated  Mat xxv et seq  upon the superior or rather the supreme importance of religion  Mark viii Mat vi Luke xii  upon penitence by the most pressing calls and the most encouraging invitations  Luke xv  upon selfdenial  Mat v  watchfulness  Mark xiii Mat xxiv xxv  placability  Luke xvii Mat xviii  confidence in God  Mat v  the value of spiritual that is of mental worship  John iv  the necessity of moral obedience and the directing of that obedience to the spirit and principle of the law instead of seeking for evasions in a technical construction of its terms  Mat v    If we extend our argument to other parts of the New Testament we may offer as amongst the best and shortest rules of life or which is the same thing descriptions of virtue that have ever been delivered the following passages  "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world  James i  "  "Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned  Tim i  "  "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world  Tit ii  "  Enumerations of virtues and vices and  those sufficiently accurate and unquestionably just are given by St Paul to his converts in three several epistles  Gal v Col iii Cor xiii    The relative duties of husbands and wives of parents and children of masters and servants of Christian teachers and their flocks of governors and their subjects are set forth by the same writer  Eph v vi vi Cor vi Rom xiii  not indeed with the copiousness the detail or the distinctness of a moralist who should in these days sit down to write chapters upon the subject but with the leading rules and principles in each and above all with truth and with authority  Lastly the whole volume of the New Testament is replete with  piety  with what were almost unknown to heathen moralists  devotional virtues  the most profound veneration of the Deity an habitual sense of his bounty and protection a firm confidence in  the final result of his councils and dispensations a disposition to resort upon all occasions to his mercy for the supply of human wants for assistance in danger for relief from pain for the pardon of sin  CHAP III The candour of the writers of the New Testament  I MAKE this candour to consist in their putting down many passages and noticing many circumstances which no writer whatever was likely to have forged and which no writer would have chosen to appear in his book who had been careful to present the story in the most unexceptionable form or who had thought himself at liberty to carve and mould the particulars of that story according to his choice or according to his judgement of the effect  A strong and wellknown example of the fairness of the evangelists offers itself in their account of Christ's resurrection namely in their unanimously stating that after he was risen he appeared to his disciples alone I do not mean that they have used  the exclusive word  alone  but that all the instances which they have recorded of his appearance are instances of appearance to his disciples that their reasonings upon it and allusions to it are consined to this supposition and that by one of them Peter is made to say "Him God raised up the third day and shewed him openly not to all the people but to witnesses chosen before of God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead  Acts x  " The commonest understanding must have perceived that the history of the resurrection would have come with more advantage if they had related that Jesus appeared after he was risen to his soes as well as his friends to the scribes and pharisees the Jewish council and the Roman governor or even if they had asserted the public appearance of Christ in general unqualified terms without noticing as they have done the presence of his disciples upon each occasion and noticing it in such a manner as to lead their  readers to suppose that none but disciples were present They  could  have represented it one way as well as the other And if their point had been to have the religion believed whether true or false if they had fabricated the story ab initio or if they had been disposed either to have delivered their testimony as witnesses or to have worked up their materials and information as historians in such a manner as to render their narrative as specious and unobjectionable as they could in a word if they had thought of any thing but of the truth of the case as they understood and believed it they would in their account of Christ's several appearances after his resurrection at least have omitted this restriction At this distance of time the account as we have it is perhaps more credible than it would have been the other way because this manifestation of the historian's candour is of more advantage to their testimony than the difference in the circumstances of the account would have been to the nature of the evidence But this is an effect which the evangelists would not foresee  and I think that it was by no means the case at the time when the books were composed  Mr Gibbon has argued for the genuineness of the Koran from the confessions which it contains to the apparent disadvantage of the Mahometan cause  Vol ix c note  The same defence vindicates the genuineness of our gospels and without prejudice to the cause at all  There are some other instances in which the evangelists honestly relate what they must have perceived would make against them  Of this kind is John the Baptist's message preserved by St Matthew and St Luke xi vii "Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him Art thou he that should come or look we  for another To confess still more to state that John the Baptist had his doubts concerning the character of Jesus could not but afford a handle to cavil and objection But truth like honesty neglects appearances The same observation perhaps holds concerning the apostacy of Judas  I had once placed amongst these examples of fair concession the remarkable words of St Matthew in his account of Christ's appearance upon the Galilean mountain "and when they saw him they worshipped him  but some doubted  xxviii  " I have since however been convinced by what is observed concerning this passage  Page  in Dr Townsend's discourse upon the resurrection that the transaction as related by St Matthew was really this "Christ appeared first  at a distance  the greater part of the company the moment they saw him worshipped but some as yet  i e  upon this first distant view of his person doubted whereupon Christ  came up  St Matthew's words are  This intimates that when he first appeared it was at a distance at least from many of the spectators Ib p  to them and spake to them" c that the doubt therefore was a doubt only at first for a moment and upon his being seen at a distance and was afterwards dispelled by his nearer approach and by his entering into conversation with them    John vi "From that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him" Was it the part of a writer who dealt in suppression and disguise to put down  this  anecdote  Or this which Matthew has preserved xiii "He did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief"  Again in the same evangelist v "Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfil for verily I say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled" At the time the gospels were written the apparent tendency of Christ's mission was to diminish the authority of the Mosaic code and it was so considered by the Jews themselves It is very improbable therefore that without the constraint of truth Matthew should have ascribed a saying to Christ which  primo intuitu  militated with the judgement  of the age in which his gospel was written Marcion thought this text so objectionable that he altered the words so as to invert the sense  Lard vol xv p    Once more Acts xxv "They brought none accusation against him of such things as I supposed but had certain questions against him of their own superstition and of one Jesus which was dead whom Paul affirmed to be alive" Nothing could be more in the character of a Roman governor than these words But that is not precisely the point I am concerned with A mere panegyrist or a dishonest narrator would not have represented his cause or have made a great magistrate represent it in this manner  i e  in terms not a little disparaging and bespeaking on his part much unconcern and indifference about the matter The same observation may be repeated of the speech which is ascribed to Gallio Acts viii "If it be a question  of words and names and of your law look ye to it for I will be no judge of such matters"  Lastly where do we discern a stronger mark of candour or less disposition to extol and magnify than in the conclusion of the same history in which the evangelist after relating that Paul upon his first arrival at Rome preached to the Jews from morning until evening adds "And some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not"  The following I think are passages which were very unlikely to have presented themselves to the mind of a forger or a fabulist  Matt xxi "Jesus answered and said unto them Verily I say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done unto the figtree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the  sea it shall be done all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing it shall be done  See also xvii Luke xvii  " It appears to me very improbable that these words should have been put into Christ's mouth if he had not actually spoken them The term "faith" as here used is perhaps rightly interpreted of considence in that internal notice by which the apostles were admonished of their power to perform any particular miracle And this exposition renders the sense of the text more easy But the words undoubtedly in their obvious construction carry with them a difficulty which no writer would have brought upon himself officiously  Luke ix "And he said unto another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father Jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of God  See also Mat viii  " This answer though very expressive  of the transcendent importance of religious concerns was apparently harsh and repulsive and such as would not have been made for Christ if he had not really used it At least some other instance would have been chosen  The following passage I for the same reason think impossible to have been the production of artifice or of a cold forgery"But I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement and whosoever shall say to his brother Raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hellsire Gehennae" Mat v It is emphatic cogent and well calculated for the purpose of impression but is inconsistent with the supposition of art or wariness on the part of the relator  The short reply of our Lord to Mary Magdalen after his resurrection John xx "Touch me not for I am not  yet ascended unto my Father" in my opinion must have been founded in a reference or allusion to some prior conversation for the want of knowing which his meaning is hidden from us This very obscurity however is a proof of genuineness No one would have forged such an answer  John vi The whole of the conversation recorded in this chapter is in the highest degree unlikely to be fabricated especially the part of our Saviour's reply between the fiftieth and the fiftyeighth verse I need only put down the first sentence "I am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that I will give him is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world" Without calling in question the expositions that have been given of this passage we may be permitted to say that it labours under an obscurity in which it is impossible to believe that any one who made speeches for the persons of his narrative would have voluntarily involved  them That this discourse was obscure even at the time is confessed by the writer who has preserved it when he tells us at the conclusion that many of our Lord's disciples when they had heard this said "This is a hard saying who can bear it"  Christ's taking of a young child and placing it in the midst of his contentious disciples Mat xviii though as decisive a proof as any could be of the benignity of his temper and very expressive of the character of the religion which he wished to inculcate was not by any means an obvious thought Nor am I acquainted with any thing in any ancient writing which resembles it  The account of the institution of the Eucharist bears strong internal marks of genuineness If it had been feigned it would have been more full It would have come nearer to the actual mode of celebrating the rite as that mode obtained very  early in Christian churches and it would have been more formal than it is In the forged piece called the apostolic constitutions the apostles are made to enjoin many parts of the ritual which was in use in the second and third centuries with as much particularity as a modern rubric could have done Whereas in the history of the Lord's supper as we read it in St Matthew's gospel there is not so much as the command to repeat it This surely looks like undesignedness I think also that the difficulty arising from the conciseness of Christ's expression "This is my body" would have been avoided in a madeup story I allow that the explication of these words given by Protestants is satisfactory but it is deduced from a diligent comparison of the words in question with forms of expression used in scripture and especially by Christ upon other occasions No writer would arbitrarily and unnecessarily have thus cast in his reader's way a difficulty which to say the least it required research and erudition to clear up  Now it ought to be observed that the argument which is built upon these examples extends both to the authenticity of the books and to the truth of the narrative for it is improbable that the forger of a history in the name of another should have inserted such passages into it and it is improbable also that the persons whose names the books bear should have fabricated such passages or even have allowed them a place in their work if they had not believed them to express the truth  The following observation therefore of Dr Lardner the most candid of all advocates and the most cautious of all enquirers seems to be well founded"Christians are induced to believe the writers of the gospel by observing the evidences of piety and probity that appear in their writings in which there is no deceit or artifice or cunning or design" "No remarks" as Dr Beattie hath properly said "are thrown in to anticipate objections nothing of that caution which never fails to distinguish the  testimony of those who are conscious of imposture no endeavour to reconcile the reader's mind to what may be extraordinary in the narrative"  I beg leave to cite also another author  Duchal p  who has well expressed the reflection which the examples now brought forward were intended to suggest "It doth not appear that ever it came into the mind of these writers to consider how this or the other action would appear to mankind or what objections might be raised upon them But without at all attending to this they lay the facts before you at no pains to think whether they would appear credible or not If the reader will not believe their testimony there is no help for it they tell the truth and attend to nothing else Surely this looks like sincerity and that they published nothing to the world but what they believed themselves"  As no improper supplement to this chapter I crave a place here for observing the extreme  naturalness  of some of the things related in the New Testament  Mark ix Jesus said unto him "If thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth And straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou mine unbelief" The struggle in the father's heart between solicitude for the preservation of his child and a kind of involuntary distrust of Christ's power to heal him is here expressed with an air of reality which could hardly be counterseited  Again Mat xxi the eagerness of the people to introduce Christ into Jerusalem and their demand a short time afterwards of his crucifixion when he did not turn out what they expected him to be so far from affording matter of objection represents popular favour in exact agreement  with nature and with experience as the flux and reflux of a wave  The rulers and Pharisees rejecting Christ whilst many of the common people received him was the effect which in the then state of Jewish prejudices I should have expected And the reason with which they who rejected Christ's mission kept themselves in countenance and with which also they answered the arguments of those who favoured it is precisely the reason which such men usually give"Have any of the Scribes or Pharisees believed on him" John vii  In our Lord's conversation at the well John iv Christ had surprised the Samaritan woman with an allusion to a single particular in her domestic situation "Thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband" The woman soon after this ran back to the city and called out to her neighbours "Come see a man which told me  all things  that ever  I did" This exaggeration appears to me very natural especially in the hurried state of spirits into which the woman may be supposed to have been thrown  The lawyer's subtlsty in running a distinction upon the word neighbour in the precept "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyseis" was no less natural than our Saviour's answer was decisive and satisfactory Luke x The lawyer of the New Testament it must be observed was a Jewish divine  The behaviour of Gallio Acts xviii and of Festus xxv have been observed upon already  The consistency of St Paul's character throughout the whole of his history viz the warmth and activity of his zeal first against and then for Christianity carries with it very much of the appearance of truth  There are also some  proprieties  as they may be called observable in the gospels that is circumstances separately suiting with the situation character and intention of their respective authors  St Matthew who was an inhabitant of Galilee and did not join Christ's society until some time after Christ had come into Galilee to preach has given us very little of his history prior to that period St John who had been converted before and who wrote to supply omissions in the other gospels relates some remarkable particulars which had taken place before Christ left Judea to go into Galilee  Hartley's Obs vol ii p    St Matthew xv has recorded the cavil of the Pharisees against the disciples of Jesus for eating "with unclean hands" St Mark has also vii recorded the same transaction taken probably from St Matthew but with this addition "For the  Pharisees and all the Jews except they wash their hands often eat not holding the tradition of the elders and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they have received to hold as the washing of cups and pots brazen vessels and of tables" Now St Matthew was not only a Jew himself but it is evident from the whole structure of his gospel especially from his numerous references to the Old Testament that he wrote for Jewish readers The above explanation therefore in him would have been unnatural as not being wanted by the readers whom he addressed But in Mark who whatever use he might make of Matthew's gospel intended his own narrative for a general circulation and who himself travelled to distant countries in the service of the religion it was properly added  CHAP IV Identity of Christ's character  THE argument expressed by this title I apply principally to the comparison of the three first gospels with that of St John It is known to every reader of scripture that the passages of Christ's history preserved by St John are except his passion and resurrection for the most part different from those which are delivered by the other evangelists And I think the ancient account of this difference to be the true one viz that St John wrote  after  the rest and to supply what he thought omissions in their narratives of which the principal were our Saviour's conferences with the Jews of Jerusalem and his discourses to his apostles at his last supper But what I observe in the comparison of these several accounts is that although actions and discourses are ascribed to Christ by  St John in general different from what are given to him by the other evangelists yet under this diversity there is a similitude of  manner  which indicates that the actions and discourses proceeded from the same person I should have laid little stress upon a repetition of actions substantially alike or of discourses containing many of the same expressions because that is a species of resemblance which would either belong to a true history or might easily be imitated in a false one Nor do I deny that a dramatic writer is able to sustain propriety and distinction of character through a great variety of separate incidents and situations But the evangelists were not dramatic writers nor possessed the talents of dramatic writers nor will it I believe be suspected that they  studied  uniformity of character or ever thought of any such thing in the person who was the subject of their histories Such uniformity if it exist is on their part casual and if there be as I contend there is a perceptible resemblance of  manner  in passages and between discourses which are in themselves  extremely distinct and are delivered by historians writing without any imitation of or reference to one another it affords a just presumption that these are what they profess to be the actions and the discourses of the same real person that the evangelists wrote from fact and not from imagination  The article in which I find this agreement most strong is in our Saviour's mode of teaching and in that particular property of it which consists in his drawing of his doctrine from the occasion or which is nearly the same thing raising reflections from the objects and incidents before him or turning a particular discourse then passing into an opportunity of general instruction  It will be my business to point out this  manner  in the three first evangelists and then to enquire whether it do not appear also in several examples of Christ's discourses preserved by St John  The reader will observe in the following  quotation that the italic letter contains the reflection the common letter the incident or occasion from which it springs  Mat xii "Then they said unto him Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to speak with thee But he answered and said unto him that told him Who is my mother and who are my brethren And he stretched forth his hands towards his disciples and said Behold my mother and my brethren  for whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother  Mat xvi "And when his disciples were come to the other side they had forgotten to take bread then Jesus said unto them  Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees  And they reasoned among themselves saying It is because we have taken no breadHow is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of  the Sadducees Then understood they  how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the  DOCTRINE  of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees"  Mat xv "Then came to Jesus Scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying Why do thy disciples transgress the traditions of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat breadAnd he called the multitude and said unto them Hear and understand  not that which goeth into the mouth desileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this desileth a man  Then answered Peter and said unto him Declare unto us this parable And Jesus said Are ye also yet without understanding Do ye not yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the draught but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man  for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness  blasphemies these are the things which desile a man  BUT TO EAT WITH UNWASHEN HANDS DEFILETH NOT A MAN" Our Saviour upon this occasion expatiates rather more at large than usual and his discourse also is more divided but the concluding sentence brings back the whole train of thought to the incident in the sirst verse viz the objurgatory question of the Pharisees and renders it evident that the whole sprung from that circumstance  Mark x "And they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them Suffer the little chiidren to come unto me and forbid them not  for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein"  Mark i "Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and  Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers and Jesus said unto them  Come ye after me and I will make you fishers of men"  Luke xi "And it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lift up her voice and said unto him Blessed is the womb that bare thee and the paps which thou hast sucked but he said  Yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it"  Luke xiii "There were present at that season some that told him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrisices and Jesus answering said unto them  Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans because they suffered such things I tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish"  Luke xiv "And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him Blessed is he that shall eat  bread in the kingdom of God Then said he unto him  A certain man made a great supper and bade many"  c The parable is rather too long for insertion but affords a striking instance of Christ's  manner  of raising a discourse from the occasion Observe also in the same chapter two other examples of advice drawn from the circumstances of the entertainment and the behaviour of the guests  We will now see how this  manner  discovers itself in  St John's  history of Christ  John vi "And when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi when camest thou hither Jesus answered them and said Verily I say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled  Labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the Son of man shall give unto you"  John iv "Art thou greater than our father Abraham who gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her the woman of Samaria Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but  whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life"  John iv "In the mean while his disciples prayed him saying Master eat but he said unto them I have meat to eat that ye know not of Therefore said the disciples one to another Hath any man brought him aught to eat Jesus faith unto them  My meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work"  John ix "And as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying Who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind Jesus answered Neither  hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him  I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work As long as I am in the world I am the light of the world"  John ix "Jesus heard that they had cast him the blind man above mentioned out and when he had found him he said unto him Dost thou believe on the Son of God And he answered and said Who is he Lord that I might believe on him And Jesus said unto him Thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee And he said Lord I believe and he worshipped him And Jesus said  For judgement I am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind"  All that the reader has now to do is to compare the series of examples taken from St John with the series of examples taken from the other evangelists and to judge  whether there be not a visible agreement of  manner  between them In the above quoted passages the occasion is stated as well as the reflection They seem therefore the most proper for the purpose of our argument A large however and curious collection has been made by different writers  Newton on Daniel p note  a  Jortin Dis p Bishop Law's Life of Christ  of instances in which it is extremely probable that Christ spoke in allusion to some object or some occasion then before him though the mention of the occasion or of the object be omitted in the history I only observe that these instances are common to St John's gospel with the other three  I conclude this article by remarking that nothing of this  manner  is perceptible in the speeches recorded in the Acts or in any other but those which are attributed to Christ and that in truth it was a very unlikely manner for a forger or fabulist to attempt and a manner very difficult for any  writer to execute if he had to supply all the materials both the incidents and the observations upon them out of his own head A forger or a fabulist would have made for Christ discourses exhorting to virtue and dissuading from vice in general terms It would never have entered into the thoughts of either to have crowded together such a number of allusions to time place and other little circumstances as occur for instance in the sermon on the mount and which nothing but the actual presence of the objects could have suggested  See Bishop Law's Life of Christ    II There appears to me to exist an affinity between the history of Christ's placing a little child in the midst of his disciples as related by the three first evangelists  Mat xviii Mark ix Luke ix  and the history of Christ's washing his disciples' feet as given by St John  xiii  In the stories  themselves there is no resemblance But the affinity which I would point out consists in these two articles first that both stories denote the emulation which prevailed amongst Christ's disciples and his own care and desire to correct it The moral of both is the same Secondly that both stories are specimens of the same manner of teaching viz by action a mode of emblematic instruction extremely peculiar and in these passages ascribed we see to our Saviour by the three first evangelists and by St John in instances totally unlike and without the smallest suspicion of their borrowing from each other  III A singularity in Christ's language which runs through all the evangelists and which is found in those discourses of St John that have nothing similar to them in the other gospels is the appellation of "the son of man" and it is in all the evangelists found under the peculiar circumstance of being applied by Christ to himself but  of never being used of him or towards him by any other person It occurs seventeen times in Matthew's gospel twelve times in Mark's twentyone times in Luke's and eleven times in John's and always with this restriction  IV A point of agreement in the conduct of Christ as represented by his different historians is that of his withdrawing himself out of the way whenever the behaviour of the multitude indicated a disposition to tumult  Mat xiv "And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitude away And when he had sent the multitude away he went up into a mountain apart to pray"  Luke v "But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and great multitudes came together to hear and  to be healed by him of their infirmities and he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed"  With these quotations compare the following from St John  Chap v "And he that was healed wist not who it was for Jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place"  Chap vi "When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain by himself alone"  In this last instance St John gives the motive of Christ's conduct which is left ununexplained by the other evangelists who have related the conduct itself  V Another and a more singular circumstance in Christ's ministry was the reserve  which for some time and upon some occasions at least he used in declaring his own character and his leaving it to be collected from his works rather than his professions Just reasons for this reserve have been assigned  See Locke's Reasonableness of Christianity  But it is not what one would have expected We meet with it in Matthew's gospel xvi "Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ" Again and upon a different occasion in Mark's iii "And unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried saying Thou art the Son of God and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known" Another instance similar to this last is recorded by St Luke iv What we thus find in the three evangelists appears also in a passage of St John x "Then came the Jews round about him and said unto him How long dost thou make us to doubt If thou be the Christ tell us plainly" The occasion here was different  from any of the rest and it was indirect We only discover Christ's conduct through the upbraidings of his adversaries But all this strengthens the argument I had rather at any time surprise a coincidence in some oblique allusion than read it in broad assertions  VI In our Lord's commerce with his disciples one very observable particular is the difficulty which they found in understanding him when he spoke to them of the future part of his history especially of what related to his passion or resurrection This difficulty produced as was natural a wish in them to ask for further explanation from which however they appear to have been sometimes kept back by the fear of giving offence All these circumstances are distinctly noticed by Mark and Luke upon the occasion of his informing them probably for the first time that the son of man should be delivered into the hands of men "They understood not" the evangelists tell us "this saying and it was hid from them  that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying" Luke ix Mark ix In St John's gospel we have upon a different occasion and in a different instance the same difficulty of apprehension the same curiosity and the same restraint"A little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because I go to the Father Then said some of his disciples among themselves What is this that he saith unto us A little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me and because I go to the Father They said therefore What is this that he saith a little while We cannot tell what he saith Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them" c John xvi et seq  VII The meekness of Christ during his last sufferings which is conspicuous in the narratives of the three first evangelists is preserved in that of St John under separate examples The answer given by him in  St John  xviii  when the high priest asked him of his disciples and his doctrine "I spake openly to the world I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the Jews always resort and in secret have I said nothing why askest thou me Ask them which heard me what I have said unto them" is very much of a piece with his reply to the armed party which seized him as we read it in St Mark's gospel and in St Luke's  Mark xiv Luke xxii  "Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and with staves to take me I was daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not" In both answers we discern the same tranquillity the same reference to his public teaching His mild expostulation with Pilate upon two several occasions as related by St John  xviii ix  is delivered with the same unruffled temper as that which conducted him through the last scene of his life as described by his other evangelists His answer  in St John's gospel to the officer who struck him with the palm of his hand "If I have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me  xxviii  " was such an answer as might have been looked for from the person who as he proceeded to the place of execution bid his companions as we are told by St Luke  xxiii  weep not for him but for themselves their posterity and their country and who whilst he was suspended upon the cross prayed for his murderers "for they know not said he what they do" The urgency also of his judges and his prosecutors to extort from him a defence to the accusation and his unwillingness to make any which was a peculiar circumstance appears in St John's account as well as in that of the other evangelists  See John xix Mat xxvii Luke xxiii    There are moreover two other correspondencies between St John's history of the  transaction and theirs of a kind somewhat different from those which we have been now mentioning  The three first evangelists record what is called our Saviour's agony  i e  his devotion in the garden immediately before he was apprehended in which narrative they all make him pray "that the cup might pass from him" This is the particular metaphor which they all ascribe to him St Matthew adds "O my Father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done  xxvi  " Now St John does not give the scene in the garden but when Jesus was seized and some resistance was attempted to be made by Peter Jesus according to his account checked the attempt with this reply "Put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my Father hath given me shall I not drink it  xviii  " This is something more than consistency it is coincidence because it is extremely  natural that Jesus who before he was apprehended had been praying his Father that "that cup might pass from him" yet with such a pious retractation of his request as to have added "If this cup may not pass from me thy will be done" it was natural I say for the same person when he actually was apprehended to express the resignation to which he had already made up his thoughts and to express it in the form of speech which he had before used "The cup which my Father hath given me shall I not drink it" This is a coincidence between writers in whose narratives there is no imitation but great diversity  A second similar correspondency is the following Matthew and Mark make the charge upon which our Lord was condemned to be a threat of destroying the temple "We heard him say I will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days I will build another made without hands  Mark xiv  " but they neither of them inform  us upon what circumstance this calumny was founded St John in the early part of his history  ii  supplies us with this information for he relates that upon our Lord's first journey to Jerusalem when the Jews asked him "What sign shewest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things He answered Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up" This agreement could hardly arise from any thing but the truth of the case From any care or design in St John to make his narrative tally with the narratives of the other evangelists it certainly did not arise for no such design appears but the absence of it  A strong and more general instance of agreement is the following The three first evangelists have related the appointment of the twelve apostles  Mat x Mark iii Luke vi  and have given a catalogue of their names in form John without ever mentioning the appointment or giving the catalogue supposes throughout  his whole narrative Christ to be accompanied by a select party of disciples the number of these to be twelve  vi  and whenever he happens to notice any one as of that number  xx vi  it is one included in the catalogue of the other evangelists and the names principally occurring in the course of  his  history of Christ are the names extant in their list This last agreement which is of considerable moment runs through every gospel and through every chapter of each  All this bespeaks reality  CHAP V Originality of our Saviour's character  THE Jews whether right or wrong had understood their prophecies to foretell the advent of a person who by some supernatural assistance should advance their nation to independence and to a supreme degree of splendour and prosperity This was the reigning opinion and expectation of the times  Now had Jesus been an enthusiast it is probable that his enthusiasm would have fallen in with the popular delusion and that whilst he gave himself out to be the person intended by these predictions he would have assumed the character to which they were universally supposed to relate  Had he been an impostor it was his business to have flattered the prevailing hopes because these hopes were to be the instruments of his attraction and success  But what is better than conjectures is the fact that all the pretended Messiahs actually did so We learn from Josephus that there were many of these Some of them it is probable might be impostors who thought that an advantage was to be taken of the state of public opinion Others perhaps were enthusiasts whose imagination had been drawn to this particular object by the language and sentiments which prevailed around them But whether impostors or enthusiasts they concurred in producing themselves in the character which their countrymen looked for that is to say as the restorers and deliverers of the nation in that sense in which restoration and deliverance were expected by the Jews  Why therefore Jesus if he was like them either an enthusiast or impostor did not pursue the same conduct as they did in framing his character and pretensions it will be found difficult to explain A mission the operation and benefit of which was to take place in another life was a thing unthought of as the subject of these prophecies That Jesus coming to them as their Messiah should come under a character totally different from that in which they expected him should deviate from the general persuasion and deviate into pretensions absolutely singular and original appears to be inconsistent with the imputation of enthusiasm or imposture both which by their nature I should expect would and both which throughout the experience which this very subject furnishes in fact  have  followed the opinions that obtained at the time  If it be said that Jesus having tried the other plan turned at length to this I answer  that the thing is said without evidence against evidence that it was competent to the rest to have done the same yet that nothing of this sort was thought of by any  CHAP VI  ONE argument which has been much relied upon but not more than its just weight deserves is the conformity of the facts occasionally mentioned or referred to in scripture with the state of things in those times as represented by foreign and independent accounts Which conformity proves that the writers of the New Testament possessed a species of local knowledge which could only belong to an inhabitant of that country and to one living in that age This argument if well made out by examples is very little short of proving the absolute genuineness of the writings It carries them up to the age of the reputed authors to an age in which it must have been difficult to impose upon the Christian public forgeries in the names of those authors and in which there is no evidence that any forgeries were attempted It proves at least that the books  whoever were the authors of them were composed by persons living in the time and country in which these things were transacted and consequently capable by their situation of being well informed of the facts which they relate And the argument is stronger when applied to the New Testament than it is in the case of almost any other writings by reason of the mixed nature of the allusions which this book contains The scene of action is not confined to a single country but displayed in the greatest cities of the Roman empire Allusions are made to the manners and principles of the Greeks the Romans and the Jews This variety renders a forgery proportionably more difficult especially to writers of a posterior age A Greek or Roman Christian who lived in the second or third century would have been wanting in Jewish literature a Jewish convert in those ages would have been equally deficient in the knowledge of Greece and Rome  Michaelis's Introduction to the New Testament Marsh's translation c ii sec xi    This however is an argument which depends entirely upon an induction of particulars and as consequently it carries with it little force without a view of the instances upon which it is built I have to request the reader's attention to a detail of examples distinctly and articulately proposed In collecting these examples I have done no more than epitomize the first volume of the first part of Dr Lardner's credibility of the gospel history And I have brought the argument within its present compass first by passing over some of his sections in which the accordancy appeared to me less certain or upon subjects not sufficiently appropriate or circumstantial secondly by contracting every section into the fewest words possible contenting myself for the most part with a mere  apposition  of passages and thirdly by omitting many disquisitions which though learned and accurate are not absolutely necessary to the understanding or verification of the argument  The writer principally made use of in  the enquiry is Josephus Josephus was born at Jerusalem four years after Christ's ascension He wrote his history of the Jewish war some time after the destruction of Jerusalem which happened in the year of our Lord seventy that is thirtyseven years after the ascension and his history of the Jews he finished in the year ninetythree that is sixty years after the ascension  At the head of each article I have referred by figures included in brackets to the page of Dr Lardner's volume where the section from which the abridgement is made begins The edition used is that of  I p Mat xi "When he Joseph heard that Archelaus did reign in Judea in the room of his father Herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstanding being warned of God in a dream he turned aside into the parts of Galilee"  In this passage it is asserted that Archelaus  succeeded Herod in Judea and it is implied that his power did  not  extend to Galilee Now we learn from Josephus that Herod the Great whose dominion included all the land of Israel appointed Archelaus his successor in  Judea  and assigned the  rest  of his dominions to other sons and that this disposition was ratified as to the main parts of it by the Roman emperor  Ant lib c sec    St Matthew says that Archelaus  reigned  was  king  in Judea Agreeably to this we are informed by Josephus not only that Herod appointed Archelaus his successor in Judea but that he also appointed him with the title of king and the Greek verb  which the evangelist uses to denote the government and rank of Archelaus is used likewise by Josephus  De Bell lib c sec    The cruelty of Archelaus's character which is not obscurely intimated by the  evangelist agrees with divers particulars in his history preserved by Josephus "In the tenth year of his government the chief of the Jews and Samaritans not being able to endure his cruelty and tyranny presented complaints against him to Cesar  Ant lib c sec  "  II p Luke iii "In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius CesarHerod being tetrarch of Galilee and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitisthe word of God came unto John"  By the will of Herod the Great and the decree of Augustus thereupon his two sons were appointed one Herod Antipas tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea and the other Philip tetrarch of Trachonitis and the neighbouring countries  Ant lib c sec  We have therefore these two persons in the situations in which St Luke places them and also that they were in these situations in the  fifteenth  year of Tiberius in other words that they continued in possession of their territories and titles until that time and afterwards appears from a passage of Josephus which relates of Herod "that he was  removed  by Caligula the successor of Tiberius  Ant lib c sec  and of Philip that he died in the  twentieth  year of Tiberius when he had governed Trachonitis and Batanea and Gaulanitis thirtyseven years  Ant lib c sec    III p Mark v  See also Mat xiv Luke iii  "Herod had sent forth and laid hold upon John and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake his brother Philip's wife for he had married her"  With this compare Jos Ant l c sec "He Herod the tetrarch made a visit to Herod his brotherHere falling in love with Herodias the wife of the said  Herod he ventured to make her proposals of marriage  The affinity of the two accounts is unquestionable but there is a difference in the name of Herodias's first husband which in the evangelist is Philip in Josephus Herod The difficulty however will not appear considerable when we recollect how common it was in those times for the same person to bear two names "Simon which is called Peter Lebbeus whose sirname is Thaddeus Thomas which is called Didymus Simeon who was called Niger Saul who was also called Paul" The solution is rendered likewise easier in the present case by the consideration that Herod the Great had children by seven or eight wives that Josephus mentions three of his sons under the name of Herod that it is nevertheless highly probable that the brothers bore some additional name by which they were distinguished from one another Lard Vol II p  "  Again Mark vi "And when the  daughter of the said Herodias  came in and danced"  With this also compare Jos Ant l c sec "Herodias was married to Herod son of Herod the Great  They had a daughter  whose name was Salome after  whose birth Herodias in utter violation of the laws of her country left her husband then living and married Herod the tetrarch of Galilee her husband's brother by the father's side"  IV p Acts xii "Now about that time  Herod the king  stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church" In the conclusion of the same chapter Herod's  death  is represented to have taken place soon after this persecution The accuracy of our historian or rather the unmeditated coincidence which truth of it's own accord produces is in this instance remarkable There was no portion of time for thirty years before nor  ever  afterwards in which there was a  king  at Jerusalem a person exercising that authority in Judea or to whom that title could be applied except the three last years of this Herod's life within which period the transaction recorded in the Acts is stated to have taken place This prince was the grandson of Herod the Great In the Acts he appears under his family name  of Herod by Josephus he is called Agrippa For proof that he was a  king  properly so called we have the testimony of Josephus in full and direct terms"Sending for him to his palace Caligula put a crown upon his head and appointed him king of the tetrarchie of Philip intending also to give him the tetrarchie of Lysanias  Ant xviii c vii sec  " And that Judea was at last but not until the last included in his dominions appears by a subsequent passage of the same Josephus wherein he tells us that Claudius by a decree confirmed to Agrippa the dominion which Caligula had given him  adding also Judea and Samaria in the utmost extent as possessed by his grandfather Herod  Ib xix c v sec    V P Acts xii "And he Herod went down from Judea to Cesarea and there abodeAnd upon a set day Herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them and the people gave a shout saying It is the voice of a god and not of a man and immediately  the angel of the Lord smote him because he gave not God the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost"  Jos Ant lib xix c sec "He went to the city Cesarea Here he celebrated showes in honour of Cesar On the second day of the showes early in the morning he came into the theatre dressed in a robe of silver of most curious workmanship The rays of the rising sun reflected from so splendid garb gave him a majestic and awful appearance They called him a god and intreated him to be propitious to them saying Hitherto we have respected you as a man but now we acknowledge you to be more than mortal The king neither reproved these persons nor rejected the impious flatteryImmediately after this he was seized with pains in his bowels extremely violent at the very firstHe was carried therefore with all haste to his palace These pains continually tormenting him he expired in five days time"  The reader will perceive the accordancy of these accounts in various particulars The place Cesarea the set day the gorgeous dress the acclamations of the assembly the peculiar turn of the flattery the reception of it the sudden and critical incursion of the disease are circumstances noticed in both narratives The worms mentioned by St Luke are not remarked by Josephus but the appearance of these is a symptom not unusually I believe attending the disease which Josephus describes viz violent affections of the bowels  VI p Acts xxiv "And after certain days when Felix came with his wife Drusilla which was a Jewess he sent for Paul"  Jos Ant lib xx c sec "Agrippa gave his sister Drusilla in marriage to Azizus king of the Emesenes when he had consented to be circumcisedBut this marriage of Drusilla with Azizus was dissolved in a short time after in this mannerWhen  Felix was procurator of Judea  having had a sight  of her he was mightily taken with herShe was induced to transgress the laws of her country and marry Felix"  Here the public station of Felix the name of his wife and the singular circumstance of her religion all appear in perfect conformity with the evangelist  VII p "And after certain days King Agrippa and Bernice came to Cesarea to salute Festus" By this passage we are in effect told that Agrippa was a king but not of Judea for he came to salute Festus who at this time administered the government of that country at Cesarea  Now how does the history of the age correspond with this account The Agrippa here spoken of was the son of Herod Agrippa mentioned in the last article but that he did not succeed to his father's kingdom nor ever recovered Judea which had been a part of it we learn by the information of Josephus who relates of him that when  his father was dead Claudius intended at first to have put him immediately in possession of his father's dominions but that Agrippa being then but seventeen years of age the emperor was persuaded to alter his mind and appointed Cuspius Fadus prefect of Judea and the whole kingdom  Ant xix c ad sin  which Fadus was succeeded by Tiberius Alexander Cumanus Felix Festus  Ib xx De Bell lib ii  But that though disappointed of his father's kingdom in which was included Judea he was nevertheless rightly styled  King  Agrippa and that he was in possession of considerable territories bordering upon Judea we gather from the same authority for after several successive donations of country "Claudius at the same time that he sent Felix to be procurator of Judea promoted Agrippa from Chalcis to a greater  kingdom  giving to him the tetrarchie which had been Philip's and he added moreover the  kingdom  of Lysanias and the province that had belonged to Varus  De Bell lib ii c ad sin  "  St Paul addresses this person as a Jew "King Agrippa believest thou the prophets I know that thou believest" As the son of Herod Agrippa who is described by Josephus to have been a zealous Jew it is reasonable to suppose that he maintained the same profession But what is more material to remark because it is more close and circumstantial is that St Luke speaking of the father xii calls him Herod the king and gives an example of the exercise of his authority at Jerusalem speaking of the son xxv he calls him king but not of Judea which distinction agrees correctly with the history  VIII p Acts xiii "And when they had gone through the isle Cyprus to Paphos they found a certain sorcerer a false prophet a Jew whose name was Barjesus which was with the deputy of the country Sergius Paulus a prudent man"  The word which is here translated deputy signifies  Proconsul  and upon this word  our observation is founded The provinces of the Roman empire were of two kinds those belonging to the emperor in which the governor was called Propretor and those belonging to the senate in which the governor was called Proconsul And this was a regular distinction Now it appears from Dio Cassius  Lib liv ad A U  that the province of Cyprus which in the original distribution was assigned to the emperor had been transferred to the senate in exchange for some others and that after this exchange the appropriate title of the Roman governor was Proconsul  Ib xviii p "And when Gallio was deputy  Proconsul  of Achaia"  The propriety of the title "Proconsul" is in this passage still more critical For the province of Achaia after passing from the senate to the emperor had been restored again by the emperor Claudius to the senate and consequently its government had become  proconsular  only six or seven years before the time in which this transaction is laid to have taken place  Suet in Claud c xxv Dio lib lxi  And what confines with strictness the appellation to the time is that Achaia under the following reign ceased to be a Roman province at all  IX p It appears as well from the general constitution of a Roman province as from what Josephus delivers concerning the state of Judea in particular  Ant lib xx c sec c i sec  that the power of life and death resided exclusively in the Roman governor but that the Jews nevertheless had magistrates and a council invested with a subordinate and municipal authority This oeconomy is discerned in every part of the gospel narrative of our Saviour's crucifixion  X p Acts ix "Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria"  This  rest  synchronises with the attempt of Caligula to place his statue in the Temple of Jerusalem the threat of which outrage produced amongst the Jews a consternation that for a season diverted their attention from every other object  Jos de Bell lib xi c sec    XI p Acts xxi "And they took Paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shut And as they went about to kill him tidings came to the chief captain of the  band  that all Jerusalem was in an uprore Then the chief captain came near and took him and commanded him to be bound with two chains and demanded who he was and what he had done and some cried one thing and some another among the multitude and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded him to be carried into the  castle  And when he came upon the  stairs  so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people"  In this quotation we have the band of Roman soldiers at Jerusalem their office to suppress tumults the castle the stairs both as it should seem adjoining to the temple Let us enquire whether we can find these particulars in any other record of that age and place  Jos de Bell lib v c sec "Antonia was situated at the angle of the western and northern porticoes of the outer temple It was built upon a rock fifty cubits high steep on all sidesOn that side where it joined to the porticoes of the temple there were  stairs  reaching to each portico by which the  guard  descended for there was always lodged here  a Roman legion  and posting themselves in their armour in several places in the porticoes they kept a watch on the people on the feast days  to prevent all disorders  for as the temple was a guard to the city so was Antonia to the temple"  XII p Acts iv "And as they spake unto the people the priests and  the captain of the temple  and the Sadducees came upon them" Here we have a public officer under the title of captain of the temple and he probably a Jew as he accompanied the priests and Sadducees in apprehending the apostles  Jos de Bell lib ii c sec "And at the  temple  Eleazar the son of Ananias the high priest a young man of a bold and resolute disposition then  captain  persuaded those who performed the sacred ministrations not to receive the gift or sacrifice of any stranger"  XIII p Acts xxv "Then Festus when he had conferred with the  council  answered Hast thou appealed unto Cesar unto Cesar shalt thou go" That it was usual for the Roman presidents to have a council consisting of their friends and other chief Romans in the province appears expressly in the following passage of Cicero's oration against Verres"Illud negare posses aut nunc negabis te concilio tuo dimisso  viris primariis qui in consilio C Sacerdotis fuerant tibique esse volebant remotis de re judicatâ judicâsse"  XIV p Acts xvi "And at Philippi on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made" or where a proseucha oratory or place of prayer was allowed The particularity to be remarked is the situation of the place where prayer was wont to be made viz by a  river side  Philo describing the conduct of the Jews of Alexandria upon a certain public occasion relates of them that "early in the morning flocking out of the gates of the city they go to the  neighbouring shores  for the  proseuchoe  were destroyed and standing in a most pure place they lift up their voices with one accord  Philo in Flacc p  "  Josephus gives us a decree of the city of  Halicarnassus permitting the Jews to build oratories a part of which decree runs thus"We ordain that the Jews who are willing men and women do observe the sabbaths and perform sacred rites according to the Jewish laws and  build oratories by the seaside  Jos Ant lib xiv c sec  "  Tertullian among other Jewish rites and customs such as feasts sabbaths fasts and unleavened bread mentions orationes  litorales  that is prayers by the river side  Tertull ad Nat lib i c    XV p Acts xxvi "After the most  straitest  sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee"  Jos de Bell l i c sec "The Pharisees were reckoned the most religious of any of the Jews and to be the most  exact  and skilful in explaining the laws"  In the original there is an agreement  not only in the sense but in the expression it being the same Greek adjective which is rendered "strait" in the Acts and "exact" in Josephus  XVI p Mark viii "The Pharisees and all the Jews except they wash eat not holding the tradition of the elders and many other things there be which they have received to hold"  Jos Ant lib xiii c sec "The Pharisees have delivered to the people many institutions as received from the fathers which are not written in the law of Moses"  XVII p Acts xxiii "For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the Pharisees confess both"  Jos de Bell lib ii c sec "They the Pharisees believe every soul to be immortal but that the soul of the good only passes into another body and the soul of  the wicked is punished with eternal punishment" On the other hand Ant lib xviii c sec "It is the opinion of the Sadducees that souls perish with the bodies"  XVIII p Acts v "Then the High Priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the Sadducees and were filled with indignation" St Luke here intimates that the High Priest was a Sadducee which is a character one would not have expected to meet with in that station This circumstance remarkable as it is was not however without examples  Jos Ant lib xiii c sec "John Hyrcanus High Priest of the Jews forsook the Pharisees upon a disgust and joined himself to the party of the Sadducees" This High Priest died one hundred and seven years before the Christian aera  Again Ant lib xx c sec "This Ananus the younger who as we have said  just now had received the high priesthood was fierce and haughty in his behaviour and above all men bold and daring and moreover  was of the sect of the Sadducees"  This High Priest lived little more than twenty years after the transaction in the Acts  XIX p Luke ix "And it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem and sent messengers before his face And they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem"  Jos Ant lib xx c sec "It was the custom of the Galileans who went up to the holy city at the feasts to travel through the country of Samaria As they were in their journey some inhabitants of the village called Ginaea which lies on the borders of Samaria and the great plain  falling upon them killed a great many of them"  XX p John iv "Our fathers" said the Samaritan woman "worshipped in  this mountain  and ye say that Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship"  Jos Ant lib xviii c sec "Commanding them to meet him at  Mount Gerizim  which is by them the Samaritans esteemed the most sacred of all mountains"  XXI p Mat xxvi "Then assembled together the chief priests and the elders of the people unto the palace of the High Priest  who was called Caiaphas"  That Caiaphas was High Priest and High Priest throughout the presidentship of Pontius Pilate and consequently at this time appears from the following accountHe was made High Priest by Valerius Gratus  predecessor  of Pontius Pilate and was removed from his office by Vitellius president  of Syria  after  Pilate was sent away out of the province of Judea Josephus relates the  advancement  of Caiaphas to the High Priesthood in this manner "Gratus gave the High Priesthood to Simon the son of Camithus He having enjoyed this honour not above a year was succeeded by Joseph  who is also called Caiaphas  Ant lib xviii c sec  After this Gratus went away for Rome having been eleven years in Judea and  Pontius Pilate came thither as his successor"  Of the  removal  of Caiaphas from his office Josephus likewise afterward informs us and connects it with a circumstance which fixes the time to a date subsequent to the determination of Pilate's government "Vitellius he tells us ordered  Pilate to repair to Rome  and  after that  went up himself to Jerusalem and then gave directions concerning several matters And having done these things he took away the priesthood from  the High Priest  Joseph who is called  Caiaphas  Id ib c sec  "  XXII Michaelis c xi sec Acts xxiii "And they that stood by said Revilest thou God's High Priest Then said Paul I wist not brethren that he was the High Priest" Now upon enquiry into the history of the age it turns out that Ananias of whom this is spoken was in truth  not  the High Priest though he was sitting in judgement in that assumed capacity The case was that he had formerly held the office and had been deposed that the person who succeeded him had been murdered that another was not yet appointed to the station and that during the vacancy he had of his own authority taken upon himself the discharge of the office  Jos Ant l xx c v sec c vi sec c ix sec  This singular situation of the high priesthood took place during the interval between the death of Jonathan who was murdered by order of Felix and the accession of Ismael who was invested with the high priesthood by Agrippa and precisely in this interval it happened that St Paul  was apprehended and brought before the Jewish council  XXIII p Mat xxvi "Now the  chief priests  and elders and all the council sought false witness against him"  Jos Ant lib xviii c sec "Then might be seen the  high priests themselves  with ashes on their heads and their breasts naked"  The agreement here consists in speaking of the high priests or chief priests for the name in the original is the same in the  plural number  when in strictness there was only  one  High Priest which may be considered as a proof that the evangelists were habituated to the manner of speaking then in use because they retain it when it is neither accurate nor just For the sake of brevity I have put down from Josephus only a single example of the application of this title in the plural number but it is his usual style  Ib p Luke iii "Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cesar Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee  Annas and Caiaphas being the High Priests  the word of God came unto John" There is a passage in Josephus very nearly parallel to this and which may at least serve to vindicate the evangelist from objection with respect to his giving the title of High Priest specifically to two persons at the same time "Quadratus sent two others of the most powerful men of the Jews as also the  High Priests Jonathan and Ananias  De Bell lib xi c sec  " That Annas was a person in an eminent station and possessed an authority coordinate with or next to that of the High Priest properly so called may be inferred from St John's gospel which in the history of Christ's crucifixion relates that "the soldiers led him away to Annas first  xviii  " And this might be noticed  as an example of undesigned coincidence in the two evangelists  Again p Acts iv Annas is called the High Priest though Caiaphas was in the office of the High Priesthood In like manner in Josephus  De Bell ii c sec  "Joseph the son of Gorion and the High Priest Ananus were chosen to be supreme governors of all things in the city" Yet Ananus though here called the High Priest Ananus was not then in the office of the High Priesthood The truth is there is an indeterminateness in the use of this title in the gospel sometimes it is applied exclusively to the person who held the office at the time sometimes to one or two more who probably shared with him some of the powers or functions of the office and sometimes to such of the priests as were eminent by their station or character  Mark xiv  and there is the very same indeterminateness in Josephus  XXIV p John xix "And Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross" That such was the custom of the Romans upon these occasions appears from passages of Suetonius and Dio Cassius "Patrem familiascanibus objecit cum hoc  titulo  impie locutus parmularius" Suet Domit cap x And in Dio Cassius we have the following "Having led him through the midst of the court or assembly  with a writing signifying the cause of his death  and afterwards crucifying him" Book liv  Ib "And it was written in Hebrew Greek and Latin" That it was also usual about this time in Jerusalem to set up advertisements in  different  languages is gathered from the account which Josephus gives of an expostulatory message from Titus to the Jews when the city was almost in his hands in which he says Did ye not erect pillars with inscriptions on them  in the Greek and in our language  "Let no one pass beyond these bounds"  XXV p Mat xxvii "When he had  scourged  Jesus he delivered him to be crucified"  The following passages occur in Josephus  "Being  beaten  they were crucisied opposite to the citadel  Page edit Huds  "  "Whom having  first scourged with whips  he crucified  P edit  "  "He was burnt alive  having been first beaten  P edit  "  To which may be added one from Livy Lib xi c "Productique omnes  virgisque caesi  ac securi percussi"  A modern example may illustrate the use we make of this instance The preceding  of a capital execution by the corporal punishment of the sufferer is a practice unknown in England but retained in some instances at least as appears by the late execution of a regicide in Sweden This circumstance therefore in the account of an English execution purporting to come from an English writer would not only bring a suspicion upon the truth of the account but would in a considerable degree impeach its pretensions of having been written by the author whose name it bore Whereas the same circumstance in the account of a Swedish execution would verify the account and support the authenticity of the book in which it was found or at least would prove that the author whoever he was possessed the information and the knowledge which he ought to possess  XXVI p John xix "And they took Jesus and led him away and he  bearing his cross  went forth"  Plutarch De iis qui sero puniuntur p  A Paris "Every kind of wickedness produces its own particular torment just as every malefactor when he is brought forth to execution  carries his own cross"  XXVII John xix "Then came the soldiers and  brake the legs  of the first and of the other which was crucified with him"  Constantine abolished the punishment of the cross in commending which edict a heathen writer notices this very circumstance of  breaking the legs  "Eo pius ut etiam vetus veterrimumque supplicium patibulum et  cruribus suffringendis  primus removerit" Aur Vict Ces cap xli  XXVIII p Acts iii "Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the  ninth  hour"  Jos Ant Iib xv c sec "Twice every day in the morning and at the  ninth  hour the priests perform their duty at the altar"  XXIX p Acts xv "For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him  being read in the synagogues every sabbath day"  Jos contra Ap l ii "He Moses gave us the law the most excellent of all institutions nor did he appoint that it should be heard once only or twice or often but that laying aside all other works we should meet together  every week  to hear it  read  and gain a perfect understanding of it"  XXX p Acts xxi "We have four men which have a  vow  on them them take and purify thyself with them that they may  shave their heads"  Jos de Bell l xi c "It is customary for those who have been afflicted with some distemper or have laboured under any other difficulties to make a  vow  thirty days  before they offer sacrifices to abstain from wine and  shave the hair of their heads"  Ib v "Them take and purify thyself with them and  be at charges with them that they may shave their heads"  Jos Ant l xix c "He Herod Agrippa coming to Jerusalem offered up sacrifices of thanksgiving and omitted nothing that was prescribed by the law For which reason  he also ordered a good number of Nazarites to be shaved"  We here find that it was an act of piety amongst the Jews to defray for those who were under the Nazaritic vow the expences which attended its completion and that the phrase was "that they might be shaved" The custom and the expression are both remarkable and both in close conformity with the scripture account  XXXI p Cor xi "Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes  save one"  Jos Ant iv c sec "He that acts contrary hereto let him receive forty stripes  wanting one  from the public officer"  The coincidence here is singular because the law  allowed  forty stripes"Forty stripes he may give him and not exceed" Deut xxv It proves that the author of the epistle to the Corinthians was guided not by books but by facts because his statement agrees with the actual custom even when that custom deviated from the written law and from what he must have learnt by consulting the Jewish code as set forth in the Old Testament  XXXII p Luke iii "Then came also  publicans  to be baptized" From this quotation as well as from the history of Levi or Matthew Luke v and of Zaccheus Luke xix it appears that the publicans or taxgatherers were frequently at least if not always Jews which as the country was then under a Roman government and the taxes were paid to the  Romans was a circumstance not to be expected That it was the truth however of the case appears from a short passage of Josephus  De Bell lib ii c sec "But Florus not restraining these practices by his authority the chief men of the Jews  among whom was John the publican  not knowing well what course to take wait upon Florus and give him eight talents of silver to stop the building"  XXXIII p Acts xxii "And as they bound him with thongs Paul said unto the centurion that stood by Is it lawful for you  to scourge a man that is a Roman  and uncondemned"  "Facinus est vinciri civem Romanum feelus verberari" Cic in Verr  "Caedebatur virgis in medio foro Messanae civis Romanus Judices cum interea nullus gemitus nulla vox alia istius miseri  inter dolorem crepitumque plagarum audiebatur nisi haec  Civis Romanus sum  "  XXXIV p Acts xxii "Then the chief captain came and said unto him Paul Tell me Art thou a Roman He said Yea" The circumstance here to be noticed is that a  Jew  was a Roman citizen  Jos Ant lib xiv c sec "Lucius Lentulus the consul declared I have dismissed from the service  the Jewish Roman citizens  who observe the rites of the Jewish religion at Ephesus"  Ib v "And the chief captain answered With  a great sum obtained I this freedom"  Dio Cassius lib lx "This privilege which had been  bought formerly at a great price  became so cheap that it was commonly said a man might be made a Roman citizen for a few pieces of broken glass"  XXXV p Acts xxviii "And when we came to Rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with  a soldier that kept him"  With which join v "For the hope of Israel I am bound with  this chain"  "Quemadmodum eadem  catena  et custodiam et  militem  copulat sic ista quae tam dissimilia sunt pariter incedunt" Seneca ep v  "Proconsul aestimare solet utrum in carcerem recipienda sit persona an  militi tradenda"  Ulpian l i sec De custod et exhib reor  In the confinement of Agrippa by the order of Tiberius Antonia managed that the centurion who presided over the guards and the  soldier to whom Agrippa was to be bound  might be men of mild character Jos Ant lib xviii c sec After the accession  of Caligula Agrippa also like Paul was suffered to dwell yet as a prisoner in his own house  XXXVI p Acts xxvii "And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy they delivered Paul  and certain other prisoners  unto one named Julius" Since not only Paul but certain other  prisoners  were sent by the same ship into Italy the text must be considered as carrying with it an intimation that the sending of persons from Judea to be tried at Rome was an ordinary practice That in truth it was so is made out by a variety of examples which the writings of Josephus furnish and amongst others by the following which comes near both to the time and the subject of the instance in the Acts "Felix for some slight offence  bound and sent to Rome  several priests of his acquaintance and very good and honest men to answer for themselves to Cesar" Jos in Vit sec  XXXVII p Acts xi "And  in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch and there stood up one of them named Agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be a great dearth throughout all the world or all the country  which came to pass in the days of Claudius Cesar"  Jos Ant l xx c sec "In their time i e about the fifth or sixth year of Claudius a great dearth happened in Judea"  XXXVIII p Acts xviii "Because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome"  Suet Claud c xxv "Judaeos impulsore Chresto assiduè tumultuantes Româ expulit"  XXXIX p Acts v "After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him"  Jos de Bell l vii "He viz the person  who in another place is called by Josephus Judas the Galilean or Judas of Galilee persuaded not a few not to enroll themselves when Cyrenius the censor was sent into Judea"  XL p Acts xxi "Art not thou that Egyptian which before these days madest an uprore and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers"  Jos de Bell l ii c sec "But the Egyptian false prophet brought a yet heavier disaster upon the Jews for this impostor coming into the country and gaining the reputation of a prophet gathered together thirty thousand men who were deceived by him Having brought them round out of the wilderness up to the mount of olives he intended from thence to make his attack upon Jerusalem but Felix coming suddenly upon him with the Roman soldiers prevented the attackA great number or as it should rather be rendered the greatest  part of those that were with him were either slain or taken prisoners"  In these two passages the designation of the impostor an "Egyptian" without his proper name "the wilderness" his escape though his followers were destroyed the time of the transaction in the presidentship of Felix which could not be any long time before the words in Luke are supposed to have been spoken are circumstances of close correspondency There is one and only one point of disagreement and that is in the number of his followers which in the Acts are called four thousand and by Josephus thirty thousand but beside that the names of numbers more than any other words are  able to the errors of transcribers we are in the present instance under the less concern to reconcile the evangelist with Josephus as Josephus is not in this point consistent with himself For whereas in the passage here quoted he calls the number thirty thousand and tells us that the greatest part or a great number according as  his words are rendered of those that were with him were destroyed in his Antiquities he represents four hundred to have been killed upon this occasion and two hundred taken prisoners  Lib xx c sec  which certainly was not the "greatest part" nor "a great part" nor "a great number" out of thirty thousand It is probable also that Lysias and Josephus spoke of the expedition in its different stages Lysias of those who followed the Egyptian out of Jerusalem Josephus of all who were collected about him afterwards from different quarters  XLI Lardner's Jewish and Heathen Testimonies vol iii p Acts xvii "Then Paul stood in the midst of Marshill and said Ye men of Athens I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious for as I passed by and beheld your devotions  I found an altar with this inscription TO THE UNKNOWN GOD  Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare I unto you"  Diogenes Laertius  who wrote about the year in his history of Epimenides who is supposed to have flourished nearly six hundred years before Christ relates of him the following story that being invited to Athens for the purpose he delivered the city from a pestilence in this manner"Taking several sheep some black others white he had them up to the Areopagus and then let them go where they would and gave orders to those who followed them wherever any of them should lie down to sacrifice it to the god to whom it belonged and so the plague ceased Hence" says the historian "it has come to pass  that to this present time may be found in the boroughs of the Athenians  ANONYMOUS  altars  a memorial of the expiation then made  In Epimenide l i segm  " These altars it may be presumed were called  anonymous  because there was not the name of any particular deity inscribed upon them  Pausanias  who wrote before the end of  the second century in his description of Athens having mentioned an altar of Jupiter Olympius adds  "And nigh unto it is an altar of unknown gods  Paus l v p  " And in another place speaks  "of altars of gods called unknown  Ib l i p  "  Philostratus  who wrote in the beginning of the third century records it as an observation of Apollonius Tyanaeus "That it was wise to speak well of all the gods  especially at Athens where altars of unknown demons were erected  Philos Apoll Tyan l vi c  "  The  author of the dialogue Philopatris  by many supposed to have been Lucian who wrote about the year by others some anonymous heathen writer of the fourth century makes Critias swear  by the unknown god of Athens  and near the end of the dialogue has these words "But let us find out  the unknown god at Athens  and stretching our  hands to heaven offer to him our praises and thanksgivings  Lucian in Philop tom ii Graev p  "  This is a very curious and a very important coincidence It appears beyond controversy that altars with this inscription were existing at Athens at the time when St Paul is alledged to have been there It seems also which is very worthy of observation that this inscription was  peculiar  to the Athenians There is no evidence that there were altars inscribed "to the unknown God" in any other country Supposing the history of St Paul to have been a fable how is it possible that such a writer as the author of the Acts of the Apostles was should hit upon a circumstance so extraordinary and introduce it by an allusion so suitable to St Paul's office and character  The examples here collected will be sufficient I hope to satisfy us that the writers  of the Christian history knew something of what they were writing about The argument is also strengthened by the following considerations  I That these agreements appear not only in articles of public history but sometimes in minute recondite and very peculiar circumstances in which of all others a forger is most likely to have been found tripping  II That the destruction of Jerusalem which took place forty years after the commencement of the Christian institution produced such a change in the state of the country and the condition of the Jews that a writer who was unacquainted with the circumstances of the nation  before  that event would find it difficult to avoid mistakes in endeavouring to give detailed accounts of transactions connected with those circumstances forasmuch as he could no longer have a living exemplar to copy from  III That there appears in the writers of  the New Testament a knowledge of the affairs of those times which we do not find in authors of later ages In particular many of the Christian writers of the second and third centuries and of the following ages had false notions concerning the state of Judea between the nativity of Jesus and the destruction of Jerusalem  Lard part i vol ii p  Therefore  they  could not have composed our histories  Amidst so many conformities we are not to wonder that we meet with some difficulties The principal of these I will put down together with the solutions which they have received But in doing this I must be contented with a brevity better suited to the limits of my volume than to the nature of a controversial argument For the historical proofs of my assertions and for the Greek criticisms upon which some of them are founded I refer the reader to the second volume of the first part of Dr Lardner's large work  I The taxing during which Jesus was born was "first made" as we read according to our translation in St Luke "whilst Cyrenius was governor of Syria  Chap ii ver  " Now it turns out that Cyrenius was not governor of Syria until twelve or at the soonest ten years after the birth of Christ and that a taxing census or assessment was made in Judea in the beginning of his government The charge therefore brought against the evangelist is that intending to refer to this taxing he has misplaced the date of it by an error of ten or twelve years  The answer to the accusation is found in his using the word "first""And this taxing was  first  made" for according to the mistake imputed to the evangelist this word could have no signification whatever it could have had no place in his narrative because let it relate to what it will taxing census enrollment or assessment it imports that the writer had more than one of these  in contemplation It acquits him therefore of the charge it is inconsistent with the supposition of his knowing only of the taxing in the beginning of Cyrenius's government And if the evangelist knew which this word proves that he did of some other taxing beside that it is too much for the sake of convicting him of a mistake to lay it down as certain that he intended to refer to  that  The sentence in St Luke may be construed thus "This was the first assessment or enrollment of Cyrenius governor of Syria  If the word which we render "first" be rendered "before" which it has been strongly contended that the Greek idiom allows of the whole difficulty vanishes for then the passage would be"Now this taxing was made before Cyrenius was governor of Syria" which corresponds with the chronology But I rather choose to argue that however the word "first" be rendered to give it a meaning at all it militates with the objection In this I think there can be no mistake  " the words "governor of Syria" being used after the name of Cyrenius as his  addition or title And this title belonging to him at the time of writing the account was naturally enough subjoined to his name though acquired after the transaction which the account describes A modern writer who was not very exact in the choice of his expressions in relating the affairs of the EastIndies might easily say that such a thing was done by  Governor  Hastings though in truth the thing had been done by him before his advancement to the station from which he received the name of governor And this as we contend is precisely the inaccuracy which has produced the difficulty in St Luke  At any rate it appears from the form of the expression that he had two taxings or enrollments in contemplation And if Cyrenius had been sent upon this business into Judea before he became governor of Syria against which supposition there is no proof but rather external evidence of an enrollment going on about this time under some  person or other  Josephus Ant xvii c sec has this remarkable passage"When therefore the whole Jewish nation took an oath to be faithful to Cesar and the interests of the king" This transaction corresponds in the course of the history with the time of Christ's birth What is called a census and which we render taxing was delivering upon oath an account of their property This might be accompanied with an oath of fidelity or might be mistaken by Josephus for it  then the census on all hands acknowledged to have been made by him in the beginning of his government would form a second so as to occasion the other to be called the  first  II Another chronological objection arises upon a date assigned in the beginning of the third chapter of St Luke  Lard part i vol ii p  "Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius CaesarJesus  began to be about thirty  years of age" for supposing Jesus to have been born as St Matthew and St Luke also himself relates in the time of Herod he must according to the dates given in Josephus and by the Roman historians have  been at least thirtyone years of age in the fifteenth year of Tiberius If he was born as St Matthew's narrative intimates one or two years before Herod's death he would have been thirtytwo or thirtythree years old at that time  This is the difficulty the solution turns upon an alteration in the construction of the Greek St Luke's words in the original are allowed by the general opinion of learned men to signify not "that Jesus began to be about thirty years of age" but "that he was about thirty years of age when he began his ministry" This construction being admitted the adverb "about" gives us all the latitude we want and more especially when applied as it is in the present instance to a decimal number for such numbers even without this qualifying addition are often used in a laxer sense than is here contended for  Livy speaking of the peace which the conduct of Romulus had procured to the state during the  whole  reign of his successor  Liv Hist c i sec  Numa has these words"Ab illo enim profectis viribus datis tantum valuit ut in  quadraginta  deinde annos tutam pacem haberet" yet afterwards in the same chapter "Romulus he says septem et triginta regnavit annos Numa tres et quadraginta"    III Acts v "For before these days rose up Theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought"  Josephus has preserved the account of an impostor of the name of Theudas who created some disturbances and was slain but according to the date assigned to this man's appearance in which however it is very possible that Josephus may have been mistaken  Michaelis's Introduction to the New Testament Marsh's translation vol i p  it must have been at the least seven years after Gamaliel's speech  of which this text is a part was delivered It has been replied to the objection  Lardner part i vol ii p  that there might be two impostors of this name and it has been observed in order to give a general probability to the solution that the same thing appears to have happened in other instances of the same kind It is proved from Josephus that there were not fewer than four persons of the name of Simon within forty years and not fewer than three of the name of Judas within ten years who were all leaders of insurrections and it is likewise recorded by this historian that upon the death of Herod the Great which agrees very well with the time of the commotion referred to by Gamaliel and with his manner of stating that time "before these days" there were innumerable disturbances in Judea  Ant l xvii c sec  Archbishop Usher was of opinion that one of the three Judas's above mentioned was Gamaliel's Theudas  Annals p  and that with a less variation  of the name than we actually find in the gospels where one of the twelve apostles is called by Luke Judas and by Mark Thaddeus  Luke vi Mark iii  Origen however he came at his information appears to have believed that there was an impostor of the name of Theudas before the nativity of Christ  Or con Cels p    IV Matt xxiii "Wherefore behold I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of  Zacharias son of Barachias whom ye slew between the temple and the altar"  There is a Zacharias whose death is related in the second book of Chronicles in  a manner which perfectly supports our Saviour's allusion  "And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest which stood above the people and said unto them Thus saith God Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord that ye cannot prosper Because ye have forsaken the Lord he hath also forsaken you And they conspired against him  and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord"  Chron xxiv  But this Zacharias was the son of  Jehoiada  There is also Zacharias the prophet who was the son of Barachiah and is so described in the superscription of his prophecy but of whose death we have no account  I have little doubt but that the first Zacharias was the person spoken of by our Saviour and that the name of the father has been since added or changed by some one who took it from the title of the prophecy which happened to be better known to him than the history in the Chronicles  There is likewise a Zacharias the son of Baruch related by Josephus to have been slain in the temple a few years before the destruction of Jerusalem It has been insinuated that the words put into our Saviour's mouth contain a reference to this transaction and were composed by some writer who either confounded the time of the transaction with our Saviour's age or inadvertently overlooked the anachronism  Now suppose it to have been so suppose these words to have been suggested by the transaction related in Josephus and to have been falsely ascribed to Christ and observe what extraordinary coincidences accidentally as it must in that case have been attend the forger's mistake  First That we have a Zacharias in the book of Chronicles whose death and the manner of it corresponds with the allusion  Secondly that although the name of this person's father be erroneously put down in  the gospel yet we have a way of accounting for the error by shewing another Zacharias in the Jewish scriptures much better known than the former whose patronymic was actually that which appears in the text  Every one who thinks upon the subject will find these to be circumstances which could not have met together in a mistake which did not proceed from the circumstances themselves  I have noticed I think all the difficulties of this kind They are few some of them admit of a clear others of a probable solution The reader will compare them with the number the variety the closeness and the satisfactoriness of the instances which are to be set against them and he will remember the scantiness in many cases of our intelligence and that difficulties always attend imperfect information  CHAP VII Undesigned Coincidences  BETWEEN the letters which bear the name of St Paul in our collection and his history in the Acts of the Apostles there exist many notes of correspondency The simple perusal of the writings is sufficient to prove that neither the history was taken from the letters nor the letters from the history And the  undesignedness  of the agreements which undesignedness is gathered from their latency their minuteness their obliquity the suitableness of the circumstances in which they consist to the places in which those circumstances occur and the circuitous references by which they are traced out demonstrates that they have not been produced by meditation or by any fraudulent contrivance But coincidences from which these causes are excluded and  which are too close and numerous to be accounted for by accidental concurrences of fiction must necessarily have truth for their foundation  This argument appeared to my mind of so much value especially for its assuming nothing beside the existence of the books that I have pursued it through St Paul's thirteen epistles in a work published by me four years ago under the title of Horae Paulinae I am sensible how feebly any argument which depends upon an induction of particulars is represented without examples On which account I wished to have abridged my own volume in the manner in which I have treated Dr Lardner's in the preceding chapter But upon making the attempt I did not find it in my power to render the articles intelligible by fewer words than I have there used I must be content therefore to refer the reader to the work itself And I would particularly invite his attention to the observations which are made in it upon the three first epistles  I persuade myself that he will find the proofs both of agreement and undesignedness supplied by these epistles sufficient to support the conclusion which is there maintained in favour both of the genuineness of the writings and the truth of the narrative  It remains only in this place to point out how the argument  bears  upon the general question of the Christian history  First St Paul in these letters affirms in unequivocal terms his own performance of miracles and what ought particularly to be remembered  "That miracles were the signs of an apostle  Rom xv Cor xii  " If this testimony come from St Paul's own hand it is invaluable And that it does so the argument before us fixes in my mind a firm assurance  Secondly it shows that the series of action represented in the epistles of St Paul was real which alone lays a foundation  for the proposition which forms the subject of the first part of our present work viz that the original witnesses of the Christian history devoted themselves to lives of toil suffering and danger in consequence of their belief of the truth of that history and for the sake of communicating the knowledge of it to others  Thirdly it proves that Luke or whoever was the author of the Acts of the Apostles for the argument does not depend upon the name of the author though I know no reason for questioning it was well acquainted with St Paul's history and that he probably was what he professes himself to be a companion of St Paul's travels which if true establishes in a considerable degree the credit even of his gospel because it shews that the writer from his time situation and connections possessed opportunities of informing himself truly concerning the transactions which he relates I have little difficulty in applying to the Gospel of St Luke what is proved concerning the  Acts of the Apostles considering them as two parts of the same history for though there are instances of  second  parts being forgeries I know none where the second part is genuine and the first not so  I will only observe as a sequel of the argument though not noticed in my work the remarkable similitude between the style of St John's gospel and of St John's first epistle The style of St John's is not at all the style of St Paul's epistles though both are very singular nor is it the style of St James's or of St Peter's epistle but it bears a resemblance to the style of the gospel inscribed with St John's name so far as that resemblance can be expected to appear which is not in simple narrative so much as in reflections and in the representation of discourses Writings so circumstanced prove themselves and one another to be genuine This correspondency is the more valuable as the epistle itself asserts in St John's manner indeed but in terms sufficiently explicit the writer's personal knowledge  of Christ's history "That which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you  C i v  " Who would not desire who perceives not the value of an account delivered by a writer so well informed as this  CHAP VIII Of the History of the Resurrection  THE history of the resurrection of Christ is a part of the evidence of Christianity but I do not know whether the proper strength of this passage of the Christian history or wherein its peculiar value as a head of evidence consists be generally understood It is not that as a miracle the resurrection ought to be accounted a more decisive proof of supernatural agency than other miracles are it is not that as it stands in the Gospels it is better attested than some others it is not for either of these reasons that more weight belongs to it than to other miracles but for the following viz That it is completely certain that the apostles of Christ and the first teachers of Christianity asserted the fact And this would have been certain if the four gospels had been lost or never written Every piece of scripture recognizes  the resurrection Every epistle of every apostle every author contemporary with the apostles of the age immediately succeeding the apostles every writing from that age to the present genuine or spurious on the side of Christianity or against it concur in representing the resurrection of Christ as an article of his history received without doubt or disagreement by all who called themselves Christians as alledged from the beginning by the propagators of the institution and alledged as the center of their testimony Nothing I apprehend which a man does not himself see or hear can be more certain to him than this point I do not mean that nothing can be more certain than that Christ rose from the dead but that nothing can be more certain than that his apostles and the first teachers of Christianity gave out that he did so In the other parts of the gospel narrative a question may be made whether the things related of Christ be the very things which the apostles and first teachers of the religion delivered concerning him And this question depends  a good deal upon the evidence we possess of the genuineness or rather perhaps of the antiquity credit and reception of the books Upon the subject of the resurrection no such discussion is necessary because no such doubt can be entertained The only points which can enter into our consideration are whether the apostles knowingly published a falsehood or whether they were themselves deceived whether either of these suppositions be possible The first I think is pretty generally given up The nature of the undertaking and of the men the extreme unlikelihood that such men should engage in such a measure as a  scheme  their personal toils and dangers and sufferings in the cause their appropriation of their whole time to the object the warm and seemingly unaffected zeal and earnestness with which they profess their sincerity exempt their memory from the suspicion of imposture The solution more deserving of notice is that which would resolve the conduct of the apostles into  enthusiasm  which would class the evidence of Christ's resurrection with  the numerous stories that are extant of the apparitions of dead men There are circumstances in the narrative as it is preserved in our histories which destroy this comparison entirely It was not one person but many who saw him they saw him not only separately but together not only by night but by day not at a distance but near not once but several times they not only saw him but touched him conversed with him eat with him examined his person to satisfy their doubts These particulars are decisive but they stand I do admit upon the credit of our records I would answer therefore the insinuation of enthusiasm by a circumstance which arises out of the nature of the thing and the reality of which must be confessed by all who allow what I believe is not denied that the resurrection of Christ whether true or false was asserted by his disciples from the beginning and that circumstance is the nonproduction of the dead body It is related in the history what indeed the story of the resurrection necessarily implies that the  corpse was missing out of the sepulchre it is related also in the history that the Jews reported that the followers of Christ had stolen it away  "And this saying" St Matthew writes "is commonly reported amongst the Jews until this day" xxviii The evangelist may be thought good authority as to this point even by those who do not admit his evidence in every other point and this point is sufficient to prove that the body was missing  It has also been rightly I think observed by Dr Townsend Dis upon the Res p that the story of the guards carried collusion upon the face of it"His disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept" Men in their circumstances would not have made such an acknowledgement of their negligence without previous assurances of protection and impunity  And this account though loaded with great improbabilities such as the situation of the disciples their fears for their own safety at the time the unlikelihood of their expecting to succeed the difficulty of actual success  "Especially at the full moon the city full of people many probably passing the whole night as Jesus and his disciples had done in the open air the sepulchre so near the city as to be now inclosed within the walls" Priestley on the Resur p  and the inevitable  consequence of detection and failure was nevertheless the most credible account that could be given of the matter But it proceeds entirely upon the supposition of fraud as all the old objections did What account can be given of the  body  upon the supposition of enthusiasm It is impossible our Lord's followers could believe that he was risen from the dead if his corpse was lying before them No enthusiasm ever reached to such a pitch of extravagancy as that a spirit may be an illusion a body is a real thing an object of sense in which there can be no mistake All accounts of spectres leave the body in the grave And although the body of Christ might be removed by  fraud  and for the purposes of fraud yet without any such intention and by sincere but deluded men which is the representation of the apostolic character we are now examining no such attempt could be made The presence and the absence of the dead body are alike inconsistent with the hypothesis of enthusiasm for if present it must have cured their enthusiasm at once if absent  fraud not enthusiasm must have carried it away  But further if we admit upon the concurrent testimony of all the histories so much of the account as states that the religion of Jesus was set up at Jerusalem and set up with asserting in the very place in which he had been buried and a few days after he had been buried his resurrection out of the grave it is evident that if his body could have been found the Jews would have produced it as the shortest and completest answer possible to the whole story The attempt of the apostles could not have survived this refutation a moment If we also admit upon the authority of St Matthew that the Jews were advertised of the expectation of Christ's followers and that they had taken due precaution in consequence of this notice and that the body was in marked and public custody the observation receives more force still For notwithstanding their precaution and although thus prepared and forewarned when the story  of the resurrection of Christ came forth as it immediately did when it was publicly asserted by his disciples and made the ground and basis of their preaching in his name and collecting followers to his religion the Jews had not the body to produce but were obliged to meet the testimony of the apostles by an answer not containing indeed any impossibility in itself but absolutely inconsistent with the supposition of their integrity that is in other words inconsistent with the supposition which would resolve their conduct into enthusiasm  CHAP IX The Propagation of Christianity  IN this argument the first consideration is the fact in what degree within what time and to what extent Christianity actually was propagated  The accounts of the matter which can be collected from our books are as follow A  few days  after Christ's disappearance out of the world we find an assembly of disciples at Jerusalem to the number of "about one hundred and twenty  Acts i  " which hundred and twenty were probably a little association of believers met together not merely as believers in Christ but as personally connected with the apostles and with one another Whatever was the number of believers  then in Jerusalem we have no reason to be surprised that so small a company should assemble for there is no proof that the followers of Christ were yet formed into a society that the society was reduced into any order that it was at this time even understood that a new religion in the sense which that term conveys to us was to be set up in the world or how the professors of that religion were to be distinguished from the rest of mankind The death of Christ had left we may suppose the generality of his disciples in great doubt both as to what they were to do and concerning what was to follow  This meeting was held as we have already said a few days after Christ's ascension for ten days after that event was the day of pentecost when as our history relates  Acts ii  upon a signal display of divine agency attending the persons of the apostles there were added to the society "about  three thousand souls  Acts ii  " But here it is not I think to be taken that these three thousand were all converted by this single miracle but rather that many who were before believers in Christ became now professors of Christianity that is to say when they found that a religion was to be established a society formed and set up in the name of Christ governed by his laws avowing their belief in his mission united amongst themselves and separated from the rest of the world by visible distinctions in pursuance of their former conviction and by virtue of what they had heard and seen and known of Christ's history they publicly became members of it  We read in the fourth  Verse  chapter of the Acts that soon after this "the number of the men"  i e  of the society openly professing their belief in Christ "was about five thousand" So that here is an increase of two thousand within a very short time And it is probable that there were many  both now and afterwards who although they believed in Christ did not think it necessary to join themselves to this society or who waited to see what was likely to become of it Gamaliel whose advice to the Jewish council is recorded Acts iv appears to have been of this description perhaps Nicodemus and perhaps also Joseph of Arimathea This class of men their character and their rank are likewise pointed out by St John in the twelfth chapter of his gospel "Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God" Persons such as these might admit the miracles of Christ without being immediately convinced that they were under obligation to make a public profession of Christianity at the risk of all that was dear to them in life and even of life itself  "Beside those who professed and those who rejected and opposed Christianity there were in all probability multitudes between both neither perfect Christians nor yet unbelievers They had a favourable opinion of the gospel but wordly considerations made them unwilling to own it There were many circumstances which inclined them to think that Christianity was a divine revelation but there were many inconveniences which attended the open profession of it and they could not find in themselves courage enough to bear them to disoblige their friends and family to ruin their fortunes to lose their reputation their liberty and their life for the sake of the new religion Therefore they were willing to hope that if they endeavoured to observe the great precepts of morality which Christ had represented as the principal part the sum and substance of religion if they thought honourably of the gospel if they offered no injury to the Christians if they did them all the services that they could  safely  perform they were willing to hope that God would accept this and that he would excuse and forgive the rest" Jortin's Dis on the Christ Rel p ed    Christianity however proceeded to increase in Jerusalem by a progress equally rapid with its first success for in the next  Acts v  chapter of our history we read that "believers were the more added to the Lord  multitudes  both of men and women" And  this enlargement of the new society appears in the first verse of the succeeding chapter wherein we are told that "when the number of the disciples was  multiplied  there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected  Acts vi  " and afterwards in the same chapter it is declared expressly that "the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and that a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith"  This I call the first period in the propagation of Christianity It commences with the ascension of Christ and extends as may be collected from incidental notes of time  Vide Pearson's Antiq l xviii c Benson's Hist of Christ book i p  to something more than one year after that event During which term the preaching of Christianity so far as our documents inform us was confined to the single city of Jerusalem And how did it succeed there The first assembly which we  meet with of Christ's disciples and that a few days after his removal from the world consisted of "one hundred and twenty" About a week after this "three thousand were added" in one day and the number of Christians publicly baptized and publicly associating together were very soon increased to "five thousand" "Multitudes both of men and women continued to be added" "disciples multiplied greatly" and "many of the Jewish priesthood as well as others became obedient to the faith" and this within a space of less than two years from the commencement of the institution  By reason of a persecution raised against the church at Jerusalem the converts were driven from that city and dispersed throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria  Acts viii  Wherever they came they brought their religion with them for our historian informs us  Verse  that "they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word"  The effect of this preaching comes afterwards to be noticed where the historian is led in the course of his narrative to observe that  then i e  about three years  Benson book i p  posterior to this "the churches had rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria and were edisied and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost were multiplied" This was the work of the second period which comprises about four years  Hitherto the preaching of the gospel had been consined to Jews to Jewish proselytes and to Samaritans And I cannot forbear from setting down in this place an observation of Mr Bryant's which appears to me to be perfectly well founded"The Jews still remain but how seldom is it that we can make a single proselyte There is reason to think that there were more converted by the apostles in one day than have  since been won over in the last thousand years  Bryant on the Truth of the Christian Religion p  "  It was not yet known to the apostles that they were at liberty to propose the religion to mankind at large That "mystery" as St Paul calls it  Eph iii  and as it then was was revealed to Peter by an especial miracle It appears to have been  Benson b ii p  about seven years after Christ's ascension that the gospel was preached to the Gentiles of Cesarea A year after this a great multitude of Gentiles were converted at Antioch in Syria The expressions employed by the historian are these"a great number believed and turned to the Lord" "much people was added unto the Lord" "the apostles Barnabas and Paul taught much people  Acts xi  " Upon Herod's death which happened in the next year  Benson b ii p  it is observed that "the word of God grew  and multiplied  Acts xii  " Three years from this time upon the preaching of Paul at Iconium the metropolis of Lycaonia "a great multitude both of Jews and Greeks believed  Ib xiv  " and afterwards in the course of this very progress he is represented as "making many disciples" at Derbe a principal city in the same district Three years  Benson's Hist Christ b iii p  after this which brings us to sixteen after the ascension the apostles wrote a public letter from Jerusalem to the Gentile converts in Antioch Syria and Cilicia with which letter Paul travelled through these countries and found the churches "established in the faith and increasing in number daily  Acts xvi  " From Asia the apostle proceeded into Greece where soon after his arrival in Macedonia we find him at Thessalonica in which city "some of the Jews believed and of the devout Greeks a great multitude  Ib xvii  " We meet also here with an  accidental hint of the general progress of the Christian mission in the exclamation of the tumultuous Jews of Thessalonica "that they who had turned the world upside down were come thither also  Acts v  " At Berea the next city at which St Paul arrives the historian who was present informs us that  "many  of the Jews believed  Ib xvii  " The next year and half of St Paul's ministry was spent at Corinth Of his success in that city we receive the following intimations "that  many  of the Corinthians believed and were baptized" and "that it was revealed to the apostle by Christ that he had  much  people in the city  Ib xviii  " Within less than a year after his departure from Corinth and twentyfive  Benson b iii p  years after the ascension St Paul fixed his station at Ephesus for the space of two years  Acts xix  and something more The effect of his ministry in that city and neighbourhood drew from the historian a reflection "how mightily grew the word of God and  prevailed  Acts xix  " And at the conclusion of this period we find Demetrius at the head of a party who were alarmed by the progress of the religion complaining that "not only at Ephesus but also throughout all Asia  i e  the province of Lydia and the country adjoining to Ephesus this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people  Ib v  " Beside these accounts there occurs incidentally mention of converts at Rome Alexandria Athens Cyprus Cyrene Macedonia Philippi  This is the third period in the propagation of Christianity setting off in the seventh year after the ascension and ending at the twentyeighth Now lay these three periods together and observe how the progress of the religion by these accounts is represented The institution which properly  began  only after its author's removal from the world before the end of thirty years had spread itself through Judea Galilee  and Samaria almost all the numerous districts of the Lesser Asia through Greece and the islands of the Aegean Sea the sea coast of Africa and had extended itself to Rome and into Italy At Antioch in Syria at Joppa Ephesus Corinth Thessalonica Berea Iconium Derbe Antioch in Pisidia at Lydda Saron the number of converts is intimated by the expressions "a great number" great multitudes" "much people" Converts are mentioned without any designation of their number  Considering the extreme conciseness of many parts of the history the silence about the numbers of converts is no proof of their paucity for at Philippi no mention whatever is made of the number yet St Paul addressed an epistle to that church The churches of Galatia and the affairs of those churches were considerable enough to be the subject of another letter and of much of St Paul's solicitude yet no account is preserved in the history of his success or even of his preaching in that country except the slight notice which these words convey"when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia they essayed to go into Bythinia" Acts xvi  at Tyre Cesarea Troas Athens Philippi Lystra Damascus  During all this time Jerusalem continued not only the centre of the mission but a principal seat of the religion for when St Paul returned thither at the conclusion of the period of which we are now considering the accounts the other apostles pointed out to him as a reason for his compliance with their advice "how many thousands myriads ten thousands there were in that city who believed  Acts xxi  "  Upon this abstract and the writing from which it is drawn the following observations seem material to be made  I That the account comes from a person who was himself concerned in a portion of what he relates and was contemporary with the whole of it who visited Jerusalem and frequented the society of those who had acted and were acting the chief parts in the transaction I lay down this point positively  for had the ancient attestations to this valuable record been less satisfactory than they are the unaffectedness and simplicity with which the author notices his presence upon certain occasions and the entire absence of art and design from these notices would have been sufficient to persuade my mind that whoever he was he actually lived in the times and occupied the situation in which he represents himself to be When I say "whoever he was" I do not mean to cast a doubt upon the name to which antiquity hath ascribed the Acts of the Apostles for there is no cause that I am acquainted with for questioning it but to observe that in such a case as this the time and situation of the author is of more importance than his name and that  these  appear from the work itself and in the most unsuspicious form  II That this account is a very  incomplete  account of the preaching and propagation of Christianity I mean that if what we read in the history be true much more  than what the history contains must be true also For although the narrative from which our information is derived has been intitled the Acts of the Apostles it is in fact a history of the twelve apostles only during a short time of their continuing together at Jerusalem and even of this period the account is very concise The work afterwards consists of a few important passages of Peter's ministry of the speech and death of Stephen of the preaching of Philip the deacon and the sequel of the volume that is two thirds of the whole is taken up with the conversion the travels the discourses and history of the new apostle Paul in which history also large portions of time are often passed over with very scanty notice  III That the account so far as it goes is for this very reason more credible Had it been the author's design to have  displayed  the early progress of Christianity he would undoubtedly have collected or at least have set forth accounts of the preaching of the rest of the apostles who cannot without extreme  improbability be supposed to have remained silent and inactive or not to have met with a share of that success which attended their colleagues To which may be added as an observation of the same kind  IV That the intimations of the number of converts and of the success of the preaching of the apostles come out for the most part  incidentally  are drawn from the historian by the occasion such as the murmuring of the Grecian converts the rest from persecution Herod's death the sending of Barnabas to Antioch and Barnabas calling Paul to his assistance Paul coming to a place and finding there disciples the clamour of the Jews the complaint of artificers interested in the support of the popular religion the reason assigned to induce Paul to give satisfaction to the Christians of Jerusalem Had it not been for these occasions it is probable that no notice whatever would have been taken of the number of converts in several of the passages in which that notice now appears All this tends to remove  the suspicion of a design to exaggerate or deceive  PARALLEL TESTIMONIES with the history are the letters which have come down to us of St Paul and of the other apostles Those of St Paul are addressed to the churches of Corinth Philippi Thessalonica the church of Galatia and if the inscription be right of Ephesus his ministry at all which places is recorded in the history to the church of Colosse or rather to the churches of Colosse and Laodicea jointly which he had not then visited They recognize by reference the churches of Judea the churches of Asia and "all the churches of the Gentiles  Thess ii  " In the epistle  Rom xv  to the Romans the author is led to deliver a remarkable declaration concerning the extent of his preaching its efficacy and the cause to which he ascribes it "to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed through mighty signs and wonders by the power of  the Spirit of God so that from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ" In the epistle to the Colossians  Col i  we find an oblique but very strong signification of the then general state of the Christian mission at least as it appeared to St Paul "If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and  which was preached to every creature which is under heaven"  which gospel he had reminded them near the beginning  Ib i  of his letter "was present with them  as it was in all the world"  The expressions are hyperbolical but they are hyperboles which could only be used by a writer who entertained a strong sense of the subject The first epistle of Peter accosts the Christians dispersed throughout Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia  It comes next to be considered how far  these accounts are confirmed or followed up by other evidence  Tacitus in delivering a relation which has already been laid before the reader of the fire which happened at Rome in the tenth year of Nero which coincides with the thirtieth year after Christ's ascension asserts that the emperor in order to suppress the rumours of having been himself the author of the mischief procured the Christians to be accused Of which Christians thus brought into his narrative the following is so much of the historian's account as belongs to our present purpose "They had their denomination from Christus who in the reign of Tiberius was put to death as a criminal by the procurator Pontius Pilate This pernicious superstition though checked for a while broke out again and spread not only over Judea but reached the city also At first they only were apprehended who confessed themselves of that sect afterwards  a vast multitude  were discovered by them" This testimony to the early propagation of  Christianity is extremely material It is from an historian of great reputation living near the time from a stranger and an enemy to the religion and it joins immediately with the period through which the scripture accounts extend It establishes these points that the religion began at Jerusalem that it spread throughout Judea that it had reached Rome and not only so but that it had there obtained a great number of converts This was about six years after the time that St Paul wrote his epistle to the Romans and something more than two years after he arrived there himself▪ The converts to the religion were then so numerous at Rome that of those who were betrayed by the information of the persons first persecuted a great multitude multitudo ingens were discovered and seized  It seems probable that the temporary check which Tacitus represents Christianity to have received repressa in praesens referred to the persecution at Jerusalem which followed the death of Stephen Acts viii  and which by dispersing the converts caused the institution in some measure to disappear Its second eruption at the same place and within a short time has much in it of the character of truth It was the firmness and perseverance of men who knew what they relied upon  Next in order of time and perhaps superior in importance is the testimony of Pliny the younger Pliny was the Roman governor of Pontus and Bithynia two considerable districts in the northern part of Asia Minor The situation in which he found his province led him to apply to the emperor Trajan for his direction as to the conduct he was to hold towards the Christians The letter in which this application is contained was written not quite eighty years after Christ's ascension The president in this letter states the measures he had already pursued and then adds as his reason for resorting to the emperor's counsel and authority the following words"Suspending all judicial proceedings I have recourse to  you for advice for it has appeared to me a matter highly deserving consideration especially upon account of the great number of persons who are in danger of suffering for many of all ages and of every rank of both sexes likewise are accused and will be accused Nor has the contagion of this superstition seized cities only but the lesser towns also and the open country Nevertheless it seemed to me that it may be restrained and corrected It is certain that the temples which were almost forsaken begin to be more frequented and the sacred solemnities after a long intermission are revived Victims likewise are everywhere passim bought up whereas for some time there were few to purchase them Whence it is easy to imagine what numbers of men might be reclaimed if pardon were granted to those that shall repent  C Plin Trajano Imp lib x ep xcvii  "  It is obvious to observe that the passage of Pliny's letter here quoted proves not  only that the Christians in Pontus and Bithynia were now numerous but that they had subsisted there for some considerable time "It is certain he says that the temples which were almost forsaken plainly ascribing this desertion of the popular worship to the prevalency of Christianity begin to be more frequented and the sacred solemnities after a  long  intermission are revived" There are also two clauses in the former part of the letter which indicate the same thing one in which he declares that he had "never been present at any trials of Christians and therefore knew not what was the usual subject of enquiry and punishment or how far either was wont to be urged" the second clause is the following "others were named by an informer who at first confessed themselves Christians and afterwards denied it the rest said they had been Christians some three years ago some longer and some above twenty years" It is also apparent that Pliny speaks of the Christians as a description of men well known to the person to whom he writes  His first sentence concerning them is "I have never been present at the trials of Christians" This mention of the name of Christians without any preparatory explanation shews that it was a term familiar both to the writer of the letter and the person to whom it was addressed Had it not been so Pliny would naturally have begun his letter by informing the emperor that he had met with a certain set of men in the province called Christians  Here then is a very signal evidence of the progress of the Christian religion in a short space It was not fourscore years after the crucifixion of Jesus when Pliny wrote this letter nor seventy years since the apostles of Jesus began to mention his name to the Gentile world Bithynia and Pontus were at a great distance from Judea the centre from which the religion spread yet in these provinces Christianity had long subsisted and Christians were now in such numbers as to lead the Roman governor to report to the emperor that they were found not only  in cities but in villages and in open countries of all ages of every rank and condition that they abounded so much as to have produced a visible desertion of the temples that beasts brought to market for victims had few purchasers that the sacred solemnities were much neglected circumstances noted by Pliny for the express purpose of shewing to the emperor the effect and prevalency of the new institution  No evidence remains by which it can be proved that the Christians were more numerous in Pontus and Bithynia than in other parts of the Roman empire nor has any reason been offered to shew why they should be so Christianity did not begin in these countries nor near them I do not know therefore that we ought to confine the description in Pliny's letter to the state of Christianity in those provinces even if no other account of the same subject had come down to us but certainly this letter may fairly be applied in aid and confirmation of the representations given of the general state  of Christianity in the world by Christian writers of that and the next succeeding age  Justin Martyr who wrote about thirty years after Pliny and one hundred and six after the ascension has these remarkable words "There is not a nation either of Greek or Barbarian or of any other name even of those who wander in tribes and live in tents amongst whom prayers and thanksgivings are not offered to the Father and Creator of the universe by the name of the crucified Jesus  Dial cum Tryph  " Tertullian who comes about fifty years after Justin appeals to the governors of the Roman empire in these terms "We were but of yesterday and we have filled your cities islands towns and boroughs the camp the senate and the forum They the heathen adversaries of Christianity lament that every sex age and condition and persons of every rank also are converts to that name  Tertull Apol c  " I do allow that these expressions are loose and  may be called declamatory But even declamation hath its bounds this public boasting upon a subject which must be known to every reader was not only useless but unnatural unless the truth of the case in a considerable degree corresponded with the description at least unless it had been both true and notorious that great multitudes of Christians of all ranks and orders were to be found in most parts of the Roman empire The same Tertullian in another passage by way of setting forth the extensive diffusion of Christianity enumerates as belonging to Christ beside many other countries the "Moors and Gaetulians of Africa the borders of Spain several nations of France and parts of Britain inaccessible to the Romans the Sarmatians Daci Germans and Scythians  Ad Jud c  " and which is more material than the extent of the institution the  number  of Christians in the several countries in which it prevailed is thus expressed by him "Although so great a multitude that in  almost every city we form the greater part we pass our time modestly and in silence  Ad Scap c  " Clement Alexandrinus who preceded Tertullian by a few years introduces a comparison between the success of Christianity and that of the most celebrated philosophical institutions "The philosophers were confined to Greece and to their particular retainers but the doctrine of the Master of Christianity did not remain in Judea as philosophy did in Greece but is spread throughout the whole world in every nation and village and city both of Greeks and Barbarians converting both whole houses and separate individuals having already brought over to the truth not a few of the philosophers themselves If the Greek philosophy be prohibited it immediately vanishes whereas from the first preaching of  our  doctrine kings and tyrants governors and presidents with their whole train and with the populace on their side have endeavoured with their whole might to exterminate it  yet doth it flourish more and more  Clem Al Strom lib vi ad fin  " Origen who follows Tertullian at the distance of only thirty years delivers nearly the same account "In every part of the world says he throughout all Greece and in all other nations there are innumerable and immense multitudes who having left the laws of their country and those whom they esteemed gods have given themselves up to the law of Moses and the religion of Christ and this not without the bitterest resentment from the idolaters by whom they were frequently put to torture and sometimes to death and it is wonderful to observe how in so short a time the religion has increased amidst punishment and death and every kind of torture  Or in Cels lib i  " In another passage Origen draws the following candid comparison between the state of Christianity in his time and the condition of its more primitive ages"By the good providence of God the Christian religion has so flourished and increased continually that it is now preached  freely without molestation although there were a thousand obstacles to the spreading of the doctrine of Jesus in the world But as it was the will of God that the Gentiles should have the benefit of it all the councils of men against the Christians were defeated and by how much the more emperors and governors of provinces and the people every where strove to depress them so much the more have they increased and prevailed exceedingly  Or con Cels lib vii  "  It is well known that within less than eighty years after this the Roman empire became Christian under Constantine and it is probable that Constantine declared himself on the side of the Christians because they were the powerful party for Arnobius who wrote immediately before Constantine's accession speaks of the whole world as filled with Christ's doctrine of its diffusion throughout all countries of an innumerable body of Christians in distant provinces of  the strange revolution of opinion of men of the greatest genius orators grammarians rhetoricians lawyers physicians having come over to the institution and that also in the face of threats executions and tortures  Arnob in Gentes l i p ed Lug Bat  " And not more than twenty years after Constantine's entire possession of the empire Julius Firmicus Maternus calls upon the emperors Constantius and Constans to extirpate the relics of the ancient religion the reduced and fallen condition of which is described by our author in the following words"Licet adhuc in quibusdam regionibus idololatriae morientia palpitent membra tamen in eo res est ut a Christianis omnibus terris pestiferum hoc malum funditùs amputetur" and in another place "modicum tantum superest ut legibus vestrisextincta idololatriae pereat funesta contagio  De Error Profan Relig c xxi p quoted by Lardner vol viii p  " It will not be thought that we quote this  writer in order to recommend his temper or his judgement but to shew the comparative state of Christianity and of Heathenism at this period Fifty years afterwards Jerome represents the decline of Paganism in language which conveys the same idea of its approaching extinction "Solitudinem patitur et in urbe gentilitas Dii quondam nationum cum bubonibus et noctuis in solis culminibus remanserunt  Jer ad Lect cp  " Jerome here indulges a triumph natural and allowable in a zealous friend of the cause but which could only be suggested to his mind by the consent and universality with which he saw the religion received "But now says he the passion and resurrection of Christ are celebrated in the discourses and writings of all nations I need not mention Jews Greeks and Latins The Indians Persians Goths and Egyptians philosophise and sirmly believe the immortality of the soul and future recompences which before the greatest philosophers had denied or doubted  of or perplexed with their disputes The fierceness of Thracians and Scythians is now softened by the gentle sound of the gospel and every where Christ is all in all  Jer ep ad Heliod  " Were therefore the motives of Constantine's conversion ever so problematical the easy establishment of Christianity and the ruin of Heathenism under him and his immediate successors is of itself a proof of the progress which Christianity had made in the preceding period It may be added also "that Maxentius the rival of Constantine had shewn himself friendly to the Christians Therefore of those who were contending for worldly power and empire one actually favoured and flattered them and another may be suspected to have joined himself to them partly from consideration of interest so considerable were they become under external disadvantages of all sorts  Lardner vol vii p  " This at least is certain that throughout the whole transaction hitherto the great  seemed to follow not to lead the public opinion  It may help to convey to us some notion of the extent and progress of Christianity or rather of the character and quality of many early Christians of their learning and their labours to notice the number of Christian  writers  who flourished in these ages St Jerome's catalogue contains  sixtysix  writers within the three first centuries and the six first years of the fourth and  fiftyfour  between that time and his own viz A D Jerome introduces his catalogue with the following just remonstrance"Let those who say the church has had no philosophers nor eloquent and learned men observe who and what they were who founded established and adorned it let them cease to accuse our faith of rusticity and confess their mistake  Jer Prol in lib de ser ecc  " Of these writers several as Justin Irenaeus Clement of Alexandria Tertullian Origen Bardesanes  Hippolitus Eusebius were voluminous writers Christian writers abounded particularly about the year Alexander bishop of Jerusalem founded a library in that city A D Pamphilus the friend of Origen founded a library at Cesarea A D Public defences were also set forth by various advocates of the religion in the course of its three first centuries Within one hundred years after Christ's ascension Quadratus and Aristides whose works except some few fragments of the first are lost and about twenty years afterwards Justin Martyr whose works remain presented apologies for the Christian religion to the Roman emperors Quadratus and Aristides to Adrian Justin to Antoninus Pius and a second to Marcus Antoninus Melito bishop of Sardis and Apollinaris bishop of Hierapolis and Miltiades men of great reputation did the same to Marcus Antoninus twenty years afterwards  Euseb Hist lib iv c See also Lardner vol ii p  and ten years after this  Apollonius who suffered martyrdom under the emperor Commodus composed an apology for his faith which he read in the senate and which was afterwards published  Lard vol ii p  Fourteen years after the apology of Apollonius Tertullian addressed the work which now remains under that name to the governors of provinces in the Roman empire and about the same time Minucius Felix composed a defence of the Christian religion which is still extant and shortly after the conclusion of this century copious defences of Christianity were published by Arnobius and Lactantius  SECTION II Reflections upon the preceding Account  IN viewing the progress of Christianity our first attention is due to the number of converts at Jerusalem immediately after its founder's death because this success was a success at the  time  and upon the  spot  when and where the chief part of the history had been transacted  We are in the next place called upon to attend to the early establishment of numerous Christian societies in Judea and Galilee which countries had been the scene of Christ's miracles and ministry and where the memory of what had passed and the knowledge of what was alledged must have yet been fresh and certain  We are thirdly invited to recollect the  success of the apostles and of their companions at the several places to which they came both within and without Judea because it was the credit given to original witnesses appealing for the truth of their accounts to what themselves had seen and heard The effect also of their preaching strongly confirms the truth of what our history positively and circumstantially relates that they were able to exhibit to their hearers supernatural attestations of their mission  We are lastly to consider the  subsequent  growth and spread of the religion of which we receive successive intimations and satisfactory though general and occasional accounts until its full and final establishment  In all these several stages the history is without a parallel for it must be observed that we have not now been tracing the progress and describing the prevalency of an opinion founded upon philosophical or critical arguments upon mere deductions of  reason or the construction of ancient writings of which kind are the several theories which have at different times gained possession of the public mind in various departments of science and literature and of one or other of which kind are the tenets also which divide the various sects of Christianity but that we speak of a system the very basis and postulatum of which was a supernatural character ascribed to a particular person of a doctrine the truth whereof depended entirely upon the truth of a matter of fact then recent "To establish a new religion even amongst a few people or in one single nation is a thing in itself exceedingly difficult To reform some corruptions which may have spread in a religion or to make new regulations in it is not perhaps so hard when the main and principal parts of that religion are preserved entire and unshaken and yet this very often cannot be accomplished without an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances and may be attempted a thousand times without success But to introduce a new  faith a new way of thinking and acting and to persuade many nations to quit the religion in which their ancestors had lived and died which had been delivered down to them from time immemorial to make them forsake and despise the deities which they had been accustomed to reverence and worship this is a work of still greater difficulty  Jortin's Dis on the Christ Rel p ed iv  The resistance of education worldly policy and superstition is almost invincible"  If men in these days be Christians in consequence of their education in submission to authority or in compliance with fashion let us recollect that the very contrary of this at the beginning was the case The first race of Christians as well as millions who succeeded them became such in formal opposition to all these motives to the whole power and strength of this influence Every argument therefore and every instance which sets forth the prejudice  of education and the almost irresistible effects of that prejudice and no persons are more fond of expatiating upon this subject than deistical writers in fact confirms the evidence of Christianity  But in order to judge of the argument which is drawn from the early propagation of Christianity I know no fairer way of proceeding than to compare what we have seen of the subject with the success of Christian missions in modern ages In the EastIndia mission supported by the society for promoting Christian knowledge we hear sometimes of thirty sometimes of forty being baptized in the course of a year and these principally children Of converts properly so called that is of adults voluntarily embracing Christianity the number is extremely small "Notwithstanding the labour of missionaries for upwards of two hundred years and the establishments of different Christian nations who support them there are not twelve thousand Indian  Christians and those almost entirely outcasts  Sketches relating to the history learning and manners of the Hindoos p quoted by Dr Robertson Hist Dis concerning ancient India p  "  I lament as much as any man the little progress which Christianity has made in these countries and the inconsiderable effect that has followed the labours of its missionaries but I see in it a strong proof of the divine origin of the religion What had the apostles to assist them in propagating Christianity which the missionaries have not If piety and zeal had been sufficient I doubt not but that our missionaries possess these qualities in a high degree for nothing except piety and zeal could engage them in the undertaking If sanctity of life and manners was the allurement the conduct of these men is unblameable If the advantage of education and learning be looked to there is not one of the modern missionaries who is not in this respect superior to all the apostles and that not only absolutely but what  is of more importance  relatively  in comparison that is with those amongst whom they exercise their office If the intrinsic excellency of the religion the perfection of its morality the purity of its precepts the eloquence or tenderness or sublimity of various parts of its writings were the recommendations by which it made its way these remain the same If the character and circumstances under which the preachers were introduced to the countries in which they taught be accounted of importance this advantage is all on the side of the modern missionaries They come from a country and a people to which the Indian world look up with sentiments of deference The apostles came forth amongst the Gentiles under no other name than that of Jews which was precisely the character they despised and derided If it be disgraceful in India to become a Christian it could not be much less so to be enrolled amongst those "quos per flagitia invisos vulgus Christianos appellabat" If the religion which they had to encounter be considered the difference I  apprehend will not be great The theology of both was nearly the same "what is supposed to be performed by the power of Jupiter of Neptune of Aeolus of Mars of Venus according to the mythology of the west is ascribed in the east to the agency of Agrio the god of fire Varoon the god of oceans Vayoo the god of wind Cama the god of love  Baghvat Geeta p quoted by Dr Robertson Ind Dis p  " The facred rites of the western polytheism were gay festive and licentious the rites of the public religion in the east partake of the same character with a more avowed indecency "In every function performed in the pagodas as well as in every public procession it is the office of these women  i e  of women prepared by the Brahmins for the purpose to dance before the idol and to sing hymns in his praise and it is difficult to say whether they trespass most against decency by the gestures they exhibit or by the verses which they recite The walls of the pagodas  were covered with paintings in a style no less indelicate  Others of the deities of the East are of an austere and gloomy character to be propitiated by victims sometimes by human sacrifices and by voluntary torments of the most excruciating kind  Voyage de Gentil vol i p Preface to Code of Gentoo Laws p quoted by Dr Robertson p  "  On both sides of the comparison the popular religion had a strong establishment In ancient Greece and Rome it was strictly incorporated with the state The magistrate was the priest The highest offices of government bore the most distinguished part in the celebration of the public rites In India a powerful and numerous cast possess exclusively the administration of the established worship and are of consequence devoted to its service and attached to its interest In both the prevailing mythology was destitute of any proper evidence or rather in both the origin of the tradition is run up into ages long anterior to the existence  of credible history or of written language The Indian chronology computes aeras by millions of years and the life of man by thousands  "The Suffec Jogue or age of purity is said to have lasted three million two hundred thousand years and they hold that the life of man was extended in that age to one hundred thousand years but there is a difference amongst the Indian writers of six millions of years in the computation of this aera" Ib  and in these or prior to these is placed the history of their divinities In both the established superstition held the same place in the public opinion that is to say in both it was credited by the bulk of the people  "How absurd soever the articles of faith may be which superstition has adopted or how unhallowed the rites which it prescribes the former are received in every age and country with unhesitating assent by the great body of the people and the latter observed with scrupulous exactness In our reasonings concerning opinions and practices which differ widely from our own we are extremely apt to err Having been instructed ourselves in the principles of a religion worthy in every respect of that divine wisdom by which they were dictated we frequently express wonder at the credulity of nations in embracing systems of belief which appear to us so directly repugnant to right reason and sometimes suspect that tenets so wild and extravagant do not really gain credit with them But experience may satisfy us that neither our wonder nor suspicions are well founded No article of the public religion was called in question by those people of ancient Europe with whose history we are best acquainted and no practice which it enjoined appeared improper to them On the other hand every opinion that tended to diminish the reverence of men for the gods of their country or to alienate them from their worship excited among the Greeks and Romans that indignant zeal which is natural to every people attached to their religion by a firm persuasion of its truth" Ind Dis p  but by the learned and  philosophic part of the community either derided or regarded by them as only fit to be upholden for the sake of its political uses  That the learned Brahmins of the East are rational theists and secretly reject the established theory and contemn the rites that were founded upon them or rather consider them as contrivances to be supported for their political uses see Dr Robertson's Ind Dis p    Or if it should be allowed that the ancient heathens believed in their religion less  generally than the present Indians do I am far from thinking that this circumstance would afford any facility to the work of the apostles above that of the modern missionaries To me it appears and I think it material to be remarked that a disbelief of the established religion of their country has no tendency to dispose men for the reception of another but that on the contrary it generates a settled contempt of all religious pretensions whatever General insidelity is the hardest soil which the propagators of a new religion can have to work upon Could a Methodist or Moravian promise himself a better chance of success with a French esprit fort who had been accustomed to laugh at the Popery of his country than with a believing Mahometan or Hindoo Or are our modern unbelievers in Christianity for that reason in danger of becoming Mahometans or Hindoos It does not appear that the Jews who had a body of historical evidence to offer for their religion and who at that time undoubtedly entertained and held forth the expectation of a future state  derived any great advantage as to the extension of their system from the discredit into which the popular religion had fallen with many of their heathen neighbours  We have particularly directed our observations to the state and progress of Christianity amongst the inhabitants of  India  but the history of the Christian mission in other countries where the efficacy of the mission is left solely to the conviction wrought by the preaching of strangers presents the same idea as the Indian mission does of the feebleness and inadequacy of human means About twentyfive years ago was published in England a translation from the Dutch of a history of Greenland and a relation of the mission for above thirty years carried on in that country by the Unitas Fratrum or Moravians Every part of that relation confirms the opinion we have stated Nothing could surpass or hardly equal the zeal and patience of the missionaries Yet their historian in the conclusion of his narrative could find place for no reflections  more encouraging than the following"A person that had known the heathen that had seen the little benefit from the great pains hitherto taken with them and considered that one after another had abandoned all hopes of the conversion of those infidels and some thought they would never be converted till they saw miracles wrought as in the apostles' days and this the Greenlanders expected and demanded of their instructors one that considered this I say would not much wonder at the past unfruitfulness of these young beginners as at their steadfast perseverance in the midst of nothing but distress difficulties and impediments internally and externally and that they never desponded of the conversion of those poor creatures amidst all seeming impossibilities  Hist of Greenland vol ii p  "  From the widely disproportionate effects which attend the preaching of modern missionaries of Christianity compared with what followed the ministry of Christ and  his apostles under circumstances either alike or not so unlike as to account for the difference a conclusion is fairly drawn in support of what our histories deliver concerning them viz that they possessed means of conviction which we have not that they had proofs to appeal to which we want  SECTION III Of the Roligion of Mahomet  THE only event in the history of the human species which admits of comparison with the propagation of Christianity is the success of Mahometanism The Mahometan institution was rapid in its progress was recent in its history and was founded upon a supernatural or prophetic character assumed by its author In these articles the resemblance with Christianity is confessed But there are points of difference which separate we apprehend the two cases entirely  I Mahomet did not found his pretensions upon miracles properly so called that is upon proofs of supernatural agency capable of being known and attested by others Christians are warranted in this assertion by the evidence of the Koran in which Mahomet  not only does not affect the power of working miracles but expressly disclaims it The following passages of that book furnish direct proofs of the truth of what we alledge"The infidels say unless a sign be sent down unto him from his lord we will not believe thou art a preacher only  Sale's Koran c xiii p ed quarto  " Again "Nothing hindered us from sending  thee  with miracles except that the former nations have charged them with imposture  c xvii p  " And lastly "They say unless a sign be sent down unto him from his lord we will not believe answer signs are in the power of God alone and I am no more than a public preacher Is it not sufficient for them that we have sent down unto them the book of the Koran to be read unto them  c xxix p  " Beside these acknowledgments I have observed  thirteen  distinct places in which Mahomet puts the objection unless a sign c into the mouth of the unbeliever in not one of which does he alledge  a miracle in reply His answer is "that God giveth the power of working miracles when and to whom he pleaseth  Sale's Koran c v x xiii twice  " "that if he should work miracles they would not believe  c vi  " "that they had before rejected Moses and Jesus and the Prophets who wrought miracles  c iii xxi xxviii  " "that the Koran itself was a miracle  c xvi  "  The only place in the Koran in which it can be pretended that a sensible miracle is referred to for I do not allow the secret visitations of Gabriel the night journey of Mahomet to heaven or the presence in battle of invisible hosts of angels to deserve the name of  sensible  miracles is the beginning of the fiftyfourth chapter The words are these"The hour of judgement approacheth  and the moon hath been split in sunder  but if the unbelievers see a sign they turn aside saying this is a powerful charm" The Mahometan expositors disagree in their interpretation of this passage some explaining  it to be a mention of the splitting of the moon as one of the future signs of the approach of the day of judgement others referring it to a miraculous appearance which had then taken place  Vide Sale in loc  It seems to me not improbable that Mahomet may have taken advantage of some extraordinary halo or other unusual appearance of the moon which had happened about this time and which supplied a foundation both for this passage and for the story which in after times had been raised out of it  After this more than silence after these authentic  confessions  of the Koran we are not to be moved with miraculous stories related of Mahomet by Abulfeda who wrote his life about six hundred years after his death or which are found in the legend of Al Jannabi who came two hundred years later  It does not I think appear that these historians had any written accounts to appeal to more ancient than the Sonnah which was a collection of traditions made by order of the Caliphs two hundred years after Mahomet's death Mahomet died A D Al Bochari one of the six doctors who compiled the Sonnah was born A D died Prideaux's Life of Mahomet p ed th    On the contrary from comparing what Mahomet himself wrote and said with what was afterwards reported of him by his followers the plain and fair conclusion is that when the religion was established by conquest then and not till then came out the stories of his miracles  Now this difference alone constitutes in my opinion a bar to all reasoning from one case to the other The success of a religion founded upon a miraculous history shews the credit which was given to the history and this credit under the circumstances in which it was given  i e  by persons capable of knowing the truth and interested to enquire after it is evidence of the reality of the history and by consequence of the truth of the religion Where a miraculous history is not alledged no part of this argument  can be implied We admit that multitudes acknowledged the pretensions of Mahomet but these pretensions being destitute of miraculous evidence we know that the grounds upon which they were acknowledged could not be secure grounds of persuasion to his followers nor their example any authority to us Admit the whole of Mahomet's authentic history so far as it was of a nature capable of being known or witnessed by others to be true which is certainly to admit all that the reception of the religion can be brought to prove and Mahomet might still be an impostor or enthusiast or an union of both Admit to be true almost any part of Christ's history of that I mean which was public and within the cognisance of his followers and he must have come from God Where matter of fact is not in question where miracles are not alledged I do not see that the progress of a religion is a better argument of its truth than the prevalency of any system of opinions in natural religion morality or physics is a proof of the truth of those opinions  And we know that this sort of argument is inadmissible in any branch of philosophy whatever  But it will be said if one religion could make its way without miracles why might not another To which I reply first that this is not the question the proper question is not whether a religious institution could be set up without miracles but whether a religion or a change of religion founding itself in miracles could succeed without any reality to rest upon I apprehend these two cases to be very different and I apprehend Mahomet's not taking this course to be one proof amongst others that the thing is difficult if not impossible to be accomplished certainly it was not from an unconsciousness of the value and importance of miraculous evidence for it is very observable that in the same volume and sometimes in the same chapters in which Mahomet so repeatedly disclaims the power of working miracles himself he is incessantly referring to the miracles of preceding prophets One  would imagine to hear some men talk or to read some books that the setting up of a religion by dint of miraculous pretences was a thing of every day's experience whereas I believe that except the Jewish and Christian religion there is no tolerably well authenticated account of any such thing having been accomplished  II Secondly the establishment of Mahomet's religion was effected by causes which in no degree appertained to the origin of Christianity  During the first twelve years of his mission Mahomet had recourse only to persuasion This is allowed And there is sufficient reason from the effect to believe that if he had confined himself to this mode of propagating his religion we of the present day should never have heard either of him or it "Three years were silently employed in the conversion of  fourteen  proselytes For ten years the religion advanced with a slow and painful progress within the walls  of Mecca The number of proselytes in the seventh year of his mission may be estimated by the absence of  eightythree  men and eighteen women who retired to Aethiopia  Gibbon's Hist vol ix p et seq ed Dub  " Yet this progress such as it was appears to have been aided by some very important advantages which Mahomet found in his situation in his mode of conducting his design and in his doctrine  I Mahomet was the grandson of the most powerful and honourable family in Mecca and although the early death of his father had not left him a patrimony suitable to his birth he had long before the commencement of his mission repaired this deficiency by an opulent marriage A person considerable by his wealth of high descent and nearly allied to the chiefs of his country taking upon himself the character of a religious teacher would not fail of attracting attention and followers  Mahomet conducted his design in the outset especially with great art and prudence He conducted it as a politician would conduct a plot His first application was to his own family This gained him his wife's uncle a considerable person in Mecca together with his cousin Ali afterwards the celebrated Caliph then a youth of great expectation and even already distinguished by his attachment impetuosity and courage  Of which Mr Gibbon has preserved the following specimen"When Mahomet called out in an assembly of his family who among you will be my companion and my vizir Ali then only in the fourteenth year of his age suddenly replied O prophet I am the man whosoever rises against thee I will dash out his teeth tear out his eyes break his legs rip up his belly O prophet I will be thy vizir over them" Vol ix p  He next addressed himself to Abu Becr a man amongst the first of the Koreish in wealth and influence The interest and example of Abu Becr drew in five other principal persons in Mecca whose solicitations prevailed upon five more of the  same rank This was the work of three years during which time every thing was transacted in secret Upon the strength of these allies and under the powerful protection of his family who however some of them might disapprove his enterprise or deride his pretensions would not suffer the orphan of their house the relict of their favourite brother to be insulted Mahomet now commenced his public preaching And the advance which he made during the nine or ten remaining years of his peaceable ministry was by no means greater than what with these advantages and with the additional and singular circumstance of there being no  established  religion at Mecca at that time to contend with might reasonably have been expected How soon his primitive adherents were let into the secret of his views of empire or in what stage of his undertaking these views first opened themselves to his own mind it is not now easy to determine The event however was that these his first proselytes all ultimately attained to  riches and honours to the command of armies and the government of kingdoms  Gib vol ix p    The Arabs deduced their descent from Abraham through the line of Ishmael The inhabitants of Mecca in common probably with the other Arabian tribes acknowledged as I think may clearly be collected from the Koran one supreme deity but had associated with him many objects of idolatrous worship The great doctrine with which Mahomet set out was the strict and exclusive unity of God Abraham he told them their illustrious ancestor Ishmael the father of their nation Moses the lawgiver of the Jews and Jesus the author of Christianity had all asserted the same thing that their followers had universally corrupted the truth and that  he  was now commissioned to restore it to the world Was it to be wondered at that a doctrine so specious and authorised by names some or other of which were holden in the highest  veneration by every description of his hearers should in the hands of a popular missionary prevail to the extent in which Mahomet succeeded by his pacific ministry  Of the institution which Mahomet joined with this fundamental doctrine and of the Koran in which that institution is delivered we discover I think two purposes that pervade the whole viz to make converts and to make his converts soldiers The following particulars amongst others may be considered as pretty evident indications of these designs  When Mahomet began to preach his address to the Jews the Christians and to the Pagan Arabs was that the religion which he taught was no other than what had been originally their own "We believe in God and that which hath been sent down unto us and that which hath been sent down unto Abraham and Ismael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes and that which was delivered unto Moses and Jesus  and that which was delivered unto the Prophets from their Lord we make no distinction between any of them  Sale's Koran c ii p  " "He hath ordained you the religion which he commanded Noah and which we have revealed unto thee O Mohammed and which we commanded Abraham and Moses and Jesus saying observe this religion and be not divided therein  Ib c xlii p  " "He hath chosen you and hath not imposed on you any difficulty in the religion which he hath given you the religion of your father Abraham  Ib c xxii p  "  The author of the Koran never ceases from describing the future anguish of unbelievers their despair regret penitence and torment It is the point which he labours above all others And these descriptions are conceived in terms which will appear in no small degree impressive even to the modern reader of an English translation  Doubtless they would operate with much greater force upon the minds of those to whom they were immediately directed The terror which they seem well calculated to inspire would be to many tempers a powerful application  On the other hand his voluptuous paradise his robes of silk his palaces of marble his rivers and shades his groves and couches his wines his dainties and above all his seventytwo virgins assigned to each of the faithful of resplendent beauty and eternal youth intoxicated the imaginations and seized the passions of his Eastern followers  But Mahomet's highest heaven was reserved for those who fought his battles or expended their fortunes in his cause "Those believers who sit still at home not having any hurt and those who employ their fortunes and their persons for the religion of God shall not be held equal God hath preferred those who employ their fortunes  and their persons in that cause to a degree above those who sit at home God hath indeed promised every one Paradise but God hath preferred those who  fight for the faith  before those who sit still by adding unto them a great reward by degrees of honour conferred upon them from him and by granting them forgiveness and mercy  Ib c iv p  " Again "Do ye reckon the giving drink to the pilgrims and the visiting of the holy temple to be actions as meritorious as those performed by him who believeth in God and the last day and  fighteth for the religion of God  they shall not be held equal with GodThey who have believed and fled their country and employed their substance and their persons in the defence of God's true religion shall be in the highest degree of honour with God and these are they who shall be happy The Lord sendeth them good tidings of mercy from him and good will and of gardens wherein they shall enjoy lasting pleasures They shall  continue therein for ever for with God is a great reward  Ib c ix p  " And once more "Verily God hath purchased of the true believers their souls and their substance promising them the enjoyment of Paradise on condition that they  fight for the cause of God  whether they slay or be slain the promise for the same is assuredly due by the law and the gospel and the Koran  Ib p  "The sword saith Mahomet is the key of heaven and of hell a drop of blood shed in the cause of God a night spent in arms is of more avail than two months of fasting or prayer Whosoever falls in battle his sins are forgiven at the day of judgement his wounds shall be resplendent as vermilion and odoriferous as musk and the loss of his limbs shall be supplied by the wings of angels and cherubim" Gibb vol ix p  "  His doctrine of predestination was applicable and was applied by him to the same purpose of fortifying and of exalting the courage of his adherents "If any thing of the matter had happened unto us  we had not been slain here Answer if ye had been in your houses verily they would have gone forth to fight whose slaughter was decreed to the places where they died  C iii p  "  In warm regions the appetite of the sexes is ardent the passion for inebriating liquors moderate In compliance with this distinction although Mahomet laid a restraint upon the drinking of wine in the use of women he allowed an almost unbounded indulgence Four wives with the liberty of changing them at pleasure  C iv p  together with the persons of all his captives  Gibb p  was an irresistible bribe to an Arabian warrior "God is minded" says he speaking of this very subject "to make his religion light unto you for man was created weak" How different this from the unaccommodating purity of the Gospel How would Mahomet have succeeded with the Christian  lesson in his mouth "Whosoever looketh after a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" It must be added that Mahomet did not venture upon the prohibition of wine till the fourth year of the Hegira or the seventeenth of his mission  Mod Un Hist vol i p  when his military successes had completely established his authority The same observation holds of the fast of the Ramadan  Ib p  and of the most laborious part of his institution the pilgrimage to Mecca  This latter however already prevailed amongst the Arabs and had grown out of their excessive veneration for the Caaba Mahomet's law in this respect was rather a compliance than an innovation  Sale's Prolim p      What has hitherto been collected from the records of the Mussulman history relates to the twelve or thirteen years of Mahomet's peaceable preaching which part alone of his life and enterprise admits of the smallest comparison with the origin of  Christianity A new scene is now unfolded The city of Medina distant about ten days journey from Mecca was at that time distracted by the hereditary contentions of two hostile tribes These feuds were exasperated by the mutual persecutions of the Jews and Christians and of the different Christian sects by which the city was inhabited  Mod Un Hist vol i p  The religion of Mahomet presented in some measure a point of union or compromise to these divided opinions It embraced the principles which were common to them all Each party saw in it an honourable acknowledgement of the fundamental truth of their own system To the Pagan Arab somewhat imbued with the sentiments and knowledge of his Jewish or Christian fellow citizen it offered no offensive or very improbable theology This recommendation procured to Mahometanism a more favourable reception at Medina than its author had been able by twelve years painful endeavours to obtain for it at Mecca Yet  after all the progress of the religion was inconsiderable His missionary could only collect a congregation of forty persons  Ib p  It was not a religious but a political association which ultimately introduced Mahomet into Medina Harassed as it should seem and disgusted by the long continuance of factions and disputes the inhabitants of that city saw in the admission of the Prophet's authority a rest from the miseries which they had suffered and a suppression of the violence and fury which they had learnt to condemn After an embassy therefore composed of believers and unbelievers  Ib p  and of persons of both tribes with whom a treaty was concluded of strict alliance and support Mahomet made his public entry and was received as the Sovereign of Medina  From this time or soon after this time the impostor changed his language and his conduct Having now a town at his command  where to arm his party and to head them with security he enters upon new councils He now pretends that a divine commission is given to him to attack the insidels to destroy idolatry and to set up the true faith by the sword  Ib p  An early victory over a very superior force achieved by conduct and bravery established the renown of his arms and of his personal character  Victory of Bedr ib p  Every year after this was marked by battles or assassinations The nature and activity of Mahomet's future exertions may be estimated from the computation that in the nine following years of his life he commanded his army in person in eight general engagements  Un Hist vol i p  and undertook by himself or his lieutenants fifty military enterprises  From this time we have nothing left to account for but that Mahomet should collect an army that his army should conquer and that his religion should proceed together  with his conquests The ordinary experience of human affairs leaves us little to wonder at in any of these effects and they were likewise each assisted by peculiar facilities From all sides the roving Arabs crowded around the standard of religion and plunder of freedom and victory of arms and rapine Beside the highly painted joys of a carnal paradise Mahomet rewarded his followers in this world with a liberal division of the spoils and with the persons of their female captives  Gibb vol ix p  The condition of Arabia occupied by small independent tribes exposed it to the impression and yielded to the progress of a firm and resolute army After the reduction of his native peninsula the weakness also of the Roman provinces on the North and the West as well as the distracted state of the Persian empire on the East facilitated the successful invasion of neighbouring countries That Mahomet's conquests should carry his religion along with them will excite little surprise  when we know the conditions which he proposed to the vanquished Death or conversion was the only choice offered to idolaters "Strike off their heads strike off all the ends of their fingers  Sale's Coran c viii p  kill the idolaters wheresoever ye shall find them  Ib c ix p  " To the Jews and Christians was left the somewhat milder alternative of subjection and tribute if they persisted in their own religion or of an equal participation in the rights and liberties the honours and privileges of the faithful if they embraced the religion of their conquerors "Ye Christian dogs you know your option the Koran the tribute or the sword  Gibb ib p  " The corrupt state of Christianity in the seventh century and the contentions of its sects unhappily so fell in with mens care of their safety or their fortunes as to induce many to forsake its profession Add to all which that Mahomet's victories not only operated by the natural effect of conquest but that they  were constantly represented both to his friends and enemies as divine declarations in his favour Success was evidence Prosperity carried with it not only influence but proof "Ye have already" says he after the battle of Bedr "had a miracle shown you in two armies which attacked each other one army fought for God's true religion but the other were insidels  Sale's Kor c iii p  " Again  "Ye  slew not those who were slain at Bedr but God slew themIf ye desire a decision of the matter between us now hath a decision come unto you  Ch viii p  "  Many more passages might be collected out of the Koran to the same effect But they are unnecessary The success of Mahometanism during this and indeed every future period of its history bears so little resemblance to the early propagation of Christianity that no inference whatever can justly be drawn from it to the prejudice of the Christian argument For what are we  comparing A Galilean peasant accompanied by a few fishermen with a conqueror at the head of his army We compare Jesus without force without power without support without one external circumstance of attraction or influence prevailing against the prejudices the learning the hierarchy of his country against the ancient religious opinions the pompous religious rites the philosophy the wisdom the authority of the Roman empire in the most polished and enlightened period of its existence with Mahomet making his way amongst Arabs collecting followers in the midst of conquests and triumphs in the darkest ages and countries of the world and when success in arms not only operated by that command of men's wills and persons which attends prosperous undertakings but was considered as a sure testimony of divine approbation That multitudes persuaded by this argument should join the train of a victorious chief that still greater multitudes should without any argument bow down before irresistible power is a conduct in  which we cannot see much to surprise us in which we can see nothing that resembles the causes by which the establishment of Christianity was effected  The success therefore of Mahometanism stands not in the way of this important conclusion that the propagation of Christianity in the manner and under the circumstances in which it was propagated is an  unique  in the history of the species A Jewish peasant overthrew the religion of the world  I have nevertheless placed the prevalency of the religion amongst the auxiliary arguments of its truth because whether it had prevailed or not or whether its prevalency can or cannot be accounted for the direct argument remains still It is still true that a great number of men upon the spot personally connected with the history and with the author of the religion were induced by what they heard and saw and knew not only to change their former opinions but to give up their time and sacrifice  their case to traverse seas and kingdoms without rest and without weariness to commit themselves to extreme dangers to undertake incessant toils to undergo grievous sufferings and all this solely in consequence and in support of their belief of facts which if true establish the truth of the religion which if false they must have known to be so  PART III A BRIEF CONSIDERATION OF SOME POPULAR OBJECTIONS  CHAP I The Discrepancies between the several Gospels  I KNOW not a more rash or unphilosophical conduct of the understanding than to reject the substance of a story by reason of some diversity in the circumstances with which it is related The usual character of human testimony is substantial truth under circumstantial variety This is what the daily experience of courts of justice teaches When accounts of a transaction come from the mouths of different witnesses it is seldom  that it is not possible to pick out apparent or real inconsistencies between them These inconsistencies are studiously displayed by an adverse pleader but oftentimes with little impression upon the minds of the judges On the contrary a close and minute agreement induces the suspicion of confederacy and fraud When written histories touch upon the same scenes of action the comparison almost always affords ground for a like reflection Numerous and sometimes important variations present themselves not seldom also absolute and final contradictions yet neither one nor the other are deemed sufficient to shake the credibility of the main fact The embassy of the Jews to deprecate the execution of Claudian's order to place his statue in their temple Philo places in harvest Josephus in seedtime both contemporary writers No reader is led by this inconsistency to doubt whether such an embassy was sent or whether such an order was given Our own history supplies examples of the same kind In the account of the Marquis of Argyle's death in the reign  of Charles the Second we have a very remarkable contradiction Lord Clarendon relates that he was condemned to be hanged which was performed the same day on the contrary Burnet Woodrow Heath Echard concur in stating that he was beheaded and that he was condemned upon the Saturday and executed upon the Monday  See Biog Britan  Was any reader of English history ever sceptic enough to raise from hence a question whether the Marquis of Argyle was executed or not Yet this ought to be left in uncertainty according to the principles upon which the Christian history has sometimes been attacked Dr Middleton contended that the different hours of the day assigned to the crucifixion of Christ by John and by the other evangelists did not admit of the reconcilement which learned men had proposed and then concludes the discussion with this hard remark "We must be forced▪ with several of the critics to leave the difficulty just as  we found it chargeable with all the consequences of manifest inconsistency  Middleton's Reflections answered by Benson Hist Chris vol iii p  " But what are these consequences by no means the discrediting of the history as to the principal fact by a repugnancy even supposing that repugnancy not to be resolvable into different modes of computation in the time of the day in which it is said to have taken place  A great deal of the discrepancy observable in the Gospels arises from  omission  from a fact or a passage of Christ's life being noticed by one writer which is unnoticed by another Now omission is at all times a very uncertain ground of objection We perceive it not only in the comparison of different writers but even in the same writer when compared with himself There are a great many particulars and some of them of importance mentioned by Josephus in his Antiquities which as we should have supposed  ought to have been put down by him in their place in the Jewish Wars  Lard part i vol ii p et seq  Suetonius Tacitus Dio Cassius have all three written of the reign of Tiberius Each has mentioned many things omitted by the rest  Ib p  yet no objection is from thence taken to the respective credit of their histories We have in our own times if there were not something indecorous in the comparison the life of an eminent person written by three of his friends in which there is very great variety in the incidents selected by them some apparent and perhaps some real contradictions yet without any impeachment of the substantial truth of their accounts of the authenticity of the books of the competent information or general fidelity of the writers  But these discrepancies will be still more numerous when men do not write histories but  memoirs  which is perhaps the true name and proper description of our Gospels that is when they do not undertake or ever  meant to deliver in order of time a regular and complete account of  all  the things of importance which the person who is the subject of their history did or said but only out of many similar ones to give such passages or such actions and discourses as offered themselves more immediately to their attention came in the way of their enquiries occurred to their recollection or were suggested by their  particular design  at the time of writing  This particular design may appear sometimes but not always nor often Thus I think that the particular design which St Matthew had in view whilst he was writing the history of the resurrection was to attest the faithful performance of Christ's promise to his disciples to go before them into Galilee because he alone except Mark who seems to have taken it from him has recorded this promise and he alone has confined his narrative to that single appearance to the disciples which fulfilled it It was the preconcerted the great and most public manifestation  of our Lord's person It was the thing which dwelt upon St Matthew's mind and he adapted his narrative to it But that there is nothing in St Matthew's language which negatives other appearances or which imports that this his appearance to his disciples in Galilee in pursuance of his promise was his first or only appearance is made pretty evident by St Mark's Gospel which uses the same terms concerning the appearance in Galilee as St Matthew uses yet itself records two other appearances prior to this "Go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee then shall ye see him as he said unto you" xvi We might be apt to infer from these words that this was the  first  time they were to see him at least we might infer it with as much reason as we draw the inference from the same words in Matthew yet the historian himself did not perceive that he was leading his readers to any such conclusion for in the twelfth and two following verses of this chapter he informs us of two appearances which by comparing  the order of events are shewn to have been prior to the appearance in Galilee "He appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them afterwards he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen"  Probably the same observation concerning the  particular design  which guided the historian may be of use in comparing many other passages of the Gospels  CHAP II Erroneous Opinions imputed to the Apostles  A Species of candour which is shewn towards every other book is sometimes refused to the Scriptures and that is the placing of a distinction between judgment and testimony We do not usually question the credit of a writer by reason of any opinion he may have delivered upon subjects unconnected with his evidence and even upon subjects connected with his account or mixed with it in the same discourse or writing we naturally separate facts from opinions testimony from observation narrative from argument  To apply this equitable consideration to the Christian records much controversy and much objection has been raised concerning  the quotations of the Old Testament found in the New some of which quotations it is said are applied in a sense and to events apparently different from that which they bear and from those to which they belong in the original It is probable to my apprehension that many of those quotations were intended by the writers of the New Testament as nothing more than  accommodations  They quoted passages of their scripture which suited and fell in with the occasion before them without always undertaking to assert that the occasion was in the view of the author of the words Such accommodations of passages from old authors from books especially which are in every one's hands are common with writers of all countries but in none perhaps were more to be expected than in the writings of the Jews whose literature was almost entirely confined to their scriptures Those prophecies which are alledged with more solemnity and which are accompanied with a precise declaration that they originally respected the event then related are I think truly alledged But  were it otherwise is the judgment of the writers of the New Testament in interpreting passages of the Old or sometimes perhaps in receiving established interpretations so connected either with their veracity or with their means of information concerning what was passing in their own times as that a critical mistake even were it clearly made out should overthrow their historical creditDoes it diminish it Has it any thing to do with it  Another error imputed to the first Christians was the expected approach of the day of judgment I would introduce this objection by a remark upon what appears to me a somewhat similar example Our Saviour speaking to Peter of John said "If I will that he tarry till I come what is that to thee  John xxi  " These words we find had been so misconstrued as that "a report" from thence "went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die" Suppose that this  had come down to us amongst the prevailing opinions of the early Christians and that the particular circumstance from which the mistake sprung had been lost which humanly speaking was most likely to have been the case some at this day would have been ready to regard and quote the error as an impeachment of the whole Christian system Yet with how little justice such a conclusion would have been drawn or rather such a presumption taken up the information which we happen to possess enables us now to perceive To those who think that the Scriptures lead us to believe that the early Christians and even the Apostles expected the approach of the day of judgment in their own times the same reflection will occur as that which we have made with respect to the more partial perhaps and temporary but still no less ancient error concerning the duration of St John's life It was an error it may be likewise said which would effectually hinder those who entertained it from acting the part of impostors  The difficulty which attends the subject of the present chapter is contained in this question if we once admit the fallibility of the apostolic judgment where are we to stop or in what can we rely upon it To which question as arguing with unbelievers and as arguing for the substantial truth of the Christian history and for that alone it is competent to the advocate of Christianity to reply Give me the apostle's testimony and I do not stand in need of their judgment give me the facts and I have complete security for every conclusion I want  But although I think that it is competent to the Christian apologist to return this answer I do not think that it is the only answer which the objection is capable of receiving The two following cautions founded I apprehend in the most reasonable distinctions will exclude all uncertainty upon this head which can be attended with danger  First to separate what was the object of the apostolic mission and declared by them  to be so from what was extraneous to it or only incidentally connected with it Of points clearly extraneous to the religion nothing need be said Of points incidentally connected with it something may be added Demoniacal possession is one of these points concerning the reality of which as this place will not admit the examination or even the production of the arguments on either side of the question it would be arrogance in me to deliver any judgment And it is unnecessary For what I am concerned to observe is that even they who think that it was a general but erroneous opinion of those times and that the writers of the New Testament in common with other Jewish writers of that age fell into the manner of speaking and of thinking upon the subject which then universally prevailed need not be alarmed by the concession as though they had any thing to fear from it for the truth of Christianity The doctrine was not what Christ brought into the world It appears in the Christian records incidentally and accidentally as being the subsisting  opinion of the age and country in which his ministry was exercised It was no part of the object of  his  revelation to regulate mens opinions concerning the action of spiritual substances upon animal bodies At any rate it is unconnected with testimony If a dumb person was by a word restored to the use of his speech it signifies little to what cause the dumbness was ascribed and the like of every other cure wrought upon those who are said to have been possessed The malady was real the cure was real whether the popular explication of the cause was well founded or not The matter of fact the change so far as it was an object of sense or of testimony was in either case the same  Secondly that in reading the apostolic writings we distinguish between their doctrines and their arguments Their doctines came to them by revelation properly so called yet in propounding these doctrines in their writings or discourses they were wont to illustrate support and enforce them  by such analogies arguments and considerations as their own thoughts suggested Thus the call of the Gentiles that is the admission of the Gentiles to the Christian profession without a previous subjection to the law of Moses was imparted to the Apostles by revelation and was attested by the miracles which attended the Christian ministry amongst them The Apostles own assurance of the matter rested upon this foundation Nevertheless St Paul when treating of the subject offers a great variety of topics in its proof and vindication The doctrine itself must be received but is it necessary in order to defend Christianity to defend the propriety of every comparison or the validity of every argument which the apostle has brought into the discussion The same observation applies to some other instances and is in my opinion very well founded "When divine writers argue upon any point we are always bound to believe the conclusions that their reasonings end in as parts of divine revelation but we are not bound to be able to make out or  even to assent to all the premises made use of by them in their whole extent unless it appear plainly that they affirm the premises as expressly as they do the conclusions proved by them  Burnet's Expos art  "  CHAP III The Connection of Christianity with the Jewish History  UNDOUBTEDLY our Saviour assumes the divine origin of the Mosaic institution and independently of his authority I conceive it to be very difficult to assign any other cause for the commencement or existence of that institution especially for the singular circumstance of the Jews adhering to the unity when every other people slid into polytheism for their being men in religion children in every thing else behind other nations in the arts of peace and war superior to the most improved in their sentiments and doctrines relating to the deity  "In the doctrine for example of the unity the eternity the omnipotence the omniscience the omnipresence the wisdom and the goodness of God in their opinions concerning providence and the creation preservation and government of the world" Campbell on Mir p To which we may add in the acts of their religion not being accompanied either with cruelties or impurities in the religion itself being free from a species of superstition which prevailed universally in the popular religions of the ancient world and which is to be found perhaps in all religions that have their origin in human artifice and credulity viz fanciful connections between certain appearances and actions and the destiny of nations or individuals Upon these conceits rested the whole train of auguries and auspices which formed so much even of the serious part of the religions of Greece and Rome and of the charms and incantations which were practised in those countries by the common people From every thing of this sort the religion of the Jews and of the Jews alone was free Vid Priestley's Lectures on the Truth of the Jewish and Christian Revelation  Undoubtedly  also our Saviour recognises the prophetic character of many of their ancient writers So far therefore we are bound as Christians to go But to make Christianity answerable with its life for the circumstantial truth of each separate passage of the Old Testament the genuineness of every book the information fidelity and judgment of every writer in it is to bring I will not say  great but unnecessary difficulties into the whole system These books were universally read and received by the Jews of our Saviour's time He and his apostles in common with all other Jews referred to them alluded to them used them Yet except where he expressly ascribes a divine authority to particular predictions I do not know that we can strictly draw any conclusion from the books being so used and applied beside the proof which it unquestionably is of their notoriety and reception at that time In this view our scriptures afford a valuable testimony to those of the Jews But the nature of this testimony ought to be understood It is surely very different from what it is sometimes represented to be a specific ratification of each particular fact and opinion and not only of each particular fact but of the motives assigned for every action together with the judgment of praise or dispraise bestowed upon them St James in his epistle  v    says "Ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord" Notwithstanding this text the reality of Job's history and even the existence of such a person has been always deemed a fair subject of enquiry and discussion amongst Christian divines St James's authority is considered as good evidence of the existence of the book of Job at that time and of its reception by the Jews and of nothing more St Paul in his second epistle to Timothy  iii  has this similitude "Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth" These names are not found in the Old Testament And it is uncertain whether St Paul took them from some apocryphal writing then extant or from tradition But no one ever imagined that St Paul is here asserting the authority of the writing if it was a written account which he quoted or making himself answerable for the authenticity of the tradition much less that he so involves himself with either  of these questions as that the credit of his own history and mission should depend upon the fact whether "Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses or not" For what reason a more rigorous interpretation should be put upon other references it is difficult to know I do not mean that other passages of the Jewish history stand upon no better evidence than the history of Job or of Jannes and Jambres I think much otherwise but I mean that a reference in the New Testament to a passage in the Old does not so six its authority as to exclude all enquiry into its credibility or into the separate reasons upon which that credibility is founded and that it is an unwarrantable as well as unsafe rule to lay down concerning the Jewish history what was never laid down concerning any other that either every particular of it must be true or the whole false  I have thought it necessary to state this point explicitly because a fashion revived by Voltaire and pursued by the disciples of his  school seems to have much prevailed of late of attacking Christianity through the sides of Judaism Some objections of this class are founded in misconstruction some in exaggeration but all proceed upon a supposition which has not been made out by argument viz that the attestation which the author and first teachers of Christianity gave to the divine mission of Moses and the prophets extends to every point and portion of the Jewish history and so extends as to make Christianity responsible in its own credibility for the circumstantial truth I had almost said for the critical exactness of every narrative contained in the Old Testament  CHAP IV Rejection of Christianity  WE acknowledge that the Christian religion although it converted great numbers did not produce an universal or even a general conviction in the minds of men of the age and countries in which it appeared And this want of a more complete and extensive success is called the  rejection  of the Christian history and miracles and has been thought by some to form a strong objection to the reality of the facts which the history contains  The matter of the objection divides itself into two parts as it relates to the Jews and as it relates to Heathen nations because the minds of these two descriptions of men may have been with respect to Christianity under the influence of very different causes The case of the Jews inasmuch as  our Saviour's ministry was originally addressed to them offers itself first to our consideration  Now upon the subject of the truth of the Christian religion with  us  there is but one question viz whether the miracles were actually wrought From acknowledging the miracles we pass instantaneously to the acknowledgment of the whole No doubt lies between the premises and the conclusion If we believe the works or any one of them we believe in Jesus And this order of reasoning is become so universal and familiar that we do not readily apprehend how it could ever have been otherwise Yet it appears to me perfectly certain that the state of thought in the mind of a Jew of our Saviour's age was totally different from this After allowing the reality of the miracle he had a great deal to do to persuade himself that Jesus was the Messiah This is clearly intimated by various passages of the gospel history It appears that in the apprehension of the writers  of the New Testament the miracles did not irresistibly carry even those who saw them to the conclusion intended to be drawn from them or so compel assent as to leave no room for suspense for the exercise of candour or the effects of prejudice And to this point at least the evangelists may be allowed to be good witnesses because it is a point in which exaggeration or disguise would have been the other way Their accounts if they could be suspected of falsehood would rather have magnified than diminished the effects of the miracles  John vii "Jesus answered and said unto them I have done one work and ye all marvelIf a man on the Sabbathday receive circumcision that the law of Moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbathday Judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment Then said some of them of Jerusalem Is not this he whom they seek to kill but lo he speaketh boldly  and they say nothing to him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ  Howbeit we know this man whence he is but when Christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is  Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught saying Ye both know me and ye know whence I am and I am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not but I know him for I am from him and he hath sent me Then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come  and many of the people believed on him and said When Christ cometh will he do more miracles than those which this man hath done"  This passage is very observable It exhibits the reasoning of different sorts of persons upon the occasion of a miracle which persons of all sorts are represented to have acknowledged as real One sort of men thought that there was something very extraordinary in all this but that still Jesus could not be the Christ because there was  a circumstance in his appearance which militated with an opinion concerning Christ in which they had been brought up and of the truth of which it is probable they had never entertained a particle of doubt viz that "when Christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is" Another sort were inclined to believe him to be the Messiah But even these did not argue as we should did not consider the miracle as of itself decisive of the question as what if once allowed excluded all farther debate upon the subject but founded their opinion upon a kind of comparative reasoning "When Christ cometh will he do  more  miracles than those which this man hath done"  Another passage in the same evangelist and observable for the same purpose is that in which he relates the resurrection of Lazarus "Jesus" he tells us xi "when he had thus spoken cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was  bound about with a napkin Jesus faith unto them Loose him and let him go" One might have expected that at least all those who stood by the sepulchre when Lazarus was raised would have believed in Jesus Yet the evangelist does not so represent it "Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did believed on him but  some of them  went their ways to the Pharisees and told them what things Jesus had done" We cannot suppose that the evangelist meant by this account to leave his readers to imagine that any of the spectators doubted about the truth of the miracle Far from it Unquestionably he states the miracle to have been fully allowed yet the persons who allowed it were according to his representation capable of retaining hostile sentiments towards Jesus "Believing in Jesus" was not only to believe that he wrought miracles but that he was the Messiah With us there is no difference between these two things with them there was the greatest And the difference is apparent in this transaction If  St John has represented the conduct of the Jews upon this occasion truly and why he should not I cannot tell for it rather makes against him than for him it shews clearly the principles upon which their judgment proceeded Whether he has related the matter truly or not the relation itself discovers the writer's own opinion of those principles and that alone possesses considerable authority In the next chapter we have a reflection of the evangelist entirely suited to this state of the case "but though he had done so many miracles before them yet believed they not on him  xii  " The evangelist does not mean to impute the defect of their belief to any doubt about the miracles but to their not perceiving what all now sufficiently perceive and what they would have perceived had not their understandings been governed by strong prejudices the infallible attestation which the works of Jesus bore to the truth of his pretensions  The ninth chapter of St John's gospel contains a very circumstantial account of the cure of a blind man a miracle submitted to all the scrutiny and examination which a sceptic could propose If a modern unbeliever had drawn up the interrogatories they could hardly have been more critical or searching The account contains also a very curious conference between the Jewish rulers and the patient in which the point for our present notice is their resistance of the force of the miracle and of the conclusion to which it led after they had failed in discrediting its evidence "We know that God spake unto Moses but as for this fellow we know not whence he is" That was the answer which set their minds at rest And by the help of much prejudice and great unwillingness to yield it might do so In the mind of the poor man restored to sight which was under no such biass felt no such reluctance the miracle had its natural operation "Herein" says he "is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is yet he hath opened  mine eyes Now we know that God heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of God and doeth his will him he heareth Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind If this man were not of God he could do nothing" We do not find that the Jewish rulers had any other reply to make to this defence than that which authority is sometimes apt to make to argument "Dost thou teach us"  If it shall be enquired how a turn of thought so different from what prevails at present should obtain currency with the ancient Jews the answer is found in two opinions which are proved to have subsisted in that age and country The one was their expectation of a Messiah of a kind totally contrary to what the appearance of Jesus bespoke him to be the other their persuasion of the agency of demons in the production of supernatural effects These opinions are not  supposed  by us for the purpose of argument but are evidently recognised  in the Jewish writings as well as in ours And it ought moreover to be considered that in these opinions the Jews of that age had been from their infancy brought up that they were opinions the grounds of which they had probably few of them enquired into and of the truth of which they entertained no doubt And I think that these two opinions conjointly afford an explanation of their conduct The first put them upon seeking out some excuse to themselves for not receiving Jesus in the character in which he claimed to be received and the second supplied them with just such an excuse as they wanted Let Jesus work what miracles he would still the answer was in readiness "that he wrought them by the assistance of Beelzebub" And to this answer no reply could be made but that which our Saviour did make by shewing that the tendency of his mission was so adverse to the views with which this Being was by the objectors themselves supposed to act that it could not reasonably be supposed that he would  assist in carrying it on The power displayed in the miracles did not alone refute the Jewish solution because the interposition of invisible agents being once admitted it is impossible to ascertain the limits by which their efficiency is circumscribed We of this day may be disposed possibly to think such opinions too absurd to have been ever seriously entertained I am not bound to contend for the credibility of the opinions They were at least as reasonable as the belief in witchcraft They were opinions in which the Jews of that age had from their infancy been instructed and those who cannot see enough in the force of this reason to account for their conduct towards our Saviour do not sufficiently consider how such opinions may sometimes become very general in a country and with what pertinacity when once become so they are for that reason alone adhered to In the suspense which these notions and the prejudices resulting from them might occasion the candid and docile and humble minded would probably decide in Christ's  favour the proud and obstinate together with the giddy and the thoughtless almost universally against him  This state of opinion discovers to us also the reason of what some choose to wonder at why the Jews should reject miracles when they saw them yet rely so much upon the tradition of them in their own history It does not appear that it had ever entered into the minds of those who lived in the time of Moses and the Prophets to ascribe  their  miracles to the supernatural agency of evil Beings The solution was not then invented And the authority of Moses and the Prophets being established and become the foundation of the national policy and religion it was not probable that the later Jews brought up in a reverence for that religion and the subjects of that policy should apply to their history a reasoning which tended to overthrow the foundation of both  II The infidelity of the gentile world  and that more especially of men of rank and learning in it is resolvable into a principle which in my judgment will account for the inefficacy of any argument or any evidence whatever viz contempt prior to examination The state of religion amongst the Greeks and Romans had a natural tendency to induce this disposition Dionysius Halicarnassensis remarks that there were six hundred different kinds of religions or sacred rites exercised at Rome  Jortin's remarks on Eccl Hist vol i p  The superior classes of the community treated them all as fables Can we wonder then that Christianity was included in the number without enquiry into its separate merits or the particular grounds of its pretensions It might be either true or false for any thing they knew about it The religion had nothing in its character which immediately engaged their notice It mixed with no politics It produced no fine writers It contained no curious speculations When it did reach their knowledge I doubt not but that  it appeared to them a very strange systemso unphilosophicaldealing so little in argument and discussion in such arguments however and discussions as they were accustomed to entertain What is said of Jesus Christ of his nature office and ministry would be in the highest degree aliene from the conceptions of their theology The redeemer and the destined judge of the human race a poor young man executed at Jerusalem with two thieves upon a cross Still more would the language in which the Christian doctrine was delivered be dissonant and barbarous to their ears What knew they of grace of redemption of justification of the blood of Christ shed for the sins of men of reconcilement of mediation Christianity was made up of points they had never thought of of terms which they had never heard  It was presented also to the imagination of the learned heathen under additional disadvantage by reason of its real and still more of its nominal connection with Judaism  It shared in the obloquy and ridicule with which that people and their religion were treated by the Greeks and Romans They regarded Jehovah himself only as the idol of the Jewish nation and what was related of him as of a piece with what was told of the tutelar deities of other countries nay the Jews were in a particular manner ridiculed for being a credulous race so that whatever reports of a miraculous nature came out of that country were looked upon by the heathen world as false and frivolous When they heard of Christianity they heard of it as a quarrel amongst this people about some articles of their own superstition Despising therefore as they did the whole system it was not probable that they would enter with any degree of seriousness or attention into the detail of its disputes or the merits of either side How little they knew and with what carelessness they judged of these matters appears I think pretty plainly from an example of no less weight than that of Tacitus who in a grave and professed discourse upon the  history of the Jews states that they worshipped the effigy of an ass  Tac Hist lib v c  The passage is a proof how prone the learned men of these times were and upon how little evidence to heap together stories which might increase the contempt and odium in which that people was held The same foolish charge is also considently repeated by Plutarch  Sympos lib iv ques    It is observable that all these considerations are of a nature to operate with the greatest force upon the highest ranks upon men of education and that order of the public from which  writers  are principally taken I may add also upon the philosophical as well as the libertine character upon the Antonines or Julian not less than upon Nero or Domitian and more particularly upon that large and polished class of men who acquiesced in the general persuasion that all they had to do was to practise the duties of morality and to worship the deity  more patrio  a habit of thinking liberal as it may appear which shuts the door against every argument for a new religion The considerations abovementioned would acquire also strength from the prejudice which men of rank and learning universally entertain against any thing that  originates  with the vulgar and illiterate which prejudice is known to be as obstinate as any prejudice whatever  Yet Christianity was still making its way and amidst so many impediments to its progress so much difficulty in procuring audience and attention its actual success is more to be wondered at than that it should not have universally conquered scorn and indifference fixed the levity of a voluptuous age or through a cloud of adverse prejudications opened for itself a passage to the hearts and understandings of the scholars of the age  And the cause which is here assigned for the rejection of Christianity by men of  rank and learning among the heathens namely a strong antecedent contempt accounts also for their  silence  concerning it If they had rejected it upon examination they would have written about it They would have given their reasons Whereas what men repudiate upon the strength of some prefixed persuasion or from a settled contempt of the subject of the persons who propose it or of the manner in which it is proposed they do not naturally write books about or notice much in what they write upon other subjects  The letters of the younger Pliny furnish an example of this silence and let us in some measure into the cause of it From his celebrated correspondence with Trajan we know that the Christian religion prevailed in a very considerable degree in the province over which he presided that it had excited his attention that he had enquired into the matter just so much as a Roman magistrate might be expected to enquire viz whether the religion contained any opinions  dangerous̄ to government but that of its doctrines its evidences or its books he had not taken the trouble to inform himself with any degree of care or correctness But although Pliny had viewed Christianity in a nearer position than most of his learned countrymen saw it in yet he had regarded the whole with such negligence and disdain farther than as it seemed to concern his administration that in more than two hundred and forty letters of his which have come down to us the subject is never once again mentioned If out of this number the two letters between him and Trajan had been lost with what confidence would the obscurity of the Christian religion have been argued from Pliny's silence about it and with how little truth  The name and character which Tacitus hath given to Christianity "exitiabilis superstitio" a pernicious superstition and by which two words he disposes of the whole question of the merits or demerits of the religion afford a strong proof how little  he knew or concerned himself to know about the matter I apprehend that I shall not be contradicted when I take upon me to assert that no unbeliever of the present age would apply this epithet to the Christianity of the New Testament or not allow that it was entirely unmerited Read the instructions given by a great teacher of the religion to those very Roman converts of whom Tacitus speaks and given also a very few years before the time of which he is speaking and which are not let it be observed a collection of fine sayings brought together from different parts of a large work but stand in one entire passage of a public letter without the intermixture of a single thought which is frivolous or exceptionable "Abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another Not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the Lord rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality  Bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep Be of the same mind one towards another mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate Be not wise in your own conceits Recompense to no man evil for evil Provide things honest in the sight of all men If it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men Avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written Vengeance is mine I will repay faith the Lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head Be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good"  "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of God the powers that be are ordained of God whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive unto themselves  damnation For rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power Do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same for he is the minister of God to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of God a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil Wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are God's ministers attending continually upon this very thing Render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour"  "Owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any commandment it  is briefly comprehended in this saying Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself Love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the law"  "And that knowing the time that now is our salvation nearer than when we believed The night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light Let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying  Rom xii xiii  "  Read this and then think of exitiabilis superstitioOr if we be not allowed in contending with heathen authorities to produce our books against theirs we may at least be permitted to confront theirs with one another Of this "pernicious superstition" what could  Pliny  sind to blame when he was led by his office to institute something like an examination into the conduct and  principles of the sect He discovered nothing but that they were wont to meet together on a stated day before it was light and sing among themselves a hymn to Christ as a God and to bind themselves by an oath not to the commission of any wickedness but not to be guilty of theft robbery or adultery never to falsify their word nor to deny a pledge committed to them when called upon to return it  Upon the words of Tacitus we may build the following observations  First That we are well warranted in calling the view under which the learned men of that age beheld Christianity an obscure and distant view Had Tacitus known more of Christianity of its precepts duties constitution or design however he had discredited the story he would have respected the principle He would have described the religion differently though he had rejected it It has been very satisfactorily shewn that the "superstition" of the Christians consisted  in worshiping a person unknown to the Roman calendar and that the "perniciousness" with which they were reproached was nothing else but there opposition to the established polytheism and this view of the matter was just such a one as might be expected to occur to a mind which held the sect in too much contempt to concern itself about the grounds and reasons of their conduct  Secondly We may from hence remark how little reliance can be placed upon the most acute judgments in subjects which they are pleased to despise and which of course they from the first consider as unworthy to be enquired into Had not Christianity survived to tell its own story it must have gone down to posterity as a "pernicious superstition" and that upon the credit of Tacitus's account much I doubt not strengthened by the name of the writer and the reputation of his sagacity  Thirdly That this contempt prior to  examination is an intellectual vice from which the greatest faculties of mind are not free I know not indeed whether men of the greatest faculties of mind are not the most subject to it Such men feel themselves seated upon an eminence Looking down from their height upon the follies of mankind they behold contending tenets wasting their idle strength upon one another with a common disdain of the absurdity of them all This habit of thought however comfortable to the mind which entertains it or however natural to great parts is extremely dangerous and more apt than almost any other disposition to produce hasty and contemptuous and by consequence erroneous judgments both of persons and opinions  Fourthly We need not be surprised at many writers of that age not mentioning Christianity at all when they who did mention it appear to have entirely misconceived its nature and character and in consequence  of this misconception to have regarded it with negligence and contempt  To the knowledge of the greatest part of the learned heathens the facts of the Christian history could only come by report The books probably they had never looked into The settled habit of their minds was and long had been an indiscriminate rejection of all reports of the kind With these sweeping conclusions truth hath no chance It depends upon distinction If they would not enquire how should they be convinced It might be founded in truth though they who made no search might not discover it  "Men of rank and fortune of wit and abilities are often found even in Christian countries to be surprisingly ignorant of religion and of every thing that relates to it Such were many of the heathens Their thoughts were all fixed upon other things upon reputation and glory upon wealth and  power upon luxury and pleasure upon business or learning They thought and they had reason to think that the religion of their country was fable and forgery an heap of inconsistent lies which inclined them to suppose that other religions were no better Hence it came to pass that when the Apostles preached the gospel and wrought miracles in confirmation of a doctrine every way worthy of God many Gentiles knew little or nothing of it and would not take the least pains to inform themselves about it This appears plainly from ancient history  Jortin's Dis on the Chris Rel p ed th  "  I think it by no means unreasonable to suppose that the heathen public especially that part which is made up of men of rank and education were divided into two classes those who despised Christianity beforehand and those who received it In correspondency with which division of character the  writers of that age would also be of two classes those who were silent about Christianity and those who were Christians "A good man who attended sufficiently to the Christian affairs would become a Christian after which his testimony ceased to be Pagan and became Christian  Hartley Obs p  "  I must also add that I think it sufficiently proved that the notion of magic was resorted to by the heathen adversaries of Christianity in like manner as that of diabolical agency had before been by the Jews Justin Martyr alledges this as his reason for arguing from prophecy rather than from miracles Origen imputes this evasion to Celsus Jerome to Porphyry and Lactantius to the heathen in general The several passages which contain these testimonies will be produced in the next chapter It being difficult however to ascertain in what degree this notion prevailed especially amongst  the superior ranks of the heathen communities another and I think an adequate cause has been assigned for their infidelity It is probable that in many cases the two causes would operate together  CHAP V That the Christian miracles are not recited or appealed to by early Christian writers themselves so fully or frequently as might have been expected  I SHALL consider this objection first as it applies to the letters of the Apostles preserved in the New Testament and secondly as it applies to the remaining writings of other early Christians  The epistles of the apostles are either hortatory or argumentative So far as they were occupied in delivering lessons of duty rules of public order admonitions against certain prevailing corruptions against vice or any particular species of it or in fortifying and encouraging the constancy of the disciples under the trials to which they were exposed there appears to be no place or  occasion for more of these references than we actually find  So far as the epistles are argumentative the nature of the argument which they handle accounts for the infrequency of these allusions These epistles were not written to prove the truth of Christianity The subject under consideration was not that which the miracles decided the reality of our Lord's mission but it was that which the miracles did not decide the nature of his person or power the design of his advent its effects and of those effects the value kind and extent Still I maintain that miraculous evidence lies at the bottom of the argument For nothing could be so preposterous as for the disciples of Jesus to dispute amongst themselves or with others concerning his office or character unless they believed that he had shewn by supernatural proofs that there was something extraordinary in both Miraculous evidence therefore forming not the texture of these  arguments but the ground and substratum if it be occasionally discerned if it be incidentally appealed to it is exactly so much as ought to take place supposing the history to be true  As a further answer to the objection that the apostolic epistles do not contain so frequent or such direct and circumstantial recitals of miracles as might be expected I would add  that the apostolic epistles resemble in this respect the apostolic speeches  which speeches are given by a writer who distinctly records numerous miracles wrought by these apostles themselves and by the founder of the institution in their presence that it is unwarrantable to contend that the omission or infrequency of such recitals in the speeches of the apostles negatives the existence of the miracles when the speeches are given in immediate conjunction with the history of those miracles and that a conclusion which cannot be inferred from the speeches without contradicting the whole  tenor of the book which contains them cannot be inferred from letters which in this respect are similar only to the speeches  To prove the similitude which we alledge it may be remarked that although in St Luke's gospel the apostle Peter is represented to have been present at many decisive miracles wrought by Christ and although the second part of the same history ascribes other decisive miracles to Peter himself particularly the cure of the lame man at the gate of the temple Acts iii the death of Ananias and Sapphira Acts v the cure of Aeneas Acts ix the resurrection of Dorcas Acts ix yet out of six speeches of Peter preserved in the Acts I know but two in which reference is made to the miracles wrought by Christ and only one in which he refers to miraculous powers possessed by himself In his speech upon the day of Pentecost Peter addresses his audience with great solemnity thus "Ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among  you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know c  Acts ii  " In his speech upon the conversion of Cornelius he delivers his testimony to the miracles performed by Christ in these words "We are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem  x  " But in this latter speech no allusion appears to the miracles wrought by himself notwithstanding that the miracles above enumerated all preceded the time in which it was delivered In his speech upon the election of Matthias  i  no distinct reference is made to any of the miracles of Christ's history except his resurrection The same also may be observed of his speech upon the cure of the lame man at the gate of the temple  iii  the same in his speech before the Sanhedrim  iv  the same in his second apology in the presence of that assembly Stephen's long speech contains no reference whatever to  miracles though it be expressly related of him in the book which preserves the speech and almost immediately before the speech "that he did great wonders and miracles among the people  Acts vi  " Again although miracles be expressly attributed to St Paul in the Acts of the Apostles first generally as at Iconium Acts xiv during the whole tour through the Upper Asia xiv xv at Ephesus xix secondly in specific instances as the blindness of Elymas at Paphos  xiii  the cure of the cripple at Lystra  xiv  of the Pythoness at Philippi  xvi  the miraculous liberation from prison in the same city  xvi  the restoration of Eutychus  xx  the predictions of his shipwreck  xxvii  the viper at Milita  xxviii  the cure of Publius's father  xxviii  at all which miracles except the two first the historian himself was present notwithstanding I say this positive ascription of miracles to St Paul yet in the speeches delivered by him and given as delivered  by him in the same book in which the miracles are related and the miraculous powers asserted the appeals to his own miracles or indeed to any miracles at all are rare and incidental In his speech at Antioch in Pisidia  Acts xiii  there is no allusion but to the resurrection In his discourse at Miletus  xx  none to any miracle none in his speech before Felix  xxiv  none in his speech before Festus  xxv  except to Christ's resurrection and his own conversion  Agreeably hereunto in thirteen letters ascribed to St Paul we have incessant references to Christ's resurrection frequent references to his own conversion three indubitable references to the miracles which he wrought  Gal iii Rom xv Cor xii  four other references to the same less direct yet highly probable  Cor ii Eph iii Gal ii Thess i  but more copious or circumstantial recitals we have not The consent therefore between St Paul's speeches and letters is in this respect  sufficiently exact and the reason in both is the same namely that the miraculous history was all along  presupposed  and that the question which occupied the speaker's and the writer's thoughts was this whether allowing the history of Jesus to be true he was upon the strength of it to be received as the promised Messiah and if he was what were the consequences what was the object and benefit of his mission  The general observation which has been made upon the apostolic writings namely that the subject of which they treated did not lead them to any direct recital of the Christian history belongs also to the writings of the apostolic fathers The epistle of Barnabas is in its subject and general composition much like the epistle to the Hebrews an allegorical application of divers passages of the Jewish history of their law and ritual to those parts of the Christian dispensation in which the author perceived a resemblance The epistle of Clement was written for the sole purpose of  quieting certain dissensions that had arisen amongst the members of the church of Corinth and of reviving in their minds that temper and spirit of which their predecessors in the gospel had left them an example The work of Hermas is a vision quotes neither the Old Testament nor the New and merely falls now and then into the language and the mode of speech which the author had read in our gospels The epistles of Polycarp and Ignatius had for their principal object the order and discipline of the churches which they addressed Yet under all these circumstances of disadvantage the great points of the Christian history are fully recognized This hath been shewn in its proper place  Vol i p    There is however another class of writers to whom the answer above given viz the unsuitableness of any such appeals or references as the objection demands to the subjects of which the writings treated does  not apply and that is the class of ancient  apologists  whose declared design it was to defend Christianity and to give the reasons of their adherence to it It is necessary therefore to enquire how the matter of the objection stands in these  The most ancient apologist of whose works we have the smallest knowledge is Quadratus Quadratus lived about seventy years after the ascension and presented his apology to the emperor Adrian From a passage of this work preserved in Eusebius it appears that the author did directly and formally appeal to the miracles of Christ and in terms as express and consident as we could desire The passage which has been once already stated is as follows "The works of our Saviour were always conspicuous for they were real both they that were healed and they that were raised from the dead were seen not only when they were healed or raised but for a long time afterwards not only whilst he dwelled on this earth but also after his departure and for a  good while after it insomuch as that some of them have reached to our times  Eus Hist l iv c  " Nothing can be more rational or satisfactory than this  Justin Martyr the next of the Christian apologists whose work is not lost and who followed Quadratus at the distance of about thirty years has touched upon passages of Christ's history in so many places that a tolerably complete account of Christ's life might be collected out of his works In the following quotation he asserts the performance of miracles by Christ in words as strong and positive as the language possesses "Christ healed those who from their birth were blind and deaf and lame causing by his word one to leap another to hear and a third to see and having raised the dead and caused them to live he by his works excited attention and induced the men of that age to know him Who however seeing these things done said that it was a  magical appearance and dared to call him a magician and a deceiver of the people  Just dial p ed Thirlby  "  In his first apology  Ap prim p ib  Justin expressly assigns the reason for his having recourse to the argument from prophecy rather than alledging the miracles of the Christian history which reason was that the persons with whom he contended would ascribe these miracles to magic "lest any of our opponents should say What hinders but that he who is called Christ by us being a man sprung from men performed the miracles which we attributed to him by magical art" The suggesting of this reason meets as I apprehend the very point of the present objection more especially when we find Justin followed in it by other writers of that age Irenaeus who came about forty years after him notices the same evasion in the adversaries of Christianity and replies to it by the same argument "But if  they shall say that the Lord performed these things by an illusory appearance  leading these objectors to the prophecies we will shew from them that all things were thus predicted concerning him and strictly came to pass  Ir l ii c  " Lactantius who lived a century lower delivers the same sentiment upon the same occasion "He performed miracleswe might have supposed him to have been a magician as ye say and as the Jews then supposed if all the prophets had not with one spirit foretold that Christ would perform these very things  Lact v  "  But to return to the Christian apologists in their order Tertullian"That person whom the Jews had vainly imagined from the meanness of his appearance to be a mere man they afterwards in consequence of the power he exerted considered as a magician when he with one word ejected devils out of the bodies of men gave sight  to the blind cleansed the leprous strengthened the nerves of those that had the palsy and lastly with one command restored the dead to life when he I say made the very elements obey him assuaged the storms walked upon the seas demonstrating himself to be the word of God  Tertull Apolog p ed Priorii Par  "  Next in the catalogue of professed apologists we may place Origen who it is well known published a formal defence of Christianity in answer to Celsus a heathen who had written a discourse against it I know no expressions by which a plainer or more positive appeal to the Christian miracles can be made than the expressions used by Origen "Undoubtedly we do think him to be the Christ and the Son of God because he healed the lame and the blind and we are the more confirmed in this persuasion by what is written in the prophecies Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf shall hear and the lame men shall  leap as an hart But that he also raised the dead and that it is not a fiction of those who wrote the Gospels is evident from hence that if it had been a fiction there would have been many recorded to be raised up and such as had been a long time in their graves But it not being a fiction few have been recorded for instance the daughter of the ruler of a synagogue of whom I do not know why he said she is not dead but sleepeth expressing something peculiar to her not common to all dead persons and the only son of a widow on whom he had compassion and raised him to life after he had bid the bearer of the corpse to stop and the third Lazarus who had been buried four days" This is positively to assert the miracles of Christ and it is also to comment upon them and that with a considerable degree of accuracy and candour  In another passage of the same author  Or con Cels lib ii sec  we meet with the old solution of magic  applied to the miracles of Christ by the adversaries of the religion "Celsus" faith Origen "well knowing what great works may be alledged to have been done by Jesus pretends to grant that the things related of him are true such as healing diseases raising the dead feeding multitudes with a few loaves of which large fragments were left" And then Celsus gives it seems an answer to these proofs of our Lord's mission which as Origen understood it resolved the phenomena into magic for Origen begins his reply by observing "You see that Celsus in a manner allows that there is such a thing as magic  Lard Jewish and Heath Test vol ii p ed quarto  "  It appears also from the testimony of St Jerome that Porphyry the most learned and able of the heathen writers against Christianity resorted to the same solution "Unless" says he speaking to Vigilantius "according to the manner of the Gentiles and  the profane of  Porphyry  and Eunomius you pretend that these are the tricks of demons  Jerome con Vigil  "  This magic these demons this illusory appearance this comparison with the tricks of jugglers by which many of that age accounted so easily for the Christian miracles and which answers the advocates of Christianity often thought it necessary to refute by arguments drawn from other topics and particularly from prophecy to which it seems these solutions did not apply we now perceive to be gross subterfuges That such reasons were ever seriously urged and seriously received is only a proof what a gloss and varnish fashion can give to any opinion  It appears therefore that the miracles of Christ understood as we understand them in their literal and historical sense were positively and precisely asserted and appealed  to by the apologists for Christianity which answers the allegation of the objection  I am ready however to admit that the ancient Christian advocates did not insist upon the miracles in argument so frequently as I should have done It was their lot to contend with notions of magical agency against which the mere production of the facts was not sufficient for the convincing of their adversaries I do not know whether they themselves thought it quite decisive of the controversy But since it is proved I conceive with certainty that the sparingness with which they appealed to miracles was owing neither to their ignorance nor their doubt of the facts it is at any rate an objection not to the truth of the history but to the judgment of its defenders  CHAP VI Want of universality in the knowledge and reception of Christianity and of greater clearness in the evidence  OF a revelation which really came from God the proof it has been said would in all ages be so public and manifest that no part of the human species would remain ignorant of it no understanding could fail of being convinced by it  The advocates of Christianity do not pretend that the evidence of their religion possesses these qualities They do not deny that we can conceive it to be within the compass of divine power to have communicated to the world a higher degree of assurance and to have given to his communication a stronger and more extensive influence For any thing we are able to discern  God  could  have so formed men as to have perceived the truths of religion intuitively or to have carried on a communication with the other world whilst they lived in this or to have seen the individuals of the species instead of dying pass to heaven by a sensible translation He could have presented a separate miracle to each man's senses He could have established a standing miracle He could have caused miracles to be wrought in every different age and country These and many more methods which we may imagine if we once give loose to our imaginations are so far as we can judge all practicable  The question therefore is not whether Christianity possesses the highest possible degree of evidence but whether the not having more evidence be a sufficient reason for rejecting that which we have  Now there appears to be no fairer method of judging concerning any dispensation which is alledged to come from God when  a question is made whether such a dispensation could come from God or not than by comparing it with other things which are acknowledged to proceed from the same council and to be produced by the same agency If the dispensation in question labour under no defects but what apparently belong to other dispensations these seeming defects do not justify us in setting aside the proofs which are offered of its authenticity if they be otherwise entitled to credit  Throughout that order then of nature of which God is the author what we find is a system of  beneficence  we are seldom or ever able to make out a system of  optimism  I mean that there are few cases in which if we permit ourselves to range in possibilities we cannot suppose something more perfect and more unobjectionable than what we see The rain which descends from heaven is confessedly amongst the contrivances of the Creator for the sustentation of the animals and vegetables which subsist upon the surface of the earth Yet how partially  and irregularly is it supplied How much of it falls upon the sea where it can be of no use how often is it wanted where it would be of the greatest What tracts of continent are rendered desarts by the scarcity of it Or not to speak of extreme cases how much sometimes do inhabited countries suffer by its deficiency or delayWe could imagine if to imagine were our business the matter to be otherwise regulated We could imagine showers to fall just where and when they would do good always seasonable everywhere sufficient so distributed as not to leave a field upon the face of the globe scorched by drought or even a plant withering for the lack of moisture Yet does the difference between the real case and the imagined case or the seeming inferiority of the one to the other authorize us to say that the present disposition of the atmosphere is not amongst the productions or the designs of the Deity Does it check the inference which we draw from the confessed beneficence of the provision or does it make us cease to admire the contrivance  The observation which we have exemplified in the single instance of the rain of heaven may be repeated concerning most of the phenomena of nature and the true conclusion to which it leads is this that to enquire what the Deity might have done could have done or as we even sometimes presume to speak ought to have done or in hypothetical cases would have done and to build any propositions upon such enquiries against evidence of facts is wholly unwarrantable It is a mode of reasoning which will not do in natural history which will not do in natural religion which cannot therefore be applied with safety to revelation It may have some foundation in certain speculative  apriori  ideas of the divine attributes but it has none in experience or in analogy The general character of the works of nature is on the one hand goodness both in design and effect and on the other hand a liability to difficulty and to objections if such objections be allowed by reason of seeming incompleteness or uncertainty in attaining their end Christianity participates of this character  The true similitude between nature and revelation consists in this that they each bear strong marks of their original that they each also bear appearances of irregularity and defect A system of strict optimism may nevertheless be the real system in both cases But what I contend is that the proof is hidden from  us  that we ought not to expect to perceive that in revelation which we hardly perceive in any thing that beneficence of which we  can  judge ought to satisfy us that optimism of which we  cannot  judge ought not to be sought after We can judge of beneficence because it depends upon effects which we experience and upon the relation between the means which we see acting and the ends which we see produced We cannot judge of optimism because it necessarily implies a comparison of that which is tried with that which is not tried of consequences which we see with others which we imagine and concerning many of which it is more than probable we know nothing concerning some that we have no notion  If Christianity be compared with the state and progress of natural religion the argument of the objector will gain nothing by the comparison I remember hearing an unbeliever say that if God had given a revelation he would have written it in the skies Are the truths of natural religion written in the skies or in a language which every one reads or is this the case with the most useful arts or the most necessary sciences of human life An Otaheitean or an Esquimaux knows nothing of Christianity does he know more of the principles of deism or morality which notwithstanding his ignorance are neither untrue nor unimportant nor uncertain The existence of the Deity is left to be collected from observations which every man does not make which every man perhaps is not capable of making Can it be argued that God does not exist because if he did he would let us see him or discover himself to mankind by proofs such as we may think the nature of the subject merited which no inadvertency could miss no prejudice withstand  If Christianity be regarded as a providential instrument for the melioration of mankind its progress and diffusion resembles that of other causes by which human life is improved The diversity is not greater nor the advance more slow in religion than we find it to be in learning liberty government laws The Deity hath not touched the order of nature in vain The Jewish religion produced great and permanent effects the Christian religion hath done the same It hath disposed the world to amendment It hath put things in a train It is by no means improbable that it may become universal and that the world may continue in that state so long as that the duration of its reign may bear a vast proportion to the time of its partial influence  When we argue concerning Christianity that it must necessarily be true because it is beneficial we go perhaps too far on one side and we certainly go too far on the other when we conclude that it must be false because it is not so efficacious as we could have  supposed The question of its truth is to be tried upon its proper evidence without deferring much to this sort of argument on either side "The evidence" as Bishop Butler hath rightly observed "depends upon the judgment we form of human conduct under given circumstances of which it may be presumed that we know something the objection stands upon the supposed conduct of the Deity under relations with which we are not acquainted"  What would be the real effect of that overpowering evidence which our adversaries require in a revelation it is difficult to foretell at least we must speak of it as of a dispensation of which we have no experience Some consequences however would it is probable attend this oeconomy which do not seem to besit a revelation that proceeded from God One is that irresistible proof would restrain the voluntary powers too much would not answer the purpose of trial and probation would call for no exercise of candour seriousness humility enquiry no  submission of passions interests and prejudices to moral evidence and to probable truth no habits of reflection none of that previous desire to learn and to obey the will of God which forms perhaps the test of the virtuous principle and which induces men to attend with care and reverence to every credible intimation of that will and to resign present advantages and present pleasures to every reasonable expectation of propitiating his favour "Men's moral probation may be whether they will take due care to inform themselves by impartial consideration and afterwards whether they will act as the case requires upon the evidence which they have And this we find by experience is often our probation in our temporal capacity  Butler's Analogy part ii c vi  "  II These modes of communication would leave no place for the admission of  internal evidence  which ought perhaps to bear a considerable part in the proof of every revelation  because it is a species of evidence which applies itself to the knowledge love and practice of virtue and which operates in proportion to the degree of those qualities which it finds in the person whom it addresses Men of good dispositions amongst Christians are greatly affected by the impression which the scriptures themselves make upon their minds Their conviction is much strengthened by these impressions And this perhaps was intended to be one effect to be produced by the religion It is likewise true to whatever cause we ascribe it for I am not in this work at liberty to introduce the Christian doctrine of grace or assistance or the Christian promise "that if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God  John vii  "it is true I say that they who sincerely act or sincerely endeavour to act  according  to what they believe that is according to the just result of the probabilities or if you please the possibilities in natural and revealed  religion which they themselves perceive and according to a rational estimate of consequences and above all according to the just effect of those principles of gratitude and devotion which even the view of nature generates in a wellordered mind  seldom fail of proceeding farther  This also may have been exactly what was designed  Whereas may it not be said that irresistible evidence would confound all characters and all dispositions would subvert rather than promote the true purpose of the divine councils which is not to produce  obedience  by a force little short of mechanical constraint which obedience would be regularity not virtue and would hardly perhaps differ from that which inanimate bodies pay to the laws impressed upon their nature but to treat moral agents agreeably to what they are which is done when light and motives are of such kinds and are imparted in such measures that the influence of them depends upon the recipients themselves "It is not meet to govern rational free agents  in viâ by sight and sense It would be no trial or thanks to the most sensual wretch to forbear sinning if heaven and hell were open to his sight That spiritual vision and fruition is our state in patriâ" Baxter's Reasons p There may be truth in this thought though roughly expressed Few things are more improbable than that we the human species should be the highest order of beings in the universe that animated nature should ascend from the lowest reptile to us and all at once stop there If there be classes above us of rational intelligences clearer manifestations may belong to them This may be one of the distinctions And it may be one to which we ourselves hereafter shall attain  III But thirdly may it not also be asked whether the perfect display of a future state of existence would be compatible with the activity of civil life and with the success of human affairs I can easily conceive that this impression may be overdone that it may so seize and fill the thoughts as to  leave no place for the cares and offices of men's several stations no anxiety for worldly prosperity or even for a worldly provision and by consequence no sufficient stimulus to secular industry Of the first Christians we read "that all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need and continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart  Acts ii  " This was extremely natural and just what might be expected from miraculous evidence coming with full force upon the senses of mankind but I much doubt whether if this state of mind had been universal or long continued the business of the world could have gone on The necessary arts of social life would have been little cultivated The plough and the loom would have stood still Agriculture manufactures trade and navigation  would not I think have flourished if they could have been exercised at all Men would have addicted themselves to contemplative and ascetic lives instead of lives of business and of useful industry We observe that St Paul found it necessary frequently to recall his converts to the ordinary labours and domestic duties of their condition and to give them in his own example a lesson of contented application to their worldly employments  By the manner in which the religion is now proposed a great portion of the human species is enabled and of these multitudes of every generation are induced to seek and to effectuate their salvation through the medium of Christianity without interruption of the prosperity or of the regular course of human affairs  CHAP VII The supposed Effects of Christianity  THAT a religion which under every form in which it is taught holds forth the final reward of virtue and punishment of vice and proposes those distinctions of virtue and vice which the wisest and most cultivated part of mankind confess to be just should not be believed is very possible but that so far as it is believed it should not produce any good but rather a bad effect upon public happiness is a proposition which it requires very strong evidence to render credible Yet many have been found to contend for this paradox and very confident appeals have been made to history and to observation for the truth of it  In the conclusions however which these writers draw from what they call experience  two sources I think of mistake may be perceived  One is that they look for the influence of religion in the wrong place  The other that they charge Christianity with many consequences for which it is not responsible  The influence of religion is not to be sought for in the councils of princes in the debates or resolutions of popular assemblies in the conduct of governments towards their subjects or of states and sovereigns towards one another of conquerors at the head of their armies or of parties intriguing for power at home topics which alone almost occupy the attention and fill the pages of history but must be perceived if perceived at all in the silent course of private and domestic life Nay more even  there  its influence may not be very obvious to observation If it check in some degree personal dissoluteness if it beget a general probity  in the transaction of business if it produce soft and humane manners in the mass of the community and occasional exertions of laborious or expensive benevolence in a few individuals it is all the effect which can offer itself to external notice The kingdom of Heaven is within us That which is the substance of the religion its hopes and consolations its intermixture with the thoughts by day and by night the devotion of the heart the control of appetite the steady direction of the will to the commands of God is necessarily invisible Yet upon these depend the virtue and the happiness of millions This cause renders the representations of history with respect to religion defective and fallacious in a greater degree than they are upon any other subject Religion operates most upon those of whom history knows the least upon fathers and mothers in their families upon men servants and maid servants upon the orderly tradesman the quiet villager the manufacturer at his loom the husbandman in his fields Amongst such its influence collectively may  be of inestimable value yet its effects in the mean time little upon those who figure upon the stage of the world  They  may know nothing of it they may believe nothing of it they may be actuated by motives more impetuous than those which religion is able to excite It cannot therefore be thought strange that this influence should elude the grasp and touch of public history for what is public history but a register of the successes and disappointments the vices the follies and the quarrels of those who engage in contentions for power  I will add that much of this influence may be felt in times of public distress and little of it in times of public wealth and security This also increases the uncertainty of any opinions that we draw from historical representations The influence of Christianity is commensurate with no effects which history states We do not pretend that it has any such necessary and irresistible power over the affairs of nations as to surmount the force of other causes  The Christian religion also acts upon public usages and institutions by an operation which is only secondary and indirect Christianity is not a code of civil law It can only reach public institutions through private character Now its influence upon private character may be considerable yet many public usages and institutions repugnant to its principles may remain To get rid of these the reigning part of the community must act and act together But it may be long before the persons who compose this body be sufficiently touched with the Christian character to join in the suppression of practices to which they and the public have been reconciled by causes which will reconcile the human mind to any thing by habit and interest Nevertheless the effects of Christianity even in this view have been important It has mitigated the conduct of war and the treatment of captives It has softened the administration of despotic or of nominally despotic governments It has abolished polygamy It has restrained the licentiousness of divorces It has put  an end to the exposure of children and the immolation of slaves It has suppressed the combats of gladiators  Lipsius affirms Sat b i c that the gladiatorial shows sometimes cost Europe twenty or thirty thousand lives in a month and that not only the men but even the women of all ranks were passionately fond of these shows See Bishop Porteus's Sermon XIII  and the impurities of religious rites It has banished if not unnatural vices at least the toleration of them It has greatly meliorated the condition of the laborious part that is to say of the mass of every community by procuring for them a day of weekly rest In all countries in which it is professed it has produced numerous establishments for the relief of sickness and poverty and in some a regular and general provision by law It has triumphed over the slavery established in the Roman empire it is contending and I trust will one day prevail against the worse slavery of the West Indies  A Christian writer  Bardesanes ap Euseb Praep Evang vi  so early as in the  second century has testified the resistance which Christianity made to wicked and licentious practices though established by law and by public usage "Neither in Parthia do the Christians though Parthians use polygamy nor in Persia though Persians do they marry their own daughters nor among the Bactri or Galli do they violate the sanctity of marriage nor wherever they are do they suffer themselves to be overcome by illconstituted laws and manners"  Socrates did not destroy the idolatry of Athens or produce the slightest revolution in the manners of his country  But the argument to which I recur is that the benefit of religion being felt chiefly in the obscurity of private stations necessarily escapes the observation of history From the first general notification of Christianity to the present day there have been in every age many millions whose names were never heard of made better by it not only in their conduct but in their disposition and happier  not so much in their external circumstances as in that which is  inter praecordia  in that which alone deserves the name of happiness the tranquillity and consolation of their thoughts It has been since its commencement the author of happiness and virtue to millions and millions of the human race Who is there that would not wish his son to be a Christian  Christianity also in every country in which it is professed hath obtained a sensible although not a complete influence upon the public judgment of morals And this is very important For without the occasional correction which public opinion receives by referring to some fixed standard of morality no man can foretell into what extravagancies it might wander Assassination might become as honourable as duelling unnatural crimes be accounted as venial as fornication is wont to be accounted In this way it is possible that many may be kept in order by Christianity who are not themselves Christians They may  be guided by the rectitude which it communicates to public opinion Their consciences may suggest their duty truly and they may ascribe these suggestions to a moral sense or to the native capacity of the human intellect when in fact they are nothing more than the public opinion reflected from their own minds an opinion in a considerable degree modified by the lessons of Christianity "Certain it is and this is a great deal to say that the generality even of the meanest and most vulgar and ignorant people have truer and worthier notions of God more just and right apprehensions concerning his attributes and perfections a deeper sense of the difference of good and evil a greater regard to moral obligations and to the plain and most necessary duties of life and a more firm and universal expectation of a future state of rewards and punishments than in any heathen country any considerable number of men were found to have had  Clark Ev Nat Rev p ed v  "  After all the value of Christianity is not to be appreciated by its  temporal  effects The object of revelation is to influence human conduct in this life but what is gained to happiness by that influence can only be estimated by taking in the whole of human existeiice Then as hath already been observed there may be also great consequences of Christianity which do not belong to it as a revelation The effects upon human salvation of the mission of the death of the present of the future agency of Christ may be universal though the religion be not universally known  Secondly I assert that Christianity is charged with many consequences for which it is not responsible I believe that religious motives have had no more to do in the formation of ninetenths of the intolerant and persecuting laws which in different countries have been established upon the subject of religion than they have had to do in England with the making of the game laws These measures although they have  the Christian religion for their subject are resolvable into a principle which Christianity certainly did not plant and which Christianity could not universally condemn because it is not universally wrong which principle is no other than this that they who are in possession of power do what they can to keep it Christianity is answerable for no part of the mischief which has been brought upon the world by persecution except that which has arisen from  conscientious  persecutors Now these perhaps have never been either numerous or powerful Nor is it to Christianity that even  their  mistake can fairly be imputed They have been misled by an error not properly Christian or religious but by an error in their moral philosophy They pursued the particular without adverting to the general consequence Believing certain articles of faith or a certain mode of worship to be highly conducive or perhaps essential to salvation they thought themselves bound to bring all they could by every means into them And this they thought without  considering what would be the effect of such a conclusion when adopted amongst mankind as a general rule of conduct Had there been in the New Testament what there are in the Koran precepts authorizing coercion in the propagation of the religion and the use of violence towards unbelievers the case would have been different This distinction could not have been taken or this defence made  I apologize for no species nor degree of persecution but I think that even the fact has been exaggerated The slave trade destroys more in a year than the inquisition does in a hundred or perhaps hath done since its foundation  If it be objected as I apprehend it will be that Christianity is chargeable with every mischief of which it has been the  occasion  though not the motive I answer that if the malevolent passions be there the world will never want occasions The noxious element will always sind a conductor Any  point will produce an explosion Did the applauded intercommunity of the Pagan theology preserve the peace of the Roman world Did it prevent oppressions proscriptions massacres devastations Was it bigotry that carried Alexander into the East or brought Caesar into Gaul Are the nations of the world into which Christianity hath not found its way or from which it hath been banished free from contentions Are their contentions less ruinous and sanguinary Is it owing to Christianity or to the want of it that the finest regions of the East the countries  inter quatuor maria  the peninsula of Greece together with a great part of the Mediteranean coast are at this day a desart or that the banks of the Nile whose constantly renewed fertility is not to be impaired by neglect or destroyed by the ravages of war serve only for the scene of a ferocious anarchy or the supply of unceasing hostilities Europe itself has known no religious wars for some centuries yet has hardly ever been without war Are the calamities which at this day afflict  it to be imputed to Christianity Hath Poland fallen by a Christian crusade Hath the overthrow in France of civil order and security been effected by the votaries of our religion or by the foes Amongst the awful lessons which the crimes and the miseries of that country afford to mankind this is one that in order to be a persecutor it is not necessary to be a bigot that in rage and cruelty in mischief and destruction fanaticism itself can be outdone by infidelity  Finally if war as it is now carried on between nations produce less misery and ruin than formerly we are indebted perhaps to Christianity for the change more than to any other cause Viewed therefore even in its relation to this subject it appears to have been of advantage to the world It hath humanised the conduct of wars it hath ceased to excite them  The differences of opinion that have in all ages prevailed amongst Christians fall  very much within the alternative which has been stated If we possessed the disposition which Christianity labours above all other qualities to inculcate these differences would do little harm If that disposition be wanting other causes even were these absent would continually rise up to call forth the malevolent passions into action Differences of opinion when accompanied with mutual charity which Christianity forbids them to violate are for the most part innocent and for some purposes useful They promote enquiry discussion and knowledge They help to keep up an attention to religious subjects and a concern about them which might be apt to die away in the calm and silence of universal agreement I do not know that it is in any degree true that the influence of religion is the greatest where there are the fewest dissenters  CHAP VIII The Conclusion  IN religion as in every other subject of human reasoning much depends upon the  order  in which we dispose our enquiries A man who takes up a system of divinity with a previous opinion that either every part must be true or the whole false approaches the discussion with great disadvantage No other system which is founded upon moral evidence would bear to be treated in the same manner Nevertheless in a certain degree we are all introduced to our religious studies under this prejudication And it cannot be avoided The weakness of the human judgment in the early part of youth yet its extreme susceptibility of impression renders it necessary to furnish it with some opinions and with some principles or other Or indeed without much  express care or much endeavour for this purpose the tendency of the mind of man to assimilate itself to the habits of thinking and speaking which prevail around him produces the same effect That indifferency and suspense that waiting and equilibrium of the judgment which some require in religious matters and which some would wish to be aimed at in the conduct of education are impossible to be preserved They are not given to the condition of human life  It is a consequence of this situation that the doctrines of religion come to us before the proofs and come to us with that mixture of explications and inferences from which no public creed is or can be free And the effect which too frequently follows from Christianity being presented to the understanding in this form is that when any articles which appear as parts of it contradict the apprehension of the persons to whom it is proposed men of rash and confident tempers hastily and indiscriminately reject the whole But is this to do justice  either to themselves or to the religion The rational way of treating a subject of such acknowledged importance is to attend in the first place to the general and substantial truth of its principles and to that alone When we once feel a foundation when we once perceive a ground of credibility in its history we shall proceed with safety to enquire into the interpretation of its records and into the doctrines which have been deduced from them Nor will it either endanger our faith or diminish or alter our motives for obedience if we should discover that these conclusions are formed with very different degrees of probability and possess very different degrees of importance  This conduct of the understanding dictated by every rule of right reasoning will uphold personal Christianity even in those countries in which it is established under forms the most liable to difficulty and objection It will also have the further effect of guarding us against the prejudices which are wont to arise in our minds to the disadvantage  of religion from observing the numerous controversies which are carried on amongst its professors and likewise of inducing a spirit of lenity and moderation in our judgment as well as in our treatment of those who stand in such controversies upon sides opposite to ours What is clear in Christianity we shall find to be sufficient and to be infinitely valuable what is dubious unnecessary to be decided or of very subordinate importance and what is most obscure will teach us to bear with the opinions which others may have formed upon the same subject We shall say to those who the most widely dissent from us what Augustine said to the worst heretics of his age "Illi in vos saeviant qui nesciunt cum quo labore verum inveniatur et quam difficile caveantur erroresqui nesciunt cum quantâ difficultate sanetur oculus interioris hominisqui nesciunt quibus suspiriis et gemitibus fiat ut ex quantulacunque parte possit intelligi Deus  Aug contr Ep Fund cap ii n  "  A judgment moreover which is once pretty well satisfied of the general truth of the religion will not only thus discriminate in its doctrines but will possess sufficient strength to overcome the reluctance of the imagination to admit articles of faith which are attended with difficulty of apprehension if such articles of faith appear to be truly parts of the revelation It was to be expected beforehand that what related to the oeconomy and to the persons of the invisible world which revelation professes to do and which if true it actually does should contain some points remote from our analogies and from the comprehension of a mind which hath acquired all its ideas from sense and from experience  It hath been my care in the preceding work to preserve the separation between evidences and doctrines as inviolable as I could to remove from the primary question all considerations which have been unnecessarily joined with it and to offer a defence of Christianity which every Christian  might read without seeing the tenets in which he had been brought up attacked or decried and it always afforded a satisfaction to my mind to observe that this was practicable that few or none of our many controversies with one another affect or relate to the proofs of our religion that the rent never descends to the foundation  The truth of Christianity depends upon its leading facts and upon them alone Now of these we have evidence which ought to satisfy us at least until it appear that mankind have ever been deceived by the same We have some uncontested and incontestible points to which the history of the human species hath nothing similar to offer A Jewish peasant changed the religion of the world and that without force without power without support without one natural source or circumstance of attraction influence or success Such a thing hath not happened in any other instance The companions of this person after he himself had been put to death for his attempt asserted  his supernatural character founded upon his supernatural operations and in testimony of the truth of their assertions  i e  in consequence of their own belief of that truth and in order to communicate the knowledge of it to others voluntarily entered upon lives of toil and hardship and with a full experience of their danger committed themselves to the last extremities of persecution This hath not a parallel More particularly a very few days after this person had been publicly executed and in the very city in which he was buried these his companions declared with one voice that his body was restored to life that they had seen him handled him eat with him conversed with him and in pursuance of their persuasion of the truth of what they told preached his religion with this strange fact as the foundation of it in the face of those who had killed him who were armed with the power of the country and necessarily and naturally disposed to treat his followers as they had treated himself and having done this upon the spot where the event took  place carried the intelligence of it abroad in despite of difficulties and opposition and where the nature of their errand gave them nothing to expect but derision insult and outrage This is without example These three facts I think are certain and would have been nearly so if the Gospels had never been written The Christian story as to these points hath never varied No other hath been set up against it Every letter every discourse every controversy amongst the followers of the religion every book written by them from the age of its commencement to the present time in every part of the world in which it hath been professed and with every sect into which it hath been divided and we have letters and discourses written by contemporaries by witnesses of the transaction by persons themselves bearing a share in it and other writings following that age in regular succession  concur  in representing these facts in this manner A religion which now possesses the greatest part of the civilised world unquestionably sprang up at Jerusalem at this time Some account  must be given of its origin some cause assigned for its rise All the accounts of this origin all the explications of this cause whether taken from the writings of the early followers of the religion in which and in which perhaps alone it could be expected that they should be distinctly unfolded or from occasional notices in other writings of that or the adjoining age either expressly alledge the facts above stated as the means by which the religion was set up or advert to its commencement in a manner which agrees with the supposition of these facts being true and which testifies their operation and effects  These propositions alone lay a foundation for our faith for they prove the existence of a transaction which cannot even in its most  general  parts be accounted for upon any reasonable supposition except that of the truth of the mission But the particulars the  detail  of the miracles or miraculous pretences for such there necessarily must have been upon which this unexampled transaction  rested and  for  which these men acted and suffered as they did act and suffer it is undoubtedly of great importance to us to know We  have  this detail from the fountain head from the persons themselves in accounts written by eyewitnesses of the scene by contemporaries and companions of those who were so not in one book but four each containing enough for the verification of the religion all agreeing in the fundamental parts of the history We have the authenticity of these books established by more and stronger proofs than belong to almost any other ancient book whatever and by proofs which widely distinguish them from any others claiming a similar authority to theirs If there were any good reason for doubt concerning the names to which these books are ascribed which there is not for they were never ascribed to any other and we have evidence not long after their publication of their bearing the names which they now bear their antiquity of which there is no question their reputation and authority amongst the early disciples of  the religion of which there is as little form a valid proof that they must in the main at least have agreed with what the first teachers of the religion delivered  When we open these ancient volumes we discover in them marks of truth whether we consider each in itself or collate them with one another The writers certainly knew something of what they were writing about for they manifest an acquaintance with local circumstances with the history and usages of the times which could only belong to an inhabitant of that country living in that age In every narrative we perceive simplicity and undesignedness the air and the language of reality When we compare the different narratives together we find them so varying as to repel all suspicion of confederacy so agreeing under this variety as to shew that the accounts had one real transaction for their common foundation often attributing different actions and discourses to the person whose history or rather memoirs of whose history they profess to relate yet  actions and discourses so similar as very much to bespeak the same character which is a coincidence that in such writers as they were could only be the consequence of their writing from fact and not from imagination  These four narratives are confined to the history of the founder of the religion and end with  his  ministry Since however it is certain that the affair went on we cannot help being anxious to know  how  it proceeded This intelligence hath come down to us in a work purporting to be written by a person himself connected with the business during the first stages of its progress taking up the story where the former histories had left it carrying on the narrative oftentimes with great particularity and throughout with the appearance of good sense  See Peter's speech upon curing the cripple Acts iii the council of the apostles xv Paul's discourse at Athens xvii before Agrippa xxvi I notice these passages both as fraught with good sense and as free from the smallest tincture of enthusiasm  information and candour stating  all along the origin and the only probable origin of effects which unquestionably were produced together with the natural consequences of situations which unquestionably did exist and  confirmed  in the substance at least of the account by the strongest possible accession of testimony which a history can receive  original letters  written by the person who is the principal subject of the history written upon the business to which the history relates and during the period or soon after the period which the history comprises No man can say that this altogether is not a body of strong historical evidence  When we reflect that some of those from whom the books proceeded are related to have themselves wrought miracles to have been the subject of miracles or of supernatural assistance in propagating the religion we may perhaps be led to think that more credit or a different kind of credit is due to these accounts than what can be claimed by merely human testimony But this is an  argument which cannot be addressed to sceptics or unbelievers A man must be a Christian before he can receive it The inspiration of the historical scriptures the nature degree and extent of that inspiration are questions undoubtedly of serious discussion but they are questions amongst Christians themselves and not between them and others The doctrine itself is by no means necessary to the belief of Christianity which must in the first instance at least depend upon the ordinary maxims of historical credibility  See Powell's Discourses Disc xv p    In viewing the detail of miracles recorded in these books we find every supposition negatived by which they can be resolved into fraud or delusion They were not secret nor momentary nor tentative nor ambiguous nor performed under the sanction of authority with the spectators on their side or in affirmance of tenets and practices already established We find also  the evidence alledged for them and which evidence was by great numbers received different from that upon which other miraculous accounts rest It was contemporary it was published upon the spot it continued it involved interests and questions of the greatest magnitude it contradicted the most fixed persuasions and prejudices of the persons to whom it was addressed it required from those who accepted it not a simple indolent assent but a change from thenceforward of principles and conduct a fubmission to consequences the most serious and the most deterring to loss and danger to insult outrage and persecution How such a story should be false or if false how under such circumstances it should make its way I think impossible to be explained yet such the Christian story was such were the circumstances under which it came forth and in opposition to such difficulties did it prevail  An event so connected with the religion and with the fortunes of the Jewish people  as one of their race one born amongst them establishing his authority and his law throughout a great portion of the civilized world it was perhaps to be expected should be noticed in the prophetic writings of that nation especially when this person together with his own mission caused also to be acknowledged the divine original of their institution and by those who before had altogether rejected it Accordingly we perceive in these writings various intimations  concurring  in the person and history of Jesus in a manner and in a degree in which passages taken from these books could not be made to concur in any person arbitrarily assumed or in any person except him who has been the author of great changes in the affairs and opinions of mankind Of some of these predictions the weight depends a good deal upon the concurrence Others possess great separate strength one in particular does this in an eminent degree It is an entire description manifestly directed to one character and to one scene of things it is extant in a writing or collection of  writings declaredly prophetic and it applies to Christ's character and to the circumstances of his life and death with considerable precision and in a way which no diversity of interpretation hath in my opinion been able to confound That the advent of Christ and the consequences of it should not have been more distinctly revealed in the Jewish sacred books is I think in some measure accounted for by the consideration that for the Jews to have foreseen the fall of their institution and that it was to merge at length into a more perfect and comprehensive dispensation would have cooled too much and relaxed their zeal for it and their adherence to it upon which zeal and adherence the preservation in the world of any remains for many ages of religious truth might in a great measure depend  Of what a revelation discloses to mankind one and only one question can properly be asked "Was it of importance to mankind to know or to be better assured  of" In this question when we turn our thoughts to the great Christian doctrine of the resurrection of the dead and of a future judgment no doubt can possibly be entertained He who gives me riches or honours does nothing he who even gives me health does little in comparison with that which lays before me just grounds for expecting a restoration to life and a day of account and retribution which thing Christianity hath done for millions  Other articles of the Christian faith although of infinite importance when placed beside any other topic of human enquiry are only the adjuncts and circumstances of this They are however such as appear worthy of the original to which we ascribe them The morality of the religion whether taken from the precepts or the example of its founder or from the lessons of its primitive teachers derived as it should seem from what had been inculcated by their master is in all its parts wise and pure neither adapted to vulgar prejudices  nor flattering popular notions nor excusing established practices but calculated in the matter of its instruction truly to promote human happiness and in the form in which it was conveyed to produce impression and effect a morality which let it have proceeded from any person whatever would have been satisfactory evidence of his good sense and integrity of the soundness of his understanding and the probity of his designs a morality in every view of it much more perfect than could have been expected from the natural circumstances and character of the person who delivered it a morality in a word which is and hath been most beneficial to mankind  Upon the greatest therefore of all possible occasions and for a purpose of inestimable value it pleased the Deity to vouchsafe a miraculous attestation Having done this for the institution when this alone could fix its authority or give to it a beginning he committed its future progress to the natural means of human communication and to the  influence of those causes by which human conduct and human affairs are governed The seed being sown was left to vegetate the leaven being inserted was left to ferment and both according to the laws of nature laws nevertheless disposed and controlled by that Providence which conducts the affairs of the universe though by an influence inscrutable and generally undistinguishable by us And in this Christianity is analogous to most other provisions for happiness The provision is made and being made is left to act according to laws which forming part of a more general system regulate this particular subject in common with many others  LET the constant recurrence to our observation of contrivance design and wisdom in the works of nature once fix upon our minds the belief of a God and after that all is easy In the councils of a Being possessed of the power and disposition which the Creator of the universe must possess it is not improbable that there should be a  future state it is not improbable that we should be acquainted with it A future state rectifies every thing because if moral agents be made in the last event happy or miserable according to their conduct in the station and under the circumstances in which they are placed it seems not very material by the operation of what causes according to what rules or even if you please to call it so by what chance or caprice these stations are assigned or these circumstances determined This hypothesis therefore solves all that objection to the divine care and goodness which the promiscuous distribution of good and evil I do not mean in the doubtful advantages of riches and grandeur but in the unquestionably important distinctions of health and sickness strength and infirmity bodily ease and pain mental alacrity and depression is apt on so many occasions to create This one truth changes the nature of things gives order to confusion makes the moral world of a piece with the natural  Nevertheless a higher degree of assurance than that to which it is possible to advance this or any argument drawn from the light of nature was necessary especially to overcome the shock which the imagination and the senses receive from the effects and the appearances of death and the obstruction which from thence arises to the expectation of either a continued or a future existence This difficulty although of a nature no doubt to act very forcibly will be found I think upon reflection to reside more in our habits of apprehension than in the subject and that the giving way to it when we have any reasonable grounds for the contrary is rather an indulging of the imagination than any thing else Abstractedly considered that is considered without relation to the difference which habit and merely habit produces in our faculties and modes of apprehension I do not see any thing more in the resurrection of a dead man than in the conception of a child except it be this that the one comes into his world with a system of prior consciousnesses  about him which the other does not and no person will say that he knows enough of either subject to perceive that this circumstance makes such a difference in the two cases that the one should be easy and the other impossible the one natural the other not so To the first man the succession of the species would be as incomprehensible as the resurrection of the dead is to us  Thought is different from motion perception from impact the individuality of a mind is hardly consistent with the divisibility of an extended substance or its volition that is its power of originating motion with the inertness which cleaves to every portion of matter which our observation or our experiments can reach These distinctions lead us to an  immaterial  principle at least they do this they so negative the mechanical properties of matter in the constitution of a sentient still more of a rational being that no argument drawn from these properties can be of any great  weight in opposition to other reasons when the question respects the changes of which such a nature is capable or the manner in which these changes are effected Whatever thought be or whatever it depend upon the regular experience of  sleep  makes one thing concerning it certain that it can be completely suspended and completely restored  If any one find it too great a strain upon his thoughts to admit the notion of a substance strictly immaterial that is from which extension and solidity are excluded he can find no difficulty in allowing that a particle as small as a particle of light minuter than all conceiveable dimensions may just as easily be the depositary the organ and the vehicle of consciousness as the congeries of animal substance which forms a human body or the human brain that being so it may transfer a proper identity to whatever shall hereafter be united to it may be safe amidst the destruction of its integuments may connect the natural with the spiritual  the corruptible with the glorified body If it be said that the mode and means of all this is imperceptible by our senses it is only what is true of the most important agencies and operations The great powers of nature are all invisible Gravitation electricity magnetism though constantly present and constantly exerting their influence though within us near us and about us though diffused throughout all space overspreading the surface or penetrating the contexture of all bodies with which we are acquainted depend upon substances and actions which are totally concealed from our senses The Supreme Intelligence is so himself  But whether these or any other attempts to satisfy the imagination bear any resemblance to the truth or whether the imagination which as I have said before is the mere slave of habit  can  be satisfied or not when a future state and the revelation of a future state is not only perfectly consistent with the attributes of the Being who governs  the universe but when it is more when it alone removes the appearances of contrariety which attend the operations of his will towards creatures capable of comparative merit and demerit of reward and punishment when a strong body of historical evidence confirmed by many internal tokens of truth and authenticity gives us just reason to believe that such a revelation hath actually been made we ought to set our minds at rest with the assurance that in the resources of creative wisdom expedients cannot be wanted to carry into effect what the Deity hath purposed that either a new and mighty influence will descend upon the human world to resuscitate extinguished consciousness or that amidst the other wonderful contrivances with which the universe abounds and by some of which we see animal life in many instances assuming improved forms of existence acquiring new organs new perceptions and new sources of enjoyment provision is also made though by methods secret to us as all the great processes of nature are for conducting the  objects of God's moral government through the necessary changes of their frame to those final distinctions of happiness and misery which he hath declared to be reserved for obedience and transgression for virtue and vice for the use and the neglect the right and the wrong employment of the faculties and opportunities with which he hath been pleased severally to entrust and to try us  THE END
