 THE FANCID  AN HEROIC POEM In SIX CANTOS  To His GRACE the Duke of  MARLBOROUGH  ON THE TURN of His GENIUS to ARMS  Up Sword and know thou a more proper Time  HAMLET  LONDON  Printed for J OSBORN at the  Golden Bail  in  Paternoster Row  MDCCXLIII  THE PREFACE  IT will be easily perceiv'd why no Address by way of  Dedication  cou'd be proper to this Poem Yet the Verses ought perhaps to have been offer'd before printed to the View of One Great Family lest among Ideas of so complicated a Variety there shou'd be some wherewith it might not as to Point of Delicacy have been found eligible to associate Names of such sincere Distinction and Importance But the Writer recollected that the mere Omission of an Act of Ceremony cou'd not equitably be complain'd of in a Poem where he has not arrogated  to Himself  the Freedom to give PRAISE or CENSURE All that points at either One or Other being narrative Recital only and That too from the Voices of such Speakers as the Public daily  hears  expressing  more upon both Subjects than they are represented in this Place as uttering  As to the general Disposition of the Purpose if Any too bold Strokes of Liberty shou'd chance to be suspected in it let it be remember'd in the Writer's Favour that he is no better than an empty  Visionary  And This is not the first Time that a Man in a Dream has been a very  impertinent Fellow  who in his waking Intervals has kept within the Bounds of due  Decorum  Concerning LUXURY especially none ought to make the Muse accountable for what she prattles in her  Sleep  Since 'tis about a Power she never corresponds with  but in Slumber  And if TRADE is touchy and won't bear to have it credited that  Daughters  come by means of  Mothers  who could shun the Hazard of offending such a choleric PetulanceThe Writer had no Licence to restrain or castrate Sentiments he but  reports  from Personages to whome his Country owes a Reverence that forbids the Boldness of curtailing their IdeasNeither has he given the captious  Coquette  abovenam'd  the least Occasion of Offence without Hardstraining and Partiality for Who can look upon it as an Undervaluing of  Trade  that she is represented as not overmuch dispos'd to  carry Arms  Herself nor overfond indeed of Those  she pays for carrying them  Authorities enough might probably be found to prove plain Truth no Slander But he rather pleads the Merit of that prophesied  Expedient  toward the End of the Vth Canto for a perfect Reconciliation between the Drum and WarehouseIf notwithstanding This the waking Poet must be charg'd with the Vagaries of his dreaming Muse He can but borrow Comfort from this titfortat ReflectionThat since Trade is naturally dispos'd to think with Dulness and Contempt of  Poetry  the Poet in his Turn may by Right of Equivalent assume the same dull Privilege and prate as foolishly of  Traffick  To pass at once from Poetryto Prose and Truth and serious  History  The great and noblyjudging Lady to whome in the VIth Canto an Advice of no small Consequence  is offer'd by a bold tho'  naked  Friend of whome she never yet was known to be asham'd however bare and out of Fashion she approach'd her will reflect with some Attention on the Proposition after hearing what  Foundation  It was grounded on  About the Year a private Person not worth  naming  but an ardent Lover of his Country's Reputation became difpossess'd of a mistaken Notion which had been at first imbib'd by Conversation with the  Prejudic'd  but gradually confirm'd and heighten'd by much Reading Speculation and Reflection upon military Subjects that the most celebrated  English Conqueror  of this last Age It might I think be added without Flattery above Any of the Former was not  premeditatively  and by Force of his superior Skill the Author of his own unprecedented VictoriesThe Mistaker grounded his Conclusion on that Great General's  Letters  written from the Fields of Battle with the first Accounts of his SuccessesIt is visible beyond Dispute that  there  one meets  with none of those  descriptive  and  explanatory  Circumstances whereby the skilful Captains of all Ages took such cautionary Care to guard against unjust Impressions of their Conduct by unfolding it in Plan in Progress and Accomplishment that not their  Fortune  only but their Foresight and Superiority of Genius might be noted in their Victories It is hence that in so many of the Antient's and in some great  Modern's  written Narratives we  see  and understand minutely the whole Groundplots Dispositions Oppositions and clear  Outbreak  of the Actions Not in their bald  Success  alone but with their previous Motives their impending Agitations and eventual Overbalance and Conclusion Whereas from all the publish'd Letters of our more than equal Executer of his own unequall'd Purposes we gather nothing further than that the Army He commanded was triumphant and that He seems to think each Leader in it more deserving his Remark than the Elucidation of his own Designs in their reported Execution  In a Visit made about the Time just mention'd to another  English  General a Noble Lord since dead at a small Garden Seat of his near  London  These Observations were inlarg'd upon as they had often been to others in a Conversation on the military Character of our great Favourite of Fortune whome it has been thought the Lord here meant had formerly regarded with some Rival Pangs of Emulation It were therefore an ungenerous Coldness to his Memory to conceal the noble Sentiments wherewith he clos'd the Conversation on this Subject  "You have said he misunderstood His Character and done it the same  Wrong  that many Thousands do and will continue to do from but the natural Consequence of his sincere and modest  Negligence of Ostentation  He thought it equally His Duty to subdue the Enemy and His own Sensibility of  Triumph for subduing him  He made I think but  one  Mistake in his Field Conduct But  That  was a Mistake of such unlucky Consequence that It has been able to  do more  against Himself  than Ten  French Armies  cou'd for It obscures you see the Lustre of his GeniusHe trusted  History  for Explanations which He shou'd have known It cou'd not make but in a lame and superficial manner for want of Lights which He alone had Power to furnish who was the only Person disinclinable to  wish  'em furnish'd"  The Impression which this truly noble Answer made and the Reflections which It gave Occasion to have often  since  presented to Imagination as a  National  Misfortune the Possibility of some destructive Accident to those invaluable Original Papers which contain 'tis said sufficient Matter in His Family's Possession to immortalize as well That Great Man's  Temper Wisdom Suavity Skill  MODES and MEANS of Conquest as the Reputation merely of the Victories themselvesThe  Last  it must be own'd is  Glory  But it is a Glory of a barren and unpropagative Species 'Tis the Glory of a  Nimrod  a  Sesostris Hercules Arthur  and  Pendragon  Names of aweful Cloudinessl but uneffectual  Admirationbecause heard of more than  shown  Not Lights of Living  History  by whose Help the  Caesars  and the  Alexanders  are not only in Themselves immortal but by their Force of Emulative Inspiration have been are and will continue to the End of Time the military  Fathers  of new Sons of Glory in all Nations and throughout all Ages  Who therefore cou'd too much lament an Accident of such severe Importance shou'd it happen to the mention'd Papers before That glorious  Use  has been drawn from them which is hinted in the Close of the last Canto Where that the Writer may not seem impertinent he has here assign'd his  Reasons  for conceiving it both a Domestic and a Public Duty on the Care of That illustrious Conqueror's  Representatives  But where the Hand is to be found in all Points equal to an Undertaking of such arduous Difficulty is a Wish that may be added to the List of
