 AN EPISTLE TO WILLIAM HOGARTH  Price Two Shillings and Sixpence  AN EPISTLE TO WILLIAM HOGARTH  By C CHURCHILL  Ut Pictura Poesis  HOR  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR And sold by J COOTE at the KING's ARMS in PATERNOSTERROW MDCCLXIII  AN EPISTLE TO William Hogarth  _AMongst the sons of men how few are known  Who dare be just to merit not their own  Superior virtue and superior sense  To knaves and fools will always give offence  Nay men of real worth can scarcely bear  So nice is Jealousy a rival there  BE wicked as thou wilt do all that's base  Proclaim thyself the monster of thy race  Let Vice and Folly thy black Soul divide  Be proud with meanness and be mean with pride  Deaf to the voice of Faith and Honour fall  From side to side yet be of none at all  Spurn all those charities those sacred ties  Which Nature in her bounty good as wise  To work our safety and ensure her plan  Contriv'd to bind and rivet man to man  Lift against Virtue Pow'r's oppressive rod  Betray thy Country and deny thy God  And in one gen'ral comprehensive line  To group which volumes scarcely could define  Whate'er of Sin and Dulness can be said  Join to a F's heart a D's head  Yet may'st thou pass unnotic'd in the throng  And free from Envy safely sneak along  The rigid Saint by whom no mercy's shewn  To Saints whose lives are better than his own  Shall spare thy crimes and WIT who never once  Forgave a Brother shall forgive a Dunce  BUT should thy soul form'd in some luckless hour  Vile Int'rest scorn nor madly grasp at Pow'r  Should Love of Fame in ev'ry noble mind  A brave disease with love of Virtue join'd  Spur thee to deeds of pith where Courage tried  In Reason's court is amply justified  Or fond of knowledge and averse to strife  Should'st Thou prefer the calmer walk of life  Should'st Thou by pale and sickly STUDY led  Pursue coy Science to the Fountain head  Virtue thy guide and Public Good thy end  Should ev'ry thought to our improvement tend  To curb the passions to enlarge the mind  Purge the sick weal and humanize mankind  Rage in her eye and Malice in her breast  Redoubled Horror grinning on her crest  Fiercer each snake and sharper ev'ry dart  Quick from her cell shall madd'ning ENVY start  Then shalt Thou find but find alas too late  How vain is worth how short is Glory's date  Then shalt Thou find whilst Friends with Foes conspire  To give more proof than Virtue would desire  Thy danger chiefly lies in acting well  No crime's so great as daring to excell  WHILST SATIRE thus disdaining mean controul  Urg'd the free dictates of an honest soul  CANDOUR who with the charity of  Paul    Still thinks the best whene'er she thinks at all  With the sweet milk of human kindness bless'd  The furious ardour of my zeal repress'd  CANS'T Thou with more than usual warmth she cry'd  Thy malice to indulge and feed thy pride  Can'st Thou severe by Nature as Thou art  With all that wond'rous rancour in thy heart  Delight to torture Truth ten thousand ways  To spin detraction forth from themes of praise  To make VICE sit for purposes of strife  And draw the Hag much larger than the life  To make the good seem bad the bad seem worse  And represent our Nature as our curse  DOTH not humanity condemn that zeal  Which tends to aggravate and not to heal  Doth not discretion warn thee of disgrace  And danger grinning stare thee in the face  Loud as the Drum which spreading terrour round  From emptiness acquires the pow'r of sound  Doth not the voice of NORTON strike thy ear  And the pale MANSFIELD chill thy soul with fear  Do'st Thou fond man believe thyself secure  Because Thou'rt honest and because Thou'rt poor  Do'st Thou on Law and Liberty depend  Turn turn thy eyes and view thy injur'd friend  Art Thou beyond the ruffian gripe of Pow'r  When WILKES  prejudg'd  is sentenc'd to the Tow'r  Do'st Thou by Privilege exemption claim  When Privilege is little more than name  Or to Prerogative that glorious ground  On which Statescoundrels oft have safety found  Dost Thou pretend and there a sanction find  Unpunish'd thus to Libel human kind  WHEN Poverty the Poet's constant crime  Compell'd thee all unfit to trade in rime  Had not Romantic notions turn'd thy head  Had'st Thou not valued Honour more than bread  Had Int'rest pliant Int'rest been thy guide  And had not Prudence been debauch'd by Pride  In flatt'ry's stream Thou would'st have dipp'd thy pen  Applied to great and not to honest men  Nor should Conviction have seduc'd thy heart  To take the weaker tho' the better part  WHAT but rank Folly for thy curse decreed  Could into SATIRE's barren path mislead  When open to thy view before thee lay  Soulsoothing PANEGYRIC's flow'ry way  There might the Muse have saunter'd at her ease  And pleasing others learn'd herself to please  Lords  should have listen'd to the sugar'd treat  And  Ladies  simp'ring own'd it vastly sweet  Rogues  in thy prudent verse with virtue grac'd  Fools  mark'd by thee as prodigies of Taste  Must have forbid pouring preferments down  Such Wit such Truth as thine to quit the gown  Thy sacred Brethren too for they no less  Than Laymen bring their off'rings to Success  Had hail'd Thee good if great and paid the vow  Sincere as that they pay to God whilst Thou  In  Lawn  hadst whisper'd to a sleeping croud  As dull as R and half as proud  PEACE CANDOURwisely had'st thou said and well  Could Int'rest in this breast one moment dwell  Could she with prospect of success oppose  The firm resolves which from Conviction rose  I cannot truckle to a Fool of State  Nor take a favour from the man I hate  Free leave have others by such means to shine  I scorn their practice they may laugh at mine  BUT in this charge forgetful of thyself  Thou hast assum'd the maxims of that Elf  Whom God in wrath for man's dishonour fram'd  CUNNING in Heav'n amongst us PRUDENCE nam'd  That  servile  PRUDENCE which I leave to those  Who dare not be my Friends can't be my Foes  HAD I with cruel and oppressive rimes  Pursued and turn'd misfortunes into crimes  Had I when Virtue gasping lay and low  Join'd tyrant Vice and added woe to woe  Had I made Modesty in blushes speak  And drawn the tear down Beauty's sacred cheek  Had I damn'd then in thought debas'd my lays  To wound that Sex which Honour bids me praise  Had I from vengeance by base views betray'd  In endless night sunk injur'd AYLIFF's shade  Had I which Satirists of mighty name  Renown'd in rime rever'd for  moral  fame  Have done before whom Justice shall pursue  In future verse brought forth to public view  A Noble Friend and made his foibles known  Because his worth was greater than my own  Had I spar'd those so  Prudence  had decreed  Whom God so help me at my greatest need  I ne'er will spare those vipers to their King  Who smooth their looks and flatter whilst they sting  Or had I not taught patriot zeal to boast  Of Those who flatter least but love him most  Had I thus sinn'd my stubborn soul should bend  At CANDOUR's voice and take as from a friend  The deep rebuke Myself should be the first  To hate myself and stamp my Muse accurs'd  BUT shall my armforbid it manly Pride  Forbid it Reason warring on my side  For vengeance lifted high the stroke forbear  And hang suspended in the desart air  Or to my trembling side unnerv'd sink down  Palsied forsooth by CANDOUR's halfmade frown  When Justice bids me on shall I delay  Because insipid CANDOUR bars my way  When she of all alike the puling friend  Would disappoint my Satire's noblest end  When she to villains would a sanction give  And shelter those who are not fit to live  When she would screen the guilty from a blush  And bids me spare whom Reason bids me crush  All leagues with CANDOUR proudly I resign  She cannot be for Honour's turn nor mine  YET come cold monitor half foe half friend  Whom Vice can't fear whom Virtue can't commend  Come CANDOUR by thy dull indiff'rence known  Thou equalblooded judge Thou lukewarm drone  Who fashion'd without feelings dost expect  We call that Virtue which we know Defect  Come and observe the Nature of our crimes  The gross and rank complexion of the times  Observe it well and then review my plan  Praise if you will or censure if you can  WHILST Vice presumptuous lords it as in sport  And Piety is only known at Court  Whilst wretched LIBERTY expiring lies  Beneath the fatal burthen of EXCISE  Whilst nobles act without one touch of shame  What men of humble rank would blush to name  Whilst Honour's plac'd in highest point of view  Worshipp'd by those who Justice never knew  Whilst Bubbles of Distinction waste in play  The hours of rest and blunder thro' the day  With dice and cards opprobrious vigils keep  Then turn to ruin empires in their sleep  Whilst Fathers by relentless passion led  Doom worthy injur'd sons to beg their bread  Merely with illgot illsav'd wealth to grace  An alien abject poor proud upstart race  Whilst MARTIN flatters only to betray  And WEBB gives up his dirty soul for pay  Whilst titles serve to hush a villain's fears  Whilst Peers are Agents made and Agents Peers  Whilst base betrayers are themselves betray'd  And makers ruin'd by the thing they made  Whilst C false to God and man for gold  Like the old traitor who a Saviour sold  To Shame his Master Friend and Father gives  Whilst BUTE remains in pow'r whilst HOLLAND lives  Can Satire want a subject where Disdain  By Virtue fir'd may point her sharpest strain  Where cloath'd with thunder Truth may roll along  And CANDOUR justify the rage of song  SUCH Things such Men before Thee such an Age  Where Rancour great as thine may glut her rage  And sicken e'en to surfeit where the pride  Of Satire pouring down in fullest tide  May spread wide vengeance round yet all the while  Justice behold the ruin with a smile  Whilst I thy foe misdeem'd cannot condemn  Nor disapprove that rage I wish to stem  Wilt thou degen'rate and corrupted chuse  To soil the credit of thy haughty Muse  With Fallacy most infamous to stain  Her Truth and render all her anger vain  When I beheld Thee incorrect but bold  A various comment on the Stage unfold  When Play'rs on Play'rs before thy satire fell  And poor Reviews conspir'd thy wrath to swell  When States and Statesmen next became thy care  And only kings were safe if thou wast there  Thy ev'ry word I weigh'd in Judgment's scale  And in thy ev'ry word found Truth prevail  Why do'st Thou now to Falshood meanly fly  Not even CANDOUR can forgive a lie  BAD as Men are why should thy frantic rimes  Traffick in Slander and invent new crimes  Crimes which existing only in thy mind  Weak Spleen brings forth to blacken all Mankind  By pleasing hopes we lure the human heart  To practise Virtue and improve in Art  To thwart these ends which proud of honest Fame  A noble Muse would cherish and inflame  Thy  Drudge  contrives and in our full career  Sicklies our hopes with the pale hue of Fear  Tells us that all our labours are in vain  That what we seek we never can obtain  That dead to Virtue lost to Nature's plan  ENVY possesses the whole race of man  That Worth is criminal and Danger lies  Danger extreme in being good and wise  'TIS a rank falshood search the world around  There cannot be so vile a monster found  Not one so vile on whom suspicions fall  Of that gross guilt which you impute to all  Approv'd by those who disobey her laws  Virtue from Vice itself extorts applause  Her very foes bear witness to her state  They will not love her but they cannot hate  Hate Virtue for herself with spite pursue  Merit for Merit's sake might this be true  I would renounce my Nature with disdain  And with the beasts that perish graze the plain  Might this be true had we so far fill'd up  The measure of our crimes and from the cup  Of guilt so deeply drank as not to find  Thirsting for sin one drop one dreg behind  Quick ruin must involve this flaming ball  And Providence in Justice crush us all  None but the damn'd and amongst them the worst  Those who for double guilt are doubly curs'd  Can be so lost nor can the worst of all  At once into such deep damnation fall  By painful slow degrees they reach this crime  Which e'en in Hell must be a work of time  Cease then thy guilty rage thou wayward son  With the foul gall of discontent o'er run  List to my voicebe honest if you can  Nor slander Nature in her fav'rite man  But if thy spirit resolute in ill  Once having err'd persists in error still  Go on at large no longer worth my care  And freely vent those blasphemies in air  Which I would stamp as false tho' on the tongue  Of Angels the injurious slander hung  DUP'D by thy vanity that cunning elf  Who snares the Coxcomb to deceive himself  Or blinded by thy rage did'st Thou believe  That We too coolly would ourselves deceive  That We as sterling falshood would admit  Because 'twas season'd with some little wit  When Fiction rises pleasing to the eye  Men will believe because they love the lie  But Truth herself if clouded with a frown  Must have some solemn proof to pass her down  Hast Thou maintaining that which must disgrace  And bring into contempt the human race  Hast Thou or can'st Thou in Truth's sacred court  To save thy credit and thy cause support  Produce one proof make out one real ground  On which so great so gross a charge to found  Nay dost Thou know one man let that appear  From wilful falshood I'll proclaim thee clear  One man so lost to Nature so untrue  From whom this gen'ral charge thy rashness drew  On this foundation shalt thou stand or fall  Prove that in One which you have charg'd on All  Reason determines and it must be done  'Mongst men or past or present name me One  HOGARTHI take thee CANDOUR at thy word  Accept thy proffer'd terms and will be heard  Thee have I heard with virulence declaim  Nothing retain'd of Candour but the name  By Thee have I been charg'd in angry strains  With that mean falshood which my soul disdains  HOGARTH stand forthNay hang not thus aloof  Now CANDOUR now Thou shall receive such proof  Such damning proof that henceforth Thou shalt fear  To tax my wrath and own my conduct clear  HOGARTH stand forthI dare thee to be tried  In that great Court where Conscience must preside  At that most solemn bar hold up thy hand  Think before whom on what account you stand  Speak but consider wellfrom first to last  Review thy life weigh ev'ry action past  Nay you shall have no reason to complain  Take longer time and view them o'er again  Canst Thou remember from thy earliest youth  And as thy God must judge Thee speak the truth  A single instance where  Self  laid aside  And Justice taking place of fear and pride  Thou with an equal eye did'st GENIUS view  And give to Merit what was Merit's due  Genius and Merit are a sure offence  And thy Soul sickens at the name of Sense  Is any one so foolish to succeed  On ENVY's altar he is doom'd to bleed  HOGARTH a guilty pleasure in his eyes  The place of Executioner supplies  See how he glotes enjoys the sacred feast  And proves himself by cruelty a priest  WHILST the weak Artist to thy whims a slave  Would bury all those pow'rs which Nature gave  Would suffer blank concealment to obscure  Those rays thy Jealousy could not endure  To feed thy vanity would rust unknown  And to secure thy credit blast his own  In HOGARTH he was sure to find a friend  He could not fear and therefore might commend  But when his Spirit rous'd by honest Shame  Shook off that Lethargy and soar'd to Fame  When with the pride of Man resolv'd and strong  He scorn'd those fears which did his Honour wrong  And on himself determin'd to rely  Brought forth his labours to the public eye  No Friend in Thee could such a Rebel know  He had desert and HOGARTH was his foe  SOULS of a tim'rous cast of petty name  In ENVY's court not yet quite dead to shame  May some remorse some qualms of Conscience feel  And suffer Honour to abate their Zeal  But the Man truly and compleatly great  Allows no rule of action but his hate  Thro' ev'ry bar he bravely breaks his way  Passion his Principle and Parts his prey  Mediums in Vice and Virtue speak a mind  Within the pale of Temperance confin'd  The daring Spirit scorns her narrow schemes  And good or bad is always in extremes  MAN's practice duly weigh'd thro' ev'ry age  On the same plan hath ENVY form'd her rage  'Gainst those whom Fortune hath our rivals made  In way of Science and in way of Trade  Stung with mean Jealousy she arms her spite  First works then views their ruin with delight  Our HOGARTH here a grand improver shines  And nobly on the gen'ral plan refines  He like himself o'erleaps the servile bound  Worth is his mark wherever Worth is found  Should Painters only his vast wrath suffice  Genius in ev'ry walk is Lawful Prize  'Tis a gross insult to his o'ergrown state  His love to merit is to feel his hate  WHEN WILKES our Countryman our common friend  Arose his King his Country to defend  When tools of pow'r he bar'd to public view  And from their holes the sneaking cowards drew  When Rancour found it far beyond her reach  To soil his honour and his truth impeach  What could induce Thee at a time and place  Where manly Foes had blush'd to shew their face  To make that effort which must damn thy name  And sink Thee deep deep in thy grave with shame  Did Virtue move Thee no 'twas Pride rank Pride  And if Thou had'st not done it Thou had'st dy'd  MALICE who disappointed of her end  Whether to work the bane of Foe or Friend  Preys on herself and driven to the Stake  Gives Virtue that revenge she scorns to take  Had kill'd Thee tott'ring on life's utmost verge  Had WILKES and LIBERTY escap'd thy scourge  WHEN that GREAT CHARTER which our Fathers bought  With their best blood was into question brought  When big with ruin o'er each English head  Vile Slav'ry hung suspended by a thread  When LIBERTY all trembling and aghast  Fear'd for the future knowing what was past  When ev'ry breast was chill'd with deep despair  Till Reason pointed out that PRATT was there  Lurking most Ruffianlike behind a screen  So plac'd all things to see himself unseen  VIRTUE with due contempt saw HOGARTH stand  The murd'rous pencil in his palsied hand  What was the cause of Liberty to him  Or what was Honour let them sink or swim  So he may gratify without controul  The mean resentments of his selfish soul  Let Freedom perish if to Freedom true  In the same ruin WILKES may perish too  WITH all the symptoms of assur'd decay  With age and sickness pinch'd and worn away  Pale quiv'ring lips lank cheeks and falt'ring tongue  The Spirits out of tune the Nerves unstrung  Thy Body shrivell'd up thy dim eyes funk  Within their sockets deep thy weak hams shrunk  The body's weight unable to sustain  The stream of life scarce trembling thro' the vein  More than halfkill'd by honest truths which fell  Thro' thy own fault from men who wish'd thee well  Can'st thou e'en thus thy thoughts to vengeance give  And dead to all things else to Malice live  Hence Dotard to thy closet shut thee in  By deep repentance wash away thy sin  From haunts of men to shame and sorrow fly  And on the verge of death learn how to die  VAIN exhortation wash the Ethiop white  Discharge the leopard's spots turn day to night  Controul the course of Nature bid the deep  Hush at thy Pygmy voice her waves to sleep  Perform things passing strange yet own thy art  Too weak to work a change in such a heart  That ENVY which was woven in the frame  At first will to the last remain the same  Reason may droop may die but Envy's rage  Improves by time and gathers strength from age  Some and not few vain triflers with the pen  Unread unpractis'd in the ways of men  Tell us that ENVY who with giant stride  Stalks thro' the vale of life by Virtue's side  Retreats when she hath drawn her latest breath  And calmly hears her praises after death  To such observers HOGARTH gives the lie  Worth may be hears'd but Envy cannot die  Within the mansion of his gloomy breast  A mansion suited well to such a guest  Immortal unimpair'd she rears her head  And damns alike the living and the dead  OFT have I known Thee HOGARTH weak and vain  Thyself the idol of thy aukward strain  Thro' the dull measure of a summer's day  In phrase most vile prate long long hours away  Whilst Friends with Friends all gaping sit and gaze  To hear a HOGARTH babble HOGARTH's praise  But if athwart thee Interruption came  And mention'd with respect some Ancient's name  Some Ancient's name who in the days of yore  The crown of Art with greatest honour wore  How have I seen thy coward cheek turn pale  And blank confusion seize thy mangled tale  How hath thy Jealousy to madness grown  And deem'd his praise injurious to thy own  Then without mercy did thy wrath make way  And Arts and Artists all became thy prey  Then did'st Thou trample on establish'd rules  And proudly levell'd all the antient schools  Condemn'd those works with praise thro' ages grac'd  Which you had never seen or could not taste  "But would mankind have true Perfection shewn  " It must be found in labours of my own  " I dare to challenge in one single piece  " Th' united force of ITALY and GREECE"  Thy eager hand the curtain then undrew  And brought the boasted Masterpiece to view  Spare thy remarkssay not a single word  The Picture seen why is the Painter heard  Call not up Shame and Anger in our cheeks  Without a Comment SIGISMUNDA speaks  POOR SIGISMUNDA what a Fate is thine  DRYDEN the great High Priest of all the Nine  Reviv'd thy name gave what a Muse could give  And in his Numbers bad thy Mem'ry live  Gave thee those soft sensations which might move  And warm the coldest Anchorite to Love  Gave thee that Virtue which could curb desire  Refine and Consecrate Love's headstrong fire  Gave thee those griefs which made the Stoic feel  And call'd compassion forth from hearts of steel  Gave thee that firmness which our Sex may shame  And made Man bow to Woman's juster claim  So that our tears which from Compassion flow  Seem to debase thy dignity of woe  But O how much unlike how fall'n how chang'd  How much from Nature and herself estrang'd  How totally depriv'd of all the pow'rs  To shew her feelings and awaken our's  Doth SIGISMUNDA now devoted stand  The helpless victim of a Dauber's hand  But why  my  HOGARTH such a progress made  So rare a Pattern for the SignPost trade  In the full force and whirlwind of thy pride  Why was  Heroic  Painting laid aside  Why is It not resum'd thy Friends at Court  Men all in place and pow'r crave thy support  Be grateful then for once and thro' thy field  Of Politics thy  Epic  Pencil wield  Maintain the cause which they good lack avow  And would maintain too but they know not how  Thro' ev'ry  Pannel  let thy Virtue tell  How BUTE prevail'd HOW PITT and TEMPLE fell  How ENGLAND's sons whom They conspir'd to bless  Against our Will with insolent success  Approve their fall and with addresses run  How got God knows to hail the SCOTTISH Sun  Point out our fame in war when vengeance hurl'd  From the strong arm of Justice shook the world  Thine and thy Country's honour to encrease  Point out the honours of succeeding Peace  Our  Moderation  Christianlike display  Shew what we got and what we gave away  In Colours dull and heavy as the tale  Let a  State  Chaos thro' the whole prevail  BUT of events regardless whilst the Muse  Perhaps with too much heat her theme pursues  While her quick Spirits rouze at FREEDOM's call  And ev'ry drop of blood is turn'd to gall  Whilst a dear Country and an injur'd Friend  Urge my strong anger to the bitt'rest end  Whilst honest trophies to revenge are rais'd  Let not One real Virtue pass unprais'd  Justice with equal course bids Satire flow  And loves the Virtue of her greatest foe  O that I here could that rare Virtue mean  Which scorns the rule of Envy Pride and Spleen  Which springs not from the labour'd Works of Art  But hath its rise from Nature in the heart  Which in itself with happiness is crown'd  And spreads with joy the blessing all around  But Truth forbids and in these simple lays  Contented with a diff'rent kind of Praise  Must HOGARTH stand that Praise which GENIUS gives  In Which to latest time the  Artist  lives  But not the  Man  which rightly understood  May make Us great but cannot make us good  That Praise be HOGARTH's freely let him wear  That Wreath which GENIUS wove and planted there  Foe as I am should Envy tear it down  Myself would labour to replace the Crown  IN walks of Humor in that cast of Style  Which probing to the quick yet makes us smile  In Comedy thy nat'ral road to fame  Nor let me call it by a meaner name  Where a beginning middle and an end  Are aptly joined where parts on parts depend  Each made for each as bodies for their soul  So as to form one true and perfect whole  Where a plain story to the eye is told  Which we conceive the moment we behold  HOGARTH unrivall'd stands and shall engage  Unrivall'd praise to the most distant age  How could'st Thou then to Shame perversely run  And tread that path which Nature bad Thee shun  Why did ambition overleap her rules  And thy vast parts become the sport of Fools  By diff'rent methods diff'rent Men excell  But where is He who can do all things well  Humour thy Province for some monstrous crime  Pride struck Thee with the frenzy of  Sublime    But when the work was finish'd could thy mind  So partial be and to herself so blind  What with contempt All view'd to view with awe  Nor see those faults which ev'ry Blockhead saw  Blush Thou vain Man and if desire of Fame  Founded on real Art thy thoughts inflame  To quick destruction SIGISMUNDA give  And let her mem'ry die that thine may live  BUT should fond Candour for her Mercy sake  With pity view and pardon this mistake  Or should Oblivion to thy wish most kind  Wipe off that stain nor leave one trace behind  Of ARTS  despis'd  of ARTISTS by thy frown  Aw'd from just hopes  of  rising Worth kept down    Of all thy meanness thro' this mortal race  Can'st Thou the living memory erase  Or shall not Vengeance follow to the grave  And give back just that measure which You gave  With so much merit and so much success  With so much pow'r to curse so much to bless  Would He have been Man's friend instead of foe  HOGARTH had been a little God below  Why then like savage Giants fam'd of old  Of whom in Scripture Story we are told  Dost Thou in cruelty that strength employ  Which Nature meant to save not to destroy  Why dost Thou all in horrid pomp array'd  Sit grinning o'er the ruins Thou hast made  Most rank Illnature must applaud thy art  But even Candour must condemn thy heart  FOR Me who warm and zealous for my Friend  In spite of railing thousands will commend  And no less warm and zealous 'gainst my foes  Spite of commending thousands will oppose  I dare thy worst with scorn behold thy rage  But with an eye of Pity view thy Age  Thy feeble Age in which as in a glass  We see how Men to dissolution pass  Thou  wretched Being  whom on Reason's plan  So chang'd so lost I cannot call a Man  What could persuade Thee at this time of life  To launch afresh into the Sea of Strife  Better for Thee scarce crawling on the earth  Almost as much a child as at thy birth  To have resign'd in peace thy parting breath  And sunk unnotic'd in the arms of Death  Why would thy grey grey hairs resentment brave  Thus to go down with sorrow to the grave  Now by my Soul it makes me blush to know  My Spirits could descend to such a foe  Whatever cause the vengeance might provoke  It seems rank Cowardice to give the stroke  SURE 'tis a curse which angry Fates impose  To mortify man's arrogance that Those  Who're fashion'd of some better sort of clay  Much sooner than the common herd decay  What bitter pangs must humbled GENIUS feel  In their last hours to view a SWIFT and STEELE  How must illboding horrors fill her breast  When She beholds Men mark'd above the rest  For qualities most dear plung'd from that height  And sunk deep sunk in second Childhood's night  Are Men indeed such things and are the best  More subject to this evil than the rest  To drivel out whole years of Ideot breath  And sit the Monuments of living Death  O galling circumstance to human pride  Abasing Thought but not to be denied  With curious Art the Brain too finely wrought  Preys on herself and is destroy'd by Thought  Constant Attention wears the active mind  Blots out her pow'rs and leaves a blank behind  But let not Youth to insolence allied  In heat of blood in full career of pride  Possess'd of GENIUS with unhallow'd rage  Mock the infirmities of rev'rend age  The greatest GENIUS to this Fate may bow  REYNOLDS in time may be like HOGARTH now  FINIS
