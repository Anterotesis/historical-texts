 THE COURT OF  ALEXANDER  An OPERA In TWO ACTS  THE COURT OF  ALEXANDER  An OPERA In TWO ACTS  As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  In Times of Old indeed when  TIME  was young  HOMER  the first of Bards his History sung  And every Poet since the  Iliad  chuses  For Want of Voice t'invoke the Singing Muses  From whence with Leave this Inference we draw  In  ARISTOTLE'S Institutes  'tis Law  "Blank Verse or Rhyme to Instruments well strung  "Shou'd be Recitativ'd or else in Ballad sung"  ARISTOT Fol  LONDON  Printed for T WALLER in FLEETSTREET  Price ONE SHILLING  THE ARGUMENT OF THIS OPERA  A  LEXANDER the Great tempted by the Accounts which several Pri∣soners had related of the immense Wealth in  India  determined upon in∣vading the Dominions of King PORUS who was then its Sovereign  Upon ALEXANDER'S crossing the River  Hy∣daspes  PORUS was made Captive and enter∣tain'd in the  Macedonian  Camp with great Hos∣pitality where the  Indian  Monarch fell in Love with PARISATIS who was betrothed to LYSI∣MACHUS  The Son of PHILIP was ambitious of being thought the best Drinker as well as the greatest Fighter of his Time Both Accomplishments then as now were look'd upon to be Acts which equally constituted the Hero  No Wonder therefore if after the Defeat of the  Indian  King his Conqueror in Honour of the Victory should order a DrinkingMatch And immediately after the Exercise of that En∣gagement or Carousal  The OPERA is supposed to begin  As to the Complexion of PORUS Historians are divided Some supposing him White like the  Chinese  others Coppercolour'd like  Man∣golans  Some declare him to have been only Tawny like the  Malays  But we have fol∣lowed the authenticated Commentaries of ME∣LEAGER and GORGIAS two Generals who were belonging to ALEXANDER One com∣manded the LightHorse the other the LeftWing of the Mirmydonian Infantry at the Time and they declare PORUS to have been a Black  The Editor is aware that some anachronismi∣cal Objections relative to Chronology may be raised against his keeping CLYTUS alive until the Year of the World when the Battle with PORUS was sought But it is according to the Account of BAGOAS who is supposed to be the most impartial Writer in those Times and upon  the Credit of PLUTARCH JUSTINIANUS AR∣RIAN and DIODORUS BAGOAS was Preceptor to ROXANA and it was from him we are told that both the  Zogdian  Princess and THAIS at∣tended ALEXANDER in all his Expeditions  As to the Descent of JUPITER we have not only Pantomimical but also Classical Authority to vindicate such a MeasureIt being com∣mon in  Old Rome  even to a Proverb  Nunc pro Machina  And HORACE allows it in his  Ne  Deus intersit  c  The Scene is laid in  Bucephalon  a City ALEX∣ANDER built in Honour to his
