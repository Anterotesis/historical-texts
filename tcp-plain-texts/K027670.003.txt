 LETTERS OF THE LATE Rev Mr LAURENCE STERNE To his most intimate FRIENDS  WITH A FRAGMENT in the Manner of  Rabelais    To which are prefixed Memoirs of his Life and Family Written by HIMSELF And published by his Daughter Mrs MEDALLE  In THREE VOLUMES  VOL III  LONDON  Printed for T BECKET the Corner of the Adelphi in the Strand  LETTERS  LETTER LXXVIII To Miss S  Bond Street  April  THIS letter my dear Lydia will distress thy good heart for from the beginning thou wilt perceive no entertaining strokes of humour in itI  cannot be chearful when a thousand melancholy ideas surround meI have met with a loss of near fifty pounds which I was taken in for in an extraordinary mannerbut what is that loss in comparison of one I may experienceFriendship is the balm and cordial of life and without it 'tis a heavy load not worth sustainingI am unhappythy mother and thyself at a distance from me and what can compensate for such a destitutionFor God's sake persuade her to come and fix in England for life is too short to waste in separationand whilst she lives in one country and I in another many people will suppose it proceeds from choice  besides I want thee near me thou child and darling of my heartI am in a melancholy mood and my Lydia's eyes will smart with weeping when I tell her the cause that now affects meI am apprehensive the dear friend I mentioned in my last letter is going into a declineI was with her two days ago and I never beheld a being so alter'dshe has a tender frame and looks like a drooping lily for the roses are fled from her cheeksI can never see or talk to this incomparable woman without bursting into tearsI have a thousand obligations to her and I owe her more than her whole sex if not all the world put  togetherShe has a delicacy in her way of thinking that few possessour conversations are of the most interesting nature and she talks to me of quitting this world with more composure than others think of living in itI have wrote an epitaph of which I send thee a copy'Tis expressive of her modest worthbut may heav'n restore her and may she live to write mine  Columns and labour'd urns but vainly shew  An idle scene of decorated woe  The sweet companion and the friend sincere  Need no mechanic help to force the tear  In heart felt numbers never meant to shine  'Twill flow eternal o'er a hearse like thine  'Twill flow whilst gentle goodness has one friend  Or kindred tempers have a tear to lend  Say all that is kind of me to thy mother and believe me my Lydia that I love thee most trulySo adieuI am what I ever was and hope ever shall be thy  Affectionate Father L S  As to Mr by your description he is a fat fool I beg you will  not give up your time to such a beingSend me some  batons pour les dents  there are none good here  LETTER LXXIX To Mr and Mrs J  Old Bondstreet  April  I Am sincerely affected my dear Mr and Mrs Jby your friendly enquiry and the interest you are so good to take in my health God knows I am not able to give a good account of myself having passed a bad night in much feverish agitationMy physician ordered me to bed and to keep therein 'till some favourable changeI fell ill the moment I got  to my lodgingshe says it is owing to my taking James's Powder and venturing out on so cold a day as Sundaybut he is mistaken for I am certain whatever bears that name must have efficacy with meI was bled yesterday and again to day and have been almost dead but this friendly enquiry from Gerrardstreet has poured balm into what blood I have leftI hope still and next to the sense of what I owe my friends it shall be the last pleasurable sensation I will part withif I continue mending it will yet be some time before I shall have strength enough to get out in a carriagemy first visit will be a visit of true gratitudeI leave my kind  friends to guess wherea thousand blessings go along with this and may heaven preserve you bothAdieu my dear sir and dear lady  I am your ever obliged L STERNE  LETTER LXXX To the Earl of  Old Bondstreet  May  My Lord  I Was yesterday taking leave of all the town with an intention of leaving it this day but I am detained by the kindness of lord and lady S who have made a party to dine and sup on my accountI am impatient to set out for my solitude for there the mind gains strength and learns to lean upon herselfIn the world it seeks or accepts of a few treacherous  supportsthe feigned compassion of onethe flattery of a secondthe civilities of a thirdthe friendship of a fourththey all deceive and bring the mind back to where mine is retreating to retirement reflection and books My departure is fixed for tomorrow morning but I could not think of quitting a place where I have received such numberless and unmerited civilities from your lordship without returning my most grateful thanks as well as my hearty acknowledgments for your friendly enquiry from Bath Illness my lord has occasioned my silenceDeath knocked at my door but I would not admit himthe call was both unexpected  and unpleasantand I am seriously worn down to a shadowand still very weak but weak as I am I have as whimsical a story to tell you as ever befel one of my familyShandy's nose his name his sash window are fools to itit will serve at least to amuse youThe injury I did myself last month in catching cold upon James's Powderfell you must know upon the worst part it couldthe most painful and most dangerous of any in the human body It was on this crisis I called in an able surgeon and with him an able physician both my friends to inspect my disaster'tis a venereal case cried my two scientific friends'tis impossible however  to be that replied Ifor I have had no commerce whatever with the sex not even with my wife added I these fifteen yearsYou are however my good friend said the surgeon or there is no such case in the worldwhat the devil said I without knowing womanWe will not reason about it said the physician but you must undergo a course of mercuryI will lose my life first said Iand trust to nature to time or at the worst to deathso I put an end with some indignation to the conferenceand determined to bear all the torments I underwent and ten times more rather than submit to be treated like a  sinner  in a point where I had acted  like a  saint  Now as the father of mischief would have it who has no pleasure like that of dishonouring the righteous it so fell out that from the moment I dismissed my doctors my pains began to rage with a violence not to be expressed or supported Every hour became more intolerableI was got to bed cried out and raved the whole night and was got up so near dead that my friends insisted upon my sending again for my physician and surgeon I told them upon the word of a man of honour they were both mistaken as to my casebut though they had reasoned wrong they might act right but that sharp as my sufferings were I  felt them not so sharp as the imputation which a venereal treatment of my case laid me underThey answered that these taints of the blood laid dormant twenty years but they would not reason with me in a point wherein I was so delicate but would do all the office for which they were called in namely to put an end to my torment which otherwise would put an end to meand so have I been compelled to surrender myselfand thus my dear lord has your poor friend with all his sensibilities been suffering the chastisement of the grossest sensualistWas it not as ridiculous an embarrassment as ever Yorick's spirit was involved inNothing  but the purest conscience of innocence could have tempted me to write this story to my wife which by the bye would make no bad anecdote in Tristram Shandy's LifeI have mentioned it in my journal to Mrs In some repects there is no difference between my wife and herselfwhen they fare alike neither can reasonably complainI have just received letters from France with some hints that Mrs Sterne and my Lydia are coming to England to pay me a visitif your time is not better employed Yorick flatters himself he shall receive a letter from your lordship  en attendant    I am with the greatest regard  my Lord  your Lordship's most faithful humble servant L STERNE  LETTER LXXXII To J Dn Esq  Old Bondstreet  Friday Morning  I Was going my dear Dn to bed before I received your kind enquiry and now my chaise stands at my door to take and convey this poor body to its legal settlementI am ill very illI languish most affectinglyI am sick both soul and bodyit is a cordial to me to hear it is different with youno man interests himself more in your happiness and I am glad you are in so fair a road to itenjoy it  long my D whilst Ino matter whatbut my feelings are too nice for the world I live inthings will mendI dined yesterday with lord and lady S we talked much of you and your goings on for every one knows why Sunbury Hill is so pleasant a situationYou rogue you have lock'd up my bootsand I go bootless homeand fear I shall go bootless all my lifeAdieu gentlest and best of soulsadieu  I am yours most affectionately L STERNE  LETTER LXXXIII To J H S Esq  Newark  Monday ten o'clock in the morn  My dear Cousin  I Have got conveyed thus far like a bale of cadaverous goods consigned to Pluto and companylying in the bottom of my chaise most of the rout upon a large pillow which I had the  prevoyance  to purchase before I set outI am worn outbut press on to Barnby Moor to night and if possible to York the nextI know not what is the matter with mebut some  derangement  presses hard upon this machinestill I think it will not be overset this boutMy love to GWe shall all meet from the east and from the south and as at the last be happy togetherMy kind respects to a fewI am dear H  truly yours L STERNE  LETTER LXXXIV From Ignatius Sancho to Mr Sterne  Reverend Sir  IT would be an insult on your humanity or perhaps look like it to apologize for the liberty I am takingI am one of those people whom the vulgar and illiberal call negroesThe first part of my life was rather unlucky as I was placed in a family who judged ignorance the best and  only security for obedienceA little reading and writing I got by unwearied applicationThe latter part of my life has been thro' God's blessing truly fortunatehaving spent it in the service of one of the best and greatest families in the kingdommy chief pleasure has been booksPhilanthropy I adoreHow very much good Sir am I amongst millions indebted to you for the character of your amiable Uncle TobyI declare I would walk ten miles in the dogdays to shake hands with the honest CorporalYour sermons have touch'd me to the heart and I hope have amended it which brings me to the pointIn your tenth discourse page  seventyeight in the second volumeis this very affecting passage  "Consider how great a part of our species in all ages down to thishave been trod under the feet of cruel and capricious tyrants who would neither hear their cries nor pity their distressesConsider slaverywhat it ishow bitter a draughtand how many millions are made to drink of it"  Of all my favourite authors not one has drawn a tear in favour of my miserable black brethrenexcepting yourself and the humane author of Sir Geo EllisonI think you will forgive me I am sure you will applaud me for beseeching you to give one  half hour's attention to slavery as it is at this day practised in our West IndiesThat subject handled in your striking manner would ease the yoke perhaps of manybut if only of onegracious God what a feast to a benevolent heart and sure I am you are an epicurean in acts of charityYou who are universally read and as universally admiredyou could not failDear Sir think in me you behold the uplifted hands of thousands of my brother Moors Grief you pathetically observe is eloquent figure to yourself their attitudes hear their supplicating addressesalas you cannot refuseHumanity must complyin  which hope I beg permission to subscribe myself  Reverend Sir c  L S  LETTER LXXXV From Mr Sterne to Ignatius Sancho  Coxwould  July  THERE is a strange coincidence Sancho in the little events as well as in the great ones of this world for I had been writing a tender tale of the sorrows of a friendless poor negrogirl and my eyes had scarce done smarting with it when your letter of recommendation in behalf of so many of her brethren and sisters came to mebut why  her brethren  or yours Sancho any more  than mine It is by the finest tints and most insensible gradations that nature descends from the fairest face about St James's to the sootiest complexion in Africaat which tint of these is it that the ties of blood are to cease and how many shades must we descend lower still in the scale ere mercy is to vanish with them But 'tis no uncommon thing my good Sancho for one half of the world to use the other half of it like brutes and then endeavour to make 'em soFor my own part I never look  westward  when I am in a pensive mood at least but I think of the burthens which our brothers and sisters are  there  carrying and could I ease their  shoulders from one ounce of them I declare I would set out this hour upon a pilgrimage to Mecca for their sakeswhich by the bye Sancho exceeds your walk of ten miles in about the same proportion that a visit of humanity should one of mere formHowever if you meant my Uncle Toby more he is your debtorIf I can weave the tale I have wrote into the work I am about'tis at the service of the afflictedand a much greater matter for in serious truth it casts a sad shade upon the world that so great a part of it are and have been so long bound in chains of darkness and in chains of misery and I cannot but both respect and felicitate  you that by so much laudable diligence you have broke the oneand that by falling into the hands of so good and merciful a family Providence has rescued you from the other  And so goodhearted Sancho adieu and believe me I will not forget your letter  Yours L STERNE  LETTER LXXXVI To Ignatius Sancho  Bond Street  Saturday  I Was very sorry my good Sancho that I was not at home to return my compliments by you for the great courtesy of the Duke of Mg's family to me in honouring my list of subscribers with their namesfor which I bear them all thanksBut you have something to add Sancho to what I owe your good will also on this account and that is to send me the subscription money which I find  a necessity of duning my best friends for before I leave townto avoid the perplexities of both keeping pecuniary accounts for which I have very slender talents and collecting them for which I have neither strength of body or mind and so good Sancho dun the Duke of M the Duchess of M and Lord M for their subscriptions and lay the sin and money with it too at my doorI wish so good a family every blessing they merit along with my humblest compliments You know Sancho that I am your friend and wellwisher  L STERNE  PS  I leave town on Friday morningand should on Thursday but that I stay to dine with Lord and Lady S  LETTER LXXXVII To Ignatius Sancho  Coxwould  June  I Must acknowledge the courtesy of my good friend Sancho's letter were I ten times busier than I am and must thank him too for the many expressions of his good will and good opinion'Tis all affectation to say a man is not gratified with being praisedwe only want it to be sincereand then it will be taken Sancho as kindly as yours I left town very poorlyand with an idea I was taking  leave of it for everbut good air a quiet retreat and quiet reflections along with it with an ass to milk and another to ride out upon if I chuse it all together do wondersI shall live this year at least I hope be it but to give the world before I quit it as good impressions of me as you have Sancho I would only covenant for just so much health and spirits as are sufficient to carry my pen thro' the task I have set it this summerBut I am a resign'd being Sancho and take health and sickness as I do light and darkness or the vicissitudes of seasonsthat is just as it pleases God to send themand accommodate myself to their periodical returns as well  as I canonly taking care whatever befalls me in this silly worldnot to lose my temper at itThis I believe friend Sancho to be the truest philosophyfor this we must be indebted to ourselves but not to our fortunesFarewelI hope you will not forget your custom of giving me a call at my lodgings next winterin the mean time I am very cordially  My honest friend Sancho  Yours L STERNE  LETTER LXXXVIII To Mrs H  Coxwould  October  EVER since my dear H wrote me word she was mine more than ever woman was I have been racking my memory to inform me where it was that you and I had that affair togetherPeople think that I have had many some in body some in mind but as I  told you before you have had me more than any womantherefore you must have had me H both in mind and in bodyNow I cannot recollect where

relationI felicitate you I don't say how much because I can'tI always had something like a kind of revelation within me which  pointed out this track for you in which you are so happily advancedit was not only my wishes for you which were ever ardent enough to impose upon a visionary brain but I thought I actually saw you just where you now areand that is just my dear Macartney where you should beI should long long ago have acknowledged the kindness of a letter of yours from Petersbourg but hearing daily accounts you was leaving itthis is the first time I knew well  where  my thanks would find youhow they will find you I know wellthat isthe same I ever knew you In three weeks I shall kiss your handand sooner if I can finish my Sentimental  JourneyThe duce take all sentiments I wish there was not one in the worldMy wife is come to pay me a sentimental visit as far as from Avignonand the  politesses  arising from such a proof of her urbanity has robb'd me of a month's writing or I had been in town nowI am going to lyin being at Christmas at my full reckoningand unless what I shall bring forth is not  press'd  to death by these devils of printers I shall have the honour of presenting to you a  couple of as clean brats  as ever chaste brain conceiv'dthey are frolicksome too  mais cela n'empeche pas  I put your name down with many wrong and right  honourables  knowing you

letter greeted me with the seal of friendship and most cordially do I thank you for so kind a proof of your good willI was truly anxious to hear of the recovery of my sentimental friend  but I would not write to enquire after her unless I could have sent her the testimony without the tax for even howd'yes to invalids or those that have lately been so either call to mind what is past or what may returnat least I find it soI am as happy as a prince at Coxwouldand I wish you could see in how princely a manner I live'tis a land of plenty I sit down alone to venison fish and wild fowl or a couple of fowls or ducks with curds and strawberries and cream and all the simple plenty which a rich valley under Hamilton Hills can producewith a clean cloth on my tableand  a bottle of wine on my right hand to drink your health I have a hundred hens and chickens about my yardand not a parishioner catches a hare or a rabbet or a trout but he brings it as an offering to me If solitude would cure a lovesick heart I would give you an invitationbut absence and time lessen no attachment which virtue inspiresI am in high spiritscare never enters this cottageI take the air every day in my post chaise with my two long tail'd horsesthey turn out good ones and as to myself I think I am better upon the whole for the medicines and regimen I submitted to in townMay  you dear L want neither the one nor the other  Yours truly L STERNE  LETTER XCIII To the same  Coxwould  June  I Am in still better health my dear Le than when I wrote last to youowing I believe to my riding out every day with my friend H whose castle lies near the seaand there is a beach as even as a mirrour of five miles in length before itwhere we daily run races in our chaises with one wheel in the sea and the other on the landD has obtain'd his fair Indian and has  this post sent a letter of enquiries after Yorick and his Bramine He is a good soul and interests himself much in our fateI cannot forgive you Le for your folly in saying you intend to get introduced to the I despise them and I shall hold your understanding much cheaper than I now do if you persist in a resolution so unworthy of youI suppose Mrs J telling you they were sensible is the ground work you go uponbythey are not clever tho' what is commonly call'd wit may pass for literature on the other side of TemplebarYou say Mrs J thinks them amiableshe judges too favourably but I have put a stop  to her intentions of visiting themThey are bitter enemies of mine and I am even with them La Bramine assured me they used their endeavours with her to break off her friendship with me for reasons I will not write but tell youI said enough of them before she left England and tho' she yielded to me in every other point yet in this she obstinately persistedStrange infatuationbut I think I have effected my purpose by a falsity which Yorick's friendship to the Bramine can only justifyI wrote her word that the most amiable of women reiterated my request that she would not write to them I said too she had conceal'd many things  for the sake of her peace of mindwhen in fact Le this was merely a child of my own brain made Mrs J's by adoption to enforce the argument I had before urged so stronglyDo not mention this circumstance to Mrs J 'twould displease herand I had no design in it but for the Bramine to be a friend to herselfI ought now to be busy from sun rise to sun set for I have a book to writea wife to receivean estate to sella parish to superintend and what is worst of all a disquieted heart to reason withthese are continual calls upon meI have receiv'd half a dozen letters to press me to join my friends at Scarborough but I am  at present deaf to them allI perhaps may pass a few days there something later in the season not at presentand so dear Le adieu  I am most cordially yours L STERNE  LETTER XCIV To Mr and Mrs J  Coxwould  July  IT is with as much true gratitude as ever heart felt that I sit down to thank my dear friends Mr and Mrs J for the continuation of their attention to me but for this last instance of their humanity and politeness to me I must ever be their debtorI never can thank you enough  my dear friends and yet I thank you from my souland for the single day's happiness your goodness would have sent me I wish I could send you back thousandsI cannot but they will come of themselvesand so God bless youI have had twenty times my pen in my hand since I came down to write one letter to you both in Gerrardstreetbut I am a shy kind of a soul at the bottom and have a jealousy about troubling my friends especially about myselfI am now got perfectly well but was a month after my arrival in the country in but a poor statemy body has got the start and is at present more at ease than my mindbut  this world is a school of trials and so heaven's will be doneI hope you have both enjoyed all that I have wantedand to compleat your joy that your little lady flourishes like a vine at your table to which I hope to see her preferred by next winterI am now beginning to be truly busy at my Sentimental Journeythe pains and sorrows of this life having retarded its progressbut I shall make up my leeway and overtake every body in a very short time  What can I send you that Yorkshire produces tell meI want to be of use to you for I am my dear  friends with the truest value and esteem  your ever

subscriptions or subscriptions in FrancePresent my kindest service to Miss P I know her politeness and good nature will incline her to give Mrs J her advice about what she may venture to bring overI hope every thing goes on well though never half so well as I wish  God prosper you my dear friendBelieve me most warmly  Yours L STERNE  The sooner you send me the gold snuff box the better'tis a present from my best friend  LETTER XCVI To Mr and Mrs J  Coxwould  August  MY dear friends Mr and Mrs J are infinitely kind to me in sending now and then a letter to enquire after meand to acquaint me how they areYou cannot conceive my dear lady how truly I bear a part in your illnessI wish Mr J would carry you to the south of France in pursuit of healthbut why need I wish it when I know his affection will make him do that and ten times  as much to prevent a return of those symptoms which alarmed him so much in the springYour politeness and humanity is always contriving to treat me agreeably and what you promise next winter will be perfectly sobut you must get welland your little dear girl must be of the party with her parents and friends to give it a relishI am sure you shew no partiality but what is natural and praiseworthy in behalf of your daughter but I wonder my friends will not find her a playfellow and I both hope and advise them not to venture along through this warfare of life without two strings at least to their bowI had letters from France by  last night's post by which by some fatality I find not one of my letters has reached Mrs S This gives me concern as it wears the aspect of unkindness which she by no means merits from meMy wife and dear girl are coming to pay me a visit for a few months I wish I may prevail with them to tarry longerYou must permit me dear Mrs J to make my Lydia known to you if I can prevail with my wife to come and spend a little time in London as she returns to FranceI expect a small parcelmay I trouble you before you write next to send to my lodgings to ask if there is any thing directed to me that you can enclose under coverI have  but one excuse for this freedom which I am prompted to use from a persuasion that it is doing you pleasure to give you an opportunity of doing an obliging thingand as to myself I rest satisfied for 'tis only scoring up another debt of thanks to the millions I owe you both alreadyReceive a thousand and a thousand thanks yes and with them ten thousand friendly wishes for all you wish in this worldMay my friend Mr J continue bless'd with good health and may his good lady get perfectly well there being no woman's health or comfort I so ardently pray forAdieu my dear friendsbelieve me most truly and faithfully yours  L STERNE  PS In Eliza's last letter dated from St Jago she tells me as she does you that she is extremely illGod protect herBy this time surely she has set foot upon dry land at MadrasI heartily wish her well and if Yorick was with her he would tell her sobut he is cut off from this by bodily absenceI am present with her in spirit howeverbut what is that you will say  LETTER XCVII To J H S Esq  Coxwould  August  My dear H  I Am glad all has passed with so much amity  inter te filium Marcum+tuum  and that Madame has found grace in thy sightAll is well that ends welland so much for moralizing upon it I wish you could or would take up your parable and prophecy as much good concerning me and my affairsNot one of my letters have got to Mrs S since the  notification of her intentions which has a pitiful air on my side though I have wrote her six or sevenI imagine she will be here the latter end of September though I have no date for it but her impatience which having suffered by my supposed silence I am persuaded will make her fear the worstif that is the case she will fly to Englanda most natural conclusionYou did well to discontinue all commerce with James's powderas you are so well rejoice therefore and let your heart be merrymine ought upon the same scorefor I never have been so well since I left collegeand should be a marvellous happy man but for some reflections which bow  down my spiritsbut if I live but even three or four years I will acquit myself with honourandno matter we will talk this over when we meetIf all ends as temperately as with you and that I find grace c c I will come and sing Te Deum or drink  poculum elevatum  or do any thing with you in the worldI should depend upon G's critick upon my head as much as Moliere's old woman upon his comedieswhen you do not want her society let it be carried into your bedchamber to flay her or clap it upon her bumtoand give her my blessing as you do it  My postillion has set me aground for a week by one of my pistols bursting in his hand which he taking for granted to be quite shot offhe instantly fell upon his knees and said Our Father which art in Heaven hallowed be thy Name at which like a good Christian he stopped not remembering any more of itthe affair was not so bad as he at first thought for it has only  bursten  two of his fingers he saysI long to return to you but I sit here alone as solitary and sad as a tom cat which by the bye is all the company I keephe follows me from the parlour to the kitchen into the garden and every placeI wish I had a dog  my daughter will bring me oneand so God be about you and strengthen your faithI am affectionately dear cousin yours  L S  My service to the C though they are from home and to Panty  LETTER XCVIII To Mr and Mrs J  Coxwould  August  My dear Friends  I But copy your great civility to me in writing you word that I have this moment received another letter wrote eighteen days after the date of the last from St JagoIf our poor friend could have wrote another letter to England you would in course have had itbut I fear from the circumstance of great hurry and bodily disorder in  which she was when she dispatched this she might not have timeIn case it has so fallen out I send you the contents of what I have receivedand that is a melancholy history of herself and sufferings since they left St Jagocontinual and most violent rheumatism all the timea fever brought on with fits and attended with delirium and every terrifying symptomthe recovery from this left her low and emaciated to a skeletonI give you the pain of this detail with a bleeding heart knowing how much at the same time it will affect yoursThe three or four last days of her journal leave us with hopes she will do well at last for she is  more chearfuland seems to be getting into better spirits and health will follow in course They have crossed the lineare much becalmed which with other delays she fears they will lose their passage to Madrassand be some months sooner for it at BombayHeav'n protect her for she suffers much and with uncommon fortitudeShe writes much to me about her dear friend Mrs J in her last packetIn truth my good lady she loves and honours you from her heart but if she did not I should not esteem her or wish her so well as I doAdieu my dear friendsyou have  few in the world more truly and cordially  Yours L STERNE  PS I have just received as a present from a man I shall ever love a most elegant gold snuff box fabricated for me at Paris'tis not the first pledge I have received of his friendshipMay I presume to enclose you a letter of chitchat which I shall

they will get late in the year to their destined port as they go first to Bengal  LETTER XCIX To Miss S  Coxwould  August  I Am truly surprised my dear Lydia that my last letter has not reached thy mother and thyselfit looks most unkind on my part after your having wrote me word of your mother's intention of coming to England that she has not received my letter to welcome you bothand though in that I said I wished you would defer your journey 'till March for before  that time I should have published my sentimental work and should be in town to receive youyet I will shew you more real politesses than any you have met with in France as mine will come warm from the heartI am sorry you are not here at the races but  les fêtes champêtres  of the Marquis de Sade have made you amendsI know B very well and he is what in France would be called admirablethat would be but so so hereYou are righthe studies nature more than any or rather most of the French comediansIf the Empress of Russia pays him and his wife a pension of twenty thousand livres a year I think he is very well off  The folly of staying 'till after twelve for supperthat you two excommunicated beings might have meat  "his conscience would not let it be served before"  Surely the Marquis thought you both being English could not be satisfied without itI would have given not my gown and cassock for I have but one but my topaz ring to have seen the  petits maitres et maitresses  go to mass after having spent the night in dancingAs to my pleasures they are few in compassMy poor cat sits purring beside meyour lively French dog shall have his place on the other side of my firebut if he is as devilish as when I last saw him I must tutor  him for I will not have my cat abusedin short I will have nothing devilish about mea combustion would spoil a sentimental thought  Another thing I must desiredo not be alarmed'tis to throw all your rouge pots into the Sorgue before you set outI will have no rouge put on in Englandand do not bewail them as did her silver seringue or glyster equipage which she lost in a certain riverbut take a wise resolution of doing without rougeI have been three days ago bad againwith a spitting of bloodand that unfeeling brute ******* came and drew my curtains  and with a voice like a trumpet halloo'd in my earzds what a fine kettle of fish have you brought yourself to Mr S In a faint voice I bad him leave me for comfort sure was never administered in so rough a mannerTell your mother I hope she will purchase what either of you may want at Paris'tis an occasion not to be lostso write to me from Paris that I may come and meet you in my postchaise with my longtailed horsesand the moment you have both put your feet in it call it hereafter yoursAdieu dear Lydiabelieve me what I ever shall be  Your affectionate father L STERNE  I think I shall not write to Avignon any more but you will find one for you at Parisonce more adieu  LETTER C To Sir W  September  My dear Sir  YOU are perhaps the drollest being in the universeWhy do you banter me so about what I wrote to youTho' I told you every morning I jump'd into Venus's lap meaning thereby the sea was you to infer from that that I leap'd into the ladies beds afterwardsThe body guides youthe mind meI have  wrote the most whimsical letter to a lady that was ever read and talk'd of body and soul tooI said she had made me vain by saying she was mine more than ever woman wasbut she is not the lady of Bondstreet nor square nor the lady who supp'd with me in Bondstreet on scollop'd oysters and other such thingsnor did she ever go  teteatete  with me to Salt HillEnough of such nonsenseThe past is overand I can justify myself unto myselfcan you do as muchNo faith  "You can feel"  Aye so can my cat when he hears a female caterwauling on the house topbut caterwauling disgusts me I  had rather raise a gentle flame than have a different one raised in meNow I take heav'n to witness after all this  badinage  my heart is innocentand the sporting of my pen is equal just equal to what I did in my boyish days when I got astride of a stick and gallop'd awayThe truth is thisthat my pen governs menot me my penYou are much to blame if you dig for marle unless you are sure of itI was once such a puppy myself as to pare and burn and had my labour for my pains and two hundred pounds out of pocketCurse on farming said I I will try if the pen will not succeed better than the spadeThe following  up of that affair I mean farming made me lose my temper and a cart load of turneps was I thought very dear at two hundred pounds  In all your operations may your own good sense guide youbought experience is the devilAdieu adieuBelieve me  Yours most truly L STERNE  LETTER CI To the same

to London where you generally are in springand then my Sentimental Journey will I dare say convince you that my feelings are from the heart and that that heart is not of the worst of moldspraised be God for my sensibility Though it has often made me wretched yet I would not exchange it for all the pleasures the grossest sensualist ever feltWrite to me the day you  will be at York'tis ten to one but I may introduce you to my wife and daughter Believe me  My good Sir  Ever yours L STERNE  LETTER CII To Mr P at Paris  York  October  Dear Sir  I Have order'd my friend Becket to advance for two

publicationTomorrow morning I repair with her to Coxwould and my Lydia seems transported with the sight of meNature dear P breathes in all her composition and except a little vivacitywhich is a fault in the world we live inI am fully content with her mother's care of herPardon this digression from businessbut 'tis natural to speak of those we loveAs to the subscriptions which your friendship has procured me I must have them to incorporate with my lists which are to be prefix'd to the first volumeMy wife and daughter join in millions of thanksthey will leave me  the st of DecemberAdieu adieubelieve me  Your's most truly L STERNE  LETTER CIII To Mr and Mrs J  Coxwould  October  I Have suffered under a strong desire for above this fortnight to send a letter of enquiries after the health and the wellbeing of my dear friends Mr and Mrs J and I do assure you both 'twas merely owing to a little modesty in my temper not to make my goodwill troublesome where I have so much and to those  I never think of but with ideas of sensibility and obligation that I have refrain'dGood God to think I could be in town and not go the first step I made to Gerrard StreetMy mind and body must be at sad variance with each other should it ever fall out that it is not both the first and last place also where I shall betake myself were it only to say "God bless you"May you have every blessing he can send you 'tis a part of my litany where you will always have a place whilst I have a tongue to repeat itAnd so you heard I had left Scarborough which you would no more credit than the reasons assign'd for itI thank you  for it kindlytho' you have not told me what they were being a shrewd divine I think I can guessI was ten days at Scarborough in September and was hospitably entertained by one of the best of our Bishops who as he kept house there press'd me to be with himand his houshold consisted of a gentleman and two ladieswhich with the good Bishop and myself made so good a party that we kept much to ourselvesI made in this time a connection of great friendship with my mitred host who would gladly have taken me with him back to IrelandHowever we all left Scarborough together and lay fifteen miles off where we kindly parted  Now it was supposed and have since heard that I e'en went on with the party to London and this I suppose was the reason assign'd for my being thereI dare say charity would add a little to the account and give out that 'twas on the score of one and perhaps both of the ladiesand I will excuse charity on that head for a heart disengaged could not well have done betterI have been hard writing ever sinceand hope by Christmas I shall be able to give a gentle rap at your doorand tell you how happy I am to see my two good friendsI assure you I spur on my Pegasus more violently upon that account and am now determined  not to draw bit till I have finish'd this Sentimental Journeywhich I hope to lay at your feet as a small but a very honest testimony of the constant truth with which I am  My dear friends  Your ever obliged And grateful L STERNE  PS  My wife and daughter arrived here last night from FranceMy girl has return'd an elegant accomplish'd little slutmy wifebut I hate to praise my wife'tis as  much as decency will allow to praise my daughterI suppose they will return next summer to FranceThey leave me in a month to reside

desires of seeing its kind possessors but the hopes before me of doing it by ChristmasI long sadly to see youand my friend Mr J I am still at Coxwouldmy wife and girl  Mrs Medalle thinks an apology may be necessary for publishing this letterthe best she can offer isthat it was written by a fond parent whose commendations she is proud of to a very sincere friend  hereShe is a dear good creatureaffectionate and most elegant in body and mindshe is all heaven could give me in a daughterbut like other blessings not given but lent for her mother loves  Franceand this dear part of me must be torn from my arms to follow her mother who seems inclined to establish her in France where she has had many advantageous offersDo not smile at my weakness when I say I don't wonder at it for she is as accomplish'd a slut as France can produceYou shall excuse all thisif you won't I desire Mr J to be my advocatebut I know I don't want oneWith what pleasure shall I embrace your dear little

answer for those two It is a subject which works well and suits the frame of mind I have been in for some time pastI told you my design  in it was to teach us to love the world and our fellow creatures better than we doso it runs most upon those gentler passions and affections which aid so much to itAdieu and may you and my worthy friend Mr J continue examples of the doctrine I teach  LETTER CVI To A Le Esq  Coxwould  November  YOU make yourself unhappy dear Le by imaginary illswhich you might shun instead of putting yourself in the way ofWould not any man in his senses fly from the object he adores and not waste his time and his health in increasing his misery by so vain a pursuitThe idol of your heart is one  of ten thousandThe duke of has long sighed in vainand can you suppose a woman will listen to you that is proof against titles stars and red ribbandsHer heart believe me Le will not be taken in by fine men or fine speechesif it should ever feel a preference it will chuse an object for itself and it must be a singular character that can make an impression on such a beingshe has a platonic way of thinking and knows love only by namethe natural reserve of her character which you complain of proceeds not from pride but from a superiority of understanding which makes her despise every man that turns himself  into a foolTake my advice and pay your addresses to Miss she esteems you and time will wear off an attachment which has taken so deep a root in your heartI pity you from my soulbut we are all born with passions which ebb and flow else they would play the devil with us to different objectsand the best advice I can give you Le is to turn the tide of yours another wayI know not whether I shall write again while I stay at CoxwouldI am in earnest

My Lord  'TIS with the greatest pleasure I take my pen to thank your Lordship for your letter of enquiry about Yorickhe has worn out both his spirits and body with the Sentimental Journey'tis true that an author must feel himself or his  reader will notbut I have torn my whole frame into pieces by my feelingsI believe the brain stands as much in need of recruiting as the bodytherefore I shall set out for town the twentieth of next month after having recruited myself a week at YorkI might indeed solace myself with my wife who is come from France but in fact I have long been a sentimental beingwhatever your Lordship may think to the contraryThe world has imagined because I wrote Tristram Shandy that I was myself more Shandean than I really ever was'tis a goodnatured world we live in and we are  often painted in divers colours according to the ideas each one frames in his headA very agreeable lady arrived three years ago at York in her road to ScarboroughI had the honour of being acquainted with her and was her  chaperon  all the females were very inquisitive to know who she was  "Do not tell ladies 'tis a mistress my wife has recommended to menay moreover has sent her from France"  I hope my book will please you my Lord and then my labour will not be totally in vain If it is not  thought a chaste book mercy on them that read it for they must have warm imaginations indeedCan your Lordship forgive my not making this a longer epistleIn short I can but add this which you already knowthat I am with gratitude and friendship  My Lord  Your obedient faithful L STERNE

interesting a letter as yoursI am certain you may depend upon Lord 's promiseshe will take care of you in the best manner he can and your knowledge of the world and of languages in particular will make you useful in  any departmentIf his Lordship's scheme does not succeed leave the kingdomgo to the east or the west for travelling would be of infinite service to both your body and mindBut more of this when we meetnow to my own affairsI have had an offer of exchanging two pieces of preferment I hold here for a living of three hundred and fifty pounds a year in Surry about thirty miles from London and retaining Coxwould and my prebendaryshipthe country also is sweetbut I will not cannot come to any determination till I have consulted with you and my other friendsI have great offers too in Irelandthe bishops  of C and R are both my friendsbut I have rejected every proposal unless Mrs S and my Lydia could accompany me thitherI live for the sake of my girl and with her sweet light burthen in my arms I could get up fast the hill of preferment if I chose itbut without my Lydia if a mitre was offered me it would sit uneasy upon my browMrs S's health is insupportable in EnglandShe must return to France and justice and humanity forbid me to oppose itI will allow her enough to live comfortably until she can rejoin meMy heart bleeds Le when I think of parting with my child  'twill be like the separation of soul and bodyand equal to nothing but what passes at that tremendous moment and like it in one respect for she will be in one kingdom whilst I am in anotherYou will laugh at my weaknessbut I cannot help itfor she is a dear disinterested girlAs a proof of itwhen she left Coxwould and I bad her adieu I pulled out my purse and offered her ten guineas for her private pleasuresher answer was pretty and affected me too much  "No my dear papa our expences of coming from France may have straiten'd youI would rather put an hundred guineas in your pocket than take ten out of it"  I burst into tearsbut why do I practice on your feelingsby dwelling on a subject that will touch your heartIt is too much melted already by its own sufferings Le for me to add a pang or cause a single sighGod bless youI shall hope to greet you by Newyearsday in perfect healthAdieu my dear friendI am most truly and cordially yours  L STERNE  LETTER CIX To Mr and Mrs J  York  December  I Was afraid that either Mr or Mrs J or their little blossom was droopingor that some of you were ill by not having the pleasure of a line from you and was thinking of writing again to enquire after you allwhen I was cast down myself with a fever and bleeding at my  lungs which had confined me to my room near three weekswhen I had the favour of yours which till today I have not been able to thank you both kindly for as I most cordially now doas well as for all your professions and proofs of good will to meI will not say I have not balanced accounts with you in thisAll I know is that I honour and value you more than I do any good creatures upon earthand that I could not wish your happiness and the success of whatever conduces to it more than I do was I your brotherbut good God are we not all brothers and sisters who are friendly virtuous and good  Surely my dear friends my illness has been a sort of sympathy for your afflictions upon the score of your dear little oneI am worn down to a shadowbut as my fever has left me I set off the latter end of next week with my friend Mr Hall for townI need not tell my friends in Gerrardstreet I shall do myself the honour to visit them before either Lord or Lord c cI thank you my dear friend for what you say so kindly about my daughterit shews your good heart for as she is a stranger 'tis a free gift in youbut when she is known to you she

attachment and esteem ever yours  L STERNE  LETTER CX To Lady P  Mount Coffeehouse  Tuesday o'Clock  THERE is a strange mechanical effect produced in writing a billetdoux within a stonecast of the lady who engrosses the heart and soul of an inamoratofor this cause but mostly because I am to dine in this neighbourhood have I Tristram Shandy come forth from my lodgings to a coffeehouse the nearest I  could find to my dear Lady 's house and have called for a sheet of gilt paper to try the truth of this article of my creedNow for it  O my dear ladywhat a dishclout of a soul hast thou made of meI think by the bye this is a little too familiar an introduction for so unfamiliar a situation as I stand in with youwhere heaven knows I am kept at a distanceand despair of getting one inch nearer you with all the steps and windings I can think of to recommend myself to youWould not any man in his senses run diametrically from youand as far as his legs  would carry him rather than thus causelessly foolishly and foolhardily expose himself afreshand afresh where his heart and his reason tells him he shall be sure to come off loser if not totally undoneWhy would you tell me you would be glad to see meDoes it give you pleasure to make me more unhappyor does it add to your triumph that your eyes and lips have turned a man into a fool whom the rest of the town is courting as a witI am a foolthe weakest the most ductile the most tender fool that ever woman tried the weakness ofand the most unsettled in my purposes and resolutions  of recovering my right mindIt is but an hour ago that I kneeled down and swore I never would come near youand after saying my Lord's Prayer for the sake of the close of not being led into temptationout I sallied like any Christian hero ready to take the field against the world the flesh and the devil not doubting but I should finally trample them all down under my feetand now am I got so near youwithin this vile stone's cast of your houseI feel myself drawn into a vortex that has turned my brain upside downwards and though I had purchased a box ticket to carry me  to Miss ******* benefit yet I know very well that was a single line directed to me to let me know Lady would be alone at seven and suffer me to spend the evening with her she would infallibly see every thing verified I have told herI dine at Mr Cr's in Wigmorestreet in this neighbourhood where I shall stay till seven in hopes you purpose to put me to this proof If I hear nothing by that time I shall conclude you are better disposed ofand shall take a sorry hack and sorrily jogg on to the playCurse on the word I know nothing but sorrowexcept  this one thing that I love you perhaps foolishly but  most sincerely L STERNE  LETTER CXI To Mr and Mrs J  Old Bond Street

already owe youI am sorry that I am no subscriber to Soho this seasonit deprives me of a pleasure worth twice the subscriptionbut I am just going to send about this quarter of the town to see if it is not too late to procure a ticket undisposed of from some of my Soho friends and if I can succeed I will either send or wait upon you with it  by half an hour after three tomorrowif not my friend will do me the justice to believe me truly miserableI am half engaged or more for dinner on Sunday next but will try to get disengaged in order to be with my friendsIf I cannot I will glide like a shadow

circleand if you do not hear from me by a quarter after three you may conclude I have been unfortunate in my supplicationsI send you this state of the affair lest my silence should make you think I had neglected what I promisedbut noMrs J knows me better and would never suppose it would be out of the head of one who is with so much truth  Her faithful friend L STERNE  LETTER CXIII To the same  Thursday  Old Bond Street  A Thousand thanks and as many excuses my dear friends for the trouble my blunder has given you By a second note I am astonish'd I could read Saturday for Sunday or make any mistake in a card wrote by Mrs Js in which my friend is as unrival'd as in a hundred greater excellencies  I am now tyed down neck and heels twice over by engagements every day this week or most joyfully would have trod the old pleasing road from Bond to Gerrard StreetMy books will be to be had on Thursday but possibly on Wednesday in the afternoonI am quite well but exhausted with a room full of company every morning till dinnerHow do I lament I cannot eat my morsel which is always sweet with such kind friendsThe Sunday following I will assuredly wait upon you bothand will come a quarter before four that I may have both a little time and a little day light to see Mrs J's pictureI beg leave to assure my  friends of my gratitude for all their favours with my sentimental thanks for every token of their good willAdieu my dear friends  I am truly yours L STERNE  LETTER CXIV To L S Esq  Old Bond Street  Wednesday  Dear Sir  YOUR commendations are very flattering I know no one whose judgement I think more highly of but your partiality for me is the only instance in which I can call it in questionThanks my good sir for the printsI am much your debtor for themif I recover from my ill  state of health and live to revisit Coxwould this summer I will decorate my study with them along with six beautiful pictures I have already of the sculptures on poor Ovid's tomb which were executed on marble at RomeIt grieves one to think such a man should have dy'd in exile who wrote so well on the art of loveDo not think me encroaching if I sollicit a favour'tis either to borrow or beg to beg if you please some of those touched with chalk which you brought from ItalyI believe you have three sets and if you can spare the imperfect one of cattle on colour'd paper 'twill answer my purpose which is namely this to give  a friend of oursYou may be ignorant she has a genius for drawing and whatever she excells in she conceals and her humility adds lustre to her accomplishmentsI presented her last year with colours and an apparatus for painting and gave her several lessons before I left townI wish her to follow this art to be a compleat mistress of itand it is singular enough but not more singular than true that she does not know how to make a cow or a sheep tho' she draws figures and landscapes perfectly well which makes me wish her to copy from good printsIf you come to town next week and dine where I am engaged next  Sunday call upon me and take me with youI breakfast with Mr Beauclerc and am engaged for an hour afterwards with Lord O so let our meeting be either at your house or my lodgingsdo not be late for we will go half an hour before dinner to see a picture executed by West most admirablyhe has caught the character of our friendsuch goodness is painted in that face that when one looks at it let the soul be ever so much unharmonized it is impossible it should remain soI will send you a set of my booksthey will take with the generalitythe women will read

dearest Lydia  MY Sentimental Journey you say is admired in York by every oneand 'tis not vanity in me to tell you that it is no less admired herebut what is the gratification of my feelings on this

May and if I escape 'twill not be for a long period my childunless a quiet retreat and peace of mind can restore meThe subject of thy letter has astonish'd meShe could but know little of my feelings to tell thee that under the supposition I should survive thy mother I should bequeath thee as a legacy to No my Lydia 'tis a lady whose virtues I wish thee to imitate that I shall entrust my girl toI mean that friend whom I have so often talk'd and wrote aboutfrom her you will learn to be an affectionate wife a tender mother and a sincere friendand you cannot be intimate with her  without her pouring some part of the milk of human kindness into your breast which will serve to check the heat of your own temper which you partake in a small degree ofNor will that amiable woman put my Lydia under the painful necessity to fly to India for protection whilst it is in her power to grant her a more powerful one in EnglandBut I think my Lydia that thy mother will survive medo not deject her spirits with thy apprehensions on my accountI have sent you a necklace buckles and the same to your motherMy girl cannot form a wish that is in the power of her father that he will not gratify her inand  I cannot in justice be less kind to thy motherI am never aloneThe kindness of my friends is ever the sameI wish tho' I had thee to nurse mebut I am deny'd thatWrite to me twice a week at

overjoy'd me by talking a great deal of youDo dear Mrs J entreat him to come tomorrow or next day for perhaps I have not many days or hours to liveI want to ask a favour of him if I find myself worsethat I shall beg of you if in this wrestling I come off conquerormy spirits are fled'tis a bad omendo not weep my dear Ladyyour tears are too precious to shed for mebottle them up and may the cork never be drawnDearest kindest gentlest  and best of women may health peace and happiness prove your handmaidsIf I die cherish the remembrance of me and forget the follies which you so often condemn'dwhich my heart not my head betray'd me into Should my child my Lydia want a mother may I hope you will if she is left parentless take her to your bosomYou are the only woman on earth I can depend upon for such a benevolent actionI wrote to her a fortnight ago and told her what I trust she will find in you Mr J will be a father to herhe will protect her from every insult for he wears a

the good and kind part of the worldAdieuall grateful thanks to you and Mr J  Your poor affectionate friend L STERNE  LETTER CXVII To Mr B  Exeter  July  SIR  THIS was quite an  Impromptu  of Yorick's after he had been thoroughly  soused  He drew it up in a few moments without stopping his pen I should be glad to see it in your intended collection of Mr Sterne's memoirs c If you should have a copy of it you will be able to rectify a misapplication of a term that Mr Sterne could never be guilty of  as one great excellence of his writings lies in the most happy choice of metaphors and allusionssuch as shewed his philosophic judgement at the same time that they displayed his wit and geniusbut it is not for me to comment on or correct so great an original I should have sent this fragment as soon as I saw Mrs Medalle's advertisement had I not been at a distance from my papers I expect much entertainment from this posthumous work of a man to whom no one is more indebted for amusement and instruction than  Sir  Your humble servant S P  AN IMPROMPTU  Nonot one farthing would I give for such a coat in wet weather or dryIf the sun shines you are sure of being melted because it closes so tight about oneif it rains it is no more a defence than a cobweba very sieve o' my conscience that lets through every drop and like many other things that are put on only for a cover mortifies you with disappointment and makes you curse the impostor when it is too late to avail one's self of the discovery Had I been wise I should have examined the claim the coat had to the title of  "defender of the body"  before I had trusted my body in itI should have held it up to the light like other suspicious matters I have seen how much it was likely to admit of that which I wanted to keep outwhether it was no more than such a frail flimsy contexture of flesh and blood as I am fated to carry about with me through every tract of this dirty world could have comfortably and safely dispensed within so short a journeytaking into my account the chance of spreading treesthick hedges o'erhanging the roadwith twenty other coverts that a man may thrust his head underif he is not violently pushed on by that dd stimulusyou know where  that will not let a man sit still in one place for half a minute togetherbut like a young nettlesome tit is eternally on the fret and is for pushing on still fartheror if the poor scared devil is not hunted tantivy by a hue and cry with gives and a halter dangling before his eyesnow in other cases he has not a minute to throw away in standing still but like king Lear must brave  "the peltings of a pitiless storm"  and give heaven leave to  "rumble its belly fullspit fireor spout rain"  as spitefully as it pleaseth without finding the inclination or the resolution to slacken his pace lest something should be lost that might have been gained or more  gotten than he well knows how to get rid ofNow had I acted with as much prudence as some other good folksI could name many of them who have been made bps within my remembrance for having been hooded and muffled up in a larger quantity of this dark drab of mental manufacture than ever fell to my shareand absolutely for nothing elseas will be seen when they are undressed another dayHad I had but as much as might have been taken out of their cloth without lessening much of the size or injuring in the least the shape or contracting aught of the doublings and foldings or continuing to a less circumference the  superb sweep of any one cloak that any one bp ever wrapt himself up inI should never have given this coat a place upon my shoulders I should have seen by the light at one glance how little it would keep out of rain by how little it would keep in of darknessThis a coat for a rainy day do pray madam hold it up to that windowdid you ever see such an  illustrious  coat since the day you could distinguish between a coat and a pair of breechesMy lady did not understand derivatives and so she could not see quite through my splendid pun Pope Sixtus would have blinded her with the same  "darkness of excessive light"  What a flood of  it breaks in thro' this rent what an irradiation beams through that what twinklingswhat sparklings as you wave it before your eyes in the broad face of the sun Make a fan out of it for the ladies to look at their gallants with at churchIt has not served me for one purposeit will serve them for twoThis is coarse stuffof worse manufacture than the clothput it to its proper use for I love when things sort and join wellmake a philtre  This allusion is improper A philtre originally signifies a love potionand it is used as a noun from the verb  philtrate  it must signify a  strainer  not a  sucker  cloth is sometimes used for the purpose of  draining  by means of its pores or capillary tubes but its action is contrary to philtration His meaning is obvious enough but as he drew up this fragment without stopping his pen as I was informed it is no wonder he erred in the application of some of his terms  of itwhile there is a  drop to be extractedI know but one thing in the world that will draw drain or suck like itand that isneither wool nor flaxmakemake any thing of it but a vile hypocritical coat for mefor I never can say  sub Jove  whatever Juno might that  "it is a pleasure to  be wet  "  L STERNE  The FRAGMENT  CHAP I Shewing two Things first what a Rabelaic Fellow LONGINUS RABELAICUS is and secondly how cavalierly he begins his Book  MY dear and thrice reverend brethren as well archbishops and bishops as the  rest  of the inferior clergy would it not be a glorious  thing if any man of genius and capacity amongst us for such a work was fully bent within himself to sit down immediately and compose a thoroughstitch'd system of the KERUKOPAEDIA fairly setting forth to the best of his wit and memory and collecting for that purpose all that is needful to be known and understood of that artOf what art cried PANURGE Good God answered LONGINUS making an exclamation but taking care at the same time to moderate his voice why of the art of making all kinds of your theological hebdodomical rostrummical humdrummical what d'ye call 'emsI will be shot quoth EPISTEMON if  all this story of thine of a roasted horse is simply no more than S Sausages quoth PANURGE Thou hast fallen twelve feet and about five inches below the mark answer'd EPISTEMON for I hold them to be  Sermons  which said word as I take the matter being but a word of low degree for a book of high rhetoricLONGINUS RABELAICUS was foreminded to usher and lead into his dissertation with as much pomp and parade as he could afford and for my own part either I know no more of Latin than my horse or the KERUKOPAEDIA is nothing but the art of making 'emAnd why not quoth GYMNAST of preaching them  when we have doneBelieve me dear souls this is half in halfand if some skilful body would but put us in a way to do this to some  tune  Thou wouldst not have them  chanted  surely quoth TRIBOULET laughingNo nor  canted  neither quoth GYMNAST cryingbut what I mean my friends says LONGINUS RABELAICUS who is certainly one of the greatest criticks in the western world and as Rabelaic a fellow as ever existed what I mean says he interrupting them both and resuming his discourse is this that if all the scatter'd rules of the KERUKOPAEDIA could be but once carefully collected into one code as thick as PANURGE's  head and the whole  cleanly  digestedpooh says Panurge who felt himself aggrieved and bound up continued Longinus by way of a regular institute and then put into the hands of every licensed preacher in Great Britain and Ireland just before he began to compose I maintain itI deny it flatly quoth PANURGEWhat answer'd LONGINUS RABELAICUS with all the temper in the world  CHAP II In which the Reader will begin to form a Judgement of what an Historical Dramatical Anecdotical Allegorical and Comical Kind of a Work he has got hold of  HOMENAS who had to preach next Sunday before God knows whom knowing nothing at all of the matterwas all this while at it as hard as he could drive in the very next roomfor having fouled two clean sheets of his own and being  quite stuck fast in the entrance upon his third general  division  and finding himself unable to get either forwards or backwards with any grace  "Curse it" says he thereby excommunicating every mother's son who should think differently "why may not a man lawfully call in for help in this as well as any other human emergency"  So without any more argumentation except starting up and nimming down from the top shelf but one the second volume of CLARKtho' without any felonious intention in so doing he had begun to clap me in making a joint first five whole pages nine round paragraphs and a dozen and a half of  good thoughts all of a row and because there was a confounded high gallerywas transcribing it away like a little devilNowquoth HOMENAS to himself  "tho' I hold all this to be fair and square yet if I am found out there will be the deuce and all to pay"    Why are the bells ringing backwards you lad what  is  all that crowd about honest man  HOMENAS  was got upon Doctor  CLARK's  back sirand what of that my lad Why an please you he has broke his neck and fractured his skull and befouled himself into the bargain by a fall from the pulpit two stories high  Alas poor HOMENAS HOMENAS has done his businessHOMENAS  will never preach more while breath is in his bodyNo faith I shall never again be able to tickle it off as I have done I may sit up whole winter nights baking my blood with hectic watchings and write as solid as a FATHER of the churchor I may sit down whole summer days evaporating my spirits into the finest thoughts and write as florid as a MOTHER of itIn a word I may compose myself off my legs and preach till I burstand when I have done it will be worse than if not done at all  Pray Mr Suchaone who held forth last Sunday Doctor  CLARK  I trow says one Pray what Doctor  CLARK  says a second  Why  HOMENAS's  Doctor  CLARK  quoth a third  O rare HOMENAS cries a fourth your  servant  Mr HOMENAS quoth a  fifth  'Twill be all over with me by Heav'nI may as well put the book from whence I took itHere HOMENAS burst into a flood of tears which falling down helter skelter ding dong without any kind of intermission for six minutes and almost twenty five seconds had a marvellous effect upon his discourse for the aforesaid tears do you mind did so temper the wind that was rising upon the aforesaid discourse but falling for the most part perpendicularly and hitting the spirits at right angles which were mounting horizontally  all over the surface of his harangue they not only play'd the devil and all with the sublimitybut moreover the said tears by their nitrous quality did so refrigerate precipitate and hurry down to the bottom of his soul all the unsavory particles which lay fermenting as you saw in the middle of his conception that he went on in the coolest and chastest stile for a  soliloquy  I think that ever mortal man uttered  "This is really and truly a very hard case continued HOMENAS to himself"  PANURGE by the bye and all the company in the next room hearing all along every syllable he  spoke for you must know that notwithstanding PANURGE had open'd his mouth as wide as he could for his blood in order to give a round answer to LONGINUS RABELAICUS's interrogation which concluded the last chapteryet HOMENAS's rhetoric had pour'd in so like a torrent slapdash thro' the wainscot amongst them and happening at that  uncritical  crisis when PANURGE had just put his ugly face into the abovesaid posture of defencethat he stopt shorthe did indeed and tho' his head was full of matter and he had screw'd up every nerve and muscle belonging to it till all cryed  crack  again in order to give a due  projectile force to what he was going to let fly full in LONGINUS RABELAICUS's teeth who sat over against himYet for all that he had the continence to contain himself for he stopt short I say without uttering one word except Zdsmany reasons may be assign'd for this but the most true the most strong the most hydrostatical and the most philosophical reason why PANURGE did not go on wasthat the foremention'd  torrent  did so  drown  his voice that he had none left to go on withGod help him poor fellow so he stopt short as I have told you before and all the time HOMENAS was speaking he said not another  word good or bad but stood gaping and staring like what you pleaseso that the break mark'd thuswhich HOMENAS's grief had made in the middle of his discourse which he could no more help than he could flyproduced no other change in the room where LONGINUS RABELAICUS EPISTEMON GYMNAST TRIBOULET and nine or ten more honest blades had got Kerukopaedizing together but that it gave time to GYMNAST to give PANURGE a good squashing chuck under his double chin which PANURGE taking in good part and just as it was meant by GYMNAST he forthwith shut his mouthand gently sitting down upon  a stool though somewhat excentrically and out of neighbours row but listening as all the rest did with might and main they plainly and distinctly heard every syllable of what you will find recorded in the very next chapter
