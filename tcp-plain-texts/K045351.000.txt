 SUCH THINGS ARE A PLAY IN FIVE ACTS AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL COVENT GARDEN BY MRS INCHBALD  LONDON Printed for G G J and J ROBINSON Paternoster Row  MDCCLXXXVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE travels of an Englishman throughout Europe and even in some parts of Asia to soften the sorrows of the Prisoner excited in the mind of the Author the subject of the following pages which formed into a dramatic story have produced from the Theatre a profit far exeeeding the usual pecuniary advantages arising from a successful Comedy  The uncertainty in what part of the East the hero of the present piece was at the time it was written dispensing his benevolence caused the Writer after many researches and objections to fix the scene on the island of Sumatra where the English settlement the system of government and every description of the manners of the people reconcile the incidents of the Play to the strictest degree of probability  PROLOGUE  Written by THOMAS VAUGHAN Esq  Spoken by Mr

Why did not you come over from England exactly sixteen years ago  Lady  Not so long  Sir Luke  Have not we been married the tenth of next April sixteen years  Lady  Not so long  Sir Luke  Did you not come over the year of the great Eclipse answer me that  Lady  I don't remember it  Sir Luke  But I doand shall remember it as long as I livethe first time I saw you was in the garden of the Dutch Envoy you were looking through a glass at the sunI immediately began to make love to you and the whole affair was  settled while the eclipse lastedjust one hour eleven minutes and three seconds  Lady  But what is all this to my age  Sir Luke  Because I know you were at that time near seventeenand without one qualification except your youthand not being a Mullatto  Lady  Sir Luke Sir Luke this is not to be borne  Sir Luke  Oh yesI forgotyou had two letters of recommendation from two great families in England  Lady  Letters of recommendation  Sir Luke  Yes your characterthat you know is all the fortune we poor Englishmen situated in India expect with a wife who crosses the sea at the hazard of her life to make us happy  Lady  And what but our characters would you have us bring Do you suppose any lady ever came to India who brought along with her friends or fortune  Sir Luke  No my dearand what is worseshe seldom leaves them behind either  Lady  No matter Sir Lukebut if I delivered to you a good character  Sir Luke  Yes my dear you didand if you were to ask me for it again I can't say I could give it you  Lady  How uncivil how unlike are your manners to the manners of my Lord Flint  Sir Luke  Ayyou are never so happy as when you have an opportunity of expressing your admiration of hima disagreeable nay a very dangerous manone is never sure of one's self in his presencehe carries every thing he hears to the ministers of our suspicious Sultanand I feel my head shake whenever I am in his company  Lady  How different does his Lordship appear to meto me he is all  politesse  Sir Luke  Politesse  how shou'd you underderstand what is real  politesse  You know your education was very much confined  Lady  And if it  was  confinedI beg Sir Luke you will one time or other cease these reflectionsyou know they are what I can't bear  walks about in a passion  pray does not his Lordship continually assure me I might be taken for a Countess were it not for a certain little groveling toss I have caught with my headand a certain little confined hitch in my walk both which I learnt of  you  learnt by looking so much at  you    Sir Luke  And now if you don't take care by looking so much at his Lordship you may catch some of his defects  Lady  I know of very few he has  Sir Luke  I know of manybesides those he assumes  Lady  Assumes  Sir Luke  Yes do you suppose he is as forgetful as he pretends to be no nobut because he is a favourite with the Sultan and all our great men at court he thinks it genteel or convenient to have no memoryand yet I'll answer for it he has one of the best in the universe  Lady  I don't believe your charge  Sir Luke  Why though he forgets his appointments with his tradesmen did you ever hear of his forgetting to go to court when a place was to be disposed of Did he ever make a blunder and send a bribe to a man out of power Did he ever forget to kneel before the Prince of this Islandor to look in his highness's presence like the statue of Patientresignation in humble expectation  Lady  Dear Sir Luke  Sir Luke  Sent from his own country in his very infancy and brought up in the different  courts of petty arbitrary Princes here in Asia he is the slave of every great man and the tyrant of every poor one  Lady  "Petty Princes"'tis well his highness our Sultan does not hear you  Sir Luke  'Tis well he does notdon't you repeat what I saybut you know how all this fine country is harrassed and laid waste by a set of Princes Sultans as they style themselves and I know not whatwho are for ever calling out to each other "that's mine" and "that's mine"and "you have no business here"and "you have no business there"and "  I  have business every where"  Strutting  then "give  me  this"and "give  me  that" and "take this and take that"  makes signs of fighting  Lady  A very elegant description truly  Sir Luke  Why you know 'tis all matter of factand Lord Flint brought up from his youth amongst these people has not one  trait  of an Englishman about himhe has imbibed all this country's cruelty and I dare say wou'd mind no more seeing me hung up by my thumbsor made to dance upon a redhot gridiron  Lady  That is one of the tortures I never heard ofO I shou'd like to see that of all things  Sir Luke  Yesby keeping this man's company you'll soon be as cruel as he ishe will teach you every vicea consequentialgravedulland yet with that degree of levity that dares to pay his addresses to a woman even before her husband's face  Lady  Did not you say this minute his Lordship had not a  trait  of his own country about him  Sir Luke  Well wellas you say that last  is  a  trait  of his own country  Enter  Servant  and  Lord Flint  Serv  Lord Flint    Exit  Servant  Lady  My Lord I am extremely glad to see youwe were just mentioning your name  Lord  Were you indeed Madam You do me great honour  Sir Luke  No my Lordno great honour  Lord  Pardon me Sir Luke  Sir Luke  But I assure you my Lord what I said did  myself  a great deal of honour  Lady  Yes my Lord and I'll acquaint your Lordship what it was  going up to him  Sir Luke Pulling her aside  Why you wou'd not inform against me sure Do you know what would be the consequence My head must answer it  frightened  Lord  Nay Sir Luke I insist upon knowing  Sir Luke To ber  Hushhushno my Lord pray excuse meyour Lordship perhaps may think what I said did not come trom my heart and I assure you upon my honour it did  Lady  O yesthat I am sure it did  Lord  I am extremely obliged to you  bowing  Sir Luke  O no my Lord not at allnot at all  aside to her  I'll be extremely obliged to  you  if you will hold your tonguePray my Lord are you engaged out to dinner today for her Ladyship and I dine out  Lady  Yes my Lord and we should be happy to find your Lordship of the party  Lord  "Engaged out to dinner"egad very likelyvery likelybut if I amI have positively forgotten where  Lady  We are going to  Lord  NoI think now you put me in mind  of it I think I have company to dine with meI am either going out to dinner or have company to dine with me but I really can't tell whichhowever my people knowbut I can't call to mind  Sir Luke  Perhaps your Lordship  has  dined can you recollect that  Lord  No noI have not dinedwhat's o'clock  Lady  Perhaps my Lord you have not breakfasted  Lord  O yes I've breakfastedI think sobut upon my word these things are very hard to remember  Sir Luke  They are indeed my Lordand I wish all my family wou'd entirely forget them  Lord  What did your Ladyship say was o'clock  Lady  Exactly twelve my Lord  Lord  Bless me I ought to have been some where else thenan absolute engagementI have broke my worda positive appointment  Lady  Shall I send a servant  Lord  No no no noby no meansit can't be helped nowand they know my unfortunate failingbesides I'll beg their pardon and I trust that will be ample satistaction  Lady  You are very good my Lord not to leave us  Lord  I cou'd not think of leaving you so soon Madamthe happiness I enjoy here is  such    Sir Luke  And very likely were your Lordship to go away now you might never recollect to come again  Enter  Servant  Serv  A Gentleman Sir just come from on board an English vessel says he has letters to present to you  Sir Luke  Shew him in    Exit  Servant  He  has brought his character too I supposeand left it  behind  too I suppose  Enter Mr  Twineall  in a fashionable undress  Twi  Sir Luke I have the honour of presenting to you  Gives letters  one from my Lord Clelandone from Sir Thomas Shoestringone from Colonel Fril  Sir Luke Aside  Who in the name of wonder have my friends recommended    reads while Lord  Flint  and the Lady talk apart    Noas I live he is a gentleman and the son of a Lord    going to Lady  Tremor  My dear that is a gentleman notwithstanding his appearancedon't laughbut let me introduce you to him  Lady  A gentleman certainlyI did not look at him beforebut now I can perceive it  Sir Luke  Mr Twineall give me leave to introduce Lady Tremor to you and my Lord Flintthis my Lord is the Honourable Mr Twineall from England who will do me the favour to remain in my house till he is settled to his mind in some post here  They bow  I beg your pardon Sir for the somewhat cool reception Lady Tremor and I gave you at firstbut I dare say her Ladyship was under the same mistake as myselfand I must own I took you at first fight for something very different from the person you prove to befor really no English ships have arrived in this harbour for  these five years past and the dress of us English gentlemen is so much altered fince that time  Twi  But I hope Sir Luke if it is the alteration meets with your approbation  Lady  O to be sureit is extremely elegant and becoming  Sir Luke  Yes my dear I don't doubt but you think so for I remember you used to make your favourite monkey wear just such a jacket when he went out a visiting  Twin  Was he your favourite MadamSir you are very obliging  Bowing to Sir Luke  Sir Luke  My Lord if it were possible for your Lordship to call to your  remembrance  such a trifle  Lady  Dear Sir Luke  Pulling him  Lord  Egad I believe I do call to my remembrance  Gravely considering  Not I assure you Sir that I perceive any great resemblanceor if it was soI dare say it is merely in the dresswhich I must own strikes me as most ridiculousvery ridiculous indeed  Twi  My Lord  Lord  I beg pardon if I have said any thing thatLady Tremor what did I saymake my apology if I have said any thing improperyou know my unhappy failing  Goes up the stage  Lady to Twineall  Sir his Lordship has made a mistake in the word "ridiculous" which I am sure he did not mean to saybut he is apt to make use of one word for anotherhis Lordship has been so long out of England that he may be said in some measure to have forgotten his native language  His Lordship all this time appears consequentially absent  Twi  And you have perfectly explained Madamindeed I ought to have been convinced  without your explanation that if his Lordship made use of the word  ridiculous  even intentionally that the word had now changed its former sense and was become a mode to express satisfactionor his Lordship wou'd not have made use of it in the very forcible manner he did to a perfect stranger  Sir Luke  What Mr Twineall have you new modes new fashions for  words  too in England as well as for dressesand are you equally extravagant in their adoption  Lady  I never heard Sir Luke but that the fashion of words varied as well as the fashion of every thing else  Twi  But what is most extraordinarywe have now a fashion in England of speaking without any words at all  Lady  Pray Sir how is that  Sir Luke  Ay do Mr Twineall teach my wife and I shall be very much obliged to youit will be a great accomplishment Even you my Lord ought to be attentive to this fashion  Twi  Why Madam for instance when a gentleman is asked a question which is either troublesome or improper to answer you don't say you  won't  answer it even though you speak to an inferiorbut you say"really it appears to me eeeee  mutters and shrugs  that ismomomomomo  mutters  if you see the thingfor my partteteteteand that's all I can tell about it at  persent  Sir Luke  And you have told nothing  Twi  Nothing upon earth  Lady  But mayn't one guess what you mean  Twi  O yesperfectly at liberty to guess  Sir Luke  Well I'll be shot if I  could  guess  Twi  And againwhen an impertinent pedant  asks you a question that you know nothing about and it may not be convenient to say soyou answer  boldly  "why really Sir my opinion  is  that the Greek poethehehehe  mutters  weweweweyou seeif his idea wasand if the Latin translatormismismismis  shrugs  that I shou'd thinkin my humble opinionbut the Doctor  may  know better than I"  Sir Luke  The Doctor must know very little else  Twi  Or in case of a duel where one does not care to say who was right or who was wrongyou answer"  This  Sir is the state of the matterMr Fcame firstteteteteon thatbebebebeif the otherin short  whispers  whiswhiswhiswhis"  Sir Luke  What  Twi  There now you have itthere 'tisbut don't say a word about itor if you dodon't say it come from me"  Lady  Why you have not told a word of the story  Twi  But that your auditor must not say to youthat's not the fashionhe never tells you thathe may say"You have not made yourself  perfectly  clear"or he may say" He must have the matter  more particularly  pointed out somewhere else"but that is all the auditor can say with good breeding  Lady  A very pretty method indeed to satisfy one's curiosity  Enter  Servant  Serv  Mr Haswell  Sir Luke  This is a countryman of ours Mr Twineall and a very good man I assure you  Enter  Mr Haswell  Sir Luke  Mr Haswell how do you do  Warmly  Has  Sir Luke I am glad to see youLady Tremor how do you do  He bows to the rest  Lady  O Mr Haswell I am extremely glad you are comehere is a young adventurer just arrived from England who has been giving us such a strange account of all that's going on there  Introducing Twineall  Has  Sir you are welcome to India  Sir Luke whispers Haswell  Indeed  his  son  Lady  Do Mr Haswell talk to himhe can give you great information  Has  I am glad of itI shall then hear many things I am impatient to become acquainted with  Goes up to Twineall  Mr Twineall I have the honour of knowing his Lordship your father extremely wellhe holds his seat in Parliament still I presume  Twi  He does Sir  Has  And your uncle Sir Charles  Twi  Both Sirboth in Parliament still  Has  Pray Sir has any act in behalf of the poor clergy taken place yet  Twi  In behalf of the poor clergy SirI'll tell youl'll tell you SirAs to that actconcerning  shrugs and mutters  ememememthe Committeeememways and meansheeheeI assure you Sirtetete  Sir Luke Lady and Lord Flint laugh  My father and my uncle both think so I assure you  Has  Think  how  Sir  Sir Luke  Nay that's not good breedingyou must ask no more questions  Has  Why not  Sir Luke  Becausewewewewe  mimicks  he knows nothing about it  Has  What Sirnot know  Twi  Yes Sir perfectly acquainted with every thing that passes in the housebut I assure you that when they come to be reportedbut Sir Luke now permit me in my turn to make a few inquiries concerning the state of this country  Sir Luke starts and fixes his eyes suspiciously on Lord Flint  Sir Luke  Why one does not like to speak much about the country one lives inbut Mr Haswell you have been visiting our encampments  you  may tell us what is going on there  Lady  Pray Mr Haswell is it true that the Sultan cut off the head of one of his wives the other day because she said "I won't"  Sir Luke  Do my dear be silent  Lady  I won't  Sir Luke  O that the Sultan had you instead of me  Lady  And with my head off I suppose  Sir Luke  No my dear in that state I shou'd have no objection to you myself  Lady Aside to Sir Luke  Now I'll frighten you ten times moreBut Mr Haswell I am told there are many persons suspected of disaffection to the present Sultan who have been lately by his orders arrested and sold to slavery notwithstanding there was no proof against them produced  Has  Proofin a State such as this the charge is quite sufficient  Sir Luke In apparent agonies wishing to turn  the discourse  Well my Lord and how does your Lordship find yourself this afternoonthis morning I meanBless my soul why I begin to be as forgetful as your Lordship  Smiling and fawning  Lady  How I pity the poor creatures  Sir Luke Aside to Lady  Take care what you say before that tool of statelook at him and tremble for your head  Lady  Look at him and tremble for  yours  and so Mr Haswell all this is trueand some people of consequence too I am told dragged from their homes and sent to slavery merely on suspicion  Has  Yet less do I pity those than some whom prisons and dungeons crammed before are yet prepared to receive  Lord  Mr Haswell such is the Sultan's pleasure  Sir Luke  Will your Lordship take a turn in the garden it looks from this door very pleasantdoes not it  Lady  But pray Mr Haswell has not the Sultan sent for you to attend at his palace this morning  Has  He has Madam  Lady  There I heard he had but Sir Luke said notI am told he thinks himself under the greatest obligations to you  Has  The report has flattered mebut if his highness  shou'd  think himself under obligations I can readily point a way by which he may acquit himself of them  Lady  In the mean time I am sure you feel for those poor sufferers  Has With stifled emotion  Sir Luke good morning to youI call'd upon some trifling business but I have outstaid my time and therefore  fore I'll call again in a couple of hoursLady Tremor good morningmy LordMr Twineall  Bows and exit  Twi  Sir Luke your garden  does  look so divinely beautiful  Sir Luke  Come my Lord will you take a turn in it Come Mr Twineallcome my dear  taking ber hand  I can't think

about  Lord  If you permit me Sir Luke I'll hand the Lady  Sir Luke  Certainly my Lord if you pleasecome Mr Twineall and I'll conduct you  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  An Apartment at Sir  Luke  Tremor's  Enter  Twineall  and  Meanright  Twi  MY dear friend after so long a separation how gland I am to meet youbut how devilish unlucky that you shou'd on the very day of my arrival be going to set sail for another part of the world yet before you go I must beg a favour of youyou know Sir Luke and his family perfectly well I dare say  Mean  I think soI have been in his house near six years  Twi  The very person on earth I wantedSir Luke has power here I supposea word from him might do a man some service perhaps  significantly  Mean  Why yes I don't know a man that has more influence at a certain place  Twin  And her Ladyship seems a very clever gentlewoman  Mean  Very  Twi  And I have a notion they think  me  very clever  Mean  I dare say they do  Twi  Yesbut I mean  very  clever  Mean  No doubt  Twi  But my dear friend you must help me to make them think better of me stilland when  my  fortune is made I'll make  yours  for when I once become acquainted with people's dispositions their little weaknesses foibles and faults I can wind twist twine and get into the corner of every one's heart and lie so snug they can't know I'm there till they want to pull me out and find 'tis impossible  Mean  Excellent talent  Twi  Is not it and now my dear friend do you inform me of the secret dispositions and propensities of every one in this family and of all their connectionsWhat Lady values herself upon one qualification and what Lady upon anotherWhat Gentleman will like to be told of his accomplishments or his daughter'sor of his horses or of his dogsnow my dear Ned acquaint me with all thisand within a fortnight I will become the most necessary rascalnot a creature shall know how to exist without me  Mean  Why such a man as you ought to have made your fortune in England  Twi  Nomy father and my three uncles monopolized all the great men themselves and wou'd never introduce me where I was likely to become their rivalThisthis is the very spot for me to display my geniusBut then I must penetrate the people firstand you will kindly save me that troubleCome give me all their charactersall short all I am to praiseand all I am to avoid praisingin order to endear myself to them  Takes out tablets  Comebegin with Sir Luke  Mean  Sir Lukevalues himself more upon personal bravery than upon any thing else  Twi  Thank you my dear friendthank you  Writes  Was he ever in the army  Mean  Oh yesbesieged a capital fortress a few years agoand now the very name of a battle or a great general tickles his vanity and he takes all the praises you can lavish upon the subject as compliments to himself  Twi  Thank youthank you a thousand times  Writes  I'll mention a battle very soon  Mean  Not directly  Twi  O nolet me alone for time and placego on my friendgo onher Ladyship  Mean  Descended from the ancient kings of Scotland  Twi  You don't say so  Mean  And though she is so nicely scrupulous as never to mention the word genealogy yet I have seen her agitation so great when the advantages of high birth have been extoll'd she could scarcely withhold her sentiments of triumph which in order to disguise she has assumed a disdain for all "vain titlesempty soundsand idle pomp"  Twi  Thank youthank youthis is a most excellent  trait  of the Lady's  Writes  "Pedigree of the kings of Scotland" O I have her at once  Mean  Yet do it nicelyoblique touches rather than open explanations  Twi  Let me alone for that  Mean  She has I know in her possessionbut I dare say she wou'd not show it you nay on the contrary would even  affect  to be highly offended if you were to mention itand yet it certainly would flatter her to know you were acquainted with her having it  Twi  Whatwhatwhat is it  Mean  A large oldfashioned wigwhich Malcolm  the third or fourth her great ancestor wore when he was crowned at Scone in the year  Twi  I'll mention it  Mean  Take care  Twi  O let me alone for the  manner  Mean  She'll pretend to be angry  Twi  That I am prepared forPray who is my Lord Flint  Mean  A deep manand a great favourite at court  Twi  Indeedhow am I to please him  Mean  By insinuations against the  present  Sultan  Twi  How  Mean  With all his pretended attachment his heart  Twi  Are you  sure  of it  Mean  Surehe blinds Sir Luke who by the bye is no great politician but I know his Lordshipand if he thought he was sure of his groundand he thinks he  shall  be sure of it soonthen  Twi  I'll insinuate myself and join his partybut in the mean time preserve good terms with Sir Luke in case any thing shou'd fall in my way thereWho is Mr Haswell  Mean  He pretends to be a man of principle and sentimentflatter him on that  Twi  The easieft thing in the worldno people like flattery better than such as heThey will bear even to hear their  vices  praisedI will myself undertake to praise the vices of a man of sentiment till he shall think them so many virtuesYou have mentioned no Ladies but the Lady of the house yet  Mean  There is no other Lady except a pretty girl who came over from England about two years ago for a husband and not succeeding in another  part of the country is now recommended to this houseand has been here three or four months  Twi  Let me alone to please her  Twi  Let me alone to please her  Mean  YesI believe you are skilled  Twi  For the art of flattery no one more  Mean  But damn itit is not a liberal art  Twi  It is a great science notwithstandingand studied at present by all the connoisseursZounds I have staid a long timeI can't attend to any more characters at presentSir Luke and his Lady will think me inattentive if I don't join themShall I see you againif notI wish you a pleasant voyageI'll make the most of what you have told meyou'll hear I'm a great manGod bless yougood byeyou'll hear I'm a great man  Exit  Mean  And if I am not mistaken I shall hear you are turned out of the house before tomorrow morning O Twineall exactly the  reverse  of every character have you now before youthe greatest misfortune in the  ife of Sir Luke has been flying from his army in the midst of an engagement and a most humiliating degradation in consequence which makes him so feelingly alive on the subject of a battle that nothing but his want of courage can secure my friend Twineall's life for venturing to name the subjectthen Lord Flint firmly  attached  to the  interest  of the Sultan will be all on fire when he hears of open disaffectionbut most of all her Ladyship whose father was a grocer and uncle a noted advertising "Periwigmaker on a new construction" She will run mad to hear of births titles and long pedigreesPoor Twineall little dost thou think what is prepared for theeThere is Mr Haswell toobut to him have I sent you to be reclaimedto himwho free from faults or even foibles  of his own has yet more potently the blessing given of tenderness for ours  Exit  SCENE II  The inside of a Prison  Several Prisoners dispersed in

SCENE I  An Apartment at Sir  Luke  Tremor's  Enter Sir  Luke  and  Aurelia  Sir Luke  WHY then Aurelia though I never mention'd it to my Lady Tremor my friend wrote me word he had reason to suppose your affections were improperly fixed upon a young gentleman in that neighbourhood and this was his reason for wishing you to leave that place to come hitherand this continual dejection convinces me my friend was not mistakenanswer mecan you say he was  Aur  Why then Sir Luke candidly to confess  Sir Luke  Nay no tearswhy in tears for a husband be comfortedwe'll get you one ere long I warrant  Aur  Dear Sir Luke how can you imagine I am in tears because I have not a husband while you see Lady Tremor every day in tears for the very opposite cause  Sir Luke  No matterwomen like a husband through prideand I have known a woman marry from that very motive even a man she has been ashamed of  Aur  Why then I dare say poor Lady Tremor married from pride  Sir Luke  Yesand I'll let her know pride is painful  Aur  But Sir her Ladyship's philosophy  Sir Luke  She has no philosophy  Enter Lady  Tremor  and  Twineall  Sir Luke  Where is his Lordship What have you done with him  Lady  He's speaking a word to Mr Meanright about his passport to EnglandDid you mean me Sir Luke that had no philosophy I protest I have a great deal  Sir Luke  When where did you shew it  Lady  Why when the servant at my Lady Grissei's threw a whole urn of boiling water upon your legs did I give any proofs of female weakness did I faint scream or even shed a tear  Sir Luke  Nonovery trueand while I lay sprawling on the carnet I could see you fanning and holding the smelling bottle to the Lady of the house begging her not to make herself uneasy  for that the accident was of no manner of consequence  Aur  Dear Sir don't be angryI am sure her Ladyship spoke as she thought  Sir Luke  I suppose she did Miss  Aur  I meanshe thought the accident might be easily got the better ofShe thought you might be easily recovered  Lady  No indeed I did notbut I thought Sir Luke had frequently charged me with the want of patience and that moment the very thing in the world I cou'd have wished happenedon purpose to give me an opportunity to prove his accusation false  Sir Luke  Very well Madambut did not the  whole company cry shame on your behaviour did not they say it was not the conduct of a wife  Lady  Only our particular acquaintance cou'd say sofor the rest of the company I am sure did not take me to be your wifethank Heaven our appearances never betray that secretdo you think we look like the same flesh and blood  Sir Luke  That day in particular we did notfor I remember you had been no less than three hours at your toilet  Aur  And indeed Sir Luke if you were to use milk of roses and several other little things of that kind you can't think how much more like a fine gentleman you wou'd lookSuch things as those make almost all the difference there is between you and such a gentleman as Mr Twineall  Twi  No pardon me Madama face like  mine  may use those thingsbut in Sir Luke's they wou'd entirely destroy that fine martial appearance    Sir  Luke  looks confounded    which women as well as men admirefor as valour is the first ornament of  our  sex  Lady  What are you saying Mr Twineall  Aside  I'll keep him on this subject if I can  Twi  I was going to observe Madamthat the reputation of a Generalwhich puts me in mind Sir Luke of an account I read of a battle    He crosses over to Sir  Luke  who turns up the Stage in the utmost confusion and steals out of the room    Lady  Well Sirgo ongo onyou were going to introduce  Twi  A battle Madambut Sir Luke is gone  Lady  Never mind that Sirhe generally runs away on these occasions  Sir Luke Coming back  What were you saying Aurelia about a husband  Lady  She did not speak  Sir Luke  To be sure Ladies in India do get husbands very quick  Twi  Not alwaysI am told Sir LukeWomen of family    fixing his eyes stedfastly on Lady  Tremor  indeed may soon enter into the matrimonial statebut the rich men in India we are told in England are grown lately very particular with whom they marry and there is not a man of any repute that will now look upon a woman as a wife unless she is descended from a good family    Looking at Lady  Tremor  who walks up the Stage and steals off just as Sir  Luke  had done before  Sir Luke  I am very sorryvery sorry to say Mr Twineall that has not been always the case  Twi  Then I am very sorry too Sir Luke for it is as much impossible that a woman who is not born of a good family can be    Lady  Tremor  returns  Sir Luke  That is just what I saythey  cannot  be  Lady  Sir Luke let me tell you  Sir Luke  It does not signify  telling  my dearyou have  proved  it  Lady    To  Twineall  Sir let me tell  you    Twi  O O my dear Madam 'tis all in vainthere is no such thingit can't bethere is no pleading against convictiona person of low birth must in every particular be a terrible creature  Sir Luke Going to her  A terrible creature a terrible creature  Lady  Here comes my Lord FlintI'll appeal to him  Enter Lord  Flint  Sir Luke Going to him  My Lord I was saying as proof that our great Sultan who now fills this throne is no impostor as the rebel party wou'd insinuate no low born man but of the Royal Stock his conduct palpably evincesfor had he not been nobly born we shou'd have beheld the Plebeian bursting forth upon all occasions    Looking at Lady  Tremor  and then Heaven help all those who had had any dealings with him  Lady  Provoking  Goes up the stage  Lord  Sir Luke is there a doubt of the Emperor's birth and title he is the real Sultan depend upon itit surprises me to hear you talk with the smallest uncertainty  Twi  O Sir Luke I wonder at it too    Aside to Lord  Flint  and yet damn me my Lord if I have not my doubts    Lord  Flint  starts  Sir Luke  I  my Lord far be it from me I was only saying what other people said for my part  I  never harboured a doubt of the kind  Aside  My head begins to nod only for that wordpray Heaven I may die with it onI shou'd not like to lose my headnor shou'd I like to die by a bulletnor by a small swordand a cannon ball wou'd be as disagreeable as any thing I knowit is very oddbut I never yet could make up my mind in what manner I shou'd like to go out of the world    During this speech  Twineall  is paying court to Lord  Flint  they come forward and Sir  Luke  retires  Lord  Your temerity astonishes me  Twi  I must own my Lord I feel somewhat aukward in saying it to your Lordshipbut my own heartmy own consciencemy own sentimentsthey  are  my ownand they are dear to  meAnd so it isthe Sultan does not appear to be  With significance  that great man some people think him  Lord  Sir you astonish mepray what is your name I have forgotten it  Twi  Twineall my Lordthe honourable Henry Twineallyour Lordship does me great honour to askarrived this morning from England as your Lordship may rememberin the ship Mercury my Lordand all the officers on board speaking with the highest admiration and warmest terms of your Lordship's official character  Lord  Why then Mr Twineall I am very sorry  Twi  And so am I my Lord that your sentiments and mine shou'd so far disagree as I  know  they doI am not unacquainted with your firm adherence to the Emperorbut I am unused to disguise my thoughtsI cou'd not if I wou'dI have no little viewsno sinister motivesno plotsno intriguesno schemes of prefermentand I verily believe that if a large scymitar was now directed at my heador a large pension directed to my pocketin the first case at least I shou'd speak my mind  Lord Aside  A dangerous young man this and I may make something of the discovery  Twi Aside  It tickles him to the soul I findMy Lord now I begin to be warm on the subject I feel myself quite agitatedand from the intelligence which I have heard even when I was in Englandthere is every reason to supposeexmexmexm  Mutters  Lord  What Sir what  Twi  You understand me  Lord  No Sirexplain  Twi  Why then there is every reason to supposesome people are not what they shou'd bepardon my thoughts if they are wrong  Lord  I  do  pardon your thoughts with all my heartbut your words young man must be answer'd for  Aside  Lady Tremor good morning  Twi Aside  He is going to ruminate on my sentiments I dare say  Lady  Shall we have your Lordship's company towards the evening Mr Haswell will be here if your Lordship has no objection  Sir Luke  How do you know Mr Haswell will be here  Lady  Because he has just called in his way to the Palace and said soand he has been telling us some very interesting stories too  Sir Luke  Of his moring visits I supposeI heard Meanright say he saw him very busy  Lady  Sir Luke and I dine out my Lord but we shall return early in the evening  Lord  I will be here without failSir Luke aword with you if you please  They come forward  Mr Twineall has taken some very improper liberties with the Sultan's name and I must insist on making him answer for it  Sir Luke  My Lord you are extremely welcome  Trembling  to do whatever your Lordship pleases with any one belonging to me or to my housebut I hope your Lordship will pay some regard to the master of it  Lord  O great regard to the masterand to the mistress alsoBut for that gentleman  Sir Luke  Do  what  your Lordship pleases  Lord  I willand I will make him  Sir Luke  If your Lordship does not forget it  Lord  I shan't forget it Sir LukeI have a very good memory when I please  Sir Luke  I don't in the least doubt it my LordI never did doubt it  Lord  And I can be very severe too Sir Luke when I please  Sir Luke  I don't in the least doubt it my LordI never did doubt it  Lord  You may depend upon seeing me here in the eveningand then you shall find I have not threatened more than I mean to performgood morning  Sir Luke  Good morning my LordI don't in the least doubt it    Exit Lord  Flint  Lady Coming forward with  Twineall  For Heaven's sake Mr Twineall what has birth to do with  Twi  It has to do with  every thing  Madameven with beautyand I wish I may suffer death if a woman with all the mental and personal accomplishments of the finest creature in Europe wou'd to me be of that value  Snapping his finger  if lowly born  Sir Luke  And I sincerely wish every man who visits me was of the same opinion  Aur  For shame Mr Twineall persons of mean birth ought not to be despised for what it was not in their power to preventand if it is a misfortune you shou'd consider them only as objects of pity  Twi  And so I do pity themand so I domost sincerelypoor creatures    Looking on Lady  Tremor  Sir Luke  Aye now he has mended it finely  Lady  Mr Twineall let me tell you  Sir Luke  My dearLady Tremor  Taking her aside  let him alonelet him go onthere is something preparing for him he little expectsso let the poor man say and do what he pleases for the presentit won't last longfor he has offended  my Lord Flint and I dare say his Lordship will be able upon some account or another to get him imprisoned for life  Lady  Imprisoned Why not take off his head at once  Sir Luke  Well my dearI am sure I have no objectionand I dare say my Lord will have it done to oblige youEgad I must make friends with her to keep mine safe  Aside  Lady  Do you mean to take him out to dinner with us  Sir Luke  Yes my dear if you approve of itnot else  Lady  You are grown extremely polite  Sir Luke  Yes my dear his Lordship has taught me how to be politeMr Twineall Lady Tremor and I are going to prepare for our visit and I will send a servant to shew you to your apartment in order to dress for you will favour us with your company I hope  Twi  Certainly Sir Luke I shall do myself the honour  Lady  Come this way Aurelia I can't bear to look at him    Exit with  Aurelia  Sir Luke  Nor I to  think  of him  Exit  Twi  If I have not settled my business in this family I am mistakenthey seem to have but one mind about meDevilish clever fellow egadI am the man to send into the worldsuch a volatile goodlooking scoundrel too No one suspects meto be sure I am under some few obligations to my friend for letting me into the different characters of the familyand yet I don't know whether I am obliged to him or notfor if he had not made me acquainted with themI shou'd soon have had the skill to find them out myshelfNo I will not think myshelf under any  obligation to himit is devilish inconvenient for a gentleman to be under an obligation  Exit  SCENE II  The Place The Sultan discovered

to be any one sitting in judgement  Has  Tell it to me SirI will report it  Sir Luke  Why then Mr Haswell as Ghosts sometimes walkand as one's conscience is sometimes troublesomeI think Mr Twineall has done nothing to merit death and the charge which his Lordship sent in against him we begin to think too severebut if there was any false statement  Lord  It was the fault of my not charging my  memoryany error I have been guilty of must be laid to the fault of my total want of memory  Has  And what do you hope from this confesfion  Sir Luke  To remit the prisoner's punishment of death to something less if the Sultan will please to annul the sentence  Lord  Yesand grant ten or twelve years imprisonmentor the Gallies for fourteen yearsor  Sir Luke  Ay ay something in that way  Has  For shamefor shameGentlementthe extreme rigour you shew in punishing a dissension from your opinion or a satire upon your folly proves to conviction what reward you had bestowed upon the  skilful  flatterer  Twi  Gentlemen and Ladies pray why wou'd you wish me requited with such extreme severity merely for my humble endeavours to make myself agreeableLady Tremor upon my honour I was credibly informed your ancestors were Kings of Scotland  Lady  Impossibleyou might as well say that you heard Sir Luke had distinguished himself at the battle of  Twi  And I  did  hear so  Lady  And he  did  distinguish himself for he was the only one that ran away  Twi  Cou'd it happen  Lady  Yes Sir it did happen  Sir Luke  And go  you  Mr Twineall into a field of battle and I think it is very likely to happen again  Lord  If Mr Haswell has obtained your pardon Sir it is all very wellbut let me advise you to keep your sentiments on politics to yourself  for the futureas you value that pretty head of

freedom to your father and youself the Sultan restores his forfeited landsand might I plead Sir Luke for your interest with Aureila's friends this young man's filial love shou'd be repaid by conjugal affection  Sir Luke  As for that Mr Haswell you have so much interest at court that your taking the young man under you protectionbesides as Aurelia was sent hither merely to get a husbandI don't see  Aur  True Sir Lukeand I am afraid my father and mother will begin to be uneasy that I have not got one yetand I shou'd be very sorry to disobligethem  Elv  Nosay rather sorry to make me wretched

a mind superior even to the love of fameneither can they through malice suffer by applause since they are too sacred to incite envy and must conciliate the respect the love and the admiration of all  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Written by MILESPETER ANDREWS Esq  Spoken by Mrs MATTOCKS  SINCE all are sprung they say from Mother Earth  Why stamp a merit or disgrace on birth  Yet so it is however we disguise it  All boast their origin or else despise it  This pride or shame haunts ev'ry living soul  From Hydepark Corner down to Limehouse Hole  Peers taylors poets statesmen undertakers  Knights squires manmilliners and perukemakers  Sir Hugh Glengluthglin  from the land of goats  Tho' out at elbows shews you all his coats  And rightful heir to  twenty pounds  per annum  Boasts the rich blood that warm'd his great great grannam  While wealthy Simon Soapsuds just beknighted  Struck with the sword of state is grown dim sighted  Forgets the neighbouring chins he used to lather  And scarecely knows he ever had a father  Our Author then correct in every line  From nature's characters hath pictur'd mine  For many a lofty fair who friz'd and curl'd  With crest of horse hair tow'ring thro' the world  To powder paste and pins ungrateful grown  Thinks the full periwig is all her own  Proud of her conquering ringlets onward goes  Nor thanks the barber from whose hands she rose  Thus doth false pride fantastic minds mislead  And make our weaker sex seem weak indeed  Suppose to prove this truth in mirthful strain  We bring the  Dripping family  again  Papa a tallow chandler by descent  Had read "how  larning  is most excellent"  So Miss returned from boarding school at Bow  Waits to be finished by Mama and Co  "  See spouse how spruce our Nan is grown and tall    "  I'll lay she cuts a dash at Lord Mayor's ball  "  In bolts the maid"  Ma'am Miss's master's come  "  Away fly Ma' and Miss to dancing room  "  Walk in Mounseer come  Nan  draw up like me  "  "  Ma fo  Madame Miss like you as two pea  "  Mounseer takes out his kit the scene begins  Miss trusses up my lady Mother grins  "  Ma'amselle me teach a you de step to tread  "  First turn you toe den turn you littel bead  "  One two dree sinka risa balance bon  "  Now entrechat and new de cotillon  Singing and dancing about  "  Pardieu Ma'amselle be one enchanting girl    "  Me no surprise to see her ved an Earl  "  "  With all my heart says Miss Mounseer I'm ready    "  I dream'd last night Ma I should be a Lady  "  Thus do the  Drippings  all important grown  Expect to shine with lustre not their own  New airs are got fresh graces and fresh washes  New caps new gauze new feathers and new sashes  Till just complete for conquest at Guildhall  Down comes an order to suspend the ball  Miss Shrieks Ma' scolds Pa' seems to have lost his tether  Caps custards coronetsall sink together  Papa resumes his jacket dips away  And Miss lives single till next Lord Mayor's day  If such the  sorrow  and if such the strife  That break the comforts of domestic life  Look to the hero who this night appears  Whose boundless excellence the World reveres  Who friend to nature by no blood confin'd  Is the glad relative of all mankind
