Hone Thicket Plunder Birch  and  Latitat  GLEE  SWEETLY sweetly let's enjoy  The smiling moments made for love  And while we clasp the dimpled boy  The glass to you to you shall move  And drinking laughing jesting neatly  The time shall pass on sweetlysweetly  Love's arrows dipp'd in rosy wine  To the charm'd heart like light'ning pass  Aud Mars feels transport more divine  When smiling Venus fills his glass  Live  That's right my ladswe may boast and chatter of our prowesses but love is the only goal for which we start upon the course of honourwithout love our laurels would be but in a wither'd condition and I'll bett all the world to a corn of powder that he goes nearest to the mouth of a cannon who has some mistress to brag of his exploits to when he returns home  Flint  Bravo Livelyyou and the old song say the very same thing Give it us my boy  Live  With all my heart in the mean time take care of this old gentleman here  AIR  Brother soldiers why cast down  Never boys be melancholy  You say our lives are not our own  But therefore should we not be jolly  This poor tenement at best  Depends on fickle chance Mean while  Drink laugh and sing and for the rest  We'll boldly brave each rude campaign  Secure if we return again  Our pretty landlady shall smile  II  Fortune his life and yours commands  And this moment should it please her  To require it at your hands  You can but die and so did Caesar  Our span though long were little worth  Did we not time with joy beguile  Laugh then the while you stay on earth  And boldly brave c  III  Life's a debt we all must pay  'Tis so much pleasure which we borrow  Nor heeds if on a distant day  It is demanded or tomorrow  The bottle says we're tardy grown  Do not the time and liquor spoil  Laugh out the little life you own  And boldly c  Flint  Thank ye Lively thank youCome old gentlemansay here's to you  Plun  to  Rifleman  Why lord I tell you they knows no more about the respect due to us Gentlemen Soldierswhy damme they thinks us fit for nothing but a cato'nine tails and to be hired out and shot at for fivepence a day  Rif  Why that's true as you say Plunder but then who have we to thank for itour superiorsMerit is not  rewardedCome my lads here's confusion to the first inventor of jumping over heads For my part I say little but if I had been rewarded as I ought for my behaviour in that there scrimmageWhy now I suppose you have heard of poor old Blenheim  Live  Heard of himhe is one of the disgraces of his country There is no general to whom I would pay more respect descended from an antient family he inherired only a brown musket and after having distinguished himself in most of the Great Duke of Marlborough's▪ wars with a bravery the admiration of every one is at the age of sixtyfive nobly rewarded by a brevet for Chelsea Hospital whither I am told he is now on his way and where his wife a washerwoman and his daughter a seamstress are waiting his arrival  Plun  Poor old BlenheimWhy do you think if as how I had been a general and Blenheim had served under me that I would have broke his poor old heart by putting a parcel of boys before him because one was my Lord this thing's footman and t'other carried my Lady that thing's lap dog  Thick  Why to be sure there must be something wrong going on but for my part if they did not tax dogs and horses and servants and enclose commons they might do what they pleased for ought I cared What do you say old Pedagogue  Birch  Why Squire I say what I have said a hundred times that your great people should all be sent to school  Lat  Why to be sure if they would sue out a writ of discretion and join issue with common sense they would be more likely to get a favourable verdict from their countryen't I right master Barber  Hone  Why I'll tell you whatI thinks if as why I may speak the truth that we are all of us shaved too close▪  Plun  You think old Periwigfor me if I was commanding officer about and concerning the affairs of this nation every rank and file should be made either colonel or general  Live  Come come you are too violent those at the head of affairs know when and how to manage matters a devilish deal better than you can dictate to them  Plun  Manage matters why I tell you their promotions are interest their manoeuvres ignorance and their camps parties of pleasure  Blen  Ha ha ha  Live  You seem my old friend to find something pleasant in our conversation  Blen  PleasantPardon me Sir not very pleasant but light and airy as may be expected at your time of lifeYou seem to govern the nation over your bottle and to amend the state and legislature at every bumper you contend that others are neglected that you are neglected yourselves This is a partial evil not to be lamented and if you are soldiers you ought to be ashamed of such paltry considerations  Live  In your days my friend this might be good doctrine for aught I know but now the case is altered and every man thinks only of his own interest  Blen  So much the worse and if the case is altered you are properly requited neglect ought to be your portion  Live  How's this do you insult us in return for our hospitality  Blen  Far from it I deal with you as a friend and pay you with honest truth for the shelter you afford me  Live  There is something like wisdom in your remarks old gentleman but mix'd I think with rather too much spleen This public spirit which you require is certainly a virtue but by no means a duty  Blen  In your station 'tis a dutythe very foundation of every military virtueWhoever dedicates himself to the service of his country should consider his country unable to requite his services for in fact that which he devotes to the public good is above all priceNo more of these complaints then'Tis unavoidable in counties like ours that bravery must sometimes fall into neglect otherwise there would be no subordination for how could you reward as you ought an English army unless every one could command in chief  Live  And pray who are you that talk to us in that stile  Blen  Blenheim  All  Blenheim  Blen  Blenheimthat poor old Chelsea Pensioner for whom but now you seemed to have so much compassion  Live  And can you who have been treated so ungratefully inculcate the principles of public virtue and disinterested love of our country  Blen  From whom then do you expect to hear your dutyfrom these gentlemen who never saw fire but in the corner of a chimney 'Tis true I have been wrong'd neglected taken up imprisoned accused of violating the  King's rights in the very moment I protected them and that by the very man whose life I saved in battle he who is possessed of a considerable place in the revenues while I am groveling in this abject condition but what signifies all this the actions of my life may be effaced from the memory of a Court but the memory of mankind will be more retentive and if it should not I have the conscious remembrance and that is sufficient  Thick  A queer old codger thisCome my honest fellows I believe the skittle pins wait for us good bye old rugged and tough we'll come and smoke a pipe with you at Chelsea  Plund  Come Lively let us go and see what recruits we can pick up at Wandsworth Fair  Live  March on Corporal  GLEE  With mingled sound of drum and fife  We follow the recruiting life  And as we march through every fair  Make girls admire and bumkins stare  With bumpers full we ply Sir Clown  Or else produce the welltim'd crown  And listing first the sturdy elves  We gain their sweethearts for ourselves  Blenheim  and  Lively  Live  Now they are gone how can I serve youdo you want money  Blen  No young man I thank thee I have wherewithal to conduct me to my last retreat  Live  What a retreat for such meritIt makes me look with horror on my country and blush for every drop of blood I've spilt in her cause  Blen  For shame distinguish better my wrongs  Live  Are a scandal to the nation and by Heaven I'd strangle the villain  Blen  My poor lad thy compassion is folly when thou shalt have strangled all the world will it give me the use of this arm or make me a day younger  Live  Nobut it would teach such miscreants how to use others  Blen  And by what title do you pretend to execute my revengeHave I transferred to you a right I do not myself possessNo my good young manIf I would have revenged myself half a regiment would have deserted under my command but I am resigned to my fate imitate my example and allow me to be a judge of what is right and honourable  Live  At least point me out your enemies that I may hate them  Blen  Nay let your children hate them let them imbibe from their very infancy a detestation for them  Live  They shallwho are they  Blen  The enemies of my country  AIR  If deep thy poignard thou would'st drench  In blood to venge old  Blenheim  's woes  My enemies boy are the  French  And all who are my country's foes  Shall I receive an added day  Of life when crimes your name shall brand  No never let detraction say  That virtue arm'd a murderer's hand  Of anger then no single breath  Respire for my poor sakebut since  You've spirit to encounter death  Die for your country and your prince  Lively  and  Plunder  Plun  Come serjeant the men are all expecting you there are a fine parcel of raw country fellows and one animating speech at the drum head makes them our own my boy  Live  Plunder can we spare one of the men to conduct old Blenheim to Chelsea  Plun  Fire old Blenheim we have no time to consider about invalids  Live  Come Plunder thou art an honest fellow thy fortune has a similitude to mine the only difference is thou ran'st away and took up a musket after ruining a poor old mother whilst I entered in the guards after being turn'd out of doors by a rich old father  Plun  Well lad what of this  Live  I'll tell thee what of this as thou art my Pylades I must needs entrust thee with my secretsI love this old fellow nay more I love his daughter  Plun  Oh oh you do  Live  Ay you rogue and I have some reason to believe I am not altogether disagreeable to her  Plun  And do you expect governor Lively will ever consent that his son should marry the daughter of an old Chelsea Pensioner  Live  If he does not I'll discard him as he has me and chuse the old Chelsea Pensioner as the best father of the twobut however I am not without hopesthou know'st what a perfect veneration my father has for every military relict and I think if I was to throw myself at his feet plead Blenheim's cause and my own at the same time▪ I could get the old invalid a good employ myself reinstated into his favour▪ and thee a commissionCome alongI'll first to my dutythat discharged I'll fly to comfort my Nancy and then to throw myself at the feet of my father  Jew's Row  Chelsea  with a poor looking House in the Front  Lapstone  is working in a Stall underneath the Window  Ester  is ironing withinside the Window open and  Nancy  sits on a Bench at the Door making a Shirt  TRIO  Neighbour neighbour  Work away  What like labour  Makes us gay  The world is sad  It knows not why  Your poets in rhimes  May rail at the times  But since they're so bad  And no cure's to be had  'Tis better to laugh than to cry  But look behind  And you shall find  For one poor pleasure plagues a score  Nor is I fear  One whit more clear  The prospect should you look before  Then far beyond blind fortune's power  Live and enjoy the present hour  Laps  Why Mistress Ester your good man makes it rather late it begins to draw towards the heel of the evening  Es  I wonder indeed he does not come tho' to say the truth I am glad he staid till I had done my ironing for if I get the money where I am to carry home these things we'll have a comfortable bit of something for supper  Laps  So we will Mrs Ester I am sure I shall make one with more pleasure than ever I did at a fe  st upon St Crispin's day besides who knows if we should wax merry but the thread of our discourse may turn upon my love for Miss Nancydear me I should be at home to a peg  Est  I'll speak a good word for thee neighbour Lapstone never fearwhat dost thee say daughter to our old friend  Nan  Indeed mother his being our old friend is no very strong recommendation to me  Est  No I warrant you you can't get your fine serjeant out of your headone would imagine your mother's example was enough to frighten you from ever thinking of a red coat  Nan  I am sure mother I have heard you say a hundred times that with all your troubles you could live the same life over again for the love of my father  Est  So I could child so I could and be happy enough in the main I can safely swear in all our marches dustings and famishings abed early abed late I never was the woman that said a crossgrain'd word to him  Nan  What makes you so averse then to my partiality for the serjeant  Est  Why child 'tis all along of his father that we have been brought to misfortunes  Laps  Yes Miss I do assure you 'tis very true when Pensioner Malplaquet came yesterday to have his shoe heeltapped for 'tis tore out already though he has had it but five months however that's not very marvellous the Contractors give the poor Pensioners bad beer or any thing now adays a fault somewhere to be sure there is I wish it could be enquired outbut as I was a saying Pensioner Malplaquet knows the goodlooking young Serjeant that comes after youyou knows who I mean he that makes me prick my fingers with my awl so often for vexation And he says that he is the only child of Governor Lively now Governor Lively is the gentleman that was the cause how and consarning your father's being taken up for a smugger  Est  And what a barbarous villain he must be when all the world knows your father lost the use of his arm by saving the old rogue's life at the battle of Fontenoy  Nan  Then make yourself easy mother for the author of any misfortune to my father shall never impress me with one favourable sentiment  Est  How prettily she talks it neighbour▪  Laps  Sharp as a pairingknife  Est  Neighbour Lapstone suppose you was to go towards Battersea bridge and try to meet my old man while I carry this ironing homeAs to thee daughter I shall never consent to make thee unhappy and I trust thou hast duty enough never to make me so or thy poor father and as to the rest if thou refusest our good neighbour here only because he is poor I can tell thee wench as there is no station ever so high but has its bitters so there is no station ever so low but has its weets  AIR  The world's a strange world child it must be confess'd  We all of distress have our share  But since I must struggle to live with the rest  By my troth 'tis no great matter where  We all must put up with what fortune has sent  Be therefore one's lot poor or rich  So there is but a portion of ease and content  By my troth 'tis no great matter which  II  A living's a living and so there's an end  If one honestly gets just enow  And something to spare for the wants of a friend  By my troth 'tis no great matter how  In this world about nothing we busied appear  And I've said it again and again  Since quit it one must if one's conscience is clear  By my troth 'tis no great matter when  Exit  Lapstone  and  Nancy  Laps  So Miss it seems I shall never be able to get the length of your foot  Nan  I am afraid not  Laps  What I suppose you can't buckle too then  Nan  I cannot indeed  Laps  And pray Miss med a body ax why  Nan  I have many reasons which you can't possibly guess  Laps  Why to be sure nobody knows where the shoe pinches so well as them that wears it  Nan  In the first place you are not my choice  Laps  Why Miss that's true but a readymade shoe sometimes fits as well as a bespoke one  Nan  Then there is such a disproportion in our ages that I am sure  Laps  What you thinks if we were to be married together it would be all one as if I was to clap an old sole to a new upperleather  Nan  And how do you think we should agree then  Laps  Why for all the world like John and Jean in the old ballad  Nan  What that you sing sometimes in your stall  Laps  Yes Miss  Nan  I wish you'd sing it'twould divert me  Laps  Why Miss I ought to be going towards Bat tersea bridge but I am sure I would do any thing to divert you  AIR  Sing the loves of John and Jean  Sing the loves of Jean and John  John for her would leave a queen  Jean for him the noblest Don  She's his queen  He's her Don  John loves Jean  And Jean loves John  II  Whate'er rejoices happy Jean  Is sure to burst the sides of John  Does she for grief look thin and lean  He instantly is pale and wan  Thin and lean  Pale and wan  John loves Jean  And Jean loves John  III  'Twas the lily hand of Jean  Fill'd the glass of happy John  And heavens how joyful was she seen  When he was for a licence gone  Joyful seen  They'll dance anon  For John weds Jean  And Jean weds John  IV  John has ta'en to wife his Jean  Jean's become the spouse of John  She no longer is his queen  He no longer is her Don  No more queen  No more Don  John hates Jean  And Jean hates John  V  Whatever 'tis that pleases Jean  Is certain now to displease John  With scolding they're grown thin and lean  With spleen and spite they're pale and wan  Thin and lean  Pale and wan  John hates Jean  And Jean hates John  VI  John prays Heav'n to take his Jean  Jean at the devil wishes John  He'll dancing on her grave be seen  She'll laugh when he is dead and gone  They'll gay be seen  Dead and gone  For John hates Jean  And Jean hates John  Exit  Enter Lively  Live  Here she is by heaven and alonemy dear Nancy I flew to you for a single moment to inform you  Nan  Sir I have received sufficient information in your absence to determine me never to hear you upon any subject again  Live  How  Nan  I know who you are Sirwhy you concealed your real name and family from mePerhaps you and your father were not to be satisfied till the ruin of the daughter was added to the ruin of the father  Live  By heaven I have not the most distant conception of what you mean I swear to you my intentions in relation to you proceed from the purest and most disinterested affection  Nan  Are you not the son of governor Lively  Live  I am  Nan  That oppressor of innocence that tyrant who sought to destroy his very preserver  Liv  No let me defend himtho' he has discarded me driven me an alien from his house I deserved it all and assumed another name only that I might not be a reproach to himnor did I ever know him capable of an injusticewhat would you insinuate thenwhat preserver do you mean  Nan  My father who saved his life  Live  Your fatherstayit must be soour conversation every thing confirms itbut I'll answer with my life whatever injustice poor Blenheim has suffered my father is unconscious of the causenay I have often heard him declare he would load the old soldier with favours who saved his life at Fontenoythis is delightful I'll fly to him this instant  Nan  Thou art a worthy youthforgive my rashness  Live  Thy fault was as thou art amiable to perfectionI gowhen shall I return and demand thee of thy father  Nan  AIR  When thou shalt see his bosom swelling  When soft compassion's tear shall start  As my poor father's woes thou'rt telling  Come back and claim my hand and heart  The cause blest eloquence will lend thee  Nay haste and ease my soul's distress  To judge thy worth I'll here attend thee  And rate thy love by thy success  Enter  Blenheim  and  Lapstone  Live  Suffer me to speak one word to your father and I'll awayhere he comes take no notice that you know who I am nor let your mother  Laps  Come along neighbour  Blen  Ah my daughter  Nan  My dear fatherhow we have wished for you  Blen  Where's thy poor mother  Nan  I expect her every moment  Blen  Ah young man  Live  I took the liberty of coming to prepare your family for your reception and once more to know if my friendship can be serviceable to youpoor as my situation isI have a relation powerful enough to redress your wrongs suffer him to receive an account of them tomorrow from your own mouth  Blen  Thy friendship I accept with all my heart young manI have a regard for youth in that happy season the heart is unhackney'd in the ways of men besides thou art a good lad and hast many excellent sentiments and as thou art pursuing the road to glory my advice may perhaps assist thee  During the above speech Ester comes and Nancy instructs her by signs to take no notice of Lively  Est  Ah my dear old man and so thou'rt come home at lastand how dost  Blen  Not quite so young as formerly good wife but as sincere believe mecome young man wilt thou partake a poor supper with us  Live  My duty calls me henceI'll see you tomorrow and I hope with good news  FINALE  Nancy  Good night good night thou noble youth  And if thy tenderness and truth  Should a propitious influence need  To make thy generous views succeed  From grief to set my father free  Oh for a moment think of me  Oh for c c  Lively  Good night good night the chearful hour  If sad remembrance e'er should sour  If as the joyful glass goes round  One single drop of care be found  Your cup from the intruder free  And for a moment think of me  And for c c  Ester  Good night good night try all you can  To serve I pray you my good man  His fortune has been very rough  But if his griefs are not enough  To melt your heart and set him free  Oh for a moment think of me  Oh for c c  Blenheim  Good night good night and if henceforth  Thou see'st proud vice neglected worth  Abuse of power perverted laws  Bad mens prosperity the cause  And art from indignation free  Oh for a moment think of me  Oh for c c  CHORUS  Good night good night and when henceforth  I see proud vice neglected worth  Abuse of power perverted laws  Bad men's prosperity the cause  And am from indignation free  I'll sigh and then I'll think of thee  I'll sigh c c  End of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  A Part of  Chelsea  Hospital  Blenheim  sitting on a Bencha March is heard and after it a Discharge of Musquetry  Blen  THE inhabitants of this hospitalble asylum are consigning one of their companions to the earth while the goodnatured neighbours flock around and with an honest grief regard the old veterans whose eyes are swollen at the remembrance of that time when young and lusty they sought glory in the field with the present object of their concernGenerous griefIt becomes the natives of this beneficent country for of all the tributes due to worth there's none so graceful or so noble as the tear that bedews the grave of a soldierbut the ceremony is at an end and here they come  Enter  Malplaquet Platoon Pensioners  and  Blneheim  Mal  Ah poor fellow 'tis all over with him sure enoughwell we have not buried him all for he left behind him at the battle of Hockstet as good a leg and as fine an arm as ever mounted a breach or poized a firelock  Plat  Well he was a noble fine fellow  Mal  Ah I shall never forget before the breath went out of his bodyhe called me to himsays he you  see Malplaquet what a campaign I am going to makegive me some ammunition to take with me my boyso with that I gave him the guzzle he drank a good swig shook me by the hand cried damme good bye and went off like a sucking babeAh 'twill be my turn next  Drinks  Plat  Come come don't take it so to heart  Mal  There was a time to be surewe had our day once that nobody can denybut now we are as useless as so many broke up mortars or spiked cannonah we are fit for nothing now but to drink and talk of what we could do formerly  Plat  Drinkwell and what can we do betterwon't you take a sup with us brother  Blen  With all my heart  GLEE  Tell me neighbour tell me plain  Which is the best employ  Is it love whose very pain  They say is perfect joy  Is it war whose thund'ring sound  Is heard at such a distance round  Is it to have the miser's hoard  Is it to be with learning stor'd  Is it gay Pegasus to rein  Tell me neighbour tell me plain  No no will answer every honest soul  The best employ's to push about the bowl  At the end of the Glee the Pensioners go off leaving Blenheim  Blenheim  and  Lapstone  Blen  Who have we here  Laps  Why 'tis I  Blen  You friend Lapstone and how came you so metamorphosed  Laps  Why you know you was saying last night at supper that you should like to marry your daughter to a soldier and so what does I doI borrows the dead gentleman pensioner's coat to ask you how I looks in itdon't you think I have a good milantary air  Blen  Admirablebut I should think your joints as well as mine are not very supple  Laps  Oh Lord you don't know how lissom I be Mr Manoeuvre the drill serjeant in the Park tells me that with a little treading upon my toes and cudgelling over the shoulders he is sure in a week he could make me turn out in the linebesides we ought all to go for soldiers now  Blen  Ay why now friend Lapstone  Laps  Why I am creditably informed that the French are determined this summer to evade us in four placesThey are to make a retreat in Cornwall embark a large body of troops upon the coast of Ireland throw succours into Portsmouth harbour and take a diversion upon the Thames  Blen  Indeed  Laps  Nay moreThey are to set fire to all the shipping in the river knock down the Tower and surprize the Lord Mayor as he goes a swanhopping  Blen  Why indeed this business is enough to surprize any bodyBut still I think you and I can do but little service we are too old  Laps  OldWhy Lord love you I am but sixty oneto be sure they scratched me off the list for malicious men upon the church door  Blen  Well friend Lapstone if I were to counsel you while others serve their country in the field you should endeavour to be useful to it in your stall  AIR  Awhile in every nation  War may blaze around  Still spreading desolation  Yet there's hopes of peace  Awhile the billows raging  May sky and sea confound  Yet winds and waves asswaging  Storms at last will cease  But man thus overtaken  A tempest in his mind  His warring passions shaken  Are reeds as in the wind  Rare is the eloquence that has the charm  To rule that pestilence or quell the storm  Lapstone  alone  Laps  I' cod I believe he's rightif I get wounded with my pairing knife or my awl I have no occasion for a surgeon to cure me I can't say so much for a bayonet or a firelockno I'm determinedI'll visit no redevouses but houses of call nor think about quarters except to cobble 'em  AIR  'Twere better I took your advice my good neighbour  My conduct henceforward I'll mend  With joy and content to my last will I labour  Still striving to make a good end  And then as to love I'll ne'er think of a woman  I will not I swear it by goles  But like methodist preachers on Kennington Common  I'll live by mending of soles  II  Many battles I'll fighto'er a pot of good porter  Whole armies I'll killin my stall  To no soulof a shoe will I ever give quarter  And what hides will I piercewith my awl  And then as to love c  Enter  Governor  and  Lively  Gov  I hope he won't know me in this disguise I should fain hear his story without discovering myself it will be told with more ingenuity and I shall hear it with less confusionFor thee Frederick thou hast so pleased me that if this appears as thou hast related it I'll forgive thee every thing  Live  Sir your eagerness ever to do justice prompted what I have done in the relation of which you'll find I have been faithful  Gov  But how came your intimacy with the daughter  Live  Passing frequently Sir this way I continually noticed her at some industrious employment I enquired who she was got introduced and loved her but though her person and conversation won my very soul yet these were nothing in my esteem compared with the unparalleled affection for her father  AIR  'Twas not her eyes though orient mines  Can boast no gem so bright that glows  Her lips where the deep ruby shines  Her cheeks that shame the blushing rose  Nor yet her form Minerva's mien  Her bosom white as Venus dove  That made her my affection's queen  But 'twas alone her filial love  II  The ruby lip the brilliant eye  The rosy cheek the graceful form  In turn for commendation vie  And justly the fir'd lover charm  But transient thesethe charm for life  Which reason ne'er shall disapprove  While truly shall ensure a wife  Faithful and kind is filial love  But here he comes I have brought this gentleman to share with me the pleasure of your conversation  Governor Lively  and  Blenheim  Blen  I longed to see you Siryou are allied to a worthy young manbut I am afraid that by visiting me you will involve yourself in a danger you are not aware ofin the ruin of a man proscribedIf a real criminal is punished he will soon be forgotten but if a man of blameless integrity is injured he will be persecuted with unrelenting hatred for the very mention of his name is a satire on the times and his existence is to the conscience of his enemies an unceasing remembrancer of guilt  Gov  I fear your words have too much truth in them and yet in the course of human contingencies it must happen that men of worth will occasionally be plunged in misfortune  Live  But ought that consideration to check the noble ardour of a soldier the poorest pensioner in this charity has his moments of exultation when he recollects he has fought bravely  Blen  True a love of glory is a noble passionbut do you think the pleasure that springs from conquest has a sincere and lasting charm in itAlas when a deluge of human blood bids the tears of natural affection flow in rivers round the land can the mind in that situation taste of joy  Live  NeverYet surely when this blood is spilt in their defence of whom nature intended us the guardians though our sensibility may be shocked our honour can never be stainedIn my mind defence and reprisals are the only justifiable measures in war while ambition is but another name for massacre  Blen  You have distinguished rightBut in your pursuits after fame you will have a worse enemy to guard against than ambitionEnvywhich when you have done your duty will make even accidents a ground of impeachment against youHave you done all that was possibleYou ought to have done betterThe charge is aggravated and the good you have done dwindles into nothingyour downfall is effected and some worthless wretch is sure to rise upon your ruins  Gov  This is indeed a melancholy truth  Blen  But 'tis a truth that springs from error more than injustice I teach it to this young man that he may rise superior to itthat he may consult his own heart and in that manly selfconference enquire  "Were I reduced to the condition of old Blenheim would my innocence make even affliction smile"  If you hesitate a moment to say yes to this question pass your life in obscurity for you have not the materials for a public character  AIR  Let your courage boy be true t'ye  Hard and painful is the soldier's duty  'Tis not alone to bravely dare  To fear a stranger  Each threat'ning danger  That whistles through the dusky air  Where thund'ring jar  Conflicting arms  All th' alarms  And dreadful havock of the war  Your duty done and home returning  With selfcommended ardour burning  If this right pride  Foes should deride  And from your merit turn aside  Though than the war the conflict's more severe  This is the trial you must learn to bear  Governor Lively  Gov  What injustice have I been guilty of to this man I would have discovered myself and remedied all but that I wish to come provided with the means I have thought what employ to procure him and mean to supply myself with the necessary instruments before I acquaint him with his good fortune  Live  Yonder comes his wife and daughter Sir  Gov  You tell me the old woman don't know who I am I suppose she'll abuse me liberally I'll humour itand as to the daughter I mean to make a trial of her  Live  Dear Sir  Gov  Nay I must insist upon your duty that you'll not interfere assisting the father is one thing but consenting to my son's marriage with the daughter is another her birth to be sure is as good as yours and fortune I do not regard but  Live  My life on't then you'll find that a prince might accept her alliance without a blushbut they are here  Governor Lively Esther Nancy  Est  Nay come along child I am not afraid to speak to him not I  Nan  My anxiety makes me break through every decorum pray tell mewhat of my father  Est  Ay let us

consider this gentleman's his relation  Est  What of that what of that the truth's the truth  Gov  Aye aye don't mince the matter speak what you think of him I assure you nobody would be so likely to blame him for doing wrong as I should  Est  Wrong Sir you shall judge yourself whether he has done wrong or no after all poor Blenheim's sufferings I am sure I shall never forget when his dear arm was shot through and through at Fontenoy I was waiting with some other gentlemen's wives upon a baggagewaggon and when he was brought home says he wife this is a smart wound but I am glad I received it for it saved my captain's life and don't you think after this that he must be the cruellest hard▪hearted old rogue  Gov  Oh certainly I never met with such an infamous piece of business in my life but now what plan would you have me pursue to make him do justice  Est  Why Sir if you'll be so good I'd have you go to him tell him what a villain he is and that if he ever expects to sleep quietly in his bed he'll come here directly and reward my poor husband for all he has undergone  Gov  You may depend upon mehe shall be righted and I don't doubt but there are many years of happiness yet in store for you  Est  Why most of my family lived to a good round age and for my part I'm brave and hearty  Gov  So you seem  Est  AIR  Why thanks be prais'd I'm pretty free  From sickness though I'm

for my father outweighs every other consideration  Gov  Your father has been illtreated matters have been falsely represented to me and he has severely suffered for it I mean to atone for my error but I hear it is expected that I shall countenance an extravagant passion which it seems my only son has thought proper to entertain for you  Nan  Sir my father's lessons and example has fortified me against the severest strokes of fortune his happiness  therefore accomplished I shall resign myself to whatever may be my fate without a sigh  Gov  I am glad to hear it this good sense seems to promise me that you'll see very fairly the propriety of breaking off this matter intirely  Live  For Heaven's sake Sir  Gov  Sir I shan't hear a word from you the girls has a hundred times your

ancient comrade as it were and understanding he is here we are come to crack a noggin with him  Laps  You'd be sorry to have him used ill should not you  Sol  I should like to see the man that dared to do it  Laps  You see those two men going out of the gate one of them is Governor Lively's son and the other some friend in disguiseI know there's mischief hatching for I heard them say they'd have the warrants filled up and then come and surprize them  Sol  Heyfire and fury follow me  Blenheim Malplaquet  and  Pensioners  Blen  'Tis true my honest comrade the grievances of people in our situation are not attended to so much as they ought but in the best institutions there will of necessity creep some abuses and we should be more reasonable if instead of magnifying the few we find we
