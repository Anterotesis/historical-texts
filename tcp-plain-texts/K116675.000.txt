 A LETTER To the Reverend Mr Dean  Swift c  Price Three Pence  A LETTER To the Reverend Mr Dean  Swift  Occasion'd by a SATIRE Said to be written by Him ENTITLED A DEDICATION  to a  GREAT MAN  concerning  DEDICATIONS  Discovering among other wonderful  SECRETS  what will be the present Posture of Affairs a thousand Years hence  By a Sparkish Pamphleteer of BUTTON's CoffeeHouse  LONDON  Printed for  James Roberts  in  WarwickLane    A LETTER To the Reverend Mr Dean  Swift c  Dear Doctor  _I Thank you in the Name of the Publick for your continuing to be useful notwithstanding you are a dignify'd Churchman The celebrated Lord  Falkland  talking of the Clergy in the House of Commons said  That as their Preaching was the Cause of their Preferment  so they made their Preferment the Cause of their not Preaching  and when I knew you were made a Dean I grew in mortal Fear that you would live  like your Brethren  and be good for nothing I confess a Deanary is a very good Reason for being idle and we infer that you are of the same Mind from your not having once set the three Kingdoms alaughing in five Years together whereas you used formerly when you had Wit in Pocketfulls and no Money to be tickling the Sides of Mankind once a Week at least What a Misfortune is it that the rich Man should always thus spoil the merry Fellow  I my self find it by Experience that Plenty is a damn'd Baulk to Mirth for I am always dull in Proportion to my Cash and witty in Proportion to the Feebleness of my Purse When I am Master of a few Half Crowns you would swear by my Looks and Heaviness I were an elder Brother or an Alderman such a magisterial Stupidity do I carry about me However for my Comfort  I am seldom attack'd by this Fit of Lethargy above  once a Year  On the other Hand when there is a Famine in my Fob my Head is in the best Plight in the World and I can write a Pamphlet in half an Hour  NEC ONUS NEC FRAENUM  a Colt or a Girl or a young Cat has not more Tricks and Liveliness  One Day I shall never forget it as I was raising a  Ghost  or describing a  Monster  or committing a  horrid and bloody Murder  Faith I can't tell which but one of them it was and the Press and the Hawkers both stood still for it I say upon that selfsame Day when I began with my usual Elegance to flourish and form my Periods I felt an unusual Slowness in my Invention and my Fancy though I pump'd it again and again and drew it by all its Teats would not yield one Drop of Milk and I could not for the Heart of me  make my Readers wonder  In this deplorable and neverenough to be lamented Dulness what does me I do but search first in my Noddle and then in my Breeches for the  strange  Ground of my present Woe and Unfruitfulness and to my great Astonishment in a private Corner of my Pocket lurk'd a crooked Sixpence  unfelt 'till then by human Finger  The Reason of its long Imprisonment was that in many Months I had never sent my Hand on any Message into my Pocket as well knowing  it had no Business there  As soon as I had laid my Hands on this  single Inhabitant  I resolv'd to make an Example of him and drown'd him immediately without Mercy in half a Pint of  Sherry  I then went readily and chearfully to work and having now neither Lett nor Molestation finish'd my Ghost with good Reputation to my self for it was reckon'd the very best and most terrible Apparition that haunted  Grubstreet  that Evening  I have not met with  such another Obstacle  in all the numerous Pamphlets which I have since produc'd While I have any Cash I neither think nor speak nor write but ramble and drink and pay and when I can pull out no more Money I pull out my Inkhorn and grow witty again  N B  For three Weeks past I have been a Wit without Interruption  I appeal to you dear Doctor whether the Case which I have been here describing was not once yours while your Circumstances were yet but lean and your Purse  GreyHoundgutted  I was therefore not a little surpriz'd to find you writing in Spight of your Gold and your Deanary I at first imagin'd there might be a general Famine in  Ireland  and that you were reduc'd to dine upon your Wit again but the Mirth and Festivity of your Book reliev'd me instantly from all Apprehension of this Kind and I have since consider'd you as only venting your Spleen against  a Piece of fulsome Roguery which continues still to go on in shameless Luxuriancy  Generally speaking you can as easily grope out Colour and Complextion with your Fingers and pore into the Nature of Harmony with your Eyes as discover the Characters of Great Persons in the Descriptions which are made of them in Dedications  Your  Essay  upon that Subject was certainly very useful and seasonable and I think you are own'd to have executed it with just Wit and Severity  Will the Quality never see that in these Panegyricks which Authors  sell  them they are first bely'd and then cheated The Language in most of those Cases is in Truth no other than this  My Lord give me Guineas and I will deceive you  Every Man who is deck'd in a Character which does not become him is so far dress'd in a Fool's Coat and Cap and expos'd to the Grin and Contempt of  all that can see it that is every Body but himself  Fame is a fleeting tender Thing and even where it is due it is lost or corrupted when bestow'd by improper or mercenary Hands  I knew a pretty young Girl in a Country Village who overfond of her own Praise became a Property to a poor Rogue in the Parish who was ignorant of all Things but  Fawning  This Fellow us'd to wait on Mrs  Betty  every Morning and she being a Shopkeeper his usual Salutation was  Lord love your Heart Mrs  Betty  you be main handsome will you give me a Pipe of Tobacco Am I  Isaac answers Mrs  Betty    let me see your Box  and then she fills it Thus  Isaac  extolls her out of a Quartern of  Cut and Dry  every Day she lives and tho' the young Woman is really handsome she and her Beauty are become a Byword and all the Country round she is call'd nothing but  Isaac  's  Best Virginia  There is but one Way of carrying Flattery to a greater Height than it is  already arriv'd to All Patrons have been Time out of Mind  perfectly  wise  perfectly  just  perfectly  valiant  perfectly  witty and  perfectly  beautiful all Patrons are so because all Authors have said so Now what remains to be done for the Improvement of Flattery even this Let the Poet buckle himself in Armour and mounting a mettl'd Steed sally forth into the Streets and Highways and challenge to single Combat any bold Varlet who dare assert that all the rest of the World are in the least Degree comparable for Virtue and Beauty and all that to one single Lord or Lady who is perhaps  if known  despis'd by all the rest of the World  I expect the Thanks of our Authors for this Hint of mine which yet I have borrow'd from themselves Considering what several of them have threaten'd long ago and do upon Occasion still threaten I have waited a good while to see them grasp the Lance and fall into the immediate Practice of this Piece of AuthorErrantry after having most humbly  invok'd his Grace or her Ladyship to be propitious  c  Says one Author    I know Sir your Modesty will be tortur'd by what I have here asserted but I am resolv'd to maintain my Point to the last Drop of my Pen  This Author I doubt carry'd his  Quixotism  too far he threatens to attack the  noble Squire  himself in Defence of the  noble Squire  himself  Another runs his Head against the Universe in Behalf of his Lord and Patron and cries  My Lord  In Spight of the Growlings of an envious World I will maintain it in the Face of Mankind that your Lordship is in all Respects the Only  most  and  most  and  most  and  most  and  most  He goes on in telling a great many  more  Lies which I do not care to repeat You see he makes a Curr  of the Universe and sets it agrowling at  my Lord  who is a much greater Man than Mr Universe himself And then he threatens to run Mankind through the Body if they do not own with him that  my Lord  is in  all Respects  the sweetest Creature in the three Parishes  A Third boldly pronounces    This Character which I have drawn of your Grace I will stand by and support while I have Life or Limb  This was a SheAuthor and whether by her  supporting  and her  Limbs  she did not mean bawdy I am not sure But I think the Meaning of the next is plain when she tells her  youthful Peer  that  Though he had committed sufficient Ravages among the Sex yet the Loveliness of his Looks and the  Firmness of his Make  made her conclude he was but beginning  In this Manner it is that you Poets and Parsons  create  Gods and  invent  Religions and then force us that  are but Laymen and Readers to worship the one and submit to the other on Pain of being damn'd and knock'd down  And it is most natural in the Business of Falshood and Forgery for those that have an Interest in their Maintainance to appear as much as is possible in great Earnest and in Order to it to punish and inveigh against all that dare see so well as to distinguish the monstrous Features and Deformities of your Deities and Doctrines  Suppose now I cannot with all my  Opticks  perceive that the Eyes of a  certain Earl  are so very brillant or that the Ceremonies of a  certain Church  are so very decent you must to be consistent with your selves and of Importance with the  Multitude  censure and destroy me for being an obstinate Enemy to the  Church  and the  Earl  for should the People by hearing my Reasons come to embrace my Opinions it might be my Turn next to direct and govern  your seeing  and  your believing  I should not dear Doctor have fallen into these Reflections  here  had it not come suddenly into my Mind that they are not unlike those I have heard you make formerly before you were  convinc'd  and  converted  by a  Deanary  Some have wonder'd how Doctor  Swift  whose Affection to the Church was never doubted tho' his Christianity was ever question'd should think the worse of some of the Clergy for their Trampling upon Loyalty and Oaths and for all his Reverence for the late Q and her Counsellors should make such honourable Mention of King  George  and his Ministers but as it is well known you never were a Slave to Constancy and Principle we can easily account for this your Behaviour and in Defence of it say That in this Instance you have put off Prejudice and resum'd your Understanding  Besides this others alledge that your Panegyrick is contradictory to your Banter upon  Dedications  But this you have your self answer'd  in your Preface to the fourth Edition in which you have the following Lines  'As to the  Characters  and  Inscriptions  at the End I still think them so just that I am not like to repent of them which may serve to shew me as much a Friend to wellgrounded Panegyrick as I ever shall be a Foe to all false Colouring There is no such Thing as Praise and Blame where they are not apply'd and as I take upon me to expose the one I think I need ask no Pardon for attempting to practice the other'  It remains now for me to entertain you with some Remarks on the present State of this Town which no Man knew some Years ago better than your self  And to begin with that which with Gentlemen of your Faculty  claims Precedence  of the King himself the GOOD CHURCH of  ENGLAND  I am sorry to tell you she is in the same puny  complaining  Condition which you Mr Dean left her in and languishes  so immoderately that if she do not very shortly kick up her  reverend  Heel and depart this  establish'd  Life your Brethren the  Parsons  are  false Prophets  for they have not only  with one Mouth  predicted her Downfal these thirty Years but are  at this very Juncture  preaching the  paralytick old Lady's FuneralOration  every Sunday that passes So that if she be not already stonedead there's no believing the Cassock  The  Spreading of Reports  that the King is  in Danger  or dead is generally if not always taken as a  Mark of Disaffection  and as such punishable If the forging of Tales concerning the  Danger of the Church  may be judg'd by the like Rule I doubt most of her  pious Sons  will be found  errant Bastards  The present  Tottering State  of that  Venerable Matron  proceeds from the  dreadful Power  which a  new Act  of Parliament gives to  old Women  to teach Children to read From hence it is orthodoxly concluded that the said  old Women  will like  Giants  and  Generals head an  Army of Infants  arm'd with Psalters and Hornbooks against the  Hierarchy  Add to all this another  terrible Circumstance  a Man may  now  venture to hear  Tom Bradbury  without being ruin'd by the  Forfeiture  of his  Place  and the  neglected Priesthood  can have  no other  Vengeance upon such a  Delinquent  but barely CURSING him  A Quaker in  Kent  when he was press'd by a zealous Tory to conform to the  establish'd Church  made this  roguish reasonable  Answer  Friend thee may'st spare thy Breath and Perswasion I will never be of that CHURCH which is always in Danger  And some People as arch and  atheistical  as our Quaker are ready to tell you that neither their Principles nor  their Noses  will allow them to communicate with a  Church  which if our  latest Advices  from the  Pulpit be true  is already  stinking  in her  Sepulchre  The Right Reverend and right learned Lord Bishop of  London  differs from many of his Clergy upon  this Head and seems of Opinion that the  establish'd Church  has still  some  Existence  This  orthodox primitive  Bishop has lately writ a  perspicuous  and  perswasive  Epistle to the Priests of his Diocese and in it warns them with a paternal Tenderness against the  new  Doxologies of  ancient Hereticks  Besides he tells them that if they neglect their  Duty to God and the King  they are liable to pay five Pounds and his Lordship no doubt knew what Arguments were like to be of most Force with  them  We have had lately two new Plays one is Sir  Walter Raleigh  a Tragedy It is acted with good Applause at the  New House  its own native Worth hiding in a good Degree the Insufficiency of some of the Actors You will find in it many beautiful Thoughts and Lines  The other is a new Play of an  ancient Poet  it is call'd  The Masquerade  and acted in  DruryLane  It  fill'd the House a few Nights with People and Hissing but that Theatre never fails having a large Audience tho' they act  Charles Johnson  or  Tom Thumb  This Winter has produc'd but few Pamphlets which the Town has vouchsafed to smile on You know to be sure what Acceptance  your  Essay upon Dedications has met with and there is an Apology for Parson  Alberoni  which has already run to the  ninth Edition  This little Book is such a Thorn in the Sides of the Clergy that it is every where taken for granted you are the Author of it So that you are this Year as you used to be at the Head of all the Pamphleteers in  Great Britain  I am just now told that the Right Honourable the  Players  and  Privy Counsellors  in the  Old House  have found out that they are a  Ministry within themselves  and have notify'd the same  in Form  to my  Lord Chamberlain  by the Mouth of their  Plenipo  and  Copyer in Chief  the well bred Mr  Colley Cibber  But I hear  his Grace  frowns upon these  Actors of State  and is almost provok'd to shut up  their Palace  because they were saucy to him  and pleaded their Patent for it  Vice and Dulness  Dear Doctor  never reign'd more irresistibly than they do at the very Time of the  signing and sealing hereof  Our Wits leave us in Pairs  Grath  and  Row  are just gone and others of  their Spirit and Genius  are in a fair Way to follow them but Debauchery  Beaus  and Insolence gather Ground and Numbers For my Part I cannot help foreseeing and dreading the Day when it will be as unfashionable to be Witty as 'tis now to be Goodnatur'd or Sober  I am Dear Doctor your Friend and Servant P A
