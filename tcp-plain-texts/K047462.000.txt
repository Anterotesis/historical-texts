sad with all his rising Train  Vapours  and  Clouds  and  Storms  Be these my Theme  These that exalt the Soul to solemn Thought  And heavenly musing Welcome kindred Glooms  Wish'd wint'ry Horrors hailWith frequent Foot  Pleas'd have I in my cheerful Morn of Life  When nurs'd by careless  Solitude  I liv'd  And sung of Nature with unceasing Joy  Pleas'd have I wander'd thro' your rough Domains  Trod the pure virgin Snows my self as pure  Heard the Winds roar and the big Torrent burst  Or seen the deep fermenting Tempest brew'd  In the red evening SkyThus pass'd the Time  Till thro' the opening Chambers of the South  Look'd out the joyous  Spring  look'd out and smil'd  THEE too Inspirer of the toiling Swain  Fair AUTUMN yellow rob'd I'll sing of thee  Of thy last temper'd Days and sunny Calms  When all the golden  Hours  are on the Wing  Attending thy Retreat and round thy Wain  Slowrolling onward to the Southern Sky  BEHOLD the wellpois'd  Hornet  hovering hangs  With quivering Pinions in the genial Blaze  Flys off in airy Circles then returns  And hums and dances to the beating Ray  Nor shall the Man that musing walks alone  And heedless strays within his radiant Lists  Go unchastis'd awaySometimes a Fleece  Of Clouds widescattering with a lucid Veil  Soft shadow o'er th' unruffled Face of Heaven  And thro' their dewy Sluices shed the Sun  With temper'd Influence down Then is the Time  For those whom  Wisdom  and whom  Nature  charm  To steal themselves from the degenerate Croud  And soar above this  little  Scene of Things  To tread lowthoughted  Vice  beneath their Feet  To lay their Passions in a gentle Calm  And woo lone  Quiet  in her silent  Walks  NOW solitary and in pensive Guise  Oft let me wander o'er the russet Mead  Or thro' the pining Grove where scarce is heard  One dying Strain to chear the  Woodman  's Toil  Sad  Philomel  perchance pours forth her Plaint  Far thro' the withering Copse Mean while the Leaves  That late the Forest clad with lively Green  Nipt by the drizzly Night and Sallowhu'd  Fall wavering thro' the Air or shower amain  Urg'd by the Breeze that sobs amid the Boughs  Then list'ning  Hares  forsake the rusling Woods  And starting at the frequent Noise escape  To the rough Stubble and the rushy Fen  Then  Woodcocks  o'er the fluctuating Main  That glimmers to the Glimpses of the Moon  Stretch their long Voyage to the woodland Glade  Where wheeling with uncertain Flight they mock  The nimble  Fowler  's AimNow  Nature  droops  Languish the living Herbs with pale Decay  And all the  various Family  of Flowers  Their sunny Robes resign The falling Fruits  Thro' the still Night forsake the ParentBough  That in the first grey Glances of the Dawn  Looks wild and wonders at the wintry Waste  THE  Year  yet pleasing but declining fast  Soft o'er the secret Soul in gentle Gales  A Philosophic Melancholly breathes  And bears the swelling Thought aloft to Heaven  Then forming  Fancy  rouses to conceive  What never mingled with the Vulgar's Dream  Then wake the tender  Pang  the pitying  Tear    The  Sigh  for suffering Worth the  Wish  prefer'd  For Humankind the  Joy  to see them bless'd  And all the  Social Offspring  of the Heart  OH bear me then to high embowering Shades  To twilight Groves and visionary Vales  To weeping Grottos and to hoary Caves  Where AngelForms are seen and Voices heard  Sigh'd in low Whispers that abstract the Soul  From outward Sense far into Worlds remote  NOW when the Western Sun withdraws the Day  And humid  Evening  gliding o'er the Sky  In her chill Progress checks the straggling Beams  And robs them of their gather'd vapoury Prey  Where Marshes stagnate and where Rivers wind  Cluster the rolling  Fogs  and swim along  The duskymantled Lawn then slow descend  Once more to mingle with their  Watry Friends  The vivid Stars shine out in radiant Files  And boundless  Ether  glows till the fair Moon  Shows her broad Visage in the crimson'd East  Now stooping seems to kiss the passing Cloud  Now o'er the pure  Cerulean  rides sublime  Wide the pale Deluge floats with silver Waves  O'er the sky'd Mountain to the lowlaid Vale  From the white Rocks with dim Reflexion gleams  And faintly glitters thro' the waving Shades  ALL Night abundant Dews unnoted fall  And at Return of Morning silver o'er  The Face of MotherEarth from every Branch  Depending tremble the translucent Gems  And quivering seem to fall away yet cling  And sparkle in the Sun whose rising Eye  With Fogs bedim'd portends a beauteous Day  NOW giddy Youth whom headlong Passions fire  Rouse the wild Game and stain the guiltless Grove  With Violence and Death yet call it Sport  To scatter Ruin thro' the Realms of  Love    And  Peace  that thinks no Ill But These the  Muse    Whose Charity unlimited extends  As wide as  Nature  works disdains to sing  Returning to her nobler Theme in view  FOR see where  Winter  comes himself confest  Striding the gloomy Blast First Rains obscure  Drive thro' the mingling Skies with Tempest foul  Beat on the Mountain's Brow and shake the Woods  That sounding wave below The dreary Plain  Lies overwhelm'd and lost The bellying Clouds  Combine and deepening into Night shut up  The Day's fair Face The Wanderers of Heaven  Each to his Home retire save those that love  To take their Pastime in the troubled Air  And skimming flutter round the dimply Flood  The Cattle from th' untasted Fields return  And ask with Meaning low their wonted Stalls  Or ruminate in the contiguous Shade  Thither the houshold feathery People croud  The crested Cock with all his female Train  Pensive and wet Mean while the CottageSwain  Hangs o'er th' enlivening Blaze and taleful there  Recounts his simple Frolic Much he talks  And much he laughs nor recks the Storm that blows  Without and rattles on his humble Roof  AT last the muddy Deluge pours along  Resistless roaring dreadful down it comes  From the chapt Mountain and the mossy Wild  Tumbling thro' Rocks abrupt and sounding far  Then o'er the sanded Valley floating spreads  Calm sluggish silent till again constrain'd  Betwixt two meeting Hills it bursts a Way  Where Rocks and Woods o'erhang the turbid Stream  There gathering triple Force rapid and deep  It boils and wheels and foams and thunders thro'  NATURE great Parent whose directing Hand  Rolls round the Seasons of the changeful Year  How mighty how majestick are thy Works  With what a pleasing Dread they swell the Soul  That sees astonish'd and astonish'd sings  You too ye  Winds  that now begin to blow  With boisterous Sweep I raise my Voice to you  Where are your Stores ye viewless  Beings  say  Where your aerial Magazines reserv'd  Against the Day of Tempest perilous  In what untravel'd Country of the Air  Hush'd in still Silence sleep you when 'tis calm  LATE in the louring Sky red fiery Streaks  Begin to flush about the reeling Clouds  Stagger with dizzy Aim as doubting yet  Which Master to obey while rising slow  Sad in the Leadencolour'd East the Moon  Wears a black Circle round her fully'd Orb  Then issues forth the Storm with loud Control  And the thin Fabrick of the pillar'd Air  O'erturns at once Prone on th' uncertain Main  Descends th' Etherial Force and plows its Waves  With dreadful Rist from the midDeep appears  Surge after Surge the rising wat'ry War  Whitening the angry Billows rowl immense  And roar their Terrors thro' the shuddering Soul  Of feeble Man amidst their Fury caught  And dash'd upon his Fate Then o'er the Cliff  Where dwells the  SeaMew  unconfin'd they fly  And hurrying swallow up the steril Shore  THE Mountain growls and all its sturdy  Sons  Stoop to the Bottom of the Rocks they shade  Lone on its MidnightSide and all aghast  The dark wayfaring  Stranger  breathless toils  And climbs against the Blast  Low waves the rooted Forest vex'd and sheds  What of its leafy Honours yet remains  Thus struggling thro' the dissipated Grove  The whirling Tempest raves along the Plain  And on the Cottage thacht or lordly Dome  Keenfastening shakes 'em to the solid Base  Sleep  frighted flies the hollow Chimney howls  The Windows rattle and the Hinges creak  THEN too they say thro' all the burthen'd Air  Long Groans are heard shrill Sounds and distant Sighs  That murmur'd by the  Demon  of the Night  Warn the devoted  Wretch  of Woe and Death  Wild Uproar lords it wide the Clouds commixt  With Stars swiftgliding sweep along the Sky  All Nature reelsBut hark the  Almighty  speaks  Instant the chidden Storm begins to pant  And dies at once into a noiseless Calm  AS yet 'tis Midnight's Reign the weary Clouds  Slowmeeting mingle into solid Gloom  Now while the drousy World lies lost in Sleep  Let me associate with the lowbrow'd  Night    And  Contemplation  her sedate Compeer  Let me shake off th' intrusive Cares of Day  And lay the medling Senses all aside  AND now ye lying  Vanities  of Life  You evertempting evercheating Train  Where are you now and what is your Amount  Vexation Disappointment and Remorse  Sad sickening Thought and yet deluded Man  A Scene of wild disjointed Visions past  And broken Slumbers rises still resolv'd  With newflush'd Hopes to run your giddy Round  FATHER of Light and Life Thou  Good Supreme  O teach me what is Good teach me thy self  Save me from Folly Vanity and Vice  From every low Pursuit and feed my Soul  With Knowledge conscious Peace and Vertue pure  Sacred substantial neverfading Bliss  LO from the livid East or piercing North  Thick Clouds ascend in whose capacious Womb  A vapoury Deluge lies to Snow congeal'd  Heavy they roll their fleecy World along  And the Sky saddens with th' impending Storm  Thro' the hush'd Air the whitening Shower descends  At first thinwavering till at last the Flakes  Fall broad and wide and fast dimming the Day  With a continual Flow See sudden hoar'd  The Woods beneath the stainless Burden bow  Blackning along the mazy Stream it melts  Earth's universal Face deephid and chill  Is all one dazzling Waste The LabourerOx  Stands cover'd o'er with Snow and then demands  The Fruit of all his Toil The Fowls of Heaven  Tam'd by the cruel Season croud around  The winnowing Store and claim the little Boon  That  Providence  allows The foodless Wilds  Pour forth their brown  Inhabitants  the Hare  Tho' timorous of Heart and hard beset  By Death in various Forms dark Snares and Dogs  And more unpitying Men the Garden seeks  Urg'd on by  fearless  Want The bleating Kind  Eye the bleak Heavens and next the glistening Earth  With Looks of dumb Despair then sad dispers'd  Dig for the wither'd Herb thro' Heaps of Snow  NOW  Shepherds  to your helpless Charge be kind  Baffle the raging Year and fill their Penns  With Food at will lodge them below the Blast  And watch them strict for from the bellowing East  In this dire Season oft the Whirlwind's Wing  Sweeps up the Burthen of whole wintry Plains  In one fierce Blast and o'er th' unhappy Flocks  Lodg'd in the Hollow of two neighbouring Hills  The billowy Tempest whelms till upwards urg'd  The Valley to a shining Mountain swells  That curls its Wreaths amid the freezing Sky  NOW all amid the Rigours of the Year  In the wild Depth of Winter while without  The ceaseless Winds blow keen be my Retreat  A rural shelter'd solitary Scene  Where ruddy Fire and beaming Tapers join  To chase the chearless Gloom there let me sit  And hold high Converse with the mighty Dead  Sages  of ancient Time as Gods rever'd  As Gods beneficent who blest Mankind  With Arts and Arms and humaniz'd a World  Rous'd at th' inspring ThoughtI throw aside  The longliv'd Volume and deepmusing hail  The sacred  Shades  that slowlyrising pass  Before my wondering EyesFirst  Socrates    Truth's early Champion Martyr for his God  Solon  the next who built his Commonweal  On Equity's firm Base  Lycurgus  then  Severely good and him of rugged  Rome    Numa  who soften'd  her  rapacious  Sons  Cimon  sweetsoul'd and  Aristides  just  Unconquer'd  Cato  virtuous in Extreme  With that attemper'd  Timoleon  Heroe mild and firm  Who wept the Brother

the Orient darkly red breathes forth  An Icy Gale that in its mid Career  Arrests the bickering Stream The nightly Sky  And all her glowing Constellations pour  Their rigid Influence down It freezes on  Till Morn laterising o'er the drooping World  Lifts her pale Eye unjoyous then appears  The various Labour of the silent Night  The pendant Isicle the FrostWork fair  Where thousand Figures rise
