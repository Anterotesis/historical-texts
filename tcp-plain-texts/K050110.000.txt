 THE CHARACTERS AND CONDUCT OF Sir  John Edgar  c  THE CHARACTERS AND CONDUCT OF Sir  John Edgar  AND HIS Three  DeputyGovernours  During the Administration of the late SEPARATE MINISTRY In a Third and Fourth Letter to the KNIGHT WITH A Picture of Sir JOHN Drawn by a Pen exactly after the Life  LONDON  Printed and Sold by J ROBERTS in  WarwickLane  Price  Six Pence  To His GRACE the DUKE OF NEWCASTLE  My LORD  _ADresses of this nature are but too often Petitions for Favours to come But the Intention of this is to return thanks to your Grace for the Favour you did me the Honour to confer upon me in  November  last Your Grace perhaps may inclin'd to believe that my Acknowledgment comes somewhat of the  latest I therefore being concern'd to vindicate the Reputation of my Gratitude take the Liberty to assure your Grace that I knew nothing certainly of the Favour which by your Order was conferr'd upon me in  November  last till within this Fortnight And as I had heard nothing certain of it till so long after your Grace had commanded it for that very Reason I had believ'd nothing of it when I did hear of it if a Gentleman of undoubted Honour had not assur'd me that he was present when you were pleas'd to give Directions about it As I knew nothing of it till within this Fortnight so all I know of it now is the assurance which that Gentleman has given me that your Grace has ordered it For tho depending upon that Gentleman's Honour and his Integrity I have endeavour'd to have Evidence of Sense in the Case as much as I could endeavour it with any manner of Decency and without subjecting my self  to be treated in my Messengers with repeated and intolerable Insolence by that Servant who receiv'd your Grace's Command to convey your Favour to me I have found to my infinite Surprize that at the very time that I have been labouring to unmask and expose an Hypocritical Wretch who has had the Impudence and the Ingratitude publickly to affront your Grace as far as Animals of his Species can affront you at that very time one of your own Domestick Servants your errant Creature who subsists entirely by your Bounty has been diligent and industrious in giving me all the Disappointment and all the Disturbance that it has been in his Power to give me and consequently all the Diversion that he could possibly give me in favour of your Grace's declar'd and mortal Enemy  But as your Grace's conferring this Favour consisted in your ordering it to  be done and not in my receiving it I am obliged to return you my humble Thanks for it as much as if I were in actual Possession of it  I am Very sorry that upon Addressing my self twice to your Grace after this manner I have been oblig'd each time to make a Complaint to you But I cannot absolutely despair of your Pardon for it when I consider that your Grace's Honour has been more concern'd in each Complaint than any Inrerest of mine Since I made the first Complaint to you I have had the Satisfaction to see that your Grace has retriev'd the Jurisdiction over our  Theatres  which is annex'd to your Office as  Lord Chamberlain  of his Majesty's  Houshold  and have had the Pleasure to hear that you have mortify'd four Insolent Wretches who had dar'd to usurp it from you  As for the Complaint which I lay before you at present I must leave it to be determin'd by your Grace's Wisdom and Justice whether the Insolence of the late  Separate Ministry  whether the Insolence of Sir  John Edgar  himself was ever so flagrant or so insupportable as that of your Domestick and Menial Servant who has presum'd to abuse your Grace's Service in the most Injurious Manner to treat a Person insolently whom you had treated favourably to intercept and retain your Favour and betray the Trust repos'd in him and to controul you in your very Domain where because you are most independent you ought to be most uncontroulable  My Lord if your Grace should be in the least surpriz'd at the uncommon Method of conveying this Complaint to you I am inclin'd to believe that you will have the Goodness to  consider that the subject Matter of it is a great deal more strange and more extraordinary than the manner of conveying it to you For I appeal to all those Persons of Condition who have been us'd to receive Addresses of this nature if they ever knew or ever heard of any thing like it in any of their Servants before  Besides I had a great deal of Reason to believe that I had no other way of approaching your Grace For he who has had the Assurance for four Months together to intercept and retain your Grace's Favour would certainly have ventur'd to intercept any Letter that should have come from me or to hinder my having any personal Access to you But I believe he dare hardly do that by the little Book to which this is prefix'd and which I have here the Honour to send you If his Presumption should extend so far my Comfort is that your  Grace will hear of the Contents of this Epistle from a Hundred of your Humble Servants  I am My Lord Your Grace's most obedient and most humble Servant  LETTER III TO Sir John Edgar  My Dear KNIGHT  _SINCE I perceive that there is like to be a long Commerce of Paper Civilities between us two I think we could not do better for the making the Correspondence perfectly easie to us both than to continue as we have begun to throw off all manner of Ceremony and to treat each other with that Familiarity which is so becoming our long and old Acquaintance This is then one branch of the Cartel establish'd between us that thou should'st seem not to remember that the King has made me a Gentleman and that I should not fail to forget that he ever made thee a Knight So that for the future I shall be downright  What d'ye call  with thee and thou my dear Knight shalt be plain  Jack Edgar  with me In which branch of the Cartel thou hast by much the Advantage of me For my diminutive Honour was establishd by no less than two Patents the one granted by the late Queen and the other by His  present Majesty whereas thine was conferr'd only by a transitory Blow given upon Shoulderblade which when some jeering malicious Persons heard of they said they rejoyc'd that Honour was got so near as within a Foot of thy  Pericranium  But now to enter upon business how agreeably was I surpriz'd with that notable Distinction in the beginning of thy eleventh Paper which makes thy Apology for thy going by an  Alias  And that is that when a Man goes by an  alias  in order to commit a Robbery or a Murther or lye with his Neighbour's Wife why that is not so well But when an old Soldier of the Queen takes up a  nomdeguerre  only for the promotion of Virtue why that is a laudable Action Now here cannot I forbear for my Life using the same expression to you which was formerly us'd to another old  Thraso  in the Eunuch of  Terence  Soldier  Dî vostram Fidem Quanti est sapere Nunquam accedo Quin abs te abeam Doctior  For my part I have all along been weak enough to believe that to go by an  alias  is a manifest Cheat and that every Impostor means Interest and not Virtue But this notable Distinction has almost convinced me that if the writer of a Libel puts but a sham Name to it he has a Dispensation by that  alias  to injure slander and threaten all that is Powerful and Noble in  Great Britain  But that if any one pretends to write ev'n a just Satire upon the vilest Poetaster or Politicaster between  Dover  and the  Orcades  without putting any Name at all to it why the Action is abominable it cries aloud for the extremest Vengeance and deserves Death without  Mercy But honest  Jack Edgar  I have one scruple in my Head  Boileau  was certainly a Man of true Judgment of nice Honour and a very just and admirable Satirist His Censures were always just and so were his Praises if you except a very few addrest to his Great Monarch Merit and Virtue were always Sacred to him and Vice and Folly the objects of his Scorn and Hatred Now when he publish'd a Book of Satires which were chiefly levell'd at the  Edgars  and  Ironsides  who flourish'd then at  Paris  that is at a number of Coxcombs who dar'd to appear upon  Parnassus  without any lawful Summons thither or in plain  English  without either Genius or Judgment you know very well  Jack Edgar  that he put no name to his Book  The violence and virulence of the contending Parties in  England  have I am afraid been one great cause why we have had no just Satire in  England  since the Author of  Hudibras  publish'd his which seems to me to be a very just one on Hypocrisy But you are not to be told that the Author of it put no Name to it We have since had Libels which have pass'd for Satires as  Absalom  and  Achitophel  the  Medal Mac Fleckno  and the  Dispensary  They are indeed if you please beautiful Libels but they are every where full of Flattery or Slander and a just Satire admits of neither In the two first how many were abus'd only for being true to the Religion and Liberties of their Country And on the other side some were extoll'd only for being false to both The attempt to lessen  Shadwell  in  Mackflecno  is every whit as unworthy of Satire For  Shadwell  pretended to no Species of Poetry but the Comick in which he was certainly very much superiour to  Dryden  as the latter acknowledges  by a very fair implication in his  Preface  to the  State of Innocence  which was writ before the Quarrel between them began The business of Sir  Samuel Garth  in his  Dispensary  was to expose much better Physicians than himself for no other reason but because they were not of his Opinion in the affair of the  Dispensary  Now tho' these were Libels and very injurious yet the Authors justly thought it more creditable to suffer them to be publish'd without any Name rather than to make use of false ones  I am heartily glad my dear Friend that I have pleas'd thee so by saying that thou hast done more harm to the Stage than any hundred Men in all  England  For say'st thou the World is so Wicked that tis hardly a Disparagement to be great ev'n in Ill But I am afraid honest  Jack  thou mistakest me For when I accus'd thee of doing this harm to the Stage I did not affirm that thou didst it altogether through a sinister Design or a wicked Motive of Interest but that there was always a mixture with the other two of want of Knowledge and Judgment And tho' it may be reputable in this wicked World to be great in Ill I believe it will hardly ever be creditable to be great in Folly I do not say but that there may be a very wise Man who may know nothing of Theatrical matters But then this Person who does not know them must not pretend to know them nor to dictate to the World in an affair which he does not at all understand For there is a wise and a knowing Ignorance an Ignorance that reflects upon its self and restrains him who has it from exposing or hurting himself or others by undertaking things which he does not in the least understand  And now my dear Friend thou art for mounting that War Horse afresh from which I shew'd thee descending Methinks I see thee upon him in all thy Accoutrements thy cock'd Hat thy broad Sword thy Shoulder Belt and thy Jack Boots and a hugeous merry Figure thou makest upon him But when thou talkest of planting thy self behind King  William  the Third against  Lewis  the Fourteenth does not thy Memory fail thee a little If thou meanest planting thy self behind the Coach of King  William  I have nothing to say against that But I never heard a great deal of thy attendance on him when he got on Horseback He seldom  held  the Honour of thy Company to express my self in the quaint Dialect of thy elder Brother of  Brentford  either on the  Boyne  or the  Shannon  or the  Maese  or the  Sambre  Thou hadst that aversion for the effusion of Christian Blood that rather than go into the Field with thy broad Sword and thy dead doing Hand to make piteous Slaughter of the Enemy thou mad'st it thy choice to stay here at Home and make wicked Jokes with thy  Irish  Goose Quill upon the Funerals of thy Friends  But here my dear Friend thou art in a terrible fuss about going to Law Thou pretend'st to be even Mad that thou art hinder'd from going to Law the Law is not open to thee thou hast not the freedom of the Law But  Quaere peregrinum vicinia rauca reclamat  For do not we all know that thou art up to the Ears in Law that thou hast been up to the Ears in Law these twenty Years and wilt be up to the Ears in Law if thou shouldst live these hundred Years Can we forbear laughing then to hear thee cry out that thou shouldst be the happiest Man in the World  if thou couldst but go to Law Ah my dear Friend I could name some certain Persons who if they were no more restrain'd from going to Law than thou art would be happy indeed But what is it that hinders thee from going to Law The Gate of Madam Justice like that of Hell is open at all Hours Free ingress is denyed to none that have but Money to pay their Entrance Egress I must confess is not altogether To easie What is it then that thou pretendest should restrain thee from going to Law Hast thou not Money to pay thy Lawyers Or art thou suing some unaccountable Debtors who having Money to spare for their Liberalities and their Profusions have that irregular greatness of Soul that they scorn to pay a just Debt till it comes to Execution and who instead of discharging or so much as owning the Obligation they have to thee pretend to keep thee at Arms length and bid thee open Defiance Should that be the Case I believe I can give thee wholsome Advice Know then that there is a certain notable Serjeant at Law with a hard Name who if thou repairest to him will instruct thee in an admirable Method of dealing with such Persons But at the same time I cannot help acquainting my dear Friend that he ought to be asham'd to have the word Law in his Mouth as long as he pretends to undo an Act of the Legislature by an Act of the Executive Power  We are come now from Law by a Whirl of Imagination to Conjurers and Hoop Petticoats But why will you go abroad for Intelligence which you may have at home or go for Counsel to the Deputy when you may be advis'd by the Principal For does not every Mortal who reads your Papers say the Devil in Hell is in  you Besides how come you so earnest to get a Patent for the Hoop which you were so eager to demolish in your wonderful Speculations  But my dear Friend thou hast been pleas'd in this thy eleventh Paper to return the Title of Pedant by which I saluted thee in one of my former according to thy usual Method of giving what is thy own to those who do not in the least deserve it Tho' I plainly perceive that thou art not quite so proud of this Title as thou art of that of  Knight  yet to shew thee that I saluted thee with proper Greeting I shall endeavour to prove that however disagreeable the Sound of Pedant may be to thee thou art certainly the Thing and in order to this will endeavour to shew thee what a Pedant and Pedantry are of which in thy Lucubrations and Speculations thou hast so often treated  In proper terms such as Men smatter  When they throw out and miss the matter  Hud  The Pedant then is literally and originally speaking he who has the Instruction of Boys and the Pedant in the figurative Appellation which is now come to be the common one is he who in his Conversations with Men or in his Writings to Men shews the qualities of an Instructor of Boys Now Boys not being come to the use of their Judgment nor the force of their Imagination are chiefly instructed by Memory Their Instructors therefore never argue with them but only dictate to them and make use of Authority instead of Reason with them And to exert their Authority the more and to  cause it to make the stronger Impression they dictate with a haughty and imperious Air which sometimes is augmented to such a Degree by Weakness IllBreeding Pride and Choler that it becomes insupportable even to their dearest Friends and Relations And if their Pupils are backward in receiving their Instructions or give them the slightest Provocation they treat them with all those Flowers of Rhetorick with which those Persons are always inspir'd who frequent the sonorous Nymphs of the Floud that haunt the Banks of the vocal  Thames  between the  Bridge  and the  Tower  Thus have I shewn that the Pedant in the Acceptation in which the Word is commonly us'd has the same qualities with an Instructor of Boys the chief of which qualities are a dogmatizing Spirit a presumptuous Arrogance and a soaring Insolence  Now the Man of Sense and the Gentleman being diametrically opposite to the Pedant must be one who in his Conversations and in his Writings has the qualities of one who converses with or writes to Men Now he who knows the World and converses with or writes to Men always Argues and never Dictates as well knowing that reasonable Creatures are to be convinced by Reason and not by Authority And as Reason and Truth are calm and modest things he never assumes the Dictatorian Air is never Haughty never Insolent  But if at any time he barely asserts he does it with Modesty if not with Diffidence as very well knowing that tho' a Man by an insolent decisive Air may pass upon those who are govern'd  by Fancy or Opinion it never fails to render him suspected to those who are resolv'd never to submit to any Opinion till they be convinced by Reason which latter sort only may be truly said to be Men He therefore treats his Companion or Reader with respect and would look upon it as a scandalous Indignity the breaking out into those Tropes and Figures which are so much in use with those who converse with or who write to Boys of what Age or Rank or Condition whatsoever those Boys are whether they are in Infancy or Youth or Virility or Gravity or Decrepitude whether they are Ignorant or Learned Boys of the Lees of the People or of Equestrian Dignity  And now by applying all this to my very worthy Friend I make no doubt but to make it appear not only that thou hast the Spirit of Pedantry in thee equal to any of thy Contemporaries or Predecessours but that thou hast by Nature and Genius what they have acquir'd by Industry and hard Labour for thou art certainly an illiterate Pedant and art the very Cock Pedant of all the Nest of Pedants For besides that in all thy Writings whether Papers or Pamphlets whether  Lucubrations Speculations Guardian Lover  or  Englishman  I hardly ever knew thee argue once thou hast carried Authority to a more ridiculous Height than ever Pedant before thee did For if the rest of thy Brethren have had the Extravagance and the Presumption to bear down Human Reason by downright Human Authority they have still had so much shadow of Modesty left as to attempt it by the Authority of others and not by their own If shoals of modern Pedants have arriv'd to that height of Extravagance as to pretend to decide Disputes  where Reason alone ought to prevail by an  Ipse dixit  yet none before thy self has had the Arrogance and the Impudence to do it by an  Ipse dixi  But thou hast often set up thy own Authority not only against Human Reason but against all other Human Authority Thou hast thought thy own dogmatick Assertion enough to establish any Opinion which thy private Interest requir'd and like an Absolute Monarch upon the Throne of Pedantry hast believ'd it sufficient to say  Car tel est notre plaisir  I must confess that several of the  Tatlers  have Wit and Humour in them a fine Raillery and an agreeable Pleasantry and some of the  Spectators  likewise have some of these good Qualities but I have powerful reasons to believe that for the most part the good Qualities in those Writings are deriv'd from thy Correspondents and that only the Pedantry of them is thine For when thou endeavourdst to entertain the World with a Paper call'd the  Guardian  after that Mr  Addison  had abandon'd thee and Mr  Manwaring  was entirely employ'd against the  Examiner  I found nothing in that Paper of the Qualities of the other but only thy eternal Dogmatizing and the haughty and pedantick Air of a Schoolmaster Nay in this Paper thou wert dwindled into a Pedant even according to the Litteral Acceptation of the Words and appear'dst every Morning with thy formal Instructors amidst thy Boys and thy Girls  I come next to the Vindication of thy Beauty But here my dear  Jacky  Boy let us be serious a little Thou knowest I am thy Friend and wish thee well I would not have thee make thy self a Jest and a Byword and a Butt to all  the World Thy Beauty Man Why thou mayst as well brag in thy old Age of thy Dancing a Jig I never heard thee mention'd by any Woman for these three Years last past but thou either wentst by the Appellation of the Black Knight with her or she said she could resemble thee to nothing so nearly as to the Knave of  Clubs  I receiv'd the following Letter from a Friend immediately upon the publication of the th and th  Theatre  Dear Sir  YOURS of Yesterday I receiv'd this Morning I have seen the noble Knight's Production which you mention and could not but laugh to read of the Knight's Tears I suppose they were produc'd by the Author of the two Letters questioning his Beauty which he takes some pains in a most ridiculous manner to vindicate He seems patient enough under the Confutation of his Reason and Understanding to which he replyes not one Word But the  Beau Garcon  of Sixty cannot bear an attack on his Beauty and is forc'd to write Letters to himself like other old Beaux from suppos'd Ladies to vindicate what he never possess'd The Knight has discover'd a great deal of Malice and utter'd a great deal of Slander in his last Paper but this Verse of  Dryden  's will fit his Performance  In his Felonious Heart tho' Venom lyes  It does but touch his  Irish  Pen and dyes  I am  c  This is only under one Man's Hand but this you may depend upon it is the Voice of the People And whereas thou sayst that thou art so far from having a dusky Countenance that all Orders of Men smile on thee thou putst me in mind of part of a Dialogue between Monsieur  Nathaniel Paris  and his Cousin  Hippolita  in the  Gentleman Dancing Master  of the late Mr  Wycherly  'Tis in the beginning of the Third Act  Mons  Am I so happy den Cousin in the  bon  quality of making People laugh  Hipp  Mighty Happy Cousin  Mons  Degrace  Hipp  Indeed  Mons  Nay  Sans vanitie  I observe that wheresoever I come I make every body Merry  Sans vanitie Da  Hipp  I do believe you do  Mons  Nay as I march in de Street I can make de dull Apprentie Laugh and Sneer  Hipp  This Fool is as apt I see as an ill Poet to mistake the Contempt and Scorn of People for Applause and Admiration  Thus far the  Gentleman Dancing Master  But tell me one thing my dear Friend has an  Owl  a dusky Countenance Most certainly a very reverend dusky Countenance Now does not an  Owl  wheresoever it appears make every mortal Smile  And now if I should call upon thee according to thy pretended desire to see what treatment a Ghost would give a Mortal I have reason to question very much whether thou wouldst appear to me for thou knowest I am in the number of those things which during thy whole  life time have always been most terrible to thee I mean in the number of thy Creditors Thou hast ow'd me these two Years twelve  Guineas  for the first Payment of twelve certain Receipts which upon taking the Receipts thou didst promise to pay in a Week But since that time I never could see either the Money or the Receipts so that if I should enquire for thee the answer that  Snug  thy Servant would make would certainly be the Ghost will not appear to Day  I am  c  LETTER IV TO Sir John Edgar  My Excellent FRIEND  _I Come now to consider thy twelfth Paper in which thou pretendst to Draw Pictures for which thou art just as much Qualifyed as thou art to Criticize for to draw Characters and to Criticize requires the same Talent that is Judgment which God and Nature have never vouchsafed to endow thee with And therefore all who know thee an errant Bungler that is all who do know thee are very well satisfyed that they are no more to expect any more Resemblance in thy Draughts than from a Sign Post Painter nay not the twentieth part so much For no Sign Post Painter was ever yet such a Blockhead as to Draw the Picture of a  Rat  when he design'd that of an  Elephant  or to Draw the Figure of an  Elephant  when he design'd that of a  Rat  But now to whom is it not known that thou hast given us the Picture of a  Wren  instead of that of  an  Eagle  and the Picture of an  Eagle  instead of that of a  Wren  And after thou hast call'd thy dead Friend  Wren  and thy self  Eagle  does not every Body know that thou hast not the knowledge of  Adam  in thee nor art qualified to give Names to Creatures agreeable to their Natures But as thou art able to draw no body no body can have any occasion to draw thee Thy Name alone is thy Picture and comprehends as severe and as entire a Satire in it as  Boileau  says that of the  Ass  does  Dont le nom seul en soy comprend une Satire  Thou canst draw no Picture but it wants a Name to distinguish it no one who names thee has occasion to draw any Picture of thee  What art not thou the famous Distinguisher the celebrated Knower of the World and of Merit who art continually endeavouring to bespatter and expose Ministers of State of admirable Abilities and who have done the most important Services for their King their Country and the whole Christian World and among whom I have convincing Reasons to believe there are such who are as much thy Superiours in solid Learning or in Polite Litterature in Wit and graceful Courtlike Behaviour and the fine Conversation of Gentlemen as they are above thee in Sagacity and Penetration in the profoundness of State Affairs and the depths of Politicks Art thou I say the famous Distinguisher the celebrated Knower of the World and of Merit who at the same time that thou art vainly and impertinently endeavouring to expose and ridicule these Illustrious Patriots art most ridiculously attempting to make two or  three paultry Players pass upon the World for Men of Manly Generous Elegant Ornamental Qualities After this need any one care whom 'tis thou Censurest and whom 'tis thou Commendest And yet to make thy Judgment manifest still further at the same time that thou art endeavouring to expose those whom the King most confides in and whom he most values thou art at every turn printing thy insipid Madrigals in the Praise of His Majesty and still the Burthen of thy Song is the same with that of an old  Starling  who is moulting his borrow'd Plumes in a Cage Dick  is a Bird for the King  Dick  is a Bird for the King  But how much preferable to thine is the Song of the  Starling  Tho it does not mean what it says like thee yet it does not like thee mean something contrary to it The Bird itself is not such a Beast as not to know that a Libel upon all a Man's best Friends can never be interpreted a Panegyrick upon the Man Thus we see that thou never Censurest and never Commendest by Reason and by Judgment because Reason and Judgment are things which thou never hadst But thy Dislike or Approbation proceeds perpetually from thy Passions thy Malice and thy Interest but especially from the last which is thy great  Diana  I come now to an Error of thy Understanding about which I shall use the more Words because thou sayst thou hast so often repeated it and that is  'tis generally for want of Judgment that Men set up for the Character of being Judicious  And here I cannot for my Soul forbear talking to thee in the Language of thy Brother of  Brentford Thou art mighty Ignorant poor Man my dear Friend is very Silly I gad he is  For to what  purpose can this jingle of Words serve but to rattle in the Noddle of a  wrongheaded  Fellow For was there ever any Mortal who was not reckon'd a Beast and an Idiot by his own Acquaintance but who set up for the Character of being Judicious in the Profession which he had embraced Does not a  Shoemaker  a  Taylor  a  Hosier  set up for the Character of being Judicious in the nature and fashion and make of Shoes and Stockings and Coats and Breeches and Cloaks Does not a  Mercer  set up for the Character of being Judicious in the nature and fashion of Stuffs and Silks and Brocades Does not a  StockJobber  or an  Exchange Broker  set up for the Character of being Judicious in the Turns the Rise and Fall of the Publick Funds When ten or more  Clergymen  Preach for a vacant Benefice does not each of them pretend to be more skilful and Judicious in the ways of Salvation than his other Antagonists Wouldst thou Fee a Lawyer in an important Cause who should tell thee seriously that he did not set up for having more Judgment than his Neighbours in Statute and Common Law Wouldst thou trust thy Life upon a dangerous Crisis in the Hands of a Physician who should assure thee that he had no more Judgment in Physick than one of his Patients But to come to Authors does not every one who publishes a Book in any Art or Science pretend to instruct at least some of his Readers But which of his Readers can he pretend to Instruct but those who are more Ignorant than himself in the matters of which he treats But if he supposes that some of his Readers are more Ignorant than himself in the matters of which he treats does not he set up for the Character of being more Judicious in those matters than they are  When  Copernicus  publish'd his System of the World did not he pretend to a little more Judgment in  Astronomy  than some who had gone before him and others who liv'd at the same time with him and who still adher'd to the  Piolemaick  System When  Des Cartes  publish'd his System of Natural Philosophy did not he by those wonderful Discoveries of the motion of the Earth and others pretend to a little more Judgment in that Science and to penetrate further into the Secrets of Nature than those who had gone before him When the Celebrated  Harvey  gave the World his Treatise of the Circulation of the Blood could he have oblig'd and adorn'd the Commonwealth of Learning by that noble and useful Discovery if he had not set up for the Character of having more Judgment in  Anatomy  than either his Predecessours or his Contemporaries And when Sir  Isac Newton  whose Merit is above what the Muses themselves can Commend oblig'd and astonish'd the Learned World by his Immortal and unparallel'd Treatises those Treatises which have made him an Honour to his Country An Advancer of the noblest Learning and an Enlarger of the Empire of the Mind what did he pretend to no more Judgment in  Mathematicks  than the herd of Mathematicians  Is it not now most apparent that every one sets up for the Character of being Judicious in his own Profession and his own Art Why then should not that be allow'd to a Poet which is granted to all the rest And why should it be denyed by thee of all Men and be denyed in a Paper in which you are doing the very same thing which you pretend to ridicule in others  For are not you pretending to write a Paper here for the Improvement ofthe Stage And how doest thou pretend to Improve it by endeavouring to impose upon the World according to thy laudable Custom and setting up for the Character of being more Judicious in Theatrical matters than most of your Readers or by speaking the Truth and telling the World that thou art a very Silly Fellow and an eternal Jabberer about matters of which thou understandest not a Syllable What is become now of that fine Maxim  that 'tis generally for want of Judgment that Men set up for the Character of being Judicious  Why thou errant Trisler Thou ridiculous  Maxim Monger  Thou hast a hundred such pretty Jingles in thy wonderful Speculations I mean the Speculations which are peculiarly thine and to which thou hast let thy Mark Maxims which are calculated for Understandings of the same Latitude with thine and which are under the same Elevation of Pole Maxims which shew'd thee as blind as  Hector  or  Pompey  or  Caesar  's Offspring that came into the World but Yesterday But as I have now some leisure to consider them I will try if by my little Art I can Couch the Cataracts of thy Understanding  But the mischief of it is that there is this difference between a four Leg'd Puppy and a two Leg'd one that whereas a four Leg'd one is Blind but for nine Days a two Leg'd one does not only come into the World Blind but for the most part continues to be Blind when he comes to be an old Dog  To this blessed Maxim thou art pleas'd to subjoyn these Words  Every body of any standing in  Town knows that the dullest and most stupid Writers we have had have set up for Criticks  why yes truly this has been the Cant for forty Years together among Persons of thy noble Understanding The Cry has gone round that 'tis impossible for any one who has shewn himself a Critick by his Prose to shew himself a good Poet by his Verse which was occasion'd first by the late Mr  Rymer  's publishing a very dull Tragedy of  Edgar  after he had publish'd a Book in Prose in which there was a great deal of good and just Criticism 'Tis true indeed  Edgar  was so absurd a Monarch that he seem'd to be a forerunning Type of thy self who wert to strut upon the Stage in the succeeding Century under the same Heroick Name From this accident the Poetasters of the Age who believ'd it their Interest to fix a Brand upon Criticism immediately cryed out and made all their Disciples repeat after them that no Critick could be a Poet not considering that one of the greatest of the  Roman  Poets and one of the greatest of the  French  were Criticks by Professon as well as Poets  and set up for the Character of being Judicious in their own Art  nay and had the Impudence to appear publickly out of Humour with some Popular Scriblers who had had Success But to return to Mr  Rymer  whether that Gentleman's ill Performance proceeded from his want of Imagination without which no Man can make a Poet let him have what Judgment he will or from his want of Exercise and Practice we should have been better able to determine if that Judicious Gentleman had writ more If Mr  Rymer  's Tragedy is an ill one neither  Shakespear  's or  Ben Johnson  's first Damatick Poems were Masterpieces and neither  Ben  nor  Shakespear  they had left nothing behind them but these  would have pass'd with Posterity tor great Poets But whatever was the Reason of Mr  Rymer  's Miscarriage if these Authors had only infer'd from it that a Man may sometimes have the Theory of an Art which yet he may not be fully qualifyed to practice with Success nothing could have been more just But for them to draw not only a general Inference from a particular Fact but an Inference so very absurd as that a Man cannot Practice an Art with Success for no other reason but because he has shewn that he Understands it was Bestial and Abominable I am afraid my dear Friend that it will be found upon enquiry that the very contrary of this is an eternal Truth He who Practices an Art with Success which he does not understand is most infallibly an ill Artist notwithstanding all his Success and is indebted for that Success to the gross Ignorance and Barbarity of those whom he has the Luck to please  If ever that Assertion that the dullest and most stupid Writers which we have had have set up for Criticks is prov'd it must be by thy Example For as there is not one Author alive who has set up for Criticism so much as thou hast there is not in all  Great Britain  so stupid and so dull a Writer as thou art when thou art left to thy self  To make good both the Branches of this Assertion when old  Bickerstaff  publish'd his  Tatlers  did he set up for a Critick did he set up for the Character of being Judicious or not Let us see what he says himself in his Dedication to the late Mr  Maynwaring  The general purpose of this Paper is to expose the false Arts of Life and to pull off the Disguises of Cunning Vanity and Affectation and to recommend a general Simplicity in our Dress our Discourse and our Behaviour No Man has a better Judgment for the Discovery or a nobler Spirit for the Contempt of all Imposture than your self which Qualities render you the most proper Patron for the Author of these Essays  Thus far old  Bickerstaff  Now this as I take it is setting▪ up for something more than the Character of being barely Judicious tis setting up for Sagacity tis setting up for Penetration which are the Accomplishments and the Perfections of Judgment Now if it be true that 'tis generally for want of Judgment that a Man sets up for the Character of being Judicious what shall we say of the Man who sets up for the Character of Sagacity for the Character of Penetration For such a one arrogates a hundred times more to himself than one who sets up for the Character of being barely Judicious in passing his Judgment on the Works of Authors To know the Hearts of Men requires infinitely more Capacity than barely to know Books A Book alas has but one meaning whatever it speaks it thinks But the Heart of Man has Folds and Doubles and Recesses innumerable Yet thro' all these hast thou pretended to pierce and consequently hast pretended to Criticism of a nobler and more difficult Nature than any Author living But though thou didst pretend to do all this what thou really didst of it was by the Sagacity and Penetration of others And when thou hadst got ingenious Tools to write thee into  an Income of two Thousand Pounds a Year thou coulst not be satisfyed till like the most dull and stupid of all Writers thou hadst writ thy self out of it again  The Courtship which Sir  Martin Marall  made to Mrs  Millesant  and that which thou didst formerly make to Dame  Fortune  and to Madam  Fame  will certainly make a Parallel that will run upon all Four Sir  Martin  had a mind to Mrs  Millesant  but not having Capacity nor Address to gain her he prevail'd upon  Warner  to do that for him but to do it in such a way that Sir  Martin  was to have the Credit and the Benefit of it Now the Lady being a Lover of Musick Sir  Martin  was to give her a Lesson upon the  Theorbo  and a Song In order to this Sir  Martin  is to appear in a Balcony at a distance from her with a Lute in his Hand and the Motions of a Thrummer and the Grimaces of a Singer while  Warner  is to Sing and to Play for him behind the Curtain Well All this was very well concerted but the Success of all was to depend upon the Signal agreed upon between them and that was that Sir  Martin  should leave off his Grimaces and his Thrummings upon his dumb Lute upon the Ringing of a Bell But the foolish Knight was so full of his Mistress and himself that tho' the Bell rung twice yet his Hand and Jaws still went and expos'd him to the Scorn of his Mistress and the Chambermaid  I will leave thee my dear Friend to apply all this to thy self But I cannot forbear taking notice that it was very imprudent in thee not to leave off upon the Bells ringing twice that is upon the Bell that rung for Mr  Maynwaring  's and Mr  Addison  's Funeral  I come now to some of the pretended Facts of which thou hast been pleased to accuse me and I will begin with that which relates to Mr  Congreve  and Mr  Addison  upon whom thou sayst I have been more severe than upon any other Persons As for being severe upon Mr  Congreve  tis a figure in Speech which  Jeremy  says in  Love for Love  interlards the greatest part of his Conversation As for Mr  Addison  I must confess I did write the  Remarks upon Cato  but I did not basely flatter and sawn upon Mr  Addison  while he was living and then more basely insult him as soon as he was Dead I did not while he was living write a flattering fulsom Dedication to him in which I made him a Thousand times greater than my self and then as soon as he was Dead write a flattering fulsom Dedication to my self in which I made my self a Thousand times greater than him A little below there is another extraordinary Figure where thou pretendst to insinuate that I have been us'd by some People so as a Man of Honour ought not to be us'd Who are those People Thou canst not thou darest not name them Because then the Lye would appear too gross and palpable I'll tell thee whom I have us'd at that rate and that is thy Friend thy Priest thy Worshipper thy Viceroy Thou either knowest or oughtest to know that I have beat him and I do not know but I might have been provok'd to do as much by his Wooden God if he had dar'd to offer to my Face what he has basely writ Thou sayst that my Pamphlet is so cruel that it could be writ by none but a Coward I believe I have given other sort of Proofs of my Courage than one who in the time of a Bloody War for twenty Years together took the King's Pay as a Soldier  and never was in any Action than one who for twenty Years together fought as he writ by Proxy The Cruelty of a Coward consists not in Words but Actions Then then was the Cruelty then was the Cowardice when upon a certain Night in  November  last three villanous FootPads rob'd a poor defenceless Passenger of all that he had and said that they did it by a Deputation from thee And thou wert afterwards pleas'd to abet this Action and call those FootPads Men of Manly Elegant Generous Ornamental Qualities  Hinc illae Lachrymoe  From hence arose those  Crocodile  Tears which thou hast shew'd in some of thy Papers  Didst thou not snew thy Courage in a notable manner by giving such Language in thy  Theatres  after having declar'd against single Combat by thy Lucubrations and against Siege and Battle by thy Conduct Was it not Bravely and Heroically done to call upon both the Living and the Dead to revenge thy Cause upon one of Sixty Five and to endeavour to set both the  King  's Horse and Foot Guards upon one of Sixty Five For my part I have always firmly believ'd that I have more true Courage than any one than whom I have more Understanding For if Fortitude is a Virtue of which I know no Man who doubts it must depend upon the Reason and not upon the Complexion but if it depends upon the Reason then the stronger the Reason is the stronger must be the Virtue And I have always thought that as God and Nature have given to Man the Dominion over Beast they have so far given to reasonable Men the Dominion over Blockheads that they are rather born to scorn them than to fear them And I appeal to all my Acquaintance in Town of whom there are several  living of and Years standing if these Sentiments were ever contradicted by any Action or Accident of my Life  But if by the continual Fears thou hast given me thou meanst as thou seemst to insinuate my apprehensions of Persons to whom I may owe Money thou of all Men hast as little reason to upbraid me with these Fears as the others For who was it that lay skulking so many Years at the  Tiltyard Sutlers  when he was so strongly possess'd with Fear that he could not think himself in safety unless he had the Horse and FootGuards for his Security When the late facetious  Daniel Purcel  gave him the name of Major General  Hide  and the chief Maxim of his Life seem'd to be  Qui latuit bene vixit  If I had the Misfortune to be an Insolvent Debtor I should have this Apology to make for my self that my Insolvency would not be owing to any Extravagance or want of taking Pains but to the hard not to say the unjust Usage which I have met with in the World and in great part to your Injustice and Barbarity and the Injustice and Barbarity of those who deriv'd their Power from you The being an Insolvent Debtor is rather to be pitied than condemn'd when it has not been occasion'd either by Profuseness or Idleness but tho being in Debt is both odious and contemptible in one who is at the same time a Squanderer a Bankrupt and an Oppressor But yet to shew you that I am not in the condition which you imagine I have for these last four Years lodg'd continually in the Neighbourhood of  Whitehall  and I appeal to the Honourable Board of Greencloth if during that time so much as one Complaint as been preferr'd against me  I should now say something of the Falshoods of which you accuse me in my two former Letters and of the Ingratitude of which thou pretendest to accuse me for writing against those who have endeavour'd to serve me As these two Letters will be shortly follow'd by a  Fifth  and a  Sixth  I shall endeavour to shew in them who are the Lovers of Truth and who are the Slanderers who are the Benefactors and who the Unjust and Oppressors And then if with thy little Understanding thou hast not lost all Sense of Shame I shall cause thy dusky Countenance to turn Red as the Morning does or as a  Lobster  boil'd  But having said more already than I design'd to do at present and you having heard more than thou hadst a mind to hear I shall take my leave for a little time only adding that as thou hast form'd a Fantom in thy Mind which thou wouldst pass upon the World for thy Friend and which every impartial Man who has seen it has declar'd to be just as like to me as a  Wren  is like to the late Mr  Addison  or as thou art like to an  Eagle  I shall by way of Gratitude or Acknowledgment subjoin to these Letters the Picture of my dear Friend and I appeal to all who shall see it if I am not the happier Painter of the two and draw the livelier Resemblance And so at present my very worthy Friend I heartily bid thee Farewel  THE PICTURE OF Sir John Edgar  _SIR  John Edgar  the County of in  Ireland  is of a middle Stature broad Shoulders thick Legs a Shape like the Picture of  somebody  over a Farmers Chimney a short Chin a short Nose a short Forehead a broad flat Face and a dusky Countenance He us'd to compare himself to an  Eagle  and to oblige the first Fool that he met with to give it under his Hand that he was so But neither his Nose nor his Eyes nor his Discernment nor his broad flat Face nor his dusky Countenance were held to be Aquiline He was believ'd to be in all these more like to another Bird than an  Eagle  Yet with such a Shape and such a Face he discover'd at Sixty that he took himself for a Beauty and appear'd to be more mortify'd upon his being told he was Ugly than he was by any reflection that was ever made upon his Honour or his Understanding  He is a Gentleman born Witness himself of a very Honourable Family certainly of a very Ancient one For his Ancestours flourish'd in  Tipperary  long before the  English  ever set Foot in  Ireland  He has Testimony of this more Authentick than the  Heralds  Office or than any Human Testimony for God has mark'd him more abundantly than he did  Cain  and stamp'd his Native Country upon his Face his Understanding his Writings his Actions his Passions and above all his Vanity The  Hibernian  Brogue is still upon all these tho long Habitude and length of Days have worn it from off his Tongue  He is the greatest Pretender but one of the Age in which he lives a Pretender both to Understanding and Virtue but especially to the latter But some malicious People have thought that he made constant Court to that venerable Lady not out of any Affection which he had for her Person but because he was struck by the Charms of the Joynture which he believ'd might follow her And they were confirm'd in this Opinion by observing the Quarrels which he had every Day with one or other of her four Daughters Yet this pretended Passion did him great Service It was to him  Major Domo Factotum Housekeeper Cook Butler Taylor  and  Sempstress  because we live in a noble Climate where Persons who are universally known to be Cheats and Sharpers keep their Coaches by being so  Yet to one of the Daughters of that venerable Lady he paid great respect in Publick  videlicet  to Madam  Justice  And to gain her Favour and obtain her Protection he thought it not beneath him to admit the meanest of her Servants and Officers into the greatest familiarity with him So that there was no respect of Persons among them But it was  Jack  and  Tom  and  Will  and  Hal  and  Dick  with them But he always combin'd with these her Servants to injure and abuse her in Private and unknown to her play'd a hundred Pranks with them to the prejudice  of her Interest and Reputation which were not long kept so very Private but the World took notice that neither he nor the Servants car'd one Farthing for the Mistress they pretended to serve He would very often do Extravagant things very seldom Generous ones and never by his good will Just ones Yet was he a great pretender to Generosity but Generosity with him was squandring away his Money upon Knaves and Fools who flatter'd him Thus a Bubble is a very generous Creature to the  Shark  who preys upon him and a Beggar is generous to the Vermin that feed upon him  He had that seeming respect for the Laws of his Country and appear'd to be so delighted with them that tho' he had the Happiness of enjoying them as much as the most zealous of his Fellow Subjects even as those to whom one may say the Zeal of the Law hath eaten them up yet that he might be sure the Correspondence between them might be for Life he had thro' a greatness of Soul peculiar to him assum'd a noble Resolution that would never suffer him to pay any one a Farthing 'till it came to Execution Yet notwithstanding all this he was not satisfy'd but was always crying out Law Law more Law more Law  He appears to be mighty zealous for the Rights of the People and to be terribly afraid of the return of the old Aristocracy by which he has got the nick Name with some of  Aristocracy Edgar  No Man had ever so much in his Mouth Benevolence and Beneficence to Mankind as he which to his Creditors seems a great Fable For say they since he hates us who have most oblig'd him to that degree that he cannot endure to see our Faces how can he possibly love the rest He us'd one while to call himself the  Christian  Heroe  till it grew a publick Jest For the People would not allow him to be a Heroe because tho he had been a Soldier so many Years in the time of a Bloody War he never had been present either at Siege or Battle and he could not possibly they us'd to say be a Christian because he us'd constantly to spend the Mornings in Cursing  the Houshold of Faith  tho' they came in shoals to his Levees out of pure Zeal to exhort him to do his Duty  He valued himself exceedingly upon being a great Improver and a great Reformer tho' the truth of the matter is that he never had half Skill enough to improve any thing nor half Virtue enough to reform any thing During the time that he was Governour of the  BearGarden  the Diversions of that place were more Stupid and Barbarous than ever they were known to be before and the wild Beasts more mischievous and untractable And he was especially so far from Reforming any thing that it was generally observ'd that the greater part of those who had been most intimate with him were very far from being more Virtuous than their Neighbours tho' he never fail'd of doing one thing in order to the making them so and that is entring them in the School of Adversity  Now as for  Temperance  another Daughter of the abovementioned venerable Lady he caresses and courts her all the livelong Day and compliments her as the Queen of Morals and the Empress of Life But as soon as the Night approaches then sparkling Champaign puts an end to her Reign  He judiciously believes that by preaching Abstinence up by Daylight he has made an honourable Composition for his drinking three Bottles by Candlelight  We may say of his Fortitude What  Butler  said of  Hudibras  's Wit He may be Master of a very great deal but thro' abundance of Modest'y is shie of making any Parade of it but reserves it for an occasion which no body can diving For he has declar'd against single Combat by his Writings and against Siege and Battle by his Conduct and Actions that is by staying at home in a time of War with a Commission in a Pennyless Pocket and choosing rather to run the Risk of being taken Prisoner by the  English  than of being kill'd by the  French  Now as for  Prudence  the fourth Daughter he has a Magnanimity which teaches him utterly to despise her and to regard her as an abandon'd Person that prostitutes her self to the lowest Mechanicks He therefore makes it the business of his Life to Affront her and abuses her in all his Conversation his Writings and his Actions of which there can be ho stronger Testimony than his mortally disobliging his cordial tho' partial Friends who rais'd him and going over to a Party whom he had exasperated beyond any possibility of a sincere Reconcilement  He is so great a Friend to Union that almost all Orders and Ranks of Men are united in his Person For he has been Poet Orator Soldier Officer Projector Newsmonger Casuist Scribe Politician Fish monger Knight▪ and Gold finder and what is never enough to be admir'd he has been all these by virtue of other Mens Capacities Like a very Patentee he has perform'd the Functions of all these by Proxy and by Deputy As an Author he Writ by Proxy as a Soldier by proxy he fought He is so given to do every thing by Proxy and by Deputy that one would swear he lies with his Mistress by Proxy and by Deputy as several honest  worthy Gentlemen of his Antiquity are us'd to lie with theirs  Tho no Man in  Great Britain  is so fit a Subject for Satire as himself yet has he been always writing Waggish Lampoons upon others And whenever he exposes a Lord in one of his Libels he has got a trick of affronting him ten times more by way of begging his Pardon  He has been always begging something of the Government and tho he has obtain'd ten times more of it than he deserv'd yet he grumbling thinks they have given him nothing because he has retain'd nothing and is outragiously angry with some of the great Officers of the Crown because they have refus'd to wast the whole time of their Administration in  pouring Water into a Sieve  He had one while as I hinted above obtain'd a Patent to be Governour of the  BearGarden  tho that Patent was invalid and void by vertue of a previous Statute Yet when he thought himself establish'd in that Post he chose a  Bear  a  Baboon  and a  Wolf  for his Deputy Governours but partly growing Lazy and being partly convinc'd that the Deputies were fitter for Government than the Principal he abandon'd all to them who conducting themselves by their Bestial Appetites play'd such Pranks that both Governours and Deputies were all remov'd and the  BearGarden  turn'd into a  Theatre  Which Conduct of his puts me in mind of one  Sempronius  a  Roman  Knight who was made Director of the  Ludi Fescennini  a rough sort of  BearGarden  Drama in use among the uncultivated  Romans  before they were polish'd by the  Grecian  Arts into which Employment he introduc'd three Wretches as his Deputies who were the utter ruin of that Diversion For thess four Persons had not among them all as much Judgment as a  Ballad maker  And yet  upon having this paultry Office conferr'd upon him  Sempronius  most vainly and impertinently usurp'd the name of  Censor  which coming to alarm the true  Censors  they enquir'd into his Life upon which finding him to be the greatest  Fourbe  and the greatest Impostor that had appear'd among them since the Foundation of the City they turn'd him with Disgrace out of his Government dismounted him and took his Horse from him and not contented with this banish'd him from  Rome  it self and upon his Departure caus'd the same general Lustration to be made that was us'd when a certain boding broad flat duskyfac'd Prodigy had been hooted from out the Walls  Postscript  IF upon perusing this piece of Painting or upon reading the preceeding Letters any honest impartial Gentlemen shall say as they did upon reading the two Former that I ought not to enter into the private Concerns of Life I desire them to consider that these Letters tho written in Prose were design'd to be Just and Legitimate Satires and that the private Concerns of Life are the just and adaequate Subjects of Satire and make the chief Beauties of the ancient Satirists that is of  Lucilius Horace Persius  and  Juvenal  The unmasking of Hypocrites is the great business of Satire according to that of  Horace  in the first Satire of his Second Book  Est Lucilius ausus  Primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem  Detrabere pellem nitidus quâ quisque per ora  Cederet introrsum Turpis  But how is it possible for the most part to unmask a Hypocrite without entring into the private Concerns of Life  Juvenal  tells us in his first Satire that all Human Actions all the Passions of Men all their Desires and all their Inclinations are the constant Subjects of his Satire  Quidquid agunt Homines votum timor ira voluptas  Gaudia Discursus nostri est farrago Libelli  Now will any one pretend that the private Concerns of Life are not included in these Verses  I must confess the celebrated  French  Satirist has been a little more retentive but yet they must know very little of him who are to be told that he sometimes enters into the private Concerns of Life which once more are the just and adaequate Subjects of Satire But then the Satirist ought to take care that the Censures are always Just and that either the Vices Satiriz'd are very Flagrant and of pernicious Example or the Persons egregious Hypocrites  FINIS
