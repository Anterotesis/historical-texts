 THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  VOL VI  THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  'TIS SO PAT TO ALL THE TRIBE EACH CRIES THAT WAS LEVELLED AT ME  GAY  VOLUME VI  LONDON  PRINTED FOR G G AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTERROW AND SHEPPERSON AND REYNOLDS NO OXFORDSTREET  THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  CHAP I A NEW AND BOLD PROJECT CONCEIVED AND EXECUTED BY WAKEFIELD THE DIFFICULTY OF MAKING PRINCIPLES AGREE WITH PRACTICE DISCUSSED FAIR PROMISES ON THE PART OF AN OLD OFFENDER THE HOPES THEY EXCITE AND THE FEARS THAT ACCOMPANY THEM  THE affair of the pamphlet being removed from my mind I had leisure to attend to the other difficulty that had lately crossed me by the possession which Wakefield had illegally taken of effects which he asserted to be his in the double right of being heir to his uncle and the husband of my mother but which if my information were true appertained to me  It may well be supposed I communicated all my thoughts to friends like Evelyn Wilmot and Turl and endeavoured to profit by their advice  Law had lately undergone a serious examination from us all and it was then the general opinion among us that though it was impossible to avoid appealing to it on some occasions yet nothing but the most urgent cases could justify such appeals Enquiries that were to be regulated not by a spirit of justice but by the disputatious temper of men whose trade it was to deceive and by statutes and precedents which they might or might not remember and which though they might equivocally and partially apply in some points in others had no resemblance such enquiries ought not lightly to be instituted Neither ought the habitual vices which they engender both in lawyer and client nor the miseries they inflict upon the latter  in particular and by their consequences upon all society to be promoted  In the course of the conversation at the tavern when I dined and spent the afternoon with the false Belmont this subject among others had occurred Having told him that I had quitted all thoughts of the law he enquired into my motives and being full of the subject and zealous to detail its whole iniquity I not only urged the reasons that most militate against it both in principle and practice but in the warmth of argument declared that I doubted whether any man could bring an action against another without being guilty of injustice I considered crime and error as the same The structure of law I argued was erroneous therefore criminal and I protested against the attempting to redress a wrong already committed by the commission of more wrong  The death of Thornby happened immediately  after this conversation took place and it is not to be supposed that a man like my young but inventive fatherinlaw could forget or fail in endeavouring to profit by such an incident  One morning while at breakfast I received a note from him signed Belmont in which he requested me again to dine and spend the afternoon with him alleging that an event had taken place in which he was deeply interested adding that he had been lately led to reflect on many of the remarks I had made and that he hoped the period was come when he should be able to change the system to which I was so inimical for one that better agreed with my own sentiments but that my advice was particularly necessary on the present occasion  The note gave me pleasure That a man with such powers of mind and charms of conversation should have only a chance of changing from what he was  to what I hoped was delightful And that he should call upon me for advice at such a juncture was flattering  I answered that an engagement already formed prevented me from meeting him on that day but I appointed the next morning for an interview Dining I declined as a hint that I disapproved the attempt he had made to entrap me  The engagement I had was to accompany Lady Bray to one of the families acquainted with the Mowbrays and where it was expected we should meet Olivia and her aunt This expectation which kept my spirits in a flutter the whole day and increased to alarm and dread in the evening was disappointed Whether from any real or a pretended accident on the part of the aunt who sent an apology was more than I had an opportunity to know  I kept my appointment on the following morning and was rather surprised  when we met at perceiving that the still pretended Belmont like myself was in deep mourning I began to make enquiries to which he gave short answers and turning the interrogatories upon me asked which of my relations was dead"  "My mother"  "Oh I remember Mrs Wakefield Are you still as angry with her husband as ever"  "I really cannot tell Though I have what most people would think much greater cause"  "Indeed What has he done more"  "Taken possession of property which is mine"  "By what right is it yours"  "It was bequeathed me by my grandfather and since that by his executor"  "The uncle of this Wakefield I think you told me"  "Yes A lawyer One Thornby who was induced by deathbed terrors to  restore what he had robbed me of while living"  "That is he lived a knave and died a fool and a fanatic"  "I suspect that he died as he had lived Knavery and fanaticism are frequently coupled"  "And how do you intend to proceed"  "I do not know I have not yet consulted a lawyer"  "Consulted a lawyer You surprise me When last I saw you I was half convinced by you that a man cannot justly seek redress at law Its sources you proved to be corrupt its powers inadequate and its decisions never accurate therefore never just This was your language You reprobated those accommodating rules by which I endeavoured to obtain happiness and urged arguments that made a deep impression upon me Now that selfinterest gives you an impulse are your principles become as  pliant as mine which you so seriously reproved"  I paused and then replied"I imagine you take some delight in having found an opportunity of retorting upon me and of laughing at what you still consider as folly"  "Indeed you mistake I hope by reminding you of your own doctrine to induce you to put it in practice The virtue that consists only in words is but a vapour"  "Surely you will allow this is an extreme if not a doubtful case I do not mean to commence an action till I have considered it very seriously but I presume you do not require infallibility of me Or if you do it is what I cannot expect from myself I have frequently been led to doubt whether principles the most indubitable must not bend to the mistakes and institutions of society This doubt is to me the most painful that can  cross the mind but it is one from which I cannot wholly escape"  "Your tone I find is greatly altered How strenuous how firm how founded were all your maxims when last we met"  "And so I am persuaded the maxims of truth will always remain"  "Then why depart from them Another of them which I likewise recollect to have heard from you is that the laws which pretend to regulate property whether by will entail or any other descent are all unjust for that effects of all kinds should be so appropriated as to produce the greatest good"  "I do not see how that can be denied But this is strongly to the point in my favour as I suppose for the institutes of society render the application of the principle impracticable and therefore I think the property may have a greater chance of being applied to a good purpose if  allotted to me than if retained by this Wakefield whose vices are extraordinary"  "You believe him to be a man of some talent"  "All that know him affirm his understanding would be of the first order were it worthily employed"  "Then would it not be a good application of the property in contest if it should both enable and induce him so to employ his understanding"  "Oh of that there is no hope"  How do you know I believe you have thought the same of me but you may chance to be mistaken And now I will tell you a secret I am in the very predicament of this Wakefield A relation is dead who has left his property away from me by what right is more than I can discover at least in the spirit of those laws which pretend to regulate such matters for their spirit is force  Lands wrested from the helpless they consign to the robber I am in possession and doubt whether even according to your code I ought to resign I certainly ought not according to my own I will acknowledge to you that I think well of the man who claims the property I withhold But I cannot think so well of him as of myself for I cannot be so well acquainted with his thoughts as with my own I know my own wants my own powers and my own plans I should be glad to do him good but I should be sorry to do myself ill You accuse me of having fallen into erroneous habits of making false calculations and of tasting pleasures that are dangerous and of short duration I have ridiculed your arguments but I have not forgotten them Neither has the enquiring spirit that is abroad been unknown to or unnoticed by me Early powers of mind gave me the early means of indulgence I revelled  in pleasure squandered all I could procure and was led by one successful artifice to another till I became what I can certainly no otherwise justify than by the selfish spirit of the world In this I find the rule is for each to seize on all that he can with safety and to swallow hoard or waste it at will I have attempted to profit by vice which I knew not how to avoid But if there be a safer road to happiness I am no idiot I am as desirous of pursuing it as you can be The respect of the world the security from pains and penalties and the approbation of my own heart are all of them as dear to me as to you I have thought much have had much experience and have the power of comparing facts and sensations as largely perhaps as another  I will not deny that to trick selfishness by its own arts to laugh at its stupidity and to outwit its contemptible cunning are practices that have tickled  my vanity and have perhaps formed one of my chief sources of pleasure But habit and pleasure led me to extend such projects and to prey upon the wellmeaning and the kind with almost as much avidity as on those of an opposite character  However though I did not want plausible arguments in my own justification I cannot affirm that my heart was wholly at ease New thoughts have occurred other prospects have been contemplated and my dissatisfaction has increased You cannot but have remarked that in the course of human life most men undergo more than one remarkable change The sober man becomes a drunkard the drunkard sober and the spendthrift sometimes a rational economist though perhaps more frequently a miser  Yet though I am disposed to alter  my conduct supposing me to possess the means of bidding defiance to mankind I have no inclination to subject myself to their neglect their pity or their scorn Be it want of courage or want of wisdom I have not an intention to shut myself out from society If I may be admitted on fair and liberal terms I am content but I honestly tell you admitted I will be I have shut the door of dependency upon myself were I so inclined Offices of trust would not be committed to me And to live rejected in poverty and wretchedness pointed at and pretended to be despised by the knaves and fools with whom the world is filled is a condition to which I will never submit  Consequently the property of which I have possessed myself I am in either case determined to use every effort to keep If I am suffered to keep it quietly my present inclinations are what I have been  describing If contention must come we must then have a trial of skill upon the opposite system  I listened to this discourse attentive to every sentence anxious for the next and agitated by various contradictory emotions I saw the difficulties of the supposed case and knew not what to answer or what to advise That a man like this should become what he seemed half to promise was a thought that consoled and expanded the heart But that it should depend upon so improbable an event as that of another renouncing a claim which the law gave him to property in dispute was a most painful alternative My sensations were of hope suddenly kindled and as suddenly killed  After waiting some time without any reply from me he added "Let us suppose Mr Trevor a whimsical or if you please a strange coincidence between the man with whom you have been so angry  and myself I mean Wakefield What if he felt some of the sober propensities toward which I find a kind of a call in myself"  "He is not to be trusted In him it would be artifice or at least nobody would believe it could be any thing else"  "Mark now what chance there is in a world like this for a man whom it has once deemed criminal to reform Oppressed insulted and pursued by the good what resource has he but to associate with the wicked"  "He that with the fairest seeming and the most specious pretences affirming time after time that though he had deceived before he now was honest he that shall yet again and again repeat his acts of infamy cannot complain if no man should be willing to trust his happiness to such keeping"  "I find what I am to expect from you The very same will be said of me"  "No you have not been equally unprincipled and vile"  "These are coarse or at least harsh terms However I take them to myself and affirm that I have"  "How can you make such an affirmation How do you know"  "A man may calculate on probabilities and this is a moment in which I do not wish to conceal the full estimate which I make of my own conduct from you Being therefore seriously and speaking to the best of my judgment as culpable as Wakefield let my course of life hereafter be what it will I find I am to expect no credit for sincerity from you"  "You do not know Wakefield"  "Neither it seems do you"  "There is something in your countenance in your conversation and in the free and undisguised honesty even of your vices that a man like Wakefield cannot possess"  "Have you forgotten that though I can be open and honest I can be artful Do you not remember billiards hazard and Bath"  "Yes but Wakefield would be incapable of the qualities of mind which you are now displaying With you I feel myself in the company of a man of a perverted but a magnanimous spirit With all your faults I could hug you to my heart But Wakefield who made women and men alike his prey to whose devilish arts the virtue and happiness of an amiable I may say a charming woman were sacrificed and the life of one of the first of mankind was endangered that he should resemble you and especially that he should resemble you with your present inclinations oh would that were possible"  "There is generosity in the wish It denotes a power in you of allaying one of the most active fiends that torment mankind the spirit of revenge"  "It is a spirit I own to which I have been too subject and which I could wish to exorcise for ever"  "Put it to the test Let us suppose you should discover as much of promise in Wakefield as you imagine you do in me"  "I should then put  him  to the test I should demand of him to repair the wrongs he has done Miss Wilmot"  "What if you should find him already so disposed"  "Impossible Or if he were it would be with some design"  "Ay perhaps a proposition that you should leave him quietly possessed of the disputed property"  "And having obtained that he would desert his second wife as he had done his first"  "There is some difference between a young woman and an old one Beside if your account be true Mrs Wakefield  though she was your mother was very inferior to Miss Wilmot"  "You forget that he seduced this lady and deserted her"  "I have heard or read of a man who after being divorced even from a wife became more passionately in love with her than ever"  "Wakefield is incapable of love"  "You frame to yourself a most black and deformed being of this Wakefield"  "And you suppose a degree of sympathy between yourself and him which cannot exist"  "Why not His wit person and manners I have heard you describe as winning"  "I only gave the picture which I had from an affectionate though a most injured woman"  "I recollect the story perfectly When you repeated it notwithstanding my raillery I was more moved than you had  reason to imagine I am persuaded that Wakefield himself had he listened to it would have felt a few uneasy sensations"  "I fear not"  "Why so Is he made of materials totally different from other men Dissect him and I imagine you will find he has a heart"  "But of what quality"  "Better than you at present seem to give him credit for"  "What grounds have you for thinking so favourably of him"  "Very excellent Don't be surprised I know the man"  "Is it possible"  "Where is the wonder Knaves of other classes associate and why should not gamblers"  "It may be then you are deputed to speak in his behalf"  "I wrote to you and introduced this  conversation for that very purpose I know him as intimately as I can know any man I would speak of him as of myself of his defects as of my own and I declare it as my opinion that if he might be permitted to enjoy his uncle's property in peace he would change his system To this property he supposes he has the best claim He is Thornby's heir at law and as to the manner in which the wealth he left was acquired if a general inquisition were made into the original right to every species of property he is persuaded that ninetynine rich men in a hundred would be turned into the streets to beg"  What you have related has greatly surprised me You have pleaded and continue to plead his cause very powerfully but have you no consideration for me Granting all you have supposed in his favour possible am I so situated as to justify a romantic renunciation of claims  which if asserted may aid me to accomplish my dearest hopes  To a man like you perhaps I could be contented to resign these claims I need not say 'perhaps' I am certain I could were I thoroughly persuaded you would forsake a life of artifice and plunder and were I myself only concerned  But that is not the case I have an object to accomplish so dear to my heart that it swallows up lesser considerations and will not allow me to neglect any honest means by which it may be promoted Wealth to me is indispensible wealth that shall place me on a level with a rich and proud family with which I have to contend I have an impulse such perhaps as you have never felt There is a woman in the world endowed with such qualities that to say I passionately love her is a most impotent expression of what I feel for to tenderness and ardour of affection must be added  all that simplicity purity and grandeur of soul can inspire To think of life without her is to think of a world sterile desolate and joyless of a night to which day shall never succeed and of existence arrested and chained in motionless despondency  "Which might be very pitiful or very sublime just as you please but which would be very absurd"  "Granted but this is the fever of my mind the disease to which should my hopes be disappointed I feel myself dangerously impelled"  "The interpretation of all which is that though you have discovered principles which if pursued would secure to yourself and mankind in general certain happiness and that though you can deal forth their dogmas and point out the path which others indubitably ought to take yet when your own passions are concerned you act like the rest of the  world And you do this not blindly as they do but with your eyes open at the moment that you are reminded of your maxims and acknowledge their truth"  "Your accusation is premature I have hitherto done nothing more than express my feelings and my doubts"  "But these doubts spurred on by these feelings assure me that you will proceed against Wakefield"  "You may think yourself assured I conceive myself to be uncertain I would willingly condemn myself to great punishment were it to promote any plan of the goodness of which there should be a conviction I can even suppose cases in which I would not only devote my life for that in comparison appears to be a trifle but would resign the woman whom my soul adores Sacrifices like these however cannot be expected on light occasions The good to be obtained ought  to be evidently greater than the evil to be endured"  He paused a moment to collect his ideas and then replied  "If Mr Trevor you are the man of that eminent virtue which I have sometimes thought you and to which by your discourse to me you have certainly made very lofty pretensions I would advise you to reflect on what I shall once more state I know that this Wakefield of whom you think so ill and who has been quite as guilty as you have supposed is now inclined to be a different man I would have you consider first to whom does the property in justice belong I think you will find that to be doubtful Next supposing it to be legally yours may you not nevertheless be defrauded of it by law And lastly appeal to your own principles and ask yourself whether it be not better that you should have a chance of doing the good which you conceive  would be done by recovering such a man as Wakefield to that respect in society by which his talents might be well employed or whether it can be consistent with your own sense of right to take methods which you acknowledge to be precarious and unjust in order to dispossess him and to appropriate that to yourself to which if you are impartial you will perhaps find it difficult to prove even to your own satisfaction that you have a clear and undoubted claim"  Through this whole scene instead of diverting my attention from the argument by gay raillery witty allusions or a recurrence to the depravity of man and the practice of the world he kept closely to the question preserved the tone of earnest discussion and having uttered what I have last repeated took his leave with that serious air which he had thus unexpectedly assumed and maintained  CHAP II THE PLAN OF WAKEFIELD PURSUED AND THE HOPES AND FEARS OF AN AFFECTIONATE WOMAN NEWS OF PHILIP AN ARTLESS EXCULPATORY TALE  QUITTING the place meditating on the scene that had passed surprised at every part of it at the interested manner of the man at the intimate knowledge which he professed to have of Wakefield at the promises and the threats which he appeared to make in his name at the coincidence not only of their characters if his account were true but at their similar incidents of fortune and corresponding inclinations to reform astonished while I recollected these various particulars instead of returning immediately to my lodgings I called on Miss Wilmot  When I came to the door I had  scarcely decided with myself whether it were advisable to relate what had passed to her which as she was personally in question I thought myself bound to do whenever it could be done with safety or whether if related at present it might not excite hopes that would be disappointed and anxieties prejudicial to her peace  She no sooner saw me than she exclaimed"I am very glad you are come Mr Trevor I have two unexpected affairs on which I wish to consult you One of them relates to myself and I will begin with that because you are not only concerned in it but are appealed to in a very remarkable manner I have received two extraordinary letters by both of which I have been not a little affected Pray read this first It is from Mr Wakefield The promises it contains the style it assumes and the  appeal it makes are so strange as to appear either like miracle or romance"  She then gave me a letter and I read as follows  Should you imagine Lydia that because I have long forborn all intercourse with you I have forgotten you be assured you are mistaken I have treated you so shamefully and deceived you so often that I have little right to expect you should believe my professions be moved by my intreaties or remember me with any other feelings than those of hatred Yet to deal sincerely with you this is what I do not expect I have had such proofs of the kindness of your heart and the strength of your affection that my confidence is still entire  It is the more unshaken because my own intentions are direct of which the plainness with which I shall deliver my thoughts will I imagine be some proof  I once more repeat I have behaved to you like a Spare me the word It is enough to recollect that I have been the thing I could plead the extreme vivacity of my youth my ungovernable passions and the dangerous temptation of critical moments but that I will not exhibit any feature of pitiful apology or endeavour to extenuate what I cannot defend  You are intimate with Mr Trevor You know that his mother my late wife is dead and you have heard of a will said to have been left by my uncle I feel but little scruple in affirming that I imbibed many of the vices of my early youth from being placed under this uncle's care That such a man should die like a coward and endeavour to disinherit a relation to save his soul supposing this disinheritance to be true would be no miracle It would only be an act of contemptible stupidity  I will not here enter into any enquiries of a legal kind for I will be open enough to own that being in possession both in right of my wife and as the heir of my uncle of the property he left and determined as I am to assert my claims which I think paramount to those of any other person I will not commit myself even to you On the contrary I write this letter purposely that you may shew it to Mr Trevor  You will ask my motive for this and perhaps will be surprised at my answer  By certain whimsical accidents I have become acquainted with Mr Trevor's principles I believe or I rather know him to be possessed of a heart and understanding equally excellent I wish to appeal to them both When he shall read this he will have had a conversation relating to me which may have led him to expect the language I am about to use  In an argument concerning property he cannot forget that he lately delivered himself thus  'If I strictly adhere to the principle of justice I must not singly consider my own wishes which may create innumerable false wants and crave to have them gratified I must ask is there no being within my knowledge who may be more benefited by the enjoyment of that which I am desirous to appropriate to myself than I can If so what right have I to prefer self gratification to superior utility'  Mine is a case in point  Again property is left for which he may be induced to contend and which should he do so will probably be dissipated in law If not it may with no less probability be decided by law to be mine He affirms that to contend at law is immoral  "Do you and he listen to what I have now to say  I am desirous of totally changing my conduct I have a heart more capable of affection than you Lydia have reason to suppose and I love you My ambition at present is to do you much more good than I have ever done you harm I am once more at my own disposal and unless that ardent love which you formerly bore me be entirely changed which I do not believe it is I am now sincerely desirous to make you my wife  But I will not deceive you I can only be such a husband as you desire on condition of being left in quiet possession of that which I believe to be my own I have ruined my character Offices of emolument are not easily obtained but if they were I am not a man to be trusted I will not live a beggar deprived of all the blessings in which the fools around me wallow till they turn them into curses I wish to live happily unmolesting and unmolested but if I must  either prey or be preyed upon I am still resolved rather to act the fox than the goose  I know you will condemn this determination but I am speaking openly and telling you what my intentions are without entering into their defence  Supposing Mr Trevor to be convinced that the law will decide the property contested in his favour the sacrifice demanded of him is perhaps too great to be expected from any man Yet from what I have heard and what I know this is the sacrifice that I do expect I expect it from his abhorrence of pretending to seek justice by the aid of law I expect it from that principle which decides in favour of the greatest good And I expect it from the earnest desire I have heard him express that you might be restored to that happiness which for a time you have lost  Should he or you conclude that the  motives I now urge originate in that artifice of which I have been very justly accused I ought perhaps to feel no surprise and shall certainly make no complaint But believe me or believe me not I have spoken with a sincerity of heart for which I am likely to gain but little credit Such I feel at this moment are the misfortunes to which cunning subjects itself I am a man but little subject to fear yet I own the fear of being thought still to possess nothing better than this cunning assaults me obliges me to omit the tender epithets that are in my thoughts and without addition to sign myself  F WAKEFIELD  While I read the eyes of Miss Wilmot were fixed upon my countenance Whenever I looked toward her I could perceive the strong emotions of hope and fear by which she was agitated  When I had ended I said"Mr Wakefield is indeed an extraordinary man Be his intentions honest or base the strength and clearness of his mind and his knowledge of the human heart when we recollect how these faculties have been employed are truly astonishing If this be a plan of artifice it is little less than miraculous Yet who can believe it to be any thing else"  Miss Wilmot heaved a deep sigh and attempted to speak but she only stammered Her utterance failed and her eyes were cast on the floor Hope and despair were combating and the latter was the strongest She wished to confide she wished to plead for the possibility of his being sincere but the mischief he had inflicted the deceit he had practised and a rememberance of the picture she had formerly given me of him rushed upon her mind and her spirits sunk  "Look up lovely Lydia" said I taking  her hand "and revive There is there must be hope The man who could write this letter cannot be all villain"  The struggle of the passions was violent A momentary wildness such as I had formerly witnessed flashed in her eyes she started from her seat griped my hand then bursting into tears exclaimed "Oh Mr Trevor" and dropped down again upon the chair  Eager to relieve a heart so overcharged I again addressed her "If" said I "the property left by Mr Wakefield's uncle can really be employed to so noble a purpose as that of reclaiming him and making you happy let me perish rather than endeavour to counteract such blessings Let me be the thing he so much dreads a beggar but let me obey the purest passions of the heart when they are sanctioned by the best principles of the understanding"  'Till this instant she had forgotten that  if I consented to enrich him I must rob myself But the thought no sooner occurred than she cried "No It must not be It cannot be To require it of you is infamous It debases him and would make me hate myself were I to participate in such an action"  "You judge too severely" I replied "I am not so unfortunately circumstanced as he is My character is not lost I am not shut out of society I have friends plans and prospects and granting him to be sincere his arguments as far as they relate to him and me are I suspect unanswerable Of that sincerity I would fain not doubt but it is our mutual duty to be wary Here therefore at present the matter shall rest I am determined to bring no action till time and future events shall teach me the course I ought to pursue"  Overwhelmed by a sense of obligation and by the thronging emotions of every  kind that assailed her she was again half suffocated with passion As she recovered her eyes sufficiently spoke her feelings  When she grew calm she was led to ask what conversation I had had and with whom relative to Mr Wakefield I gave her the history of my acquaintance with the supposed Belmont and of the scene that had passed that very day which she thought altogether surprising and seemed to shrink with the fear that it was an artful plan contrived by artful men She was in some sort appeased however when I once more reminded her of my determination to wait and hope for the best  I then enquired concerning the second letter she had mentioned To which she answered"It is addressed to me as a mediator but relates entirely to you and the person who wrote it your poor penitent servant Philip"  She gave it me and these were its contents  Honoured madam  I make bold to lay my case before you which as it is very grievous I hope it may move you to pity me I am the young man that lived with my honoured master Mr Trevor in the same house madam that you are pleased to live My name is Philip I have been guilty of a very great fault for which my conscience worries me night and day So that I am sure I shall never forgive myself though I take my holy saviour to witness it was more a mistake than a thought of committing so wicked a crime I was in a flurry so that I did not know what I was about for to think of having robbed a master that was so kind to me is such a sin and a shame as never was But I had no notion but that my poor dear master had drowned himself in the river and  so as he had told me the day before to make up my account and he would pay me the next morning I thought it was hard that I should lose my wages and the money beside which I had laid out for washing and newspapers and tea and sugar and other materials of that kind which though my wages  was  only eight pounds eight shillings made up the whole to twelve pounds five and threepence three farthings Which was the reason to make me do so base a thing as it would else have been as to break open the box and take out a ten pound note and four pair of stockings and two waistcoats because I knew very well my master's kindness so that it is ten to one if he had lived to make his will he would have given me them and more After which I hurried away being as I was told of a place with an old master that I was sure would take me again But I had no more thought that Mr Trevor  was living than the child unborn which since I discovered I have never been at rest being out of place and having nobody now to ask for a character which is the greatest misfortin that can behappen a poor servant that never was guilty of such an action as breaking open his master's box and running away with his money and things in all my life before or since So that I was tempted to list for a soldier but that I happened honoured madam to meet your maid Mary and she persuaded me to write to Mr Trevor which I durst not do though I know his goodness So she said your honoured ladyship would be so kind and tender hearted as to lay my case before Mr Trevor and my dear and honoured mistress Miss Mowbray both of  which  I would run to the world's end to serve On which she said she was sure they would take my case into merciful consideration  and grant me their gracious forgiveness  Which is the humble petition of your distressed servant to command honoured madam  PHILIP FRANKS  Poor fellow Forgive thee What is thy crime An inaccuracy A mistake of judgment A desire to do thyself right without intentional wrong to me or any one Yet for this mistake differently circumstanced thou mightest have lost thy life and have been hanged like a dog  I too accused thee of robbery of taking more than thy due when thou tookest less Hadst thou offered thy old waistcoats and stockings to a street hawker he would not have given thee half the surplus that was thy due  Such were the reflections that broke  from me after perusing his simple but affecting defence  Mary was called up and questioned She knew where he lived for the poor little inclined to suspicion confide in each other It is the rich only that tempt them to be treacherous  After consulting with Miss Wilmot it was determined that she should write to Olivia enclosing Philip's letter and requesting her to give him a character I knew she would take care to see him paid the wages that were his due and as I had been the cause of his want of employment since the fright he took at Cranfordbridge I left money to reimburse him for the loss of his time from that period  The people I mixed with and the prejudices of the world required that I should keep a servant but though the man that was with me was by no means so great a favourite as Philip had been I  did not think I had sufficient cause to discharge him for another There was an additional motive for not wishing Philip to be my servant again at least not under my present circumstances Olivia's aunt had imagined we were in league at Cranfordbridge and should she see him once more in my service that suspicion might either be revived or strengthened  CHAP III THE PERIOD OF CONTENTION APPROACHES AND THE UNABATED PATRIOTISM OF THE BARONET HECTOR AND THE EARL BECOME ENEMIES AND I AM MADE THE SUBJECT OF NEWSPAPER CALUMNY THREATENING APPEARANCES A JOURNEY PROJECTED A TRAGICAL EVENT GIVING OCCASION TO THE PRACTICE OF SOME SMALL PORTION OF HUMANITY  THE dissolution of parliament was hourly expected Flying reports fixed it to happen on different days but none  of them very distant The zeal of Sir Barnard in behalf of his country and its constitution was unabated The measures of ministry were wicked beyond example and the servility of parliament was unequalled since the time of the Tudors Such was the Baronet's continual theme  From him and the political circles I frequented I heard news in which I might be said to be personally concerned In consequence of the firm refusal of Olivia a rupture had taken place between Lord Idford and the family much at first to the regret of the Mowbrays till the turn that the quarrel took enflamed the latter  Hector Mowbray had great property and influence in the county of which he and I were both natives Of this county the Earl was the Lord Lieutenant and here he likewise had his dependents and partisans The Mowbrays were wealthy  and Hector was ambitious of being elected knight of the shire When it was first proposed the aunt forwarded the project for there was no probability that any other candidate so powerful should start The joint interest of the Earl and the Mowbrays would defy opposition  The Earl however understood traffic and finding himself so positively refused by Olivia he thought proper to inform the family that she must either be induced to consent or instead of aiding to bring Hector into parliament he should himself propose and support another candidate with the whole weight of his interest  The threat was galling It was insinuated first to the aunt and when Hector was informed of it he affected to vapour and treat it with defiance but on better consideration he and the aunt thought proper to importune Olivia hoping they should oblige her to comply  Threats and intreaties alike were vain Her resolution was not to be shaken and the Earl more openly declared that if she should think proper to persist he would beggar himself rather than Hector should carry his election  Hector had been canvassing the county had subscribed to races been present at the assizes given public dinners and taken various means to increase his popularity of which he had become inordinately vain Inflated therefore with a certainty of victory he threw down the gauntlet and dared the Earl to the field  In the mean time paragraphs appeared in a morning and an evening paper both of them sold to Government and the echoes of each other that were evidently aimed at me and my connections At first I could not have conceived how I should have attracted the attention of those worthy gentlemen who earn their bread by the daily manufactory of lampoons  but I was soon informed that this is become a regular branch of business and that the motives to carry it on are many These motives originate in paymasters of various descriptions of whom the treasury is supposed to be the chief  The libels of which I was the subject aimed to be satirical but were too dull of wing to hit their mark they were only malignant They could neither tickle the fancy nor gall the heart but they proved that I had lurking enemies who wished to wound did they but know when and where to strike  It was well known that my professedly dear friend Glibly was principally concerned in the morning paper where these libels generally appeared When I first became acquainted with him he affected indifference to parties and was ready to praise or laugh at either as circumstances should happen to direct him but when the temper of the times became  intolerant and acrimonious he thought it prudent to take a decided part That such a man should declare in favour of the weakest was not to be expected and he now associated with the known hirelings of ministry of whom I was a still more open and undisguised opponent  By these attacks on me Glibly therefore for they were undoubtedly a part of his handywork Glibly I say had a threefold motive He indulged a propensity which strange to say he had acquired of wounding in the dark that he might smile and shake hands with the insulted person in broad day he answered the end for which ministry retained him that of decrying all its antagonists and he particularly forwarded the views of another of his dear friends the Earl  The general complexion of paragraphs like these is falsehood which is sometimes direct though it is more commonly a perversion of existing facts The  pamphlet I had written which had been partially made known to the public by the advertisement that had appeared the patronage of Sir Barnard my ambitious views on the Mowbray family with such other particulars as the indefatigable Glibly could collect sometimes delivered in obscure allusions and at others more openly were the topics of calumny How many of these ingenious devices to irritate and injure were framed I never knew for I seldom read them myself though I heard of them sufficiently often to be assured that they were numerous  There were various means by which they might have been stopped and of which in ordinary cases bribing is chiefly practised but in this instance fighting or the law would have been more effectual Of these however I totally disapproved Defamation is an evil but death is generally and perhaps always a greater and to prevent enquiry is among the  worst of evils I was not yet sufficiently acquainted however with the mistakes to which men are subject or rather impelled by the institutions they admire not to feel great surprise and some indignation at the obstacles which I found were continually to impede my career He who has never travelled into the country of Mosquitoes is not aware how slight a network covering will preserve him from their sting  These were trifles and would have been unworthy of notice had they not resembled the small cloudy speck which though scarcely visible in the distant horizon approaches and swells and bursts over the head in a storm The beginning contest between the Earl and the Mowbray family the interest which the worthy Mr Glibly had thought proper to take in me and my affairs the patriotism of Sir Barnard nay the friendship of Mr Evelyn himself that best of men  were but so many links in the chain of that fate which was impending  At present however with respect to the Baronet I daily increased in favour He frequently requested me to accompany him when he went down to the house and paraded with me arm in arm through the avenues catching every man he knew by the button and introducing me then descanting on the news of the day the victories of the minister among his creatures and in the house and the defeats of his projects every where else  At length it was generally affirmed and believed that parliament would be dissolved in a fortnight and as Sir Barnard wished to keep well with his borough he proposed that we should go down and visit the worthy and independent electors among whom he observed we might spend a few days in a pleasant manner and advantageously to his interest  till the writ of election should be issued This was on the Wednesday but as there was to be a debate and probably a division of the house on Friday his sense of public duty would not permit him to be absent on such an occasion and we agreed to defer our journey till Saturday morning  During this short interval an incident occurred which it is necessary I should relate It happened on the Thursday that after spending the day near Richmond where I had been invited to dine I was returning home on horseback followed by my servant for I thought myself obliged to practise some part of that aristocracy which I nevertheless very sincerely condemned  The night was starlight and as we were cantering down a lane at the entrance of Barnes common we heard distant cries and the report of a pistol in the direction as we believed in which we  were proceeding I immediately stopped and listened very attentively but all was soon silent Being convinced as well by the cries as the firing of the pistol that a robbery if not something worse had been committed and not certainly knowing from what point the sound came I rode gently forward and continued to listen with the utmost attention desiring my servant to do the same  We rode on still walking our horses and looking cautiously round for some time without any sight or sound of man approaching us till we came to a gate at the edge of the common Here I saw a horse standing patiently without his rider and stopping once more to look and listen I presently perceived an indistinct object which I discovered to be a man wounded and weltering in his blood  I spoke to him but no answer was returned nor any sound I then raised the  body in my arms and it appeared to be lifeless  What was to be done A human being who might be dead or might not in either case must not be left in such a situation  The neighbourhood is populous and I could distinguish lights at no very great distance Fearing left if I sent my servant he should blunder or that the persons he might address himself to would be less likely to pay attention to him than to me I bade him remain by the dead or wounded man and mounting my horse I rode away immediately to procure aid  My direction was across the common and fortunately I met with a carriage which proved to be a hackney coach returning to town with two passengers I ordered the coachman to stop and he immediately supposed I was a highwayman but being undeceived he refused to go out of his way for the purpose I required  The persons within hearing a kind of squabble and understanding when they listened the nature of it spoke to me and enquired into the particulars By good luck they happened to feel properly and joined me against the coachman who though unwillingly was obliged to submit and when he came to the point where the roads join to turn back and receive the wounded man into the carriage The passengers alighted I ordered my man to take the horse of the stranger in charge and we proceeded slowly to the first inn  Here I immediately enquired for surgical and medical assistance and as the people of these villages are many of them opulent good practitioners were presently procured  While the messengers were dispatched I had leisure to examine the stranger whose appearance figure and countenance were altogether extremely interesting His hair was abundant but  milk white his features were serene and his form in despite of age was still manly The benevolence of his countenance was heightened by the blood with which his locks were in part clotted and that had streamed over his face upon his clothes and linen  The medical gentlemen arrived nearly at the same time the stranger was examined the pulsation of the heart was perceptible and though the contusions on the head and the temple were violent and he had been shot in the shoulder so that the ball had passed through behind they were of opinion as there was no fracture of the skull that the wounds were not mortal The appearance of the stranger and the condition in which I found him had made a lively impression upon me I was fearful of leaving him in an unknown place amidst the casualties and hurry of an inn to the care of waiters and the neglect of persons  who had scarcely leisure to be humane I therefore determined to send my servant to town and stay with him that night I had an appointment and other business in the morning but I could be at London in less than an hour that was therefore no obstacle  Hoping to have discovered his place of abode I desired his pockets to be searched before the people present but they were entirely emptied and contained no paper or memorandum that could afford information  After some time by the aid which was procured his pulse began to quicken and his lungs to do their office and that nothing might be omitted I prevailed on the physician to remain with me at his bedside and attend to every symptom above half the night With this he the more willingly complied because he was apprehensive of fever when the circulation should recover all its elasticity  In the morning though very unwillingly I was obliged to forsake my charge but not till I had lest money with the physician who made himself accountable to the innkeeper for all expences Being a humane person I believe he would have done this without my interference But in addition to that every mark about the stranger his look his dress and the horse on which he was mounted denoted him to be a gentleman and when I left him though the physician thought it was probable he might not recover the use of his understanding and the power of speech for a day or two he yet was persuaded that he would not die  CHAP IV AN INCIDENT IN THE PARK OR THE DANGER OF UNRULY DOGS AND HORSES THE FORTITUDE AND AFFECTION OF OLIVIA A VISIT TO THE WOUNDED STRANGER  KNOWING the habits of Sir Barnard to be precise and pettish so that if I counteracted the arrangement he had made it would put him into a disagreeable temper I resolved as we were to depart early the next morning to return as soon as possible to the stranger About two in the afternoon I was riding through the park for this purpose and here another incident occurred which though it excited extreme terror it afterward afforded uncommon delight  A few days before I had witnessed a lady on a runaway horse who was seized with fright dropped from the faddle and bruised herself exceedingly She would  have been in no danger if she had behaved but with the ordinary resolution of a man and the accident led me to reflect on the ill education to which women are subjected They seem to be esteemed by men in proportion as they are helpless timid and dependent It is supposed they cannot be affectionate unless their leading feature be imbecility  Just as I had crossed the bridge over the Serpentine river two ladies and a gentleman with their grooms all on horseback were turning round and went off in a hand gallop toward Kensington gardens I was riding fast at no great distance and perceived it to be Olivia her aunt and some person whom I did not know Olivia was mounted on a fine blood horse and a large dog rushed by him in pursuit of me being tempted by my fast galloping  The horse of Olivia had previously been put upon his mettle I saw the danger  and instantly pulled up but he began to plunge and kick in a manner that would have unhorsed most men The dog then turned from me and attacked the animal that was highest in motion and the horse immediately set off full speed The foolish servant being frightened began to gallop after her I was obliged to do the same and stop him for the clattering of feet behind did but increase the fury of the runaway horse  Terrified however as I was when I first noticed the vicious propensities of the horse the courage of Olivia was such her seat was so firm and she kept so steady a hold of the strong curb rein that I felt a confidence she would overpower the horse if the fear and folly of some other person should do no mischief I therefore followed at a proper distance and when I saw several horsemen who attempted to cross her I shouted and waved my hat for them to keep off  My hopes were justified She avoided every danger by her management and presence of mind and by her use of the curb and the aid of the wall at the end of the ride arrested the course of the intemperate animal  Having kept the grooms back I was the first that came up with her and leaping from my saddle I seized the reins and held them till the servant arrived I then enjoyed one more rapturous moment such as I had indeed but little foreseen I received her in my arms  Not a minute before how firm and collected had her mind and actions been but no sooner did she feel my embrace than her frame was suffused A thousand ideas that had no relation to the danger which her own fortitude had escaped immediately rushed upon her she sunk upon my shoulder and burst into a flood of tears They were the heart easings  of ten thousand of the foregone anxieties of love  How could I have hated the broad day and the prying eyes that were upon us How welcome would the fogs and darkness of Cranfordbridge have been My adventurous spirit would then have surely imprinted the first kiss of love as chaste as it would have been ecstatic  This bliss alas was not to be The crowd approached I pressed her hand and as an assurance of fidelity she gently returned the token of kindness Such mute signs being all that were permitted  Perceiving I must leave her I again requested she would not mount the unruly horse and she replied with a heavenly smile "Have no fear for me I will be careful of myself" to which she added in a low whisper "for my preserver's sake"  Oh moments of unutterable bliss  Who can estimate your worth One of you will outweigh a life such as the dull round of common place nothings can yield  Did not my eyes thank her Did not the strong workings of my colour and countenance inform her of what was passing within Oh yes And in the same language she involuntarily replied He who shall suppose there was one emotion which celestial purity might not approve cannot comprehend Olivia They were emanations such as those only who have souls as well as bodies are acquainted with  The tide of ecstacy must turn The aunt came up I bowed she returned my salute in a manner that shewed her mind was affected by contradictory emotions and I mounted my horse and guided his head toward the Park gate through which I passed feeling at the moment that I was passing the gate of paradise  I had not however left all my heaven behind me No I bore with me ample stores for delicious revery The fortitude of Olivia the firm and easy grace with which she kept her seat her admirable management and quick presence of mind her unabating courage at one moment and her melting tenderness at the next were not the food but the feast of love  In this revelry of the imagination I indulged till I arrived at the inn where I found the physician agreeable to appointment and was informed by him that the stranger still continued insensible but that the symptoms appeared to be rather more than less favourable  I remained with the patient during some hours till the necessary preparation for my journey obliged me to depart I then left a sufficient sum with the physician and after most earnestly recommending the stranger to his care reluctantly returned to town  Though I had obtained a promise from the physician that the patient should be removed to his own home as soon as it should be discovered or to the house of the physician whenever it might be done without danger I yet could not help questioning whether to leave him to the mercy of persons with whom I was unacquainted that I might take a journey to visit the free and independent electors of an English borough were faithfully to fulfill the duties of humanity Add to which the venerable and benevolent appearance of the stranger was so uncommonly interesting that it made a strong impression upon my imagination  But it was necessary to decide and I acted as mortals are obliged to do on such occasions not knowing what was best I adopted that which appeared to be the most urgent  CHAP V THE JOURNEY TO THE BOROUGH OF THE BARONET INDEPENDENT ELECTORS AND THEIR MOTIVES SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED EVIL COMMUNICATION CORRUPTS GOOD MANNERS ELECTORS EAGER TO MAKE HAY WHILE THE SUN SHINES AND BEING ONCE BOUGHT WISH AGAIN TO BE BRIBED  THE following morning at the hour appointed Sir Barnard and I set off for the borough of * * * * at which we arrived without delay or accident  The number of voters was little more than thirty and the first business after our arrival was to invite them to a dinner  It has long been remarked that men in a body will be guilty of actions of which individually they would each be ashamed In an assembly however the purpose of which is conscious iniquity few who have not witnessed such scenes  will be aware of the efforts that each man will make to argue himself into a belief of his own upright intentions or of the eager assent with which his endeavours will be seconded by his associates  In the present instance for example what were the motives of the worthy electors Sir Barnard explained them to the perfect satisfaction of all parties  But what were they The love of the constitution the honest struggles that honest men were making to displace a corrupt minister their very eager and laudable attempts to free an oppressed and ruined country relieve it of its taxes recover its trade and revive the glory of old England to effect these great and good purposes was the whole and sole end at which they aimed Were all the electors through all the boroughs cities and counties of Great Britain but as virtuous  as those of the borough of * * * * it would indeed be a happy land  Yet strange to say what different masks does selfassuming virtue wear State the per contra Imagine only how many free and independent electors were at this period exulting in a similar manner at the purity of their own conduct while giving their votes for the support of government the maintenance of order and to preserve the immaculate statesman the saviour of the nation the great financier the first of orators the admiration of Europe and the wonder of the world in power  Who will deny that a general election is the season when all the disinterested virtues all the pure patriotism all the most generous and best qualities of the soul are called into action How are the morals of the people improved To what a height of grandeur does human  nature rise and how captivating is the point of view in which it is seen Aera of incomprehensible excellence  Can it be supposed that I who was to be the representative of such free and noble souls through whose lips their patriotic spirits were to breathe I in whom one five hundredth part of the virtue of the whole island was to be compressed and bottled up ready for use being as I was in company with sages whose office it was to choose one still more sage than themselves thus circumstanced was it possible that I should not imbibe some portion of their sublime wisdom Had I no sympathy Were all my affections and passions and patriotism extinct  Oh no Mocking says the proverb is catching and however in my sober moments among sober people reasoning on objects at a distance I might systematise and legislate for the conduct of myself and others being an actor in the  scene whether its atmosphere were healthy or contagious I never yet found that I could wholly escape imbibing a part of the effluvia I gave toasts made speeches sung songs ay and wrote them too and became so incorporated with my constituents lovers as they were of liberty that the cut of our cloaths and countenances excepted I might in this moment of overflowing sapience have been taken for one of themselves  I was little aware however when I consented to make this journey of its consequences Disinterested as these worthy voters were and purchased by wholesale as they had been when the family of the Brays bought the borough they yet had wives and daughters who wore watches and rings and gowns and who would each of them think themselves so flattered by a genteel present from me that there was no describing the pleasure it would give them  Every  particular  about me told them I was very much of a gentleman  Beside which one lady had a great affection for a few pounds of the best green tea bought in London Another discovered that the loaf sugar in the country was abominable A third could not but think that a few jars of India pickles and preserved ginger would be a very pretty present It would always remind her of the giver A fourth could not but say she  did  long for a complete suit of lace cap handkerchief and ruffles and so on through the whole list  The men too were troubled with their longings With one it was London porter with another it was Cheshire cheese and bottled beer They would both drink to the donor Their neighbour longed very vehemently indeed for the horse I rode and finding that the animal was too great a favourite to be parted with  he compounded for twelve dozen of old port  When these hints which looked very like demands were first given me I applied to Sir Barnard doubting much whether any of them ought to be complied with but he let me understand that such things were politic and customary and that a seat in parliament even when bestowed was not to be had free of expence  What could be done To have required him to pay these disbursements would have had so much the appearance of meanness that it was what I could not propose To request a loan in advance of Mr Evelyn was sufficiently grating to the feelings but he had a liberal spirit it was the least painful of the two and I had no other resource Fortune was whetting the darts she soon intended to hurl  CHAP VI NEWS FROM MOWBRAY PETITIONING FOR AID THE PERIOD OF UNIVERSAL UPROAR ARRIVES AND THE BARONET PURSUES HIS PATRIOTIC PURPOSES A FEW SKETCHES OF A COUNTY CONTEST AT A GENERAL ELECTION HECTOR LOVING IN HIS LIQUOR QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE WHICH ARE THOUGHT VERY UNSEASONABLE AND VERY RIDICULOUS THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE DEFECTION OF SIR BARNARD AND THE SUSPICION THAT LIGHTS ON ME  WHILE we were spending our time in this "pleasant manner and advantageously to the Baronet's interest" we received intelligence of our quondam friends the Earl and young Mowbray who were canvassing the county in which they had vowed opposition to each other with indefatigable zeal so that a ruinous contest probably to both parties was predicted  In this county Sir Barnard himself had some interest for he had some lands  there and Hector prevailed on a common friend to write in a very urgent style to the Baronet requesting his aid How could so great a lover of his country as Sir Barnard indignant too as he felt himself at the apostacy of the Earl refuse a request by which his own patriotic purposes might be forwarded  At length parliament was dissolved and the whole kingdom was immediately in a tumult Driving rioting and uproar began God help the poor posthorses hostlers and chambermaids  The writ for the Baronet's borough was made out his agents were ready and as there could be no opposition our business was soon over It was high time for my pocket was tolerably drained And as the worthy electors very industriously compared notes when any one of them discovered that the present made to his neighbour was of greater value than the  compliment  which he had received I had  immediate intimation of my own injustice which it was expected I should correct  This serious business settled and these accounts closed the Baronet now had leisure to think of his friends and he turned his thoughts to the annoying of Lord Idford He had purchased me as well as his borough for he had made me his own member and meant to profit by me in all possible ways He had discovered my electioneering talents I was very engaging among the women a matter of no small moment in such affairs and "though I was rather shy of my glass yet I could sing an excellent song which I could likewise make quite suitable to the occasion" He therefore proposed that we should both journey into my native county and there exercise all our wit and ingenuity to aid in bringing in my old schoolfellow Hector  It cannot be supposed that in an affair  where the family and the brother of Olivia were so seriously implicated I could be totally unconcerned With respect to the question of who was the most virtuous or the most wife who the greatest orator the best patriot or the properest person to take a seat among the grand national council of sages the Earl or the 'Squire that was not easily determined It was a point therefore that did not disquiet my conscience My compliance was consequently given with a hearty good will and we both prepared for the holy work  How it happened that the vice which inevitably attaches itself to such conduct selfevident gross and glaring as it is fatal to private morals and public virtue odious in its practice and hellish in its consequences how the baneful complexion of this monster vice should at first so totally escape me is more than I can declare Hurry of thought confusion  of intellect and eagerness of passion are the only probable conjectures I can make My mind was so intent on the manner in which I could best prove my respect for Olivia and all that related to her that this appears to have been a gulph vast enough for all recollection sense and idea  A postchaise and four soon brought us to the field of battle and then I own my blood began to circulate and my feelings to awaken Still it was but gradually that my spirits mounted to the proper tone  Before we entered the place where the election was to be held we heard the jangling of bells and the shouts of men The postillions spared neither whip nor spur and as we galloped furiously along the streets the people came swarming out the women and children saluting us with their shrill trebles and it being dark the men crowding to follow  with torches and more sonorous hubbub Every inn was a scene of confusion When we drove up to that which was the headquarters of Hector his partisans immediately flocked round us and a courier having previously announced our arrival saluted Sir Barnard with all the force of lungs they could heave elated in proportion to the uproar they made  The 'Squire and his friends vociferous though they were and heated with anticipated triumphs wine and wassail heard the glorious din learned its cause and came reeling forth to embrace their puissant ally Quitting as they did the fumes of buttocks and sirloins gammons and hams turkies and geese wines brandies beers and tobacco they all came reeking each involved in his own atmosphere  Their joy was boisterous and not to be repulsed Hector was as drunk as the animal that brought the royal David his  sucking pigs and as loving as the monster in the Tempest He could not indeed curse so poetically but what he wanted in variety he supplied by repetition and his oaths and his raptures were countless  He bestowed a part of them upon me for not only did feasting make him fond but he had just memory enough left to recollect that I was now become an M P and he was not quite sure whether till he had gained his election I might not at present be almost as great a man as himself I was moreover his electioneering friend which virtue would for a fortnight to come be inestimable  I had been disgusted with the eating and drinking required at the readybought borough of **** but that was abstinence itself compared to the scene in which I had consented to become an actor Away the Baronet and I were dragged  by the most jovial crew Hector our leader and seating himself in state at our head  "Clean glasses" bellowed the hero and seizing his own smashed it against the wall commanding us to follow his noble example Midway drunkenness disdains to think all arms were raised and destruction was impending Fortunately there were two sober men in company and seeing what had happened we both loudly called"Forbear" "You have cut one of the waiters" added I addressing myself to Hector and pointing to a man whose face was smeared with blood "Damn him" retorted the brave Hector "Put him down in the bill" The mighty man was pleased at his own secondhand wit and as an old joke is the soonest understood they all joined in the laugh  Eager to make the new comers welcome that is as drunk as himself Hector  insisted that the Baronet and I should drink three bumpers each and as the fatigue of travelling had rendered this no difficult task we complied  He then swore we would  set to  for the night but I perceived that his night would not be a long one Toasts were called for however and liquor was swallowed till its vapours half deprived the redoubted Hector of the faculty of speech At this period he began to mutter nonsense on a subject on which I should have been better pleased with his silence than his praise He made the lovely Olivia his theme and in the fulness not of his heart but of his stomach told me how dearly she loved me"Yes my boy she does by G And she's right Damn me she's right I say it by G my boy she's right You are my friendYou are my friend and she's right And as for Lord kissdamn me he's a sneaking scoundrel I say it  a sneaking So she's right Damn me she's right"  He continued to repeat his oaths and "She's right" till entirely overpowered be sunk and would have dropped from his chair if the waiter whom he had cut with the glass had not caught him Some of the guests had withdrawn some were sleeping and some were senseless but the few who could open their eyes and see to such a distance triumphed in the defeat of their leader which they considered as victory to themselves  Riot now paused per force The Baronet pleaded fatigue and retired I followed his example and once more found myself alone left to ruminate on the methods which men take to make each other happy on their different modes of happiness in their different stations and on waiters who being maimed or killed are to be charged in the bill  Though these thoughts were not of the most delightful kind they did not prevent me from sleeping The new day brought new cares and presented projects in which I was required to take my part that led me to very serious meditations indeed The poll was to begin that day week and Hector and his friends roused from the torpor of overloaded revelry by the importance of the business assembled to consider how they should best collect and marshal the voters of whom they supposed themselves to be certain and cajole and bring over such as they imagined might be gained  Of this labour each man was to take his allotted share and direct bribery was openly proposed as the general medium by which the great end in question was to be promoted  This was what I had not foreseen I was not only young but as I have before remarked I had thought but little on the  affair except as it continually presented the image of Olivia to my mind I now found myself most painfully situated I had discovered principles of human conduct in which I had gloried I had asserted them unsparingly and had promised myself that from them I would never depart In doubtful cases I might decide and act erroneously but when the way was clear my conduct should be the same  These principles I was required to abandon and the shock was severe The transactions which had lately passed in the Baronet's borough increased the difficulty In what light could the presents that I had made be considered In what were they different from and how much better than bribes To these I had submitted when my own interest was in question Again for what purpose had I consented to accompany Sir Barnard if not to exert myself in favour  of his friend And not only his friend but the brother of Olivia though this was a silent grief known only to myself However I stated my scruples which as soon as they were heard were the subject of laughter I repeated them in a still more serious tone and was reminded of the facts and motives which I have just been mentioning  The struggle was violent The arguments I had to urge were something like insults on every body present that heard me and I was answered sometimes with ridicule at others with anger and not unfrequently with something very like contempt  The Baronet in particular augured very unfavourably concerning the subserviency which he expected from me and once or twice spoke in a very dictatorial tone but finding himself answered with no little indignation he had no remedy but to chew the cud in silence  Assailed on all sides as it happened I had the good sense in despite of every mockery and insinuation to remain firm and the only part I could be prevailed upon to take determinately was that of aiding in a fair and open canvas leaving those who were less conscientious to distribute bribes As it was imagined however that I possessed some abilities my services were accepted on my own conditions  Meanwhile the waste that was committed the bribes that were paid and the money that was squandered in every way as well in London where voters were eagerly purchased and sent down by coach loads as in distant parts of the county and kingdom convinced me that the sums which this election would cost must be enormous I even thought it my duty to take an opportunity in one of Hector's half sober moments to remonstrate with all the arguments and  energy I could collect and endeavoured to persuade him to decline the poll But my efforts were useless He was equally vain of his wealth and his influence His purse perhaps was as deep as that of the proud peer his friends as numerous and he would carry his election though he were to mortgage every foot of land he possessed  Finding him resolved I became anxious in his behalf strained every nerve rode in all directions night and day and so effectually exerted myself in enquiring who were the independent men likely to be influenced by honest motives that I procured him above fifty votes  With respect to himself the continual drinking vociferating and riot of the scene had made him so hoarse that previous to the day of election his husky whispers were not audible  The evening before the poll opened an incident occurred for which at that  time I knew not how to account It was no less amazing than incomprehensible I had returned very much fatigued after hard riding and found a message had been left for me by Sir Barnard who desired to speak with me immediately  I obeyed the summons and found him alone He opened the conversation in a strange blustering tone complaining of having been neglected or insulted he did not seem to know which and to my astonishment declared his satisfaction at the scruples which I had professed He knew not what to say to such corrupt proceedings Perhaps an honest man ought to have no concern in them and for his own part he certainly should trouble himself no farther on the present occasion He had met with but little thanks for what he had already done and he had come to a resolution not to bring up his voters  Acquainted with the corrupt arts by which the promises of these voters generally speaking had been gained I knew not what to reply though I felt no little chagrin With the aid of Sir Barnard it was supposed that Mowbray's election would certainly have been carried but without that aid I was persuaded it would as certainly be lost  This opinion I forcibly repeated adding that though elections like these were destructive beyond description to the general happiness and though I could not defend having taken any part whatever in one of them yet the mischief in the present instance had already been done If Sir Barnard had received any insult or even suffered any neglect I intreated that he would permit me to be the mediator and state his griefs being persuaded from all I had seen that nothing injurious to his person or his interest had been intended  His answers were evasive He acted as men frequently do who have some secret purpose which they dare not avow he affected that waspish irritation of temper to which he was subject so many occasions but on none so frequently as when he suspected himself to be wrong  While we were in the heat of this discourse a chaise and four drove up to the door It was for the Baronet His trunk and mine were both prepared by his orders The men were buckling the former behind the carriage and he requested me to accompany him to town  I was thunderstruck I could neither account for such sullen intemperance nor the secrecy of this haste I again urgently intreated I might acquaint Mr Mowbray and his committee but he peremptorily refused and repeated his desire that I would accompany him immediately No arguments no prayers could move him so that at last I hastily left  the room in search of Hector and his friends  He guessed my intention and as soon as I was gone stepped into the chaise and ordered the boys to drive away full speed leaving me behind to act as I should think proper but with a message that if I wished to oblige him I must mount my horse and ride after him with all expedition I might overtake him at the next inn and our servants and horses would then follow at leisure  It was some time before I could find Mowbray or any of his party They were at another inn promoting the good cause and when I informed them of the intentions of Sir Barnard they scarcely could believe me but when they heard the chaise was at the door they hurried with me full of anxiety and dismay We were too late Sir Barnard was gone long out of hearing and out of sight  The consternation was extreme Stupefied as his faculties were for a moment Hector was roused Conjectures were formed but none presented themselves that could account for such extraordinary conduct No one knew of any offence that had been given the Baronet It was remarked indeed on recollection that the last day or two he had not testified the same alacrity and zeal but no man could guess his motive  At length the indignation of Hector took vent in a volley of curses which were plentifully and emphatically bestowed And so keenly was the stroke felt that he put a very unusual quantity small though it was of variety in his oaths Not only the body and blood of Sir Barnard but his liver eyes and heart were consigned over to Satan  Even I though I had procured votes distinct from the interest of the Baronet and had refused to follow him to town  in which refusal I persisted still I did not escape suspicion No direct allegation was made but the questions that were put to me were sufficiently expressive of doubt  The irritated mind is apt at error and I disdained to make a personal application of the guilt by which I knew myself uncontaminated  CHAP VII THE OPENING OF THE POLL MY FIRST ESSAY AT PUBLIC ORATORY THE GENERAL FEELINGS OF MEN IN FAVOUR OF VIRTUE THOUGH CONTRADICTED BY THEIR PRACTICE THE HATEFUL SPECTACLE OF A CORRUPT ELECTION AND MORE CAUSE OF COMPLAINT AGAINST THE BARONET A FALSE ACCUSATION RESENTED  PASSION dispels passion and care combats care Sir Barnard was gone diligence was the more necessary and preparations  for the approaching day would not admit of neglect It may well be said that circumstances and situation make the man Hector who had no habitual capacity for business or intellect for order was inspired by the occasion with a degree of talent of which at other times he was incapable The fatigue he underwent was excessive and impossible as it was that he should create any strong sympathy I still felt some interest in his behalf and some alarm at the fixed hoarseness by which his lungs were threatened and the alteration which incessant drinking and unusual efforts had produced in his appearance  The night was passed with more than ordinary tumult It was late before the riotous guests departed and our rest was short The day of beginning contest soon broke upon us the word of command was given to muster and all was in action The friends of the opposing  parties collected each round their respective leaders favours for the hat and bosom were lavishly distributed the flags were flying a band of music preceded each of the processions and when the parties approached the hustings each band continued to play its own favourite air with increasing violence as if war were to be declared by the most jarring discord and harmony driven from the haunts of men  The grating sounds were increased by ballad singers marrowbones and cleavers and the vociferous throats of men who seemed to imagine that if they were but sufficiently noisy they could not fail of being victorious  The scaffolding was mounted the candidates appeared and mouths ears and eyes were open for the reception of all the wisdom and patriotism with all the  comicality  and  fun  which the orators were expected to bestow A mob delights in  being harangued and is thrown into raptures by every kind of mountebank  Jealous perhaps of his own honor the god of eloquence decreed that neither the wit nor the wisdom of Hector should that day be heard He was too hoarse for any effort to make him audible but as stirring and ambitious spirits on such occasions are always abroad tongues were not wanting to trumpet forth his high deserts  The candidates for oratorical fame were several I was of the number and as the gloss of my newly acquired dignity dazzled other eyes as well as my own I was permitted to take the lead It was my first essay and I felt a momentary alarm but full of youthful spirits and high in blood I dashed forward and uttered what first occurred  My voice was powerful my nonsense was applauded my fears vanished and I became more collected The real grievances  of mankind under the best government that ever yet existed have at all times been so numerous that an orator who makes them his theme is never in want of facts and arguments  Could I then feel this deficiency at an epocha like the one in question when means so despotic were daily adopted to curb the growing spirit of enquiry that despot ministers might pursue measures so tragical so subversive of the order which they pretended to maintain and so destructive to the happiness they were appointed to guard Alas the topics were so numerous so melancholy so almost maddening that the man who would paint them truly must temper and reinin his feelings with an iron arm otherwise imagination will so hurry him away that while describing evils past evils present and evils impending there is danger of his being deemed an incendiary  I spoke ill When I remembered what  I had said and what I might and ought to have said I was indignant at my own want of recollection The applause that I received nevertheless was prodigious the acclamations of the mob were even awful They displayed a feeling of justice so acute so prompt and so powerful that I was borne out of myself and imagined for a moment not merely that the day of reform was at hand but that it was come  Men are rendered selfish and corrupt by the baneful influence of the systems under which they live but it is well worthy the attention of those who believe mankind to be generally capable of great happiness and who are desirous to promote it that however the wants of the wretched may tempt them to accept the immediate relief that is within their reach they never collectively fail to bestow the most unbounded applause on those principles by which their own proceedings  are condemned They are not in love with baseness it is forced upon them  The reader is doubtless aware that Hector and his friends assumed to themselves the merit of what is called the independent interest and that his opponent was supported by the whole influence of the court party The numerous groans and hisses and the few plaudits bestowed upon the orators of this party were additional proofs of what is the general sense of mankind and that on the subject of corrupt influence at least they judge rightly In this general sense I own that my soul triumphed and the pangs which I felt after the poll began to perceive that whatever men might think they could forget their duty and vote only as their interest directed were undescribable  However the party of Hector was strong The struggle was violent Every scandalous art of election was resorted to  by both sides A spirit of rancour daily and hourly increased The opponents came to frequent blows Beastly drunkenness bloated insolence and profligacy of principle met the eye on every side and I almost hated myself not only for being present at and participating in it but to find that I belonged to a race of animals capable of such foul and detestable vice  From this distress I was relieved by an event which in itself was very far from satisfactory The poll had proceeded for some days with tolerable equality and Hector had rather the advantage though the voters in the interest of Sir Barnard had not given him their assistance to which they had frequently been urged At length they appeared And how great was the surprise and indignation of our whole party to see them marshalled on the opposite side with the favours of the Idford candidate in their hats  and uniformly come up and poll against us  On the same day twelve of the votes which had been promised to me were likewise brought over to the opposite interest and ten more of them refused to poll for either party  The coincidence of this desertion revived the suspicions of Hector and his party concerning me This sudden turn of the poll against him rendered his temper ungovernable and in the frenzy of passion he made no scruple of openly affirming that I was no less guilty than the Baronet  It was not merely the consciousness of innocence that I felt I had been so indefatigable in every possible way I had ridden and walked and talked I had been his defender his eulogist his orator his slave and had as it were so fouled my conscience in his cause that indignation closed my lips I disdained reply  or self vindication and casting a glance such as irresistible feeling dictated left the committee room in which the accusation was made without answering a word  CHAP VIII THE RETURN TO TOWN A VISIT TO SIR BERNARD ADMISSION DENIED ENQUIRIES AFTER THE WOUNDED STRANGER WHO HAD DISAPPEARED AN ENDEAVOUR TO GUARD AGAINST MISREPRESENTATION THE FEARS AND FEELINGS OF FRIENDS  MY determination was taken my servant was called my horses ordered and I immediately departed for London My thoughts were far from being clear or of a pleasant kind The scene I had left was the most odious that I had ever beheld Hector I was convinced would lose his election and what was more valuable his health I saw prognostics  which I thought could not be mistaken and which afterward proved as baleful as I then imagined them to be Whether the contest might not ruin the family was more than I knew and what the effect might be on Olivia and even on our hoped for union I could not foresee  The enigmatical conduct of Sir Barnard was no less perplexing His sudden desertion of Hector and of the cause which he had so loudly defended were alarming For what other interpretation could be put upon the voters in the Baronet's interest who not only refused to poll according to their promise but were all of them brought up in support of the Idford candidate Yet I was loth to conclude that an event so fatal to all my hopes as well to my private affections as to my public duties had taken place  My horses were excellent and carried us seventy miles in less time than it would  have taken to go post I intended to have ordered a chaise for the remainder of the way but a mail coach was to pass in half an hour and I waited There happened to be a vacancy in which I seated myself and by these means I arrived in town early in the morning  As soon as the day was far enough advanced my first care was to visit Sir Barnard and I own I approached the street and the house with a foreboding heart What had happened could not be unintentional It was too decided too abrupt and had too many marks of unprincipled treachery I knocked made my enquiries and was informed the Baronet was not at home I asked for Lady Bray and not at home was again the answer  As this was what I apprehended it excited but little surprise though much vexation However I left my card and departed more full of meditation even  than I came Not at home I had no doubt signified that my visits were no longer welcome  Still it was necessary I should know the truth and as I had been too intimate with the family to be ignorant of the haunts of Sir Barnard I went to the Cocoa tree a place to which he daily resorted and there lounged away between two and three hours over the papers hoping he would come  I was again disappointed The Baronet did not make his appearance and I began to conjecture that perhaps the servant had told me truly he might be out early on business or I knew not what  As it was past his hour at the Cocoa tree perhaps I should now find him at home I therefore went back and again made my enquiries and again received the same dry laconic answer It had an ill face but I had no immediate remedy  My next most pressing object of attention was the wounded stranger whom I had left under the care of the physician and whom I immediately determined to enquire after not without some silent reproaches to myself for having so long been absent on schemes such as those in which I had been concerned to the neglect of perhaps a more serious duty For duty seemed to require that men should rather abstain from elections such as they are at present than become aiders and abettors of them  My horses not being arrived and disliking the vehicle of a hackney coach I walked forward to the inn at which the stranger had been left musing much on the prospect before me which was once more beginning to be heavily overcast  Being come to my journey's end I found the stranger had been removed two days after I left him to London but the people of the inn could give me  no farther intelligence concerning him or the place of his residence  I then asked them to direct me to the house of the physician which they did but told me that he had left the kingdom  Determined however to make every possible enquiry I went to the house where I found only a person who was left in charge of the premises and who knew nothing more than that the physician was gone with a patient to Lisbon  These little incidents trifling as they appeared afforded me an excellent proof of the absurdity of false modesty which induces men from the egoistical fear of being thought vain to conceal or disguise the truth The physician had bestowed high eulogiums on my humanity after which he had hinted a desire but with wellbred reserve to know who I was and I catching the apparent delicacy of his feelings and thinking but  very little on the subject imagined there would be ostentation in personally taking to myself his praises by giving him my name and place of abode I therefore told him I would answer that question when we became better acquainted if he should then find he had no reason to alter his good opinion of me  Thus do men by affecting not to be vain indulge a kind of double refined vanity and lead themselves and others into error  Being disappointed in all my enquiries of this day my next care was to see Miss Wilmot Surrounded as I was by persons who thought me inimical to them and therefore were probably my inveterate enemies I knew not what false reports might be spread nor how to guard against them in the public opinion But I had one consolation Olivia had declared she was resolved to enquire before she again gave the least credit to calumny  It was therefore essentially necessary that I should acquaint Miss Wilmot with all that had passed  It was now evening and when I came to her lodgings I found her brother and Turl both there Though my absence had been short the meeting gave me no little pleasure It would likewise save me the trouble of a thrice told tale for to friends like these my heart was always open and I had something like an abhorrence of concealment and secret transactions I wished them to share in all my joys and as to my griefs they not only excited their sympathy but produced remarks and counsel by which they had often been cured  I told my story and it may well be imagined my hearers were neither inattentive nor unmoved The selfishness and depravity into which men are driven and the vices of which being thus impelled they are capable exemplified as  these vices were in my narration drew heavy sighs from the gentle and kind hearted Lydia made her much oppressed brother groan in spirit and excited in Turl those comprehensive powers that trace the history of facts through a long succession and teach by miseries that are past how miseries in future are to be avoided  The general feeling however was that danger was hovering over me The indignation of Wilmot at the treatment of men who most endeavoured to deserve well of their age and country was very strong  Neither was Turl less moved His manner was placid yet his feelings were acute But though they might vibrate for a moment toward discord they touched the true harmony at last He who has fixed principles of action is soon called to a recollection of his duties and the manner in which he ought to act  Roused by his friendship for me I should rather say by his affection he collected his faculties and presented to the imagination so sublime a picture of fortitude and of the virtue of enduring injuries and oppression with dignity that he prepared my mind most admirably for the trials that were to succeed  CHAP IX A SECOND AND MORE SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE BARONET AN ENIGMATICAL DIALOGUE THE MEANING OF WHICH HOWEVER MAY BE GUESSED  IT was not only the wish of my heart but it was quite necessary for me to see Mr Evelyn However it was exceedingly desirable that I should previously meet the Baronet left in what I should say my surmises might be false and I might produce a family disagreement between  persons who would both have conferred essential benefits on me if the supposed defection of Sir Barnard should not be true I determined therefore once more to go to the Cocoa tree and wait  As it happened waiting was not necessary The Baronet was there and though there was something of coldness in his manner it was by no means what my fears had taught me to expect Salutation having passed I requested to speak with him We retired into a private room and he began by telling me he was glad to see me again in town and no longer continuing to support a person whom he no longer esteemed his friend  At hearing this remark and the significance with which it was delivered my evil augury returned upon me in full force I answered that I had quitted Mr Mowbray not because I had deserted his  interest but because I had been unjustly accused  "Accused of what Mr Trevor"  "Of having been influenced by you to betray a party which I had pretended to espouse"  "And were you not influenced by me Mr Trevor"  "I never can be influenced by any man Sir Barnard to commit an action which my heart condemns"  "Do you mean Mr Trevor that your heart condemns me"  "The question is very direct and I am not desirous of wounding your feelings Sir Barnard but I must not be guilty of falsehood I certainly wish you had acted otherwise"  "Then you pretend to set up for yourself Mr Trevor and to have no deference whatever for me and my opinions"  "Personally as a gentleman who  meant to do me service I wish to preserve every respect for you Sir Barnard But I hope you do not expect of me any deference that should on any occasion whatever induce me to abandon either my public or my private duties"  "Very well Mr Trevor Very well I dare say you are so perfectly acquainted with your duties that no man on earth not even he who had been your greatest friend could induce you to alter any of your notions"  "I should hope Sir Barnard that either friend or enemy might so induce me provided he had truth and reason on his side"  "Very well Mr Trevor All that is very fine I dare say you understand your own interest and will take your own road even though you might if you pleased travel more at your case and in better company by going another way"  "Will you be kind enough to explain yourself Sir Barnard"  "No Mr Trevor I shall give no explanations till I am sure I am talking to my friend my fast friend Mr Trevor that will think and act with me If you will give me your word and honor as a gentleman to that why then we will talk together"  "If by thinking and acting together Sir Barnard you mean that you expect I should blindly and implicitly conform to any tergiversationI mean to any change"  "You need explain yourself no farther Mr Trevor I very well understand your meaning My friend is my friend Mr Trevor and he is no other man's friend Mr Trevor I could not but suppose you understood all that perfectly at first and I am very sorry to be so much deceived But it is my misfortune  to be always deceived and entrapped and"  "Entrapped Sir Barnard I hope you do not apply that word to me"  "Nay nay Mr Trevor I want no quarrelling"  "Nor do I Sir Barnard But if you suppose me capable of taking any advantage of what you may now think an illplaced confidence in me you egregiously mistake both my intentions and my character"  "I hope I do Mr Trevor You have a great fluency but I hope I do"  I saw him preparing to go and being exceedingly anxious to have a determinate answer I added"Let me intreat you Sir Barnard to give me an explicit declaration of what you expect from me"  "You must excuse me Mr Trevor I shall say no more at present You say I mistake your intentions I hope I do  Time will tell When you are my friend I shall be very glad to see you and so will Lady Bray Good morning to you Mr Trevor"  CHAP X REFLECTIONS ON THE MUTABILITY OF FORTUNE ON MONEY EXPENDED AND ON THE DUTIES OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP A STRANGE INCIDENT SHEWING THE PROPENSITY OF MAN TO SUPERSTITIOUS TERRORS A LAMENTABLE AND UNEXPECTED EVENT  WELL might I forebode the approach of evil and except that complaint is of no avail is waste of time is unhappiness and therefore is immoral well might I complain of those sudden strokes of fate by which whenever my prospects began to be flattering they were suddenly obscured in darkness and despair But if I had not supposed myself marked in an  extraordinary manner as the child of fortune to whose smiles and frowns I seemed to be capriciously subjected I know not what should have induced me to have written my history or rather the history of my youth for of what is yet reserved for me I am still ignorant  Not that I pretend to consider the hypocrisy selfishness and profligacy of titled folly and church pride as things in themselves extraordinary It was the coincidence and the number and manner of them by which in the crisis of my fate I seemed to be so repeatedly and so peculiarly affected that occasioned surprise and pain  Yet what was all that I had hitherto felt from persons like these when I remember that which I was now immediately doomed to feel The perverted and the vicious it is true can excite emotion and excite it strongly But how comparatively feeble does their utmost  malice seem as far as it affects only ourselves when brought in competition with the thunderbolt that strikes the virtuous that shuts the gate of hope and that robs us of those unspeakable pleasures which imagination has fondly stored as a grand resource against evil fall when and how it may  Parting from the Baronet expecting what was almost certain some change of political sentiment no matter how brought about by which my flattering expectations were at once to be rooted up my thoughts inevitably flowed into that train which was bitterness little short of anguish Mr Evelyn was a man of such peculiar virtue and disinterested benevolence of a heart so generous and so little capable of accusing me in consequence of the baseness of others that to have suspected him of such a mistake would have been the height of injustice But I could not forget the sums that he  had advanced in all four hundred pounds the more than probable failure of all the plans for which they had been advanced and the incapacity I had and should have to repay these sums  Neither could I forbear to take a restrospective view of the manner in which they had been expended Could I approve of that manner Could I forget how short a time it was though I had squandered my own money since I had forfeited no atom of my independence by accepting the earnings of others Suppose this parliamentary plan to fail and fail it must for there were no hopes that I could honestly retain my seat to what other means could I resort While I continued to indulge in wild and extravagant schemes of enriching myself by which I did but impoverish others ought I to require of Olivia to partake of my folly and its consequences Had I nothing but the cup of wretchedness to  offer and must I still urge her to drink Was it not my duty rather to tear myself at once away from her and place some insurmountable barrier between us that should relieve her from such an illfated predilection  Full of these thoughts I proceeded toward the residence of Mr Evelyn It was necessary that I should see him immediately for silence would have been the meanest deceit I went with an afflicted heart But how did I return Why do I say afflicted No Anguish real anguish since I had known him had not yet reached me But it was coming It was rushing forward like a torrent to bear away inferior cares and sorrows and engulph them wholly  Unexpected events are sometimes peculiarly marked by certain uncommon incidental circumstances As I was walking hastily forward anxious to meet Mr Evelyn at home I saw a coffin borne  before me by four men at some distance Their pace was brisk I had several streets to pass before I arrived at the house where Mr Evelyn had apartments and still the coffin turned the way that I was to go  I overtook and went before it but the gloomy object had excited my attention and I presently looked behind me Still it took the same route I looked again and again and it was continually at my heels  It is strange how imagination will work and how ideas will suggest themselves I wished is any where else but it seemed to pursue me  At length I came to my journey's end and having knocked at the door looked round with a kind of infatuated fear The coffin was following and I stood with an absurd and fanciful trepidation waiting that I might once see it fairly past the door Yet I was no bigot no believer  in omens and was almost ashamed of an idea which the coffin itself and the gloomy state of my mind had suggested but which was in reality superstitious The servant came and the door was opened but the coffin approached and I would not stir till it should pass me  Pass it did But where Into the passage  I stood speechless The men asked where it was to go "Into the first floor" was the answer  It was the apartment of Mr Evelyn  Heavens What was the pang that shot across my brain I gasped for utterance but still was dumb A dread so terrible had seized me that there I stood motionless and stupefied  The woman who opened the door and directed the men belonged to the house and just as the bearers were proceeding with the coffin up stairs Matthew the country servant who had attended Mr  Evelyn in the dissecting room the first night of our meeting came in  The moment he saw me the poor fellow burst into tears and exclaimed "Oh sir"  His look and the tone of his voice were sufficient There was but one event that could have produced them in such an extraordinary and unfeigned degree of grief My horrible fears were fulfilled  He paused a moment sobbed and again cried in a most piercing and lamentable tone "My poor master"  I must draw the curtain over feelings that I cannot pretend to paint How long I stood what I first said or what my looks were are things of which I know nothing I only recollect that my eyes were stone and had not a tear to shed  CHAP XI A PROOF OF THE DANGER OF NOT ATTENDING TO TRIFLES A FEEBLE ATTEMPT TO CHARACTERISE A MAN OF UNCOMMON VIRTUE THE DYING ANXIETIES OF MR EVELYN  THE melancholy particulars of this strange tragedy were that three days before Mr Evelyn being then in perfect health had been dissecting a limb in a high state of putrescene During the operation the instrument had slipped and made what he considered only as a scratch of the skin and so slight that he did not immediately deem it worthy of notice though when he had ended he felt a tingling and then thought it prudent to wash with vinegar and bind it up to keep out the air  He was so busily engaged during the day that he paid no more attention to it though he once or twice felt a throbbing  that was unusual Being fatigued and finding his spirits rather agitated he took a gentle opiate at going to rest but was waked in the middle of the night by symptoms of a very alarming kind The morbid humour that was introduced into the system small as it probably was in quantity was so active that Mr Evelyn was seized with a violent inflammatory fever so that he was delirious when he woke and died in less than eight and forty hours after he received this slight wound  Such is the uncertain fate of man in this state of ignorance To such sudden accidents of sickness and death are the good and the bad the foolish and the wise continually subject and such at present is the frail tenure of life that the man in whose hall we feasted on Monday or the blooming beauty with whom we sung and danced ere the week passes away are descended to the grave  What tribute can friendship or affection pay to the memory of a man like this There is only one that is worthy of his virtues and that is to record them that he being gone his example may inspire the benevolence he practised and teach others to communicate the blessings he conferred  Oh that I had the power to pourtray those virtues in all their lustre Ages unborn would then rejoice that such a man had lived and feel the benefits he would have bestowed But it is a task that cannot be accomplished in a few pages His life was a vast volume of the best of actions which originated in the best of principles Peace love and reverence be with his memory  For my own part if in addition to that uncommon public worth which he possessed and that noble scale of morality by which he regulated his life the personal kindness which he heaped on me be remembered  I must have less of affection than savage brutality did no portion of his spirit inspire me while I speak of these events  Nor did his friendship end while understanding had the least remaining power His last act of benevolence was a strenuous but incoherent effort to prevent the mischief which disturbed as his functions were he still had recollection enough to apprehend would fall on me  The reader is informed of the mortgage I gave Mr Evelyn when I received not merely a qualification but the possession of an estate and I imagine he will not think I was too scrupulously careful to guard and prove the honesty of my intentions when I further tell him that for the sums of money which Mr Evelyn advanced I insisted on giving my promissory notes for repayment I was pertinacious and would accept such favours on no other terms  This mortgage and these notes were lying in the possession of Mr Evelyn at the time of his death He had apprehended no danger till the fever and the delirium seized him at the beginning of which he called his servant Matthew I tell the story as the poor fellow told it to me and giving him a key bade him go down to his bureau and search among his papers for a parchment and some notes that were tied together with red tape  Having uttered this he began to talk in a wild and wandering manner of fetters and prisons and asked Matthew if he knew why such places were built "So make haste Matthew" said he "and burn the parchment and burn the notes and burn the bureau After which you know all will be safe Matthew and they can never harm Mr Trevor You love Mr Trevor Matthew do not you"  His recollection then seemed to return and he asked "Of what have I been talking Go Matthew seek the parchment and the notes tied with red tape Observe there is no other parchment tied with red tape Bring them to me directly"  Matthew had taken the key but just as he was going the Doctor who had been sent for arrived  Matthew went however as he was directed and applying the key to the lock found it was a wrong one  The Doctor alarmed for the state in which he saw Mr Evelyn immediately wrote a prescription and rang for the servant to run and have it prepared at the shop of the next apothecary Matthew answered the bell and Mr Evelyn seeing him eagerly demanded "Where is the parchment Have you brought me the parchment Why do not you bring me the parchment"  "For" said Matthew "I held out the key and he saw I had nothing else in my hands"  The Doctor asked Matthew what parchment his master wanted And Matthew replied he could not tell except that his master said it was in the bureau and tied with red tape "Why do not you bring it" said Mr Evelyn Then turning to the Doctor added"It is a bundle of misery and you know sir we ought to drive all misery from the face of the earth I cannot tell how it came in my possession Why do you not go and bring it me Matthew And pray sir do you see it destroyed Promise me that I beg you will Because Mr Trevor is in the country I am afraid elections are but bad things What sir is your opinion For I think I shall die and he will then have no friend on earth to secure him the poll"  "Seeing my poor master was so disturbed  in his mind" said Matthew "the doctor  bid  me run as fast as I could for the stuff he had ordered which I did But I was obliged to wait till it was made up and when I  come  back my poor dear master was more distracting lightheaded than ever But still he kept raving about the parchment and his cousin Sir Barnard and you Mr Trevor all which the Doctor said we must not heed because he did not know what he said Though for all that I could not but mightily fear there was something hung heavy on his mind for as long as ever he could be heard to speak he kept calling every now and then for the parchment And after that when he lay heaving for breath and rattling in the throat and nobody could tell a word that he said he kept moving his lips just in the same manner as when he could make himself heard I do believe he was calling for it almost as the breath left  his body And I cannot but say that I wish I had found it and brought it to him for the ease and quiet of his soul"  CHAP XII DOUBTS CONCERNING THE JUSTICE OF WILLS AND TESTAMENTS THE PROVIDENT CARE OF THE BARONET A DEMONSTRATION OF HIS ARDENT LOVE FOR HIS COUNTRY HECTOR LOSES HIS ELECTION MY DETERMINATION TO ACCEPT THE CHILTERN HUNDREDS  WHEN a man discovers that the pathos of his story and the virtues which he has in contemplation are entirely beyond the power of language what method can he take but that of leaving off abruptly that he may suffer the imagination to perform an office to which any other effort is inadequate As Mr Evelyn lived so he died To prevent evil and to do unbounded good was his  ruling passion It never left him till life departed  It is a phenomenon which has frequently been remarked that in a state of delirium the mind has its luminous moments during which it seems to have a more clear and comprehensive view of consequences than in its more sober periods of health The evil that excited so strong and painful an alarm in the mind of my dying friend was no idle dream The Baronet was his heir at law Mr Evelyn had made no will for not only was his death premature but knowing the mischiefs that have arisen from disputes concerning testamentary bequests he strongly doubted of the morality of making any It was never his intention to hoard and hoping or I might rather say expecting to have a clear prospect of the approach of death his plan was to distribute all the personal property in his possession before he died in the manner  that he should suppose would be most useful  However whether it were a just sense of rectitude or an improper pride of heart I own that I felt pleased as far as myself was concerned that the intentions of Mr Evelyn when he called for the parchment were not executed I did not indeed foresee all that was to happen but I felt an abhorrence of being liable to be suspected of I know not what imputed arts or crimes by the aid of which malice or selfishness might assert I had come into the possession of so large a part of Mr Evelyn's property  Not that if the deeds and notes had been destroyed I should have thought it just to have retained the estate that I held But my virtue was not fated to be put to this trial When I met Sir Barnard at the Cocoa tree he not only knew of the decease of Mr Evelyn but had ordered seals to be placed on all the locks under  which it was imagined that papers or effects might be secured Having heard the story of Matthew I could have no doubt but that the mortgage deeds and the notes for sums received would now fall into the Baronet's power  It is true I might if I pleased bid him defiance No I ought not to have said if I pleased but if I could condescend to acknowledge myself a scoundrel He had made me his own member and had himself impowered me to avoid the punishment which is assigned by law to unfortunate debtors for under this best of governments such as a representative of the people was now my privilege This immaculate constitution to which all the homage that man can pay is insufficient worship vaunted as it is and revered by all parties or all parties are broad day liars for all and each strive to be most loud and extravagant in praise of it this constitution in its very essence  decrees that things which are vile and unjust in one man are right and lawful in another  Well then by the aid of this constitution which I too must praise if I would escape whipping I might seat myself as Sir Barnard's member and aid to countenance and make laws to which I and the other wise lawmakers my coadjutors should not be subject I might however offensive the term may be to certain delicate ears I might become a privileged swindler and rob every man who should do me the injustice to think me honest  It cannot be supposed that so dear a lover and so ardent an admirer of the constitution as Sir Barnard was should once suspect that I would not benefit myself by all its blessings that is that I would not cheat him to the very best of my ability This supposition had induced him during our conversation at  the Cocoa tree to struggle with and keep down those indignant risings with which notwithstanding the modulated tone of his voice I could see he was more than half choaked  After what I had heard and situated as I was at present I had very little doubt either of the purity of his patriotism or the manner in which it would affect me Still however I had some There might be a change in his politics but it might neither be of the nature nor of the extent that I feared  But these doubts did not distress me long They were entirely removed by that most authentic source of intelligence the Gazette in which about a fortnight after the death of Mr Evelyn I read the following unequivocal proof of the Baronet's inordinate love of his country  "The King has been pleased to grant the dignity of a Baron of the kingdom of  Great Britain to Sir Barnard Bray Baronet by the name stile and title of Baron Bray of Bray hall in the county of Somerset and to the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten"  I was now no longer at a loss for the reason of the Baronet's late sudden departure and the desertion of his political friends at the election What are friends What are elections What is our country compared to the smiles of a prime minister and the titles he can bestow Nothing now was wanting to the honor of the house of Bray It might in time I own pant after a Dukedom and a Duke of Bray might as justly be stiled princely and most puissant as many another Duke But at present it was full with satisfaction  This court document brief though it was spoke volumes It was a flash of lightning that gave me a distinct view of the black and dreadful abyss that was  immediately before me and into which I foresaw I must be plunged  On the same day I read that the Idford candidate had been returned for the county of * * * * and that consequently Hector had lost his election  This was not all Heated by the illiberal practices which always attend such contentions knowing the bribery that he had used himself and convinced that he could prove the same corrupt means to have been resorted to by his opponent he was not satisfied with the devastation he had already committed upon his fortune but was determined to demand a  scrutiny  and if he should be foiled in that effort he was resolved to try the merits of the election before a committee of the house of commons Such was the report that was immediately propagated and which was afterward verified by facts  With respect to myself convinced as  I was of its danger I had made my choice My fixed purpose was to vacate my seat in parliament It might perhaps be questioned since the pretended voters had in reality no voice and their imaginary representative was no more than a person nominated by the new Lord Bray whether I ought to resign an office which as I supposed I should fill for the good of mankind and give place to some person who obedient to his leader would do the reverse  But one act of baseness cannot authorize another To bear about me a sense of selfdegradation a certainty that I was sheltering myself from the power of my late patron by a privilege which I considered as highly vicious a subterfuge such as every man who deserves the name ought to despise and spurn at this was insufferable I had lost much for I had lost hopes that had been extravagant and unbounded in promise but  I had not lost a conscious rectitude of heart without which existence was not to be endured  CHAP XIII THE COMEDY OF WILMOT SUCCESSFUL THE WOUNDED STRANGER SEEN AT A DISTANCE ORATORY ABANDONED WITH REGRET THE DANGERS THAT ATTEND BEING HONEST A NEW INVITATION FROM HECTOR A JOURNEY DEFERRED BY AN ARREST AND ANOTHER ACCIDENTAL SIGHT OF THE STRANGER  IT is happy for man that there is scarcely any state of suffering whether of mind or body in which pain is unremitting and wholly unmixed with pleasure If he be unhappy himself it will be strange should there be no one more fortunate for whom he has an affection no friend that is more prosperous and in whose prosperity he takes delight  The season of the year had arrived when the comedy of Wilmot had been put into rehearsal and was to be performed It was a trying occasion and those who knew him loved him too well to be absent though the few intimate friends who had read the piece had no doubt of its success The partial failure of his tragedy had produced no jealousy of rivalship though as its merits had been publicly acknowledged it had incurred no disgrace In private life he was beloved and as a public man his merits had not yet created him enemies He has since indeed in that respect not been so fortunate But he has never thought it just to complain being convinced that mistake though it should be rectified should not be resented  The evening of representation arrived the house was crowded the company brilliant and the plaudits with which the author was honoured eslablished his reputation  and confirmed the judgment of his friends  During the performance I sat in the boxes and among the spectors in the pit I discovered a man whose hair was white whose locks were venerable and who I was well convinced was the stranger whom I had found wounded at the entrance of Barnes common I was in a sidebox and he was near the opposite pit door so that the distance made it rather doubtful yet the more I looked the more I was convinced it was the same person The comedy was nearly ended when I first saw him and I determined as soon as I had heard the epilogue to go and satisfy myself how far my persuasion was true  I went round to the door but the pit was so crowded that it was with difficulty I could make my way to the seat When I was there my labour was lost I could not find him and enquiring for him  by description of the persons near where he sat they told me that such a gentleman had been there but that he complained of the heat and had left the house immediately after the curtain dropped  This incident gave me considerable chagrin However as his person was very remarkable and being persuaded he was actually the wounded stranger I conceived hopes that I should again meet him in some place where the danger of losing sight of him would not be so great  There being no expectation of his return I went in search of my friends in company with whom rejoicing in the success of Wilmot and glorying in the acquisition of poetry and the stage I wholly forgot myself and my own affairs and spent one more very delightful evening  These affairs however were not long to be forgotten The returns of the elections throughout Great Britain had all  been made and the new parliament summoned to assemble It was with infinite and deep regret that I found myself excluded by my own sense of rectitude I would willingly have taken my seat had it been only for one night for I was eagerly desirous of an opportunity to deliver my thoughts and urge some of those useful truths which may be uttered with more safety there than in less privileged places  But I was too well acquainted with the customs and forms of the house to hope that this opportunity could now be found I had no parliamentary friends no supporters and there was not the least probability that a youth so wholly unknown should  catch the speaker's eye  whose notice so many were ready to solicit  These things having been duly weighed I had already applied for the chiltern hundreds and my seat was declared vacated  to the great joy of Lord Bray and his now bosom friend the Earl of Idford This joy was the greater because it was an event of which they had not the least expectation The due forms of law had been observed the seals had been removed from the locks of my late inestimable friend his cousin the new peer was in possession of the mortgage and the notes for money received and he had no conception of any motives that could induce me to an act which must leave me entirely at his mercy  It cannot however be supposed as I have already said that I had any intention to retain the estate which I had received from Mr Evelyn as a qualification and a support It was now the property of Lord Bray and obligation to him was a thing that would not admit of a question I did not therefore wait for any notice from his lordship or his attorney  but desired Mr Hilary to inform him that I was ready at any time to give up the deeds and receive back the mortgage  This would have been a trifle It was not a sacrifice but a riddance by which could it have ended here I should have regained something of that elasticity of heart which independence only can feel Here however it could not end I was obliged to instruct Mr Hilary to add that I was willing to give my own personal securiry by bond or in any manner my creditor should please for money received and interest due but to acknowledge that I had no immediate means of payment In other words that my person was entirely at the disposal of himself and the law I might have reminded him that more than half of my debt was incurred by  genteel presents  to his craving electors and that he had informed  me that it was a necessary expence but to this I could not condescend  The little business which during his life Mr Evelyn had in law Mr Hilary had always transacted He had a sincere regard for me and a reverence for the memory of his late kinsman whose earnest recommendation of me he did not forget Being well acquainted with the character of Lord Bray he foresaw and warned me of my danger While a baronet to behold himself a peer had been his lordship's darling passion but that was now gratified and as he was proud he was likewise revengeful In this case however to warn was useless I had no alternative except by means that were dishonorable  Nor was the resentment of Lord Bray single or so much to be apprehended as that of the Earl with whom he had entered into strict alliance My behaviour  to Lord Idford had uniformly been what he deemed so very insolent that his antipathy may be said to have taken birth at my first act of disobedience my refusal to dine at the second table Since then as he conceived it had been progressive in aggravation My scorn of his selfish politics my attempt to continue the Letters of Themistocles and write him who was the supposed author of them into disgrace the pamphlet of which I was the author the activity with which I had canvassed in favour of Mowbray and to sum up all my daring to rival him with the woman on whom he would have conferred his person his dignity and his other great qualities were all of them injuries that rankled at his heart When these things are remembered few will feel surprised that the Earl should indulge a passion which is in itself so active or that he should induce Lord Bray to pursue that kind of conduct  to which he was already so much disposed  The danger however must be faced and Mr Hilary wrote as my attorney to state the circumstances above recited A week elapsed before he received an answer but at the end of that time his lordship's attorney replied that personal security for so large a sum could not be accepted my bond would be no better than the notes I had given and that I was required immediately to pay what was due to the estate and heirs of the late Mr Evelyn  The spirit in which this note was written proved the temper of my creditor and an incident soon occurred by which his propensity to persecute was called into action The scrutiny which Hector had demanded was over and decided against him but understanding that there was an absolute breach between me and Lord Bray Mowbray  was convinced that he had accused me falsely As he was almost certain that he could prove bribery and corruption to have been practised by his opponent he persisted in determining to bring it before the house of commons This business kept him still in the country where he and his partisans were busily collecting information  He had experienced my utility in the course of the election he wished to enjoy the same advantage at present and he and his committee likewise discovered that my evidence was essentially necessary He therefore wrote me an apology spoke in the handsomest terms he could recollect of the services I had done him requested me to come down once more to aid him in his present attempt and stated the points on which my future testimony would be useful He further informed me that a gentleman of the law whom he named was to set off the morning  after I should receive the letter at ten o'clock and come post and that he should be much obliged to me if I would take a seat in the same chaise  The letter was read in the committee room as a matter of business and in this committee room Lord Idford had a secret agent from whom he gained intelligence of all their proceedings that deserved notice  Desirous as I was of obliging the brother of Olivia I made no hesitation to comply The evening before I was to go down into * * * * * I went to Mr Hilary to acquaint him with the place of my destination and the manner in which he might direct to me if any thing new should occur The agents of Lord Bray or to speak more truly of the Earl had been exceedingly industrious and a writ was already procured It was intended to take me as I stepped into the chaise or that evening if possible and  accordingly the door where I lived was watched and I was seen to come out My usual pace was brisk but I happened now to be in haste and as they told me themselves the setters lost sight of me for some time were afterward cautious of coming up to me in any public street where a rescue was probable and followed me till I came almost to the door of Mr Hilary  Here there was a carriage standing and to my great surprisfe and joy I saw Mr Hilary with a light conducting out the very person whom I had some time before discovered in the pit and whom I now knew to be the wounded stranger  I hesitated whether I ought to spring forward and intrude my enquiries immediately upon him or make them of Mr Hilary with whom it appeared he was acquainted and at this instant the bailiff and his two men came up with me and told me I was their prisoner  While I stood astonished at this sudden and at that precise time unexpected event the carriage with the stranger in it drove away and Mr Hilary shut the door without seeing me  There is a sense of indignity and disgrace in being arrested at which all those who have not been frequently subjected to it revolt I was wholly ignorant of the manners of the people who had laid their hands upon me I had heard of giving bail but I had likewise heard that it was a thing of danger to which men were generally averse and I had a bitter repugnance to ask any thing which I thought it was likely should be refused Neither had I any probable person to ask for my little law reading had taught me that the sureties of a debtor must be housekeepers  Unwilling therefore to trouble Mr Hilary and finding myself without resource  I desired the bailiff to take me wherever he pleased or wherever the law directed "I suppose Sir you do not mean we should take you to jail" said the bailiff  Ignorant as I was and surprised at the question I asked where else they meant to take me He replied "To my house Sir or to any other lock up house that you choose"  "A lock up house Sir" said I "Pray what is that "  The bailiff knew not how to give a direct answer but replied "There  is  some lock up houses at which a gentleman may be treated like a gentleman though I cannot say but there  is  others that  is  shabby enough I see very well Sir you are a young gentleman and do not know the trim of such things so if you please to go to my house you will find very civil usage I can tell by your  cut Sir that you are no scrub so my wife will take care to furnish you with every thing that is genteel and polite"  The man smelled excessively of brandy and tobacco which corresponding with his gait looks and language seemed an introduction to the purgatory to which I was doomed I thought proper however to accept his offer and go to the house where I was to be treated with so much politeness and gentility  CHAP XIV THE GOOD BREEDING OF A BAILIFF A PERIOD OF DEJECTION A VISIT FROM MR HILARY THE HOPES HE CONCEIVES  THE bailiff and one of his followers walked beside me cautioulsy keeping in advance and the other marched behind till we came to a stand of coaches and I  was asked whether one of them should be called I was thoroughly ashamed of my company but a deep sense of indignity confuses thought and till it was proposed by the bailiff I had forgotten that there was such a thing as a coach His proposal was immediately accepted and we were driven through Lincoln'sinnfields into Careystreet where we were obliged to alight and pass through several narrow allies  I had no great expectations of the gentility of the bailiff's abode but slender as they were the few I had were disappointed I was wholly unused to such places this I suspect was one of the meanest of them and the approach to the house as well as all that was in it bespoke wretchedness and inspired disgust  As soon as we entered the doors the bailiff called aloud for Charlotte the name of his wife and desired her to bring light into the drawing room  "Why what do you talk of George" replied Charlotte "Are you drunk Don't you know the gentleman is there that you brought in this morning"  "Do you think I don't know what I am about" answered George "I have brought another gentleman so that there gentleman must come down and  hoik  into the best parlour"  "I am sure" retorted Charlotte with great vivacity and significance "he has behaved vastly proper since he came into my house He has had friends with him all afternoon and dined and called for wine and done every thing that was genteel"  Though half in a trance I was sufficiently awake to understand her meaning I therefore interrupted the bailiff who had begun to reply with passion "You are very right Madam" said I "The gentleman must not be disturbed  I have no friends that drink wine and I drink none myself"  This hint was quite sufficient Neither the drawing room nor the best parlour were now to be had and I was shewn into a dirty back place which was little more than a closet decorated with a wooden cut of Lord Lovat over the mantle piece and corresponding pictures of the king and queen on each side  Before she shut the door Charlotte demanded "if I chose to have some more coals on the fire And whether I would have two candles or one "Whatever you please madam" I replied "Nay sir" said she pertly "that is just as you please" I made no answer and she shut the door with a dissatisfied air which she locked on the outside  At any other time this George and Charlotte with their drawingroom would  have presented many whimsical associations to my mind but at present my attention was called to the iron bars of the one window of my prison hole and to the recolleclion that in all probability I was now shut up for life The weight of evil was so oppressive that I sat motionless in sullen stupefaction for a considerable time  Hearing no sound whatever the bailiff I suppose was alarmed for he unlocked the door and coming in abruptly exclaimed "Oh I thought it could not be" Meaning probably that I could not possibly have escaped through the window Recollecting himself he asked "if I did not think proper to send to some friends" To which I laconically answered "No"  "But I suppose you mean to give bail sir"  "I have none to give"  "I perceive how it is sir You are  not used to the business and so you are cast down You must bethink yourself for I dare say a young gentleman like you will find bail fast enough  becase  why the sum is not quite four hundred and forty pounds We have people enough  which  will go of any message for you so I would advise you to send though it is late  becase  as you  says  you don't drink there will be no good much in your staying here Not but what we have as good beds and as good wines and all sorts of liquors and can get any thing else as good as a gentleman needs lick his lips to There  is  never  no  complaints at our house So you had better take my advice and cheer up your spirits and get a little something good in your belly in the way of eating and drinking and send to let your friends know as how you are  nabbed becase  nothing can come of it otherwise neither to you  no  body else"  His discourse awakened me enough to remind me of the necessity of sending to the gentleman with whom I had intended to travel the next day and inform him of the impossibility of my taking the journey This led me to reflect further The remark of the bailiff was just delay was prejudicial What had happened could not be kept secret secrecy was in itself vicious and to increase evil by procrastination was cowardly Thus far roused I presently conceived and determined on my plan I saw no probability of avoiding a prison but being in this house I was resolved first to see my friends I had already sold my horses and discharged my servant Clarke I knew would reproach me if I did not accept his good offices in my distress when such good offices as he could perform would be most necessary I intended therefore to request him the next morning to go round and inform such of  my friends as I wished to see but as the bailiff told me it would be proper to send for my attorney immediately I thought proper to dispatch a messenger with one note to him and another to the gentleman with whom I was to have travelled  Mr Hilary was at home and came instantly on the receipt of my billet When he saw me he endeavoured to smile and not appear in the least surprised or affected But his feelings betrayed him the tears started into his eyes and he was obliged to turn away his face He made an effort however and recovered himself after which he rather endeavoured to enter into easy conversation than to talk of business By this I suspected that he neither durst trust himself nor me till a little time should have reconciled us to the scene  This was a proper opportunity for enquiries which my sudden misfortune had not made me forget I questioned him  concerning the stranger whose person I described and mentioned my having seen Mr Hilary light him out of the house the moment before I was arrested  "What do you know of him" said Mr Hilary with an eager air "Have you ever seen him before"  "Yes if I am not very much mistaken"  "Nay but tell me what do you know"  "First answer me concerning who and what he is"  "A gentleman of large fortune the last of his family and a great traveller"  "Has he met with any accident lately"  "Yes But why do you ask"  "And why do you seem so much awakened by the question"  "Because he is excessively desirous of discovering some gentleman who found him after he had been robbed and left  supposed to be dead that he may if possible reward his preserver Now there are some circumstances as related by the people of an inn to which he was taken that have suggested a thought to me which should it prove true would give me inexpressible pleasure"  "What are they"  "That the good Samaritan who performed this act of humanity was a young gentleman with a servant out of livery that he and his man rode two blood horses both bright bays that the servant's name was Samuel and that the master was in person very like you All which correspond and I really believe by your smiling that it actually was you"  "Suppose it what then"  "Why then I am sure you have gained a friend who will never suffer you to go to prison"  The word friend conjured up a train of  ideas which almost overcame me "I have lost a friend" said I "who would not have suffered me to go to prison But he is gone I accepted even  his  favours with an aching and unwilling heart and prison itself will not I suspect be so painful to me as more obligations of the same kind and conferred by a person who though I am strongly prepossessed in his favour I scarcely can hope should equal Mr Evelyn And if he even did an extravagant supposition I should still hesitate I doubt if a prison itself be so hateful as a knowledge that I am only out of one on sufferance and that when any caprice shall seize my creditor I may be hunted like a ferocious beast and commanded to my den like a crouching cur  Mr Hilary endeavoured to combat this train of thinking but it was not to be conquered The short period of trial since the death of Mr Evelyn had afforded  me too many proofs of the painful sensations which such a knowledge can excite and of the propensity which I had to give them encouragement To be as I have said the slave of any man's temper not as an effort of duty but from a sense of fear was insufferable A prison locks bolts and bread and water were to be preferred  Mr Hilary sat with me till bed time and not only to put the bailiff in good humour but to cheer my heart and his own ordered supper and drank more plentifully of wine than was his custom urging me to follow his example I did not refuse for I had a contempt for any thing that had the appearance of an incapacity to endure whatever the tyranny of rancorous men and unjust laws could inflict The stranger he told me was gone down into the country from whence he would return within a week but he forbore to mention his name as he  had been instructed the stranger having enquiries to make which induced him to keep it secret  Before he left me Mr Hilary received instructions from me to be given to Clarke after which we quitted the best parlour into which we had been introduced with great ceremony to sup and I retired to try how soundly I could sleep in one of the good beds of a lockup house  CHAP XV MORNING VISITORS A GENEROUS PROPOSAL REJECTED THE AFFECTIONATE FRIENDSHIP OF MISS WILMOT A VERY UNEXPECTED VISITOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT AND A SCENE OF RECONCILIATION A LETTER WHICH EXCITES DELIGHTFUL SENSATIONS  THE morning came the diligence of Mr Hilary was that of a friend and the best parlour was soon filled the reader will easily guess by whom There is an undescribable pleasure when we are persecuted  by one set of human beings to receive marks of affection from another It is a strong consolation to know that kindness and justice have not wholly forsaken the earth  Wilmot Clarke and Turl were with me I called for breakfast and felt a gratification at enjoying another social meal before being immured in I knew not what kind of dungeon Charlotte and her maid Pol were very alert and I believe she almost repented that I was not in the drawingroom since she found I had so many friends  Clarke was asked to partake but answered with a "no thank you Mr Trevor" I supposed it was awkward bashfulness I did him wrong He had a more refined and feeling motive for when I pressed him very earnestly he replied" At another time Mr Trevor such a favour would make me happy and you know I have not refused but just  now why it would look as if because you are under misfortunes I might take liberties"  Honesthearted generous fellow He was still the same But he breakfasted with us Be assured good reader he breakfasted with us  And now I had a contest to undergo which was maintained with so much obstinacy that it became truly painful Wilmot in consequence of the success of his comedy had the power to discharge my debt and on this at first he peremptorily insisted But it was what I could not accept He was I knew an Evelyn in soul but I too panted to be something I could not endure to rob him of the labour of a life and walk at large oppressed by the consciousness of impotence of a depressed and sunken spirit of which groveling meanness would be the chief feature Such at least  were my sensations and they were too impetuous to be overcome  In the ardour we mutually felt Turl was appealed to by both At first he strongly inclined to the side of Wilmot but hearing my reasons and perceiving the anguish which the proposal gave he at length said"Let us pause awhile We are friends Imprisonment is a detestable thing and there is no danger that as friends we should suffer each other to endure it long if there should be any possible and honest means of imparting freedom We need make no professions In one part of his argument Mr Trevor is undoubtedly right If he can relieve himself by his abilities and industry which he is persuaded he can it is his duty For it will not only increase his immediate happiness but it will give confidence to his efforts and strength to his mind qualities that are inestimable  Impediments serve but to rouse the man of genius To reject aid from a sentiment of haughtiness is a vice but to despair of our own resources is the death of all true greatness of character In any case suspend your contest in which though from the best of motives you are both too warm Examine your arguments at leisure If Mr Trevor can be rendered most happy and useful by accepting your offer it will then be just in him to cede but remember once more we are friends that know each other's worth and it will be just that I should partake in his release To this I know you will both joyfully consent If good can be done you will not deny me my share"  It was characteristic of Turl never to speak on serious occasions without leaving a deep impression on his hearers Wilmot heaved a profound sigh but was silent  Having thus far prevailed I was desirous of being immediately removed to prison but to this they both vehemently objected It had an air of ostentation of affecting to love misery for misery's sake Time ought to be taken for consideration and evil should not be sported with though when unavoidable it ought to be endured with fortitude  While these debates took place it was no uninteresting spectacle to contemplate the changes in the countenance of Clarke Before the adventure of Bath he had risen much above the level of his companions but now when he saw a man willing to part with all he possessed to rescue another from prison and heard strong reasons why it was probable the offer ought not to be accepted his feelings were all in arms His passions while Wilmot pleaded were ready to break their bounds and when he listened to the answers that were returned his mind was filled and  expanded He discovered that there is a disinterested grandeur in morality of which he had no previous conception He was in a new world and a dark room with barred windows was heaven in all its splendor  Having agreed to follow their advice Wilmot and Turl left me with a promise to return early in the evening but poor Clarke said "he had no heart for work that day and he could not abide to leave me shut up by myself He saw plainly enough I had true friends such as would never forsake me and no more would he though he could do me no good" When however I represented to him my wish to be alone that I might consider on my situation and requested he would dine with his family and bring some books from my lodgings in the evening he complied  The morning of the day was chiefly consumed and I was not suffered long  to remain alone I had scarcely dined before a coach stopped at the door and Charlotte came in with demure significance in her face "There is a young lady sir" said she "  which  says her name is Wilmot  which  wants to see you"  At this moment she was the most agreeable visitor that could have arrived Her heart was full her eyes were swollen and red with weeping and as soon as she entered the room she again burst into tears  It has often been asked why sorrows like these should excite so much gratification The answer is evident They are not only tokens of personal respect and affection but they are proofs that injustice cannot be committed without being perceptibly and often deeply felt by others as well as by those on whom it is exercised  When she had appeased her feelings sufficiently to be able to speak I found  that like her brother she was come with a disinterested plan for my relief She began by blaming herself for not having strenuously enough opposed my forbearance with respect to Wakefield and pleaded with great energy of feeling to persuade me immediately to do myself right I took the first favourable opportunity to interrupt her and enquired if she had seen or heard any thing of Wakefield since the letter he wrote She answered he had been with her above an hour that very morning  "In what temper of mind was he"  "Extremely exasperated"  "Not at you"  "Oh no at Lord Bray at your persecutors at the world in general He says you are not fit to live in it you are no match for it You have been persuading him contrary to all history and experience that men are capable of virtue and happiness In short he owns  that he was more than half convinced but that he believes he shall be obliged to relapse into his former opinions"  "I have persuaded him"  "So he says"  "When Where"  "I cannot tell I thought from his discourse that he had met with you"  While we were engaged in this conversation Charlotte again entered and told me there was a gentleman of the name of Wakefield who desired to see me "Is it possible" exclaimed Miss Wilmot  The door opened and he appeared "Belmont" cried I with surprise "Why did you announce yourself by the name of Wakefield"  He stretched out his hand to me and turned his face aside then recovering himself replied "The farce is over"  "What do you mean"  "That I suppose you will despise me  But do if you please for though I love you I too despise to fear you I have done you various wrongs My name is Wakefield I have been one of the infernal instruments to bring you here but I am come to make you all the atonement in my power and take you out Forgive me only so far as not to insult me by repeating your contempt of that villain Wakefield It is a damned undigestible term but I deserved it and you applied it to me without intending an affront I know you are as brave as you are generous Till I met with you I thought myself the first man in the world but notwithstanding my evasive raillery I felt your hand upon me I sunk under you There was something in you that excited my envy at first and afterward perhaps a better passion What damned accidents they were that made me what I have been I cannot tell I know not what I shall be but I know  what I am I disdain penitential promises If you will be my friend here is my hand Good fortune or bad we will share it together"  Thus invited could I refrain Oh no I cannot describe the scene that passed We did not embrace for we were no actors and as our passions for a time were too big for utterance we were silent  Miss Wilmot at length looked up and while the tears were streaming down her cheeks her countenance assumed an expression infinitely beyond smiling though something like it while she exclaimed"This is a happy day"  Her eye first met mine and then Wakefield's He instantly hung his head and said"Lydia When we were alone I could just endure to look at you but now I cannot Yet I am an ass What is done is done The affections that I have are yours but  I must not no nor I will not be afraid even of my own thoughts I know I have nothing to fear from you Man is a strange animal and may be many things in the course of a short life"  Wakefield then rang the bell and desired the bailiff would send immediately to Lord Bray's attorney that my debts might be settled and I released and to call as he knew they must for form's sake and see that there were no more detainders  Hearing him give these directions I could not but ask his meaning "What" replied he with generous indignation "do you suppose that I am come to cant about virtue That at least is a vice of which you have never yet found me guilty I am here to pay your debts with money in my possession Whether in a court of law it would be proved to be yours or mine I neither know nor care But there is something better that  I do know which is that if I were in your place and you in mine you would not long let me remain in a house like this With respect to the future I am partly persuaded we shall neither of us act the miser"  Miss Wilmot again exclaimed"This is a happy day"  Wakefield was impatient to see me released and was well acquainted with bailiffs "If you are expeditious" said he to George "you will have a guinea for your industry If you are dilatory not a farthing more than your fees"  The promised guinea gave the messenger wings and in less than an hour the debt was discharged and a receipt in full delivered  Just as this account was closed another messenger came from a different quarter The anxiety of Miss Wilmot had induced her to take a bold step In the first emotions of grief she wrote to Olivia  and informed her of every circumstance as well as of the place of my detention This information produced the following letter and the bills inclosed as mentioned in its contents  I have no words to speak my feelings I have never yet had an opportunity since I thought the love I bear you justifiable to declare them This is the time To be silent now would argue a distrust of you which would degrade me and render me unworthy both of you and the dignified virtues by which your conduct is guided Every new fact that I hear of you does but increase that affection which I find ennobled by being so worthily placed After the proofs you have so repeatedly given it would be cowardice and hypocrisy to say less  I inclose you five hundred pounds They are my own I would sooner even see you suffer than be guilty of an action which I know you could not approve  They are what I have reserved from money allowed me to be employed on any urgent occasion Surely there can be few more urgent than the present Your refusal of them would wound me to the soul It would break my heart I need not add any thing more  OLIVIA MOWBRAY  Who will tell me that virtue is not its own reward Who will affirm that to conquer selfish desires to render the passions subservient to reason and to make those principles we commend in others rules for ourselves is not the way to be happy The tide of joy was full to overflowing And yet when I recollected that though no longer a prisoner it was denied me to obey the yearnings of my heart and pass the threshold of Olivia how suddenly did it ebb  CHAP XVI A JOURNEY TO AID HECTOR ONCE MORE PROJECTED AN INTERVIEW WITH THE WOUNDED STRANGER A DISCOVERY OF GREAT IMPORTANCE  I SHALL forbear to repeat the joy and congratulations of friends with other less events and hasten to one which gave a more surprising turn to my affairs than even any that I had yet experienced The morning after my release it was my intention to go down into the county of * * * * agreeable to the desire of Hector Of this I informed Mr Hilary the evening before but as I was become very cautious in money matters I meant to go by the coach  When he heard this Mr Hilary smiled and told me if I would go post he believed he could find me a companion who would willingly bear half the expence  I enquired who and found it was no other that the stranger He had been down into Cambridgeshire to settle some affairs and was now preparing for a journey into my native county for purposes which he will himself presently explain A proposal more agreeable than this could not have been made to me and it was agreed that we should meet and breakfast with Mr Hilary When I made the appointment Mr Hilary pressed me with unusual earnestness not to be induced to break it by any accident whatever  The morning came I was punctual and the stranger was there He had slept at the house of Mr Hilary "This sir" said the latter presenting me "is the young gentleman of whose acquaintance you are so very desirous"  The stranger regarded me earnestly and with great emotion in his countenance asked"Are you sir the humane  person who found me almost expiring and by whose care I am now among the living"  "I hope sir you do not think there was any thing extraordinary in what I did"  "I wish I had not reason so to think How many there are who from mean and selfish motives would have passed me I cannot say but there are few indeed that would have discharged the office you undertook with so much unaffected and generous benevolence I am in your debt sir not only for my recovery for which I can never repay you but literally for money expended I shall forbear thanks for I have none that are adequate but suffer me to rid myself of petty obligations"  "I understand sir that you are rich and I am not I therefore inform you without hesitation I left twenty pounds with the physician"  "You may well suppose that I returned after my recovery to enquire for my preserver I was then informed of your whole proceedings and of the anxiety with which after your journey you came to complete the charitable office you had begun And I own sir that I was so desirous of seeing a person who in the very fervour of youth could act and feel as you have done that one excepted you are the man on earth I am most happy to meet"  "Mr Hilary tells me that we are to be travelling companions"  "Most willingly I have long been a wanderer and am lately returned to end my days in my native land During my absence the elder branches of my family are all deceased I brought back with me more than sufficient for my own wants but their property has descended to me and I now very unexpectedly find myself wealthy"  "And have you no descendants sir"  "None I am at present in search of a distant relation whom if I should find and find him such as my present hopes and past knowledge have pictured him I shall be one of the happiest of men To make this and another enquiry is the purpose of the journey I now mean to take When I left England I had no intention ever to return I therefore resolved to hold no correspondence with the persons whom I had left that I might not revive the memory of scenes and events which had been full of anguish By accident about eighteen months ago being then at Grand Cairo I was informed that a person of my family had long been dead This determined me to settle my concerns abroad and revisit my native country As however my informer spoke only from report I am desirous before I make myself known to verify this fact I have my reasons which from what I have said  you may suspect to be those of resentment But not so they are only what I conceive to be necessary precautions Acrimony and anger have long since died away and I have but too much cause to condemn those actions of my life in which they were indulged The relation whom I hope to find I may unfortunately discover to be more likely to misuse the wealth that has devolved to me by the death of the elder branches of my family than to make it a blessing to himself and others It is true he is not my heir at law I have no heir what I possess is at my own disposal But he was once my greatest favourite and I would avoid any action that should excite hopes which it might be weakness and vice in me to gratify"  This short narrative was not merely delivered with a serious air but it was accompanied with somewhat of a plaintive tone that rendered the venerable stranger unusually interesting It likewise  excited various wild yet not impossible conjectures in my mind which made me very eager to pursue the discourse Mr Hilary whose mind had been full of conjectures mingled with doubt had not informed him of my name  "Is the person" said I "in search of whom you mean to take this journey young or old"  "About four and twenty He was the son of my wife's sister therefore my relation only by marriage He was certainly the most extraordinary child I ever beheld I cannot recollect him but with inconceivable emotions of affection Of all the sportive little creatures I ever met with he was the most active the most undaunted and the most winning Heaven bless the sweet boy He was my delight My eyes overflow whenever I recall to mind the seats of his childhood which can never be long forgotten by me My wife and her sister had been at variance and the first time I saw him was at  a fair when he was not five years old I found him placed on a table where he stood reading the newspaper to country farmers who were collected round him and hearing him with astonishment They seemed to doubt if he could possibly be a child born of a woman and were more inclined to think him a supernatural being His flaxen curly hair his intelligent eyes his rosy cheeks his strong and proportioned limbs and his cheerful animated countenance rendered him the most beautiful and most endearing of human creatures The discriminating sensibility which he displayed was enchanting Oh should he be living should I find him and should he be at present all that his infancy promised God of heaven and earth I should expire The pleasure would be too mighty for my years But should I survive it I should once again before I die feel the animating fervor of youth  I listened in amazement I was not then acquainted with all the incidents of my childhood so perfectly as by hearing them repeated I since have been but I knew enough of them to be persuaded the discourse that I had heard could relate only to me I paused I gazed My eyes were riveted upon the narrator At length I exclaimed"What I have just heard sir has excited very strange ideas They seem almost impossible and yet I am persuaded they are true Pardon a question which I cannot refrain to ask Surely I cannot be mistaken Your name is Elford"  "Sir"  "You are my"  "Speak Go on What am I"  "My uncle"  "Heavens Mr Trevor Is that your name"  "It is"  "Oh God Oh God Oh God  Hugh Little Hugh My boy My sweet boy"  Mr Elford was almost overcome In a moment he again cried"My saviour too Still the same Courageous humane generous All that my soul could desire Oh shield me deliver me from this excess of joy"  CHAP XVII THE CONCLUSION  ONE event only excepted little remains to be told of my story and that one is doubtless anticipated by the imagination of the reader To describe the enquiries that passed between me and my uncle the various fortunes we had encountered and the feelings they excited would be to write his history and tediously repeat my own My difficulties now disappeared I was the acknowledged heir of a man of great wealth therefore I myself am become a great man Heaven preserve  me from becoming indolent proud and oppressive I have not yet forgotten that oppression exists that pride is its chief counsellor that activity and usefulness are the sacred duties of both rich and poor that the wealth entrusted to my distribution is the property of those whom most it can benefit that I am a creature of very few wants but that those few in others as well as in myself are imperious and that I have felt them in all their rigour Neither have I yet shut my doors on one of my former friends But I am comparatively young in prosperity How long I shall be able to persevere in this eccentric conduct time must tell At present I must proceed and mention the few remaining circumstances with which the reader may wish to be acquainted  After my uncle had heard me describe Olivia and mention the motives which induced me to wish to aid her brother he immediately determined on taking the journey we had before proposed We  neither of us wished to separate Robust in "a green old age" he had no fear of fatigue from travelling this distance and it would be a pleasure to revisit in my company scenes which would bring my former sports and pranks to his recollection He heard from me a confirmation of the death of Mrs Elford and heard it with the same tokens of melancholy in his face which he had betrayed when he spoke of her himself  That I should have wished before I took this journey short as it was to have seen Olivia related all my good fortune and partaken in the pleasure it would excite in her may well be imagined but forms and delicacies and I know not what habitual feelings forbad me the enjoyment of this premature bliss I wrote however and not only to her but to those tried and invaluable friends who were not to be neglected  We found Hector in a lamentable state Instead of the bluff robust form  which but shortly before he had worn his limbs were shrunk his cheeks formerly of a high red were wan and hollow his voice was gone his lungs were affected and his cough was incessant He had himself at last begun to think his life in danger and was preparing to return to town for advice consequently our stay was short His reception of me however was friendly The increasing debility which he felt softened his manners and when he understood the good fortune that had befallen me he seemed sincerely to rejoice  And now let me request the reader to call to mind not only my first emotions of love for Olivia and the violence of the passion that preyed upon me while struggling between hope and despair but those late testimonies of affection such as a mind so dignified as hers could bestow and then let him imagine what our meeting must be Should he expect me to describe her such as the was  and is in all her attractions all her beauties and all her various excellence he expects an impossible task To be beloved by her to be found worthy of her and to call her mine are blessings that infinitely exceed momentary rapture they are lasting and indubitable happiness  I know not if it will give him pleasure to be told that could I have delighted in revenge I might have satiated myself with that unworthy and destructive passion The committee appointed to decide on the election voted the Idford candidate guilty of bribery and corruption The fortune of the Earl like that of Hector has suffered depredations which half a century will probably not repair The new made peer and his party daily became so obnoxious to the nation by the destructive tendency of their measures that they were and continue to be haunted by terrors that deprive them of the faculties common to man My heart  bears witness for me that I do not speak this in triumph I should be no less vicious than unworthy could I triumph in the misfortunes of any human being but I were a wretch indeed were I to make mistakes that are the scourge of mankind a subject of exultation  Must I repeat more names Is it necessary to say the virtues of Turl and Wilmot are too splendid to need my praise or that my social hours are most beneficially and delightfully spent in their society That I have amply provided for the generous minded Clarke That Philip is once more the good and faithful servant of a kind mistress That Mary and her son are equally objects of my attention And that I do not mean to boast of these things as acts of munificence but as the performance of duties  This were unnecessary Neither shall I be required to particularize the present happiness of Lydia now Mrs Wakefield and of that man of brilliant and astonishing  faculties who is her affectionate companion and friend and from whose exertions if I am not strangely mistaken the world has so much to profit and so much to expect Like me he is in the enjoyment of affluence and he enjoys it with a liberal and munificent spirit Are there any who hate him because he once was guilty of hateful crimes I hope not It is a spirit that would sweep away half the inhabitants of the "peopled earth" For my own part I delight in his conversation am enlivened by his wit and prompted to enquiry by the acuteness of his remarks He is a man whom I am proud to say I love  I have told my tale If it should afford instruction if it should inspire a love of virtue briefly if it should contribute to the happiness of mankind I shall have gained my purpose My labours will be most richly rewarded  THE END
