committing another  The first species of  Raphidiae  known was figured in the works of Roesel  Die Fleine Landhaelsige Lanlibelle fig    pl  it was described in the Fauna Suecica by Linnaeus under the specific name Ophiopsis and again in the  Systema Natura  of the same author with a reference to the only figure of it then extant that of Roesel Hence it appears that the true Raphidia Ophiopsis of Linnaeus is that figured by this author In later editions the works of Sulzer Schaeffer Geoffroy and Scopoli were added to the synonyms but the figures thus quoted evidently include two species one with wings perfectly clear the other having a marginal black spot on each Linnaeus seems to have considered the two as varieties of the same species but he is evidently mistaken for the two sexes of both kinds are now clearly ascertained  Fabricius has followed Linnaeus in his Species Insectorum has indiscriminately adopted all the synonyms and thereby confounded all the figures of the two Raphidae that have been noticed by authors on European Insects under the name of Ophiopsis and after this he describes that very species which has spots on the wings as a new and unfigured kind under the name of  notata  Thorace cylindrico alis macula marginali fusca Habitat in anglia Had he referred to the volumes of Roesel he must have known that his  notata  was the Linnaean Ophiopsis and if either Insect was new it must certainly be that destitute of spots  Gmelin in his Systema Natura perpetuates the same error he follows the Species Insectorum of Fabricius and gives the characters thus "R Ophiopsis alis immaculatis  Fab  "  R notata alis macula marginali fusca  Fab  but whilst the works of Gmelin are preparing for publication Fabricius alters his opinion and in the last work  Syst

in the middle of the anterior wings  PAPILIO IDAS alis integris fuscis fascia marginali utrinque rubro∣maculata anticis macula media nigra  This insect must not be confounded with the Papilio Idas of Linnaeus The Linnaean P Idas is evidently the female of P Argus a circumstance unknown to that author who considers them as a distinct species from their very dissimilar appearance In one sex the upper surface is brown and in the other a fine blue this is not however peculiar to the P Argus for several of the Papilio tribe known amongst English collectors by the trivial name  Blues  differ in the same manner  We suspect that our Insect has not been described by any author it is certainly unnoticed by Fabricius in his last System of Entomo∣logy and the specific name  Idas  omitted This name is therefore preferred for our Insect which seems to approach nearer to the female Argus described by Linnaeus as Idas than to any other Found in May  PLATE CCCXXIII SCARABAEUS LURIDUS  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae terminate in a club which is divided longitudinally into laminae or plates  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  AND  SYNONYMS  Scutellum thorax and head black Wingcases pale brown striated and

Roes Ins    tab    In the description of Phalaena Nupta we have offered some re∣marks on the Sponsa Nupta and Pacta of Linnaeus and Fabricius and have only to add in this place that an accurate figure of P Pacta is given in  Fuesl Archiv tab    fig  This figure is smaller than the species found in Great Britain and in particular has the upper surface of the abdomen crimson as authors have de∣scribed it  The Synonyms of the three species as they stand in the works of Linnaeus and Fabricius are very incorrect We venture to retain that to Roesel's plate vol t in which the larva we have figured is given  The Caterpillars feed on the tops of the highest Oaks change to the pupa state in June and appears a winged Insect early in the month following  LINNAEAN INDEX TO VOL IX  COLEOPTERA
