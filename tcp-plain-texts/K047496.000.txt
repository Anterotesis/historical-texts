the Year and having  both in that Expedition and in my Return by the Easternpart of the SouthSea and through the  Indian  Ocean remarked not only faithfully but with all the Accuracy I could whatever I conceived might be serviceable or instructive to such as should hereafter sail into those Parts I hope you will pardon my Presuption in laying my said Observations before you  I humbly take the Liberty to represent to you that I have launched forth into no Descriptions or particular Accounts of Things which the Course of my Voyage gave me not sufficient Opportunity to be  fully and perfectedly instructed in and I spared no Pains in the setting them down together with Draughts of such Places as I had time or convenience of taking and in all this I have not through any design of contradicting others or in hopes thereby to recommend my own Performance either opposed or slighted any good and true Observations which have already been made by those who have heretofore visited any of the same Places This I presume to mention with a particular regard to the most material of Captain  Dampier  's own Observations formerly published which I found by  Experience to be true But I hope I may without breach of Modesty declare that I have remarked several things both new and useful which the uncommon Course we steared and the unusual Accidents we met with gave me particular Opportunities to enquire into  Sir I am not pretending to a meritorious Claim of your Protection but am encourag'd to hope for it from your known Candour and Goodness And it is very natural to flatter our selves that Persons of your Judgment and Experience in Maritime Affairs will look with a more favourable Eye  even on our meanest Endeavours than those can be expected to do who know but little of those Matters and are apt to prefer superficial Accounts which are frequently very erroneous before the most useful though less diverting However it be if I can be so happy as to receive any countenance from your distinguishing Judgment or at least your Pardon for this my Boldness I shall not fear that any Opinion or Prejudice of less discerning Persons can discredit the Truth or Usefulness of my Observations  I am sensible Sir how little I ought to encroach upon  your Time which is so usefully and so diligently employed And therefore I humbly beg leave to conclude with subscribing my self  Your HONOURS most Dutiful most Obedient and most Humble Servant  William Funnell  THE PREFACE  THE Voyages and Descriptions formerly published by Captain  William Dampier  have met with so good Reception and universal Approbation in the World and there has been so general an Expectation of the Success of the present Expedition under the Command of a Person so perfectly acquainted with those Parts of the World to which we were  bound and so well skilled in the Trade Shipping Customs and Designs of the  Spaniards  against whom we were employed that I presume there needs no Apology for publishing the following Account  The Success indeed of our Expedition was not such as might at first have been expected from the Skill of our Commander and the Resolution of our Men Disagreements and Mismanagements having broken our Measures and defeated our most promising Hopes as they have often been Occasions of the miscarriage of the greatest and noblest Attempts  But though we failed in our chief Designs yet the great Variety of Accidents we met with and the many Discoveries we made and particular Accounts of the manner how our Attempts miscarried I hope cannot but be very acceptable to the inquisitive Reader  I have chosen not to be large in the Descriptions of Towns and Places of which others have already given us sufficient Accounts But the whole Western Coast of  America  from the Southend of  California  to the Port of  Valdivia  which is above sixty Degrees I have given one continued and much more particular  Description of than has ever yet been made publick and also I have given an exact Account of the Variation of the Compass upon the whole Coast And though it may perhaps by some be thought not so pleasant and entertaining as Descriptions of the Country within Land yet it cannot but be much more useful especially to such as shall hereafter sail into those Parts  And here I cannot in justice but take notice that upon all this Coast and during our whole stay in the South Seas we found Captain  Dampier  's Descriptions of Places very exact and his  Account of Winds Currents  c  very extraordinary  After our parting from Capt  Dampier  in the Gulf of  Amapalla  and running over to  India  we met as with many Hardships so also with some Variety of new Discoveries in our wandering among unknown SpiceIslands And particularly the Misfortunes which necessitated us to put in at  Amboyna  where we were detained Prisoners by the  Dutch  gave me an opportunity of making such Enquiries into the State Government Product Trade  c  of that Island  as I perswade my self will be very acceptable to the ingenious Reader  ERRATA  Pag  lin  read      watered      never      seven or eight      leagues  THE CONTENTS  CHAP I  The Design of

of that Island Of the Shark Of the Dolphin Of the JellyFish Of the OldWife Description of the Islands of St  Ann  Of the Boobie Of the Island  Le Grand  Of the SilverFish A strange Bird taken off the  Sibbel de Wards  Arrival at  Juan Fernando's  WE were at first Two Ships of Twentysix Guns and One hundred and twenty Men each designed  for the SouthSeas The one was named the St  George  Captain  William Dampier  Commander on Board of which I was and the other was named the  Fame John Pulling  Captain We were each of us supplied with all Warlike Stores and very well victualled for nine Months and had Commissions from his Royal Highness the Lord HighAdmiral to proceed in a Warlike manner against the  French  and  Spaniards  And we Both were upon the same Terms of no Purchase no Pay But whilst we were in the  Downs  there arising some Difference between the two Captains Captain  Pulling  in his Ship the  Fame  went away and left us intending as he said to go and cruize among the  CanaryIslands  and we never saw him after But before our going away from  Ireland  we were joyned by another Ship sent after us on purpose She was a small Ship named the  Cinqueports  Gally burthen about ninety Tuns sixteen Guns and sixty three Men  Charles Pickering  Captain Which Ship was also very well victualled and provided for the said Voyage Our Proposals were to go into the River of  Plate  to  Buonas Aires  to take two or three  Spanish  Galleons which Captain  Dampier  gives an account are usually there And if by that Expedition we got to the value of Pounds  then to return again without proceeding further But if we missed of Success there then to cruize upon the Coast of  Peru  for the  Valdivia  Ships which commonly are said to bring down store of Gold to  Lima  But if that Design should also fail then to attempt some rich Towns according as Captain  Dampier  should think fit And after that we were at the usual time of the Year to go down upon the Coast of  Mexico  to seek for a great Galleon which Trades from  Manila  one of the  Philippine  Islands to  Acapulco  on the Coast of  Mexico  and which is commonly reported to be worth thirteen or fourteen Millions of Pieces of Eight The Reason we did not go to  Buonas Aires  was because upon our arrival at  Madera  we had advice that the Galleons beforementioned were arrived at  Teneriff  The Success of our other Designs are set down particularly in the following Relation  On the  th  of  April  we sailed out of the  Downs  and on the  th  of  May  anchored at  Kingsale  in  Ireland  Here we refitted and victualled our Ship and were joined by another Ship named the  Cinqueports  burthen about ninety Tuns sixteen Guns and sixty three Men  Charles Pickering  Captain And on the th of  September  we in company of our Consort Captain  Pckering  left  Kingsale  and on the th we reached the Island of  Madera  where we did not anchor but lay off and on for our Boats which were sent ashore for some Necessaries By a good observation I make this Island to lye in the Latitude of d m  N  And Longitude by my account from  London W  d m It is a very pleasant Island inhabited by  Portugueze  it abounds in Corn Wine Honey Sugar Madder Oranges Lemons Pomegranets  c  Having done our Business here we departed  Sept  and on the th saw  Palma  and  Fero  the two Westermost of the  Canary  Islands they being in all seven so called from  Canaria  the Chief They are also called  Fortunate  from their Fruitfulness being plentiful in several sorts of Commodities but especially in the Wine called  Canary  brought from hence in abundance We did not stop here but made the best of our way for the  Cape de Verde  Islands and  October  the th saw the Island of  Mayo  lying in the Latitude of d m  N  and Longitude from  London W  d m The chief o  what this Island produces is Salt o  which here is plenty for fetching W  ay off and on all Night but could no  get off any because here ran so great a Surf that we durst not venture our Boats ashore So  October  the seventh in the Morning we bore away for the Island St  Jago  and at Noon anchored at  Prior Bay  This Bay lies in the Latitude of d m  N  and West from  London  d m  This is one of the Southermost and most fruitful of the  Cape de Verde  Islands it abounding in Hogs Fowls  Guinea  Hens Monkies Maiz Oranges Lemons Dates Watermelons Plantains Bonanoes  c  Here is good Water to be had but troublesome fetching of it and Wood is very dear by reason of its scarcity The Natives of this place were formerly  Portugueze  who were banished to this place for Murthers Thefts and other Villanies but now they are mostly black by reason of their Converse amongst their Womenslaves which are  Guinea Negroes  And although they have changed their Colour yet they still retain their Vices thieving being commoner here than in any place I have been in insomuch that they will take your Hat off your Head at Noonday although you be in the midst of Company You must also be very wary how you Trade with them for if you let them have  your  Goods before you have  theirs  you will  be sure to lose them At this place we was ter'd our Ship and refresh'd our selves and here being some Disagreement between our Captain and first Lieutenant our Captain turned him ashore with his Chest and and Cloaths and Servant much against both their Wills about twelve at Night At four the next Morning it being the th of  October  we parted from the said Island not fully resolved what place to touch at next On  October  the d being in the Latitude of d m  N  and Longitude from  London W  about d m we caught four Fish a Shark a Dolphin a Jellyfish and an Oldwife  The  Shark  See FIG I  is a very ravenous sort of Fish Those that we catch at Sea are commonly about five or six Feet in length they have a great wide Mo  h with three and sometimes four rows of Teeth very sharp and jagged like a Sawe It is so fierce a Fish that when it wants its Prey it will seize upon any thing and make nothing of taking off a Man's Leg at a bite or two He hath two Stones between his Eyes which are accounted very good if taken inwardly by any one that has the Stone or Gravel These Stones we commonly take out and give to our Doctor who makes use of them as he finds occasion When they are taken out of the Head  depiction of shark  Fig  A  Shark  drawn on his back being the posture he is in when he takes his prey his mouth not appearing in any other posture  depiction of dolphins  Fig  Dolphins  they are a perfect Jelly but being laid in the Sun and dryed they look like damp Chalk The Shark is usually attended with one two three or more small Fish about the bigness of an ordinary Whiting which go before him and show him his Prey They are called Pylotfish and look very pretty in the Water they will play about him be he never so hungry and he never offers to prey upon them  The  Dolphin  See FIG II  is between four and five feet in length some more some less It is a very pretty coloured Fish and very good to eat but something dry They feed mostly upon Flyingfish a sort of Fish about the bigness of an ordinary Herring and much like one the  Dolphins  are so nimble as to catch them when they light in the Water to wet their Wings or rather Fins For they can fly no longer than their Wings are wet but then fall into the Water and mount again It is very pretty to see what shifts and turns they will make to get clear of their great Enemy the Dolphin and rather than be taken by them they will often fly into a ship but when they are in unless they happen to fall into a puddle of Water they cannot fly out again for want of moisture in their Wings  The  Jellyfish  See Fig III  was about fourteen Inches long and about Inches deep with a very sharp set of Teeth a very curious sparkling Eye a long extended Mouth a monstrous high Fin on his Back being of a slimy substance only the Ribs which stretched it out being thirty two in number were firm and stiff He had one small Fin under his Jaw of the same slimy Substance That part of him which is without small spots is a perfect green  Jelly  whence he was called by us a  Jellyfish  The rest of him was firm of a Silver colour with small spots and streaks or partings as is exprest in the  Figure  The  Oldwife  See Fig IV  was a Fish about two foot long and Inches high He hath a small Mouth a large Eye a great Fin on his back beginning at the hinder part of his Head and stretching to his Tail he hath a large broad Fin on each side near the Gills with one pretty large one under his Belly his Body is of a deep Blue and his Fins of a very light Blue the ends of which are Yellow His Body and Head have a great many spots and cross streaks or partings as is exprest in the  Fig  There is also another sort of  Oldwife  such as is described by Captain  Dampier  in his third Volume  On  November    d  we crossed the Equator about forty five Leagues to the  depiction of jelly fish  Fig

we saw abundance of Flyingfish We now found our selves in the S E Tradewind and met with but little Rains Tornadoes Thunder or Lightning to the Northward of the Line  On  November    th  in the evening we observed by A Z  th  compass and found the Variation by a good amplitude to be d m Easterly Latitude by Observation S d m and Longitude  West  from the Island St  Jago  d m  November    th  in the morning we observed again by A Z  th  compass and found Variation by the Medium of A Z  ths  to be d m Easterly Latitude by Observation S d m Longitude from  London West  d m  November    th  we found the variation to be d m E Latitude by Observation S d m Longitude from  London  W d m This day fourteen or fifteen of our people fell ill of a Fever  November  we anchored at the Islands St  Anns  which by my account lie in the Latitude of d m Longitude W from  London  d m and we reckon here about d Easterly Variation We went ashoar here intending to wood and water but could find no Water so we cut a Longboatload of Wood and came on board again and got up our Anchors intending to wood and water at the I  land  Le Grand  There are three of the Islands called by the name of St  Anns  not above a Stones cast from each other they are very full of Wood as is all the  Brasilian  Coast These Islands are distant from the Main about four Miles This place is very much troubled with Southerly Winds which blow extraordinarily in gusts therefore the only way is to lay your best Anchor to the Southward and all little enough sometimes The Islands produce nothing but Wood and have a vast many Seafowl upon them by Sailours called  Boobies  See a draught of the three Islands of St  Anns  See Fig V  The  Booby  See Fig VI  is much about the bigness of a Duck some are quite White some Grey They have Feet like a Duck being a Waterfoul They feed mostly upon Flyingfish which they catch Flying I have made many a Meal of this sort of Birds but it was for want of other Victuals They taste very Fishy and if you do not salt them very well before you eat them they will make you sick They are so silly that when they are weary of flying they will if you hold out your Hand come and sit upon it From thence I conjecture that they are called  Boobies  November    th  we anchored at the Island  Le Grand  whose Latitude is d m S Longitude from  London  W d m and found here about d E Variation

The soil is black and the Island is about nine Leagues round and distant from the Main about three Miles It is not inhabited by any other than Jaccals Lyons Tygers  c  Which in the Night make a most hideous Noise enough to terrifie any Man About three Miles from this place is the main Land all very mountainous and woody where is a small Town of the  Portugueze  called by the name of  Le Grand  Town who come out of the Country for forty or fifty Miles round on Saint  Andrews  day to pay their Devotions to that Saint here being a small Church consecrated to his use They abide here about fourteen Days and then return to their own Dwellings Here is Rum Sugar and several sorts of Indian Fruits to be had but very dear by reason of their supplying the Town of St  Pauls  with these Necessaries near which Town is said to be a Goldmine accounted one of the richest yet known It is distant from the Town of  Le Grand  about three hundred Miles and is reckoned by reason of the difficulty of the way and the vast high Mountains that intercept the passage to be sixty days journey At this place we wooded watered and refitted our Ship Here our first Lieutenant with eight of  our Men our Captain and they falling out went ashoar with their Goods and left us Here also  Charles Pickering  Captain of the  Cinqueports  our Consort another main Pillar of our Voyage departed this Life and his Body was buried ashoar at the Wateringplace with the usual Ceremony of firing of Guns and Mr  Tho Stradling  his Lieutenant took command of his Ship Here is good fishing with the Saine Fish being very plentiful and of various sorts as the  Silverfish  and several others  The  Silverfish  See Fig VIII  is about twenty Inches long in height from the top of his Head to the bottom of his Belly eight Inches he hath five small Fins on the hinderpart of his Head and one large one reaching from the hindermost of the five small ones to the Tail He has two midling ones one on each side near the Gills and one large one stretching from the middle of the bottom of his Belly to his Tail which is halfmooned He has a large Eye a wide pair of Nostrils and a small Mouth It is a very thin Fish and very bony He is of a fine transparent White and thence called by us a  Silverfish  December  the th having done our Business here we departed together with our Consort Captain  Stradling  not intending to touch any where till our arrival at the  depiction of silver fish  Fig  A Silver Fish  depiction of ducklike seabird  Fig  depiction of island of Juan Ferdenandos  Fig  The Island of

Easterly Latitude d m  S  Longitude from  London W  d m  December  the th betimes in the Morning we saw the Islands of  Sibbil de Wards  which are three in Number lying in the Latitude of d m  S  Longitude  W  from  London  by my account d m and had a good Observation by AZ  th  Compass and found Variation to be d m Easterly Captain  Dampier  in his  Voyage round the World  computes the Longitude of these Islands West from the  Lizard  to be d m The occasion of which difference I suppose to be his having made longer Runs in that Voyage and so more liable to mistakes of this Nature Whether there be any Water upon these Islands I know not but never did hear of any From the time of our passing the Latitude of d  S  we saw a great many Birds about the Ship And when we were off the  Sibbil de Ward  Islands we took one remarkable Bird which we  suppose came from those Islands It was about the bigness of a Duck and of a very fine white colour  See Fig IX  His Bill was yellow and both above and below the Bill were long grey hairs like whiskers And instead of Feathers at the bottom of his Eyelids he had short stiff hairs which were black We did not stop at these Islands but kept on our way for the Southseas  January    th  being in the Latitude of d m  S  we met with a very hard storm of Wind at  S W  in which storm we lost Company of our consort but hoped to find him again at  Juan Fernandoes  that being the appointed place of Rendezvous  January  the  th  we found the Variation by a good Amplitude to be d m Easterly Latitude by a good Observation  S  d m Longitude from London  West  d m  January    th  Captain  Dampier  thinking we were to the Westward of  Cape Horn  ordered to put the ship about We had then the Wind at  W S W  and stood away South but tacking we stood away to the Northward and at noon had Latitude by Observation  S  d m and made Longitude from  London W  d m  January    th  betimes in the morning we saw Land contrary to all our expectations which proved to be four Islands lying about five Leagues to the Eastward  of the Island  Terra Del Fuego  or the Land of Fire so called by the  Spaniards  the first discoverers of it

Spaniards  or with any white Men for they think all white Men are  Spaniards  It is a high Island four Leagues in length and has many Shoals on the West side which run a League or more into the Sea It is distant from the Port of  Valdivia  Leagues Northward and from the River  Imperial  N N W  February  the th we observed by AZ  th  Compass and found Variation by Amplitude to be d m Easterly

passing by the great  Bay we saw our Consort Capt  Stradling  in the  Cinqueports  who had been arrived three Days before so we anchored in the little Bay in twelve Fathom Water oazy Ground but finding it not convenient lying here we weigh'd and went to the great Bay where we anchored in Fathom Water and found Variation to be d m Easterly Latit of the Bay is d m S  See Fig X  CHAP II

endeavours of Captain  Dampier  they were again reconciled and returned aboard their own Ship again  This Island is so called from the first Discoverer of it who was a  Spaniard  named  Juan  or  John Fernando  It is about fourteen Leagues round full of high Hills and small pleasant Valleys The Woods afford several sorts of Trees but none fit for Masts Here are  Pamento  Trees in abundance but the Spice was not ripe whilst we were here Also abundance of  Cabbagetrees  altho small yet very good and sweet  The Cabbagetree  See Fig XI  is of Body small and streight with several Knots or Joynts about four Inches from each other like a BamboeCane void of any Leaves except at the top in the midst of which the Cabbage is contained which when boiled is as good as any GardenCabbage I ever tasted The Branches are commonly about twelve or thirteen Feet in length and about a foot and an half from the Trunk of the Tree they shoot forth Leaves about four foot long and an Inch and a half broad These Leaves grow so regularly that the whole Branch seems but one entire Leaf The Cabbage when it is cut out from amongst the bottoms of the  depiction of Cabbage Tree  g  The Cabbage Tree  with its

Gallo  Thus appears the Island Gallo bearing N diss  e  or Leagues The hummocks at this diss  e  looking like Islands  Branches is commonly about six Inches about and a foot long some more some less and is as white as Milk At the bottom of the Cabbage grow great Bunches of Berries of about six pound weight in the shape of a bunch of Grapes Their Colour is red like a Cherry and the Berries are about the bigness of a black Cherry with a large Stone in the middle and they taste much like  English  Haws We never climb up to get the Fruit or Cabbage because the Tree is so high and there is not any thing to hold by so that a Man would find it a hard matter to get up For I have seen some of these Trees after we we have cut them down which we always do to get the Cabbage to be ninety or a hundred Feet in length  There are in this Island a great many  WildCats  of the finest Colour I ever saw which were put ashoar here as I suppose by the  Spaniards  to destroy the Goats But their Project has not taken effect for here are vast numbers of  Goals  The old ones both Male and Female take turns to guard their Young so that the Cats durst not venture upon the Young the old ones being always their Guard I wonder the  Spaniards  should think that by setting Cats ashoar here they should destroy the Goats when at the same time there are such vast numbers of  Seales  both young  and old on whom the Cats may more easily prey because they cannot so well defend their young as the Goats do I have heard of mad Dogs being put ashoar here by the  Spaniards  for the same intent but never saw any Yet if they were I am apt to believe they would rather prey upon the Seals than the Goats  Of  Goats  as I said before here is great plenty and especially towards the West part of the Island they resort thither by reason there is better Pasture for them Of these Goats we used to get store and a Joint of one of them roasted with about half a foot of our Cabbage boiled makes a very good Meal I have heard Captain  Martin  tell of some  French  Pirates who were in these Seas that having been sometime cruizing up and down and no  meeting with a sufficient Booty and being every where discovered by the  Spaniards  and out of hopes of getting any more they concluded to come to this Island o  Juan Fernando's  they being twenty in number and there to lie nine or ten Months which accordingly they did and landed on the West side of the Island▪ then drew there little Armadilla ashoar and in a small time brought the Goats t  be so tame as that they would many o  them come of themselves to be milked▪ of which Milk they made good Butter an  Cheese not only just to supply their Wants whilst they were upon the Island but also to serve them long after and that after they had continued here ten Months they launched their little Man of War went upon the Coast of  Peru  and off the Bay of  Arica  met with a  Spanish  Ship and took her in which was said to be two hundred thousand Pieces of Eight with about the value of half as much more in gold double Doubloons  Birds here are few or none of Note except the  HummingBird  which is about the bigness of a Bee It hath a Bill no bigger than an ordinary Pin his Legs are small but in proportion to his Bulk his Feathers are very small and mostly black We seldom used to catch or see these Birds unless toward Evening and then they would come humming about us But if it was dark and we had a Fire before Morning we should have a hundred of them fly into the Fire  Of the Sea Inhabitants here are  Seals  in such abundance that without driving them away there is no going ashoar Here are also a great many  SeaLyons  and for Cavallies Silverfish Groopers Breams and Crawfish here is such great plenty that it is almost incredible  The SeaLyon is so called as I conjecture because his roaring is not unlike  that of the Lyon the Head likewise much resembles the Lyon He hath four large Teeth before the rest thick short and stubbed In this he is like the Lyon in all other parts quite different He hath four Fins the two foremost serve him when he goes ashoar to raise the forepart of his Body and then he draws the hinderpart after him the two hinder Fins are of no use to him on Land but only in the Water These Creatures are very fat for which reason we kill'd several of them and soon made us a Tun of Oil for our Lamps although most of us whilst we were here made use of it in frying of Fish and indeed it had no unpleasant taste We killed one which was twenty three Feet in length fourteen foot and a half round and cut seventeen Inches deep in fat They have short Hair of a light Colour but lighter when young than old For when old they look more sandy Their Food is Fish for their prey is all in the Water though they generally come on Land to sleep and then five six or seven of them will huddle together like Swine and lie so three or four Days if not molested They are very much afraid of a Man and so soon as they see him any thing near they will make to the Water for they never go far from it If they are hard pursued they will turn about and  raise their Body up with their Forefins and face you standing with their Mouth wide open upon their Guard So that when we wanted to kill one to make Oil we used commonly to clap a Pistol just to his Mouth as it stood open and fire it down his Throat But if we had a mind to have some Sport with him which we called Lyonbaiting usually six seven or eight or more of us would go with each a half Pike in his Hand and so prick him to Death which commonly would be a Sport for two or three Hours before we could conquer him And often times he would find us work enough But he being an unweildy Creature and we assaulting him both behind before and all round we must needs conquer Yet he often put us to the run and sometimes he would run himself but knew not which way for we commonly got beeween the Water and him  The  Seals  are much of the same kind only their Heads are like a Hounds They howl like Dogs when old and bark like them when young They have a very fine Furr the finest next the Sable I ever saw Some of them are of a bright Silvercolour some of a Chestnut They feed as the Sealion being Both amphibious Creatures and sleep like them only when they go their hinder as well as forefins  are of use to them They are about the bigness of a large Mastiff They are very fat but not the best Victuals When they come out of the Sea they bleat like Sheep for their Young which though they are to pass through Thousands both young and old yet will find out their own Damm to suck For none of them will suffer any Young to suck them but only their own Both young and old love much to lie ashoar but when beaten by us they make to the Sea and a small blow on the Nose soon kills them I have eaten of these Seals often but it was to save better Victuals however they eat tolerably well to those that are very hungry and have no other Meat The Lean of the Flesh is black and of a course Grain  The  Silverfish  here  See Fig XII  is quite different from those at  Brasil  both in shape and substance This having but six Fins  viz  four large ones two upon his Back and two opposite under his Belly and one small one on each side near his Gills It hath a small Eye and a great Bottlenose It is a very fleshy Fish and the Flesh is extraordinary white and good they are commonly about twelve or thirteen Inches long and about seven Inches deep with a halfmooned Tail as is expressed in the Figure  February  the th at Noon we saw a Sail So we got on board all our People got up our Yards and Topmasts and he being pretty near we clapt our LongBoat on our Moorings let slip and got under sail He seeing us get under sail tackt and stood from us and we made the best of our way after him and our Consort made what haste he could after us and about eleven at Night we came close up with him but did not think convenient to engage till Day In this chace our Pinnace towed under Water so we cut her loose Captain  Stradling  's Boat also broke loose and in her was a Man and a Dog At Sunrise the next Morning being  March  the st we began to engage the said Ship which was a  French  Ship of about four hundred Tuns and thirty Guns wellmann'd We fought her very close broadside and broadside for seven Hours and then a small Gale springing up she shear'd off As for our Consort he fir'd about ten or twelve Guns and then fell a Stern and never came up again during the Fight We had nine of our Men killed in the Fight and several wounded We were desirous to have the other Tryal with him knowing it would be of dangerous Consequence to let him go for if we did we were sure he would discover us to the  Spaniards  which would  be of ill Consequence to our whole Proceedings But our Captain was against it saying that at the worst if the  Spaniards  should know of our being in those Seas and so should hinder their Merchantships from coming out yet that he knew where to go and could not fail of taking to the value of  l  any Day in the Year Upon this we lay by for our Consort who soon came up And it was quickly agreed between the two Captains to let her go So the Enemy stood from us I suppose very well satisfied that he had disappointed us both And we were very much dissatisfied that we should suffer our selves to be so baffled in our first Attempt But however since it was so we concluded to return to  Juan Fernando  's to get our Anchors Cables Longboats and several Tun of Water casked with a Tun of SeaLions Oyl which we had left there And Captain  Stradling  had left five of his Men who were gone to the West part of the Island and knew nothing of our going out after the Enemy He had also left behind him all his Sails except those at the Yards with a great many other Stores Accordingly we stood away towards the said Island and on the d saw the Island bearing South distant about nine or ten Leagues We had then the Wind at South right off the Land so that we found it  very difficult to get up with it But it falling calm the  Cinqueports  put out her Oars and rowed towards the Island Presently after which we saw two Sail The  Cinqueports  was pretty near them and they fired at her several shots but she rowed away to us and gave us an account that they were two  French  Ships each of about thirty six Guns So the two Captains thought it convenient not to go in but to go away for the Coast of  Peru  leaving behind Capt  Stradling  's five Men with other Necessaries that we could ill spare For now we had neither of us any Boats However according to their Agreement on  March  the th we stood away for the Coast of  Peru  and on the th fell in with the Land it being very high three rows of Hills one within another that towards the Water lowest and that towards the Land highest We were then in the Latitude of d m S From thence we coasted along shore to the Northward and on the th past by the Port of  Copiapo  whose Latitude is d m S We observed here and found the Variation by AZ  th  Compass to be d m Easterly  This is said to be a very good Port and to be fenced from almost all Winds Near to the Port are four or five Rocks and within Land it is inhahited by  Indians  who  make good Wine Here is said also to be good Meat Corn and other Necessaries In this Port they load Wine Money and other Goods for  Coquimbo  We would very willingly have gone ashoar here to have got some Refreshment but could not for want of Boats The Land continues to be very high and mountainous so that I think it is the highest Land I ever saw We kept still cruizing down along shore  The th Instant our Men being all at Dinner and our Ship about ten Leagues off Shore going with a fine fresh Gale of Wind at East we were suddenly surprized with the change of the Colour of the Water which looked as red as Blood to as great a distance as we could see which might be about seven or eight Leagues At first we were mightily surprized but recollecting our selves we sounded but had no Ground at one hundred and seventy Fathom We then drew some Water up in Buckets and poured some into a Glass It still continued to look very red till about a quarter of an Hour after it had been in the Glass when all the red Substance floated at top and the Water underneath was as clear as usual The red which floated at top was of a slimy Substance with little Knobs and we all concluded it could be nothing but the Spawn  of Fish VVe were now in the Latitude of d m South and had Variation d m Easterly having past by three noted Ports  viz Arica Ylo  and  Attiquipa  The Port of  Arica  is in the Latitude of d m S Longitude from  London  by my Account  W  d m and just off it we found d m Easterly Variation This Port of  Arica  is a very good Port and it is the Embarcado to most of the MineTowns of  Peru  It is a place of vast Trade and extraordinarily wellpeopled It is said to be seldom without Shipping altho' we saw none there at our passing by On the South side of the Harbour is a pretty Town situated on each side of a River called after the name of the Town of  Arica  and near the Town is a great Mountain called the Mountain of  Arica  under which the Shipping commonly lie in eight fathom Water And at the other end of the Bay is another Mountain called the Mountain of  Sama  under which Mountain are four whitish Cliffs And between the two Mounts of  Sama  and  Arica  are three Rivers The Northermost is called the River of  Sama  the middlemost the River of  John Deus  And as I said before the other the River of  Arica  on the Banks of which the said Town is situated  See Fig XIII  As we past by I took a Draught  of the Harbour As for  Ylo  and  Attiquipa  I shall say little of them till I come to speak of them in my Description of the Coast of  Chili Peru  and  Mexico  From the Latitude of d m S where we met the red Water we kept still standing away to the Northward And on the d of  March  found our selves just off  Lima  the Capital City of the two great Empires of  Peru  and  Chili  Here we furled all our Sails to our MainSail because we would not be seen by the  Spaniards  and laid our Ship by intending to watch all Ships going in or out At five in the Morning we made Sail again and before we were aware had like to have been upon the Rocks of  Ormigas  These Rocks are distant from the Island  Calan  which is the Port for  Lima  about eight Leagues and they bear from each other S S E and N N W They are large Rocks and in the middle of them are some Bays about which is said to be abundance of good Fish so that the Fishermen come to these Rocks a fishing Here They likewise make abundance of SeafishOil Having narrowly escaped these Rocks we stood away to the Northward and soon descryed two Sail We presently made a clear Ship and gave chase and soon came up with the sternmost she proved to be the Ship we fought with off the Island  Juan  Fernando's  and was now just off the Port of  Lima  into which she was bound to trade We were very eager to stop her going in for if we could it would hinder the  Spaniards  from having Intelligence of us Besides we did not question the taking of her because now our Men were all in Health whereas when we fought her before we had between twenty and thirty Men very sick and weak but being willing to show themselves they had done what good they could We knew also if we took her that she must needs prove a good Prize And her Guns Ammunition and Provisions would have been very welcome to us So we concluded to engage her our selves and to send Captain  Stradling  after the other which seemed not so big But our Captain thought it not advisable to venture upon her And whilst the Matter was disputing the two Ships got into  Lima  from whence I question whether twenty such Ships as ours could have forced them out  Being therefore very much discontented we again stood along shore to the Northward and the next Day in the Morning being  March  the th we saw a Sail which we gave chase to and came up with her and took her without any resistance She  proved to be a  Spanish  Ship of about Tuns laden as far as we could perceive with Snuff  Flanders  Lace VVoollenCloth wrought and unwrought Silk Pitch Tar Tobacco Turtleshell Beeswax Soap Cinamon  Jamaica  Pepper Jars of Balsom of  Peru  a few Planks and a pretty good Sum of Money We kept her with us till  March  the th and then having taken out a little of every thing our Captain discharged her alledging that if we kept her it would be a hindrance to his greater Designs We were forced to be as well content as we could So they stood for  Lima  whereunto they were bound and we stood along shore to the Northward and the next Morning by break of Day we found our selves just aboard of a strange Ship which we soon took not firing above Guns She was a new Ship of about two hundred Tuns and sailed very well considering her built She was laden with several very good Commodities as Indico Cochineel  c  We were now just off the Port of  Paita  whose Latitude is d m South its Longitude from  London  I reckon to be VVest d m and we found Variation by a good Amplitude just off the Harbour d m VVesterly A further Description of the Coasts I took a Draught as we lay off the Harbour  but not seeing any Ships we did not go in but still coasted away to the Northward On the th of  April  this second Prize after we had taken out a few odd Things was contrary to most of our Minds dismist the Captain alledging that he would not cumber up his Ship for that he intended to make a Voyage at one stroke upon some rich Town on which he had a speedy Design  On the fifth of  April  we began to prepare for our intended Action our Carpenters fixing our two Launches or  Spanish  LongBoats with two Patereroes to each Launch On the th being just in sight of the Island  Gallo  which at a distance looks like three Islands we saw a Sail came up with her and soon took her She was a Bark of about fifty Tuns laden with Plank and had a considerable quantity of Turtleshell on board At first sight of us their Men had all took to their Boat and got ashore This Bark our Captain intended to keep for the design in Hand and the next Day being  April  the th we anchored at the Island  Gallo  See Fig XIV  whose Latitude is d m Northward Longitude from  London  W d m and we found Variation d Westerly  It is distant from the Main about five Leagues It is in length about two  Leagues in breadth one This is a very noted Island When you are to the Southward of it it appears in three Hummocks which at a distance look like three Islands and the Land between each Hummock is very low But when you are to the N W of it at the South end you will see a small Island or rather Rock which looks very much like a Ship under sail And when you are at the North end you will so open the Land as that you will see part of it does not join to the Island as it seems to do when you are to the VVestward of it At the N E end of this Island are three small Islands or rather Rocks the one of which is pretty high and at a distance looks like a Barn and the other two look like two Sail of Ships At this Island you may see the main Land which is very low near the VVaterside but prodigious high up into the Country Here we anchored in thirty five Fathom Water two Cables length from the shore hard Sand We anchored in the N W part of the Island the Northermost Point bearing N half W Southermost Point S W The Wateringplace goes in with a small Gap over which upon the Hill is a plain Spot of red Earth bearing N W half N Though there are also several other good VVateringplaces upon this Island And in the N E part at  Segnetta  is the best anchoring Here  you may wood and water very secure from any Enemy and if occasion be you may hale your Ship ashore and clean her For it is very good Sandy Ground and the Water at Springtides rises and falls fourteen or fifteen foot The Island is very woody affording large Timber which is often sent in shipping up to the Coast of  Peru  Here are some few wild Monkies with abundance of Lizards and a large sort of Lizard called a LionLizard  They are about the bigness of a Man's Arm I measured one which from the Head to the end of the Tail was three foot eleven Inches He has a large sort of a Comb upon his Head which stands up like a Helmet or Headpiece to defend his Head When he is assaulted or frightned he sets his Comb up an end but otherwise it lies down flat in a deep Dent in his Head just fitted to it so that when it is down it can hardly be perceived He has two very large Eyes a large Mouth with a great many fine small sharp Teeth His Skin is very tough of a sad Colour full of black yellow and blueish Spots In all other things he resembles the common Lizard When they are pursued they will run very swift yet our Dog used often to catch them About six Leagues to the S S W of this Island is a small Island or rather Rock called  Gorgonilla  and not far of is the Island  Tumaco  Hereabouts upon the Main are a great many Rivers which make the Currents very uncertain about this Island  On  April  the th having lain here five Days just as we were going to get up our Anchors we saw a Sail standin for the Island So we lay still till she was pretty near in and then we all three got under Sail  viz  our selves the  Cinqueports  and a small  Spanish  Bark whom we took six Days before She stood boldly to us and we soon contrary to their expectation made a Prize of them They were going for the River  Tumaco  to get some Provisions there but as they past by seeing us and not hearing of an Enemy's being in the Seas but thinking us to be  Spaniards  they made towards us being in hopes to get some Provisions of us for their Money but on the contrary they lost both themselves their Vessel and Money She was a small Vessel of about fifty Tuns in her Balast commanded by an half  Indian  They had on Board a  Guernsey  Man whose Name I have forgot He was taken in the Bay of  Campeachy  having strayed from his Companions cutting of Logwood He was sent Prisoner to  Mexico  where after he had been imprisoned for two Years upon his turning Roman Catholick he was at liberty either  to stay in  Mexico  or to go aboard any Ship belonging to the  Spaniards  in the South Seas But they would not let him come any nearer the North Sea for fear he should make his escape So he being a Seafaring Man thought it most convenient to go on board some Ship where we found him He was very glad he was released from the  Spaniards  for had we not met with him he must probably have continued there all Days of his Life  CHAP III  Departure from  Gallo  Design upon the Town

enough because it is the first place that they send all the Gold to which they dig out of Mines not far from  Santa Maria  The last Vessel we took sailing very heavy and knowing it would be a hinderance to our design we sunk her The Captain of her after some fair Promises that we would give him a better and that if we succeeded in our attempt on the Town of  Santa Maria  we would satisfie him otherwise to his Hearts Content promised he would be our Pilot up to  Santa Maria  So preparing for our intended Enterprize we sailed along shore to the Northward and in our way passed by Cape  Corrientes  and several other noted places  This Cape  Corrientes  lies in the Latitude of d N It is a very high Land and when you are at Sea it looks like an Island by reason the Land near it at the Sea side is not so high On the top of the Capeland are three Hillocks It is a very good Coast and clear from Rocks and Shoals and almost steep From hence we proceeded on for Point  Garachina  Since we left the Island of  Gallo  we had fine fresh Gales of Wind commonly at S W and S S W On the th of  April  having past by several good Ports as Port  Santa Clara  Port  Quemado  Port  Pinas  and several others of which I shall speak in my Description of the Coasts we anchored at Point  Garachina  in eighteen Fathom Water claiey Ground distant from the Point two Miles  I make this Point of  Garachina  See Fig XV  to lie in the Latitude of d m N and distant from Port  Pinas  seven Leagues and from the Island  Gallera  six Leagues N W You may sail very well between the Island  Gallera  and the Main but have a great care of a shoal of Sand which lies middway and on which many good Ships have been lost But it is something dangerous to sail between the Island  Gallera  and the  Kings Islands  for there are many Rocks and if the Water should abate you must of necessity return to Point  Garachina  Point  Garachina  makes the South Point of the Gulf of St  Michael  as Cape St  Laurenzo  makes the North  Into this Gulf we were bound So having laid here two Days on the th one hundred and two of our Men with Captain  Dampier  and Captain  Stradling  in our Bark with three  Spanish  Launches went from our Ships which we left at Point  Garachina  with sixty Men to guard them with positive Orders not to remove from the place where we left them till our return and we proceeded on our intended Expedition for  Santa Maria  At eight at Night we anchored  depiction of Point Garachina  Fig  oint Garachina Lat North  Thus Showeth point Garachina bearing N dist Leagues

that we could not go against it Here we lay all Night having dark rainy Weather with much Thunder and Lightning so that we were all very wet and had a most uncomfortable Night for we were forced to lie in all the Rain having no shelter either in our little Bark or Boats By Daylight the next Morning as we lay at anchor the Tide of Ebb not being done a Canoa with five  Indians  came within call of us They hal'd us and ask'd from whence we came Our  Indian  Pilot by the Captain's Directions made answer that we came from  Panama  He bid them come on board but they answer'd they would not So our Captain ordered them to be fired at which accordingly was done Whereupon they made what haste they could from us One of our Lanches was sent after her but in vain for they soon got from us This was of ill consequence for we were sure they would discover us to the  Spaniards  at  Santa Maria  who we knew if they heard of an Enemy so near them would not only lay Ambuscades to annoy us going up the River but which was worst of all would carry all that was valuable out of the Town So two of our Lanches were immediately sent away with twenty two Hands each Captain  Stradling  commanding them with the  Indian  Pilot to take the Town of  Schuchadero  And Captain  Dampier  and we in the Bark were to follow as soon as the Tide served Just as our two Lanches entered the River of  Santa Maria  they saw a Canoa with three  Indians  come out of the River  Congo  Whereupon our Men put in behind a Point of Land in the River just by the entrance so that the  Indians  in the Canoa not having seen them were upon them before they suspected any thing and our Men immediately step'd out and seiz'd them It growing now towards Even they took one of the Prisoners into the Lanch and sent the other two in the Canoa with five of our Men to seek the Town of  Schuchadero  which our Captain told them was on the Northside of the River and about three Leagues within the Mouth But it being dark they could not find it However they heard the barking of a great many Dogs on the other side the River whence concluding there must be some Town they immediately put over for the other side As soon as they approached near the Town the two  Indians  which were in the Canoa with our five Men for the Outscout jumped overboard and we lost them Immediately one of our Men in the Canoa snatched up his Gun and fir'd at one of the  Indians  Whether  he shot him or no we cannot tell but as soon as he had fired there was another Gun fired from the Shoar Upon which our Men fired a Volley and landed and went to the Town which stood near the waterside and took it without any resistance all the people being fled at our first Gun firing knowing they were not strong enough to resist us For no doubt they had Intelligence by the Canoa which escap'd us at the Rivers Mouth In the Town our Men found abundance of Fowls Maiz Beans Yams Potatoes  c  but little else The next Morning being  April  the th Captain  Stradling  sent the Canoa to see for  Ʋs  in the Bark For after they were gone to take the Town as soon as the Tide of Flood began we got under sail intending to be soon after them But mistaking the Riversmouth we ran past it and not finding any other way to go in we came to an anchor and so were forced to lie all Night and the next Day till Noon the time of the Seabreeze at which time we met a Canoa coming out which at first we suspected to be Enemies but found they were our own Men who gave us an account of the taking of the  Indian  Town aforesaid and that in the Canoa they took a Pacquet of Letters The Letters were immediately opened and in them was found as follows  From the President of  Panama  to the Governour of the Town of  Santa Maria That  this was to let him know he had advice that two hundred and fifty  English  from  Jamaica  had landed on the Northside of the  Isthmus  and had a design upon the said Town of  Santa Maria  and that it was seven Days since he had sent four hundred Soldiers to reinforce them at  Santa Maria  and that he did not question but by the time he received the Letters they would be with him  That  he would have him always keep himself upon his Guard till this Advice was either disproved or confirmed  By that time we had read this Pacquet we were up as high as the Town that we took which we called  Schuchadero  there being another of the same Name on the Northside against it and came to an anchor just in four fathom Water The next Day in the Afternoon which was  April  the th Captain  Dampier  and Captain  Stradling  with three Launches and the Canoa with eighty seven of our Men proceeded for  Santa Maria  And our chief Mate and my self with thirteen Hands were left to guard the Bark with Orders not to stir from the place where we lay till our Mens return which was soon afterwards For about twelve this Night they returned on board frustrated of their Design Our Men gave us an account that they were up within a quarter of a Mile of the Town that they  were assaulted by three Ambuscades in which one of our Men was killed and several wounded that our Men beat them from their Ambuscades and would willingly have put ashoar but Captain  Dampier  advis'd that since the  Spaniards  knew of our coming and had had so much time as to provide Ambuscades for us it could not be doubted but they had made the best use of their time and had taken care to convey their Wives and Children and all that was valuable out of the Town which is always the first thing they do when they hear of an Enemy So it was resolved to return to us at  Schuchadero  And on  May  the  st  betimes in the Morning we left  Schuchadero  and went down the River in order to return on board our Ships which we left at Anchor at Point  Garachina  At our return on board  May  the  th  we were so scant of Provisions that there were five green Plantains order'd to be boiled for every six Men But to our great comfort when we were almost at our Witsend we descried a Sail at this Night who came to an Anchor close by us We soon got up our Anchor and took her without any resistance This was a great Ship of about Tuns She was deeply laden with Flower Sugar Brandy Wine about Tuns of Marmalet of Quinces a considerable quantity of Salt  with some Tuns of Linnen and WoollenCloth so that now we might supply our selves with Provisions for four or five Years I was put on board this Prize in behalf of Captain  Dampier  and our Ship's Company and the Master of the  Cinqueports  was put on board as Chief for Captain  Stradling  and their Ship's Company Then we sunk our Bark which had carried us up to  Santa Maria  and with our two Ships and great Prize stood across the Bay of  Panama  to the Westward amongst the  Kings  or  Pearl Islands May  the th we saw the  Kings Island  bearing N dist Leagues The th we anchor'd in the Bay of  Panama  the Island  Tabago  bearing N dist Leagues the  Kings Island  E S E dist Leagues The th we weighed and ran nearer to the Island  Tabago  and brought it to bear N by E dist three Leagues Here we anchor'd on purpose to romage our Prize The th th th and th vve continued taking Provisions out of her as Wine Brandy Sugar Flower  c  And on the th a small Bark of about Tuns coming in sight vve sent our Longboat and Canoa and took her She had little in her only a small quantity of Money This Bark Captain  Stradling  kept for his ovvn use  Here our Captain and Captain  Stradling  having some disagreement concluded  to part Company which accordingly they did and the Men of each Ship had their liberty to go in vvhich Ship they thought convenient So five of our Men vvent to Captain  Stradling  and five of his came to us We vvere told by the Prisoners that there vvere Dollars on board our Prize that they vvere taken in by stealth at  Lima  and lay at the bottom in the Run of the Ship Our Captain did not believe this and vvas unvvilling to tarry longer that vve might have romaged her to the bottom because he thought loss of time vvould spoil his greater Designs Having therefore taken out a quantity of Provisions she vvas dismiss'd And vve on the th of  May  parted from the  Cinqueports  intending to beat up upon the Coast of  Peru  again and this day passed by the Island  Iguanos  This Island is not very high It is very vvoody and has a very good anchoringplace overagainst the main Land in Fathom Water Here is also very good fresh Water and if occasion be you may haul your Ship ashoar and clean For the Water rises and falls ten or eleven Foot And on the Landside is good sandy Ground This will defend you from the S E for these Winds often blow very hard The Marks of this Island are that to the S W is  Puntamala  or bad Point You must not  come near it for it hath a great many Rocks and Shoals which come near a League into the Sea From this  Puntamala  we stood away to the Southward for the Coast of  Peru  And on the twenty ninth of  May  we saw Land which proved to be the Island of  Gallo  From  Puntamala  and during our stay in the Bay of  Panama  we had for the most part dirty squally weather with much Thunder and Lightning and very uncertain Gales but mostly between the South and the West We stood off and on for five Days endeavouring to weather the Island  Gallo  but here being a strong Current setting to the Northward we found it difficult to do Yet after much turning on the th of  June  we weather'd it and proceeded along the Shore for the Coast of  Peru  On  June  the th we saw a Sail gave chase came up with her and took her she was about Tuns came from  Truxillo  and was bound for  Panama  laden with Flower Sugar Brandy  c  with some Bales of wrought Silk in her We took a Packet which we open'd The first Letter vve happen'd to read vvas from the Captain of the  French  Ship vve fought off the Island  Juan Fernando's  and met with again off the Port of  Lima  It vvas directed to the President of  Panama  and gave an  account That  he fought two English Privateers off the Island  J Fernandoes That  the smallest of the two fired but eight or ten Guns at him and then fell astern and did not come up again during the Fight as he believed for want of Wind  That  the great Ship  meaning us  fought him Broadside ond Broadside for more than six Hours  That  we kill'd them a great many Men and that at his coming to  Lima  he sent ashore thirty two of his Men each of which had either lost a Leg or an Arm or an Eye  and  That it was a great chance we had not taken him for that at our parting they had given themselves over as lost not having Men to defend themselves  We also had account by other Letters That the two  Frenchmen  which we saw off the Island  Juan Fernando's  had met with a Boat at Sea in which there was an  Englishman  and a Dog This was the Boat which belonged to Captain  Stradling  and which broke loose from him as we chas'd the  French  Ship off  Juan Fernando's  That the said two  French  Ships had been in at  Juan Fernando's  and had taken up our Anchors Cables Longboat with all Captain  Stradling  's Stores and his five Men and our Negro which was left there We also had advice that the  Spaniards  had fitted out two Men of War against us the one of brass Guns Pounders each the other of Guns of the some bigness  That each of them had Seamen and Soldiers choice Men and they lay cruising for us in the Bay of  Guiaquil  between Point  St Hellena  and  Cape Blanco  From the th to the th we were forced to go away with an easie Sail because of our Prize who sail'd very heavy And seeing it was likely to be a great hindrance to us in beating to Windward we concluded to go into some place to romage her Accordingly on the th we went into  Sardinas  Bay and anchor'd with our Prize in ten fathom Water about four Miles off Shore We durst not venture any further in by reason of so many Shoals and Banks of Sand which lie off it The SeaCoast here is inhabited by  Indians  but they are not very numerous Here are several small Rivers which run with fresh Water down to the Seaside And from this place by the Seaside all along to the Southward till you come to the Bay of  Tacames  are white Cliffs and many Shoals as far as to Point  Gallera  From this Bay of  Sardinas  six Leagues to the Southward is the great River of  St Jago  the Mouth of which is said to be  of a Mile over but in it is no good anchoring until you are got well within the Mouth and if you must needs go into the River keep near the Land on the South side This River is seldom made use of by Shipping it lying out of the way  only in case of necessity or by chance they put in for refreshment for here is plenty of all sorts of Provisions It hath on the Seaside or pieces of broken Ground of a whitish colour and at the Northend of them is the Bay of  Sardinas  wherein we careen'd our Ship and romaged our Prize and water'd at one of the freshwater Rivers the Water of which was white like Milk and both smelt and tasted very strong of Musk occasioned by the many Alligators swimming in the River  We shot several of them one of which measured thirty Feet in length and was bigger about than a large Bullock He is very full of great Scales from the Neck to the end of his Tail He has a very large sharp set of Teeth with very long Claws on his Feet It is an amphibious Creature living on Land as well as in the Water When they are lying on shore they look like a great fallen down Tree and for such One would take them at a distance They will run very fast on the Land and are of such strength that they will take a Horse or Cow and carry it down to the Water and there devour it They will seize on any thing as well on Land as in the Water and commonly make great havock amongst Cattle if there be any near the place where they Harbour which is commonly in fresh Water Rivers  The  Indians  are not greatly afraid of them neither in the Water nor on Land If they are pursued by them on Land they run in a Circle and this great Creature is not able to turn his unweildy Body so quick but that they easily get from him The  Indians  likewise go into the Water to seek them with a piece of Iron like a Harpoon at both ends and two pieces of Iron across This they hold by the middle in their Hand and the Alligators when they bite raise their Head out of the Water  Then the  Indians  hold out this piece of Iron to them at which they bite and it fastens in their Mouth and keeps it open like a Gag These Creatures lay Eggs about a hundred at a time Their Eggs are about the bigness of a Goose's but the Shell is almost as thick as an Ostridge's I have seen many of them They are quite round although Captain  Dampier  in Vol II Part II  page  says that these Eggs are longer than a Goose's which I suppose he took only upon Hearfay The Flesh of the Alligators is not fit to be eaten it being very strong and musky nay the very Water of the Rivers which they were in tasted so strong of them that is of Musk that a Draught of it would almost suffocate us By the Rivers side here were about fourteen or fifteen  Indian  Fishermen's Houses who as I suppose  were fled for fear of us For we could not see any of them all the time of our stay here  On the th having done all our business here and dismist our Prize after having taken a few odd things out we departed from this place and stood to the Southward for the Coast of  Peru  and the Prize stood to the Northward for  Panama  being the place whereto she was bound The st we saw a Sail being then off Cape St  Francisco  but in the Night lost her again This Cape St  Francisco  is a high Cape but far higher within Land than it is near the Waterside When you are North or South from it it seems like three Capes It is a woody mountainous Land and has white Cliffs It lies in the Latitude of d N Longitude from  London  West d m and we found the Variation to be deg min Westerly On the th we saw the Sail we had seen the other Day we soon came up with her and took her She was a small Bark of about forty five Tuns came from  Ria Lexa  and was bound for  Guiaquill  laden with Pitch Tar and Cordage And after we had taken out a small quantity of each she was dismissed On the th of  July  we saw the Island of  Plata  bearing E S F distance five Leagues This Island lies in the Latitude of  d  m S and from Cape St  Laurenzo  S E It is a pretty high Island but highest at the North end At some time of the Year here is said to be plenty of very good Turtle and on it are some small Trees or rather Bushes not fit for any use It is all round steep Rocks unless near the anchoring place which is on the Eastside And at both the North and South Points there are small steep Rocks and Shoals which stretch out into the Sea for a Mile or two Upon this Island is said to be no fresh Water  From hence we stood to the Southward and on the th fell in with Point  Saint Hellena  This Point is distant from the Island of  Plata  eighteen Leagues It is high Land and at a distance looks like an Island because the Land to the Northward is lower than it This Point is the North Point of the Bay of  Guiaquil  as Cape  Blanco  is the South Point In this Bay is the great Town or City of  Guiaquil  which is said to consist of nine hundred and fifty  Spanish  Houses besides  Indians  and to have five Parish Churches besides private Chapels It has a Governour who is next to the President of  Panama  although under none but the Viceroy of  Peru  It is said to be pretty well fortified to hinder the approach of an Enemy having two Forts the one standing at  the South end of the Town and the other upon a Hill  On the st we saw a Sail and stood towards her and next day being  July  the d came up with her She proved to be one of the  Spanish  Men of War which was fitted out on purpose to take us This was the Ship of thirty two Guns We being pretty near each other they gave us a broadside but we did not mind them all our care was to get the Weathergage In order to which while we carried too much Sail and the Wind blew very fresh our foretop Mast unfortunately came by the board Immediately we got our Hatchets and cut all clear way and our Captain ordered the Helm to be clapt a Weather and bore away The Enemy seeing this immediately bore away after us with all the Sail they could hoping to come up and take us for now they doubted not but they should take us We observing that our running had increased their Courage resolved thereupon to lie by and fight it out Captain  Dampier  's Opinion was that we could sail better upon one Mast than the Enemy and therefore that it was best to put before the Wind But however we being embayed chose rather to fight than to be chased ashoar So hoisting the bloody Flag at our Maintopmast Head with a  resolution neither to give nor take Quarter we began the fight and went to it as fast as we could load and fire The Enemy kept to windward at a good distance from us so that we could not come to make use of our small Arms But we divided the two Watches and one was to manage the great Guns whilst the other looked on and when those at the great Guns were weary the other were to take their places till they had refresh'd themselves Thus we fired I believe five Guns to his one We fired about and he about or and we fought him from twelve at Noon to half an hour past six at Night although at a good distance for he kept so far to windward of us that our shot sometimes would hardly reach him tho' his would at the same time fly over us At half an hour past six it growing duskish they left off firing and we did the same We had by good Providence none of our Men either kill'd or wounded by the Enemy only two thro' carelesness had their Hands and Faces blasted but in a small time they both recovered After our fight was over we got a spare Maintopmast which we had between Decks and our Carpenters went to work to fix it it being of it self too big for a Fore topMast VVe lay by all the Night and in the Morning betimes looked out for our Enemy  expecting to have the other Battle with him but contrary to our expectations he had made Sail from us in the Night Our Captain upon this resolved to quit the Coast of  Peru  and told us he design'd to go into the Bay of  Tacames  where he did not doubt but we should get Provision enough for now we had little besides Flower We were pretty well contented and stood away for the said Bay and on the th of  July  we passed by the Point of  Gallera  This Point is low towards the Seaside and plain even Ground on the top You must steer N E keeping off from it about a Mile to Leeward by reason of a Shoal which lies off it which Shoal is full of Rocks and Stones and lies all hid under Water And in the Point is a Bay of Sand which you may see when you come in with your Ship within the Point and coming over the said Bay you will see a little Lake of fresh Water running into the Sea and when the Tide is at the highest the Salt Water runs into it Wherefore if you would take in fresh Water here you must take care to go to the right of the said Spring and you will come to the Head of it where you will find excellent good Water in a Pond near unto a pleasant Grove of Trees about a Musketshot within Land But you must be sure to go well  armed when you fetch it For there commonly come down  Indians  who are always at War with the  Spaniards  and will rob and kill any white Men thinking all white Men to be  Spaniards  Here is said to be abundance of Ostridges and wild Asses  We passed by this Point of  Gallera  and the same Day anchored in the Bay of  Tacames  which was the place whereto we were bound and is distant from the Point of  Gallera  between two and three Leagues We anchored at this  Tacames  in six fathom Water Point  Gallera  bearing VV S VV distant between two and three Leagues At our coming in we sent our Boat ashore with twenty Men armed hoping to get some Provisions but the Inhabitants having notice of an Enemy's being in those Seas as soon as they saw us drove the Cattle from the VVaterside up into the Country and they themselves retired to the Mountains with their VVives and Children and all they had So our Men went into the Village which consisted of about fifty  Indian  Houses deserted by the Inhabitants Here in the River we found a Bark upon the Stocks a building of about fifty Tuns with new Plank enough by her to build another And we took another small Bark of about ten Tuns laden with Plantains This Bark we intended  to keep instead of a Longboat she had two Masts and two square Sails and we named her the  Dragon  The Road on the Coast of  Tacames  is lower Land than the Bay of St  Matthew  it is indifferent clear Ground but not very deep where you may anchor near the Mount And if you do not like to anchor near the Mount you may anchor where you will by the Main Land on the VVeatherside and there is VVater enough and no danger And if you send your Boat ashoar you may supply your self with both VVood and VVater In the River are pleasant Groves of Trees and it has in the entry of it a little Rock The Landmarks of the River are that the Land on the Leeside is high and you may see a white spot on it like a white Sheet  To the Northward eight Leagues is the Bay of St  Matthew  In this Bay is a large River the breadth of which is three quarters of a Mile but till you get within the Mouth you will find no good AnchorGround If you would go into it keep near the Land on the VVeather or South side This River is seldom used by the  Spaniards  but only for Refreshment for there is plenty of all sorts of Provisions and if their Ships be out of Repair they can here have them repaired Two Leagues  up the River are  Indian  People who sell to the  Spaniards  when they come here all sorts of Fruits as Coconuts Plantains Bonanoes  c  The CoconutTrees are from to and Foot in height mostly slender and streight They have Leaves some four fathom and four fathom and a half long and produce a Nut call'd a Coconut which with the outer Rind on is bigger than any Man's Head The outer Rind being taken off there appears a Shell some of which will hold near a Quart Within the Shell is the Nut and within the Nut is about a Pint and a half of pure clear VVater which is very cool brisk pleasant and sweet The Kernel of the Nut is also very good which if it be pretty old we scrape all to pieces the scrapings we set to soak in about a quart of fresh VVater for three or four hours and then strain the VVater which when strain'd hath both the colour and taste of Milk And if it stand a while it will have a thick scum on it not unlike Cream This Milk being boiled with Rice is accounted by our Doctors to be very nourishing for which reason we often give o  it to our sick Men The Leaves of the Tree serve to thatch Houses the outer Rind of the Nut to make LinnenCloth of it they also make Ropes for Ships a  Rigging Cables  c  which are a good Commodity in most places of the  EastIndies  The Shell of the Nut will make very pretty Drinkingcups It will also burn very well and make a very fierce and hot Fire The Kernel serves instead of Meat and the Water therein contained instead of Drink And if the Nut be very old the Kernel will of it self turn to Oyl which is often made use of to fry with but most commonly to burn in Lamps So that from this Tree as I may say they have Meat Drink Clothing Houses Firing and Rigging for their Ships These Trees may be known by any Ships passing by for they are void of Leaves except just at the top At the bottom of the Leaves the Coconuts grow or in a cluster and they hang by a small string which is full of joynts  The Plantaintree is about or foot in heighth and about four foot round The Leaves of the Tree are about eight or nine foot long and two foot broad and end in a round Point The Fruit grows at the bottom of the Leaf upon a great Stalk in a Cod of about eight Inches long and the bigness of a Blackpudding The Cod is of a fine yellow colour often speckled with red The Cod being taken off the inside of it is white but the Plantain it  self is yellow like Butter and as soft as a ripe Pear There will grow or sometimes upon a Stalk and five or six Stalks upon a Tree They are an extraordinary good Fruit and in most parts of the  East  and  WestIndies  there is great plenty of them  The BonanoeTree  See Fig XVII  is much the same only the Fruit is not so long as the Plantain being as I said before about eight Inches long and the Bonanoe not above six It grows in the same manner as the Plantain or in a cluster upon one Stalk The Fruit is very mellow and extraordinary sweet and good  The Landmarks of this River in the Bay of  St Matthew  are that the Bay is higher Land than that which is behind it towards the inward parts to the Cape of  St Francisco  or thereabouts It hath on the SeaCoast or pieces of broken Ground which are white and in the middle of them is the said Bay of  St Matthew  On the  st  of  July  we left the Bay of  Tacames  and carried our little Prize named the  Dragon  with us not designing to touch at any place till we come to the Gulf of  Nicoya  CHAP IV  The Island  Caneo  The Mountains called  Sierras de los Coronadas  The Gulf of  Nicoya  The Ship cleaned Mr  Clippinton  the ChiefMate leaves us A particular Description of

described The Crew divide part tarrying with Captain  Dampier  in the SouthSeas and part resolving to go for  India  FROM the Bay of  Tacames  in the Latitude of about d m North we stood away to the N W across the Bay of  Panama  and on the th of  August  we fell in with an Island which proved to be the Island  Caneo  It is an indifferent high Island and lies in the Latitude of d N It is not above a League round and the anchoringplace is on the N E side in fadom Water not above a quarter of a Mile from the Shore Here is said by our  Indian  Pilots to be extraordinary good Wood VVater Turtle and store of wild Hogs Near this Island are two Islands more and between them are several Shoals and not far off upon the main Land is  Puntamala  or bad Point and within  Puntamala  is a fine deep Bay in which Sir  Thomas Cavendish  formerly clean'd his Ship  From hence we coasted away to the VVestward and past by the  Sierras de los Coronadas  or the Crowned Mountains These Mountains are very remarkable there being none like them on this Coast From  the Crowned Mountains we still coasted away to the VVestward and passed by the four Rocks called by the  Spaniards Farallones de Queipo  These Rocks lie just at the VVestend of the Crowned Mountains and the Coast runs N N VV and S S E Near these Rocks is the River  Estrella  or the Star River This River is in the bottom of a large Bay and here is commonly a great Sea From this Bay to  Herradura  is Leagues  Herradura  is the South Point that makes the Gulf of  Nicoya  as  Cape Blanco  is the North VVe arrived at  Herradura  on the of  August  but past by it and went further into the Gulf till we came to many small Islands called by the  Spaniards  the  Middle Islands  because they lie in the middle of the Gulf VVe anchor'd between  Them  and the Bay of  Caldera  bringing the Bay of  Caldera  to bear East and the said  Middle Islands  to bear VVest Here we lay all this day but sent our little Prize the  Dragon  to view the Gulf and to find out a convenient place to lay our Ship ashore in And the next Morning being  August  the th our Captain and Carpenter went in the Canoa amongst the  Middle Islands  to see if there was any convenience amongst  Them  for laying our Ship aground In the Evening our Captain and Carpenter returned in the Canoa and brought on board two Turtles which  they caught as they were going ashore We presently went to work in cutting up the Turtle boiling roasting frying baking and stewing according as each one thought fit Our Captain and Carpenter had as they said found out a convenient place to lay our Ship ashore amongst these middle Islands So we intended to lie here this Night and if it was fair to go in on the morrow  The same Evening our little Prize returned to us again They had been up the River  Changel  and found two or three  Indian  Houses and some PlantainWalks The  Indians  climbed the Trees and cut down for them as many Plantains as they would have They found also two Canoas haul'd up upon the Sand and brought them both off In their way they caught eight Turtles and eat nothing of their own Provisions but fed upon Turtle during the Time they were from us They gave us an account that they had found out a very good and secure place at the Island St  Lucas  for us to lay our Ship a+shore in That it was in a fine deep Bay▪ which at the entrance was not above  Pistolshot  over That with five or six Guns upon each Point at the Entrance w  might so fortifie our selves as that no Enemy durst approach us for that ten o  us might desend our selves against fi  hundred However we found the  Middle Islands  to be as convenient as any place could be And our Captain seeming to like this place as well and knowing we could fortifie our selves as strongly here and with as little trouble we chose this place Accordingly on the th it being fair Weather and calm we towed our Ship in amongst the Islands and lay within Stones cast of the Shore all round with one Anchor a Head and a Cable out at our Stern which was made fast to a great Tree on the Shore As soon as we had fastened our Ship all Hands went ashore and began to build Tents for our Cooper and Sailmaker to work in and to put our Goods and Provisions in In the mean time our chief Mate was sent in the little  Dragon  with twenty Men armed and two Pattereroes to cruize in the Gulf where after he had cruized five or six Days he returned with a  Spanish  Bark of about forty Tuns She had in her some few Jars of Brandy Wine and some Sugar They were going to repair her she being very old and for that purpose had five or six Carpenters and Caukers on board who came very opportunely to help us to repair our Ship for we had great need of Workmen We took out our Powder Shot and all our Ammunition with all our Bread some of our Flower and our  two Quarterdeck Guns and put them on board this last Bark Then we got all the rest of our things ashore and made every thing ready for cleaning our Ship Our Men went ashore often with the Sain and caught store of Fish especially if they took the right time which was at the Flood and better in the Night than in the Day The d of  August  we sent our Canoas to an Island just by us upon which there were several old fallendown Houses the Thatch of which we brought away to make use of in burning the bottom of our Ship The bottom of our Ship was in many places eaten like a HoneyComb insomuch that the firm Plank was no thicker than an old Sixpence Nay in some places in the Hold we could thrust our Thumbs quite through with ease Our Ship being in this condition and we in want of Planks to new bottom her our Carpenter was forced to make a hard shift and stop the Leaks as well as he could with Nails and Oakam  September  the d Our Captain and Mr  Clippinton  the chief Mate falling out Mr  Clippinton  with twenty one of our Men seized upon the Bark in which was all our Ammunition and a great part of our Provisions and got up her anchor and went without the Islands From thence he sent us word that if any of us had  mind to go with him we should be welcome but however that we might not be quite destitute he would restore us all our Powder Shot and Ammunition reserving only two or three Barrels for his own use And according to his promise he put on shore our Powder Shot and other Ammunition in an  Indian  House to shelter it from the Rain and sent us word of his so doing And we went with our Canoas and fetcht it aboard  And now our Captain's design being to take the  Manila  Ship we went to work in getting our things aboard and watering and rigging our Ship And on the d we hal'd out from the  Middle Islands  and anchored in the Gulf Which before I proceed I shall here give you some Description of  See Fig XXVII  In this Gulf are several Islands as the Island of St  Lucas  and the Island of  Chira  To this latter Island the  Spanish  Ships come to take in their lading which is brought from  Nicoya  This Island is inhabited and lies in the Latitude of d m North and on the N E part is another Island called the Island  Guaiabas  near which is a Bar or Shoal Observe when you enter into this Gulf that you leave all the Islands to the Westward except the Island  Guaiabas  which has the Bar near it and steer close by the Island of  Chira  This Island is distant from from St  Lucas  eight Leagues and they lie from each other North and South To the S S W of the Island St  Lucas  distant about four Leagues are the  Middle Islands  They are a parcel of small Islands and amongst them is a good Harbour in which we wooded and watered and hal'd our Ship ashore  We found here several sorts of very good Fish as  Mullets Breams Silverfish  c Of Shellfish here is  Conchs Clams PearlOysters  and another sort of Oyster called the  GreatOyster  Of Birds here is great store  viz Maccaws  and  Pelicans  and  CarrionCrows  And of amphibious Creatures the  Guano  and the  SeaTurtle  The  Maccaw  is a very fine Bird his Feathers being of most sorts of Colours He is about the bigness of a Hawk and in shape like a Parrot only his Bill is perfectly white and his Feet and Legs quite black  The  CarrionCrow  is as big as a small Turkey and in all respects very like one for I never saw any difference neither in Colour nor Shape The Flesh of them both smells and tastes so strong of Musk that there is no eating of it These Creatures commonly resort to any place where any dead Creature is and feed upon it for which reason they are called  Carrion  But the reason why they are called  Crows  I know not for they are nothing like them but altogether like a wild Turkey  The  Pelican  See Fig XVIII  is almost as big as a Swan Its Colour is inclining to white only the tips of his Wings are brown It hath a long Bill of about twenty Inches with a very large Crop joyning to the lower part of his Bill and so descending by the Throat like a Bag or Satchel very observable and of a largeness almost beyond credit into which it receiveth Oysters Cockles Conchs  c  or any other Shellfish which being not able to break it retains them until they open and then vomiting them up picks out the Meat As for their making a Hole in their Breast to give their Blood to their Young I do not believe nor ever saw any such thing although I have seen thousands both young and old together and have eaten many of them They are good Food only they taste somewhat fishy They have broad Feet like a Duck being Waterfowls but they roost commonly on Rocks and in Trees and always set with their Heads to the Wind so that if the Wind changes whilst they are at roost they turn about their Heads to the Wind They are heavy Birds and fly very slow and always when they sit either on Rocks  Trees or in the Water they rest their Bills upon their Crop  The  Guano  See Fig XIX  is a sort of Creature some of which are found on Land some in the Water He is about three foot long more or less and is a very ugly Creature to look at having great sharp black and green Scales from the forepart of his Head to the end of his Tail and a set of great and sharp Teeth with four long Claws upon each Foot They breed commonly in the Roots of old Trees near the Water side and frequent the Water as well as Land When they are stewed with a little Spice they make good Broth and the Flesh looks very white and eats very well but if they are not extraordinarily well boiled they are very dangerous to eat making Men very sick and often putting them into a Feaver as we were informed by our Prisoners  Of  SeaTurtles  there are several sorts but we always account the green Turtle to be the best Meat They have several Islands and sandy Bays where they go to lay their Eggs Which they do in different places at different times For in some places as at the Island of  Ascension  in the Atlantick Ocean their common time of laying is in  April May June  and  July  In other places as in the Bay of  Motines  on the Coast of  Mexico  we took them ashore  laying their Eggs in the Months of  December  and  January  Here in the Gulf of  Nicoya  upon the same Coast of  Mexico  in the Latitude of between and d North we caught a great many of them and commonly found them full of Eggs in the Months of  August  and  September  Though therefore at one or at several constant places their season of laying is always the same yet in different places their Seasons are different I have been at the catching of them in most times of the Year and commonly found them full of Eggs When they want to lay they go ashore in some sandy Bay and with their Fins make a Hole in the Sand about two foot and a half deep wherein they lay their Eggs commonly about eighty or ninety at a time Then they cover them up with the Sand they had scraped out of the Hole and so leave them for the heat of the Sun to hatch Thus they lay two or three times in a Season and after they have laid they go off to Sea and leave the Young when hatcht to shift for themselves who as soon as they get out of the Shell and Sand retire to the Water The Eggs are round about the bigness of a Duck's with a white thin tough Skin over them but no Shell  Both the Eggs and the Turtle are extraordinary good Food as I have experienced many  times I have seen of this sort of Turtle several times from to and weight The lean of them before 'tis drest looks like Beef but the fat is as green as Grass and it is very wholesome Food  The  PearlOyster  is much about the bigness of our common Oyster but more flat and broad It hangs to the Rocks by a long stringy Beard like a Muscle The Pearl lies in the thickest part of it some have five six or seven Pearls in them The  Spaniards  make several Voyages to this Gulf of  Nicoya  and to the Island  California  for them The  Indians  go down in five six seven or eight fathom water and bring up eight ten or twelve Oysters at a time while the Men on board open them The Meat of this Oyster is very green and the Oyster fat I have eaten of this Oyster several times both boiled and stewed and found them to be tolerable good Victuals  The  Great Oyster  grows to the Rocks as other Oysters not hanging to them by a Beard as the PearlOyster When they are opened one part looks of a fine Red like a Cherry the other part is of a fine White I have eat of this sort of Oyster many times but it was for want of better Victuals They are so large that one of them cut in pieces and stewed is sufficient for a Meal for five or six Men  The  Muscles  here are so large that one of them when drest will suffice two Men and they are tolerable good Victuals when stewed with Pepper and Vinegar  From the middle Islands beforementioned to the Island of  Chira  is clear Ground and six or seven fathom Water When you sail up the Gulf you must keep nearer the Islands than the main Land because near the Main are several Sholes which stretch a considerable way From the Island  St Lucas  to Cape  Blanco  is nine Leagues Cape  Blanco  lies in the Latitude of d m North It has a small Island at the Point of it full of high Trees The Cape is high towards the inner Parts and appears plain and even The chief of what they bring from this Gulf is Salt Honey Maiz some Wheat and Fowls which they send yearly to  Panama  On the d of  September  having done our Business here we with our little  Dragon  Prize left this place intending to cruize to the Westward On the th of  October  we had Latitude by observation d m North Variation d m westerly And at the same time we saw the Land which proved to be two high Mounts called the Vulcans of  Guatimala  the one being of Water the other of Fire These two famous Mountains stand almost the one overagainst the other on  each side of the Valley that of Water being on the South side and that of Fire on the North nearer to the old City That of Water is a little higher than the other and yields a goodly Prospect being green all the Year round In the Year this Mountain was said to burst open and threw Water in such large quantities that it drowned the City of  Guatimala  which caused the Inhabitants to remove the City three Leagues further off where it now stands The Vulcan of Fire which stands opposite to that of Water is at some certain times especially in the rainy Season which is from  April  to  November  very terrible to the Inhabitants It sometimes throws out Stones as big as a House and breaks out with such a Flame that if it be in a dark Night although you be five or six Miles of yet by the Light thereof you may see to read a Letter written in a small Hand This was affirmed to us by several of our Prisoners Natives of the place  The th we had dirty squally Weather with very hard Gusts of Wind from the two Vulcans aforesaid with such prodigious Claps of Thunder and Flashes of Lightning as none of us ever saw or heard the like On the th we took a Bark of about eighty Tuns in ballast She came from  Suvartanejo  and was bound for  Ria Lexa  She had a small quantity of Provisions which was very welcome to us The Captain's name was  Christian Martin  a  Spaniard  born at the  Canaries  but brought up in  London  He was Servant formerly to Captain  Eaton  and came with him into the South Seas at which time he was Captain  Eaton  's Gunner but falling out with the Men ran away from them at the Island  Gorgonia  where he lay concealed six Days till the Ship was gone after which he cut him down two small Trees which he drew to the Waterside and bound them together with Twigs fixed a Mast and of two Shirts which he had with him made a Sail and having filled a large Bag with Oysters which he made fast to the said two Trees he in the Morning betimes put off from the Island  Gorgonia  and the next Day in the Afternoon got into the River of  Bonaventure  where he went ashore and had but ill usage from the  Spaniards  who sent him to  Lima  where he was examined cleared himself and was set at liberty He could speak very good  English  The th we had Latitude by observation d m North Variation d m Westerly being then off the great Vulcano of  Attitlan  This Vulcan commonly casts out smoak and under it are small Hills which are said to be always  green On the th we passed by the Vulcan of  Sapotitlan  which throws out vast quantities of Fire This and the Vulcan of  Sacatapeque  are reckoned two wonders of the World We observed off the Vulcan of  Sapotitlan  and found variation d m Westerly and had Latitude by observation d m North The th we saw the Hill of  Bernal  which makes the East point of the Gulf of  Tecoantepeque  We observed off it and found the variation by a good Amplitude to be d m Westerly and had Latitude d m N  The th we found our selves abreast of the Bay of  Tecoantepeque  which is very low Land and full of little Hills which look like small Islands This place is very subject to hard Gales of Wind at N E called  Tecoantepequers  from the place whence they come and they happen commonly about the New and Full Moons The best way therefore is to keep near the Shore after you are past the Bay or Gulf In the Gulf it self you may keep three or four Leagues off for it is shoal to that distance But when you are to the Westward of the Bay keep within two Leagues of the Shore that you may come to an anchor if occasion be For if you should chance to be driven off from Shore which frequently happens you will hardly be able to  get in four days so much as you will drive out in one For when you are driven out of sight of the Land you will have a strong Current which will drive you far to the S W  November  the th in the Even we saw four small White Islands lying close together On the Eastend of which about two Miles distance is a large Hummock which looks like an Island but is not the Land going from it to the Main being very low causes it till you are very near it to look like an Island This place is called  Suvartaneo  inhabited by  Spaniards  and  Indians  It lies in the Latitude of d m N and has a small Village of about forty Houses standing by the Seaside Here we anchored in fathom Water not above Pistolshot from the Village At our coming in we saw about  Spaniards  and  Indians  both Horse and Foot We fired eight or ten of our great Guns at them and they retired into the Woods Then we landed about of us and went to the Village and romaged it In it we found a great many small things with Packs of very good Flower We filled here two Boats load of Water but the Sea running high overset our Boats Our Men would have set the Village on fire but the Captain being ashore would not suffer them So on the th we went out with the Landwind and stood away to the Westward  The d we anchored in the Bay of  Martaba  under the Mountains of  Motines  Here we watered our Ship and found in a small River a great many large green Turtles the best I ever tasted On the th at Sunsetting we spied a Sail and immediately got every thing in a readiness for an Engagement not knowing but it might be the  Manila  Ship which we now began to expect shortly to see VVe were at this time sixty four of us Men and Boys all well in Health and did daily wish to have a sight of the  Manila  Ship We soon came up with the Ship we saw and took her She was a small Bark of about sixty Tuns from  California  laden with Plank and she had on board some parcels of Pearl which they had fish'd in the Gulf of  California  In this Bay of  Martaba  is a very good anchoring place defended from the East and NorthWest Winds And there is ten and twelve fathom Water clear Ground When you are ashore you will see a little River of fresh Water It was at this Rivulet that we water'd our Ship and in it found store of extraordinary large and very good green Turtle Near the Rivulet is a Road which strikes up into the Woods This Road leads to an  Indian  Town called  Mavota  It is said to be four Miles and a half from the Seaside  To the N W of this Bay of  Martaba  five or six Leagues towards the Seaside you will see broken Ground which looks like an Island It is called  Chasipi  On the S E of which is a little pleasant Valley of pure white Sand called the Valley of  Maguille  under the Jurisdiction of the City of  Colima  Observe that at the Point of  Chasipi  the  Motines  end The  Motines  are a long Ridge of Mountains reaching in length Leagues They abound in many rich Towns of  Spaniards Mullattoes Mostese  and  Indians  To the N W of the Point of  Chasipi  you will find a plain even Land towards the Seaside which is full of Coconut Trees planted here for the use of those Ships which come from the Gulf of  California  Two or three Leagues distant from this row of Trees to the N W is some broken Ground and at the end of the broken Ground stands a Vulcan which is said always to smoak It is called the Vulcan of  Colima  and the broken Ground is called the Valley of  Corelan  It is all planted with Cocoa's such as we make Chocolate of This Valley is distant from the Town of  Colima  N W Leagues And not far from the Valley is a Mount very round called the Mount of St  Jago  The Mount of St  Jago  is in the Port of  Quelagna  To know it you must observe that there is a Rock close by the said  Mount which looks very white and may be seen a great distance There is a Bay at the end of it where is a plain of green Trees If you would go to this Port of  Quelagna  you must steer streight to the Bay For there are two very good Harbours which have good Anchorground and will hold a great many Ships They are called the  Caletas  On the N W side of the said Bay is another very good Port and close by it is the Port of  Quelagna  and between the Port of  Quelagna  and the white Rock is a very good Port in which you are Landlock'd from all Winds and this is called the Port of St  Jago  but is not inhabited Five or six Leagues to the N VV of the white Rock is a little Mount coming near to which you will see an indifferent high Mount full of broken Ground and a Rock joining to it which is in form of a SugarLoaf and on the N W side of that Rock there is a Bay a League wide  It was on the th of  December  that we came into this Bay in which we saw a Sail stood in after her and soon took her All the way we chased her they heaved their things overboard after which they all took to their Boat and got ashore VVe took possession of the Vessel which was a new Vessel of about sixty Tuns And in her we found a great deal  of Powder and Shot scattered up and down in all Parts of the Vessel We suppose therefore that this Ship lay here with Ammunition to supply the  Manila  Ship But upon our chacing of her they threw most of it overboard This Bay is called the Bay of  Navidad  From this Bay of  Navidad  or the  Nativity  we still coasted along to the Westward At the N W end of this Port is another Port which is called  Chametla  It is a Port defended from the N W and S E Winds Two Leagues to the N W of it is an Island and about it lie four or five Rocks which come from the main Land They lie to the N N E and may plainly be seen and at the East end of them you may see the Vulcan of  Colima  On the th in the Morning being off the Vulcan of  Colima  we saw a Sail and soon came up with her She proved to be the  Manila  Ship So we being all provided gave her several broadsides before she could get any of her Guns clear For they did not suspect us to be an Enemy and were not at all prepared for us Capt  Martin  whom I formerly mentioned was then a Prisoner on board us He advised to lay her aboard immediately while they were all in a hurry and that this would be the only way to take her but  if we gave them so much time as to get out their great Guns they would certainly beat us in pieces and we should lose an opportunity of making our selves masters of the value of sixteen Millions of Pieces of Eight And accordingly it happened For time being delayed in quarrelling between those of us that would lay her aboard and those that would not the Enemy got out a tire of Guns and then were too hard for us so that we could not lie along her side to do her any considerable damage For our five Pound shot which was the biggest we had signified little against such a Ship as she was but any of her shot which were and Pounders if any of them happened to strike  Ʋs  our Ship being very much decayed it would drive in a piece of Plank of three or four Foot So being much damaged and receiving particularly a shot from the Enemy between Wind and Water in our Powder Room by which we had two foot of Plank driven in on each side the Stem the Signal was made to stand off from the Enemy  Thus our Design being disappointed all our Men grew discontented and were for going Home knowing we could do no good in these Parts either for our selves or Owners having Provision but for three Months and that very short and our  Ship being ready of her self to fall in Pieces Our Captain desired our consent to cruize here six Weeks longer and then he would permit us to go for  India  to some Friend's Factory where we might all dispose of our selves as we should think most for our advantage To this we all agreed And accordingly cruized along shore to the Eastward in sight of the Land and passed by several noted Ports as  Acapulco  Port  Angels  Port  Guatulco  and several others Of which I shall speak in my Description of the Coasts  Our Design now was to go into the Gulf of  Amapalla  to new Water our Ship and Bark for our intended Voyage to  India  On the th of  January  we met with vast quantities of Fish so that in half an hours time we caught of  Albicores  from sixty to ninety Pound weight no fewer than fifty eight And small Fish of about five Inches were so numerous that with a Bucket we haul'd up fourteen sixteen eighteen and sometimes twenty at a time  The  Albicore  See Fig XXI  is about four or five Foot in length some more some less weighing from to and pound weight He hath eleven Fins on his back one pretty large one middling one and nine small yellow ones near the Tail He hath one large Fin on each side near the Gills and  Fins under his Belly one on each side underneath near the Gills one near the middle of the Belly and nine small yellow Fins extending to his Tail It is a very fleshy Fish having little or no Bones except the Backbone and is extraordinary good Victuals It is a prodigious strong Fish when in the Water They prey mostly upon the Flyingfish as do the Dolphins Bonetoes  c  On the th it was concluded between Captain  Dampier  and of our Men to continue in the SouthSeas but upon what Terms this Agreement was made was kept secret We who were resolved to go for  India  used our endeavour to get into the Gulf of  Amapalla  which was the place we design'd to water at with all the haste we could Where we anchor'd on the th of  January    And the same day the Provisions being equally parted according to the directions of the Owners Agent and four great Guns with some small Arms Powder and Shot  c  being taken out for us we that is of us who resolved to go in the Bark for  India  went on shore in order to water our Vessel for the said Voyage  CHAP V  A particular

the entrance of the Gulf of  California  in the Latitude of d m N to the Port of  Valdivia  in the Latitude of d S so far as I knew them my self or could get an account of them from the  Spaniards  And first on the main Land you will see the Hill called  Zalisco  It is a very high Hill with a bending on the top and close to this Hill is a white Rock called  Maxentelbo  which at three or four Leagues distance looks like a Ship under Sail And behind the Hill of  Zalisco  is a great Town of the same Name inhabited by  Spaniards Mullattoes Mostese  and  Indians  And the Main here all along is full of Cocoawalks with Estantions or Farms of Beeves  The CocoaTree is small and the Nut or Kernel bigger than an Almond and ripens in a great Husk wherein are sometimes nay Cocoas These Cocoas are made use of to make Chocolate And as in  England  we go to the Tavern to drink a Glass of Wine so they do here upon this Coast of  Mexico  as frequently go to their Markets to drink a Dish of Chocolate And the  Indians  count it a very wholesom Drink We were glad whilst we were upon this Coast to make three Meals a Day of it for near a Month We would much rather if we could have fed upon Flesh But however living near a Month upon Chocolate it made us very fat and we found that it kept us very well in Health Whether if we had lived upon it much longer it would have done us hurt I know not but I am apt  to believe it would have increased our Fat too fast and so have made us unhealthy  From the white Rock called  Maxentelbo  twenty Leagues to the South are three great Islands called  Maria  's and a little one called the  Low Island  and amongst them are several small Rocks These Islands are of an indifferent height and are very full of Wood The Westermost is the biggest and between the Islands and the Main is said to be good anchoring in eight ten twelve and fourteen fathom Water good fast Ground The Islands are not inhabited and about them is said to be commonly store of Seals and Turtle and several sorts of very good Fish Whether these Islands have any fresh Water upon them I know not but I am apt to think they may  Fourteen Leagues to the S S W of the Islands  Maria  's are the Rocks or Islands of  Pontique  They lie from the Main about a League You may sail between them and the Mainland without any danger They take up two Leagues in length and the Westermost of them looks like a Ship without a Mast You may sail between them for there is no danger but what is visible The Land here by the Seaside is low but within the Country it is very high and ragged And about a League to  the Eastward of these Islands is the Point of  Pontique  This Point at a distance looks like an Island It is a high round Hill and very barren being only a ragged Rock From this Point to the Eastward for fourteen Leagues runs a deep Bay and on the North end it is low Land This Bay is very well inhabited by  Spaniards Mullattoes Mostese  and  Indians  Here are a great many Gardens of Cocoa and all this Bay and the Valleys are under the Jurisdiction of the Governor of the City of  Compostella  At the East end of this Bay is the Cape  Corrientes  which Cape lies in the Latitude of about d m North It is high Land and full of sharp ragged Hills Observe when you sail near this Cape if it blow hard from the N W as it commonly doth that four or five Leagues to the S E of the Cape is broken Ground towards the Seaside Steer exactly to it and on the S E side of the said broken Ground you will find a good convenient place where you may anchor and in it you are defended from most Winds This place is called by the Pilots  Salina's  because near it they make Salt The Cape  Corrientes  is very high Land It hath on it a few Trees and within the Land near the said Cape is a high Mountain which has three sharp Pikes on the top somewhat  like a Crown It is called  Coronada  or the CrownedMountain The Seawinds hereabouts are commonly at N W and the Landwind at North  From Cape  Corrientes  S E by E runneth a great Bay in which are three or four Islands called the Islands of  Chametly  they are little low Islands and between them and the Main there is a very good place to anchor in and near this anchoring place the Main is inhabited by  Indians  who are Fishermen and fish for the City of the  Purification  Which is a large City and said to be about fourteen Leagues within Land  From the Bay of  Chametly  to the S E twenty Leagues is the Port of St  Jago  a very good Port in which you are defended from all Winds but near it are no Inhabitants Not far from this Port is the Vulcan of  Alima  five Leagues within the Land  From the Port of St  Jago  to the S E sixteen Leagues is the Port of  Navidad  or the  Nativity  between which two Ports are several small Ports and many Rocks and Shoals so that it is bad going into them and besides for want of Trade they are seldom or never made use of by the  Spaniards  The Port of  Navidad  is a very good Port in which is Water and Wood Here the  Spaniards  build Ships  the biggest they have in these Parts of the World And here they built the first that ever was known to sail from  America  to the  EastIndies  At this place on the th of  December  we took a new Bark of about fifty Tuns in which we found some Bacon Fowls Bread and Rice with some Powder and Shot At our chasing of her the Men after they had heaved most of their things overboard took to their Boat and got ashore This Port lies in the Latitude of d m N  From hence to the Bay of  Salagua  or Saltwater Bay is eight Leagues It was at this place that Captain  Dampier  Vol I  page  gives an account that the  Manila  Ship sets ashore her Passengers that are bound for the City of  Mexico  But now the Viceroy finding an inconvenience in their so doing has given a positive Command that they should not put any of their Men or Goods ashore till their arrival at  Acapulco  Because it was usual with them when they set ashore their Passengers to convey away a great deal of the Goods and so defrauded the King of his Customs  From this place to the Port  Desapan  is sixteen Leagues and half a League within the Land is a Town called  JesuChristo  said to be a large handsome Town At this place begin the high Hills called  Motines  which stretch twenty five Leagues to the S E These Hills abound in many rich Towns of  Spaniards  and  Indians  And here are abundance of Cocoawalks and Farms of Cattle The Land by the Seaside is mountainous and rocky and by the Water it is all along planted with Cocoanut Trees for the use of those Ships which come hereabouts and have occasion for Chocolate Hereabouts you will see the Vulcan of  Colima  which is said always to smoak and sometimes though seldom to burst out with Fire Under these Hills on the th of  November  we took a Bark of about sixty Tuns laden with Plank She came from the Gulf of  California  where they had been fishing for Pearls of which we found a few Parcels Under the same Mountains in the Bay of  Stabata  we water'd our Ship and found a great many very good green Turtle  At the East end of these Mountains of  Motines  is the River  Sacaticli  a League up which River is a Town of the same Name Near this River are some pieces of broken Ground the least of which is Sandy and has no Trees on the top of it From hence S E to  Estapa  is sixteen Leagues in all which distance there is neither Hill nor high Land but in most places 'tis full of Trees and continues so till you come to a thick green spot of  Trees A little to the Eastward of  Estapa  are some great high Mountains called the Mountains of  Chequetan  They lie within Land and are ten or twelve Leagues in length To the Eastward of this place twenty Leagues is the Mount of  Petaplan  By this Mount are a great many Cocoawalks and near ro the Cocoawalks is the Town of  Petaplan  which stands behind the Mountain This Town is said to be a large Town and very well inhabited The Land near it is full of small Hills and Valleys The Hills are barren but the Valleys are said to be green almost all the Year The Hill of  Petaplan  is a high Hill At a distance it looks like an Island and about it are a great many Rocks but all visible so that if you please you may go between them where if occasion be you may anchor and will not find less than nine ten or eleven fathom Water This Hill I make to lie in the Latitude of d m North From hence to the Port of  Acapulco  is eight Leagues all along a sandy Bay and low even Land  Acapulco  is a Port of great Trade It is the place where the  Spaniards  embark from  Mexico  for  China  and the  Philippine  Islands Which is a particular Priviledge it has For no other Port durst trade to any part of the  EastIndies  but from hence It is  distant from the City of  Mexico  eighty Leagues and all Goods are carried from hence thither on Mules though it is a very bad way This is the chief Port for  Mexico  on the whole Westside of  America  It is a very good and large Port and in it may lie a hundred Sail of Ships all Landlock'd and secure from all Winds and Weather It lies in the Latitude of d m North The Town consists of about Families most  Spaniards  and has for its defence a Castle of between forty and fifty Brass Guns each said to carry a thirtysix pound Ball The Castle stands in a Valley between two noted Hills one of which is almost like a Sugarloaf and the other is cut in two at the top this is called the Hill  Cauca  These Hills are the highest Land hereabouts and both to the East and West of them it is all low Land for several Leagues The Town stands at the N W end of the Harbour in a deep Bay It is said to be a pretty compacted Town If you would enter into this Port bring the Hill  Cauca  to bear N ½ E from you then go to the S E of the Island which is at the Mouth of the Harbour called the  least Island  and after that have a care of coming near a dangerous Shole called the  Grifo  But if the Wind should be Northerly then you may go to the westward of the great Island  This is the  China  Ships entrance It is the narrowest Channel and the Water is very deep but Ships coming from the Eastward come in at the East Channel between the Main and a great Shole of Sand but in their Entrance keep as near the Main as they can You may know this Port by the high Land for it is all low to the East and West of it and all along for several Leagues sandy Bays  A League from this Port of  Acapulco  is Port  Marquis  It is a very good Port and in it is good Wood and Water And here are three or four  Indian  Houses belonging to Fishermen who fish for the Town of  Acapulco  A little to the Eastward of these Houses are small Islands with some  Indian  Fishermens Houses on them And here they dry a great deal of Fish with which they supply their Town and Ships at  Acapulco  From these three small Islands to the River of  Naguala  is six Leagues It is a small River with only five or six poor Fishermens Houses from whence by Land is a good Path leading to  Acapulco  and by Sea it is a bold Coast and deep Water  From the River of  Naguala  to the Fishingplace of  Don Garcia  S E is five Leagues all even Land and a sandy Bay Here live or  Indian  Slaves who dry  Fish which they sell ready dried by wholesale  From the Fishingplace of  Don Garcia  to the Hill of  Cecorillo  S E is six Leagues and near the Waterside all even Land and sandy This Hill of  Cecorillo  is a small round Hill close to the Waterside and right against it about a League from the Shore are five or six Rocks and all round them it is shole water  From the Hill of  Cecorillo  to the River of  Taclamanca  is two Leagues Here live eight or ten Families of  Indian  People who employ their Time in fishing  From the River  Taclamanca  to Point  Gallera  is eight or nine Leagues The first four Leagues the Land is all along Wood and the other half way it is broken Ground by the Seaside there being seven Cliffs of a whitish Colour And off of these Cliffs about a league distance from the shore are several Shoals and for two Leagues off you have scarce two fathom Water  From Point  Gallera  to the Morro or Mount of  Hermoso  is seven Leagues the Land mountainous within and full of little Rocks by the Seaside This Mount of  Hermoso  is a plain Mount and at the top very even and about a Mile from the shore right off the said Mount is a great Sand on which several good Ships have  been lost A little to the S E of this Sand is a hilly Island a league from the Main called  Alcatrazes  and overagainst it is a fresh Water River where you may water your Ship if you have occasion Here live several  Indian  People with a  Spanish  Friar And round about the Island are several small Islands or rather Rocks And from the Main on the Eastside of the Island cometh out a Shoal of Rocks and Sand which stretch off to Sea as far as the Island Therefore it is dangerous going in at the Eastend but at the Westend you may safely go in and on the inside of the Island is a good anchoring place  Upon this Coast of  Mexico  for the most part the Landwinds are at N W and N N W and the Seawinds from the W to the S W according as the Land trends away So that all the way if you keep within eighty or ninety Leagues of the Land you must make use of the Land and Seabreezes which commonly blow hereabouts pretty fresh The Land here is not very high It is woody but within the Country mountainous Here are seven or eight whitish Cliffs by the Seaside which are very remarkable because there are none so white and thick together on all the Coast  From the Island  Alcatrazes  to the Port of  Escondedo  is eight Leagues Its East Point butting into the Sea more by half a League than the West It is a smooth and good Port and here is good wooding and watering Near this Port is a little Island which makes the Port within which Island you may ride with great Security from the West and Southwest Winds and may venture to go ashore without any danger And from this Port is a Road leading to several great Towns in the Country  From  Escondedo  to the River  Messias  is six Leagues and between  Escondedo  and the River  Messias  is the River of  Aqua Dulce  or SweetwaterRiver right against which are two Rocks one on each side At the Mouth of the River  Messias  is fresh Water and in the times of the Rains it overflows its Banks and hinders the Inhabitants in their Affairs and very often drowns many of their Cattle which feed near the Banks of it The Banks of this River are very well peopled with  Indians  But hereabouts the Coast is much troubled with Calms Off from this River  Messias  at a league distance is a large Island which has several small Islands or rather Rocks about it  From these Islands to the River  Galler  is eighteen Leagues all mountainous with+in  Land and a wild Country full of small Bays but no Port having many Mangrovetrees and several other Trees fit for Masts Right off this River of  Gallera  about three quarters of a Mile from the Main and six Leagues to the Westward of Port  Angels  is a small rocky Island between which and the Main is very good anchoring in fifteen sixteen and seventeen fathom Water The Seawinds hereabouts are commonly at W S W and S W and the Landwinds at North Whether there be any Water upon this Island I do not know but never heard of any neither could any of our Prisoners tell us the name of it It has some small Trees or rather Bushes growing on it but they are fit for no use  From this Island as I said before to the Port  Angels  is six Leagues It is a good Port and seldom without shipping Here is a small Town of about thirty Houses inhabited mostly by  Spaniards  The Town is situated on the Westside of the Port and in the Town are said to be two pretty little Churches This Town has great trading to it for Hides and Tallow and sends a great quantity of Goods by Land to  Mexico  and several other Inland Towns and Villages VVhen you enter this Port you must keep to the Eastward of a Rock and Shoal The Port lies in the  Latitude of d m North Captain  Dampier  in Vol I  page  makes the Port of  Guatulco  to lie in the Latitude of d m North VVe did the same But then  page  he makes Port  Angels  which is to the Northward of it to lie in the Latitude of but d North which we made to lie in d m North that is Miles to the Northward of  Guatulco  VVhereas he makes it miles to the Southward of it But I suppose it is a mistake in the Printing The Coast runs here VV N VV and E S E The Tide rises and falls five foot the Flood setting to the N E and the Ebb to the S W  From Port  Angels  to the  Caletta  is two Leagues It is a very good Port but hath neither VVood nor fresh VVater Have a great care of four or five Rocks which lie out from its S E Point stretching a Mile and half into the Sea Between the  Caletta  and Port  Angels  is said to be a very dangerous Shoal and that it bears from the Point of Port  Angels  S S E distance one League  The Port  Angels  is in form like to  Guatulco  but not so broad nor so good though the  Spaniards  reckon it to be an extraordinary Port yet there is a great deal of difference between it and  Guatulco  In Port  Angels  are several anchoring places  On the S E side you will ride most secure because it keeps you from the Winds There is high Land on each side and on the Westside is a Rock and without the Rock is a Shoal of Sand Within the Rock are two little  Caletta's  or Bays in which is good anchoring for a small Vessel and in each of these two Bays is a little Brook of fresh Water which have their beginning from a plain of Sand and if you go to the end of the Plain you will see their Head In this Port are very good Trees that upon occasion will serve to make Masts for Ships Here are also a great many Farms of Beeves with good store of Maiz Hogs Fowls  c  And here they make Salt not only to serve their own occasions but also to supply several Towns and Villages hereabouts  From this Port of  Angels  to the Port of  Guatulco  is Leagues In the way are several Rocks Islands and Rivers At the Island  Sacrificio  on the inside is secure riding from all Winds in five six and seven fathom water And here you may wood and water your Ship if you have occasion Hereabouts are excellent Pearls found in seven fathom water This Port of  Guatulco  is famous for its being taken by our  English  Hero Sir  Francis Drake  in the Year who in one House took a  Bushel of Money It was afterwards taken and burnt by Sir  Tho Cavendish  in the year But it has always been famous for being the Port in which from  Mexico  they send all such Goods as they design for  Peru  'Tis also the Seaport for the great Cities of  Coaxica  and  Orata  It is distant from  Mexico  Leagues from  Coaxica  and from  Orata  It is all along high and mountainous Land The Port lieth hid and you cannot see it till you come within a League of it About a League from the Port is a small round Island called  Tangola  which is full of Hills and Trees And close by the West Point of the Port is a Rock and three quarters of a mile to the Eastward of the Rock and in the middle of the entrance of the Port lieth the  Buffadore  which is a small Rock and when the Winds blow at S W the Sea breaketh a great heighth upon it When therefore you would enter this Port keep West from  Tangola  till you have brought the middle of the Port to bear due North Then keep an equal distance between the  Buffadore  and the East Point of the Port The best anchoring is on the West side due North from the Town which consists of about Houses  Spaniards Mullattoes Mostese  and  Indians  In it is also a large Church with two small Chapels and the Houses are very  view of port of Guatulcoe  Fig  view of port of Tequantepeque  Fig  view of port of Sonsonate  Fig  well built of Stone and Brick This Port lies in the Latitude of d m N  See Fig XXII  And we found d m westerly variation  From  Guatulco  to the River of  Capalita  is one League It is a very deep and swift River and the Tide rises and falls five or six Foot  From the River of  Capalita  to the River  Simatlan  is three Leagues This River is inhabited by  Indians  and near to the Seaside are a great many Plantainwalks The River comes as it were from the Point of  Ajuta  By the Seaside are a great many Farms of Cattle  From the River  Simatlan  to the Point of  Ajuta  is two Leagues Thence to the Islands of  Destata  is five Leagues all high mountainous Land The Country hereabouts is very populous Four Leagues within Land is said to be a great Town called  ElObispo  It hath as is said four Churches and at least Houses All hereabouts are Plantainwalks also several Estantions or Farms of Cattle On the Seaside upon the Banks of the River of  Destata  which is rightagainst the two Islands of  Destata  is a large  Indian  Town with not above three or four  Spaniards  in it who lord it over the poor  Indians  From the Islands of  Destata  to the Morro or Mount of  Bamba  is four Leagues  Right off it is a shoal of Sand a mile from the shore which at Highwater is said to have but six foot Water upon it This Mount of  Bamba  is a pretty high Land and very rocky  From this Mount of  Bamba  to the Mount of  Mazatlan  is three Leagues This  Mazatlan  has a River of fresh Water and an anchoring place which is full of Rocks The top of the Port look  white being all covered with Fowls Dung so that there is none like it on all the Coast except it be at  Salina  Hereabouts the Coast is very windy and from the N E come Hurricanes or  Tecoantepequers  From the Mount of  Mazatlan  to the Port of  Salinas  is four Leagues By this  Salinas  the low Land beginneth And near it are two Rocks Here is made abundance of Salt and the Inhabitants of  Tecoantepeque  bring hither abundance of Meat Tallow and Hides to sell From this Port many Commodities are shipp'd for the South Sea to the great inriching of the Town which consist of about fifty Houses of Merchants who have the advantage of trading in the North and South Seas They trade from the North Sea up the River of  Guasickwalpo  in small Barks and then have but Leagues hither good Road as is said so that Waggons pass it  Five or six Leagues from hence is the great Town of  Tecoantepeque  a Bishop's See and a very rich place All along here the Coast is very populous and great store of Pearl is found near the Shore in the Bay of  Tecoantepeque  which is a good Port but much subject to N and N E Winds which at certain times blow very hard VVhen you are off this Port of  Tecoantepeque  do not come nearer the Land than two Leagues For for Leagues it is all along shallow VVater But if you have occasion send in small Boats or Canoas It is all along low Land excepting the Hill  Carbon  which is a round Hill almost like a Sugarloaf Near it is the River of  Tecoantepeque  on the Banks of which the Town is situated In going into this River you must go over a Bar of Sand near unto which Bar are some small Hills that lie a little within the low Land in the River and are Islands VVhen they appear to you like Hills you may know it to be the Bar and on the N E side is the Channel  See Fig XXIII  This  Tecoantepeque  is a Harbour for small Vessels such as trade to  Acapulco Ria Lexa Guatimala  and  Panama  And here upon some occasions Ships which come from the Coast of  Peru  call in in their way to  Acapulco  This is the chief Port for  Guaxaca  as  la Trinidad  is for  Guatimala Ria Lexa  for  Nicaragua  and  Golfo de Salinas  for  Costa Rica  Some few Years since a  French  Pyrate being in this Bay landed and after the loss of some of his Men took this Town of  Tecoantepeque  with great slaughter of the Inhabitants The VVomen to the number of about fifty they detained as Prisoners and carried them to the Gulf of  Amapalla  where after they had kept them two Months and had made use of them according to their own VVills they after an inhumane manner cut of their Noses and Ears and so sent them back to their Husbands This Port of  Tecoantepeque  lies in the Latitude of d m North and we found variation just off it by a good amplitude to be d m VVesterly  At our passing by this place we caught store of  Catfish  These Fish are of various sizes being from half a Foot to six Foot in length It hath three Fins one on his Back and one on each side near his Gills each of which Fins has a sharp stiff Bone so that we are very careful when we catch them in taking them off the Hook least they should strike those sharp still Bones into our Hands which if they do it is ten to one but a Man loses the use of his Hand by it He hath a great wide Mouth and near it several small white grisly Strings that come out like Cats  Whiskers which is the reason they are called  Catfish  They are a good sort of Fish and the young ones eat much like a Whiting  From the Port of  Tecoantepeque  to the Bar of  Mosquito  's is eight Leagues It seems to the Eastward to be a great many Hills And from the Bar of  Mosquito's  to the Hill of  Bernall  is seven Leagues In all which distance is very good anchoring when the  Tecoantepequers  blow hard Out of the Port of  Mosquito's  cometh a River by which is abundance of Shoals Towards the Seaside and to the N W hereabouts it is low Land From the Hill of  Bernal  to  Elzerro de la Encommendi  or the  Hill of Recommending  is five Leagues This  Bernal  makes the East Point of  Tecoantepeque  as the Point of  Salina  does the West The Land hereabouts is very hilly and mountainous but the Hill of  Bernal  is the greatest The Mountain of  Encommendi  is not very high It is plain on the top and lies half a League from the Seaside and on the side of it is fixt an artificial Cross for which Reason it is called  Elzerro de la Encommendi  or the  Cross of Recommending  You may anchor where you please near to this Mount for it is common for those Ships that are bound to the Port of  Tecoantepeque  if the Wind blows hard as it often does to anchor here when they cannot fetch the  Port of  Mosquito's  This Hill of  Bernal  lies in the Latitude of d North and we found the variation by a good amplitude to be d m Westerly  From the  Cross of Recommending  to the Vulcan of  Soconusco  is seven Leagues It is all very high Land And two or three Leagues from the Shore it looks almost like a Sugarloaf In the Country the Land is very high but the great Vulcan of  Soconusco  is the highest hereabouts Every Night we saw abundance of Fires up and down in the Valleys These Fires were made to burn down the Timber the Ashes of which they reckon does mightily fatten the Land For after the Trees and Bushes are burnt down the Ashes of them makes the Land look very black but in a Fortnights time if they chance to have two or three showers of Rain the Land will look very green and pleasant This is the best and only way they have of fattening their Land Near to this Vulcan of  Soconusco  to the S E is the River of  Soconusco  upon the Banks of which is situated a large  Indian  Town of the same Name For you must observe that most of these Towns and Rivers take their Name from some famous Mountain Hill or Vulcan standing by them The Coast here all along for many Leagues runs N W and S E  From the Vulcan of  Soconusco  to the Vulcans of  Amilpas  is twelve Leagues This is all very high and remarkable Land The two highest Vulcans have each a River of fresh Water right against them These Vulcans send out Smoke sometimes but not often  From the Eastermost Vulcan of  Amilpas  to the Vulcan of  Sapotittlan  is seven Leagues here and there a sandy Bay full of little Creeks the Coast still stretching away S E This Vulcan of  Sapotittlan  is a great Vulcan and it is all towards the Seaside very full of Trees I have heard that before the  Spaniards  found out  Mexico  this Mountain burnt out most terribly and threw out Fire in so large a quantity that it destroyed many Towns and Villages with many Fields of Maiz or  Indian  Corn and that the  Mexican  Priests foretold by this unusual Accident that their Kingdom should be lost to strangers who were contrary to them both in Religion Colour Habit and Customs But since the coming of the  Spaniards  I have not heard of its doing any hurt This Vulcan lies in the Latitude of d m N and we found variation near it d m Westerly  From this Vulcan of  Sapotittlan  to the Vulcan of  Sacatepeque  is six Leagues This Vulcan is in form almost like to a Beehive  It is a very great Mountain and throws out vast quantities of Fire so that this is and the other formerly has been accounted the wonder of this part of the World To the Eastward of the Eastermost of these two Vulcans is a River of good fresh Water called by the same Name but hard to come at because there runs so great a Sea and besides here is no Port to go in with a Ship  From the Vulcan of  Sacatepeque  to the Vulcan of  Attitlan  is seven Leagues The Coast runs N W and S E This is a very large Mountain commonly casting out Smoke It lies in the Latitude of d m N and we found variation off it d Westerly A little to the S E of the said Vulcan is a River of the same name and upon the Banks of the River are said to be several pretty little  Indian  Towns about which are several Gardens of several sorts of Fruits with several Plantations of Maiz and many Walks of Cocoas  From this River of  Attitlan  to the River of  Anabaces  is four Leagues Between which two Rivers the Land is not very high And by the Seaside are a great many Cocoanutwalks but the Sea falls with such great force upon the Shore that there is no landing with a Boat to get them  From the River of  Anabaces  to the fiery Vulcan of  Guatimala  is eight Leagues The Coast continues still to stretch away N W and S E This Vulcan of  Guatimala  commonly throws out Fire but mostly in the rainy Season which is from the latter end of  April  to the beginning of  October  For the Rain then falling on it makes it burn the fiercer Behind this Vulcan is said to be the great City of  Guatimala  which consists of Families besides the Suburbs called  St Domingo  in which may be about Families more besides innumerable of  Mullattoes Mostese  and  Indians  It is accounted next to  Lima  and  Mexico  to be the biggest and best traded City in all  America  It is govern'd by a President who in his own Territories is as great as the ViceRoys of  Peru  and  Mexico  and is not subordinate to either of Them but only to the Council of  Spain  The Natives of this place are very expert in Featherwork They will make either Fish Fowl or Beast Flowers Trees Herbs and Roots to admiration nay they will for a whole Day eat nothing only to place one Feather in its due Perfection turning and tossing the Feather to the light of the Sun and then in the Shade to see in which it looks best and so accordingly place it At this place groweth abundance of Cocoa  Beef Mutton and Veal is here so cheap that for a Ryal which is seven pence halfpenny one may buy Pounds This famous City has been twice destroy'd by two dreadful Mountains which stand near it the one being of Water which drowned it and the other of Fire which formerly burnt it but now the  Spaniards  have removed the City three leagues further off where they now live without fear of the two Vulcans although as I said before that of Fire continually burns all the Winter but without doing them damage because the City is so far off Off these two Vulcans we took a Bark of about eighty Tuns in her Ballast nam'd the St  John  From the fiery Vulcan to the River of  Ystapa  is eight leagues In it is a small Village of  Indians  who are most of them Slaves to the  Spaniards  of  Guatimala  The Coast here runs N W and S E The River  Ystapa  bears with the Mountains of  Guatimala  N W and S E You may know where the River is by this following Sign In the middle overagainst the highest part of the Trees is the Bar and it lies South East from the Mountains of  Guatimala  Take them upon what Point of the Compass you please they will always appear in a Triangle  From the River of  Ystapa  to the River of  Monticalco de los esclavos  or the  River of Slaves  is thirteen leagues This River is much pestered with North Winds To know the River you must observe there are on the SeaCoast some little high Mounts In the Bar there are no Trees any further than half a league distance on each side But all this Part of the Coast except it be near the Bar is full of Trees Along the SeaCoast from  Guatimala  to this place is all good Anchorground and safe anchoring  From the River  Monticalco  to the Point of  Remidias  alias  Sonsonate  alias  Trinidad  is thirteen leagues The Point of  Remidias  is low Land and there is a tract of Shoals that come above a league from it into the Sea take heed of them The best anchoring is in twelve fathom Water right off the River which is the Port of  Sonsonate  See Fig XXIV  This  Sonsonate  is one of the greatest places of Trade on the Coast of  Mexico  It lies in the Latitude of d m North This famous place leads to a Country as populous as any in  America  At the Seaside are said to be thirty Houses most Warehouses And it is govern'd by a  Teniente  under the Governour of  Trinidad  From this Port to the City of  Trinidad  is six leagues It is said to have five  Parish Churches with between four and five hundred  Spanish  Families In each Parish are spacious Walks and Gardens of Pleasure all very artificially made Along the Coast is very high Land When you are right off the Port of  Sonsonate  you will have the Valley of  Salvadore  open where stands a Church and a small Town called  Guagamoco  The chief Commodity along this Coast is Cocoa There is some trading from  Mexico  to this place and from Port  Cavalles  in the North Sea but the most and greatest Trade they have is from the two great Empires of  Peru  and  Chili  From Point  Remidias  to the Vulcan of  Isalco  is three leagues This Vulcan at certain times smoaks very much and about it are great heaps of Ashes You may know it by its being situated amongst a great many high Mountains that are higher than it and you may see them from the end of the Deserts of  Balsamo  From this Vulcan begin the Mountains of  Morcois  Although it has abundance of smoak issuing out of it yet I never heard that it cast out any thing else  From this Vulcan of  Isalco  to the Vulcan of St  Salvadore  is five Leagues The appearance of it is like unto a Turks Turbant Between the two said Vulcans close by the Seaside is the  Barnadillo  which is a high steep Rock on one side appearing like a Pyramid And midway between the  Barnadillo  and the Vulcan of St  Salvadore  is a fresh Water River whose Banks are very well peopled with  Indians  From the Vulcan of  St Salvadore  to the great Vulcan of  Sacatelepa  is six leagues This Vulcan stands near the Seaside In the Year it was said to burst out throwing out Sulphur and Ashes which stopt the ways and spoiled several Fields of Corn  From hence to the great River of  Lempa  is one league That River has a great many Sands at the Mouth but they are visible so that you may steer in amongst them without any danger It is one of the biggest if not the biggest on the Westside of the Empire of  Mexico  It is also said by the  Spaniards  to be a priviledged River so that a Man who hath committed Murther or any other Crime worthy of Death or Imprisonment if he can make his escape to the other side he is free so long as he liveth there and no Justice or any Other on that side can question or any way trouble him for the said Crime At this River  Lempa  begins the pleasant Country of  St Michaels  The Town of  St Michaels  is a large Town said to consist of eight hundred  Spanish  Families and hath seven fair and  very rich Churches in it with several small Chapels And behind a great Vulcan called the Vulcan of  St Michaels  is a great  Lagune  whose Borders are very well peopled with a mixture of  Spaniards Mullattoes Mostese  and  Indians  In a place here called the  Red Creek  are said to be built Ships of Tuns This Country is very plentiful of all Necessaries The Earth brings forth Corn Wine and Oil almost without Man's help At the Mouth of the River of  St Michael  on the Banks of which the Town is situated you will at low water have two fathom In going in the  Spaniards  always keep the Vulcan due North And then there is no danger It was from this Vulcan that we took our departure when we quitted these parts to proceed on our Voyage for  India  Over the River of  St Michaels  the  Spaniards  have built a wooden Bridge The Coast still continues to run North East and South West  Near to the Vulcan of St  Michaels  is the Gulf of  Amapalla  This Gulf is eight or nine leagues deep and four wide At its Mouth are two large Islands the one called  Amapalla  and the other  Mangera  and within is the Island  Conchagua  at which we wooded and watered our Bark at our going to  India  There are a great many other Islands in the Gulf but none of  them inhabited except  Mangera  and  Amapalla Amapalla  is the biggest and on it is a small  Indian  Town or two of the same Name There are two entrances into this Gulf the one between Point  Casivina  and the Island  Mangera  and the other between the Island  Mangera  and the Island of  Amapalla  But that between Point  Casivina  and the Island  Mangera  has the deepest Water yet it is better going in at the other because with the Seawind you can run in at once The nearer you come to any of these Islands you will find the Water the deeper For the Gulf is mostly shallow Water And we were forced to keep the Lead going At our coming out in our Bark between  Amapalla  and  Mangera  we had often not above two fathom Water The chief Town of  Amapalla  is mightily increased of late For in it there is now said to be above a hundred  Spanish  Houses It hath a great Traffick for its Cochineel Cocoa Hides Indico and all sorts of Provisions It is govern'd by a  Teniente  under the President of  Guatimala  There is another Village at the bottom of the Gulf called  Chuluteca  In it are about thirty or forty  Indian  Houses with not above two or three  Spaniards  amongst them They live by selling Provisions which they truck for other Commodities But these  two or three  Spaniards  will not suffer the poor  Indians  to trade for themselves saying that Strangers will cheat them and fail not to do it themselves of three fourths of what they are entrusted with Were it not for these unlawful shifts the lazy  Spaniards  would not grow so rich as they do Here are a great many Sands Rivers and Shoals in this Gulf and the chief place of anchoring for the  Spanish  Ships is on the N E side of the Island of  Amapalla  in nine ten and eleven fathom  See Fig XXV  Although we anchored at the Island  Conchagua  The Island of  Amapalla  makes the West as Point  Casivina  does the East point of the Gulf The Point  Casivina  is a high rocky Point which at a distance looks like an Island It lies in the Latitude of d N and I reckon Longitude from  London  West d m We found here d m westerly variation The water we found to rise and fall nine Foot and it is very full of Worms At this place we caught several sorts of Fish but the most remarkable was the  Shovelnos'dShark  and a Fish by the  Indians  called a  Ceawau  The  Shovelnos'dShark  is in all respects the same as the common one Only his Head is like a Colliers Shovel and the two extreme parts at the edge of which on each side are his Eyes go a great deal  map of part of Mexico  Fig XXV  PART OF MEXICO  broader out than his Body Besides they have no Stones in their Heads as the common Shark has But they are both alike ravenous  The  Ceawau  See Fig XXVI  was a Fish of about four Foot long He had three Fins on his Back  viz  one small one at the hinderpart of his Head a great one near the middle of his Back and another small one towards his Tail He had also two small ones underneath near the Gills and two small ones underneath near the Tail with two pretty large ones on each side near the Gills He had a large Mouth and Teeth He was an extraordinary good Fish and his Head when boiled was nothing but a pure good Jelly He was full of small Spots and Partings as is express'd in the Figure And the tip of his Fins and Tail was Yellow  From the Point of  Casivina  to the  Messa de Roldon  or the Hill of  Roldon  is leagues It is a plain Hill and at the top is a Table near which is the Port of  Martin Lopez  a fine Port but very seldom made use of for want of Trade It is a very noted place having on the top of it a great many white Clifts  From this Port to the South East distance four leagues is the Port of  Ria Lexa  by some called  Rio Leon  It is a good and safe Port from all Winds If  you would enter this Port keep the largest of the two Islands on the Larboard side This Island which you must leave on the Larboard side is all Savannah And when you are within it bear off from the Land on the Starboard side for from the Main come many dangerous Sholes Then sail directly to the Anchoringplace which is right against a small River on the said Island and is three leagues before you come to the River At the Anchoringplace the Harbour is pretty broad but from thence it turns away to the West and grows narrower till you come to the Town which is situated upon the River  Lexa  or  Leon  It is said to consist of about eight hundred and fifty Families being a mixture of  Spaniards Mullattoes Mostcse  and  Indians  The Houses are said to be very well built of Brick and Stone and that it hath five or six large Churches in it As you come from Sea the Mouth of this Port is hard to be seen but look to the Vulcan of  Vejo  and steer towards it and you will see a Point and near it a Rock which is as high as a Ship Make towards that Rock and you will see a rising until you open the Mouth whose entry is at the North West part and the Vulcan in the Harbour lies East When you are in you will find it all low Land except the Vulcan of  Vejo  which is a very great and high Vulcan  depiction of ceawau  Fig  A Ceawau  depiction of yellow tail  ig  The Yellow Tayle  depiction of island of Magon  Fig

Fig  The form of y  e  Indian  Proe  w  th  its outleaker  commonly throwing out Smoke It is a very noted Mountain and may be known a great many leagues off there being none that I have seen like it on all the Coast of  Mexico  This Port of  Ria Lexa  is a place of great Trade from most parts of  Peru  and  Mexico  and is seldom or never without Shipping In it they build small Vessels and some Ships of Tuns This famous Port lies in the Latitude of about d m N Longitude from  London  d m and we found variation d m westerly The Islands are very low so that every Tide they are overflown And upon this low and swampy Land are abundance of MangroveTrees Within Land they make a great deal of Pitch Tar and Cordage of which they send great quantities by shipping and supply most of these Western parts of  Mexico Peru  and  Chili  From the Port of  Ria Lexa  to the River  de Tosta  is three leagues This River is sometimes dry but if it were not yet the Sea runs so high and falls with such force upon the Shore that there is no landing near it  From hence to  Messa de Sutaba  or the Mountains  Sutaba  is six leagues all high Land on which falls a great Sea It is also a very windy Coast and runs N W b W and S E b E  From the Mountains of  Sutaba  to the great Vulcan of  Telica  is four leagues This Vulcan is a great deal higher than all the Mountains near it and it continually throws out many Stones and smokes very much It is a very windy and hard Coast and no Port near it  From the Vulcan of  Telica  to the Vulcan of  Leon Mamotombo  is six leagues This Vulcan formerly burst out at the top with Fire and was said to do much hurt to all the Country for nine or ten Miles round but it has ceased since and suffers the Inhabitants to live in peace altho' sometimes it will smoak all the sulphurous Matter being not quite exhausted The  Spaniards  tell a Story of a  Spanish  Friar who thought to have discovered some Treasure within this Vulcan which might enrich himself and all the Country he being possest in his own Mind that the stuff which burned within this Mount was Gold whereupon he caused a great IronKettle to be made and hung it to an IronChain and let it down thinking to draw up Gold enough to buy him a Bishoprick but such was the power and great heat of the Fire within that he had no sooner let it down but both Kettle and Chain melted away and so frustrated the poor Friar of his hoped for Bishoprick Beyond this Vulcan more within Land is  s  ituated the City of  Leon  from which the Vulcan took its Name The  Spaniards  say there are eleven Churches in it and about a Thousand Houses well built with many good Gardens and Orchards in which are many fine Waterworks in the shapes of Birds Beasts and Fowls The Inhabitants are said to be very rich driving a great Trade both by the North and South Seas It is ruled by a Governour who is not subordinate to any but the Viceroy of  Mexico  and the Council of  Spain  From this Vulcan of  Leon  to the Mountain of  Martiare  is two leagues This Mountain is very plain and has a Table on the top At the West end of it is a fine small Cove and at the bottom of the Cove a River of fresh Water but here falls so great a Sea upon the shore that there is no landing  From the Mountain of  Martiare  to the Port of St  John  is five leagues In this Port they commonly build small Vessels but here often runs so great a Sea that no Boat can go ashore unless by chance This is a pretty good Port and in it you are defended from the N W and other Northerly Winds At the East point of this Port lie four small Islands or rather Rocks which make a good defence for the Port against S E Winds and at the bottom of the Port in the middle is a River of fresh Water  From hence to the Point of St  Catharine  is fifteen leagues And between them is the Gulf of  Popogajo  an ill place to go ashore in and worse to ride in being very windy but especially from  April  to the latter end of  September  which is the time for the North Winds From this Gulf you will see within Land the great Vulcan of  Granada  and near the Seaside stands the Vulcan of  Bombacho  both casting out much smoak They are two noted Vulcans That of  Granada  up in the Country is in form of a BeeHive the other of  Bombacho  which stands near the Seaside hath three high Peeks on the top of it In the middle of the Gulf is a River of fresh Water but the Sea falls with so great force upon the Shore that there is no landing near it And in the middle of the Gulf by the Seaside the Land is low till you come to the great Mountain of  Popogajo  which is a vast high Mountain and is in form of a Sugarloaf It is called  Popogajo  from the abundance of Parrots that continually resort about it This Mountain stands upon the Point of St  Catharine  which is low Land and off it lie two Rocks or small Islands  From these Rocks or small Islands to the Port of  Velas  is nine leagues The Coast runs N N W and S S E About  three leagues to the S E of the Point of St  Catharine  are two Rocks more which are of a whitish Colour And from thence to the S E distance two leagues is a River of fresh Water called the River of  Velas  but at the Mouth of it are several Sands and Shoals At this River to the South Eastward the Land begins to be mountainous In the Port of  Velas  is the Vulcan of  Zapanzas  and in the East part of the Port near the Port are many Sands stretching from the shore for a mile At the bottom of the Port which is at the S E end is a good fresh Water River at which you may water your Ship if occasion be And right off the said River is the anchoring place To the West of the anchoring place is a bluff Point stretching out into the Sea and about this Point are a great many Shoals and Rocks with foul Ground which stretch near three leagues into the Sea Come not near them for they are very dangerous These Rocks are called  Velas  because at a distance they look like a Ship under Sail  From these Rocks to the Mount of  Hermozo  is seven leagues S S E This  Hermozo  is a high Hill but higher at the West than East end It runs out butting into the Sea and from thence grows higher and higher within Land At this  Mount of  Hermozo  you may see the Port of  Velas  And between these two places is a little high Island which is two leagues from the shoar Whether there be any sailing for a Ship between it and the Main I know not  From the Mount of  Hermozo  to the Cape of  Gajones  is eight Leagues The Coast runs S E by E and N W by W all along mountainous and very bad and rocky and no port for any Ship to anchor in The Cape of  Gajones  is a very noted Cape It is not altogether so high as the Mount of  Hermozo  but on the top it is very even and plain It goes down on the West with a bending like a Saddle which joins it to the Mount of  Hermoso  and also on the East it bends down in like manner and is joined to another Mountain which Mountain is plain and even on the top and in all respects looks like the Cape of  Gajones  only the Cape of  Gajones  is something fuller of Trees and to know them from each other you must note that the Westermost of the said two even Mountains is the Cape  From the Cape of  Gajones  to Cape  Blanco  is twelve leagues In the way are two dangerous Shoals they lie distant from the Main about one league and at low Water may be seen almost dry Between the two aforesaid Capes is a small  Bay called the Bay of  Caldera  Your best anchoring is at the Northpart of it at which place you may see the River of  Sparca  distant about half a league at which is said to be excellent good wooding and watering and upon the Banks of the River are situated several small  Indian  Towns and Villages Cape  Blanco  or  White Cape  is the Westermost Point of the Gulf of  Nicoya  as the  Herradura  is the East The Cape lies in the Latitude of d m North To the N W of it lie three small low Islands distant from it about a league The Cape is high Land but higher within Land than near the Waterside It is very full of tall Trees of several sorts and at the pitch of the Cape is a small Island very full of Trees The Land is of a whitish Colour perhaps occasioned by the Dung of Fowls of which there are a great many that resort thither as they do to all the Islands in the Gulf This Island at a distance looks as if it joined to the Cape and it being of a whitish Colour as I said before gives name to the Cape From this Cape  Blanco  Northward along the Coast of  Mexico  until you come to the Gulf of  Amapalla  many times for two or three days together you will meet with hard Gales of Wind from the Land which are called  Popagajos  These Winds are very frequent in the  Months of  May June July  and  August  which is the worst of the bad Weather Monsoon or Winter time here  From Cape  Blanco  to the  Herradura  is nine Leagues between which is the Gulf of  Nicoya  It is a place much used by the  Spaniards  Captain  Sharp  in this place in the River  De la despenza  took some  Spanish  Carpenters who were building a Ship and brought them to the Island  Chira  with all their Tools on board of his own Ship where they refitted her and in the River  Tempisque  they took two Barks laden with Tallow In this same Gulf in the Year near the Island  Saint Lucas  we took a Bark of about forty Tuns She had on board some Wine Brandy and Sugar with five or six  Indian  Carpenters and Caulkers who came in a good time to help us to clean our Ship and to refit her if we had plank to do it with At a heap of small Islands lying in the middle of the Gulf called the  Middle Islands  we hauled our Ship ashore as has been before related and cleaned her as well as we could We found the Water here at Nepetides to rise and fall eight foot at Springtides more We lay here about two Months and refitted wooded and watered our Ship Near the Cape is a small Village of  Indians  and before the Village are a great many Sands  map of part of Mexico  Fig XXVII  PART of MEXICO  Rocks and Shoals so that it is very difficult landing near it but not far of are two good anchoring places On the other side of the Gulf almost right against this Village is the little Bay called the Bay of  Caldera  and right over the Bay is a plain even Land called the Table of  Macotela  near to which are two or three poor  Indian  Fishermens Houses All Ships bound for  Nicoya  anchor at the Island of  Chira  See Fig XXVII  from whence the Town of  Nicoya  is distant about ten Leagues consisting of about seventy or eighty Houses being a mixture of  Spaniards  and  Indians  This is said to be a pretty well compacted Town and Head of a  Spanish  Government It is governed by an Alcade or Mayor From it come Fowls Salt Honey and other Provisions which they yearly send to  Panama  in small Vessels The  Nicoyans  are a People of a middle Stature and tawny Complexion Before  he coming of the  Spaniards  they had very good Laws among themselves only  hey had no Law against a Man's killing  is Father Mother or King They as I  uppose thinking no Man would or could  e so very wicked as to murder either his  wn Parents or the common Father of  em all whom they used to adore as a God A Thief they judged not to die  ut to be made a Slave to the Man he  robs till by his Service he has made Satisfaction This Gulf is very much infested with Worms To some of these Islands the  Spaniards  frequently come to fish for Pearl of which they often make very profitable Voyages Here are also vast numbers of extraordinary good Seaturtle And up most of the Rivers of which here are a great many are several good Plantainwalks at which we got store of Plantains In the Island of  Chira  which lyes at the bottom of this Gulf of  Nicoya  and which as I said before is the common anchoring place for the  Spanish  Ships which trade to  Nicoya  is a small Village of  Indians  of about thirteen or fourteen Houses built of Palmeto Leaves Here Captain  Sharp  formerly filled his Water in a Pond near the Seaside And here the poor  Indians  related to them the sad usage they met with from their cruel Masters the  Spaniards  who make them work for them because they have nothing to pay them tribute with They have a small Chapel here and here they used formerly to make a great many Earthen Jars but now the  Indians  are most of them run away to get free from their cruel Masters the  Spaniards  In this Gulf are Seaturtle and Fish of several sorts Of Birds here are the Pelican the Carrioncrow and the Maccaw Birds of  which I have already given a Description  From the  Herradura  which makes the Eastpoint of this Gulf of  Nicoya  to the River  Estrella  or StarRiver is eleven Leagues The Coast runs N W by W and S E by E the Land something mountainous and steep Near this River are the  Sierras de los Coronados  or the Crowned Mountains These are very noted Mountains so that there is none like them on all the Coast They are five or six Ridges of Mountains each gradually surmounting the other and those within the Land are highest At the West end of these Mountains are four Rocks called by the  Spaniards Farallones de Queipo  You may sail between them and the Main and there is deep Water enough These Rocks are bare having no Trees or Bushes on them  From hence to the Island  Caneo  is four Leagues This Island is a League round and indifferent high Land well clothed with streight and tall Trees It lies in the Latitude of d N The anchoring place is on the N E side in fourteen fathom Water a quarter of a Mile off the shore where you may wood and water Upon this Island are said to be some few wild Hogs but for what purpose they were first set ashore here I know not  For the Island is uninhabited There ar  several small Islands and shoals which ly  about it towards the North and West and to the N E by E is  Punta mala  o  bad Point and within this  Punta mala  i  a deep and fine Bay wherein Sir  Thoma  Cavendish  formerly cleaned his Ship The shore is full of Shoals therefore keep a good League off it  Punta mala  is low and from it there stretch out several Sands and Shoals and in the middle of the Sands is a small Island which at a distance shows like a Ship under sail It is an even Country but very woody and in the Woods are said to be store of Deer The Coast runs N W by W and S E by E  From  Punta mala  to the  Golfo Dulce  or sweet Gulf is nine Leagues the Land pretty even and woody Within this Gulf is a very good Harbour and the Water is very smooth This is accounted as good a Gulf to ride in as the Gulf of  Nicoya  and in it you are secure from all Winds nay even from the  Spaniards  themselves for the SeaCoast is clear of them but here are  Indians  who are very friendly to the  English  They are but few and live here to shun the  Spaniards  Yet they are obliged to pay half the Fish they catch to the Fryar of a Town which is four Leagues up in the  Country They have here store of Honey Plantains and Cassavyroot Here are two Rivers at the bottom of this Gulf where there is good wooding and watering and here is good laying a Ship a ground to clean for the Water rises and and falls nine or ten Foot at Springtides The Country is mountainous and very woody and here are a great many Walks of Plantains and Coconuts and in the Woods are store of wild Deer At the Westentrance of this Gulf are two Rocks from which to the Point of  Burica  is five Leagues This is a low Point running into the Sea From the Southward it shows like two Islands It is shoal a good way off therefore with a great Ship keep a good League and half off shore This Point is full of Coconuttrees Right off it distance about a League and half is a Rock and there is no going between it and the said Point To the Eastward of the Point of  Burica  which lyes in the Latitude of d m N the Land makes a long and deep Bay in which are a great many Islands Rivers Rocks Shoals and Sands but the most noted is the River of  Chirique  which lyes in the middle and bottom of the Bay and on the Banks of which is situated a  Spanish  Town of the same Name with the River In it are about fifty Houses built of Brick  and covered with Palmetoleaves You may see hence within the Land a Hill called  Barn  at whose Foot is another small Town of about forty or fifty Houses The Trade here is mostly for  Muntego  Butter Indigo Pitch Tarr and Provisions of all sorts which is the common Trade of all this Coast The River of  Chirique  is seldom without Shipping which bring Trade to it from the City of  Panama  and other places in the Country It is said to be very well people with  Spaniards Mullattoes Mostese  and  Indians  And in the Woods is said to be plenty of Beeves Deer and wild Hogs The most noted Island in this Bay is the Island of  Montuosa  This Island is round and high and near it are two Rocks called the  Ladrones  They are distant from each other three quarters of a Mile And at the South end of the Island is a Shoal of Sand which runs a Mile into the Sea Further in the Bay are several other Towns Villages Rivers and Islands Particularly the Town of  Puebla Nova  or the Newtown although now it is of an old standing which is three Leagues from the Seaside up a River of the same Name in which Ships are said to ride in four fathom VVater not above half a Mile from the Town VVithin the Mouth of this River on the Larboard side going in is a Rock called  Silva  from the continual Noise it makes in the Night like Musick But here Captain  Sawkins  formerly paid the Piper For going ashore to take the Town of  Puebla Nova  he was killed by an Ambuscade of the  Spaniards  at which they are very dextrous and had rather fight so lurking amongst Trees and Bushes than face their Enemy in open Field unless they happen to be fifteen or twenty to one and then they will face you bravely in the open Field This Coast is famous for Pearlfishing For at most of these Islands are built Huts on purpose for the Fishers who are  Indians  and are Servants to the  Spaniards  that live upon the Main Not far from them the Main is woody and full of wild Deer who are not easily scared Also here are a great many Turtle who are very large fat and sweet Here are also abundance of Fish which are extraordinary good  Not far from hence is the Island of  Quibo  This Island lies in the Latitude of d m North At it are a great many Turtle The Island is pretty low but stored with several sorts of Medicinal Herbs called by the  Spaniards Herba Maria  The Island is all round full of large and tall Trees and upon it in several places is to be found very good Water There is good anchoring at this Island in ten and twelve fathom  Water not above half a mile from the Shore At this Island they fell a great deal of Timber with which they build small Vessels accounted the best in these Parts  Off the Southpoint of this Island lyeth another Island called  Quicara  It bears S S W from  Quibo  distance one league Between these two Islands is a very good Channel through which you may pass securely without any danger and come to an anchor in  Quicara  Road which lyeth in a Bay On the N E part of thi  Bay is pretty deep Water and in the middle of it cometh a River overagainst a Rock near to which Rock is twenty fa+thom Water If you please to go ashore with your Boat to get Wood Water and Coconuts you must go between the Rock and the Point which will defend you from the S S W Winds  On the Northpart of the Island o  Quibo  is the Island  Rancheria  which is a small but very woody Island and th  Trees which grow on it are said to b  very good for Masts which use the  Spani+ards  often put them to There are a grea  many Islands more hereabouts with seve+ral good Ports and Rivers that you ma  enter with a Ship of six hundred Tun  The Bay is full of Islands and no dange  in any of them but what is visible Th  Coast is all secure only you will find great and uncertain Currents occasioned by the many Bays Islands and Rivers in it And most of these Islands are very well clothed with tall Trees and afford very good Water  From Point  Canales  to Point  Mariato  the Land makes another Bay in which are also a great many Islands and Rivers which have several of them large Sholes stretching from them into the Sea Between these two Points is an Island called the  Govanadore  On it is said to be good Wood and Water and here are some  Negroes  who are Slaves to the  Spaniards  that come hither to cut Timber of which here is good store This is a small round Island and hath at its West Point a Shole of Sand which runneth into the Sea about a Mile  A little to the Northward of this Island of  Govanadore  and further into the Bay is another Island called the  Leones  in which is good Wood and Water It is a much larger Island than the Island of  Govanadore  and has a Shole of Sand quite round the Eastside of it There is a Channel between these two Islands but when you go through take care that you keep the Lead going and have a care of the East Point of  Leones  and the West Point of  Govanadore  Here are a great many other Islands  Rivers and Rocks but none of any note till you come to the Point of  Mariato  neither is there any or but very little Trade here by shipping  The Point of  Mariato  is high Land and near it are the Mountains of  Guarco  which are very high Mountains and very woody and amongst these Mountains is the  Moro de Porcos  or the Mountain of Hogs It is a high round Hill as high as any of the Mountains of  Guarco  There are great store of Hogs which run wild up and down these Mountains from whence I suppose this Mount of  Porcos  took its Name  From the Point of  Mariato  to the Point of  Higuera  is eighteen leagues the Coast running East and West In all which distance it is clear and good Anchorground Two leagues to the Westward of Point  Higuera  is the Mount of  Porcos  and right against it is a fine Bay at the entrance of which on the Eastside is a shole of Sand and in the midst of the shole is a little Rock Take heed how you come near it On the other side at the West Point of the said Bay is a small Island near which is the best Anchorground And at the bottom of the Bay is a River of fresh Water  From the Point of  Higuera  to  Puntamala  is fourteen leagues The Coast runs  W S W and E N E Between these Points are two Rocks called the  Two Friars  You may sail safely between them and the Main Land or in the Channel between them both or without them both according as you think fit Here are several small Rivers of no great note or use as the River  Cascajales  the River  Oria  and several others Upon  Puntamala  is a small Village of  Indians  and  Spaniards  called the  Village of Captain Luis del Gado  This  Puntamala  is certainly very justly so named Do not by any means come near it with your Ship for it hath an innumerable company of Rocks and Sholes that stretch out above a league into the Sea Near this Point are kept a great many Farms of Beeves  A little to the Northward of this bad Point is the Island  Guanoes  which has a very good anchoringplace on the NorthEast side next the Main Land in eighteen fathom water in a sandy Bay where you are defended from most VVinds The Island is not very high and it is well clothed with many tall Trees and on it is very good water Right over against it on the Main are several sorts of Provisions to be had as Beef Pork Bread Flower  c  if you are strong enough to take it And if you have a mind to lay your Ship ashore to clean the Island  Guanoes  is a good place  From this Island to the Town of  Nata  is fourteen Leagues the Land pretty low by the Seaside with several Rivers but the chief next to that of  Nata  is the River of  Saints  on the Banks of which is situated a Village of the same name called by the  Spaniards Villa de los Santos  It is a small Village of not above eighteen or twenty Houses mostly  Indians  Why it is called the  Village of Saints  I know not About seven leagues from this  Village of Saints  is the Town of  Nata  between which two places are four or five small Rivers and abundance of Sholes near the main Land The Town of  Nata  is a large and wellcompacted Town situated upon the Banks of a River of the same Name It has great trade with  Panama  selling them Provisions as Cows Hogs Fowls Maiz  c  Here are several other Towns of note But though they are as great and populous as  Nata  yet they have not any of them so many white Men for the mixt Blood is so spread that for one White here are a hundred Blacks and Mullattoes who are of a yellow colour between black and white  From  Nata  the Coast stretches in Mountains and Hills and the water is so shole that there is scarce any coming in for a Ship but if there were here is never a Port Although it is high and mountainous  in the Country yet by the waterside the Land is not very high Between the Town of  Nata  and the Point  de Chaine  are several Rivers and behind the Hills is a Valley called  Sapo  from whence they fetch Hogs and Fowls for the City of  Panama  as they do from most places hereabouts Along this Coast Ships ought to keep two or three Leagues off Shore or else they will meet with broken Ground and sunk Rocks But the Coast has many freshwater Rivers full of several sorts of very good Fish which the  Indians  catch and send several Leagues round Fishing being an Employ peculiar to these  Indians  though it rewards them but very slenderly because they pay such great Customs out of it to the  Spaniards  CHAP VI  A

Continent of  America  It is said to have eight Parish Churches thirty small Chappels and to contain six Thousand and five Hundred Houses most of them well built of Brick and Stone It is very well fortified and walled all round with Stone The City is governed by a President under the Viceroy of  Peru  it being part of his Territories On the backside of the City is a very pleasant and fruitful Country The Land is not very high but full of small Hills and fine pleasant Valleys in which there are several fine Gardens of several sorts of Fruit This is a place of the greatest Trade of any in the South  Seas not excepting even  Lima  the Metropolis For this City has the conveniency of Trade both from the North and South Sea From the North Sea it receives all or most of the  European  Goods which are brought by the  Spaniards  to  Portobel  or  Carthagena  or by any other Nation trading on the Northside And these  European  Goods are from hence by shipping in the South Sea sent to  Guiaquill Truxillo Lima Arica Coquimbo Govanadore Valpirizo  and  Valdivia  with several other noted places from whence they return back richly laden with the Commodities of these Parts But now the  French  having a trade amongst them and supplying them with all  European  Necessaries it hinders this City mightily and the  Spaniards  as far as we could hear whilst we were in these Parts had rather have their room than their Company However the  French  at present make very great and profitable Voyages and now that they find the sweet of it they will be sure if they can to settle a firm and lasting Trade here For as we have been assured by several  Spanish  Captains whom we took they have made better than  per Cent  of their Goods one with another This City stood formerly four Miles to the Eastward of the place where it now stands But it being taken and kept a Month by  Sir  Henry Morgan  and by misfortune burnt three times since they thought the place unlucky and so built it by the Seaside where it now stands It is now much larger stronger and better built than it was before The Port of  Perica  is the Harbour for  Panama  but distant from it three Miles For the great ebbing and shoalness of the Water will not suffer any great Ship to come any nearer than the said Island of  Perica  which is far out of Command of their Guns at  Panama  Therefore shipping may easily be taken out But although great Ships are forced to lie here yet small Vessels run through a little Creek close up to the City  From  Panama  to the Island  Tabago  is between five and six Leagues and they bear nearly North and South from each other This Island of  Tabago  is in length one league in breadth about half a league The Island is high and mountainous but highest at the South end It is very well clothed with Trees of several sorts and on it are several Walks of  Plantains Bonanoes Coconuts  c which they send to sell at  Panama  Upon this Island on the Northside is a small Village of thatcht Houses inhabited by  Negroes  who are Slaves to the Gentlemen at  Panama  and are kept here on purpose to look after their  Walks of Fruit Right against the said small Village is the common anchoring place in which there is tolerable good anchoring in seventeen or eighteen fathom Water There are two other small Islands just by it They are both very well clothed wth Woods aad on them are some few  Negroes  as there is upon most or all of these Islands in the Bay of  Panama  To the South East of these  Islands  is a great range of Islands called the  Kings Islands  they are most of them pretty low and pleasant Islands and very well clothed with tall streight Trees of several sorts About them are a great many very good anchoring places and upon most of them is good Wood Water and Fruit They are in all about forty in number On the great Island called the  Kings Island  which gives name to all the rest the  Spaniards  build good Vessels which are commonly counted pretty good Sailers You must observe that amongst these Islands you will hardly find much more or less than sixty fathom Water unless you are very near them Amongst these Islands the Water rises and falls ten foot perpendicular  From  Panama  to the Island  Chepelio  is eight Leagues Upon this Island are some  Mullattoes  and  Negroes  belonging to the  Gentlemen of  Panama  The Island is mostly planted with Rice as are a great many of the  Kings Islands  which are about ten Leagues distance from hence Right against this Island on the Main is a large River called  Cheapo  and seven Leagues up the said River is a Town of the same Name which is very plentiful of Provisions  From  Chepelio  to the Island of  Planta  is seven leagues It lies a league from the Main and the water about it is indifferently deep but near the Main it is all along shole water not above four Foot though you be a league from the shore  From hence to  Cape Saint Lorenzo  is ten leagues This Cape is low Land full of Creeks and near it is shole water At this Cape begins the Gulf of St  Michael  in which are a great many Islands Rivers and Sholes although in some places the Water is deep and smooth and good anchoring It was up one of these Rivers that we went designing to take the Town of  Santa Maria  but were frustrated of our intent Yet we took an  Indian  Town which we called  Scuchadero  It was about three leagues within the Mouth of the River and situated on the Southside of it In it we found store of DunghilFowls Parrots white and black Beans Yams Potatoes Maiz  c  It consisted of about  two hundred and fifty Houses and round about the Town were great Walks of Fruit as Plantains Bonanoes  c  There is another Town on the Northside of the River called  Scuchadero  which Captain  Dampier  mentions in his First Vol  p  But this we could not find and so gave the other Town its name and from thence returned on board our Ships again which we left lying at Point  Garachina  which Point I make to lie in the Latitude of d m North The Tide runs here five Knots and a half  per  hour It rises and falls three Fathom and ebbs and flows N E and S W  From Point  Garachina  to Port  Pinas  is seven leagues North and South The Port of  Pinas  has two small Islands at the Mouth of it But if you please you may sail close by them for there is no danger neither is there less than twelve or fourteen Fathom water At this place is good wooding and watering The Land is high and very woody and goes up hollow in the middle It is very full of PineTrees and thence called Port  Pinas  In some part of this Port is good anchoring and in the Port are three Rivers of fresh water and the Banks of the Rivers are full of tall streight Trees The Port lies in the Latitude of d North Longitude from  London  West d m And a  little to the Southward of this Port are five or six small Rocks  From Port  Pinas  to Port  Quemado  is twentyfive Leagues At its Mouth are several Rocks and Islands and along this Coast are several good Harbours The Land here is not so high as at Port  Pinas  but in many places here are very pleasant Walks of Coconuts The Coast is very deep and dangerous in Wintertime At the bottom of Port  Quemado  are two Rivers of fresh water and at the entrance of the Port both on the North and South side are several small Islands or rather Rocks Keep midway between both Points and you may go in very securely But this is no very secure Port and seldom or ever made use of  A little to the Southward of this Port of  Quemado  is the Port of  Santa Clara  Off this Port lie four Rocks and in the middle of it is a small River It is but a bad Port lying open to the South West and other Southerly Winds which in the Winter time blow very hard here This Port lies in the Latitude of six Degrees North  From Port St  Clara  to the Bay of Saint  Antonio  is five leagues all very low Land which in the rainy time is covered with water only the tops of the Trees to be seen Along the shore are a great many small Islands Rocks and Sholes Therefore  be sure keep without them for they are very dangerous In the little Bay of St  Antonio  is a small Village now possest by  Indians  but formerly built by some  Franciscan  Fryars who were put ashore here by the  Spaniards  to convert the  Indians  but it being a bad place often overflown with water and the  Indians  being very poor the Friars quitted the Village of which the  Indians  have now possession It is but bad going into this Bay by reason of a great shole of Sand which runs a great way into the Sea from its NorthPoint And when you are in you lie open to the South the South West and other westerly Winds  From this Bay to the River  Sande  is six leagues Between which the Land rises in six Mounts not very high but at a distance they look like six Islands They are called the  Anegadas  and stretch from the Bay of St  Antonio  to the River of  Sande  This River of  Sande  is a great River and upon the Banks it is well inhabited by  Indians  who are not under the  Spanish  Government They are very poor and their Poverty protects them from the  Spaniards  who if there was any thing to be got would be sure to croud in amongst them The Coast all along here is deep and you may sail close to the shore in and fathom water clean owsie Ground  From the River  Sande  to Cape  Corrientes  is twelve leagues Cape  Corrientes  is very high Land and when you are at Sea it looks like an Island On the top it hath three Hillocks It is in the Latitude of d North And at the Point of it lies a small Rock It is a clear and good Coast but often subject to Rains  From hence the Land runs into a great Bay called the Bay of  Bonaventura  in which are a great many Rivers Islands and Sholes From Cape  Corrientes  to the great River of  Bonaventura  is twentythree leagues In the midway is the Island  Palmas  which is a small woody Island and hath a Sand on the South East side stretching from one end of the Island to the other Whether there be any Springs of fresh water on it I know not but very probably if any one stood in great need of water he might find some here For the Rains fall very plentifully here So that in the Valleys and Holes there can hardly be any want of Water This Island lies in the Latitude of d m N and we reckoned Longitude from  London  W to be d m  From the River of  Bonaventura  to the Island  Gorgonia  is twentyfive leagues S W Between which are a great many small Rivers at whose Heads the  Spaniards  wait for Gold which washes down from  the great high Mountains near them The Island  Gorgonia  is in the Latitude of d North The Island is pretty high and very remarkable for its two Saddles or risings and fallings on its top It is a very woody Island producing tall and large Trees and on it are several Springs of very good water The anchoringplace is at the Westend of the Island in a sandy Bay but the water is pretty deep It is about Miles in length and in breadth And at both the East and West ends is a small Island which looks white occasioned by the Dung of several sorts of SeaFowls which resort about them That at the East end is called  Flaminio  and the other at the West end near the anchoringplace is called the  Isletta  The Coast near the Waterside on the Main is low Land although very high within the Country and here are some Rivers that are shole for two leagues into the Sea Therefore keep off Shore For if it be flowing water the Currents will heave you ashore  From the Island  Gorgonia  to the Island  Gallo  is twentyfive Leagues This Island lies in a deep  Ensenada  or Bay Off the Island you will find not above four or five Fathom water but at  Segnetta  which is on the N E side you may ride safe in deep Water and free from any danger  This Island is pretty high and well provided with good Wood and several Springs of very good fresh water Here are also several brave sandy Bays at which one may clean a Ship as we did ours The water is pretty shole almost all round the Island and at both the North and South Point are several Rocks some of which look like a Barn others like Ships under sail It lies in the Latitude of d m N and Longitude West from  London  d m and we found variation d VVesterly  To the North East on the main Land distant three leagues is a large River called the River of  Tomaco  and about a league and a half within the River is a Town of the same Name This is a small  Indian  Town the Inhabitants of which commonly supply small Vessels with Provisions when they happen to come in here as they often do for refreshment At this River begins a great Wood of Trees which extends ten or twelve Leagues to the Southward If you stand in need this VVood may be very useful to you in making Masts or otherways All along this Coast are many Rivers at whose Heads both the  Spaniards  and  Indians  wait for Gold which washes down from the Mountains This is a very rainy place but especially from  April  to  October  which is the VVintertime here  At which time from hence all Northward along the Coast of  Mexico  you have continual Thunder Lightning and Rain with many hard Tornadoes Your Landmarks here are that the Land is higher than the Coast of  Gorgonia  and is very full of Hills and Trees And particularly it has One very high Mount  From the Island  Gallo  to Point  Manglares  is twelve Leagues The Coast runs N N E and S S W And between them is a little Island or rather Rock called  Gorgonilla  From the Point of  Manglares  are several Rocks and Shoals which stretch out two Leagues into the Sea Otherwise all the Coast is clear and deep and good Anchorground Whilst we were here we found a strong Current setting to the North but whether it be always so I know not From this Point begins a deep Bay called the  Ancon  of  Sardinas  It is about ten Leagues over and in the Bay are a great many Sands and it is shoal a great way off so that it is ill venturing in with your Ship Close by the Seaside it is all low Land full of small Rivers whose Banks are very wellpeopled with  Indians  The Water of these Rivers is very white and both smells and tastes very strong of Musk occasioned by the many  Alligators  which are in them At the South end of this Bay begins  the high Land and the Coast stretches away to the W S W till you come to the Cape of St  Francisco  From the  Ancon  of  Sardinas  to the River of St  Jago  is six Leagues All along the shore is full of white Clifts and near the Land the Water is shole This River of St  Jago  is a very great River yet Ships enter but very seldom though the  Spaniards  have a small Village Leagues up and the Banks of it are all along well inhabited by  Indians  who have several Plantations of Maiz with Walks of Fruits and Pens for Cattle to wit Beeves and Hogs of which here is good store At the Mouth of the River they say is four fathom Water If you would enter keep nearest to the South East side and when you are over the Bar there is very deep Water It is a Mile broad and the highest Land on all the Coast except St  Matheo  which is seven Leages from it This River lies in the Latit of d m North Longitude from  London  West d m  From this River to the Bay of St  Matheo  is seven Leagues This Bay is very high Land and has a great many shoals running from it two Leagues into the Sea and for three or four Leagues the Water is shole not above four five or six fathom Both to the Northward and Southward  by the Seaside the Land is all white Cliffs The Bay lies just in the middle of them In the bottom of the Bay are two Rivers of fresh but Alligatorwater that is to say white musky Water On each side of the Mouth of these Rivers are shoals of Sand and near the Rivers Mouths are very pleasant Rows of fine green Trees which is the mark to know the Rivers by For the Mouths of them are so narrow that at a distance you cannot perceive them  From this Bay of St  Matheo  to the Bay of  Tacames  is seven Leagues This  Tacames  is lower Land than the Bay of St  Matheo  and at its entrance between two Sholes is a small Island You may anchor in any part of the Port to windward and the nearer shore the better anchorage and the deeper Water Here you may wood and water In this Port were taken by  Don Beltram  a  Spaniard  a few stragling  English  Men He came hither unawares and took them as they were wooding and watering a small Vessel Off the two Points of this Bay run two dangerous sholes right off from the shore for near a League and half but between them both is pretty deep Water and the Southermost of the said two sholes stretches away along shore for Leagues to the Point of  Gallera  The Coast here  runs E N E and W S W to Cape St  Francisco  The Point of  Gallera  is a low Point and off it lie many Rocks and Sholes You may know the Point by this that there are two white Cliffs upon it near the Waterside  From Point  Gallera  to Cape St  Francisco  is two Leagues It is a high Cape but far higher within Land than near the Waterside VVhen you are North or South from it it looks like three Capes It is a woody mountainous Land and has several white Cliffs This Cape is famous for the rich Prize named the  Cacafogo  taken just off it by Sir  Francis Drake  in which was said to be eighty Poundweight of refined Gold twentysix Tuns of Silver with a considerable quantity of Jewels VVe took off this Cape two  Spanish  Ships one of Tuns laden with VVine Brandy Sugar Marmalett Flower  c  the other about sixty Tuns laden with Pitch Tar and Cordage This Cape St  Francisco  lies in the Latitude of d North and Longitude from  London  West d m and we found here d m westerly variation  Note  That from this Cape of  St Francisco  to the Southpart of the Great Island of  California  in the Latitude of d m from  April  to  November  is the dirty  fainy Season with hard storms of Wind and prodigious Flashes of Lightning and terrible Claps of Thunder which are at the worst in  June July  and  August  Also between the aforesaid places all the Coast is full of Worms and therefore very inconvenient for a single Ship as we were But to the Southward of this Cape the  Spaniards  constantly affirm there are no Worms For those Ships which trade only on the Coast of  Peru  and  Chili  and never go to Northward of this Cape are never Wormeaten This Cape is as I may say the bounds of the rainy and bad Weather it seldom reaching to the Southward of it unless by chance perhaps not one Year in twenty I have once heard that the Rains came up as high as  Paita  which lies in the Latitude of d m S and is d m to the Southward of this Cape of St  Francisco  But this was but by chance and I never heard from the  Spaniards  that ever it went so high up excepting that one time in any of their Memories  This Cape of St  Francisco  hath at the pitch of it a small Rock The Coast here runs away more to the South Eastward About three Leagues distance from the Cape is a small Port called  Apottete  near which is a round Hill behind which is good Wood and Water and near it is  very smooth landing It hath two white Clifts and at the Head of it is good Anchorground Sometimes though seldom here springs a fresh Gale of Wind from the shore which may drive you from your Anchors if you be not careful  From  Appottete  to the first River of  Cogimes  is three Leagues There are three Rivers of this Name and they lie close one by the other They are all full of sholes in most places stretching a League and more from the shore into the Sea Wherefore if you be two Leagues from the shore you will do well to keep sounding But to windward of the said three Rivers you may come nearer the Land Yet it is all along not very deep to  Coaque  A little to the Southward of the Southermost of these three Rivers is a small and barren Island right against which are the Mountains of  Coaque  These are very high Mountains covered with large and tall Trees at the foot of which is a small Village of  Spaniards  and  Indians  called by the Name of St  John's  Village and near the Village is the River of  Coaque  which runs a great way up into the Country  From the River of  Coaque  to Cape  Passao  is twelve Leagues Between which two places is the River of  Sama  and the  Bay of  Baciabo  The River of  Sama  has a Rock and Shoal of Sand just at its entrance and when you are about a Mile further it divides into two Branches the one running to the N E and the other to the S E but how far either of them runs up I know not The Bay of  Baciabo  which is about a Mile to the Southward of the River of  Sama  is a pretty deep Bay At the bottom of it are a great many white Clifts which are supposed to lie directly under the Equator The Bay is rocky all round and at each of its Points are some very dangerous Sands which stretch four or five Miles off to the Sea From hence to the Cape  Passao  is about five Leagues In all which way are many small Points and Bays most of which are very well clothed with several sorts of Trees tall and streight and of various Shapes and Colours And the Land is of an indifferent height This Cape  Passao  is a high round Cape with but few Trees on it It lies in the Latit of d m South Longitude from  London  West d m and we found variation here d m Westerly At the Pitch of the Cape are two Rocks both of them visible above Water and within the Cape the Land is pretty high and mountainous and very woody If you want to anchor near the Cape you must  go to the S W over against a small Town where you may ride securely from the South Winds in eight fathom Water Observe that you come not too near the Cape for it has some rocky Ground that lies near it The Cape as I said before is full of round Hills and in the Northpart of it is a sort of Water which we call halfwholesome because it is brackish and tastes as if fresh Water and Salt were mixed together This Water issues from a Rock which lies a Stonescast from the VVaterside to the left Hand of the landing place  A little to the Southward of the said Cape is a small River from which to the Bay of  Caracas  is three Leagues This is a pretty deep Bay and at the bottom of the Bay is a River called the River of  Charapoto  which is said to run a great way up in the Country In the middle of the Bay is the common anchoring place and on the Southside rightagainst the said anchoring place is a small Village called the Village of  Charapoto  In it are not above eight or nine Houses mostly built of Palmetoleaves and inhabited by  Indian  Fishermen who have little or no other Food but Fish These People are very poor and the  Spaniards  have little or no converse with them for that reason In the middle at the entrance  of the Bay is a small Island of an indifferent height very well clothed with Trees and from the Northpoint of this Island to the North point of the Bay runneth a shole clear over so that there is no going over with a Ship But on the Southside of the Island between it and the Main you may safely venture for there is no danger The Coast here runs N E and S VV  From the Bay of  Caracas  to the Port of  Manta  is seven Leagues and they bear from each other N E and S VV Between them are several Points stretching out into the Sea and between these Points are several sandy Bays The Land is of an indifferent height and very full of Trees Right off the Port of  Manta  almost in the middle just at the entrance is a Rock or small Island which but just appears above VVater This Port of  Manta  is a small Port but in it you are defended from the South VVest and other Southerly VVinds which are the common VVinds upon this Coast For from Cape  Passao  in the Latitude of d m South to and beyond Cape  Blanco  in the Latitude of d m South there is seldom or never any Landwind VVhich is very observable because it is so contrary to all the rest of the Coast For upon all the rest of the Coast you have common  Land and Seawinds each as duly succeeding the other as the Night the Day the Landwinds being commonly right off the shore and the Seawinds from the South blowing within a Point or two along the shore In the Port of  Manta  is a small  Indian  Village said to be formerly a Habitation of the  Spaniards  in which they built a Church that is still standing The best anchoring is overagainst it where you may anchor in seven or eight fathom Water good fast Ground The Land hereabouts is very barren producing only a few shrubby Trees and some small Bushes The  Spaniards  who had formerly possession of this place live now seven Leagues within Land where they have built them a large Town called by the same Name The other Landmarks of this place are that on the Northpart the Land is of an indifferent height and  Monte Christo  looks like a Sugarloaf from whence you will see the Land run plain to the top of the Cape of St  Lorenzo  and is of an indifferent height Also a little to the Westward of the said Port is a shole of Quicksand which lies under Water and the Sea never breaks upon it Many a good Ship has been cast away upon it  Two leagues to the Southward of this Port is a little Rock pretty high above  the Water from which Rock to the Cape of St  Lorenzo  is three leagues Half a league before you come to the Cape is a good anchoring place where if you want fresh water you may supply your self All the Coast is deep and clear and you may ride in any part of the Cape of  Saint Lorenzo  The Cape is highest near the water side On it are only a few Trees and Bushes Right against it are two Rocks which look like two Friars and are so called The one is high and slender and the other looks very bluff When you are off at Sea the Cape bearing North and distant about four or five leagues shows plain above and you may see the top of a Steeple of a Church or Chapel This Cape I make to lie in the Latitude of d South Longitude from  London  West d m and we found variation d m Westerly A little Southward of the Cape lies a shole of Sand which stretches out to Sea from the Main about a league and is in breadth about half a league  From Cape St  Lorenzo  to the Island  Plata  is five leagues and they bear from each other E N E and W S VV This Island is so called from the great quantity of Plate which was shared here by Sir  Francis Drake  and his Company It lies in the Latitude of d m South It is in length about a league and in breadth  about half a league It is of an indifferent height but highest at the East end There are upon it some few small Trees but not fit for any use There are several Rocks and Sholes at both Points of the Island which stretch out into the Sea near a mile and the Sea often breaks upon them And at the South East end are three small and steep Rocks It is deep water all round except at the two aforesaid Points and the anchoring place is on the East side in a sandy Bay where is good anchor ground and smooth water For in it you are defended from the Southerly VVinds which are common VVinds off this Coast VVhether there be any water upon the Island I know not but at some certain times of the Year here are said to be plenty of SeaTurtle  From the Island  Plata  to the Island  Salongo  is six leagues This Island is higher Land than the Island  Plata  It hath two small Rocks which are pretty high the one at the South the other at the North end of it At this Island is a pretry good place to ride in on the East side next to the Main Land and there is a parcel of white broken Ground a little to the Southward of the anchoring place  Right against this Island on the main Land is the Bay of  Picoya  at the North side of which is a small anchoringplace  and on both sides of the Bay are sholes of Sand but in the middle the water is deep enough Therefore it is best keeping an equal distance between both Shores and with that precaution One may venture in with safety In going in you will pass by three small Rocks Come not too near them for they are shole half a mile round At the bottom of the Bay is the River  Picoya  about three leagues up which live  Indian  People who supply the  Spaniards  with many Necessaries  To the SouthEastward of this River and Bay of  Picoya  distant about two leagues are two small Rocks called  Ahoreados  or the Hang'dmen Because  Machiaco  the Tyrant an  Indian  King in a Battle he had with the  Spaniards  took two of them Prisoners which he caused to be hanged one upon each of these Rocks  From these Rocks a little to the Southward is the River of  Colanche  It is a freshwater River and in it is said to be four or five fathom water good Anchorground The Inhabitants who are  Indians  carry water to the Town of  St Hellena  wherewith they supply that Town Right against the River but a good distance from it is the Island  Colanche  This Island is said to be extraordinarily healthy and on it are some few  Indian  Inhabitants  who spend most of their time in fishing here being pretty good store of Fish with which they partly supply the Town of  St Hellena  just by All round the Island is ten fathom water close to the shore so that you may go from one part to another very securely  From the River  Colanche  to the Town of  St Hellena  is four leagues This is a small Town consisting of  Spaniards  and  Indians  They have commonly in it some store of Provisions as Biscuit Pease Flower Corn dryed Fish salted Beef Pork and other Necessaries with which they supply such Ships as arrive here The best anchoring is in about seven or eight fathom water a little to the South West of the Town The Land is here very low and barren having no Trees and so stretches away to the Point of St  Hellena  This Point is high Land and very even at the top It lies in the Latitude of about d m South At a distance it appears like an Island because the Land about it is low and it bulges out into the Sea directly to the West Overagainst the Point on the Northside there is a Bay and if you fall in there in the Night keep your Lead going and mind your Depth till you can either get out or with conveniency come to an anchor  The Point St  Hellena  makes the North point of the Bay of  Guiaquill  as Cape  Blanco  does the South It is a great Bay in which are some Islands many Rivers and abundance of Sholes  From Point  St Hellena  to the Point of  Chandy  is about five leagues Off this Point lye several dangerous Sholes therefore great care must be taken of coming near it  From the Point of  Chandy  to the Island St  Clara  is seven Leagues North and South Between which two places are a great many dangerous Sholes and there is no going between the Island St  Clara  and the Island of  Puna  For all along on the Eastside of the Island St  Clara  and on the West side of the Island  Puna  are a great many Sholes which stretch from one Island to the other The Island St  Clara  which is the first Island at going into this Bay is an indifferent high Island pretty well clothed with small Trees It resembles a Corps in a Shroud the East end representing the Head and the West the Feet  Between this Island and Cape  Blanco  which is about twenty four or twenty five Leagues distant is the Channel for Ships who keep to the Southward of the Island and a good distance from the Point of  Puna  and steer away East till they have  past the Island  Puna  They have in the Channel going in from thirty to twenty fathom Water and when they are come up with the S E Point of the Island  Puna  then the River turns away to the North and grows narrower and narrower to the Town of  Guiaquill  and the Land all along by the sides of it is low swampy Land over grown with small MangroveTrees  The Town of  Guiaquil  is a large Town said to contain near five thousand Inhabitants In it are several fine Churches and other good Buildings It is situated on the lower part of a declining Hill so that the Houses near the Water side are often overflown It is pretty well fortified having two Forts one standing upon the Hill and the other in a Vally near the South end of the Town It is the third greatest place of Trade on the Coast of  Peru  From the Town of  Guiaquil  to the Island  Puna  is seven Leagues This is a low Island in many places overflown It is about thirteen Leagues long and five broad At the Point of  Arena  is the common anchoring place for Ships till they get a Pilot to carry them close up to the Town of  Guiaquil  This Point  Arena  is a very low Point from whence to Cape  Blanco  is twenty eight Leagues All along  upon the main Land it is very full of Sholes which stretch from the Main into the Sea above two Leagues and the great Rivers that run out from the Land augment them Here is all along a great row or Wood of Trees and amongst the Trees is the River of  Tumbes  upon the Banks of which are fed store of Cattle It is a passage for Travellers there being a great Road from it to several Inland Towns and Villages  From the River  Tumbes  to  Mancora  is fourteen leagues a clear Coast and from thence to Cape  Blanco  four leagues This Cape is high Land and from it blow such boisterous Winds that it is a common Proverb with the  Spaniards that the Stoutest Man of War must strike to Cape Blanco  Yet here is never any great Sea This Cape I make to lye in the Latitude of d m  S  Longitude from  London  West d m and we found Variation d m Westerly  From Cape  Blanco  to Point  Parina  is seven Leagues In the Midway is a small Bay and Port called  Malaca  It is very seldom made use of and at its South Point is a great Shole which runs out to the N W into the Sea above a Mile Therefore in going in it is best to keep nearest the North shore to avoid this Shole Between this Shole and the Point of  Parina  are several little Bays but of no use And excepting the Shole near the Point of  Malaca  all is deep and clear so that you may ride where you please only you must mind that your Groundtackling be good because of the hard Gusts of Wind which often blow here The Point of  Parina  is low Land towards the Sea side and at a distance it appears like two Islands one of which looks round and the other cragged as if it was cut in Pieces and to Leeward of the Point is a fine little Bay  Upon the Coast of  Chili  and  Peru  from the Island  La Moucha  in the Latitude of d m  S  to the Point of  Garachina  in the Latitude of d N the Wind is always Southerly two Points upon the shore Thus when the Coast runs North and South the Wind will be at S S W When the Coast runs S S E the Wind will be at South  c  Except it be in the Night and then the Seawind commonly ceases and there comes a fine and moderate Gale from the Land  From the Point of  Parina  to the Port of  Paita  is seven leagues Between which two places is the River of  Colan  At the Mouth of this River are two Sands one on each side stretching about a Mile towards the Sea and in the middle of these two Sholes is the Channel which is pretty  deep Up this River are many  Indian  Towns and Villages The Country hereabout is very mountainous and barren but the Valleys are said to be very Fruitful as they are all along to the Southward upon this Coast The highest Mountains here are the Mountains of  Motapa  which are also barren and have many Pieces of broken ground on them but at the top in two or three places the Land is pretty even and looks like Tables In this Bay you have the Land and Seawinds constant The Seawind is commonly at South and S by W which begins about nine in the morning and holds commonly till nine or ten at Night then this Wind dyes away and about half an hour or an hour after the Landwind springs up which is commonly at East right off the Land and continues a fine fresh Gale till about eight in the morning Then it falls calm and soon after springs up the Seawind as before Up the River of  Colan  is a Town of the same Name The  Indians  of this Town come down commonly with the Landwind to  Paita  in Boats and bring fresh water to supply the Town of  Paita  and the Shipping that be there For they have no fresh water at  Paita  They also bring them Wood and other Necessaries And when the Seawind blows the  Indians  with their Boats return again to  Colan  In  Paita  Bay is very good AnchorGround from twentyfive to six fathom Water As you draw nearer the Town the water grows shole gradually It is a fine large Bay capable to contain near a hundred Sail of Ships It is all over sandy Ground and in it you are defended from the South West and other Southerly winds by a Point of Land which runs out between the Bay and the Sea so that Ships riding within this Point lie always in as smooth water and as safe as if they were in a Pond It is in the Latitude of d m South And we found variation here d m Westerly Within this Point is the Town of  Paita  which is a pretty little Town consisting of about eighty Houses most of them  Spaniards  Although it is a place of no great Trade yet it is seldom without shipping because it lies so very convenient for all Ships going up or down And it is very seldom that any Ship passes by without putting in here for Refreshments of which this Town is well supplied by those of  Colan  From  Paita  upwards the Coast runs W S W two leagues to  Pena Oradada  or Golden Rock from whence to the Northermost Island of  Lobos  called  Lobos de Terra  is two leagues more and they bear from each other North East and South  West This Island  Lobos  has a Shole and a great hollow Rock at the North end of it which stretches out near half a Mile into the Sea The Anchoringplace is at the North East end in four and five fathom water The Island is of an indifferent height and is so like to  Lobos de la Mar  that though the  Spaniards  are very well acquainted here yet they often mistake the one for the other It is a very rocky Island not producing any thing and on it is no fresh water Of SeaFowl here are Boobies Noddies Penguins  c  And of Fishes here are SeaLions and Seals in abundance  From this Island to the Point of  Paita  is fifteen leagues North and South And between this Island and the foresaid Point is the Bay of  Sechura  a league from  Lobos de Terra  Upon the main Land is the  Chair of Paita  It is high Land towards the Seaside so that there is none like it between it and Cape  Blanco  The Coast here runs East North East and South South West  A little to the South East is the Port of  Monura  which is said to be almost as good a Port as that of  Paita  There is very good fresh water to be had with abundance of several sorts of very good fish It is said to lie in the Latitude of  d South The land hereabouts is all mountainous and barren  From the Windward Point of this Port of  Monura  to the Island of  Lobos de la Mar  is seven leagues This Island lyes in the Latitude of d m South Here is commonly a great Sea the whole Year through and the currents set along shore to Leeward Here  Paulo Andrea  and  James Querba  two  Spanish  Captains were cast away It is dangerous coming near this Island by reason of the many Currents which always run here The Island is not above two leagues round The Harbour is towards the N E part whose passage is very narrow but it is indifferent safe going in to those that are any thing acquainted with it and within the entrance is a good Port to lye and refit or clean a Ship in But here is no fresh Water and it is so barren that it does not produce any Trees or Bushes Here are abundance of Seals and SeaLions and several sort  of very good Fish  From the Island  Lobos de la Mar  to the Mount of  Etem  is five leagues It i  a high Hill and appears round From which place the Coast falleth away lo  by the Seaside to the Port of  Chiri  Yet up in the Country the Land is ver  high and mountainous At this Po  Ships often lade with Flower  A little to the Southward is the Port of  Pacasmayo  In this Port is a Rock which is hollow and which commonly has abundance of white Birds about it Here is fresh Water but the Spring is said to be three quarters of a Mile from the Sea whence they carry Water to  Chiripi  This Port of  Pacasmayo  is a brave Port It lies in the Latitude of d m South and the anchoring place is on the Weatherside of the Port near the Mount of  Malabrigo  Here are said to be abundance of WaterRats which often do great damage to Ships Cables  Not far off is the Port of  Malabrigo  and near the Port is a Mountain called by the same Name It is a high Mountain and at the top of it is some broken Ground Near it you may perceive the Breasts of  Chicama  which stand above the Town of  Pisan  These are the Marks for the Port of  Malabrgo  There is also to know the Port by not above two leagues from the Main a small Rock called the Rock of  Malabrigio  This Rock at a distance looks as if it was cut in two in the middle and it lies in the Latitude of d South The best place to anchor in is to Leeward of the Mountain of  Malabrigo  bringing it to bear due South and there is no less than fifty fathom Water good fast Anchorground  The Rock of  Malabrigo  bears with the Port of  Guanchaco  alias  Truxillo  South East And between these two places is the Bay of  Chicama  At the bottom of which Bay is the River of  Chicama  the Banks of which are well inhabited by  Indians  Hereabouts is commonly a strong Current setting into the Bay of  Chicama  and to the Northward withall On the Northside of the River of  Chicama  is a small Village of  Spaniards  called the Village  de Chao  Hence a little to the Southward is the Port of  Guanchaco  which is the Harbour for  Truxillo  In this Port are two sholes of Sand pretty near the shore but the anchoring place is without them It is but a bad Port and without defence being exposed to all Winds In it there runs so great a Sea upon the shore that very often for three or four Days neither can any Boats go ashore nor come from the shore yet this is a place of great Trade Near the Waterside is the Town of  Guanchaquo  which is a small fishing Town and about six Miles within Land is the City of  Truxillo  which is a large City and mostly inhabited by  Spaniards  It hath a great Trade for Flower Brandy Sugar Wine and Marmalett of which they export three or four Shiploads every Year with which  they supply the City of  Panama Guanchaquo  is the Port by which they export all these Goods And it lies in the Latitude of d m South  From hence not far to the S E is the Mountain of  Guanapi  a high Mountain and which the Sea falls very heavy upon To Leeward of this Mountain about a Mile is a little Island which runs out about a league and near to that Island is a Rock which is high and round and when you are at a distance from it it looks whitish This Rock of  Guanapi  and the Island of  Saints  are distant from each other nine leagues bearing N W and S E Between them are two more Islands one of which is called the Island of  Clao  Four leagues before you come to this Island it is somewhat dangerous and by that time you begin to draw pretty near the sholes you will see two little Rocks one bigger than the other which Rocks are rightagainst a small Bay in which is a good Port defended from the Southwinds but here is no fresh Water but what is fetched from a Town three Miles off From this Bay towards the S E is another Rock near unto the Mainland Off which Rock is a shole about three Cables length from it And more to the Southward is the Rock of  Santa  distant about a league and a half Near this Rock is a  Port called  Santa  and in entering into this Port the  Spaniards  commonly look out for a spot of Land which is very plain and looks like a Pathway When they see that Spot or Pathway they run in boldly and in the Road they have not above or fathom Water At this place at a small Village a little within Land called the Village of  Orsa  and inhabited by  Spaniards  is commonly store of Biscuit Wood VVater and other Necessaries to be had In the Channel between the Island and the Main any Ship may go keeping nearer to the Island than the Main And it is good to keep a pretty distance from the little Island which lies near the Land for there is foul rocky Ground The Island of  Saints  is a league in length It is white Ground and has three broken Places one of which looks as if it were cut in two in the middle On the Southpart of it is a little Island at which there is good anchoring and it lies in the Latitude of d South  From this Island to the Port of  Cosma  is ten leagues The Coast runs N N VV and S S E At the South point of this Port is a little Rock and a small shole of Sand all round it and within on the same side is a River of fresh Water at the Mouth of which is the common anchoring place and at the North point  coming in is a small low Island but higher at both ends than in the middle This  Cosma  is a very good Port and in it you are defended from most Winds It lies in the Latitude of d m South and Longitude from  London  West d m In the Mouth or Entry of this Port there is no danger for all is clear and good Ground On the Southpart of the Port is a great Mountain called the Mountain of  Mongon  A little to the Southward of the South Point of the Port and about a league from the Mountain of  Mongon  is a small low and even Island called the  Isletta  within which close in under the Main are two small Rocks  From the Port of  Cosma  to  Mongon  is three leagues and from  Mongon  to  Mongonilla  four leagues This is a small Port and seldom made use of yet in it you are defended from the Southerly Winds From  Mongonilla  to the  Caleta's  is two leagues These are two small deep Bays in both of which is good anchoring About a league to the Southward of the Southermost of these is the Port of  Vermejo  Right before the Mouth of which is a small and indifferent high Island called the  Isletta  This Island has a Bay on the East side called the Bay of  Callibria  and between the Island and the Port are some bad sholes This Port of  Vermejo  is a very good Port but not inhabited There is no fresh Water nearer the Sea side than a Mile  The Mountain of  Mongon  which lyes about seven Leagues to the Northward of this Port is the highest Mountain that is known on all this Coast It may be seen at a great distance off at Sea and many times Ships stay a Month or more by it by reason of the Currents that set to the Northward along the Coast The best way is to keep off at Sea as much as you can until you come into the Latitude of  Callau  From the Port of  Vermejo  to  Guarmey  is three leagues  Guarmey  hath a plain spot of Sand and the Land within is double and hath some spots of Sand on the top of it and within the Port is a round white Rock where there is good riding on the Weather side in eight fathom Water good clear fast Ground In this Port is a River of fresh Water which runs into the Sea near a parcel of Rocks where the Ships commonly unlade It is furnished with Wood Water and other Necessaries It lyes in the Latitude of d m South And here the Coast runs away S S W to the Island of  Don Martin  From the Port of  Guarmey  to  Jaquey of Sarra  is four leagues This Peice of the Coast runs away South Between these  two places is a high Mountain and over againg it a small Port From  Jaquey of Sarra  to  Monjala  is six leagues This is a little Mountain which is nothing but a barren Rock and at a distance to those off at Sea it appears white and looks like a Ship under Sail From  Jaquey of Sarra  to the River  Barancis  is nine leagues This is a fresh Water River and runs a great way up in the Country the banks of it are very well inhabited with  Indians  and hereabouts are a great many fields planted with Wheat From the River  Barancis  to the Port of  Supe  is two leagues This is a small Port and seldom made use of for want of Trade although in it you are defended from the Southerly Winds The Land hereabouts is high and mountainous and the Mountains most of them very barren but the Valleys are said to be very fruitful From this small Port of  Supe  to the Island of  Don Martin  is three Leagues This is a whitish Island plain and even and lyes about three quarters of a Mile off the shore  From hence to the Port of  Guara  is one league This Port lies in the Latitude of d m South And we reckon Longitude from  London  West d m On the windward part of this Port is a Mountain on the top of which are some Pyramids A little to the Northward of  this Port is a small Port called the Port of  Salinas  It is the best Port of the two but they are both something dangerous At this place is abundance of Beef readysalted of which they send great store both to  Lima  and  Panama  From the Port of  Guara  to  Tambo  is four leagues The Coasts runs N N W and S S E and in the midway is a small anchoringplace called the Port of  Chancay  It is all clear and good Ground and this Port of  Chancay  is a very good Port from whence is transported to  Lima  Wheat and store of other Provisions In it you ride secure from the South winds From this Port to the Rocks  Piscadores  is two leagues There are several of these Rocks but the middlemost is the biggest About these Rocks are abundance of several sorts of very good Fish and upon these small Islands or rather Rocks are several  Indian  Huts inhabited by  Indians  who are Fishermen for which reason these Rocks are called the  Piscadores  Within these Rocks is a fine Port called the Port of  Anton de Rodas  in which is secure riding from most Winds The Land is pretty high and the Hills mostly barren  The Rocks  Piscadores  lie due North and South with  Callau  and East North East from the Islands of  Ormigas  which lie  eight leagues from  Callau  right off the shore The Islands of  Ormigas  are small On them are several pieces of broken Ground with several small Bays About them are abundance of several sorts of very good Fish The Fishermen come from  Lima  to this place a fishing and here the  Indians  make abundance of Seafish Oyl  The Island  Callau  is very high and barren having neither wood nor fresh water nor so much as any green thing upon it It is two leagues long Upon this Island is the great City of  Lima  which is the CityRoyal for the Empire of  Peru  It is the Seat of a ViceRoy and an Archbishop It is a large City said to contain  Spaniards  besides a far greater number of  Mullattoes Mostese  and  Indians  In it are said to be twentyfive Parish Churches all well built and very rich in Gold and Silver and precious Stones The Images of many of their Saints being of massy Gold It is well fortified having a Castle of seventy Brass Guns fortyeight Pounders close under which is the common place of anchoring and they commonly ride in six fathom water good fast Ground The Island is joined to the main Land by a Bridge of Stone and almost one half of the City is on the other side upon the main Land It is a place of the greatest Trade of any on the West side of  America  and  the Harbour is never without Shipping In all this Coast towards the Southseas it is observable that it seldom rains yet with the Evening and Morning Dews the Valleys are said to be as fruitful as any in the whole World But the Hills are as barren for few of them produce any thing nay many not so much as Grass At this place groweth a famous Occidental Bezoar which is found in the Maw of the  Peruvian  Sheep which Sheep they make use of to carry Burthens For it is said one of these Sheep will carry pound weight with ease and that like a Camel they will go two or three days without eating or drinking A little to the Southward of the anchoringplace and off the Point of  Callau  is a shole of Sand which runs a great way into the Sea and right off the shole is a rocky Island called the Island of  Lima  This Island has several small Rocks about it but the biggest of them lies at the South end This Rock is called  Pena Oradada  or the Golden Rock because a Galeon was lost near it in which was said to be a very great quantity of Gold This  Pena Oradada  is very high and no Ship can pass between these Rocks or between the Rocks and the Island of  Lima  But Ships that come from the Southward steer in between  Pena Oradada  and the Point of  Callau  till they come to the Island of  Lima  to avoid the great shole which runs off the Point of  Callau  And when they have past the Point of  Callau  they steer directly to the Anchoringplace and in their way there is no danger In all this Bay or Port of  Callau  is secure riding it being clear and good fast Ground growing shallow gradually from twelve to four fathom water and in it you are defended from the Southerly wind which is the common Tradewind off this Coast About this Island and among the Rocks are store of very good Fish and upon most of them are some Huts in which are  Indians  who make it their constant employ to fish which Fish they carry to  Lima  to sell and then return to catch more This Port lies in the Latitude of d m South  Four leagues to the Southward of these Rocks is  Pachacama  near to which are two round Rocks one bigger than the other and near Them is another parcel of little Rocks about eight or ten in number Here the Land is very high and mountainous having two or three rows of Hills one within another  From these Rocks to the Port of  Chilca  is three leagues It is a very good Port and good anchoring The entry is on the North East side In this Port is a Rock called the  Tortois  and when you are once within  that all is clear and there is six or seven fathom Water In this Port they load great Ships with Salt for  Guiaquil  The Town stands two leagues from the Port and is inhabited partly by  Spaniards  and partly by  Indians  It is but a small Town consisting not of above twenty or twentyfive Houses mostly ill built  From this Port to the Island  Asia  is two leagues It is an indifferent high Island about half a league long and hath a defense for little Ships Near it lie two Rocks  From this Island to the Port of  Canete  of  Guarco  is three leagues Here the  Spaniards  lade Wheat for  Lima  and several other places The marks of the Port are that there is a high Mountain called the Mountain of  Guarco  which appears as if it was split in two and the Sea falls with a great force upon it It hath a Fort on the top of it which appears white when you are off at Sea  From  Canete  or  Guarco  to  Chinca  is nine leagues The Coast runs N N W and S S E It is a bad Port and in it is com+monly a great Sea Here is laden Whea  and  Indian  Corn to be transported to  Li+ma  and near it lie three Islands which are distant from the Customhouse of  Chin+ca  three leagues and bear with it N E and S W  From  Chinca  to  Pisco  is three leagues  Pisco  is a Bay in which is a Port and at the bottom of the Port is a River of fresh water All the Coast is clear and good and there is good riding in six fathom water At this place they lade Wine in great quantity with which they supply most places hereabouts The Land is very high and mountainous The Hills are barren but the Valleys are full of pleasant Vineyards with the Grapes of which they make extraordinary good Wine this being one of the chief places for Wine on all the Coast  From  Pisco  to  Paraca  is three leagues It is a good Port and lyes in the Latitude of d m  S  Hereabouts the Valleys are planted with abundance of Wheat and they also make store of Wine  From  Paraca  to the Mount of St  Gallan  is two leagues It is a high Mount and barren having not any green thing upon it Overagainst the Mount is a high Island called the Island of  Lobos  which is a league distant from the Main About this Island are many Rocks and near the Mount is a shole The Mount lyes in the Latitude of d South  The Land here is of a prodigious height lying in Ridges parallel to the shore three or four Ridges one within the other and each surpassing the other  in height Those that are furthest within Land are the highest and they always appear Blue to those that pass by them at Sea  The Weather upon this Coast of  Peru  from the Latitude of d South to Cape  Blanco  in the Latitude of d m South is always fair here never being any storms of Wind or Rain although many times it is so hazey that there is no taking an observation with the Quadrant Also upon all this Coast are but very few Rivers they being in some places a hundred and sixty or a hundred and seventy leagues asunder whereas on the Coast of  Mexico  are abundance of Rivers many within half a league or a league of each other Also the Rivers of the Coast of  Mexico  are always full and many times overflow their Banks but these on this Coast of  Peru  are little and shallow and at some certain times of the Year quite dry  In the Island  Lobos  is a good Harbour which has two Mouths but they commonly enter by that which lies to the S E and come out at that which lyes to the N W  From this Island to the Mountain of  Asia  is twelve leagues The Coast runs N N W and S S E and it is pretty Windy hereabouts Near this Mount of  Asia  on the East side is an anchoring place  in a small Port called the Port of  Cavales  This Port is somewhat dangerous by reason of several sholes near it It lies in the Latitude of d m South One League to the S E of this Port is a very good Port called the Port of St  Nicolas  From whence to the Port of St  John  is three Leagues Its Entry is at a Bay and you may go through any part of it This Port is very windy and is said to have no fresh Water At it they make a small quantity of Wines which they send by shipping to  Lima  and  Panama  From the Port of St  John  to  Acary  is nine Leagues The Coast runs S S E and N N W It is a low Coast by the Waterside although the Land is very high and mountainous in the Country and here is good Anchorground but Ships seldom anchor in it because of the high Winds and great Sea which is commonly here  From  Acary  to  Attiquipa  is leagues It is high Land towards the Seaside and here begin the high mountainous Hills and Deserts of  Atico  At this Port Ships of the largest size lade with Corn and other Necessaries It lies in the Latitude of d South It blows not so much here as near the Mount of  Asia  From this Port to the Mount of  Atico  is fourteen Leagues The Coast runs S E and N W It is a bold shore and high Land  by the Seaside but within it is much higher  From  Atico  to  Ocana  is leagues At  O+cana  is a River of fresh Water but at some certain times it is dry Near the River on the Main land is some broken Ground and on the SeaCoast are some Rocks which are called the  Piscadores  About them are a great many sorts of very good Fish and the Inhabitants of  Ocana  come hither often to fish  From  Ocana  to  Camana  is six Leagues The Coast runs S S E It is a good Coast and here the  Spaniards  make abundance of very good Wine  From  Camana  to the Port of  Chule  is five Leagues This is a good Harbour for Ships but there lies a Rock a little to the S E of it which you must not come in less than a League of for there is a shole about half a League round it But keeping a League from the said Rock there is a good Entry  From hence to the Port of  Quilca  is eight Leagues In the way is the Island  Guara  which is a pretty high but barren Island A little to the Southward of this Island is a good Port called the Port of  Ariquipa  It is a good Port In it are five great and small Rocks of a whitish Colour They lie in the Latitude of d m South and in going in the Entry is very narrow but within there is eighteen  fathom Water and the Port when you are in resembles the Coil of a Cable Within is a great Vulcan called the Vulcan of  Ariquipa  which Vulcan is said to be sixteen Leagues within Land and is the highest of all the Hills hereabouts VVhether it burns now or no I know not but I suppose by its Name it has formerly From this Port of  Ariquipa  to the Port of  Ylo  is twelve Leagues The Coast runneth S S W and N N E And two Leagues from  Ariquipa  is the River of  Tambo  In which space is a League of low Land near the Seaside and there is good clear Ground from six to twelve fathom Water  From the River  Tambo  to  Yerba Buena  is two Leagues and from thence to the Port of  Ylo  eight Leagues This is a good Port to lade and unlade a Cargo in and near to it is a River of fresh Water called the River of  Ylo  This as most of the other Rivers of  Peru  runs with a quick Current from the beginning of  January  till the latter end of  June  and then it decreases running slower and slower till the latter end of  September  After which it wholly fails and becomes dry the VVaters not beginning to run again till  January  This most of the Rivers on the Coast of  Peru  are said to do as constantly as the Year goes about Near to this River  is a Valley very well inhabited by  Indians  in which they have store of Corn and other Provisions and several sorts of very good Fruits The Point of  Ylo  is low Land and runneth out into the Sea It is dangerous coming near it for off it lies an Island and several Rocks It is in the Latitude of d South To those that are off at Sea the Point looks like two or three Islands and it bears with the Mount of  Sama  S W and N E distance eight Leagues  This Mount of  Sama  is a high Mount and under it are four pieces of broken Ground of a whitish Colour Near to it is a small River called the River of  Sama  From hence to the River of  John Dens  is four Leagues This River lies in the very bottom of the Bay of  Arica  and the Banks of it are very well peopled with  Indians  From the River of  John Deus  to the River of  Arica  is two Leagues On the Banks of this River is situated the Town of  Arica  It is a large Town inhabited by  Spaniards Mullattoes Mostese  and  In+dians  This Port of  Arica  lies in the La+titude of d m South Longitude from  London  West d m and we found variation d m Easterly It i  a very good Port and is the Embarcad  to most of the MineTows of  Peru  It is a place of very great Trade and seldom or never without shipping It is a good place to anchor in and the best and common anchoring place is close under the Mount of  Arica  which is a great high Mountain and defends Ships that ride there from the Southwinds The depth of the Water is about eight fathom VVithout the anchoring place is a small Island called the  Isletta  The Land here is very high and mountainous and from hence for near a hundred Leagues to the Southward it is very much subject to Calms within thirtyfive or forty Leagues of the shore These Calms are not usual on any other part of this Coast that I know of VVhen the Sun is in the Northern Signs that is from  March  to  September  the VVeather is commonly fair and clear But when the Sun returns back into Southern Signs then the VVeather for the most part is hazy and the Horizon so thick as often to hinder an Observation  From the Mount of  Arica  to  Chacola  is a League and half Here is a very good anchoring place And from hence to the broken Land of  Victor  is a League and half more From thence to  Camarones  is six Leagues and from thence to  Tucames  fourteen Leagues The Coast  from the  Mount of  Arica  to this place North and South  From  Tucames  to the Island  Yaneque  is twelve Leagues from which place they carry Clay to lay in the Valleys of  Arica  and  Sama  and here live some few  Indian  People who are continually digging this clayey Ground for the use aforesaid for the  Spaniards  reckon that it fattens the Land very much  From hence to the Bay of  Majalones  is twenty Leagues all high mountainous Land and a great Sea falling upon the Shore so that there is scarce any landing From  Majalones  to the Bay of  Salado  is eight leagues In neither of these Bays is there any fresh water  From the Bay of  Salado  to the Mount of  Moreno  is fourteen leagues The Coast runs North and South In this Port of the Mount of  Moreno  is store of Salt and here is very good fresh water to be had It is a good Port and in it you are defended from all Winds Within the Port the best riding is on the Northside It is a very high Mount and like to the Mount of  Capricorn  which on the top has a great Rock  From the Mount of  Moreno  to the Mount of St  George  is twelve leagues Except at this Mount of St  George  there is no ancho+ring hereabouts  CHAP VII  A Description of the Coast of  Chili  The Port of  Copiapo  The Port of  Guasco Coquimbo Tongoi Lymary Choape Govanadore Papuda

Valdivia  Port The Occasion of its Name  Chili  abounds most in Gold as  Peru  does in Silver  FRom hence the Land is all very high and barren to  Copiapo  which lies in the Latitude of d South and we found  variation d m Easterly It is a good Port and defended from all Winds Near into the Port are four or five Rocks The water on shore is brackish It is inhabited within Land by  Indians  who make good Wine and here is good Meat Corn and other Necessaries The marks of the Mount of  Copiapo  are that it looks like the Point of  Saint Hellena  and that about a league to the Southward is an Island In this Port they load Wine Money and other Goods for  Coquimbo  From the Island which lies by the Mount of  Copiapo  to the Bay of  Salado  is five leagues in which Bay is an anchoringplace and a River of fresh water From the Bay of  Salado  to  Totoral  is ten leagues The best riding here is on the North side of the Point which will be a defense from the Southwinds At this place is good wood and water to be had  From  Totoral  to the Port of  Guasco  is ten leagues all the way high mountainous Land but a clear Coast from Rocks or Sholes Within the Port is a small round Island and at the bottom of the Bay near this Island is a River of fresh water right against the Mouth of which is the common anchoringplace The Country hereabouts is said to be pretty well inhabited by  Spaniards  In this Port you are defended from the South and South West  Winds The Land is pretty plain and even and at the top of the Port is a Plain of Sand Off the South West Point of the Port are seven or eight Rocks about which are many Sholes and there is no sailing between them and the Main  From hence to the Port of  Coquimbo  is ten leagues  Coquimbo  is a good Port and the common anchoringplace is right against a small round Island on the South side of the Port called the Island of  Tortuga  Without this Island near to the South West Point of the Port are two Rocks but any Ship may go between them and the Main for there is very deep water To the Northward of these Rocks are the Islands of  Paxores  which are eight or nine in number There is deep water between them and amongst them are caught several sorts of very good Fish with which they supply the City of  Coquimbo  Some of these Islands are very high and rocky but the Land upon the Main is not altogether so high as it was from  Copiapo  to this place A little on the North East side of this Port is a noted great Hill in fashion of a Sugarloaf at the bottom of which is situated the City of  Coquimbo  which is said to be a large and very rich City i  driving a great Trade with  Lima Panama  and most of the Southsea Coast  From the Port of  Coquimbo  to the  Herradura  is three leagues and they bear from each other South South East and North North West This  Herradura  is a small deep sandy Bay but seldom made use of by shipping although in it is good fast anchorground But the reason is it lies too much open to South West and other Southerly winds  From the  Herradura  to the Bay of  Tongoi  is four leagues At the bottom of the Bay is a River of fresh water and right against the Rivers Mouth is the common anchoring place where is good defense from all the Southerly winds  From this Bay of  Tongoi  to the Port of  Lymary  is eight leagues The Coast runs North North East and South South West The marks of this Port are that ir hath a great Mount near it called the Mount of  Lymary  the sides of which either to the Northward or Southward appear full of high Trees and in the middle of the Mount is broken Ground and to the South VVest of it are two Breasts or Bosoms  From  Lymary  to  Choape  is ten leagues This  Choape  is a high Hill it has neither Port nor anchoringplace but the Coast is full of Rocks  From  Choape  to the Port of  Govanadore  is thirteen leagues This Port lyes in th  Latitude of d m South and Longitude from  London  West d m The Land is of a great height three rows of Hills one within the other The Port of  Govanadore  is a good and safe Port It is defended from the Southwinds which are the common Tradewinds of this Coast The anchoring place is right against the lowest part of the Land in twelve fathom water At the end of the small piece of low Land is a Hill which has broken ground on the top of it and looketh like the Chair of  Paita  On the N W side of this Hill is a Grove of great high Trees and near the Port is an Island on the North side of which is a good anchoring place and secure riding for the Island it self keeps off the Southerly Winds  From this Port off  Govanadore  to the Port of  Laligna  is five leagues Near the Point of this Port are two sholes on which at high water there is not above ten foot water In this Port Ships lye at anchor in five fathom water and here Ships load with Wheat and other Eatables for  Panama  From  Laligna  to  Papuda  is three leagues It is deep but very good anchor ground It hath a high Hill with broken ground on the top of it and near it is a spot of Trees So that it is very like the Port of  Govanadore  From  Papuda  to the Rocks of  Clintera  is five leagues These Rocks lye visible above water and near the Land the Currents set strong to the Northward Ships often sail pretty near these Rocks for it is all clear and deep seldom less than twelve fathom Water  From these Rocks of  Clintera  to the Port of  Clintera  is two leagues In it is deep water and the Port has only a defense from the South winds but to all Westerly winds it lyes open This Port bears with  Valpariso  N N E and S S W distance sive leagues And between it is all very high and mountainous Land Yet between the Hills are many pleasant Valleys which afford good Corn and Wine  Near the Point of  Concon  is a little Bay in which are four small Rocks each of these Rocks has a small shole quite round them and the anchoring place is close over to the South shore and in between the said Rocks at the bottom of the Bay is a small River called the River of  Concon  upon the Banks of which are situated several small  Indian  Towns and Villages Here are several tall and large Trees which upon occasion will make very good Masts for Ships  A little to the Southward of this Point of  Concon  is a large River called the River  of  Chily  upon the Banks of which are several Towns and Villages belonging to both  Spaniards  and  Indians  This River is said to run some hundreds of Miles within Land About half a League to the Southward of the Mouth of this River are two small high Rocks they lie about a Mile and a half from the shore They have each of them a small shole of Sand round them and there is no sailing between them and the Main because it is sholewater  From these Rocks to the Port of  Valparizo  or St  James  of  Chili  is three Leagues Here are four or five small Rivers running into this Bay which make the Port of  Valparizo  I do not know any where so many Rivers so near each other upon all the Coasts of  Peru  or  Chili  But upon the Coast of  Mexico  it is very common This Port lies in the Latitude of d m South It is a place of great Trade and from hence they send yearly several Ships laded with Corn Wine  c  and store of Gold For although  Peru  is reckoned to abound in Silver yet  Chili  is most abundant in Gold Here is a pretty Town of three hundred Houses belonging to the  Spaniards  all pretty well built with Brick But in none of these Parts of  Peru  or  Chili  are they so well built as they are in and about  Mexico  The Reason as I  suppose is that at  Mexico  they have a great many of their Materials from  Old Spain  which here they cannot so well have This place is govern'd by a  Spanish  Governour as are all the Seaports But in the Country within Land there are several Cities Towns and Villages governed by  Indian  Governours yet with Subordination to the  Spaniards  This Port is famous for the great Trade it drives with  Lima  and the other Parts of  Peru  as also for the rich Prize taken in it by our  English  Hero Sir  Francis Drake  in which Ship he took a vast quantity of Gold besides several other valuable Commodities He also took the Town in which he found store of Provisions The Anchoringplace is at the bottom of the Bay close under the Southshore in seven eight and nine Fathom Water good fast Ground rightagainst the Mouth of the River  Buajes  where is a very good defense from all the South or Westerly Winds by reason of a Point of Land called the Point of St  James of Chili  which shoots out to the Northward and lies between the Anchoringplace and the Sea At this Point is a shole of Sand which as the Point does stretches away to the Northward so that it is dangerous coming near the said Point for the Shole runs out beyond it near half a league and at high water there is not above  nine foot water on it The Coast here runs South South East and North North West  From the Point of  Valparizo  to the Bay of  Zenaque  is one league And from thence to the Bay of  Rio  another In this Bay is a little Rock which is called  Bishops Rock  From this Rock to the Bay of  Salinas  is four leagues In this Bay is a good anchoring place and it has a good defense from the Southerly winds It is low Land by the Seaside although in the Country it is very high and mountainous Here are several small Bays in most of which is good riding in ten fathom Water  From these Bays to  Topa de Calma  is four leagues Between them are the Sholes of  Raphael  and a River of the same name right against them These Sholes come out a league into the Sea and there is no going between them and the main Land for the Water is very shole At  Topa de Calma  is an anchoringplace but it lies open to the Southerly Winds and near it is an Island on the Northside of which is a small Bay in which Ships upon occasion sometimes come to an anchor and in the said Bay is not less than twentyfive fathom Water This place is much frequented with high winds  From  Topa de Calma  to  Lora  is fourteen leagues This  Lora  has broken Ground like to  Lymary  and part of the Coast in the way is low Land by the Seaside till you come to the River of  Maule  which is distant from  Topa de Calma  seven leaves In this River is two fathom at low water In it are said to be many  Indian  Towns and Villages in which they have plenty of Provisions It is a very windy place and at the entry of the River are two Rocks half a league to Leeward of which is a small anchoringplace From this River of  Maule  to  Lora  as I said before is seven leagues Near to the broken Ground is an anchoring place which has a defense from the Southerly Winds  From  Lora  to the Point of  Ʋnmos  is three leagues It is a bad Point having abundance of foul Ground lying off it On this Point were cast away two great  Spanish  Ships and all their Men drowned It is good to keep at a distance from it  From the Point of  Ʋnmos  to the River  Itata  is seven leagues The River is extraordinarily well inhabited by  Spaniads  and  Indians  and on the Southside near the River's Mouth is an anchoringplace The Coast is deep from  Topa de Calma  to this place without any Port or anchoring place excepting those I have named  From the River  Itata  to the Point of  Sinfonda  is four leagues This Point runs out a good way and to the Southward of it is a fine Bay called the  Herradura  at the bottom of which is a River and on each side the River is broken Ground This  Herradura  is in form like the Letter C It hath three Rocks at the entry and within is defended from the North and South Winds  From the  Herradura  to the Island  Quiquina  is two leagues North East and South West This Island is foursquare and on the Eastside is a small Bay in which is very good anchoring in five fathom water Ships that come from the Northward go between this Island and the Main on the North East side when they are bound to the Port of  the Conception  and it is a clear and good Passage free from any Rocks Sands or Sholes and it is deep water But Ships that come from the Southward go in between the South Shore and the South West side of the Island but they always keep nearest to the Island by reason of a Rock and Shole which lie about a mile and a half off the Main This Rock and Shole is called the  Grifo  and is very dangerous For several good Ships have been lost upon it And a little within this  Grifo  is another dangerous Shole called the  Mormao  A little  within which is an anchoring place But the chief anchoring place is right against the City of  the Conception  Here are several small Rivers but none of note This City is near to the Seaside It is a very pleasant place having a fine River running through it And three quarters of a mile from the City is another fine River called  Anderlen  Ships that ride in the Port of  Conception  must come to an anchor rightagainst the Fort of  Don Garcia  that they may be ready to sail with a Northwind This is a place of great Trade affording both Corn Wine and Oil of which they send great quantitie  yearly to  Lima Panama  and other Part  of  Peru  This Port lies in the Latitude o  d South On the Southside of th  Port near the Mainland are sholes a  along to the S W Point which Point  a defence from the Southerly Winds  About a league to the Southward  this Point is another Port called the Po  of St  Vincent  and between these tw  Points is a small Island with several Roc  about it and at the Point of St  Vince  are some very dangerous sholes whi  stretch off near a League into the S  But within the Port it is all good cle  Ground with gradual Soundings fro  nine to four Fathom Water It is a ve  good and secure Port and in it is a defe  from most Winds It is all a sandy Bay round the Port on which are many small scattering Houses mostly inhabited by  Indians  From this Port to the River  Biobio  is two Leagues This River runneth very strong with a great Current and hath two Rocks at the Entry of it At this River beginneth the high Land of  Guera  This Land is accounted by the  Spaniards  to be the highest Land of any yet known in the World far exceeding the  Pico  of  Teneriff  or  Santa Martha  or any Land yet discovered Near this River are the Breasts of  Biobio  which are two high Hills naturally in the form of Breasts  From this River to  Labipi  is seven Leagues In the Harbour of  Labipi  is secure riding and it has a defence from the North and South Winds Near this Harbour is the Island of  Santa Maria  in the Latitude of d m South This is a low Island about two Leagues in length It is very well inhabited by  Indians  On the N E side is a fine deep and secure Bay in which is from twelve to four fathom good fast sandy Ground the Water growing shallow gradually as one goes nearer to the bottom of the Bay  From the Island of  Santa Maria  to the Island  Canero  is ten Leagues and they bear from each other N W and S E  The Land here upon the Main is of a prodigious height but here is no Port or Place of anchoring unless it be in the Port of  Canero  In this Port is the Island  Canero  It is a small Island lying on the Northside of the Port just within its entrance And at the bottom of the Bay is a small River of fresh Water In this Port are no Rocks nor Sholes nor any danger but all gradual Soundings and it has a a good defense from the S and S W and other Westerly Winds which are the worst Winds upon the Coast  The Winds here are variable all round the Compass as it is upon all the Coast of  Chili  Upon the Coast of  Peru  from the Line to degrees of Southern Latitude the common Tradewind is Southerly with fine Weather and no Rain But here upon this Coast it is common to have hard Gales of Wind and very often great showers of Rain  From the Port of  Canero  to the Hill of  Tucapel  is two leagues This is a high Hill with a Plain or Table Land on the top And a little to the Southward of it is a River of the same Name The Land hereabouts is very well inhabited by  Indians  At the Mouth of this River on the Southside is a small Point called the Point of  Tixba  From this Point to the River  Imperial  is eight Leagues This is a large River running a great way up into the Country and the Banks of it are very well inhabited by  Indians  Right against the Mouth of the River is the Island  La Moucha  This Island is about four or five Leagues in length It is pretty high Land and very well clothed with tall and flourishing Trees of several sorts and on it are several small Rivulets of fresh Water It is very well inhabited by  Indians  who are always at War with the  Europeans  For they think all white Men to be  Spaniards  This was the Southermost and the first Land we saw upon our coming into the South Seas About this Island are several sholes and especially on the Westside which stretch out a great way into the Sea On the Eastside is a fine Bay in which is very good safe anchoring It lies in the Latitude of d m South and I made Longitude from  London  to this place West d m and we found variation d m Easterly It was at this place that Sir  Francis Drake  and his BoatsCrew going ashore for Water and asking the  Indians  for  Agua  which is the  Spanish  name for Water the  Indians  by their Language thinking them to be  Spaniards  with whom they are always at mortal Variance fell  upon the  English  and with their Arrows wounded every one of them but by the good Conduct of Sir  Francis  he and his Company got to his Boat and so saved themselves to the Ship  A little to the South of this Island on the main Land is the River of  Tolton  which is a large River And here the Rivers are commonly full as on the Coast of  Mexico  not drying away at certain times as they do on the Coast of  Peru  This River is distant from the Port of  Valdivia  Leagues  Valdivia  or  Baldivia  is a noted place It lies in the Latitude of d South It is very well fortified and hinders the approach of an Enemy In this Port are a great many Islands on one of which is situated the Town and Fortifications of  Valdivia▪  This place as we were told by the  Spaniards  was so called from one  Valdivia  a  Spaniard  who was formerly Governour o  it This Man was said to be so covetou  of Gold that he would not by his good+will let any body have any but himself▪ The poor  Indians  he would punish so bar+barously that they often died under it▪ and his reason was because they did no  bring him Gold enough He employe  some thousands of  Indians  to seek it an  taxed them so much  per  Day which th  poor  Indians  being not able to get an  knowing if they returned emptyhanded they should be severely used they joined together in a Body and took two pound weight of Gold which they melted and with it resolutely came to the Governour and said  O  Valdivia  Thou hast a very great and greedy desire after our Gold we have used all possible means to satisfie thee but could not Now by good hap we have thought upon a way Here is Gold drink thy fill for here is enough to satisfie the most Covetous  And immediately they bound him and poured it down his Throat with which he presently died and with his death gave name to this Town and Port of  Valdivia  The  Indians  have ever since been at War with the  Spaniards  and hold them hard to it And the  Spaniards  are desirous by all means possible to conquer these people that they might be Masters of so rich a Country For though  Peru  does abound in Silver yet this Empire of  Chily  is the most aboundant in Gold And  Mexico  abounds both in Gold and Silver Cochineel Indico and Cocoa They have also in  Mexico  many Mines of Iron but the  Spaniards  think it not worth their while to open them  A TABLE of Latitude Longitude and the Variation in most of the

Arrival at  Amboyna  AND now having given a particular Description of the Coast of  Mexico Peru  and  Chili  from the Tropic of  Cancer  to d South as far as we observed our selves or could learn from the  Spaniards  I shall return to the Gulf of  Amapalla  where we were fitting our Vessel in order to our intended Voyage for  India  Here therefore we went ashore at the Island  Conchagua  to seek for water and after some search we found behind the Hills a large bottom in which was a large Plantainwalk and a great deal of Rainwater that fell from the Mountains This was very inconvenient for us because lying so behind the Hills we knew we must be forced to carry all our water over a high Hill which we could hardly climb by our selves But seeing there was no remedy we first cut down the Bushes which were in our way to make us a clear Path After which the Hill being pretty steep on the Landside towards the bottom wherein was the fresh water we with our Axes and Shovels cut out steps in the Hill And our Sailmaker having in the mean time made us a CanvasPipe of about ninety fathom  long to carry our water from the top of the Hill down to our Cask which lay at the foot of it we went to work to fill our water each Man having with him a six Gallon Cask The water which we took up was very muddy and on the top of it grew Duckweed as it does usually in our Ditches At first we raked the Duckweed away But our Doctor perswading us that if we took up the weeds they would mightily preserve our water we according to his advice took up both weeds and water together When each Man had filled his six Gallon Cask he carried it up to the top of the Hill and then poured it into the CanvasPipe which conveyed it down the Hill into our Cask Thus we employed our selves for four days And having filled about twentyfive Tuns which we concluded would last longer than our Victuals and got it on board our Vessel the next day being the st of  January  we all went ashore to the Plantainwalk And having cut down a sufficient quantity of them we returned at night on board our Vessel intending to sail next day This Evening two of our Men who had resolved to stay with Captain  Dampier  left him and came over to us so that now we were in number  viz  thirtyfour  English  and one little  Negro  Boy whom we had taken from the  Spaniards  During the time of our watering our Bark the Men on board the Ship belonging to Captain  Dampier  were busie in refitting their Ship as well as they could The Carpenter stopt the Shotholes which they had in their Powderroom with Tallow and Charcoal not daring as he said to drive in a Nail for fear of making it worse And the four great Guns which usually stood between Decks were put down into the Hold there being sixteen besides which was more than they had Men to manage for there remained with them no more than twentyeight Men and Boys and most of them Landmen  On the st of  February  we left the Gulf of  Amapalla  and Captain  Dampier  in his Ship the St  George  at anchor in it We steered out between the Island of  Amapalla  and the Island  Mangera  and many times had not above two fathom Water We had a fine Gale of Wind at N E which soon carryed us out of the Mouth of the Gulf So long as we had been in any of the Harbours on this Coast of  Mexico  we had seldom been allowed any thing but Flower Excepting that we used to go ashore and found upon the Rocks store of Conchs Oysters Muscles Snails  c  of which we made many a good Meal But now being in hopes of  getting into a Land of Plenty we bore Hunger with more patience And indeed we had great need of Patience For now our Commons was lessened to half a pound of course Flower a Man  per  Day with two Ounces of SaltMeat every other Day Our Vessel was a small Bark with two Masts of about seventy Tuns which we had taken from the  Spaniards  But whilst we lay here she was so eaten by the Worms that she begun to grow very leaky and to add to our Afflictions we had no Carpenter neither if any of us should fall sick had we any Doctor or any Medicines to make use of And which was worst of all we had no Boat to assist our selves if our Vessel should fail us for the Doctor Carpenter and Boat were left with Captain  Dampier  But trusting to Gods Providence who had already delivered us out of so many dangers we proceeded on our intended Voyage for  India  On the  d  of  Febuary  we had a calm most part of the day and night and this day we caught several Fish called  Yellowtails  See Fig XXVIII  which came swimming about our Vessel These Fish were about four Foot in length He had twenty Fins on his Back one middling one near the hinderpart of his Head one large one near the middle of his Back and eighteen small ones stretching from the said large one to  his Tail He had two large Fins near his Gills one of each side and thirteen under his Belly  viz  one middling one underneath near the Gills one large one near the middle of his Belly which goes in with a Dent and eleven small ones stretching from the said large one to his Tail which is Halfmoon'd He has a very large Head a great Eye and is extraordinary good Food It is very Fleshy having no Bone but the Backbone These Fish when taken by us looked very white but the tips of their Fins and Tail were yellow for which reason we called them  Yellowtails  They were very welcome to us for whilst they lasted which was three days we saved our own Provisions feeding upon nothing else but this Fish  On the  d  of  February  the first part of the day it continued calm in which time five or six Turtles coming near the Vessel we caught two of them which still served to help us out About six in the Evening we had the Landwind at N E a fine fresh Gale So we took our departure from the Mount of St  Michaels  a noted Mount of which I have already given a Description It lies in the Gulf of  Amapalla  in the Latitude of d North We reckoned Longitude from  London  West d m and as I said before we found Variation  d m westerly We steered away S W the sooner to get off the Land into the true N E or E N E Trade For we knew the present Wind to be only the Landwind which we could not think would last long For we did not expect to get into the true Trade till we had run about ninety or a hundred leagues from the Land For which reason we steered away as I said S W and S W by W Which course we held till we came into the Latitude of d When finding our selves in the true Trade we hauled away VV N VV intending to get into the Latitude of d North and so as near as we could to maintain our Latitude till our arrival at the  Ladrone  Islands knowing if we kept in that Latitude it was impossible to miss them We had fine fresh Gales of VVind first at N E but as we run off the Land we found it edge to the N E by E and thence to the E N E where it continued with us till our passing the  Ladrone  Islands VVe now made us studding Sails out of our Mainsail and Maintopsail VVe got our studding Sails up by day break every morning and at Sunset haul'd them down again For it commonly blew so fresh in the Night that we were forced to settle our Topsail and with the rising of the Sun the VVind would something abate again  Yet we always had as much as we could well carry with our Studdingsails The Tradewind we found here to blow much brisker than it does in the  Atlantick  or  EastIndian  Oceans  For the first twenty Days after our Fish and Turtle was gone we fed upon nothing but our Plantains of which we allowed our selves two for a Meal and two such Meals a day But after our Plantains were gone we went to our half pound of Flower a Man  per  day and our two ounces of Salt Beef or Pork every other day The Meat had been so long in Salt that when we boiled it it commonly shrunk one half So we finding a loss in boiling our Meat concluded to eat it raw which we did all the Voyage after so long as it lasted We now and then caught a Dolphin and sometimes saw a great many Seabirds as Boobies Noddies  c  which would come and settle upon our Vessel and happy was he that could catch one of them  In this Run I think none of us took the pains to observe by the AZ  th  Compass For the variation was so little that we never minded it  On the th of  April  towards Evening we saw the Clouds gather about the Horizon much more than usual This was a great sign or token of Land For  it is common between the Tropicks to be foggy or cloudy over the Land although it be never so clear at Sea Therefore all this Night we took a special care to look out and on the th in the Morning betimes we saw the Island of  Magon  bearing West distant about ten Leagues  See Fig XXIX  It was a high woody Island and very plain and green on the top So we stood towards it and when we had brought it to bear North distant about a Mile I took the Draught of it which appeared as in the Figure Being in so near we laid our Ship by and several fishing Boats came to us and brought us some Fish with some Eggs Yams Potatoes  c  These vvere very acceptable to us for now our Salt Beef and Pork was just at an end and we had nothing to trust to but our half pound of Flower a Day for each Man and that very full of Vermine Maggots and Spiders The Men in those FishingBoats were a very tall and largelimb'd People of a tawny Complexion having long black Hair reaching down to their middle They all go starknaked not so much as covering their Privyparts In exchange of what we had of them we would have given them Money but they looked on it and gave it us again making Signs to us to give them Tobacco in the room of it which we did and  they seemed very much pleased We also gave them some old Shirts which they immediately tore in pieces and rowled them round about their Heads We would have given each of them a Dram of Brandy but they were afraid to drink it Only one of them seeing us drink to each other and that it did us no hurt at last made Signs that he would drink with us So we gave him a good Glass full which he immediately drank off but we thought the Fellow would never shut his Mouth again for he was so amazed at the Heat it had left in his Mouth and in his Belly that I believe he thought he had set himself on Fire He laid himself down and roared like a Bull which scared most of the rest of them away After he had roared near half an Hour he fell fast a sleep And we being in haste put the poor Fellow into his Boat and made signs to his Consorts to take care of him that he might not fall overboard They seemed to be a very civil People but however we did not care to let too many of them come into our Vessel at a time Their Language we could not understand at all When they first approached us they tied two Sticks together in fashion of a Cross and held them up for us to see Which was as we suppose to signifie to us that they had some Knowledge of the Christian Religion  We in return showed them a Crucifix which we had taken from the  Spaniards  at the sight of which they all bowed their Bodies and came on board This Island of  Magon  I make to lie in the Latitude of d m North and we made Longitude from the Mount of St  Michael's  W d m or Miles allowing between and Miles to a degree of Longitude in this Parallel The Boats which these Fishermen came on board in were about forty foot in length and about seventeen or eighteen Inches broad aloft but not above three Inches broad below Their Head and Stern were alike The bottom to the Waters edge was one entire piece but hollow upon which for the side of the Boat was a piece of thin Plank about three foot broad and of the same length as the Boat it self It had its lower Edge sowed with Rattans to the bottom of the Boat They had two long Poles put out of one side One was within ten foot of one end of the Boat and the other within ten foot of the other end So that they lay distant from each other about twenty foot The Poles were about thirty foot in length at the end of which was a long piece of Plank of about twentyone foot of the same shape and about one fourth part of the bigness of the bottom of the Boat This piece is laid across  at the outer end of the Poles from one Pole to the other where it is very securely made fast And this altogether is called the Outleaker This is always the Weatherside and the use of it is to keep the Boat from oversetting For without the Outleaker the Boat is so narrow that it would not bear it self They have but one Sail which is made of Matt and like our  Bermudo's  Sail It is not above two Inches broad at top and hauls out by a Boom When they have a mind to go about it is only letting go the Sheet of the Sail and hauling it aft on the same side at the other end of the Boat and then that which was the Stern before is now become the Head any end going foremost and no distinction in the built of either end But the same Side still and always remains the Weatherside Most of these Boats were painted red  See the Figure of the Boat with its Outleaker  See Fig XXX  We were now in Consultation amongst our selves whether we should steer away for the North West amongst the  Philippine  Islands or to the South West for the Coast of  NewGuinea  But after a debate of about two Hours we concluded to haul away South West for the Cape of  New Guinea  Which accordingly we did and the same day passed by the Island of  Guam  which lies South from the Island  of  Magon  about seven leagues So that I make this Island to lie in the Latitude of d m North We only passed by it at a distance Wherefore I can give no particular Description of it Yet as we passed by I took a Draught of it as it appeared to us South distance leagues The Land to us seemed of an indifferent height but it was quite plain and flat on the top This Island belongs to the  Spaniards  who have a small Fortification on it  See Fig XXXI  It is kept for the conveniency of the  Manila  Ship which always touches here to refresh in her way to  Manila  From hence we kept our Course South West and passed by the Island of  Matan  which lies about six leagues due North from the Islan  Guam  And at six this same Evening being  April  the th we took our departure from the Island of  Magon  it then bearing North East distant nine leagues We still had a fresh Gale as usual at East by North and East North East And on the th we saw the Island of  Arracife  bearing East by North distant leagues It seemed to be a very high Island Whether it is inhabited or no I know not  From hence we steered away South South West till we came into the Latitude of d North Hitherto we had fine fresh Gales of wind at North East but now drawing near the Line we sound the Winds veer  depiction of island of Guam  Fig  Thus Showeth the Island of  Guam  the Body of it bearing  th  Distance

Ceram  Fig  Part of the Island  Ceram  A Fresh water River  w  ch  we watered  A Small woody Isl  first anchoring  The best anchoring place  The Island  Bonoa  to East South East and South East and often met with small Squalls of Wind and Rain till we came into the Latitude of d North and then we had a Calm for seven days This was a great disheartning to us for now we had so little Victuals that it would hardly keep us alive For we could not allow our selves any more than six Ounces of course Flower a Man  per  day This we used to scald with hot water and so eat it For want of sufficient Food we now found our selves to grow very weak But it was our good Fortune to have store of Water of which when we could not sleep for hunger we would drink a large draught This would satisfie us a little at the present so that we could sleep but as soon as we waked we always found our selves as hungry as before  On the d of  May  sprung up a small Gale of Wind at West and we steered away South till being almost out of hopes because the Wind began to die away again on the th about ten in the Evening we smelt a very fine and fragrant smell which gave us new hopes that we were near some Land We looked over our Draughts but they gave no Description of any yet we were sure we could not be far off some Land from whence that fragrant smell must proceed So we continued in our hopes till the next Morning when accordingly  we saw Land right ahead of us as far as we could see And a small Gale springing up at South East we steered away South West by West directly to it By Noon we made it to be three small Islands very low Land but all very green and pleasant At the same time we had an Observation and found our selves in the Latitude of d m North The Eastermost of the said three Islands bearing South East distant about four leagues which makes its Latitude to be d m North  At the same time we caught two  Bonetoes  See Fig XXXII  which were very welcome to us for they made a good Meal for all our Company And this was the first we had had for a long time This Fish is commonly of about three foot in length and two foot about It hath two middling Fins on his Back with eleven small ones stretching to his Tail He hath the like number opposite under his Belly with two large ones one on each side near his Gills He hath a very sharp Head with a small Mouth a full Eye and a halfmoon'd Tail It is a very fleshy Fish having no Bone but his Backbone And they make very good Broth  All this Night we stood off and on designing not to venture too near these unknown Islands in the Night not knowing  what danger there might be near them The next Morning at Daybreak being  May  the th we found our selves within a Ships length of a great ledge of Rocks which ran from Island to the other which we not seeing before and thinking to go between the two Islands had like to have been upon them But through God's great Mercy a small breeze of Wind coming from the Shore we got off and stood to the westermost Island because we saw many Sholes lying off the rest of them The Rocks we had like to have been upon were near the Northermost Island which upon account of our miraculous escape we call'd the Island of  Deceit  it having to the Eye discover'd no such danger When we came near the Westermost Island which was the biggest of the three we stood in for the Island and as we drew nearer about forty or fifty of their flying Proes came off in which might be about four hundred and fifty Men allowing ten to each Proe And we could see multitudes of people upon the Shore For as we past by any of these Islands to go to the next the people also followed us Their flying Proes lay at a distance from us and viewed us till we beckoned and made Signs for them to come to us Then one of them which was in the midst advanced towards us and being pretty near lay  and looked on us for a while VVe still made Signs for him to draw nearer Then he came within a Ships length of us and lay still again In her were ten Men all naked and in the midst of them a grave chearful old Man of a pleasant Countenance who had on his Head a fourcornered Cap without a Crown but otherwise he was quite naked as were all the rest of them This Man by the Respect which all the rest in the Boat showed to him we guessed to be a King or Prince At their approach to us they sung a Song which continued about a quarter of an hour VVe could not understand it but it was tuned very prettily VVhen this Song was done they came almost close to our Vessel's side and then sung another Song This was begun by the grave old Man and followed by all the rest in the Boat VVhich done they put themselves in the posture of praying and made several Bows and Cringes towards us after the manner of their Country Then one of the Men in the Boat having a very sore Leg held it up to us and pointed to the VVound By the Signs he made to us we understood that he would have us to cure it for we being white and they I believe having never seen any white Man before they seem'd as if they did not think us to be mortal Men  After this we poured some Water out of a Bucket into a Glass and pointing to our Mouths made signs that we wanted Victuals and Drink Then they shook their Heads in way of Denial as I suppose But seeing us still make towards the Island one of the Men in the Boat blew a Horn at the sound of which all the rest of the Boats made boldly to us Upon this we all believing they would be aboard of us fired a Musket over them not designing to harm but only to frighten them At the noise of which they seemed wonderfully amazed and drew back menacing us at a distance with their Paddles and still following us So seeing as I said before many hundreds of them upon the shore and finding we could have nothing from them but by force and having no Anchors or Cables by which we dare trust our Bark and besides having no Boat to go ashore in so that should we swim ashore as some of our Men proposed yet we could not carry our Arms with us and the  Indians  might knock us on the Head with Stones whilst we were in the Water we concluded there was no good to be done here VVherefore examining our VVater and finding sufficient for eighteen Days at a quart of VVater to each Man  per  Day we resolved to leave these Islands and to trust to God's Providence  to guide us to a more friendly place where we might supply our wants not doubting but we should furnish our selves with Water at some Island or other in a place where there were so many So we left the said Islands and called the Westermost of them  The Island of Disappointment  because we made certain account of getting some Water here but could not They were all three low flat even Islands full of several sorts of Trees all very green and flourishing And no doubt if we had had a Boat we might have met with something which would have been beneficial to our selves and of advantage to our Country As we might also at several other small Islands which we afterwards pass'd by The Inhabitants of most of these Islands were a very large strongbon'd People They had long black streight Hair which reached down to their middle and they all go stark naked not so much as covering their Privyparts I think I never saw such a parcel of large stoutlimb'd Fellows together in my Life We here found a Current setting pretty strongly to the Northward as it did ever since we left the  Ladrone  Islands  From these Islands we steered away South West having a fine fresh Gale of Wind at East The water here was very foul being full of Grass and other Trash  which lay driving up and down VVe sounded several times but had no Ground at a hundred Fathom so we still kept on our Course and kept good looking out all night The next Morning betimes being  May  the th we saw the main Land of  NewGuinea  bearing South by West distant eighteen or nineteen leagues And now with a few old broken Boards which we had in our Vessel we went to work to build us a small Boat which afterwards proved very useful to us The Land was very high and mountainous At a distance it looked very black but drawing nearer it looked more grey The th we had dirty squally uncertain weather and the VVinds variable all round the Compass VVe kept the Coast of  NewGuinea  aboard and the Land still continued to be of a good height very full of great high Hills and small Valleys which all seemed very barren  See Fig XXXIII  It is all a rocky Coast neither could we perceive any Harbour Bay or place to anchor in VVhether there be any Inhabitants hereabouts I know not but vve never savv any nor any sign of any either by Sea in Boats or upon the Land by Fires or Smokes as is usual in all inhabited Countries  The same day vve came abreast of two small Islands neither of vvhich vvas above a league in length They vvere lovv  and very vvell clothed vvith small and green Trees At the same time we saw also a part of the great Island  Gillolo  See Fig XXXIII  bearing VVest distant eight leagues This vvas also high Land but not so high as the Coast of  NewGuinea  We kept on our Course steering West South West intending to go between the Main of  NewGuinea  and the Island  Gillolo  this being our passage for the  EastIndian  Sea  From the th to the th we had dirty Rainyweather for the most part with uncertain Gales of Wind and in the Night it being dark and we not keeping the Coast of  New Guinea  so close aboard as we should we missed the common Passage and ran past it and in the Morning betimes found our selves amongst a vast number of small Islands When perceiving we had overshot the Passage and the Wind being at East we concluded to look out for a passage to the Southward amongst these Islands Accordingly we stood to the Southward but found a great many Rocks and Sholes which stretched from one Island to another Wherefore at Night there being little Wind and not daring to venture further amongst these unfrequented Islands and Sholes we resolved to lye by all Night Intending in the morning if the Wind should prove Westerly to return back again and  go through the common Passage but if it still continued Easterly then to indeavour to find out a new Passage to the Westward This Night we saw two or three Fires which were made on shore by the Inhabitants The Islands here were most of them of a good height and pretty well clothed with several sorts of Trees which all appeared very green and flourishing This day we put our selves to a Pint and half of Water a Man  per  day On the th we had fair weather with a fine fresh Gale at N E So we proceeded to the Westward and at the same time had a strong Tide setting to the Westward About eight this morning we shot in between two high Headlands which were distant from each other near two Miles Upon this some of us went to the Topmasthead to look if we had a clear Passage through and we saw not any let or hindrance So we got through this place by two in the Afternoon It was in length about seven leagues and about two Miles broad In it we could find no Anchorground till within a Ships length of the shore and then we had thirty fathom Water The Land here was of an indifferent height and very woody At noon the Tide setting back to the Eastward and it being calm we drove by five in the Evening half way back again  and drove with our Vessel so near the shore that we kept her off with our Poles and might have stepped from our Bark to the shore and yet our Vessel never touched the ground the Water being very deep close to the shore Not long after a strong Gale springing up again by seven in the Evening we got clear out of this streight the second time and then it fell calm again And we drove with the Tide which then set to the Westward In this streight we saw a flying Proe under Sail but it did not come near us We also in some of the small Bays saw several old Houses some standing and some half down but could not see any Inhabitants On the th we had little wind at E S E and sometimes calm but when we had any wind we steered away S by W Here we saw a great many Islands to the Southward of us but none of them so near together but that there vvas room enough to pass between them and scarce any ground to be found vvith one hundred Fathom of Line We still found vve got but very little the Tides setting sometimes to the Southvvard and then back again to the Northvvard so that vve vvere not yet got above a league to the Southvvard of the said streight vvhich vve after the Name of our Bark called St  Johns  Streighs And I believe vve vvere the first  Europeans  that ever past it  On the th vve had hazy vveather vvith small drisling Rain and little VVind so that vve vvere not above two leagues further to the Southvvard than vve vvere the day before VVe here met vvith a great many small Islands They vvere most of them of a good height and very vvoody but vve could perceive no sign of any Inhabitants The th vve had hazy vveather vvith fresh Gales of vvind at S E by S and thence to the S W by S so that vve vvere forced to reef our Topsails And in the Evening vve savv the Island  Ceram  bearing South distant nine leagues We then steering E by N having the wind at S E by S The Island  Ceram  at a distance seemed to be high Land and looked very black This day vve finished our Boat vvhich vve vvere building it vvas tvvelve foot long and four broad On the th vve had fair vveather vvith fresh Gales off shore so that vve vvere forced to stand off and on as the vvind vvould permit This day vve savv a Sloop to the Eastward of us which we vvould very vvillingly have spoken to But they kept from us standing to the Eastvvard along the Coast of  Ceram  So vve still plyed in for the shore and at noon savv the Island  Bonoa  The Island  Bonoa  lyes in the Latitude of about  d m South And it is almost in the  shape of a Horseshooe We still made towards the Island of  Bonoa  and on the th of  May  the wind veering about to the E S E and East we got in We anchored near the N W end of the Island in thirty fathom Water about a League from the shore We durst not venture any nearer in because of the many Sands and sholes which lye off here But we sent our little Boat ashore with two Men and an empty Hogshead to be filled with water When they came ashore they went up and down seeking for water and after some search found a small Pond Here they filled the Hogshead and at Night returned on Board They could not see any Inhabitants although the Island is very well inhabited But this North and N W side of the Island is very barren being nothing but great Rocky Hills not affording any thing but some small Bushes This probably might be the reason that we saw no Inhabitants hereabouts So that same Night a Laudwind coming off and we finding it very inconvenient watering here because we were forced to lye so far off shore with our Vessel and our Boat not being able to bring off more than one Hogshead at a time we weighed from this place intending to water upon the Island  Ceram  On the th we got into the Bay of  Ceram  where we Anchored in twenty five Fathom hard Sand not above two Ships length from the shore and sent our little Boat with three Men to look for water At twelve this Night they returned again having found out a fine small Spring of fresh water The next day it being calm we got up our Anchor and rowed our Vessel further in till we brought the said River to bear S E distant about half a Mile and then anchored in thirty Fathom water good fast hard Sand the bearings of the Land being as is represented in the Draught  See Fig XXXIV  The Bay here was very woody all round the Land pretty low the water pretty deep close to the shore which was sandy quite round the Bay From W S W to the S E and thence to the N by VV the Bay it self is a Defense from those winds and from the VV by S to the W N W the Island of  Bonoa  is a Defense The Island  Bonoa  is much higher Land than this part of the Island  Ceram  On the South side it is very well clothed with several sorts of large Trees and the Valleys are very fruitful in Rice Also on this South side it is said to be very well inhabited We staid in this Bay of  Ceram  till the d at Noon and then having filled eight Tuns of water and having a fine fresh Gale at S E we weighed from  Ceram  and steered out between  Ceram  and  the Island  Bonoa  but kept nearest the  Ceram  shore Between these Islands we saw several Proes and a Sloop We lay by and sent our Boat to the Sloop intending if they had any Victuals that they could spare to buy some of them But the Sloop made the best of her way and would not stay for our Boat So our Boat returned on board again  At the same time a large  Indian  Proe came on board us in which was a Freeman of  Amboyna  To him we declared our great want of Victuals having had nothing for a long time to eat but Flower and Water and so little of that as would hardly keep us alive He told us if we would go to the Island of  Manipa  which was then in sight he would be our Pilot and carry us in where he did not doubt but we might have Rice enough for our Money to carry us to  Batavia  Accordingly we steered directly for the faid Island of  Manipa  and in our way passed by the Island  Keylan  which is a small but high Island very well inhabited and clothed with several sorts of Trees Its chief product is Rice and some few Cloves And here liveth a Dutch Corporal with six Soldiers whose only business is to see all the Clovetrees cut down and destroyed From hence we proceeded to  Manipa  where we arrived at about twelve  at Night and came to an anchor in a small Bay at the N W end of the Island Then our Dutch Pilot sent two of his Men ashore with a Letter to the Governour to acquaint him with our wants On the d betimes in the morning a Dutch Corporal with two Soldiers came on Board and read to us an Order which he had from the Dutch  EastIndia  Company that it was not usual for any Ships except those belonging to the Dutch  EastIndia  Company to anchor there and that if any did they were not to supply them with any thing We told him it was through want of Victuals that we were forced to put in here and that if we could have subsisted we should not have touched at any place till our arrival at  Batavia  Wherefore we desired him to go ashore again and declare to the Governour our wants He seeing us in a very weak condition promised he would  nd that he would bring us word again Accordingly he went ashore and at four  the Evening returned again and brought  word that we should have no Provisi  s there but if we would go to  Amboy    there we might be supplyed So to  great discouragement we were forced  leave this unfriendly place intending  the wind would permit to go for  Am  a  The Island  Manipa  is in length S E and N W about fifteen Miles in breadth about eight and lyes in the Latitude of about d m South and Westward of the Island  Bonoa  about Miles It is a pretty high Island and very well inhabited by  Malayans  as are all the  Molucca  Islands It is shole almost all round which sholes some of them stretch a league and a half off the shore Wherefore unless a Man be acquainted or has good Draughts of the place it is dangerous coming near it The Island is of a good height but not so high as the Island  Keylan  before mentioned On it are several very good springs of fresh water and on the S W side of the Island the  Dutch  have a small Fort of six Guns The Island is governed by a  Dutch  Sergeant three Corporals and a Mastergunner and they have under them twenty  Dutch  Soldiers On it grow abundance of Cloves and Rice of which they send great quantities to  Amboyna  The Inhabitants are most of them Fishermen They catch abundance of Fish here not only enough for their own use but also to supply  Amboyna  with  From this place we stood to the South Westward having the wind at S S E And it blowing fresh we reefed our Top sails But when we got clear of the Island  it blew so very hard that we were forced to hand our Top sails and go away under our courses We were now quite out of heart For we did not expect to fetch  Amboyna  the S E Monsoon being set in which wind was right against us and besides it blew so hard that we could scarcely carry any Sail And we could not think of getting to  Batavia  because we had not Victuals to carry us thither and besides as the wind was we could not weather the sholes which lye to the E S E of the Island of  Bouton  So being almost in despair and the wind continuing we kept our course to the Southward till we came over against the Island  Bouro  and then the wind veering to the S S W we stood away S E But finding a strong Current setting to Leeward so that we rather lost than got ground and seeing no likelihood of getting to  Amboyna  we by a general consent shared all that was Eatable on Board our Vessel and the whole of what each Mans share amounted to was six Pound and three quarters of Flower with five Pound of Bran which how long it was to last we could not tell however every one designed to be as sparing of his part as possibly he could  On the th the wind veering about to the S S E we tackt and stood to the S W and soon weathered the Island of  Amblow  which is a small Island not above three Leagues in length It is of an indifferent height and lyes in the Latitude of d m South It is pretty well furnished with Trees of several sorts but not inhabited neither do I know whether there be any fresh Water upon it From hence we continued our Course till twelve at night when a hard Gale of Wind coming down upon us before we could hand our Sails by reason of our weakness it almost overset our Vessel It split our Mansail and Maintopsail all to pieces broke our Mainstay and two of our Foreshrowds We were then standing away South West and had the Wind at South South East intending if we could weather the Sholes to put for  Batavia  But as soon as the Squall was over it fell calm and then we had so great a Sea occasioned as I believe by the meeting of several Currents that we thought our Bark could not hold it out She laboured so much and the Sea took us so ahead astern and on both sides that we were always almost covered with water  On the th sprung up a fine fresh gale at S E Whereupon knowing we could not weather the Sholes we tack'd and stood away N E for the Island of  Amboyna  On the th the Wind continuing we held the same Course and on the th betimes in the Morning saw the Island of  Amboyna  bearing due North distant about six Leagues So we stood away directly for the Island and by Noon came just off the Harbour  CHAP IX  The  A  and the whole Crew and Ship secured at  Amboyna  A particular Description of  Amboyna  Its

Tryal of a certain  Malayan  for murdering his Slave The  A  and part of his Company released and depart from  Amboyna  AT our going into the Harbour of  Amboyna  we met with two Ships coming out These two Ships were laden with Cloves and bound for  Batavia  The  Dutch  Captain of one of them came on board of us and demanded from whence we came whither bound and desired we would give him a Journal of our Voyage promising to return it again upon our arrival at  Battavia  We satisfied him to all his demands and our Agent for the Owners gave him a small account of our Voyage  After which we stood farther in and the two  Dutch  Ships left us At night the Landwind coming off we run in for the Shore to anchor but could find no Ground with a hundred fathom of Line till we came within a Ships length of the Shore and then we had twenty fathom hard Sand Here we lay all night and the next Morning being in our account  Tuesday May  the th but according to the  Dutch  account  Wednesday  we having lost about eighteen Hours by our going to the Westward and the  Dutch  having got six Hours by coming to the Eastward which makes the difference of time to be hours two  Dutch  Orambyes with Paddles each came on board of us They brought the Fiscal Secretary and several  Dutch  Gentlemen and about thirty Soldiers who took possession of our Bark They also went down and sealed up all our Chests and the two Orambyes went ahead to tow us in and by noon we got up as high as the Town where they moored our Vessel in the common anchoringplace Here we continued till the st not knowing how they designed to dispose of us In which time they would not afford us any Victuals although we proffer'd them a Crown for a pound of Beef Pork or Bread In the Evening we were all sent on shore where they had provided us two Rooms  for our Reception near the StateHouse and our Bark Money and Goods except what we had about us were all taken from us and soon after our Bark and Goods were sold at a publick Outcry We were fed with very bad Meat which We who had been at spare Diet so long and our Stomachs were very weak could ill digest And if we vvould have better vve must buy it vvith our ovvn Money Several of us had the good luck to have some Money about us and as long as that lasted vve bought our ovvn Victuals of our Keeper Our  Spanish  Dollar vvhich was five Shillings and a Penny value he vvould give us no more than five  Dutch  Skillings for which was to the value of about Half a Crown And for this HalfCrown we could have no more Victuals than we might have bought for five Pence if we had had our liberty to go into the Tovvn So that instead of having five Shillings for our  Spanish  Dollar we had indeed no more than five Pence  And now being at a stop for a while at this Island of  Amboyna  a place often mentioned for the Cruelties used towards the  English  here formerly and having had time and opportunity to enquire into the Manners Ways Customs of the People Strength of the Island and Product of it I shall give a small description of it as far as I observed my self or could learn of any of the Inhabitants tho' secretly  And first This Island of  Amboyna  is in length North East and South West twelve leagues  See Fig XXXV  It is a high mountainous Land the Hills are somewhat barren but the Valleys are very fruitful The Soil is black and the Surface of it SaltPetreish The middle of the Island lies in about d m South It is inhabited by  Malayans  who are the original Natives They are of a middle Stature and tawny but the Women are of a brighter tawny than the Men and have long black Hair which reaches down to the Calfs of their Legs They have round Faces small Mouths Noses and Lips They wear a Linnen Wastecoat which reaches no lower than the lower part of their Breasts and about their middle they were a piece of Cloth about four Yards wide and a yard deep This they roul round them and it serves them instead of a Pettycoat For none are allowed to wear Pettycoats but the  Dutch  Women only Neither are any of the  Malayan  Men allowed to wear a Hat excepting only their King  Although the  Malayans  are the most numerous yet the  Dutch  are possest of all the SeaCoast and have here a strong Castle built of Stone and mounted with sixty Guns besides several other small Fortifications in other parts of the Island Near this Castle is a small Town of  map of island of Amboina  Fig XXXV  about a hundred  Dutch  Houses all well and strongly built of Stone Brick and Timber but all very low none exceeding one Story because of the many Earthquakes to which this place is very subject so that should they be built higher it would endanger the falling of them as they often do notwithstanding they are so low Whilst we were here we had a great Earthquake which continued two Days in which time it did a great deal of Mischief For the Ground burst open in many places and swallowed up several Houses and whole Families Several of the People were dug out again but most of them dead and many had their Legs or Arms broke by the fall of Houses The Castlewalls were rent asunder in several Places and we thought that It and all the Houses would have fallen down The Ground where we were swell'd like a Wave in the Sea but near us we had no hurt done  The Island is govern'd by a Council which consists of five Persons  viz  the Governour the Chief Merchant or upper Koopman the  Malayan  King the Captain of the Fort and the Fiscal who is in the Nature of a Judge Upon the Island are said to be about  Dutch  Soldiers with about or  Dutch  Freemen and PettyOfficers and near as many  Chinese  who live here for the advantage of Trade although they are not allowed to trade in Spice that being a peculiar Trade which the  Dutch  Company reserve to themselves So that I reckon they can make in all about five hundred and fifty fighting Men  Dutch  and  Chinese  As for the  Malayans  they would be of little Service to them but rather be glad to be assistant to any Body against them The  Malayan  Women here are said to be great Whores of which they are nothing ashamed They are soon ripe and often marry by nine Years of Age and many of them are said to have Children by ten or eleven All near the Waterside are forced to be under the  Dutch  Government which is very Absolute and Tyrannick over them For any small Fault they are severely handled and many think themselves well if they are not made Slaves and to wear an Iron upon their Leg during Life Those I say which dwell near the Seaside are all subject to the  Dutch  Government and are Christians But those within the Country which are called the Hill  Malayans  are Mahometans They are always at War with the  Dutch  And if they take one of them Prisoner at any time they never give him any quarter but after they have kept him in Prison five Days without either  Victuals or Drink they bring him out and first of all rip up his Breast with a sharp Knife and take out his Heart at which there is great rejoycing of all the  Malayans  that are present Then they cut off his Head and embalm it with Spice to keep And they who can show most of such Heads are accounted the most honourable and value themselves much upon it The dead Body is left exposed to the ravenous Birds of Prey to feed on The  Dutch  to retaliate this usage when they take any of these  Malayans  lade them with many Irons and lay them in Prison where they continue some time After which they cut off their Noses and Ears and then they are sent to Prison again where they continue some further time After which they are brought out the second and last time and they rack them till they die  As for those under their own Government if they are found guilty of thieving they often cut off their Noses and Ears and put a great Iron Chain upon their Legs and so make them Slaves during Life There were near five hundred of these poor Wretches who were in continual Slavery whilst we were here and they always took care to keep them employed some in sawing of Timber others in cutting of Stone some in carrying of  Burthens and other labour At Sunrising every Morning they are let out of the Prison in which they are kept the Men in one and the Women in another and are immediately sent to work where they continue till twelve at Noon at which time they return back and have an Hours time to dine Their Dinner is always the same being nothing but a Pint of course Rice boiled for each Man At One they are sent to work again where they continue till six in the Evening at which time they return again and go to Supper which is always the same both in quantity and quality as at dinner Soon after they have supp'd they are put into their Lodgings and lock'd in where they lie upon the bare Boards and have seldom any thing but a large piece of Wood which commonly serves five or six of them for a Pillow Sometimes these poor Wretches make shift to escape but if they are caught again they are sure to be severely handled There was One of these poor Slaves a Woman who had been severely used by the  Dutch  and having once made her escape and being taken again she knowing how severely she should be used cut her own Throat the Day before her appointed Punishment After which she was by the Hair dragged out of the Prison all round the Town  and then hung upon a Gibbet by her Feet with her Head downwards which is the common Punishment for any that are guilty of Selfmurther  Such as are in Debt and cannot satisfie their Creditors the Creditors turn over to the Company who send them to work amongst their Slaves They have nothing allowed them but Rice and Water as the other Slaves only they have twopence a Day given them towards the Payment of their Debts which avails but little So that it is very seldom if ever that any one gets out till he is carried out dead  But though the poor Natives are thus severely handled yet the  Dutch  themselves will wink at one anothers Faults so that it is a great Rarity for any one of them to be punished unless it be for Murther Otherwise a small matter of Money will buy off a great Fault  The Women that are Slaves to the Freemen have all the liberty that may be from their Masters and Mistresses only they are obliged every Night to bring them a certain Acknowledgement which is commonly about sixpence a Day and to find their own Victuals Cloths  c  In default of which they are severely used They may whore and Deal and all is well if the dayly Acknowledgment  be but brought and no Complaint be made against them  The chief of what this Island produces is Cloves Ginger Pepper Rattans Cams and some few Nutmegs  The CloveTree is not very great of Body but rather slender It is in length from twelve to thirty or forty foot The Branches are small the Leaves about five Inches long and two broad and end tapering One of these Leaves rubb'd between the Fingers will smell very strong of Cloves but without rubbing they have no smell at all The Cloves grow just at the tip of the Branches ten twelve or fourteen in a Cluster They are first white then green then of a dark Coppercolour which is the time of their being ripe The manner of gathering them is to spread Cloths or Sheets round the bottom of the Tree for a good distance Then they shake the Tree and all the Cloves that are throughly ripe and fit to be gathered fall down The rest which are left upon the Tree they let hang for about six or seven Days Then they shake as many more of them off as are ripe and will fall This they do three four or five times till they are all down The usual time of gathering of them is in  October  and  February  Those which are ripe in  October  are called the Winter Clove  this being the end of their Winter and they are not accounted so good or strong as the other These they commonly preserve and put up in small Jarrs of about a quart of which they transport great quantities to several parts of the World Those which are ripe in  February  are called the SummerClove These are accounted much better and stronger than the former because these have the best part of the Summer to ripen in whereas the former have not above a Months fair Weather and all the rest is rainy and cloudy so that the Rays of the Sun cannot come to them It is the common receiv'd Opinion that Cloves Nutmegs Mace and Cinamon grow all upon one Tree but it is a great mistake These Trees commonly bear sixty seventy or eighty pound weight at a time and every six Years they are sure to have a double Crop There is a vast number of these Trees upon this Island which are very carefully looked after and a Register kept of them in the Company's Book They are numbred once every Year and beyond a certain number they will not let them encrease but cut them down and destroy them for fear of lessenning the Price All these Trees belong to the  Dutch  Company or to their Freemen But those that belong to the Freemen the Company sets them an allowance as to  their number And if any one rears up more than what the Company allows of he is severely fined and his Trees forfeited And whatsoever Cloves the Trees belonging to Freemen produce the Freemen are obliged to sell to the Company after the rate of  d  a pound So that properly all the Cloves upon the Island are ingrossed into the Companies Hands And if any Freeman or other sells or conveys away to the value of ten pounds all that he has in the World is forfeited to the Company and he to be made a Slave during Life The Inhabitants used formerly to put Cheats upon the  Dutch  in the Sale of their Cloves for it was common with them to put their Cloves in a large Sheet which they hung up by its four Corners under the Cieling of their House and upon the Floor right under the Cloves they would set a large Tub of fresh Water which the Cloves being very dry and of a hot Nature would by degrees draw up and make a large addition to their weight without being easily perceived But now the  Dutch  are grown too cunning for them For they always try them by giving them a small fillip with their Forefinger on the Head and then if the Clove be throughly ripe and no Deceit has been used the Head will break all in pieces like a piece of thin brittle Glass But if it has been wetted  then the Clove will be very tough and the whole Clove will sooner bend than the Head fly off  There are some few Nutmegs upon this Island the Trees of which are much like the Peach But they grow mostly at the Island  Banda  From whence two or three Shiploads are exported every Year The Fruit of this Tree consists of four Parts the first and outward Rind is like that of a green Walnut the second is dry and thin which we call Mace the third is a tough thin Shell like that of a Chesnut and the fourth is the Kernel included in the said Shell which we call Nutmeg  There are said to be upon this Island some Mines of Gold One of the  Malayans  showed me some of the Ore which he said was taken out of them But this he said was a great Crime and if the  Dutch  should know it he should be severely punished For this is an extraordinary Secret which as much as they can they keep from all  Europeans  Although as I said before they can raise about five hundred and fifty fighting Men upon this Island yet once every Year they are forced to spare a great many of their People which are sent away upon other Businesses For commonly on the th of  October  each Year eight or ten Days sooner or later the Governour  of this place goes his Progress attended with about seventy five Orambies some with a hundred some eighty some fifty and some forty Paddles apiece In each of which go two  Dutch  Soldiers I reckon there may be in this whole Fleet of  Dutch  about or and about  Malayans  reckoning seventy  Malayans  to each Oramby one with another These seventyfive Orambies are divided into three Squadrons The first consisting of twenty Orambies which Squadron is always commanded by one of the Council who carries a yellow Flag The Rear consists of twenty more and is commanded by the Fiscall who commonly carries a red Flag The rest are in the middle Squadron and attend the Governour who hath twelve  Dutch  Soldiers a Corporal and a Serjeant for his Bodyguard and carries a blew Flag The Governour carries with him the  Indian  King and all their Princes for fear they should rebel in his Absence In this Order they go and visit all these Eastern Islands but especially those that do or would produce Cloves or Nutmegs And at every Island they go to they have an additional strength The time of their cruizing in this manner is commonly six Weeks in which time they cut down burn and destroy all the Clove and Nutmeg Trees they can find excepting such as  are reserved for the Companies use For all or most of these Islands do or would produce Cloves But they will not suffer them because they have enough to supply all  Europe  at  Amboyna  alone and even there also as I said before they will permit but a certain number least a Plenty of them should lower the price Upon all these Islands the  Dutch  Company keeps Soldiers three six nine or twelve according as they are in bigness Whose only business it is to see the Trees cut down or at least to take care they do not encrease For they are very jealous least the  English  or  French  should serve them such a Trick as they themselves formerly served the  English  at  Amboyna  During the time of their thus cruizing they gather Tribute from all the petty Kings and Princes of these Islands and commonly at the end of about six Weeks return again  Of Beasts here are several sorts as Beeves Hogs wild Deer  c  Of Fowls here are also several sorts as the  Crockadore  the  Cassawaris  the  Bird of Paradice c  The  Crockadore  is a Bird of various sizes some being as big as a Hen and others no bigger than a Pidgeon They are in all parts exactly of the shape of a Parrot Their Feathers are all over white excepting only a Bunch upon their Head  which is always either yellow or red This Bunch of Feathers lies so close fitted into a dent in the Head that they cannot be perceived unless when the Bird is frighted and then he sets it up an end and it spreads open like a Fan The Flesh and Legs of this Bird are quite black and they smell very sweet When thy fly wild up and down the Woods they will call  Crockadore Crockadore  for which reason they go by that name  The  Cassawaris  See Fig XXXVI  is about the bigness of a large  Virginia  Turkey His Head is the same as a Turkeys and he has a long stiff hairy Beard upon his Breast before like a Turkey He hath two great Legs almost as thick as a Man's Wrist with five great Claws upon each Foot He has a high round Back and instead of Feathers only long Hairs and the same upon the Pinions of his Wings It lays an Egg so big that it will hold a Pint The Shell is pretty thick spotted with green and white and looks exactly like Chinaware I never tasted the Eggs but the Bird it self is extraordinary good Victuals as I have tried several times It tastes very like a Turkey but much stronger  The  Birds of Paradice  are about the bigness of a Pidgeon They are of various Colours and are never found or seen alive neither is it known from whence  depiction of cassawaris  Fig  A Cassawaris  depiction of sea porcupine  Fig  A Sea Porcupine  they come I have seen several of them here embalm'd with Spice which preserves them from decay And so embalm'd they are sent as Rarities to several parts of the World It is related of these Birds that when the Nutmegs are ripe which is in the Months of  February  and  March  they resort to the Places where they grow  viz  to  Banda  and this place and eat off the outerrind of the Nut After which they fall down dead drunk and an innumerable Company of Ants gather about them and feed upon them and kill them  Of Fish here are also several sorts but the most noted is the  SeaPorcupine  See Fig XXXVII  It is in length about three foot and two foot and a half round It has a very large Eye with two Fins on his Back and one large one on each side near his Gills It is very full of sharppointed Quills which are hard stiff Bones and from thence is called the  SeaPorcupine  Of Fruits here are Plantains Bonanoes PineApples  c  The PineApple grows upon a low shrub with prickly Leaves They are so big that they will commonly weigh two pound and two pound and a half When it is ripe it is yellow and red without and full of little Bunches within it is yellow and so juicy that when you bite it the Juice will run down your Chin and Clothes and the Liquor  is very cool and pleasant Before they eat it they commonly rub it well with Salt and so let it lye for about an Hour which takes away the rawness of it then they wash it in fresh Water and eat it But One is sufficient for two or three People For they are very apt to cause Feavers  Here is also another sort of Fruit called a  Mangoe  It is about the bigness of our common Cucumber The outside altho' ripe looks green and within it is very yellow It is a very delicious Fruit when ripe and has a fine fragrant smell When they are green they cut them in two pieces which they pickle and send to most parts of the World They grow upon a Tree about the bigness of our common Appletree  This Island of  Amboyna  is sandy all round but the Water is so deep that there is no anchoring near it but at the  Ley  which is at the Westend of the Island in forty fathom Water close to the shore and in the common Harbour This Harbour runs up a great way into the Island and almost divides it into two Parts so that they are almost two Islands being only joined by a small Neck of Land so narrow that the  Malayans  often haul their Canoas over At the entrance into the Harbour on the Eastside there  is a small Fortification of about six Guns and close to it is twenty fathom Water And about a league further up is the Harbour for Ships where they lie under the Command of their great Castle which ever since the Massacre of the  English  has been called the Castle  Victoria  About two Miles further to the North East within the Harbour is the place where formerly our  English  Factory was settled and near it is said to be the Hole into which all the  English  were thrown after they had been massacred by the  Dutch  There were few of us now here but expected the same Fate and some of the Inhabitants were no way shy to tell us that the Journal which was sent in the  Dutch  Ships that we met going out hence for  Batavia  was our Protection For they were sensible that upon those Ships arrival at  Batavia  it would be presently known that a part of Captain  Dampier  's Company was arrived at  Amboyna  and from thence it would spread all over  India  and so they knew if we fared otherwise than well we should be enquired after  A little to the Eastward of this Island are several other small Islands the most noted and biggest of which are  Boangbessey  and  Hinomoa  They lie East from  Amboyna  at a small distance They are of an indifferent height and not above a third  part so big as the Island of  Amboyna  They are both pretty well fortified and produce store of Cloves But the chief place for Nutmegs is the Island of  Banda  which also belongs to the  Dutch  It lies in the Latitude of d m South and bears from  Amboyna  E S E distance Leagues The Island is said to be in form of a Man's Foot and Leg and to be pretty well fortified And as it has the preheminence for Nutmegs so  Amboyna  has for Cloves  The Governour of  Amboyna  is reckoned the Chief and HeadGovernour of all these SpiceIslands even to  Ternate  and  Tidore  which are also SpiceIslands in possession of the  Dutch  and lie about forty Miles to the Northward of the Equator  Whilst we were at this Island of  Amboyna  we were so much troubled with Moskitoes which are a sort of Gnats that every Night we were forced to put our selves in a Bag before we could go to sleep for otherwise these Creatures would so bite us that there was no sleeping And whereever they bite they commonly raised a red Blister almost as broad as a Silverpenny This would itch very much and many could not forbear scratching themselves so as to cause Inflammations which sometimes are the cause of the loss of a Limb  During our stay here we had the liberty of a broad paved Yard about sixty Yards square but by no means would they let us go out into the Town being very jealous of us and desirous to prevent as much as they could our knowing their Strength or making any other Discoveries which they thought might be prejudicial to them  Here we remained from the st of  May  to the th of  September  At which time there being three of the Companies Sloops ready to sail hence laden with Cloves twenty five of our Men were sent away with them for  Batavia  and we were ten of us left behind who were as they said to go in another Vessel which was almost ready to sail  It was very observable that all the time of our being here none of us fell sick or died For this was the S E or bad Monsoon which begins in the latter end of  April  and lasts till the latter end of  September  Most of which time we had hard Storms of Wind with much Thunder Lightning and Rain and the Weather so very cloudy that for six or seven Days together we saw not the Sun The greatest violence of this Weather is in  June July  and  August  and then it abates and at the latter end of  September  quite breaks up And then begins the westerly  Monsoon which is fine fair clear Weather with gentle Gales variable but mostly inclining to be Westerly This is counted the healthy Monsoon and the other the sickly one For in the Easterly Monsoon the Inhabitants are very much troubled with Feavers and Fluxes of which a great many die as vast numbers did whilst we were here especially of the  Malayan  Inhabitants who are more apt to die of them than the  Dutch  but I suppose the reason is because they are not so well provided with Doctors and Medicines as the  Dutch  neither are they so well looked after They admired at us seeing we were fed with such bad Diet and but newly come from Sea very weak that we could bear up under so many Hardships and Inconveniences and it used to be their common Saying  That nothing of Hardships or sickly Places would kill the  English  so long as they had any Victuals to eat  The Reason why I have given so little account of the Winds and Seasons of the Year in this whole Voyage is because these things are so well described in Capt  Dampier  's d Volume But he not having spoken much of these  Moluccoes  or SpiceIslands I have therefore endeavoured to give the more particular Account of them  On the th of  September  a  Malayan  Man was brought in here at  Amboyna  to the Statehouse to be tryed for his Life He was accused by his own Wife for murthering his Slave The Slave had been dead about six Months and she had concealed it but happening to fall out with her Husband she went before the Fiscal in the Heat of her Anger and declared it So her Husband was put in Prison and the Corps of the dead Slave dug up But it being consumed and rotten no Marks of any Violence could be perceived upon it and it was generally believed that the Man's Wife accused him wrongfully He was upon his Tryal when the Earthquake happened At which time I observed that it is a common Error to suppose that during an Earthquake it is always calm For we had a fine fresh Gale at S S W both Days on which the Earthquake happened This Earthquake made all the Court break up being in fear the House would fall on their Heads So the Man was committed to Prison again and the next Day being  September  the th about at Noon the Court being set again the Man was again brought to his Tryal when in about a quarter of an Hour when his Wife was in her greatest violence against him the Earth shook very much again and caused them all to break up  the second time The same Day my self with four more of our Men were sent on board a  China  Sloop for  Batavia  How they proceeded further with the Man I know not But many thought it a great token of his Innocency that the two several Earthquakes happened the two several Days just at the time of his Trial The other five of our Men which were left behind they promised should be sent after us in a short time but we never heard of them after  CHAP X  Departure from  Amboyna  and arrival at the Island of  Lancas  The Islands  Cabeses  The Island  Bouton  The Island  Celebes  The Passages between

Latitude and the Reason of it The Islands of  Faro  Return Home  FROM  Amboyna  we steered away S W by W till we came to the Island  Lancas  and in our way passed by the Island  Amblow  of which I have already spoken The Island  Lancas  is a short low Island on which is store of Wood It is not inhabited and all round it for a good distance is said to be shole Water It lies in the Latitude of d m South and I made Meridian distance ftom  Amboyna  Miles or d m West  From hence we steered W by N for a small time till we came up with the two Islands  Cabeses  Where it falling calm we sent our Boat ashore to the Eastermost of them and cut down some Hundreds of Coconuts which we carried on board This was also a low Island not inhabited but all round full of Coconuttrees which are planted here on purpose for the use  of such  Dutch  Ships and Vessels as pass by here for  Batavia  For it is a great Rarity to see any  European  shipping here besides the  Dutch  Off this Island we met our Bark which had brought us from  America  to  Amboyna  The  Dutch  after they had taken her from us fitted her up put a MizenMast in and made a very good Vessel of her This Island lies in the Latitude of d m South and nearly W by N from the Island  Lancas  distance about Miles It is shole two Miles from the Shore To the S W of this is the other Island of  Cabeses  which is a pretty high Island and upon it the  Dutch  always keep six Soldiers and a Corporal who two or three times a Year go round the Island to see that no Cloves be planted and if there be they cut them down and burn them for fear least any other Nation should take it from them which if they should I am apt to believe  Amboyna  would be of little use to them Cloves being the only Product valuable upon it  From hence we passed by the Southpart of the Island  Bouton  which lies in the Latitude of d m South It is a pretty large Island taking up above a degree and half in Latitude  From hence we steered to the Westward and passed between the Island  Celebes  and the Island  Zalayer  The Southpart  of the Island  Celebes  is very high Land It is very well inhabited and is a very large Island taking up seven degrees in Latitude At the Southend of this Island on the Westside the  Dutch  have a Factory called  Macasser  where they have a Fort of about seventy Guns mann'd with six or seven hundred  Dutch  Soldiers The chief Product of the Place is Rice with which they supply all or most of their Eastern Islands Here are also said to be several Goldmines of which the  Dutch  are not yet masters For the Inhabitants are often at War with the  Dutch  and pretty well defend those Places  Between the Southend of the Island  Celebes  and the Island  Zalayer  are three small low Islands and the best Passage is between that which lies next to the Island  Zalayer  and a little small one which lies to the Northward of That This is called the second Passage from  Zalayer  and is accounted the best For in the first Passage from  Zalayer  are many sholes but in this second it is deep Water The third and fourth are also deep but if you go through with the Seawind you will be so nigh the shore of  Celebes  that you must be forced to anchor till the Landwind comes Wherefore the second is always accounted the best Passage and most Ships rather than go through the first  third or fourth will lie a whole Day to go through the second which they do as commonly in the Night as in the Day there being no danger  The Island  Zalayer  is of a moderate height It is inhabited by  Malayans  and planted all round with Coconuttrees The Inhabitants are forced yearly to send store of Oil and Match to the  Dutch  at  Macasser  as a Tribute  From hence we steered W by N having had the Wind in the Eastern Quarter ever since we left  Amboyna  till we had passed a dangerous shole called the  Brill  and then we haul'd up S W and in the Night saw a small Island just by us which finding we could not weather we tack'd and stood the other way till Daylight and then finding our selves to the Southward of the said Island we tackt and stood to the Southwestward and soon after saw two other small low Islands bearing from the North to the Northwest We could see the Ground very plain for about two Miles and never had above six or under five fathom Water though it looked as if there was not above two fathom We came over this shole about a league to the Southward of the said two small Islands and this is accounted the narrowest part of the Shole for further to the Southward it is five or six Leagues  over But There also there is no danger because you have very even Soundings as five or six fathom seldom over or under But to the Northward of these two Islands it is very dangerous it being all very foul rocky Ground and in some places not above four or five foot Water Therefore be sure to go to the Southward of these Islands and you will be safe Although the  Dutch  in most of their Maps unless in such as they give to their own People have laid down the Dangers to the Southward which should have been laid down to the Northward of the two Islands And the safe sholes which we and they always go over they have laid down to the Northward of the two Islands whereas we and they also went over to the Southward of them We had a Draught on board belonging to the Captain of the Vessel which showed all this very exactly as we found it I compared it with several others which were on board and found a great deal of Difference I asked the Captain the reason of their Difference and he told me that the  Hollanders  knew all the sholes and dangerous places hereabouts very well but did not desire that any Body else should know them So that if any Foreigner should come into these Parts amongst these sholes and sail by their  Draughts they thinking all safe might unexpectedly be amongst Rocks and Sholes where they would certainly lose their Ship as we had done if we had sailed by the common Draughts It being the  Dutch  Policy to keep all Ships belonging to the  English  or  French  as far off these Eastern Islands as they can or at least if any do chance to come amongst them and happen into their Hands as we did to take care to send them away from among them and to let them know as little of them as may be  On the th of  October  we passed by the  Dutch  Factory called  Rambang  and on the st arrived in the Harbour of  Batavia  Here we were sent ashore to the BombKey to the rest of our Men who had been sent hither before and were not yet cleared And soon after the Major of the Castle was sent to us and desired we would send to the General by him an Account of our Losses and Damages which we received by our being taken at  Amboyna  and that we should be satisfied upon all Accounts both as to our lost Things loss of Time and Imprisonment Accordingly we each of us drew up an account of our Losses and sent it by the Major to the General who return'd us answer that very speedily we should have Satisfaction and our Freedom On the  th of  October  we were all sent for to the Fort and most of our ready Money was return'd to us again but for our Goods loss of Time and Imprisonment we could have no Satisfaction Only the General told us he had given us all that the Governour of  Amboyna  had sent to him and that if there was any thing more he knew nothing of it and that we were now at our liberty to go where we pleased We desired that since our Vessel was taken from us by the Company of which He was the Head he would be pleased to take care to find us some Ship in which we might return home which he promised he would We were forced to be content and went and took Lodgings in the Town till we could meet with an opportunity of returning home  And now being at a stop here for a while I shall give some Description of this North Coast of  Java  The Island is in length East and West about ten Degrees And from the East end of  Madura  to this Port of  Batavia  you have the common Land and Sea Winds In the Easterly Monsoon the Landwinds are at South East sometimes more Southerly and the Seawinds at North East fine pleasant Gales This Easterly Monsoon is accounted the good Monsoon it being fine fair clear Weather beginning in  April  and  ending in  October  But the Westerly Monsoon is called the bad Monsoon being rainy and blustering weather with much Thunder and Lighting especially in  December January  and  February  This bad Monsoon begins in  November  and ends in  March  or the beginning of  April  In it the Landwinds are at West South West and South West and the Seawinds at North West and West North West The Anchorground all along the North side of  Java  from the Island  Madura  to  Batavia  is brave oazey Ground and clear of Rocks The principal places on this side of the Island are  Batavia Bantam Japara Samarang Surabon Taggall  the  Quale  and  Rambang  All these places are settled by the  Dutch  They afford Rice with which they supply all their Outfactories hereabouts as also very good Plank to build Shipping with The chief place of building is  Rambang  where the Freemen go to build their small Vessels as Sloops and Brigantines Also several Ships of five six or seven hundred Tuns lade with Timber at  Rambang  the  Quale Japara  c And each Ship when full taketh a great Raft of the largest of the Timber in a tow to  Batavia  Some of these Rafts are said to be thirty foot square and to draw twentytwo foot water There are commonly fix of these  Ships which thus lade with Timber and they commonly make four Voyages in the good Monsoon For in the bad they cannot do any thing All this Timber is commonly landed upon a small Island between four and five leagues from  Batavia  where the ShipCarpenters are usually kept at work nay they are said to be never out of Employ They are about two hundred in number and the Island is called  Ʋnrest  a very fit name for it for here is said to be no rest for an idle person The  Dutch  careen all their Ships here and it is very well fortified being all round a Bed of Guns  Batavia  is the chief place the  Dutch  have in  India  receiving by Shipping the Product of  India Japan  and  China  It is inhabited by several sorts of people as  Dutch Portuguese Chinese Persians  and  Negroes  but the  Malayans  are the Natives The  Dutch  are Masters of the place and have a very fine large Town in which are seven Churches  Dutch Portuguese Malays  and  Chinese  with several very fine spacious Houses built after the European manner The Town is all walled and moted round and upon the Walls are planted store of Cannon In the middle of the Town in a great square place is a very sine and handsome Statehouse where all Affairs are transacted  The Town with all the Fortifications is commonly governed by one of the States of  Holland  who has the Title of General of  India  and all other Governours are subordinate to him The Inhabitants here do not care how often they change their General For at the coming of a new one all Prisoners are released excepting such as have committed murther He has twelve to assist him who have always the Title of  Raids  or Lords of  India  These are such as have been formerly chief Governours in several places in  India  as of  Ceylon Amboyna Malacca  c The Town is divided by Rivers over which almost in every Street there are Bridges laid and Bombs to haul across which let no Boats go in or out after Sunset  At this place grows the  TamarindTree  whose Leaves shut and open according to the rising and setting of the Sun And much like this is another Tree that buds in the night and as the Sun rises blooms a Flower almost like a Lilly So that the Tree will be full of these Flowers by noon and when the Sun is down within half an hour the Flowers will be all fallen off and not one left upon the Tree This I have seen daily  The chief Product of the place is Pepper of which the  Dutch  yearly export  great Quantities Here are also some few Diamonds and other rich Gems  Of Fruits here are Plantains Bonanoes Oranges Lemons Pomegranates Mangastans and Rumbostans  The  Mangastan  is about the bigness of a GoldenRunnet It is quite round and looks like a small Pomegranate The outside Rind is like that of a Pomegranate only of a darker colour But the inside of the Rind is of a fine red Within this Rind is the Fruit which is of a fine white and lies in Cloves almost like Garlick There are commonly four or five of these Cloves in each and they are very soft and juicy Within the Cloves is a small black Stone We commonly suck the Fruit from the Stone And the Fruit is very delicious the Stone we throw away being very bitter if chewed  The  Rumbostan  is about the bigness of a Walnut when the green Peel is off It is also much of the shape of the Walnut And hath a prety thick tough outerrind which is of a deep red and is full of little knobs of the same colour Within the Rind is the Fruit which is quite white and looks almost like a Jelly And within the Fruit is a large Stone It is very delicate Fruit and though a Man eat never so much yet it never does him any harm provided he swallows the Stones  as well as the Fruit But otherways they are said to cause Fevers  But this place is so well known to most Europeans that it needs no further Description  On the second of  December  all of us which had a desire to return to  England  were ordered on board the  Dutch EastIndia  Fleet And the next Day the whole Fleet consisting of about twelve Sail weigh'd anchor and left  Batavia  On the th we arrived at  Bantam  where we wooded water'd and refresh'd our selves and took in store of Provisions as Beeves Hogs  c  for our supply during our Passage to the Cape This is also a  Dutch  Factory and the chief Trading is for Pepper On the th we weigh'd from  Bantam  The Westerly Monsoon was set in pretty hard against us But however having a strong Current setting to the Windward we made shift to turn against the Monsoon Yet it commonly blowing very hard at Night whilst we were in the Streights of  Sunda  we used to run in under the  Java  shore and there anchor till the next Morning All through these Streights the Coast is good and bold and though there be many Sholes yet the Soundings are good even in the most dangerous place which is between  Bantam  and  Batavia  But no Man will venture to  sail by Night although it sholeth gradually near any Bank and the Anchorground is very good that Ships can stop when they please if they are plying to Windward  On the th we came up with a small high Island called  Princes Island  It lies at the Westend of this Streight of  Sunda  And from hence we took our departure for the  Cape of Good Hope  We had nothing material happen'd to us in this our Passage And we arrived at the Cape on the d of  February  having been just two Months in our passage And here we found four Ships belonging to our  EastIndia  Company  The  Cape of good Hope  is the Southermost part of  Africa  situated four Degrees and a half within the Southern Temperate Zone Near it is the Table Bay a very healthy place and producing all Necessaries for the Life of Man The  Dutch  are Masters of this place and have here a Fort of about fifty Guns which they were now about moting round Half a mile to the Westward of the said Fort they have belonging to them a pretty Town consisting of about a hundred and fifty  Dutch  Houses and a small Church situated under a very high Mountain called the  TableLand  The Town and Fort are under a Governour and a Fiscal who as I have said before is in the nature of a Judge  The Natives of this Place are a tawny swarthy sort of People who call themselves  Hodmandods  and are certainly the next to Beasts of any People on the face of the Earth Both Men and Women are of a middle Stature with small Noses little Mouths and Eyes and an oval Face They have a woolly Head of Hair like the  Guinea  or  AngolaNegroes  Both Men and Women cover themselves with only two raw Sheeps Hides just as they come from the Sheeps Back In the Day they wear them like a Mantle over their Shoulders and in the Night when they sleep one of them serves to lie under them instead of a Bed the other to cover them And thus like Beasts they lie Men Women and Children the whole Family together They smear or grease themselves very much which makes them stink abominably And the thicker they are with Grease the more they are admired by one another The Women to distinguish themselves from the Men wear dried Thongs of the Sheeps Skins rouled round their Legs from the Ankle to the Knee which makes their Legs seem as big as Posts and they look'd like a Rowl of Tobacco They also wear a long Cap made of the same which goes up tapering like a Piramid But their clothing is the same as the Mens  viz  two raw Sheeps  Skins They are a very shameless ignorant People and as far as I could perceive without any Laws or Government of their own only each Family is subject to the eldest of their Family Both Men and Women are great Lovers of Tobacco and for two or three ounces of it a Man will not stick to prostitute his Wife to any  European  whatsoever The Men are not at all jealous and care not how many  Europeans  lye with their Wives yet they will beat their Wives severely if they know them to lye with any of their own Nation besides themselves They are a People that will eat any soul or nasty thing For if the  Dutch  kill a Beeve or a Sheep they will beg the Guts out of which they squeeze the Dung and without washing or any cleaning at all cut them into small peices and lay them upon the fire and assoon as they are hot through take them off and eat them  Their Children when they are young are something inclining to be White and were it not for their nasty way of greazing them they would make likely Men and Women For they are most of them very well featured The  Dutch  did formerly what they could to bring them to the knowledge of the true God and to leave their nasty way of living  but never could prevail with them they still desiring rather to live like Beasts Worship they seem to have none except at the full Moons and then they Dance and Sing all or most of the Night and the brighter the Moon is the more is their Mirth For then they think the Moon which seems to be their God is wellpleased with them But if the Moon chance to be obscured with Clouds then they seem much dejected and fancy their God is angry with them  I was told a story by the Person with whom I lodged here that some years since the  Dutch  sent two of these  Hodmandod  Men to  Holland  where they were very well cloathed had a good maintenance allowed them and for the space of four years were sent up and down to see the several parts of  Holland  and other Countries adjacent The  Dutch  thinking this would be a means of bringing them to a more civilized way of living But it proved ineffectual For the two  Hodmandods  at their return as soon as they got ashore tore off all their Cloaths and returned to their old beastly way of living  These people have low Matt Houses in form of a Beehive The Door not above three foot high and the highest part of the House about six foot high In the middle of which in cold weather they make a Fire and the whole Family Men Women and Children and their Dogs all lie round it where they sleep as sound as other people do in their Beds of Down Yet these people are as healthy and as free from Pains and Aches as any on the whole Continent of  Africa  Their Housholdgoods are seldom any thing more than two earthen Pots one broken the other whole The broken Pot serves them instead of a Fryingpan and the other to boil their Victuals in  They are no way ingenious neither do they follow any Trades The most of their delight is in looking after Flocks of Sheep and in this the  Dutch  often employ them If one of them does half an hours work for a  Dutchman  or any  European  he will demand a Doublekey which is a piece of Money that goes for Twopence And if there be occasion to work him from morning till night he will demand no more  The Land hereabouts is very mountainous and the Mountains are most of them very barren producing only a few small shrubby Bushes And within the Country  are abundance of Lions Tygers wild Elephants  c  These wild Beasts the  Dutch  kill after this manner They make a pretty large Circle upon the edge of which they fix five six seven or eight Posts about eighteen or twenty foot from each other Upon each of these Posts is a Musket made fast the Muzles of which are all placed so as to point to the Center of the Circle The Muskets are well loaded and from the Trigger of each Musket is a small Line reaching to the Center of the said Circle and there fastned to a piece of raw Flesh which when a wild Beast seizes upon most or all of the Muskets go off and seldom fail to kill him Any one that kills a Lion is paid by the Publick fiftytwo Guilders which amounts to four Pound six Shillings and eight Pence And for killing a Tyger he has a Reward of twentyfour Guilders or forty Shillings There was a  Scotchman  whilst we were here who killed four Lions three Tygers and three wild Elephants for which he had his Reward according to the aforesaid Proportion  This place produces several sorts of Fruits both common and not common to us in  Europe  as Pomgranates Watermelons Chesnuts with some few Plantains and Bonanoes and store of very good Grapes of which the  Dutch  make a very  pretty and pleasant Wine in great quantities which by Retale is commonly sold at eight Pence a Quart It also produces abundance of GardenFruit which is very refreshing to those that arrive here sick of the Scurvy  Of Beasts here are great store  to wit  Lions Tygers Elephants  c  which all run wild up and down the Country but near the Towns they are seldom seen Here are also abundance of Sheep very large and I think as good Meat as ever I eat  Of Fowls here are also several sorts But the most noted as I think is the Ostridge which is a very large Fowl The Bird it self is little valuable but for its Feathers which are sent as Rarities to several parts of the World Their Eggs are very good Meat as I have experienc'd many times That these Birds do feed upon Iron Stones or any thing that chances to be near them is fabulous but like a great many other Fowls they peck up small Stones which only serve to digest their proper Food They are of several colours as black white  c  Of the Sea Inhabitants the most noted is the Seal or as the  Dutch  call it the  SeaHound  They are the same as those before spoken of at the Island  Juan Fernandoes  only the Furr of these is not so fine  In this Harbour on the South side are two great high noted Mountains the one called the TableLand which is pretty plain and even at the top and the other called the Sugarloaf from its shape At the top of this Sugarloaf the  Dutch  have a small House and four Guns mounted Here they always keep a Lookout and at the approach of any Ship or Ships hoist a Flag and fire as many Guns as they see Ships to give notice to those at the Town  During our stay here there arrived some more  EastIndia  homeward bound Ships both  Dutch  and  English  also here we met with some of our Men that had left us in the Gulf of  Nicoya  and went away with our Chiefmate They gave us an account that in a Week after they left us they went into the Port of  Ria Leon  on the Coast of  Mexico  where they took two  Spanish  Ships at Anchor one of which being very old and wormeaten they immediately sunk Which being done they sent two of their Prisoners ashore with a Letter to the Governour in which they demanded Dollars for the ransome of the other Prize The Governour sent them word that the Owners of the said Ship were poor and that the Town was also poor so that they could not give so much  but if Dollars would satisfie them he would send them aboard the next day upon our Mens word that upon the receipt of the Money they would deliver up the said Prize They answered that they wanted Provisions and Water and therefore whatever was found in the said Prize either Eatable or Drinkable should not be comprehended in the Bargain To this the Governour readily agreed and sent the Money And assoon as the Provisions could be got out of her she was according to agreement delivered up From thence our Men went to the Gulf of  Salinas  and haul'd their Vessel ashore and clean'd and refitted her And from thence with all the haste they could they proceeded on their Voyage for  India  and in fifty four Days reached the  Philippine  Islands having kept all the way in the Latitude of d North Amongst the  Philippine  Islands a Canoa came off to them with a  Spanish  Priest in her Him they detained and sent the Canoa ashore for some fresh Provisions as a ransom for the said Priest which accordingly was sent to them and they released the priest From thence they went to the Island  Pulo Condore  but sinding the  English  all cut off they went for  Mocoa  in  China  where after they had given an account from whence they came  they every one dispersed some for  Goa  to serve the  Portugueze  some to  Benjar  to the  English  and others to serve the  Mogull  On the th of  March  we having refitted our Ships and refreshed our Men and taken in store of fresh Provisions and there being a fresh Gale of Wind at S E we all weigh'd from the Cape and went out between  Penguin  Island and the Main Land having the Main on the Starboardside and the Island  Penguin  on the Larboard This is a pretty low sandy Island In the middle of which upon the highest part of it they have a few Guns mounted and near them a Flagstaff on which at the approach of any Ship they hoist a Flag and fire a Gun to give notice to the Town This Island takes its name from a vast number of Birds called  Penguins  which commonly resort near it These Birds are about the bigness of a Wild Duck They do not fly but flutter having no Wings but only stumps like young Ducks and these stumps are instead of Fins to them when they are in the Water They have a sharp Bill but Feet like a Duck and their Flesh is but mean Victuals  We were now twentyfour Sail of us  viz  nine  English  and fifteen  Dutch  and the Gale continuing soon carried us into  the true Trade We met with nothing material till the th of  April  when two of the  English  Ships sailing very heavy fell a stern and lost our Company They put into St  Hellena  and as we hear since were taken out of the Road by the  French  On the th we had twenty five Hogs killed for the Ships Company and the Commodore ordered a Hog to a Mess that is to every seven Men to dispose of as we pleased besides our daily Allowance so that we had more Victuals than we could tell what to do with  On the th a Man being barbarously murthered on Board the  Dutch  ViceAdmiral the Murtherer was brought on Board our Ship and tryed for his Life and the same day condemned to dye He owned he did the Murther and desired the favour of the Court that he might chuse his Death which was granted and he chose to be Shot which the next day was accordingly done all the Fleet lying by till his Death and then we all made sail again  On the th we saw the Island of  Ascension  but did not touch here for Turtle although it was their laying time the reason was because we were so well provided with Provisions at the Cape that we had no occasion for more and  the  English  Ships being willing to keep us Company they also did not touch here  On the th we had fine fair Weather with a fresh Gale at South East About eleven this morning happened a great Earthquake At first it seemed as if the Ship run along upon the Ground So we heaved out a Lead on each side with two hundred fathom of Line but found no ground The whole Fleet felt the Shock at the same time so that for half a quarter of an hour there was nothing but making of Signals and firing of Guns We then reckoned the Island of  Ascension  to bear South East distant about forty Leagues  Hence we steered away to the North Westward and on the th of  June  saw four Sail of  French  Privateers They lay a while and viewed us but did not think fit to come amongst us  On the th we found our selves in the Latitude of d m North which was the furthest to the Northward that I ever was And here I could not but take notice of the difference of cold in this place and in d of Southern Latitude For there we had continual Showers of Snow or Hail and the weather very cold whereas here on the contrary we found the Weather very fair and moderate  The reason of which I suppose was this When we were to the Southward we were always pretty near to the Main of  America  having it to the West of us Likewise when we were to the Northward we were always pretty near the main Land of  Europe  having it to the East of us Now being near the Land we always account the Landwinds to be the coldest and the Seawinds the warmest Thus the North Easterly Wind is accounted the coldest Wind we have in  England Holland  c But in the same Latitude North near the Coast of  America  the North West Wind is commonly accounted the coldest And in the same height of South Latitude on the Coast of  America  the South West Wind is the coldest As near the Cape of good Hopo the South East Wind is the coldest Now the Westerly Winds at such a height both in North and South Latitude having generally the Predominancy over the Easterly very much alter the degrees of the heat or cold of the Weather For which reason in the South part of  America  the Westerly Wind caused cold Weather but to the Northward the Westerly wind caused warm Weather And as the Easterlywind being near the  European  shore is the coldest so being near the  American  shore in the same height of Southern  Latitude the Westerlywind is the coldest  On the d of  July  in the Evening we saw the Islands of  Faro  bearing East by North distant about eleven or twelve Leagues We also sounded but had no ground at two hundred and ten fathom At twelve at Night we had ground at eightyfive fathom and at three the next morning at seventy fathom On the th of  July  at noon the opening of the two Islands of  Faro  bore South East distant about eight Leagues We then steering North East and ground at eighty fathom small pieces of broken Shells All last Night we kept firing a Gun once every half hour to give notice to the Cruizers whom we expected to meet here  On the th according to our Expectations we met with our Convoy which had been cruizing for us They consisted of eight  Dutch  Men of War four Victualers and three of the Companies Privateers After Mutual Salutations we proceeded to the South Eastward being all bound for  Amsterdam  And on the th of  July  we all arrived safely in the  Texel  and on the th got to  Amsterdam  where we continued a while After which my self and the rest of our Company went to see the several parts of  Holland  as  Delf Rotterdam  the  Hague  c  And on the th of  August  after many Dangers both by Sea and Land we happily arrived in  England  being but eighteen out of one hundred and eightythree which went out with us  FINIS  INDEX  A  ACapulco  P and T  p  Acapulco  Ship See  Manila  Ship  Acary  P    Ahoreados  Rocks    Ajuta  Point    Albicore  F
