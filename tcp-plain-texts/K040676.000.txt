 THE LIVERPOOL PRIZE A FARCE IN TWO ACTS AS IT PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN WITH UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE WRITTEN BY F PILON  LONDON PRINTED FOR T EVANS NEAR YORKBUILDINGS STRAND MDCCLXXIX  Price One Shilling  PREFACE  IT having been insinuated that the Liverpool Prize was written in the spirit of party the author takes this opportunity of publicly declaring that nothing could be further from his intention than such an idea If the maritime phrases so often repeated on a late public occasion be deemed satire in disguise he confesses himself too dull to find it out it was impossible to avoid using them in painting a sailor like Teneriffe but admitting they were selected in consequence of their being temporary the writer of the Liverpool Prize has done no more in using them than the best dramatic writers have done before him and indeed ought to continue to do if the stage be the mirror of the times Distinguished  as Shakespeare was and above the necessity of stooping to temporary allusions yet would he sometimes sacrifice to them in order to gratify the public a circumstance which has contributed not a little to that obscurity in his writings which has so long amused and perplexed the critics As to the liberty the author took in mentioning Admiral Keppel's name he hopes no man is so great an enemy to his country as to ascribe it to party it was the tribute of his heart an echo to the voice of a whole nation loud in praise of a man who had so often fought the battles of Old England with success and in whose hands the honour of the British flag can never tarnish  PROLOGUE  Written by the AUTHOR  Spoken by Mr LEE LEWES in the Character of a LotteryOfficeKeeper  Enters reading a playbill  THE Liverpool prize what are these folks still on  The twenty thousand paid Leland and Dillon  Pausing  I sold that number and insured it too  Aye prizes out of number 'tween me and you  Looking round with surprize  'Sdeath where am I What stumbled on the stage  No wonder that in this satyric age  Here marksman Wit shoots at all game that flies  One night a Nabobnext a Molesworth dies  Why even this I could suppose Guildhall  But that I miss the wheels and giants 'gainst the wall  Looking at the figures of tragedy and Comedy  Miss the giants from the earliest age  Those Ladies have stood Gog and Magog of the stage  Then round in expectation buyers sit  Before me the Commissioners in the Pit  Who meet in judgment on each musestruck vot'ry  And on these hustings Genius has its Lott'ry  All the world's a stageold Shakespeare declares  And all the men and women merely play'rs  Did Shakespeare's genius light the present day  All the world's a lott'ry I'm sure he'd say  What is the law but a deep scheme which tries  To pick your pocket of a swinging prize  Physic's another of which friends beware  For death and the doctor all the prizes share  We fix upon a number in a wife  And without luck we drawa blank for life  Unless indeed we take the wellbred course  T insure  at Doctors Commons by  divorce  The state by all's a lott'ry allow'd  The wheels of state you know'Sdeath I'm too loud  The lott'ry wheels good folks I mean to say  The wheels of state go always the right way  Yonder's the poet with a dismal face  Who would attempt to underwrite his case  If he thinks I will our poet here is bit  I never sign a policy on wit  Addressing the audience  Here is the only office can secure him  If you approve the town will then insure him  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  DEBENTURE an old Merchant  Mr QUICK  TENERIFFE a Guinea Captain

Debenture's  House  Enter  Fanny  and  Bronze  FANNY  AND you really think Mr Bronze that I believe what you tell me  Bron  Not I upon my soul I only hope you'll make your mistress believe it  Fan  Why have you no more conscience sirrah than to expect I'll tell my mistress lies for you  Bron  What else should you tell her hussy if you have a mind to keep your place A fine woman has nothing but lies told her from morning till night and expects nothing else from her lover or her chambermaid  Fan  Well I protest its enough to corrupt any  vartuous  girl to converse with your London  sarvants  Bron  Why I don't know but you are right Fanny especially if it be a  vartuous  girl like yourself who has beauty enough to be worth taking pains with  But tell me is your mistress drest How does she look in her uniform  Fan  Ay she is drest and if she'd take my advice she'd undress again  Bron  And my master's too but all in good time Fanny I am now come to tell you to be ready to let him in at the back stairs in about ten minutes he has a chaise and four ready and will whisk you and your mistress off you jade in  Fan  Hold hold my good friend won't the wheels of his carriage want a little greasingWhen I saw you both in Liverpool last you were not much encumbered with the weight of your purses  Bron  'Sdeath I had like to have forgot my principal argument with a chambermaid  Puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out a guinea  Look at this little smiling rogue we have two hundred of the same pattern and my master desired I would make a present of this to his good friend and my adorable Fanny as an earnest of future favours  Fan  Well I protest this is very pretty of him and I am sure I am glad that he's taking her off from that great ugly monster Teneriffe I have always said it was a pity they should not come together The lieutenant you know is her cousin he loves her and I'm sure there's no love lost indeed Mr Bronze If you have many such arguments Bronze as your last there will be no resisting you  Bron  Many hussey my master and I have an unlimited credit on the bank of Israel  Fan  The bank of Israel I never heard of such a bank in my life  Bron  It is a sign you are a good christian and never wanted money Abraham Jacob and Co are the only bankers we can draw upon now Heaven help us since I and my master became poor nobody but  infidels will credit usBut how is old Debenture Is he screwed up with the rheumatism or bound hand and foot with the gout  Fan  NeitherHe has both hands and feet at liberty and is now sitting with his constant companion Captain Teneriffe over his evening pipe  Bron  Is not that the great sea calf that is intended for our divine little Harriet  Fan  The very sameWell I protest Mr Bronze its enough to make one die with laughing to hear them both talk they rave of nothing but their privateer from morning till night and the prizes she's to bring in the only thing which troubles me is Captain Wilmot that's gone in herOh the sweet fellow He did not leave a dry eye in Liverpool when he went away I do believe he might have manned his ship with women if he had a mind  Bron  Well blundered my sweet little bullmakerLord how a pretty face does sanctify nonsense  Fan  Oh Mr Bronze you are such a wit there's no such thing as speaking before you you are so sophistical in your reflections  A bell rings  Dear me let me be gone there's my mistress's bell Let me go you devil or you'll ruin me  Bron  What at your years Fanny  Bell again  Fan  Pshaw let me go I beg of you  Bron  But first take this and this  kissing her  these are the only guineas I can give you now  Fan  But don't think I take them as sterling currency  Bron  If you did huffy I'd impeach you of high treason in the court of love and have you punished for clipping them  Exeunt  SCENE II  changes to a Parlour in the same House  Debenture  and  Teneriffe  discovered at a Table with Pipes and a Bowl of Liquor before them Midships in waiting  Ten  How is the wind Midships  Mids  It blows right in the harbour your honour  Deb  Then who knows but we may have them in tonight  Ten  Like enough  Deb  I have been thinking friend Teneriffe how many prizes she must have taken in the ten days she has been out Let me see nowshe has been out ten daysThe first day I remember was as fine a day as ever came out of the heavensBut then she could not have got very near the French coast the first day and if she took one it was not badNo no one was the most she took the first day  Mids  Stave in my head rails how you do talk  Ten  Avast Midships don't fire the chase guns too soon we'll bring him up with a wet sail presently  Deben  But what a terrible day was the second the chimney of the Golden Lion was blown down you may remember the circumstance very well for we were to have dined there and our dinner was spoilt by the accidenta fine goose was knockt of the spit by the fall of a brickbat a large pot with a plumb pudding in it clean overturned and the cook scalded in so terrible a manner she was obliged to be sent to the hospital  Ten  If only a dinner was overset in that day's gale brother Debenture we have no right to complain of  the weatherbut poor Sally I hope she rid it outEvery blast went to my heart  Mids  But what was that gale to the one we had in our last voyage to the coast of Guinea  Ten  Right Midships not a capfullDamme I had forgot that gale but do you remember our battle next day with the Spanish frigate  Ten  Do I We were upon the larboard quarter as it might be hereso I whips up my helm a weather shoots under her counter and we raked her fore and aft with a whole broadside of round double and grape  Deben  Oh now they have got fighting the Spaniards on the coast of Guinea we shan't have them in the Channel these two hours  Ten  Now friend Debenture an account of this battle is worth hearing  Lays down his pipe  Deben  Why you know you have told it to me above twenty times  Ten  Suppose this here bowl now do you see me the enemy and my pipe the Bonny  Mids  You know your honor we had got the weather gage of themnow this here tobaccopouch  Ten  Avast you lubber do you think I want your assistance to fight a ship  Deben  I wish to the lord this battle was well over for it threatens to prove a devilish obstinate one  Ten  The enemy I say bore right down upon us as this here bowl may do do you see  Drawing the bowl towards him spils the liquor  Deben  But my good friend don't overset our punch in the heat of the action you may chance to need it to recruit your spirits when the battle is over  Ten  We received two broadsides from her without firing a single shot till luffing up right under her stern  as you say Midships we raked her fore and aft the first broadside  Mids  Away went her mizenmast  Ten  Next goes the mainmast by the board  Mids  Grapple damme is the word and pepper them and in less than a shake of her main top fail there was not a stick of timber left standing between the poop lanthorn and the bees of her bowsprit  Deben  Zounds the fight grows devilish hot I had better get out of the way or I shall come in for my share of the action  Ten  Now we come close along side yard arm and yard arm clear the decks boys and Spanish gold was the word We boarded them with five and twenty choice hands and before you could upset a serving mallet we had every Spanish dog upon his beam end damn me  Mids  I see her strike Damme I see her strike  Deben  Heaven be praised for now I hope the battle is over  Ten  Ay midships the lubbers struck just as my boys found themselves in a trim for fighting  Mids  I never was so sorry for any thing in all my born days your honour  Deben  And I was never better pleased at any thing in the course of my life In the devil's name how long would you continue fighting  Ten  How long would we continue fightingWhat a question to ask an Englishman and a sailorHow long would we continue fighting Till the blood ran out of our scuppers till we had not a rag of canvass or a splinter of wood to hang it on ay damme till we had died and thenwhy we should have fought like Englishmen  Mids  You see master Debenture he understands a thing or two But come now the battle's over let us stow our grog  Takes the Bowl  Come here's the king Bless his heart I have lost two legs in his service  Ten  No no only one Midships  Mids  I say two one of 'em as hearty a piece of oak as ever was stumped upon I lent to a brother seaman and it was burnt in the fire at GreenwichHospital and the other was disabled by a two and forty pounder in the last war with as brave a fellow as ever pricked for his beef  Commodore Keppel  Deben  But hark'ee neighbour Teneriff suppose whilst you are fighting this Spanish frigate a pirate should take possession of your best prizeHave you forgot Harriet Did not I tell you that my graceless nephew George Belford it stationed here I wish from my heart he had been sent to fight the French that fellow it as dangerous amongst women as a kite in a henroost and will snap her up in spite of us if we have not our eyes about us  Ten  Odds bobs I had forgot my little frigate but suppose we croud all the sail we can for the port of matrimony there we shall have safe riding  Mids  Ay your honour if there's no damn'd squalls off Cuckold's Point  Exit  Mid  Deben  You shall marry her tomorrow neighbour Teneriffe for that rascal will stick at nothing to get her he'd hang his uncle for her sake ay his father if he's not hang'd already for heaven be praised he has not been heard of these eighteen years when he married my poor sister he was as wild and extravagant as that fellow now is  Enter  Jonathan  in haste  Jon  Oh they are come they are come they an come Sir  Deben  What the Charming Sally Is she come  Jon  Yes Sir yes Sir she and her prizes are all now laying at the quay  Deben  Here's news neighbour TeneriffeBut Jonathan my good lad did you reckon the prizes I hope you took care of that  Jon  I did try your worship but ecod there was so many of them I was always out before I had done counting but every body said there was not less than four French EastIndiamen a Spanish galleon laden with dollars and a snow from Bourdeaux full of excellent claret  Exit  Jon  Ten  Four French EastIndiamen prizes a galleon and a snow from BourdeauxDamme its impossible one of them would blow her our of the water  Deben  Why you'll believe nobody don't you hear every body say four EastIndiamen and a snow from Bourdeaux Only I know you love money I should suppose that you grudg'd yourself this piece of good fortunebut come we'll set of ourselves and see her  Ten  Not I I'll not budge the length of a handspike If she's coming in I shall be soon saluted with a message from the pilot  Deben  I am deaf I don't hear a word you say I won't believe a word you say for I'm determined to have the four EastIndiamen the galleon and the Bourdeauxman in spite of you and our enemies together This is all my boy Wilmot's doing my own nephew Russel Cloudesly WilmotDamme his very name was enough to make prizes of a whole fleet  Enter  Jonathan  Jon  Sir there's a sailor without who desires to see yon and Captain Teneriffe  Deben  Let him come in let him come in by all means    Exit  Jonathan  Now we shall see who is right we shall have some news now of the EastIndiamen and the galleonmind I say four besides the galleon and the Bourdeauxman  Enter  Breeze  Ten  What Breeze I am glad to see thee boy why you have brought 'em to I find  Breeze  Yet your honour we have made a trip that will lay us up safe in dock for the rest of our lives I have just stept out of the pilot boat sent by Captain Wilmot to tell you all aboard is well and that he'll have the prize at the dock in half an hour  Deben  The prizes you mean my good friend  Ten  He meant the prize I tell you Can't you be satisfied with one good one  Deben  Pr'y thee my honest fellow do you undeceive this obstinate man and let him know how many prizes you have taken  Breeze  How many we have taken  Ten  I'll stake my share against yours that he has taken but one tho' I believe that to be a good one from all the fuss that it made about it  Deben  Now have not you taken four EastIndiamen a galleon and a snow from Bourdeaux Answer me directly and stop the foolish man's mouth  Breeze  Four EastIndiamen a galleon and a snow  from Bonrdeaux Why zounds Sir do you think we had a squadron of first rates with us  Deben  Why I confess it was a very great capture but perhaps we have been misinformed as to the galleon however I am certain there can be no mistake as to the four EastIndiamen and the Bourdeauxmanthen I have as good as promised a tun of the claret to an acquaintance and sure you would not have me worse than my word  Breeze  Unship my binnacle I don't know what you'd be at  Ten  Why damme he'd have you take the whole French navy in a cockle shell  Breeze  Your honour it would be a damn'd hard thing to do that but if I had room to work my guns in one I'd engage to fight them till they either beat or sunk me  Ten  Well said my heart of oak But what prizes have you taken  Breeze  The third day we were out we took a Bourdeauxman laden with claret and sent her into Waterford in Ireland  Deben  I am very glad of that Go on my friend go on don't be tedious  Breeze  Yesterday morning we fell in with this here Indiaman now coming into the harbour which Captain Wilmot and every hand aboard says is worth half a million  Ten  It she's worth half that Breeze she's a noble prize Now my old boy what do you say Sure you are not dissatisfied though you have got but the one Indiaman  Deben  But how did the other three escape Breeze Did'nt you meet eyer a galleon in your way  Breeze  Why you know master we have no right  to meddle with a galleon the Spaniards and we are very good friends  Deben  I had forgot thatbut I wish you had snapped her up for all that  Ten  What not content yet Damme you're a true Nabob all the riches of the east would not satisfy you  Breeze  But I have a another message for you Sir There are some great folks taken aboard the Frenchman which Captain Wilmot desires you'll provide lodgings for  Deben  They shall lodge at my own house till they are better provided for But tell me their names and quality that I may know how to conduct myself and make suitable preparations  Breeze  Why in the first place there's a Dutch merchant who has sent a power of money over to Europe he must have a good birth for Captain Wilmot is very fond of him I suppose because he speaks English  Deben  I'll take care of him he shall have the best bed in my house  Breeze  Then there's a French general and his copper coloured wife  Deben  Oh zounds I'll get them private lodgings Any more  Breeze  These are all he spoke to me about  Deben  Pray what is the Dutch merchant and the French general's names  Breeze  The Dutch merchan's name I have forgot but the French general's name is Moonsheer Coromandel  Deben  Upon my word it has a fine rumbling generallike found But harkee Breeze go you in and get some refreshment Here Jonathan  Enter  Jonathan  Here take this honest fellow give him whatever he pleases to eat and drink  Breeze  I shall drink the Charming Sally and her prize in a bumper  Ten  In a dozen Breeze ay you dog till your understanding strikes to the brandy bottle  Exit  Breeze  Deben  Now suppose you were to step into Harriet's apartment and under pretence of shewing your gallantry watch that she receives or sends no letters from or to that dog Belford  Ten  With all my heart I'll e'en finish my pipe with her  Deben  Zounds man don't take your pipe with you women hate the smell of tobacco worse than a waterside warehouse  Ten  I want to ask Breeze some questions and then I'll go court a bit  Deben  Do so do so  Exeunt severally  SCENE III Harriet's  Apartment  Harriet  in a Naval Officer's uniform and  George Belford  discovered  Har  Well George how do I look Very fierce and sailorlike  G Bel  You look bewitchingly terrible as formidable as beauty and a cockade can make you  Har  Psha I don't like that if I were a man I  could say fifty times a handsomer thing to my mistress But can you say nothing to me now upon the figure I cut Is there nothing strikes you ha in this martial air this quarterdeck strut or the easy dangle of this wellhung sword Oh heavens if I were a man and had my mistress in the same situation you now have I'd have something to say to every part about her even her cockade should not escape me I'd tell her that engineer Cupid had lain perdu in that little ambush of black ribband in order to level the artillery of her eyes with more certain aim against her sighing admirer  Enter  Fanny  Fan  Oh dear ma'am I have bad news and good news to tell you all in a breath  G Bel  Then let us have the good news first dear Fanny to give us spirits to support the bad which is to follow  Fan  My sweet Captain Wilmot is coming into the harbour with Lord knows how many French prizes and Spanish rigadoons and all the world is running to see him  G Bel  But are you sure that this is true  Fan  Lord bless me Sir there's Mr Breeze one of his own sailors below with Captain Teneriffe in the back parlour it is from him I learn'd it  G Bel  This is news indeed my Harriet You know Wilmot's friendship for me I could depend upon his assistance to the utmost  Fan  Yes Sir and they took an old Dutch gentleman who knows your father Sir and says that he's  hearty and well somewhere over the sea and as rich as a Jew  G Bel  Gracious heaven What do I hear My father still living after an absence of eighteen years from his friends and his country  Fan  I haven't time now to tell you any more for as I am a living Christian I hear Captain Teneriffe's foot on the stairs What shall we do  G Bel  Can't we get in here till he's gone  Fan  That won't signify Sir a pin for he's coming to see Miss Harriet and he must see her and he will see her Oh I have it Get you in  Pushing  Belford  into the closet  G Bel  Zounds sure you won't leave Harriet out won't he know her  Fan  Get in I tell you he won't know her She looks more like an officer than you do  She shuts him in the closet  Now Madam you are my sweetheart that's enough  Enter Captain  Teneriffe  Ten  Ha who have we here By his uniform he should belong to the navy Damme sure he has not had a signal to come into my little frigate's wake  Fan  Ah Sir how you fine gentlemen do talk and promise us poor girls who have nothing but our  vartues  and out characters to depend upon  Ten  Then you are damn'd badly off let me tell you young woman  Har  Why huffy I'll take you into keeping buy you a gold watch and more silk gowns than you'll be able to wear out these seven years  Ten  What a confounded extravagant young dog it is  Fan  But how shall I be able to reconcile such a thing to my conscience  Ten  Her conscience I see how the land bears Her conscience will be sent on the same cruise with her  vartue  presently  Fan  I think I hear my mistress if we should disturb her we should be undone I'll see if she's stirring    She goes to the closet door seeing  Teneriffe  shrieks and discovers great surprize    Oh heavens we are ruined for ever my character's gone  Har  Drawing  Let me see who dares say a word against your character I'll be thro' his body in a single lunge  Lunges  damme  Ten  Why I won't tell you fool  Har  'Sblood and fire Sir If I thought you would ever breathe an accent which might cast a shadow of reproach on this adorable and virtuous creature's character by the love and tenderness I bear her I'd sacrifice you this moment to my resentment  Ten  Throwing his pipe down with great violence  Why unbend my topsails what do you mean you young lubber to jaw me at this rate Do you think I am afraid of your spit Damme but if you heave out any more of this slack jaw yon wheyfaced milksop I'll shatter your gingerbread upperworks for you and teach you better manners  Fan    Aside to  Harriet  For heaven's sake Madam don't be too bold if he was to get your sword what would become of us  Har  Aside  I had best make it up with himBless me Captain what has put you in this rage I never suspected that you would discover us No Sir I knew Captain Teneriffe to be a man of too much gallantry himself to blab on these delicate occasions  Ten  I don't rightly for my part understand you  young fellow but I'd advise yon to keep a civil tongue in your head if you have a mind to sleep in a whole jacket But now I look at you again though wellrigg'd you are devilish slightly built those timbers don't seem fit for rough weather Damme if I believe you ever had your bows scrap'd yet  Takes her by the chin  Your chin is as bare as a biscuit  Fan  I am frightened out of my wits for fear he should know her  Har  But pr'y thee my old friend ar'n't you going to be married  Ten  Yes my young friend I have some notion of being spliced  Har  A little this way that the girl might not over hear as  Taking  Ten  aside  Fan  I wonder what she is going to say to him  Har  Do you see that door yonder  Pointing to it  Ten  Ay  Har  It's the door of your mistress's bedchamber  Ten  I believe it may  Har  I lay there last night  Ten  The devil you did  Har  I did by all that's false in woman  Ten  And did the stow in the same hammock  Har  I don't know whether I make myself understood but to speak as plain as man can I tell you for all together that she and I lay in the same room and in the same bed last night to which room and which bed I have free access whenever I please to visit them  Ten  Why choke my chain pumps what a discovery is here  Har  But I must insist upon your secrecy my honour is at stake I confess I conceived a friendship for you the moment I saw you and determined to tell you the secret to prevent your being imposed upon  Ten  Give me your hand I take you to be a damn'd honest little fellow but to shew you that I am none of your falsehearted ungrateful lubbers as I have pretry good interest with a certain great man I'll endeavour to get you a ship you dog  Har  That will make me happy indeed  Deben  Without  Stow all the general's chests and trunks below stairs  Fan  Oh Lord we are undone Here comes my master  Ten  Here comes Debenture Now you shall see how I'll accost him  Har  But my dear friend I shall be ruined if he finds me here Suppose you were to tell him I am a relation of yours invited here to see your wedding  Ten  But do you think he'll believe me  Har  Never doubt it  Ten  Do you take a turn or two to leeward and I'll try if I can't get to windward of him  Enter  Debenture  Deben  They can't come up to the quay for want of water this half hour but General Coromandel and the swarthy lady and Mynheer Van Slopen are all coming ashore in the barge Ha who the dickens have we yonder What brings him here Do you know him friend Teneriffe  Seeing  Harriet  Ten  Very well he's my kinsman  Deben  Oh is he Sir your most humble servant    Salutes  Harriet  You are welcome to Liverpool It is really a pretty young fellow I suppose he's come to be present at your wedding  She bows  Ten  He is but he'll be disappointed  Deben  Why has Harriet told you she won't have you  Ten  No But I tell you but I won't have her  Deben  Ha what's this I hear Won't have her  Ten  No I tell you I am an old seaman and have no mind for a voyage round cape Horn  Deben  But what is the meaning of all this Where is Harriet  Ten  I tell you what I won't have your daughter and I tell you why I don't love to have the cargo of a vessel charged to my account when I have no hand in the freighting her  Deben  I don't know what you mean what have you to say against my daughter  Ten  Ask my kinsman he'll tell you  Deben  What that jackanapes strutting about there Is it he has made all this mischief  Ten  He knows your daughter  Deben  Well and what thenDo you know my daughter Sir  Har  I have that honour Sir  Bowing  Oh Fanny I wish I was out of the house  Aside to  Fanny  Fan  I wish to the Lord you were Ma'am  Deben  And pray Sir how long have you known herHarriet herself as I'm alive  Har  As long as I can remember Sir I know all and every thing about her  Ten  What do you say to thisBut he'll tell you more presently  Deben  Most noble Sir your very humble servant Pray Sir what is your rank in the navy Admiral I suppose Why friend Teneriffe I find your kinsman is a near relation of mine  Ten  EhWhy sure it can't beYes but it is  Deben  Oh thou wise head to be so grossly imposed upon Now Sir as I have a great regard for my daughter's character and as I understand you have  been taking great liberties with it I'll take care to confine you till I have secured her a husband  Attempts to open the closet door which he finds locked  Here you baggage give me the key of this door  To  Fanny  Fan  I have it not Sir  Deben  Who has it then  Fan  I don't know its lost Sir my mistress does not lie there now  Deben  You lie huffy in every part of the house and therefore should give an account of every thing missing Give it me this moment or I'll turn you out of doors  Fan  With all my heart    Aside to  Harriet  It is locked on the inside Ma'am don't mind him  Har  I am terrified to death for fear they should attempt to break it open  Deben  Here Robin William Jonathan Come up all of you here and break open this door for me there's more yet in the wind this door has not been locked for nothing  Enter Servants with slaves and crows c  Break it open I say    As they are about to open it  George Belford  appears    Deben  What George  G Bel  Spare your severity Sir for a moment Captain Teneriffe a word with you  Ten  A word a whole log book if you please  They retire apart and seem in warm debate  Deben  EhWhat the devil can he want with him  Har  Support me Fanny or I shall faint Will you give me leave to retire  To  Debenture  Deben  Ay ay you shall retire Come alongWhat huffy do you think to go in with her  Fan  Lud don't you see the poor young lady is scarce able to stand upon her legs  Deben  Then I am sure you are a damned bad prop to save any woman from falling But get along in for this time and I'll take care you shall pack off bag and baggage as soon as she is recovered a little  Har  Oh fortune this is one of thy severest strokes  Exeunt  Harriet  and  Fanny  into the bedchamber  Deben  After locking them in  So the bird is caged again  Ten  Damme I am too old and weatherbeaten to fight now  G Bel  As a man of honour you can never be too old to fight though as a man of sense you have been long too old to marry But Sir I have done you know my fixed my determined resolution and as you value your reputation direct your conduct  Exit  George Belford  Deben  What does he want you to fight him Has he challenged you  Ten  Yes he has challenged me  Deben  But sure you are not fool enough to mind that  Ten  Why lookee friend I am not afraid do you see of any man or any ship that sails the salt seas but I don't think it right to venture my life for a woman besides if it is to be lost my king and country have the best right to the first offer of it  Deben  Make yourself easy for I'll go immediately and have you both bound over Come along the barge

acquaintance  Wilm  Sir this is the general's lady  Adel  Me be very glad to see you vit all my heart  Wilm  And this Sir is Mynheer Van Slopen  Deben  Sir you are welcome to England I am proud to hear you have sent your money home before to Holland  O Bel  Sir I thank you my property has fortunately arrived long since in Europe  Deben  Why Sir you speak EnglishWe were told you were a Dutchman  O Bel  Sir I received the early and greater part of my education in England  Aside  He has no recollection of me I perceive  Deben  Sir I'll endeavour to make your stay in England as agreeable as possible We English love the Dutch and I hope shall continue always on good terms And now Madam and you gentlemen will you give me leave to shew you your apartments poor accommodation but the best I have Friend Teneriffe you'll have the goodness to take care of Mr Slopen  Exeunt all but  Belford  and  Wilmot  Ten  Come Sir we are under sailing orders  O Bel  I have a few words to say to Captain Wilmot and shall follow you  Ten  Well I shall make sail ahead but don't let that separate you from the body of the fleet  Exit  O Bel  You have written to young Belford  Wilm  I have Sir and expect him here every moment  O Belf  I esteemed his father and promised him when I was quitting India upon my arrival in Europe to make enquiries into the state of his family  Wilm  It is somewhat extraordinary Sir that he never wrote to his son  O Bel  He heard that he died soon after his mother I myself have paid a tear more than once to their memory when my friend in the anguish of recollection has related the misfortunes of his youth to me  Wilm  Here is Mr Belford's servant  Enter  Bronze  Bron  Sir you are welcome homeI wish you joy  with all my heart I hope to see you a Nabob before you have done with the Mounsieurs  Wilm  Thank you thank you Bronze But where's your master  Bron  What has not he been here  Wilm  No  Bron  Ay Sir at his old tricks some game has started and as he knows you Captain to be a keen sportsman he thinks he may break an appointment with you on certain occasions 'Sdeath Sir don't you know him of old no magnet ever misled steel as a petticoat will my masterBut lord Sir what need I say any thing to you who from your own expeperience must have such a fellow feeling for him  O Belf  I am sorry Captain Wilmot to hear this man speak thus of my friend's son you taught me to believe that he was prudent and sober free from the vices which in general taint youth  Bron  Prudent and sober and so he is Sir as prudent and sober as any young gentleman in England but you judge of him Mynheer by the standard of Dutch constitution in which all the philosophers agree that the blood freezes before twenty  O Bel  Aside  I am determined to know more of my son's character before I discover myselfIs there no possibility friend of seeing your master  Bron  Not I fancy till he has dispatched his present business though you were a prime minister  O Bel  I fear Captain Wilmot I shall have but an unfavourable account to transmit to India of young Belford  Bron    Aside to  Wilmot  'Sdeath Sir sure this is not the old gentleman who knows my master's father in India  Wilm  Yes but it is Bronze and you should have spoke with less levity of himBut I hope Sir you  will take my word before this fellow's for my friend's character  To  Old Belford  Bron  Do I beseech you Sir for I have got such a damn'd habit of lying and slandering by living in great families that I can't give a good character of anybodySober and prudent did I say my master's as regular as a timepiece never out of order unless when he threshes me his pulse does not quicken two strokes in a month his blood is all iced cream nothing warm about him except his heart and that Sir I assure you is every fibre English  Wilm  But yonder comes George let him speak for himself  O Bel  What is that he  Wilm  You seem moved Sir  O Bel  Aside  His mother's dear image at once softens and reproaches me in his looksI confess I am moved Sir His father I have the strongest friendship for and he resembles him much  Enter  George Belford  G Bel  Dear Wilmot I am rejoiced to see you  Wilm  I think George you'll believe me When I say the pleasure is mutual but my boy I can serve you with old Hunks I have two powerful advocates to back my petition in your behalf gold and success George which never plead in vain with your uncle  OBel  Aside  Nature is at this moment so powerful with my spirit my greatest efforts can scarce hide the tumult  Wilm  But give me leave George to introduce you to this gentleman Mynheer Van Slopen he knows your father and assures me he is still living  G Bel  With esteem and respect I meet a gentleman who is my father's friend  O Bel  I have lived Sir in the strictest intimacy with your father for many years and slender as my knowledge of his son is I feel I must regard him  G Bel  I hope Sir fortune has not been unkind to him  O Bel  Liberal to a degree his fortune is immense  Bron  Ecod that's good hearing we shall touch soon I perceive    Aside to  G Belford  Pray Sir if I may be so bold as to ask when do you think the old gentleman will return to Europe  O Bel  I can't tell you friend however this much I can tell you that you have no reason to desire his arrival for whenever he comes he'll make your master part with you  Bron  Lord Sir what unforgiving tempers you Dutch gentlemen have Why Sir nobody minds what I say I am so poor Sir that they call me a wit and by that charter I speak ill of every body  Wilm  I shall go this moment George to my uncle's and if I find argument to be lost on him will assist you in getting Harriet away thanks to fortune my friend I am rich enough to make us both happy  O Bel  I think Sir I could powerfully assist your cause by letting him know your father's riches  Bron  You are right indeed Sir tell him my master's father is rich and he'll prefer him to the wisest soninlaw in England  Wilm  I'll meet you within an hour on board the prize  G Bel  Till then adieu in the mean time I shall beg to know of this gentleman more of my father's fate  Exeunt  Old Belford G Belford  and  Wilmot  Bron  So I am to be turned off as soon as the old gentleman returns A pretty requital truly for toiling and hurrying so long with the young oneDamme if such ingratitude is n't enough to put a man out of conceit with the world and make him retire like Diogenes to a tub or rather a caska  full  one though for I'll be hanged Bronze if thou couldst ever play Diogenes from an empty one Well then to a full cask will I retire and since I can't rail the world into gratitude like a wiser philosopher than Diogenes was I'll drink myself into patience  Exit  SCENE  changes to an Apartment

like him for he's worth above a hundred thousand poundsHa Egad I believe Monsieur is coming to ask my conset already Get you to your chamber and prepare yourself to receive Captain Teneriffe Come

the diamonds and conceal this from my partners  Corom  Je les apporterai tout maintenantI vil bring dem dis instantprovided you keep a your vord  Deben  Keep yours and never fear me Oh I find Monsieur Coromandel is a very honest fellow    Exit  Coromandel  Oh here is Mynheer Van Slopen I am' wonderfully taken with this Dutch merchant I understand he has lodged upwards of in the Dutch funds What a fine understanding he must possess to have made such a fortune  Enter  Old Belford  Dear Sir you are kindly welcome to my house I beg you'll consider it your home you shall have as hearty a welcome as you'd meet with in Holland  O Bel  Sir you oppress me with civilities I fear it will exceed my power to make you any thing like a suitable return  Deben  If you say a word more of a return it will make me angry with youwhen I hear you talk so it makes me think you suppose me avariciousbut my good Sir how can I serve you Do you want money I know you have enough of it or I would not ask you the question for fear of offending you  O Bel  Sir I heartily thank you for your obliging offer but I am amply supply'd for my present occasion  Deben  But Mynheer where is Captain Wilmot Hadn't he the good manners to shew you to my house  O Bel  I left him this moment talking to Adelaide Monsieur Coromandel's Gentoo wife She was in tears and I overheard her say she had a secret to communicate to him  Deben  Aside  The murder's out then I find she has heard of the General's intended marriage with Harriet But do you think Mynheer that this brown woman is really the General's wife  O Bel  It was so said in India and that she had brought him an immense fortune in jewels  Deben  Aside  O ho these are part of her fortune I am going to get  O Bel  Looking out as into another room  Pray Sir who is that young lady I see yonder  Deben  What that's leaning upon her elbow with the book in her hand That Sir is my daughter  O Bel  She's exceedingly handsome  Deben  O Sir you see her at a distancewell enough to pass  O Bel  I never beheld any thing so bewitchingly handsome  Deben  Aside  Why sure Mynheer has'nt fall'n in love with her I wish he would he'd make a better soninlaw than either of 'em then the Frenchman will be glad to give me one of the diamonds to keep me silent which is my interest as one is more than would fall to my share should I discover  O Bel  There is something in that young lady I am particularly taken with  Deben  Why Sir I'll call her in and introduce you to her  Going  O Bel  By no means she appears intent upon some favourite author and I would not disturb her for the world  Deben  Favourite fiddlestickI'll call her  Going again  O Ben  I beg my good friend you'd sit down I have something to say to you  Deben  Ay ay I see she has done Mynheer's business Give me leave Mynheer  Hands chairs and they sit  O Bel  I have a great notion of settling in England Mr Debenture  Deben  And I advise you to it by all means our climate is a great deal better than yours we have scare half a dozen fogs in the year and even these we import by an easterly wind from Holland but I'd advise you to marry A young wife would prolong your life twenty years  O Bel  I confess to you Sir I have no objection to the married state provided I could meet with a partner suitable to my fancy  Deben  Will you take one of my recommending  O Bel  With all my heart  Deben  What do you say to that girl yonder  O Bel  That I am ready to lay my fortune at her feet  Deben  I'll call her in this moment  Going  O Bel  Hold a momentIs not she on the point of marriage with another  Deben  It is no such thingMonsieur Coromandel indeed proposed for her but I have more conscience than to consent to such a union whilst the saffronfaced lady is living  O Bel  But I understood that the young lady's affection were actually engaged to Mr Belford  Deben  What my nephew I'd as soon marry her  to old Midships as to that fellow Why Sir if it was only for his father's sake he should not have her  O Belf  I fancy you forget Mr Debenture that his father was my friend  Deben  I am very sorry you had ever any connection with him I was in hopes he was hanged  O Bel  Aside  He's certainly much obliged to you  Deben  But I'll bring in Harriet and introduce you to her she shall sing you a song and play you a tune upon the harpsichord On she thrums rarely upon the harpsichord  Exit  Debenture  O Bel  If I had unmasked and avowed myself at once an advocate for my son I find I should not have succeeded I'll discover myself to Harriet and make no doubt but her father will overlook all objections when he finds that I really possess Mynheer Van Slopen's property  Enter  Debenture  and  Harriet  Deben  Oh you obstinate baggage are you determined to put your kind indulgent father in the grave One who never crosses you in any thing you ungrateful slut you  Har  I beseech you Sir on my knees not to press me farther  Kneels  Deben  Mynheer I'll be with you presently I am only giving Harriet a blessing before I introduce her 'Sdeath Madam what do you mean  Har  Well Sir since you are determined upon making me wretched I resign myself as I have been taught to think it is my duty to do so  Deben  What a sweet dutiful good girl it is Here Mynheer is a pattern for daughters but I'll leave you together Harkee Mynheer    Aside  to Old Belford  Pres the marriage she'll excuse your impatience  as you are just arrived from the EastIndies  Exit  Debenture  O Bel  I am sorry Madam my presence distresses you so much  Har  Oh Sir I understand that you know Mr Belford's father that you had a friendship for him how then can you be the instrument of making your friend's son miserable  O Bel  What Madam are you so strongly attached to this young Belford  Har  Attached Sir his happiness and mine are inseparably united I live only in the expectation of being his  O Bel  Then Madam I can hardly suppose he deserves a bad character  Har  A bad character The breath of malice could never glance upon his reputation The amiableness of his manner the sweetness of his temper have gained him the affection of every body except my unrelenting father  O Bel  I must believe you for your words give me rapture  Har  Why can you receive pleasure from the praises of a rival  O Bel  A rival he's my son and can you wonder at my transports  Har  Am I awake  O Bel  My dear girl conceal your emotion as much as possible and appear resigned to comply with your father's request I have not yet discovered myself to George but promised to intercede for him I'll put him a little to the rack to render his pleasure afterwards the more exquisite  Deben  Without  You shall not go in Wilmot Mynheer Van Slopen is very busy he can't speak to you  Wilmot  Without  But I will I am determined to know the bottom of all this  Enter  Debenture Wilmot  and  Adelaide  O Bel  What can be the meaning of this confusion  Wilm  Mynheer Van Slopen do you not know that Adelaide is the legal wife of Coromandel  O Bel  I heard as much in IndiaI can even go so far at to declare she was publicly received as his wife  Adel  Me vas indeed My father gave him two grands diamants for my fortune  Wilm  Two great diamonds for your fortune and what's become of them  Adel  He has dem here  Points to her breast  in his best of coat  Deben  Pho pho pho Do you mind what she says after the falshood she has told you He got diamonds concealed not he poor fellow I look upon the General to be a very honest man one that would not wrong us of a sixpence  Aside  It would be the very devil if the diamonds should be discovered  Wilm  As for your part Mr Debenture I am astonished at you how could you think of giving your daughter to a man who has a wife already  Deben  Why now here it is Why that circumstance alone might convince you Did not I tell you before that this was all an invention of this woman's the mere effect of jealousy I suppose just of a piece with the tale of the diamondsBut ask Mynheer he can acquit me of this charge  O Bel  I think Captain Wilmot I can assure you that Mr Debenture has other views for his daughter  Deben  Ay other views for my daughter Zounds do you think I'd give her to a coppercoloured rascal  upon half an hour's acquaintanceA fellow sprung from the lord knows who and come from the lord knows where  Wilm  Truly this is most extraordinary  Deben  I never met with any thing so extraordinary in the course of my life But harkee Wilmot is she accustomed to drink she does not appear to me to be perfectly sober  Aside to him  Wilm  Where is the General Adelaide  Adel  At de ship to get de diamant  Wilm  Then Mr Debenture will you accompany me so far Your interest as well at mine is concerned  Deben  My dear friend sure I know thatI know what I have to lose if the diamonds be discovered  Aside  Wilm  You'll come Mynheer  O Bel  With all my heart I should be glad to know the truth  Exeunt  Wilmot  and  O Belf  Deben  But Harriet how do you like him  Har  Sir you have made me happy by introducing me to him  Deben  My dear girl you transport meBut its no wonder she likes himHe's a fine looking old fellowDamme I shall ever think well of a Dutchman's gallantry  Exeunt  SCENE  changes to a view of the harbour the  French EastIndiaman  and the Privateer riding at anchor  Enter  Teneriffe  and  Geo Belford  Ten  We'll crui  e in company my boy and whoever she strikes to first he shall have her  Geo Bel  Then from this moment all animosity ceases between us as rivals  Enter  Bronze  Bron  Sir I have the strangest news for youthere's a treaty of alliance going to be struck between France and England  Ten  Damme impossible you may as well tell me of a treaty of alliance between salt water and fresh but this is news brought by the Brussels Gazette packet which ought to be sunk long ago for it's damn'd cargo of lying intelligence  G Bel  Explain Bronze I don't understand you  Bron  Then Sir to descend to the humble phrase of comprehension I have the infelicity to inform you Sir and you too Captain that Miss Harriet Debenture is going to be married to General Coromandel  G Bel  What the French General taken in the prize  Bron  The same Sir  Ten  He's Wilmot's prisoner we'll clap him in irons if he does not resign her  G Bel  Where is he Bronze  Bron  I am told that he and his valet are on board the prize concealing no doubt what they can as this I understand is to be their last visit to it Stand back here he comes let me have the rumaging of him  Coromandel  comes ashore with his valet in the boat  Ten  Avast I won't have his lockers meddled with though he fights under an enemy's flag he's an officer and a gentleman and shall be treated with honour and respect  Wilm  Without  Let General Coromandel and his valet be secured  Bron    To G Belford  S'death Sir here comes your uncle step into that coffeehouse and if any thing happen which should require your presence I'll be with you in a trice Away they are here  Exit  G Belford  Enter  Debenture Wilmot Old Belford Harriet  and  Adelaide  Corom  Secure me and my valetpourquoy For vat mon Dieu  To Debent  Ah mon

your charge  Adel  He has dem here  Pointing to his left breast  Corom  Diable que faites vousvat you do damn'd vomans  Wilm  Come come Monsieur no resistance  Cuts from the inside of his coat a case with diamonds  Ten  Damme he has 'em sure enough who could have suppos'd this now General henceforth I'll never trust to the honour of a  French  one  Deben  Well I protest I could never have suspected this Why now General do you think this it behaving like a gentleman to conceal these diamonds after our civil treatment of you  Corom  Eh bien MonsieurDid a you not know it yourself  Deben  I know it who the devil should tell me Here's a fellow for you Damme he wants to make me an accomplice in his villainy  Corom  Mais Monsieur Debenture avez vons oublie votre promesse You no remember your promise  Deben  Upon my word my good friend I am quite in the darkI don't recollect any promise I ever made you  Corom  Non did you no say you would marry me your daughter pour ceux diamants  Deben  Who I Do you think I have taken leave of my senses Besides ar'nt you married alreadydo you think you are in Turkey where you may have as many wives as you please But I see how it isall this mistake I perceive is owing to my not understanding French  Ten  Now I perceive the reason I was turn'd adrift he had a better prize in view  O Bel  Oh fie fie fie Coromandel this gentleman so far from intending his daughter to you has already disposed of her to me  Ten  Damme sure you don't say so  Bron  Aside  There's some soul play going forward I'll call my master  Exit  Bronze  Wilm  But is this fair Is this honourable Mynheer Did you not promise my friend to exert your interest in his behalf  Ten  This fellow's a true Dutchman shews fair colours to all nations but under deck fomenting their quarrels so by his neutral flag he's always sure of bringing his cargo to the best market  Enter  G Belford  and  Bronze  G Bel  Where is the man who under the specious title of my father's friend has aim'd such a blow at  my happiness Have you acted well Sir it this your promise to serve me  O Bel  Will you be calm for a moment Sir  G Bel  Is this Sir your friendship for my father basely to take advantage of the influence your immoderate wealth gave you to render his son the most miserable of mankind But what are my sufferings I feel most for my poor Harriet who is thus sacrificed  O Bel  Hold hold Sir I fancy you mistake perhaps you will find this young lady not altogether so averse to this match as you may imagine undeceive him my dear Harriet and let him know your regard for me  G Bel  Her regard for you  Har  Yes George it is very truemy regard for himdon't blame me now for I protest I can't help it  G Bel  I am in a dream surely  Bronze  Who the devil would

woman  Going  O Bel  His agitation touches me to the soul Mr Belford a word with you  G Bel  With me Sir  O Bel  Sir to shew you that I don't want generosity I'll resign you your mistress  Deben  What without my consent Mynheer Do you think I'll give my daughter to a beggar  O Bel  A beggar Sir I'll settle half my fortune upon him immediately and the remainder at my death  Deben  I don't believe a word of it  G Bel  In the name of all that's noble and generous  who are you that rack me thus alternately with hope and despair  O Bel  Who am I Look in my face George and tell me if you read nothing there warmer than benevolence or friendship Do you not read in these tears in this wild this ungovernable tumult of spirit the fond affection of a parent  G Bel  It is it is my father Nature tells me so  They embrace  O Bel  Rise George now I am truly happy  Deben  Aside  His father I am in a fine scrape then but it is no matter I must brazen it outMy dear brother you are welcome to Europe how rejoiced I am to find you returned so well  Aside  And with so much money    To  G Belford  Why Belford you young dog I was all along determined nobody but you should have my daughter there heaven bless you together and now let us see who dare separate you  Wilm  My dear George I want words to express the pleasure I feel    To  O Belford  But why dear Sir would you conceal yourself from me  O Bel  You know Wilmot I was a stranger to your character I had determined to conceal myself from every body in order to come with more ease and certainty at a knowledge of my son's disposition and had he not proved what I wished and what I find him I would have buried myself in some obscure retreat and conceal'd my chagrin and disappointment for ever  Ten  Mr Belford give me your hand you are welcome to England I had forgot your face but you know we were once messmates we have peppered the Monsieurs before now in company    To  G Bel  And young fellow I wish you joy with all my heart I now begin to think it better for all parties that you have got the girl As for you Mr Debenture  Deben  Ay here it is now we shall never hear the last of this story of the diamonds  Ten  I tell you what
