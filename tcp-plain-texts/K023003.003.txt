 Mr POPE's Literary Correspondence  VOLUME the THIRD  With LETTERS  To  and  From  The Duke of SHREWSBERRY  Lord LANSDOWNE  Bishop of ST ASAPH  Sir BERKELEY LUCY  WILLIAM WALSH  Esq  Lady CHUDLEIGH  Mrs MANLEY  Mrs THOMAS  c  LONDON  Printed for E CURLL at  Pope  's  Head  in  RoseStreet CoventGarden  MDCCXXXV  To the SUBSCRIBERS  GENTLEMEN  _MR  Pope  's Project to usher his Letters into the World by my Means was the Foundation of this Scheme of  A Literary Correspondence  which has been so well received that it shall be continued while People of Taste approve of it And that will be as long as People of Taste who have valuable Performances in this Kind in their Power contribute their Stores to the Emolument of Mankind Not but that I am always ready and willing to purchase any Genuine Pieces from such Possessors as expect a  Premium  The second Volume of this Work promised besides Mr  Pope  's to contain Letters to and from Lord  Somers  c notwithstanding which Mr  Pope  in his Spleen has employed his Sifters to talk his Sense of the Matter to me particularly 'Squire  Brocade  whose Objections intermixed with my Answers make a very notable Scene to the following Effect  viz  Enter BROCADE Sept  Mr  Curll  how comes it that you call this Second Volume  Mr  Pope's  Correspondence  when there is so much more of other Peoples This is a mere Imposition upon the Town  C  Sir be pleased to read the TitlePage I began this Collection chiefly upon what remain'd of Mr  Pope  's and besides finding most of my Customers eager to see the Minds of Men especially in the Case of  Epistolary Writing  and having considerable Supplies of the Kind I published a  Second Volume  as you see and have Materials of equal Value and sufficient in Quantity to make a  Third  and  Fourth  B  Dn me I do not desire to read any Man's Writings but  Pope  's he's the only Writer of the Age his Equal never lived in any Time or Country There's nothing worth reading in either of your Volumes but what is his  C  Sir It is not my Business to set up my Opinion against that of Gentlemen who do me the Favour to call at my Shop but some of my Customers whose Judgment is much esteemed among their Acquaintance  have said that Mr  Pope  's Share in this Second Volume is the very worst Part of the Book  B  Z  s what do you mean by that Will you pretend to name any Writer in Competition with Mr  Pope  C  Sir they do pretend to say that the Pieces of Bishop ATTERBURY in this Volume are something beyond Mr  Pope  's Compass His Style in  Prose  his Judgment in the CriticalTaste his Heroic Love of his Country his Vindication of Lord  Clarendon  's History from an unattested Calumny and his ABSALON ACHITOPHEL tho' done when he was a Youth at the University are all inimitable by Mr  Pope  B  Your Judges are Blockheads there's not a polite Man about the Town reads any Thing but what is  Pope  's How impertinent is it to publish that  Absalon Achitophel  in  Latin  without getting it translated for the Ladies if it be good for any Thing What a Pox do you think Gentlemen must be at the Slavery like Schoolboys of construing it to them in  English  It would be well for you if you could pacify Mr  Pope  perhaps if he and you were Friends he might be prevailed on to take a hundred Guineas to do it for you  C  Sir I presume you have seen the Poem in its  English  Original by Mr  Dryden  I doubt whether the Public would desire Mr  Pope  's finishing Hand to that Piece  B  Dryden  was a tolerable Poet in his Time but nothing in Comparison to  Pope  There's  Le Neve  's  Will and Creed  I like well enough because they contain partly my own Religion But there's his Epitaph in  Latin  why is not that translated  C  Because Sir it contains some Particulars that cannot be so well expressed in any other Language  B  Sir I think as I please but what do you mean by those Political Letters of  Addison Prior Harley  and the rest there is not any  Wit  in them surely  C  I grant it Sir because the Writers of them did not intend it But I am told there is much  Good Sense  in them that they open the Scene of the famous  Partition Treaty  and the Designs of  France  upon the Death of King CHARLES II of  Spain  that they discover the Importance of a Man who is trusted with Affairs and how mere  un homme sans consequence  a Man may be with a great Employment if the Conduct of the secret Springs of Action is placed in other Hands With many other useful Lessons  B  Why Mr  Curll  you are a great Politician  C  Very little of a Politician truly Sir But since there are some Gentlemen inclined to adore a single Name among the polite Writers to the Prejudice of all the rest and to point me out as Heretical for being of a different Opinion it is necessary I should be able to give some Reason for my Dissent and that I apprehend is done to the Purpose if I am able to shew the Excellency the Superiority of many others over Mr  Pope  in this Epistolary Taste especially  B  Pray Mr  Curll  have you sorted your Materials for your  Third Volume  C  Yes Sir  B  Do you make it a Secret or may we be informed what the principal Parts are to be  C  Sir I'll inform you with Pleasure it is no Secret at all I assure you There are more of Mr  Pope  's Letters to Ladies particularly her Grace the Duchess of  Buckinghamshire  Some very pretty Letters of Mrs  Manley  full of true Humour perfectly picturesque in a genteel unaffected Style natively pleasant and as  Horace  says  simplex munditiis  There are excellent ones of the late Lord  Lansdowne  They convince the Reader of  the Patriot the  Englishman  the Christian the Tenderness of the most humane Mind the Politeness of the finest Gentleman the Dignity of the  British  Peer are here united and shine forth with full Lustre in the utmost Propriety and Perspicuity of Language  B  You flourish abundantly  Curll  why  Lansaowne  was a  Jacobite  C  Now Sir you are quite out read his Lordship's Character of Queen CAROLINE My Lord was indeed very young when he wrote some of these Letters and the Prince of  Orange  was not then landed But I presume had it been so a  Jacobite  might possibly be a Man of Wit for Mr  Pope  is allowed to be so tho' he owns himself a Papist But here are Letters of my Lord's that shew other Sort of Sentiments at a riper Age with Regard to the Revolution Settlement  B  Well are there any other Writers in your Third Volume  C  Yes yes Sir we are only got forward Pages and then we present you an invaluable Tract of Mr  Walsh  's Be pleased Sir to read Mr  Dryden  's Opinion of him and of this Piece  B  Sir I pay no Regard to Mr  Dryden  's Flattery  C  Wycherley  and  Pope  for That But hear Sir how Mr  Pope  sings  To  Walsh  the Wit of  Greece  and  Rome  was known  And ev'ry Author's Merit but his own  And in his Epistle to  Arbuthnot  he prides himself that  The knowing  Walsh  wou'd tell him he cou'd write  B  Well I see it appears by Mr  Pope  that Mr  Walsh  was a very great Man Are we to have any Thing more  C  Yes Sir The  Hospital of Fools  is an Imitation of  Lucian  by Mr  Walsh  and Gentlemen of the best Taste among my Customers agree that  Lucian  wrote nothing equal to it I had forgot to mention a Letter concerning Asses containing abundance of Wit The rest of the Book will consist of Dr  Atterbury  's Pieces translated Letters of Lady  Chudleigh  Mrs  Thomas  and others of great Character for Wit or Literature or both And there will be some curious Anecdotes concerning that indefatigable Antiquary the late Mr  Thomas Hearne  of  Oxford  and his Writings And relating to that most exemplary as well as most noble Princess the late Duchess of  Ormonde  with a fine Copy of Verses in her Praise by a greater Man than Mr  Pope  B  Ay who is that pray  C  One  John Dryden  Sir  B  Curll  you are really impertinent  C  Sir you are really conceited and I would advise you to enter yourself of  Tim Lancet  's Society and read the  Dunciad  on  Sundays  as he says he constantly does I cannot lose any more Time Sir in such trifling Debates you are resolved not to like any Writer but Mr  Pope  and I am resolved to carry on this Scheme of a  Literary Correspondence  so long as Works of real Worth are sent me by the polite and judicious Part of Mankind My Respects Sir to Mr  Pope  when you see him  Yours EC  NB  The FOURTH VOLUME of our LITERARY CORRESPONDENCE will open with a Collection of  Historical Letters  beginning and ending wherein the most important Points of the  British  Affairs are discussed By an Old Whig Printed from an Original Manuscript With which I received the following Letter from a very eminent Gentleman of the LongRobe upon his reading the Sheets of this Third Volume as they came from the Press  E CURLL  To Mr CURLL  I Have read the Three Volumes of your  Literary Correspondence  with Satisfaction A Collection of good Letters is much wanted in our Language The  French  have several and I think they outdo us in no other Article of polite Literature Artificial Letters written on Purpose to be published are apt to fall short of the vivid Force and Openness found in the unbosoming of Friend to Friend therefore it is extreamly difficult to imitate well as it also is to obtain the Papers of a valuable real Correspondence  If Gentlemen could be satisfied there would be no Endeavours to know how Letters came to the Press I am persuaded our free learned polite Age and Country might easily find you a genuine Collection in the best Taste  For my own Part I will not have any Doubt of your Conduct in this Respect therefore you now receive inclosed the very Mind of a Man of Sense and Rank in his Country upon public Affairs from the Revolution to the Year Most of them were Letters to the late Bishop  Atterbury  and the rest to an intimate Friend of his who died before him  The Bishop a few Months before his Death lent them to a Nobleman in  France  from whom I had them and at the same Time he told him  they were written by the honestest Whig of his Acquaintance  that he differ'd from the Writer upon several Points but look'd upon him to be a good  Englishman  in the main that he the Bishop had been censur'd by his Enemies as a hot Partyman but that he could always relish the Correspondence of a Person of Sincerity and Honour though of different Sentiments in Politics or Religion and that if he did not live to ask for these Letters again as he found himself in a declining Condition he desired they might not be lost because there was  much Truth and good Sense in them  but insisted  that if they went abroad it would be in such a Manner as not to prejudice the Writer of them in any Branch of his Family which might have Occasion for the Countenance of Men in Power  If you think it agreeable to your Scheme you may publish them if not I wish you Supplies more to your Purpose and am  Sir  Your Humble Servant BT  London  Sept  E CURLL  ad  A POPE  S P D  THAT our Name and Fame may be equally transmitted to Posterity in this our  Literary Correspondence  most earnestly desiring A faithful Register of Matters of Fact will be the best Method for obtaining these desirable Ends  Having given Notice in the  St James's EveningPost  of  Saturday July  th that the SECOND  Volume  of  Literary Correspondence  would be published on  Monday  the th You was pleased in the  London Gazette  of  Tuesday  the th to insert an Advertisement which I shall here paraphrastically reinsert for the true Information of the Public  viz  Whereas several Booksellers  Printers and Publishers  viz L Gilliver T Cooper  and  J Watson    have printed several surreptitious and incorrect Editions of Letters as mine some of which are not so  being written by those Persons to whom they are by  E Curll  justly ascribed  and others interpolated  by the Editor of those six hundred Copies sold  by the Reverend Mr  R Smythe  pursuant to the Direction of his Cousin  PT  both Agents of mine to the aforesaid  E Curll    and whereas there are daily Advertisements of  SECOND  and  THIRD  Volumes of more such Letters particularly my Correspondence with  Dr FRANCIS ATTERBURY  the late Bishop of  Rochester the said SECOND and THIRD Volumes being now published  I think myself under a Necessity to publish such of the said Letters as are genuine  not hitherto published  with the Addition of some others of a Nature less insignificant especially those which passed between the said Bishop  ATTERBURY  and myself or were any way relating to him which shall be printed with all convenient Speed  and which will likewise be faithfully reprinted by  E Curll  as a Supplement to the THREE VOLUMES of  Literary Correspondence  by him published and carried on with the universal Approbation of the Public  A POPE  This Sir must be understood to be the true Meaning of the foregoing Advertisement and which shall be by me  literally  made good  As to  R Smythe  whom you have been pleased to inform me was only  a pretended Clergyman  against therefore this nominal  R Smythe  exclusive of his Function I have exhibited a Bill in  Chancery  to hold him to his Contract of delivering to me six hundred printed Copies of the  First Volume  of your Letters printed by your own Direction to compleat your Correspondence with Mr  Wycherley  as  Lawton Gilliver  hath himself acknowledged whom with yourself I have made Parties to my Bill against  R Smythe  not in the least doubting but from such an equitable  Triumvirate  I shall obtain Justice  For with you Sir  Flatt'ry in ev'ry Shape I hold a Shame  And think a Lye in Verse or Prose the same  Epistle to Dr  Arbuthnot  Bravo to God and Coward unto Man  The Lyar is  Dr  South  's Character of the  Lyar  deny this Truth who can  This  Vice  Sir is as  mean  as it is  base  and as you have found in all Debates between us has been the Abhorrence of  Your Humble Servant E CURLL  PECKHAM  Sept  PS  As I am pretty conversant with those Authors whose Works I print in revising  vising my old Friend VOITURE for a new Edition I find you have very politely pillaged his Letters Your  First  To a  Lady  with a  Book  of  Drawings  is evidently taken from  One  he wrote to  Madame Rambouillet  in the Name of  Callot  the Engraver presenting a Book of his Prints Your  Second  is I find a Compliment to our Friend Parson  Broome  and Mrs  Betty Marriot  of  SturstonHall  in  Suffolk  And  lastly  the Compliments in those Letters of this Volume to Miss  B  are transplanted from what VOITURE wrote to  Madame Rambouillet  M  Vigean  and other Ladies of the Court of  France  ERRATA  LETTER d to Miss  B  Line  for  Liberty  read  Liberality  Belluchi  mention'd in the Letter to the Duchess of  B  was a  Painter  not a  Statuary  TO Mr EDMUND CURLL Bookseller In  RoseStreet CoventGarden  Mr CURLL  _THE Characteristicks whereby the Author of the inclosed Letters may be known are too many and glaring to need any mentioning of his  Name  Were there no other Arguments to confirm this his  own Pen betrays him  But for your farther Satisfaction I must inform you that I found them among some Papers of a deceased Friend with several others  of a Nature more insignificant  which therefore I  would not transcribe The Gentleman's Wife before she was so is known to have been personally acquainted with your Adversary which puts the Matter past Doubt  With many Thanks for your  two  former Volumes these are at your Service for your  third  which I find you are about  Yours SE  Aug d  LETTERS OF Mr POPE to Miss BLOUNT  To Miss  B****  BLOUNT  on the Death of her Brother  MADAM  _HAving no less Admiration for your Courage and good Nature than Sympathy with your Grief I am so highly sensible of both the one and the other that if I were capable to render you those Commendations which were justly due to you and that Comfort whereof you stand in need I must confess I should be much  troubled where to begin for what Obligations can be more equally inforcing than to render to so eminent a Virtue the Honour it merits and to so violent Affliction the Comfort it requires But I am to blame to put a Distance between these two things since Charity has so perfectly united them that the fond Assistance you afforded your late Brother should now prove an extraordinary Comfort to you since God will bestow that on you out of Justice which others obtain out of his Indulgence his infinite Goodness being such as will not suffer unrewarded so exemplary an Act of Tenderness as what thro' a Contempt of your own Life engaged you in the Offices of the best and tenderest Sister in the World beyond the Limits of all Obligations and by an admirable Constancy made you assur'd amidst a Danger that terrifies the most daring  Upon this Account am I confident that he will preserve you from it  The  SmallPox  and will shower on you as a Reward of your Virtue the Blessings which are wished you by  Madam  Yours c  To the SAME  MADAM  I Here send you the Elegy  This with some other Poetical Pieces will be found in our FOURTH Volume  which you have but too often demanded of me and which heretofore hath indeed been heard by others but till now hath not been read by any  It is my Wish that the same Fortune may in this happen to me as hath befallen you who after you have for so long time concealed the noblest things in the World have in the Discovery of it dazled all those that have seen it But it is an overgreat Fondness for my own Verses to wish them that Advantage nor indeed should I wish them better since they were not made for you If you think them very ill you are so much the more obliged to me for them in that knowing it as well as you yet I have not forborn sending them to you And to deal freely with you a less Power than what you have within these few Days gained upon me would not have been sufficient  to have prevailed with me to do it And without your Command Madam they had never known any other Place than that of my own Memory But it is high time it were delivered of them to make room for something more delightful I mean that which Mrs **** had the Grace to acquaint me with the other Day and which fills it so much at present that I doubt whether there be Place for any thing else  I perceive Madam that where it was my Design to send you a Letter of Excuse and Compliment I am fallen into one of Love but I wish all the other Defects you shall find in it were as pardonable as that In the mean time let me assure you that I have not of a long time been so engaged and that there are many in the World to whom I would not say so much even tho' they held a Dagger at my Throat  But since there is no fear of any Scandal you are obliged Madam at least in my Opinion to look favourably on those Elements of Affection were it but to see how I should behave myself if I should fall in Love and if I were permitted what might be the Consequence of it  I am Madam c  To the SAME  MADAM  THO' my Liberty were as you say greater than  Alexander  's it were more than recompenced by the Thanks you have been pleased to return it Even his Ambition as insatiable as it was would by so extraordinary a Favour have been limited He would have valued this Honour more highly than the  Persian  Diadem and he would not have envied  Achilles  the Praises of  Homer  might he have Yours In like manner Madam considering the Reputation you do me if I envy his it is not so much that which he hath acquired as what you have bestowed on him and he hath received no Honours which I do not look upon below my own unless it be that you do him when you call him your Gallant Neither his own Vanity nor his Flatterers have ever advanced any thing so advantageous to him and the Quality of the Son of  Jupiter Ammon  was not so glorious as that But if nothing can cure me of  the Jealousy I have of it yet Madam knowing you as I do I am confident if you do him that Favour it is not so much because he is the greatest of Mankind as because it is Two Thousand Years since he was  However it be we may see in this the Greatness of his Fortune which not able to forsake him so many Years after his Death adds to his Conquests a Person which celebrates them more than the Wife and Daughter of  Darius  and hath reinfused into him a Soul greater than that of the World he hath subdued  I should fear by your Example to write in too high a Stile but can a Man aim at one too high speaking of you and  Alexander  I beseech you Madam to assure your self I have for you the same Passion which you have for him and that the Admiration of your Virtues shall ever engage me to be Madam  Yours c  To the SAME  MADAM  I Could never believe it possible that the Receipt of a Letter from you should add to my Affliction or that you could have possibly sent me such bad News as that you could not comfort me at the same time  I thought my Unhappiness at such a Point as could not admit of any Addition and that since you were able something to strengthen my Patience to endure the Absence of your Mother and You there could not be any Misfortune which You could not have encouraged me to suffer But give me leave to tell you that I have found the contrary in the Affliction I have for the Death of Mrs  A****  which hath been heavy enough to crush me and wanted not much to spend the Remainder of my Patience  You may easily judge Madam what an excessive Grief it must needs be to me to have lost a Friend so good so sprightly and so accomplished as she and one that having always given me so many Expressions of her Affection would needs do something when she had not many Hours to continue here But tho' I reflected not on my own Concernments yet could I not but infinitely regret a Person by whom you were infinitely beloved and who among many particular Endowments had that of knowing you as much as may be and esteeming you above all things Yet I must confess if this Disturbance can admit of any Remission it is to reflect on the Constancy she expressed and the Fortitude wherewith she hath suffered a Thing whereof the Name would make her tremble at any time  I am extremely comforted to understand that at her Death she had those Qualities which only she wanted in her Life and that she so opportunely found Courage and Resolution When I consider it seriously it is somewhat against my Conscience to bemoan her and methinks it speaks an overinterested Affection to be sad because she hath left us to better her Condition and is gone into the other World  from  whose Bourne no Traveller returns  HAMLET  to find that Quiet she could never meet with in this  I very heartily entertain the Exhortations you give me thereupon which is often to con over a Lesson so profitable and necessary and to prepare myself for the like one Day I know how to make my Advantage of your Remonstrance The Miseries we have run thro' all this while is no small Preparation for it There's no better Lecture to instruct a Man how to die well than not to take much Pleasure in living  But if it be not impossible for the Hopes that Fortune proposes to prove effectual if after so many Years we may presume to expect some few fair Days be pleased to give me leave Madam to entertain Thoughts more diverting than those of Death and if it be likely that we are shortly to see one another let me not fall out with my Life  Where you say  You think me destined to great Things  you give so great Security of my Life and so happy a Presage of the Adventures that shall happen to me that I shall not be sorry for its Continuance yet  a while For my part if Destiny doth promise me any thing that is good I assure you I will do my utmost to get it I will contribute all I can thereto that  your Prophesies may be fulfilled  In the mean time I beseech you to be confident that of all the Favours I can beg of Fortune what I most passionately desire is that she would do for you what she ought and for myself only afford me the Means to acquaint you with the Passion which obliges me to be so much  Madam  Your c  NB  The WORKS of VOITURE

Copy of the Lord  Holles  's Memoirs in Answer to a Letter sent his Grace by Mr  Curll  the Bookseller  To Mr CURLL  Sir  THese Memoirs go no farther than the Parliament's resolving to treat no more with the King My Lord  Holles  was of the Presbyterian Party zealous at first to take Arms against the King but would not have carried it so far as the Independents did he writes very virulently against them gives Instances of  Cromwell  's and  Haslerig  's Cowardice as may be seen in the annexed Table  Alluding to the Table in the Manuscript  mentions Lord  Savile  as an Impostor who accused himself and others  This Book is an Apology for the  Scots  and  English  Presbyterians and a Satire against the Army and Independents but wrote in so angry and declaiming a Stile that it does not please me it treats only of public Facts known to every body and tells none of those secret Intrigues Schemes Conferences  c  which are what is most valuable in these sort of Books  SHREWSBERRY    TO Mr CURLL Bookseller c  Ch Ch Oxford  Jan  SIR  I Am very glad it was ever in my Power to do you any good Office  The Favour I received from this very worthy Prelate was the drawing up a List of the Chancellors of  Norwich  printed at the End of Sir  Thomas Browne  's Antiquities of that Cathedral  and should be ready to do the same again especially in a Cause of Justice and Truth But your Author in his  Defense  of the CLARENDONFAMILY  Bishop  Atterbury  's Defense of the Earl of  Clarendon  is an irrefragable Answer to the  latent Lye  hatched and propagated by Messrs  Ducket  and  Oldmixon  for I believe the  dead Man Smith  wholly innocent  See the  ClarendonFamily  Vindicated Printed for  E Curll  vo  must not Appeal to me on Account of any Interpolations in the Characters of that Famous History for  I have no such Originals nor ever saw any  It was reported that his Lordship had such a MS which was the Motive of my writing to him  EC  I have great Reason to believe that  That Work  was as faithfully published as ever any  Posthumous Piece  was which I believe will shortly be made evident to the Public by a more able Hand  To the New Edition of the Earl of  Clarendon  's History printed at  Oxford  is prefixed Bishop  Atterbury  's Defence which is sufficient  I am Sir Your Humble Servant THOM ASAPH Elect  TO Sir BERKELEY LUCY Bart  SIR  WHAT Mr  Nelson  in his Life of Bishop  Bull  says of that learned Prelate may with the strictest Veracity be applied to Mr  Collins viz  "He hath received so great a Brightness from his own Pen that it needs no auxiliary Light to increase its Lustre"  and his Character is so secure from the Example of his Life that all Calumnies raised against it fly like  Chaff before the Wind  By a Letter from  King  'sCollege  Cambridge  I am informed  "that Mr  Collins  was bred at  Eton  in quality of an Oppidane where he was very remarkable even while a Boy for a good Taste of the Classics  c  He was admitted a FellowCommoner of  King  'sCollege  July  where under the Tuition of Dr  Hare  he was soon perceived to grow indefatigable in the roughest Tracts of Philosophy particularly the  Ars Cogitandi  He was almost a singular Example among those of his Station  Rarus ferme communis sensus in illa fortuna  says  Horace  is as applicable to a Man of flourishing Circumstances as to the Patriot and tho' it has been much controverted what was the Poet's View yet in both Lights Mr  Collins  has been thought to be an Exception"  Since Mr LOCKE hath declared that he  considered Mr  COLLINS  as a Philosopher and a Christian  all the sneering and lucrative Sarcasms of  Ecclesiastics  ought to be held in the utmost Contempt His Character is so secure from the Example of his Life that I am the less concerned for my own Inability to embalm his Memory especially as the Weight and Importance of the Matter will make some Amends for those Defects which may arise from the Manner of handling it  That Part of  Biography  Sir which records Men famous in the Republic of Letters is generally acceptable to the Learned because it attempteth to gratify a Curiosity which prevaileth much and is nourished among them whereby they are prompted to search for and enquire after the minutest Circumstances which relate to such Authors who are no otherwise known to them than by the Works they have left behind them  And now Sir as the best and most firm Basis I can lay for the Support of my Superstructure give me Leave to mortify the wrangling Priesthood by exhibiting the sincere Sentiments Mr  Locke  had of Mr  Collins  's Virtues and Abilities A Character which I am certain with all those who knew his intrinsic Worth will turn the Balance even against the Constitutions of Popes the Decrees of Councils or the Cavils of Convocations  "You have exceedingly obliged me says Mr  Locke  to Mr  Collins  in the Books  of Yours  that you have sent me and  continues our immortal Christian Philosopher  I am overjoyed with an Intimation I have received  also  that gives me Hopes of seeing You next Week You are a charitable good Friend and are resolved to make the Decays and Dregs of my Life the pleasantest Part of it for I know nothing calls me back to a pleasant Sense of Enjoyment and makes my Days so gay and lively as your good Company Come then and multiply happy Minutes upon and rejoice in the Good you do me for I am with a perfect Esteem and Respect"  Yours c  Upon Mr  Collins  's Return to Town after paying the Visit mentioned in the foregoing Letter Mr  Locke  returns him the following Acknowledgment  I owe you my Thanks for the greatest Favour I can receive the Confirmation of your Friendship by the Visit I lately received from you  In some other Letters he thus expresses himself  There is one Mr  Collins  with whom if I desire to live upon equal Terms it is not that I forget how much he is superior to me in many Things wherein he will always have the PrecedencyYou make my Life since I have had  your  Friendship much more valuable to me than it was beforeTho' my Friendship be of very little Value or Use yet being the best Thing I have to give I shall not forwardly bestow it where I do not think there is Worth and Sincerity And therefore pray pardon me the Forwardness wherewith I throw my Arms about your Neck and holding you so tell you you must not hope by any Thing that looks like Compliment to keep one at a civiller and more fashionable DistanceYours of the th Instant  Of  Feb    makes me love and value you if it were possible more than I did before you having therein  in short so well described wherein the Happiness of a rational Creature in this World consists Tho' there are very few who make any other Use of their halfemployed and undervalued Reason but to bandy against it 'Tis well as you observe that they agree as ill with one another as they do with common Sense For when by the Influence of some prevailing Head they all lean one Way Truth is sure to be borne down and there is nothing so dangerous as to make any Enquiry after her and to own her for her own sake is the most unpardonable Crime'Tis no small Advantage to me to have found such a Friend at the last Scene of my Life when I am good for nothing and am grown so useless that I cannot but be sure that in every good Office you do me you can propose to your self no other Advantage but the Pleasure of doing it  Letter of  March    Give me leave to desire you to bestow some of your spare Hours on the  Epistles to the Corinthians  Mr  Locke  's Paraph on those Epistles  and to try whether you can find them intelligible or noIf I regret my old Age it is you that make me and calls me back to the World just as I was leaving of it and leaving it as a Place that had very little valuable in it But  who would not be glad to spend some Years with youHe that has any thing to do with you must own that Friendship is the natural Product of your Constitution and your Soul a noble Soil is enriched with the  two  most valuable Qualities of human Nature  Truth  and  Friendship  What a Treasure have I then in such a Friend with whom I can converse and be enlightened about the highest Speculations  Souls Sir  Berkeley  endowed like Mr  Locke  's Mr  Collin  's or  your own  were made to converse with each other only far very far removed from the Insolence of Priests or the Pedantry of Schools such stoical Apathy as they  were  and you  are  possessed with put Mr  Addison  upon leaving us this perpetual Memento in his  Campaign  Great Souls by Instinct to each other turn  Demand Alliance and for Friendship burn  Rais'd of themselves their genuine Charms they boast  And those who paint them  truest  praise them  most  These Characteristics given of Mr  Collins  by Mr  Locke  will surely make every  little  or indeed the  greatest  Canonical Pedagogue dread to attack the Memory of  our dear Friend especially when they find the Esteem he had for him reached even beyond the Grave  See Mr  Locke  's Pieces vo p where is a Letter thus Superscribed by Mr  Locke  For  Anthony Collins  Esq  to be deliver'd to him after my Decease  and with which Testimonial I shall close what I have to offer on this Head for the present  "The Knowledge I have of your Virtue of all Kinds secures the Trust which by your Permission I have placed in you*May you live long and happy in the Enjoyment of Health Freedom Content and all those Blessings which Providence has bestowed on you and your Virtue intitles you to I know you loved me  Living  and will preserve my Memory now I am  Dead  All the Use to be made of it is That  this Life  is a  Scene of Vanity that soon passes away and affords no solid Satisfaction but in the Consciousness of doing well and in the Hopes of another Life  This is what  I  can say upon  Experience  and what  You  will find to be  true  when  You  come to  make up the Account  Adieu I leave my best Wishes with you"  JOHN LOCKE  I am Sir Berkeley Lucy's most Obedient Humble Servant EC  A LETTER To Mr P***  _REJOICE with me my Friend there is Probability of mine Advancement this is the Reign of Expectancy Never if not now shall I become considerable Places of National and mighty Trust are given to those the World will trust no longer Emulous of the  Roman  Simplicity our Nobility like so many CINCINNATUS's seem to be taken from the Plough our Clergy representing the Mechanic Piscatory Founders of Christianity are Men of mean Descent and altogether as eminent for their Ignorance But as the uninterrupted Succession of their Apostleship is most undeniable the Lord inspire these with those  Saul  from a Tender  of his Father's ASSES became a tender Father to the People  Israel  and left his former Care  Caesar  too was called to be a King but he retained his ASSES some he made Judges some Bishops and some Ambassadors which occasioned the Scoffers to say that  Caesar  only wore the  Lion  's Skin What led me I believe to this Subject was the hearing of Papers now crying about the Streets intitled  The Congress of Asses  which naturally brought to my Remembrance many Folks and Occurrences both at Home and Abroad We have a Poet Laureat here Thanks to my Lord Chamberlain now grown old who is twice aYear brought forth to be kicked at by his Brethren  The Heels of ev'ry  Ass  salute  old C  If Dean  B  or Doctor  S  pride themselves too highly on the Linguose Faculty may not the Ass of  Balaam  serve for their Reproof as well as he did for that of his Master Nothing seems to me more unjust than the Contempt which is offered to this noble ANIMAL by the Vulgar who mistake his solemn Majesty for Dullness Should this Epistle ever appear in Public as I hope it never will I am sensible it would be thought an insinuating  Artifice of mine to get a Place at Court or recommend myself to Somebody in Power whereas I have no such Intention I assure you but shall disinterestedly and without Flattery as far as I am able take away part of the Burden from the Back of this generous Beast For What is heavier than an ill Name in doing which I have only imitated the renowned  Osborn's  and  Walsingham's  of these our Times whose Labours I must acknowledge to be as far superior to mine as they are more difficult But to proceed ASSES formerly were not contemptible their Names were not made a Reproach they sometimes were cloathed in Furs like our Aldermen and sometimes in Scarlet and Cloath of Gold and King's and Princes used to ride upon them  Midas  a  Phrygian  Monarch had himself the Ears of an Ass which was in those Days held an uncommon Thing Kings will not out of brotherly Affection despise them moreover this stately Beast is not to be prevailed upon by Blows the venerable Dispensers of our Laws are not endowed with more Gravity all the Holygifted ones should respect him as an Elder and one of themselves for he once spoke by the same Divine Power they would be thought to speak by Besides he has that in him which is well Worthy of  their Imitation I mean his  Patience  Both Sacred and Profane History have emblematized Strength and Heroism by the Ass than which nothing can be more natural noble beautiful or just  Jacob  when he blesses his Sons says Issachar  is a strong  Ass  crouching down between two Burdens  And  Homer  in the Eleventh Book of the  Iliad  compares  Ajax  making a noble Retreat to one of these  Animals  forcing his Way into a Field of Corn there satisfying his Hunger and then retiring with a tardy sullen Intrepidity Maugre the Opposition of a Troop of Boys  Whose ratt'ling Strokes resound upon his Sides  Had I nothing else to offer in their Behalf the abovementioned Instances are sufficient to abate all Ridicule and draw Respect from the viperous Tongue of Calumny itself  But farther the most eminent Poets Orators Historians and Naturalists have not thought it beneath them to treat of the Ass either in Metaphor Simile or Description Narrative  Pliny Lib    Cap  gives large Account of him describes his Nature Passions  c  and shews us what Judgment we are to form of the prickingup and what from the limber and halferected Position of his Ears  Virgil  mentions him but sparingly  Horace  more frequent the  Thirteenth Epistle of his First Book  is wrote  Ad Vinnium Asellum  whom he banters on his  Name  He was to present  Horace  's Poems to  Augustus  who desires  if they are too burthensome to him that he will cast them away and not bear them like Panniers to be laugh'd at and get the Surname of  Ass  because his Paternal one was  ASELLA  Cicero  speaks of one  Asellius Sempronius  an Historian by which we know this Name to have been considerable with the  Romans  There are likewise  two  Stars in  Cancer  called the ASELLI and  Silenus  the FosterFather of  Bacchus  according to  Ovid  was always mounted upon an Ass I shall here repeat something truly Poetical spoken of the Ass in our own Language not inferior to any thing of the Ancients It is taken from the DUNCIAD where no less than a Goddess proclaims several Sorts of Games and promises a Drum to him of all her Favourites who shall outvoice the Ass  And his this  Drum  whose hoarse Heroic Base  Drowns the loud Clarion of the braying  Ass  First having encouraged her Children they begin the Sports the Goddess thus giving the Word of Command  Sound forth my Brayers and the Welkin rend  As when the longear'd milky Mothers wait  At some sick Miser's triplebolted Gate  For their defrauded absent Foals they make  A Moan so loud that all the Guild awake  Sore sighs Sir  Gilbert  starting at the Bray  From Dreams of Millions and three Groats to pay  So swells each Windpipe  Ass  intones to  Ass  Harmonic Twang of Leather Horn and Brass  Such as from lab'ring Lungs th' Enthusiast blows  High Sounds attempted to the vocal Nose  But far o'er all Sonorous  Blackmore  's strain  Walls Steeples Skies bray back to him again  In  Tot'nhamFields  the Brethren in amaze  Prick all their Ears up and forget to graze  Long  Chanc'ryLane  retentive rolls the Sound  And Courts to Courts return it round and round  Thames  wafts it thence to  Rufus'  roaring Hall  And  Hungerford  reechoes Bawl for Bawl  Scarce do I know whether the Ass is more indebted to the Poet for this excellent Description of him or the Poet to the Ass for those Qualifications of his which were the Occasion of it But certain I am that every Language is enriched with many terse Sayings Proverbs and Sentences drawn from the known Qualities of this Quadrupede  fait en dos d'Asne  signifies any Thing done with Cunning  Asinus Antronius  is a LobCock  Asinus ad Lyram  and  in the Greek are Proverbs which seem to reflect upon the Ass for his Unskilfulness in Music whereas the contrary is manifest for this Animal pays an extraordinary Attention to every sort of WindMusic as may be easily discover'd by the prickingup of his Ears his simpering Gesture his frolic Spurning of the Heels attended by the Clangor of his own Pipe with a seeming Desire to bear a Part It is most unquestionable that he has the Advantage of all other Beasts the Sounds he utters being more articulate And many learned Critics agree that no living Pipe so nearly resembles the Hautboy Bagpipe or that more admired newinvented WaterMusic the FrenchHorn the Performers upon which Instruments if he does  not excel every body will readily allow it is not for want of  Ear  Sir  Richard Blackmore  was sneered at by the Critics but what will not Critics sneer for applying the Word  Bray  to the Sound of Armour War  c  which must needs have been right in him for if the Hero himself is justly likened to an Ass there is as it were a Chain of Propriety in comparing the Noise of Arms and Clangor of the Battle to Braying  Vide Milton lib lin  Arms on Armour clashing bray'd  Horrible Discord  Sir  Richard  we see was but a later Copiest of this Beauty he it seems stole it from  Milton  who stole it from  Homer  who stole it from the Ancients his Predecessors who copied from Nature  There are others also who reflect upon the Ass for his Ears which is whimsical indeed and I doubt not but that this Clamour proceeds from those only who have lost their Own While I treat of this Subject methinks I feel some of that Assistance which the Poets so often call for I am hurried away a Flood of Fire pours itself upon me Nature is overpower'd violently Thou O Art assist me to restrain her Force lo I again subside steady is my Seat and tight my Rein How copious is the Theme I handle surely  the World could not contain the Volumes which might be wrote upon it What I can say is nothing it would not be esteemed as a Sentence in the great Folio twelve Books each twelve Times bigger than DoomsDayBook are to be wrote solely upon the Milk of this Animal It is Mother's Milk to half the Nation It is the Kettle of  Medaea  the Waters of  Aganippe  to this is owing our remarkable Progress in the liberal Sciences and polite Literature to this is owing the Politics so nobly defended by  Walsingham  and  Osborne  to this is owing the Histories of the  Burnets  the  Cookes  and the  Oldmixons  the Divinity of the  Henleys  and the  Fosters  the Physic of the  Misaubins  and the  Wards  the Poetry of the  Fieldings  and the  Savages  And to this is owing these my Labours To this also but whether am I going those of our Party already mention'd are sufficient How greatly have they laboured to be thought Asses and how greately have they succeededHere I must take Notice of a remarkable Instance of the Ass's Principles if that Expression may be permitted me when our immortal Deliverer landed at  Torbay  the vociferous Acclamation of a congregated Drove was heard by Multitudes of his Followers and if I am not misinformed the famous Dr  Burnet  assured them  it was a happy Omen and I doubt not but that upon the Publication of the second Volume of his History we shall find that he after his usual pious Manner has discover'd Providence to be eminently interested in favour of that Undertaking from the Declaration these Animals made as a sort of joining with their own Party  I have already exceeded the Limits of a Letter and shall conclude after I have interpreted two Fables famous for their Antiquity  First Oenus  a Ropemaker in Hell had an Ass always standing by him who as fast as he twisted the Cord bit it asunder his Labour was thereby rendered abortive eternally renewed eternally frustrated  Oenus  resembles those hellish Ministers who thro' their evil Counsels make Ropes to bind the People in Slavery By the Ass is meant the honest Patriot who ever watchful for the public Safety destroys his Schemes discovers his Designs drives him to invent new Mischief which he still renders ineffectual by his Vigilance  Secondly  An Ass being honoured with carrying on his Back the Statue of  Isis  the People bowed fell on their Knees and worshipped the Goddess The Ass thinking his Merit to be the Cause of their Adoration grew insolent and proud  But when he was unloaded they convinced him by Blows it was not him they respected  By the Ass you are to understand all such as have Places at Court what Respect they meet with is not paid to them but to their Office from which when they are once discarded every Man carries a Cudgel which will convince them of the Truth of what I say I am my dear Friend in all Shapes comforted with Hopes and Expectations  Yours c PHILOAs  LOVE LETTERS BY Mrs MANLEY  ADVERTISEMENT  THIS small Packet of Letters tho' written under the Fatigue of Travelling is a delightful Proof of the true Taste both of the Thoughts and Sense of their inimitable Author All who had the Happiness of her Conversation were soon convinced how free she was from the general Frailties of her Sex what a Nobleness and Generosity of Temper she possessed how distant her Views from the least Appearance of SelfInterest or mean Design How often have I heard her compassionately regretting the Miseries of Mankind and never her own but when they prevented her extensive Charity to Others  Never was she Vindictive against the most inveterate Enemy the innate Softness of her Soul rendered her Deportment equally obliging to Friends and Foes and never did she resent but with the strictest Justice  A Journey to  Exeter  was undertaken by her on account of a LawSuit in the Year and two Years afterwards these Letters were made public without her Leave by  JH  James Hargrave  late of the  Middle Temple  Esq  Esq  so highly was she disgusted at this ungenerous Treatment that she caused them to be suppressed  The Copy from which this Edition is reprinted I received from her own Hands

for granted he  likes  me and would have me do the  same  by him As he came in he put off his Travelling Suit for a Coat and Vest designed to dazzle the Curate and all his Congregation The Way I took to mortify his Foppery was not to speak a Word of the Change which made him extream uneasy At length cut of all Patience he desired my Opinion if his Taylor had used him well What the Brocade was worth a Yard How many Ounces of SilverFringe And recommended to my Curiosity the exquisite Workmanship of the Loops and then gave me the Sum Total of his Cost I answered him That Finery was lost upon me I neither was nor pretended to be a Judge He pertly answered He perceived by my Sullenness that I had a great deal of Wit tho' I understood he had but little by his Remark Well all this did not do He would fain have had me enquired into his Family Intrigues and Fortune which when he perceived I had no Curiosity for 'Faith Madam  says he  I beg your Ladyship's Opinion if I am not the most unfortunate Man breathing I'll tell you a very mortifying Adventure Nay you must hear me I vow this Indifferency does not look natural to you  your Eyes promise us much more Fire  I'll shut 'em thought I for ever rather than such a Fop shall find any thing to like them for  What no Answer Madam  says he  I perceive your Attention by your Silence 'Gad I love a Person of your Breeding that know themselves better than to interrupt a good Story Perhaps Madam is not well with her Journey  answered Mrs  Mayoress  of  Totness Alas I wonder Riding in the Coach should not have got you a better Stomach Poor Gentlewoman she has scarce eat any thing I'll recompence that by a Feast of the Mind  answered my Fop  How say you Madam shall I begin the  Regalio  I had as good consent  quoth I  With or without my Leave I see you are resolv'd upon it Well then Madam  says he  since you are disposed to be delighted I'll about it instantly  It happened at  Oxford  three Months ago where I often came my Father's Estate being not far distant I saw a Lady and fell in Love with her ay Gad Madam downright in Love with her She was a Person genteely bred and had seen the  BeauMonde  made the  Tour  of all the Places of Gallantry shined in the DrawingRoom languished in the Boxes adorned the Park in a Word was all a Man of my Circumstances  could desire in one he was resolved to make an Oblation of his Heart to But as her Honour was my Care and not marrying my Design I searched for a dexterous Pretence to visit and be happy I took Mr  Slye  with me a Gentleman of the Town who had a Wife To give you the Character of my Friend He was naturally amorous had a handsome Person and Strains of natural Wit beyond whatever I saw in the most Acquired and your Ladyship must allow me to be a Judge of Wit by so dexterously finding out yours maugre your Silence I bowed for this extraordinary Compliment and thought I could not more agreeably return it than by continuing my Silence and as the Poet has it  left him to his dear Mistake  Mr  Slye  continued he was to propose a Marriage between me and my Lady  Conquest  to the old People her Relations whom she was just come to live with But as soon as he saw her if I was her First  Oxford  Victim he was certainly the Second and as I found presently took with her She had a very fine Hand which Mr  Slye  according to the Country Liberty kissed and then with  Cleveland  said  So soft 'tis Air but once remov'd  Tender as 'twere a Jelly Glov'd  She gave him a Look which seemed to say she wondered in that Place at such a Piece of Gallantry and then pursuing with her Wit the Victory of her Eyes charm'd my Friend to that Degree that he told me he must enjoy her or die  'Gad Madam was not this a very odd Turn I carried him to speak for me and he comes to make me the Confidant of his Designs  We agreed tho' as Friends should to keep our mutual Confidence secret from her and to endeavour each of us to make himself happy and faithfully to relate the Progress of our Amours But because the Country is much given to Tatling the Pretensions of Marriage went on Lady  Conquest  was Airy and Coquet loved Company and Gallantry if they could be purchased with Safety But she knew so well how to manage every body that none durst speak to her more than she had a mind to hear I was one of the awed Fools  'Gad would you believe Madam that Love could make so great an Ass of a Man of my Understanding  And yet it was not altogether that neither my Pride was concerned I was resolv'd not to serve for her Diversion till I was sure she was consenting to be mine but could no more keep out of her Company than I could hang myself I desired her to walk She consented with a  Crony she picked up upon Condition I would engage Mr  Slye  of the Party I was jealous but to no Purpose either my Rival's Company or not my Mistress's  Slye  pretended Fear of his Wife that he durst not appear in public with any other Woman for she already began to have Apprehensions of my Lady  Conquest  whose Way of Living was remote to those of CountryGentlewomens and therefore he was resolved to think no more of her tho' infinitely pleasing to him for his Fortune depended in a great measure upon his Wife's Mother I came back with this doleful News to Lady  Conquest Go tell him  answered she  he who has pretended to love me should fear nothing more than not being beloved and that I command him to meet us at the appointed Place  I ran like a Fool to do her Message which I believed Raillery because she ought to have been more cautious of a married Man's Love if serious  Slye  wanted but Intreaty He consented and we met but not to my Comfort tho' the Expence was mine he had the Profit She was not easy unless he sat nigh her she talked to him stared at him did every thing to shew she was pleased whilst I by a Notion of Pride would pretend nothing for fear I should not have all  For 'Gad Madam I do not love being baulked thus  Several Times we met but all  as little to the Purpose Undoubtedly she saw I loved her but would not see because I was of Use in her Affair with  Slye  The whole Town talked of our approaching Wedding and I began to be Fool enough to resolve on it thro'  Slye  's Persuasion who continually extolled her Honour and Virtue and tickled my Pride with the News of her Love but that she wanted a Declaration from me before I could expect a Confession from her I told him I would think on it and so we parted That Night as Chance would have it I passed along by the House where she lived and I found the Gate open I know not what Devil of Curiosity carried me in and when in to go to her Chamber I did both unseen and concealed myself behind the Bed which I saw sitted for Night I resolved to wait till she should be in Bed and then to take Advantage of her Woman's Absence who lay in the AntiChamber and there to declare my Love and offer her Marriage Long I had not waited  tho' 'Gad Madam I was very impatient and thought every Minute Seven  when the charming Fair came from her DressingRoom with nothing on but her NightGown and Slippers which were soon thrown off and the Goddess appeared more beauteous than the naked Queen of Love The happy Bed soon received her  and she cryed  Haste and bring my Lover to me  At these Words her Woman went into the AntiChamber and returned softly with  Slye  who flew to her Arms sighed kissed and died there  Imagine my Surprize  'Twas so great I could not in a long time shew myself to interrupt 'em At length seeing him undress for Bed 'Gad Madam my Patience was quite expired  Traytor  says I shewing myself  Is it thus thou preservest thy feigned Duty to thy Wife  I laid my Hand upon my Sword and he did the like on his and we had certainly drawn had not the Amorous Fair thrown herself out of Bed between us and conjured us on her Knees to make no Noise else she was lost for ever I raised her naked Beauties and carried them whence they came but complained at my hard Fortune which had made me the Instrument of my own Ruin She saw I was extreamly touched at it and after her Shame and Surprize was a little over  You have no Reason Sir  said she  to complain of me I could have no Engagements with a Man who never pretended to love me Tho' you have given me the Glory of refusing you as a Husband in the Eyes of the Town it could not but nettle me to know there was nothing serious on your Side but done like a Gentleman to secure my Reputation amongst illbred  Fools who know not the Charms of Conversation and will not permit it without Censure to those that do But 'Gad Madam  answered I  your Ladyship is not so dull but to know I loved you All my Assiduities Uneasiness Sighs and Ogleings must have informed you Our Sex dares hardly believe yours  she replied  when you take Pains to speak And sure it were an unpardonable Vanity to draw such Consequences without it These Circumstances you pretend I have found common to all Gentlemen Therefore must I conclude the whole World is in Love with me and deny myself those who tell me they are my Servants for the vain Imagination that another is silently so 'Gad Madam  answered I  I cannot possibly forgive the Preference of a dull silly sober married Man to an airy welldressed young amorous One I will be gone to  London  by Break of Day for fear I should not conceal my Resentments and so injure your Ladyship irreparably For 'Gad Madam I must repeat again you were to blame to slight all the Pains I took to breed you for nobler Game  This last I confess broke my splenetic Silence and I could not hold laughing heartily which amply paid my Squire for the Pains he had taken in his Relation He concluded it with telling me his Journey to  London  and short Stay there only to accouter  his Design of visiting a LadySister married into  Devonshire  And closed with Lauds to his good Fortune that had thrown him into a Coach with a Lady of my Charms and Sense to whom he had sacrificed the Relicks of Lady  Conquest  the first Minute that he saw me I answered him That I found Experience had made him resolve against losing a Second Mistress for want of speaking He had Manners sufficient or rather Conscience to think he had given me enough of his  Beau  self for one Day and withdrew  I could not forbear late as it was sending you an Account If you laugh in your Turn I am paid for my Pains as well as the Squire It is now past Eleven and they will call us by Two Good Night I am going to try if I can drown in Sleep that which most sensibly affects me the cruel Separation we have so lately suffered  DM  LETTER III  DO not you think I am more constant than your Friendship could hope or mine pretend to I think it a great Proof of it amidst the Fatigues of a WestCountry Journey to give you thus duly an Account of my insignificant self and Travels We parted from  HartleyRow  at Three this Morning thro' a Croud of Beggars who watch our Coach for Alms and will never leave it unblessed Hence my  Beau  took Occasion of  Simile  bid me to observe how wakeful those Wretches were for small Charities that he would do the like in hopes of greater and that my divine Idea had so filled his Sight he could not resolve to let Sleep intrude for fear of shutting me out I perceived he took Pains to be thought uneasy and I have more good Manners than to disappoint him Mrs  Mayoress  now she is acquainted has all the low disagreeable Familiarity of People of her Rank She entertained us all the Morning with a sorry Lovebusiness  about her Second Husband Stuff so impertinent I remember nothing of it  Beau  continues in his Assiduities I think none was ever so plagued with dying Eyes his are continually in that Posture and my Opposites that I am forced to take a good deal of Pains to avoid them The two other FellowTravellers were never so promoted before and are much troubled their Journey is to last no longer and wish the four Days four Months I hope every Jolt will squash their Guts and give them enough of it But they are Proof against any such Disasters and hugely delighted with what they are pleased to call  Riding in State  After this ridiculous Account you need not doubt but I am thoroughly mortified The  Trouts  are just brought upon the Table which are the only good Thing here they look inviting and will not stay for cooling Compliments I hope Time will shew none to say  I am unalterably yours DM  SUTTON  June  LETTER IV  I Cannot give myself any Reason why these Coachmen are such unreasonable Rogues They make us rise at Two in the Morning to bring us into our Inn at the same Hour in the Afternoon After we were reposed a little  Beau  shined again as Yesterday and waited upon me to EveningPrayers I need say nothing to you of  Salisbury  Cathedral If in a foreign Country as the LADY in her  Letters  of  Spain  The Countess D'  Annois  's Travels into  Spain  I could entertain you with a noble Description but you have either seen or may see it and so I will spare my Architecture There are abundance of pretty innocentlooked Women genteel enough but I have lost my Heart to a'handsome Churchman I never thought before that Dress was tolerable but so wore it seems a mighty Ornament He was placed behind me but I turned my Devotion and kneeled to him imagining him no less than as in Antique Days some  High Priest of the Sun The Canon gave me Cause to think he had dined too well and was obliged to his Snuff more than Religion for keeping him awake Well Devotion done I was forced to break up mine and leave him without a Knowledge of his Conquest As we were walking to our Inn I asked  Beau  what we should do to pass the next Day without being very weary of each other for  Sunday  does not permit Travelling He you may be sure did not fail to tell me he could never be weary of me tho' himself expiring by my Sight and Cruelty I waved his Compliment and told him my Design of engaging the People in the  Exeter  Coach if they seemed worth it to live with us for the Time When we returned we were told it was not yet come in occasioned by the breaking of the Axletree five Miles off but that a Fellow was gone to mend it and they were expected every Moment My ChamberWindow answered the Court I rose to it at the Noise of the Coach and presently saw alight a tall blustering bigbon'd raw Thing like an overgrown SchoolBoy but conceited above any Thing He had an Appurtenance called a  Wife  whom he suffered to get out as well as she could As long as he had lain by her he did not think her worth the Civility of his Hand  She seemed a Giant of a Woman but very fine with a right Cit's Air He blustered presently for the best Lodging which he saw taken up by her that held the fine Fan before her Face You may guess this was your humble Servant The Chamberlain told him it was their Custom first come first served but that there were very good Chambers besides The rest of the Company were  two  Things that looked pert and aukward Tradesmens Daughters I judged them But methoughts casting my Eyes upon a Gentlewoman and her Servant that came out last I found something pleased me whether it were because she really deserved it or that the Stuff she was with set her off I had a Basin of fine HeartCherries before me just come from the Garden I caused them to be brought after me into the Gallery and designed them as a Bait to the Woman whom I was to begin the Acquaintance with for  Beau  designed to set up to get a Fortune in  Devonshire  and was unwilling to shew any Irregularity and I thought myself above their Reflections The first that appeared was the Wife with a rising Belly This seemed a good Hint I offered them to her not knowing but she might  long  The Sight I suppose did not displease her for she readily accepted and eat very greedily The Genteellooked  Lady had much to do to be persuaded As for the other  two  they were gone to chuse a Lodging We presently grew acquainted taking Travellers Liberty and supped together But shall I tell you the Wife grew jealous of me It seems her Temper was such and her Husband no small Man in his Country though himself just set up in Merchandizing at  London  his Father one of the Canons at  Exeter  thought he might carry all Hearts before him as well as the CountryLasses They were come from visiting their Friends and returning to their House in  London  Mrs  Stanhope  for that was the Lady's Name whom I liked told me I was not to count upon the Conquest for he had given her  Douceurs  all the Way and made her extream uneasy because his Wife appeared to be such We grew into an Intimacy and left the Company My  Beau  was to me faithless and inconstant One of the aukward little Things I told you of and who had a tolerable Face was a Goldsmith's Daughter of  Exeter  and acquainted with his LadySister that began their Acquaintance She seemed free and fond He took the Hint and applied himself to her which I was very glad of Mrs  Stanhope  went with me to my Chamber and after much Discourse offered Friendship and  mutual Knowledge of each other she gave me this Account of her last Adventure  I came now from  Falmouth says she  where I have been ever since the Beginning of the Spring to visit a Brother and his Wife who live there Until within these six Weeks I saw nothing that pleased me At last it was a Captain of a Man of War had the Chance my Brother brought him to his House And for my Excuse I must tell you he is a very pretty genteel young Gentleman of a good Family and Education and in Prospect of coming to very good Fortune They talked of the Town and Country Beauties At last a young Creature was named whom I had not seen but the Captain set her before every thing he had I was concerned at his Opinion and asked him his of the Duchess of  Grafton  He gave her due Praise but yet in his Esteem this exceeded I could not but think him extreamly in the Wrong and was angry when I heard him wish himself a Man of mighty Fortune to deserve her He sailed that Night and after ten Days Cruise came in again His first Visit was to me I asked him if he had seen his Mistress He said he had none I remembred him of what he had spoke He answered that I  had taught him better He continued his Applications visited me three Times a Day And because I was still jealous of his Words I had him watched and an Account brought of all his Visits The young Lady's Uncle made a Ball but because my Brother and he were not well together there was no Hopes of my being invited which my Lover very well knew and therefore said he would not be there having received Orders to sail He took his Leave with transporting Sorrow and had the Glory to find mine was real However I would not lose the Ball because I desired to see my reputed Rival I forgot to tell you he had never seen her but once when he praised her to that Degree and dexterously told me a second Sight had undeceived him I dressed myself like a Farmer's Wife with a Basket on my Arm and by the Help of one of the Servants was placed like a Country Gazer at the Corner of the Room I needed not to be told my Rival a thousand dazzling Charms distinguished her and tho' I looked with jealous Eyes must acknowledge I never saw any Beauty more perfect All my Hopes lay in a certain Softness which did not promise much Wit In a little Time my Traytor whom I imagined in the wide Ocean came to the Ball danced  with his Mistress and was as assiduous as she deserved I was so well pleased at the Discovery I stayed not for any more for fear I should not escape myself About Midnight he came for a Minute to see me and told me he was just come ashore the Ship under Sail yet without another Sight it was impossible for him to depart I confounded him with telling him what had so lately passed at the Ball Yet he drew himself out of the Embarrass and said every thing to make me think he loved me and we were seriously treating upon the Affair of Matrimony I told him he must get my Father's Consent who lived at  London  where I was going He begged me to defer my Journey till he came in which I too readily promised and so we parted I knew my Fortune fairer than my Rival's and began to be persuaded I had the better of her For what else could draw him to address me When I saw him return it was with mutual Joy But he was ordered that same Night to sail to  Plymouth  and did not expect to be back in a Week therefore we agreed upon my Journey He swore an inviolable Love and would have contracted himself if I durst without my Father's Consent He intended to write to his Friends above to ask it And thus we once more parted but not till he  had severely exclaimed against any Designs upon my Rival before a whole Crew of TownGossips that I was sure would tell her You may conclude we agreed upon Writing I took my Journey and stayed at an Aunt's House in  Exeter  Ten Days where I heard that within Four of my Departure my Lover returned and in three more was publickly married to my Rival I wrote to thank him for ridding me of a knavish Husband wished him Joy took Coach and resolved against too easily believing any Man again  The Post has just brought me a Letter from you I find you curse me with the Continuation of  Egham  Uneasiness till I return to the World in  London  Methinks it is unreasonable to impose the continued Slavery of Writing I assure you I shall take Truce with it till at my Journey's End unless something happen worth your Notice General  Talmash  's Body was brought in here this Evening His Secretary I am acquainted with and have sent to desire the Favour of his Company Tomorrow at Dinner and if any Thing in his Relation be entertaining you shall not fail of it from  Your Sincere Faithful Servant DM  Saturday Night from Salisbury  LETTER V  THE Account of so great a Man's Death as General  Talmash  This fine Gentleman died of his Wounds at  Portsmouth  which he received in the unfortunate Expedition before  Brest  Anno  in the middle of all his Enterprizes when Fortune seemed to promise him much greener Laurels than he had yet gathered has so added to my Melancholy that I will not describe his Misfortune to you for fear it be contagious but rather suffer you to expect the public Account For I am one of those that esteem you more than to make you uneasy as I think none can be otherwise that hears the Particulars of his Loss Something there was extreamly touching  After this doleful Subject methinks my  Beau  may justly complain I have so long a time neglected his most singular self We parted this Morning from our  Sunday  Acquaintance Fop told me when I gently reproached him for Inconstancy 'Gad Madam it is but to make myself the newer  to your Ladyship Tomorrow I rather thought it was to keep me such to him He has given me a Relation of his Success with the Damsel She treated him in her Chamber with  Rosa Solis  and what he calls  Sucket  The rest he could willingly have acquainted me with but I recommended Discretion in Ladies Affairs and he almost bursting is yet forced to be silent How long he will keep such I do not know for he has often offered at breaking his most painful Penance We have passed  Dorchester  and  Blandford  Today but I found nothing in either Place worth your Notice The Toils of the Body influence the Mind I suppose by my Dullness you find I speak woeful Truths We are lodged at  Bridgeport  and very ill but it is but for a Night Here is just come into the Inn an Acquaintance of  Beau  's who promises yielding Matter for Tomorrow's Letter This was infected in the Beginning by General  Talmash  and the most uneasy Journey as dully concludes it  Your ever Constant and Obliged Servant DM  Bridgeport  June  LETTER VI  BEAU  is now grown so  insipid  that I shall say very little of him for the future and I have Reason to believe myself  such  to him for these two last Evenings contrary to Custom he has not redressed The Fatigue which he seems more sensible of than any of us has tarnished the Lustre of his Eyes and instead of any farther Ogleing drowns all his amorous Pretensions in as profound Sleep as the uneasy Jolting of the Coach will permit This is what I can never be so happy to gain But to tell you something of our last Night's Entertainment Whilst Supper was getting ready the Gentleman I told you of at  Beau  's Intreaty gave us an Account of what Affairs were carrying him to  London  The short of it is this  Your Ladyship  says he  may soon perceive by my Accent that I am a Foreigner I had the Glory of following the Prince of  Orange  now our auspicious King in his  Expedition into  England  We landed in the West with all those Particulars which are needless to repeat During our Stay at  Exeter  I rendered my constant Devotion at the Cathedral and in coming thence one Evening an old Woman with a Look as mean as a Beggar presented me a Letter which when I had opened I found from an Unknown who stiled himself my Friend and gave me this Advice that a Lady of good CountryQuality and Fortune and who was then in  Exeter  was going to be disposed of by her Mother to a Man she no way affected But that she had been heard to say  If the handsome  Switzer  were in his Place she should obey without Reluctancy  And concluded the Letter with giving me Advice like a good Friend to improve my growing Fortune for so considerable an one as Twelve Thousand Pounds was not every Day thrown into a Soldier's Lap I had forgot to tell your Ladyship the Letter was writ in  French  the Lady's Name and Directions to her Lodgings My Heart gave me a secret Presage that the Matter would not be lucky to me which I followed and therefore took no Notice of the Letter Three Days after the same old Woman brought me another much more pressing Upon which I gave myself blindly up to my Destiny I visited and found  the Lady tho' not a Beauty yet genteel and taking It was easy to guess by my Reception that the Letters came from her I will omit the Discourse we had and only rest upon Matter of Fact She obliged me to leave my Command and go with her to her Estate Her Mother looked upon me with an evil Eye but my Mistress was transportingly kind and much concerned that none of the Ministers round durst marry us for fear of the old Lady Whereupon we concluded I should pretend to take my Leave as desingning for  London  but instead of that go directly into  Cornwall  where she had a considerable Estate and would meet me The Matter happened as we agreed but for fear her Mother should pursue us she consented to  take me for her Husband  before the Parson could be got to make us  such  That happy Night I had all the Reason in the World to believe myself agreeable to her and all was confirmed in the Morning by the Priest Thus caressed and blessed we returned to her House The old Lady who had no Command of her Daughter's Fortune and saw the Business beyond Remedy was one of the first to make her Court to me and wish me Joy Three happy Months I had all the Satisfaction that innocent Marriage and excessive Love in a Bride could give me Then I began  to consider a little my Affairs and proposed to my Wife my being naturalized that I might look after hers She swooned at the Name and when she recovered she snatched a Bayonet of mine and wounded herself under the Left Breast but not much I cannot express my Surprize We hushed the Matter for fear of her Mother and I employed some of my Soldiery Skill to cure it which had the Effect I enquired into the Reason of this Extravagancy She told me the Discovery of  Interest  in me when she had believed  Love  was the only Motive of our  Marriage  Some Days passed and as often as I offered at it she received such mighty Disgust that I resolved to get it done without her Notice for she took me not as a Husband but a Lover It was true I was received as a Guest but not a Master and my Circumstance having left my Command required that I got her Leave for my Journey She shewed such extravagant Passion at our Separation that I swore a speedy Return and resolved to leave my Naturalization depending look after my other Affairs and return within a Fortnight to her But before that Time I had a dangerous Fit of Sickness at  London  I wrote often to her and gave her an Account that the  Act was passed  and I could now happily call myself an  English  Husband She only answered She knew how to interpret it but she was out in her Cunning if I should find an  English  Wife at my Service who knew not the true Value and Use of one This Letter damped me but trusting to the Greatness of that Power Love had given me in her Heart I did not question but my Presence would make all Things easy I took Post my Impatience would not stay the Coach tho' the Remains of my Fever seemed to expect it I gave myself no Rest during the whole Journey I sent to give her Notice of my Arrival but what was my Surprize to find all shut at home I called under her Window where I perceived Light It was a heavy Night of Rain I knocked at the Gates and stormed but all to no Purpose I was glad to take up my Lodging in the Porch At Six in the Morning an UnderServant appeared I asked for her Lady She told me she was gone none knew whether and had conveyed away her Plate  c  so that if I pleased an empty House was at my Service I calmly bore all this imagining it but a Tryal sought her round the Country but in vain she often shifted Places and went disguised Not long after she commenced a  Process  against me and by a Pretence which will for ever make her notorious  rendered me to the Court as  Incapable  I was still so tender of her Fame as to suffer the Aspersion Common Law separted us She got the better by my refusing to vindicate myself and I Fifteen Hundred Pounds of her Fortune and the Charges of the Court It is since last  August  that this has happened I have vainly tried to remove her implacable Aversion or to learn the Cause of it But I see my Endeavours are all fruitless and I am now going to leave  England  I think for ever  I complimented him upon his Misfortunes and really in my Opinion he could not be deserving of them 'Gad Madam  says  Beau see what inconstant Things you Ladies are I happened to be at this Gentleman's House when he was first married and never saw any thing so fond of him as his Wife 'Gad I do not believe whatever Woman I make happy tho' her Esteem be equal to my Merit she can possibly be fonder  I am now got safely weary into  Exeter  and I thank God rid of the Impertinency of my FellowTravellers  Beau  excepted who will see me safe home tho' distant from his The Cathedral here is very fine the Bishop's Seat in it surpasses  Salisbury  tho' short in every thing  else Forgive me for leaving you thus abruptly since it is more pleasingly to entertain myself with a Letter of yours just brought to me  I am Most Constantly and Sincerely yours DM  Exeter  June  LETTER VII  IF I have omitted answering your Three last it proceeded from nothing but the Desire of doing something new and you know it is extremely so in me not eagerly to shew you all Testimonies of Friendship My Solitude is much more pleasing than I fancied it As yet I am not weary of that happy Indifferency which leaves me nothing either to hope or fear  Thus Empty and thus Idle do I live  Nor Lov'd nor Loving can nor take nor give  I have most foppish Letters from  Beau  who parted with a World of seeming Regret and yet I hear he is endeavouring at a Mistress I suppose I may bid his Impertinence farewel for ever I think I bid you hope in one of mine to hear no more of him I know not how I am fallen upon the nauseous Repetition  Themistocles  refused  Simonides  when he would have taught  him the  Art  of  Memory  pertinently saying  He had more need of  Forgetfulness  than  Memory  I  remember  what I would  not  but I cannot  forget  what I  would My Study has fallen upon Religion I am searching into all Sorts You shall not fail to hear what that ChanceMedley produces I can now with cold Indifferency shake Hands with all Things beyond this Solitude How long the extraordinary Humour may last I cannot inform you At present I repeat with Stoical Pride  Keep Me ye Bounteous Gods my Cave and Wood  In Peace Let Tares and Acorns be my Food  Yours c DM  July  LETTER VIII  I Am sorry I cannot make good my Promise to so indearing a Friend as yourself Looking over my Papers I find but one of Colonel PACK's Letters in Imitation of the  Portugal  NUN's I certainly had  Three  which he sent to me for my Opinion but  Two  are lost which I very much regret and the more because I know not where he is to repair it I would hear how you approve his Stile I think  Imitation  the hardest Part of Writing It confines a freeborn Genius which naturally loves untrod Wilds at least if I may guess at another's by my own And now I am speaking of that let me tell you all those romantic Ideas of  Retirement  which viewed at a Distance give a ravishing Prospect now I am wedded and bedded to prove the worst sort of  Matrimony  but it is only to such a particular Friend as yourself that I dare complain to the remoter Sort I assume a Stoical Appetite and AirTell them  The World with all its gaudy Pleasures are but rich Delusions which at once corrupt  our Senses and our Fame That the little Spot of Earth I have chose to fix my Fate in has more solid Entertainments more real innate Delights than the Glories of a Court  Then sigh and seem to pity the more elevated Part of the World that can bury themselves in Noise and Crowd But let me tell you there is no real Satisfaction without  Conversation  I have had so much of the  Dead  since I settled here and as I may say nothing of the  Living  for I find none deserves the  Name  that I wish for the conjuring Art and would rather converse with the Ghosts of the Departed than always with their Books or with myself But I forget I detain you from better Company I mean the inclosed Write to me still but nothing of News I desire to hear none till I see  London  again and when that will be I have not the Pleasure so much as to imagine It will be new to lie  forgotten  and  forgetting  and as it were be born with Understanding to all the Vanities and Virtues if any of that  Hydra  I am Sir Withgreat Esteem Your Most Obedient Servant DM  March  PS  I inclose Colonel  Pack  's Imitation of the Nun's Love Letters to a Cavalier  A LETTER FROM A NUN in  Portugal  TO A GENTLEMAN in  France  OH my  fled Heart  and he that so unjustly keeps it from me Was not your barbarous Resolution sufficient that I should never possess  Yours  but you must add the Use of all your best Art to keep me from my  Own  In what Disorder do I speak and write for want of  a poor tender Heart  That is gone a Pilgrimage to Love and the unkind Heavens not hearing its Prayer has thro' Distraction lost its Way and never will return again Fire fets on  Fire Why then does not my Flame make you burn It is a false Maxim  Extremity of Cold scorches  Had I at first put on a Behaviour more cool and remote to your pretended Affection and treated you with Unkindness how many Bows and Vows would you have offered at  Love'sAltar  With what Ardency would you have continued your Protestations Who would have thought that a Fire at first so well kindled as yours should need Fanning with an infectious Blast to preserve its Heat Or that the wholsome Sun should put it out But that alas was my Misfortune My Burning was the greater and drew yours awayHow can I then with any Confidence blame you for what I myself was truly and principally the Occasion of You too easily perceived how earnestly I was wont to watch your Eyes that they looked not on others as if mine took it unkindly they were not gazed on altogether How perverse are our Fates Why else was it not contrived that you might be as happy in me as it was possible for me to be in you Say what you will you was to blame What Care you took to assault my Affections was sufficiently discoverable in the constant Ardour and Formality of your Approaches contriving to appear at all Times as engaging as possible  Your Conquest was not so great You could not well have met with a Heart less fortified for a Defence Ye Gods that I should yield upon your very  first Summons  and so dishonourably that I was not allowed  Flying Colours  Nay what is yet more that I should bear so mean so low and so contemptible a Spirit as to take infinitely more Delight in my own Captivity and Vassallage than in the most flourishing Tranquillity What do I thus rave upon What would I have If I am happy in my Condition why do I not rest and retain my Senses like others of my Sex But that still and I fear ever I have the same sad Tune to sing  My Conqueror whom I adored for being so is gone and my Cloyster is now as much a Prison to me as it was Heaven and Liberty and all Things when I had him there It was an unworthy Thing to steal my better Part my Soul away and not think this little Frame its old Companion worth taking with you But what you had got you thought was of light Carriage needed little Stowage paid no Freight and I dare stake my Life was the All you ever intended to have of me And to be so served is it seems the All I am ever likely to expect from you How grosly did I flatter myself and abuse you  whenever I imagined you would be kind and true to me You that are so cruel that could you reduce any other Woman into my ill Circumstances if there was a Third in the World you would certainly leave the former and there feign fresh Adorations If there was not yet purely to gratify your Inhumanity to her even I now slighted and neglected should then have your Company for you could not brook being put by a Pleasure of that Kind though it cost you the Trouble of going to one who loved you more than the World  How very odd and as tho' you were writing to some public Place of Intelligence was that  Discourse  of yours in your last Letter  concerning the great Lightning and Thunder which you say happened in your Parts  Also  you desire to know what Weather we have had here  Are these proper Enquiries for a LoveLetter Truly it might have  Thundered Lightened  and  Rained  or it might have been very  pleasant delightful Weather  for aught I know for I am not capable of making any Remarks of that kind But this I can inform you being too sure of the Truth of it that it has been very  stormy Weather  in my  Eyes  ever since your Departure and until you return the only  Sun  whose Influence  can disperse these  Clouds  I fear it will ever be  Tempestuous  This Account it may be pleases you more than if I had sent you Word the ill  Weather  had reached our Country demolished our Monastery set me at Liberty and I was in Pursuit of you Then then how I would glut my Revenge by the Incursions of my Love For it should hunt you in all Places and all Countries And since it wore so much the Visage of an evil Spirit in your Conceit here as to make you quit the Spot I would try whether Change of Air would alter its Complection and Features so as to force you into a better Opinion of it and be thoroughly revenged on you that Way For  to love  I find is the Unhappiness you would avoid above all other things But your Appetite and Taste is as much depraved as my Project is vain and impracticable I find the Sour of  France  gratifies your Palate above the Sweets of  Portugal  and a  French  LADY with her distant Regards to your Address and at last counterfeit artificial Acceptance shall engage you much more than the Loyalty Integrity Truth and Freedom of my unlimited Passion Will not the World swear we are both mad You for preferring a Counterfeit because it glisters before the true Metal itself which is known to every  Child by its Weight I for my Fidelity to so much Ingratitude But let the World blame us as it pleases I am resolved to be as true to you as you to your natural Inconstancy To what a Degree of Bliss should I be advanced if I could find you complaining of the Remissness of my Love and admiring the Intenseness of your own Then I should be but too happy if that Fault was not found on your Side as alas to all the World too visibly it is And the same Conceptions you make of an Immensity will but just serve you to fathom my Zeal which although cherished and pruned after the most careful Manner is productive of nothing but the most bitter sour and unpleasant Fruits imaginableYour unkind Dealings and Actions to me are the Fruits of my extraordinary Passion What Soul could imagine such dissonant Notes should strike to interrupt the Harmony of my Affection In what had you been the worse had you retaliated my extream Kindness with but a little of yours and although more than a little be my Due yet with the least Grain I could have wrought my own Contentment But you are so unjust to deny all and leave me to a racking and a miserable Despair one Hour's Torment of which I would not wish you should endure Ages to come to  be set free myself and yet no otherwise fond of my Condition but as it is a Gift of yours and which for any Thing less than your Love I will never part with O barbarous barbarous Man to deny me that which you take more Pains to throw away upon another than I can do to obtain it You shall not use me thus indeed you must not It is I say it but you regard not that so insensible are you of my Condition which though never so unfortunate as to my own particular yet is aggravated with Cares for your Welfare who are the sole Cause of my Unhappiness How you will relish this  Letter  I know not I fear you will think there are too many Invectives against your Tyranny in which I will agree with you myself and ask your Forgiveness But alas they are as gentle as I could possibly persuade my Pen to drop for since you take so much Pleasure in a hard Heart I would not for the World any ways cross you by making you less obdurate so tenderly I value your Satisfaction and so little for your sake my own But oh the infinite Pleasures you would find in  Love  if you thought them worth the looking after  Love  as it is or is not mutual is the truest Epitome of the supernatural States If mutual the Joys are lasting and never cloy if not the Torments  are intolerable yet must be endured Oh that any thing I could say might dissolve you to a Sense of my miserable Life or indeed rather your own And yet if it could in the least enter into my Thoughts that you are altogether at Repose I assure you I would never interrupt you no Noise of my Afflictions should ever be your Disturbance But I am very much mistaken if you are altogether without Remorse for the Sufferings you have brought upon me I remember you once was flexible and of a compassionate Nature and your Behaviour very like a Gentleman whatever has misguided you to the Abuse of my Favours which if I have Knowledge of my Heart were at first much more for your sake than my own you were the Aggressor and not I and whatever Kindness I shewed you was more to make me happy than yourself that by Charity to a Serpent I at last was stung It is said that venomous Creatures have a balsamick Quality in themselves to cure the Wounds they make But you more unnatural than all the rest have none at least most cruelly you withhold it from me Oh Heaven that I had but Power to contain myself that I had but Temper to be a little calm But it is a Condition I have long since abandoned and till I see you again will never reassume  In the Rage I am in I could think in you as many Unkindnesses as by and by the Fury of Love would find a Task to unravel for if one Half Hour I blame you in the next I call it Injustice So careful am I that no ill Thought of you appear deserving that were you worse than you are my Pleasure would consist in being flattered that you are better than I think you Nay sometimes I persuade myself that you are a Man of the greatest Justice in the World and that it is not even in your Nature wilfully to do an unequal Thing But it is most certain I am doomed to a fruitless Love without the least Possibility of a Deliverance Indeed formerly I had a faint Prospect as I thought of being in some measure restored but I looked through false Opticks that presented me with a wrong Object and since that I have done the great Work of learning to be well satisfied with my intolerable Condition Did my Love run parallel with what is commonly found in the World it would not be so desperateHappy they who in a Pet or upon some small Disgust can recede from their Passions and set up for new Ones elsewhere and whatever they pretend SelfInterest is the greatest Thing This is the Way of Amouring most in Fashion This is that  Imposture which prevails upon so many tender Hearts And in Cases of Denial very artificially can usurp languishing Eyes want no expressive Insinuations counterfeit Melancholy and Distraction and all to serve some base ByeEnd If this had been the Quality of my Love the Vengeance you assign me had then been merited I verily believe if it had had but the least Tincture of Treachery I should have won your Heart should have made you jealous And that Temper would have been very inconsistent with your Resolutions to make a thorough Conquest Nothing less than which to a Man of Prowess like you could have been a real Pleasure Yes yes it is very plain if my Passion had been forged and bore a false Accent it would certainly much better have agreed with yours as being much nearer related but the fatal Consequence of a true Fervency returned with fair Assurances and foul Actions none knows but the wretched solitary I Upon the whole I think verily I love you because you make me miserable If that be true go on be signalized to the World for your Unkindness that the more I may be so for my unaccountable Affection That I love you Heaven knows you know else I should see you here again cringing out the feigned  Allegations of your Sincerity though much more distant than we are O that we were to begin again What Course would I then take I fear even fool myself as I have done for since I know no greater Pleasure than the Love of you I should too willingly run the Risque of any Disadvantage that could happen by it I die a thousand Deaths every Hour and still revive to die them over again Adieu What could I not endure for your sake I have at this Moment so lively an  Idea  of you that I almost fancy you here in Person Methinks how very kind you are How affectionately you condole me for the Torments I have suffered in your Absence and how thankful I am to you for them How you press my Hand and swear you will never part with me And Ah  Monsieur  How I believe you for being hitherto so faithfulOnce more Adieu I think I never writ Letters to you in my Life but their Length made them stayed for The Post at my Request has waited a great while and I am now sent to I wonder else when I should give over You may judge a little of my Condition when you see even hurryingPosthaste itself can admit of a Delay to please me The Actions of all People that see me are designedly kind and of a Desire to divert me One takes  me by the Hand begging of me to be chearful and leave my unprofitable Thinking shewing me good Reason for it But alas I find  Reason  and  Love  two very separate Things not at all influencing each other Today a  Sister  brought me Variety of the best Fruits of which nothing but a Piece of a  Pomgranate  could I be persuaded to eat I might thank her but I am not sure I had so much Manners Every body excuses my ill Breeding but much wonder at my Alteration The Rigour and Severity of our Religion can dispense with many great Faults in me that it will not allow in others What shall I do Well I have only one Thing more besides a Thousand to say to you which is That if you can have Regard for any  one  Sentence in this long Letter it may be to  this  last  I implore you to let me see you in  Portugal  before I die  Adieu Adieu  SOPHIA  portrait of George Granville Lord Lansdowne  The Right Honourable GEORGE Lord LANSDOWNE  M  Gucht sculp  LETTERS Of the HONOURABLE GEORGE GRANVILLE  Esq  To the Hon Mr BERNARD GRANVILLE at the Earl of  Bathe  's  St James  's  Mar near Doncaster  Oct  SIR  _YOUR having no Prospect of obtaining a Commission for me can no way alter or cool my Desire at this important Juncture to venture my Life in some Manner or other for my King and my Country  I cannot bear living under the Reproach of lying obscure and idle in a Country Retirement  when every Man who has the least Sense of Honour should be preparing for the Field  You may remember Sir with what Reluctance I submitted to your Commands upon  Monmouth  's Rebellion when no Importunity could prevail with you to permit me to leave the Academy I was too young to be hazarded but give me Leave to say it is glorious at any Age to die for one's Country and the sooner the nobler the Sacrifice  I am now older by three Years my Uncle  Bathe  was not so old when he was left among the Slain at the Battle of  Newbury  Nor you yourself Sir when you make your Escape from your Tutors to join your Brother at the Defence of  Scilly  The same Cause is now come round about again The King has been misled let those who have misled him be answerable for it Nobody can deny but he is Sacred in his own Person and it is every honest Man's Duty to defend it  You are pleas'd to say it is yet doubtful if the  Hollanders  are rash enough to make such an Attempt But be that as it will I beg Leave to insist upon it that I may be presented to his Majesty as one whose utmost Ambition it is to devote  his Life to his Service and my Country's after the Example of all my Ancestors  The Gentry assembled at  York  to agree upon the Choice of Representatives for the County have prepared an Address to assure his Majesty they are ready to sacrifice their Lives and Fortunes for him upon this and all other Occasions but at the same Time they humbly beseech him to give them such Magistrates as may be agreeable to the Laws of the Land for at present there is no Authority to which they can legally submit  They have been beating for Volunteers at  York  and the Towns adjacent to supply the Regiments at  Hull  but nobody will list  By what I can hear every body wishes well to the King but they would be glad his Ministers were hang'd  The Winds continue so contrary that no Landing can be so soon as was apprehended therefore I may hope with your Leave and Assistance to be in Readiness before any Action can begin  I beseech you Sir most humbly and most earnestly to add this one Act of Indulgence more to so many other Testimonies which I have constantly received  of your Goodness and be pleas'd to believe me always with the utmost Duty and Submission Sir  Your most Dutiful Son and Most Obedient Servant GEORGE GRANVILLE  NB  The above Letter was wrote before his Lordship was Years old  TO WILLIAMHENRY Earl of  Bathe  c  At the Camp in Flanders  Sept  My Dear Lord  WHILST you are pursuing Honour in the Field in the earliest Time of your Life after the Example of your Ancestors I am commanded by the Queen to let you know she has declared you her LordLieutenant of the County of  Cornwall  the Earl of  Rochester  to act for you till you are of Age  You will do well to write your most humble Thanks to her Majesty for so graciously remembring you unsollicited in your Absence You should likewise do the same to my Lord  Rochester  for accepting the Trouble  This my dear Lord is a Preparative to bring you upon the Stage with some Lustre at your first Appearance in the World You  are placed at the Head of a Body of Gentry entirely dispos'd in Affection to you and your Family You are born possess'd of all those amiable Qualities which cannot fail of fixing their Hearts You have no other Example to follow but to tread in the Steps of your Ancestors It is all that is hoped or desired from you  You are upon an uncommon Foundation in that Part of the World Your Ancestors for at least five hundred Years never made any Alliance Male or Female out of the  Western  Counties Thus there is hardly a Gentleman either in  Cornwall  or  Devon  but has some of your Blood or you some of theirs I remember the first Time I accompany'd your Grandfather into the  West  upon holding his Parliament of  Tinners  as Warden of the  Stannaries  when there was the most numerous Appearance of Gentry of both Counties that had ever been remember'd together I observ'd there was hardly any one but whom he call'd  Cousin  and I could not but observe at the same Time how well they were pleased with it Let this be a Lesson for you when it comes to your Turn to appear amongst them Nothing is more obliging than to seem to retain the Memory of Kindred and Alliances tho' never so remote And by Consequence nothing more disobliging than a  Forgetfulness of them which is always imputed to an affected disdainful Superiority and Pride  There is another Particular in my Opinion of no small Consequence to the Support of your Interest which I would recommend to your Imitation and that is to make  Stowe  your principal Residence I have heard your Grandfather say if ever he liv'd to be possess'd of  NewHall  he would pull it down that your Father might have no Temptation to withdraw from the ancient Seat of his Family From the  Conquest  to the  Restauration  your Ancestors constantly resided amongst their Countrymen except when the public Service call'd upon them to sacrifice their Lives for it  Stowe  in my Grandfather's Time till the Civil Wars broke out was a Kind of Academy for all the young Men of Family in the Country He provided himself with the best Masters of all Kinds for Education and the Children of his Neighbours and Friends shared the Advantage with his own Thus he in a Manner became the Father of his Country and not only engaged the Affection of the present Generation but laid a Foundation of Friendship for Posterity which is not worn out at this Day  Upon this Foundation my Lord you inherit Friends without the Trouble of makeing them and have only to preserve them an easy Task for you to whom Nature has been so liberal of every Quality necessary to attract Affection and gain the Heart  I must tell you the Generality of our Countrymen have been always  Royalists  you inherit too much Loyal Blood to like them the worse There is an old Saying amongst them That a  Godolphin  was never known to want Wit a  Trelawney  Courage or a  Granville  Loyalty Wit and Courage are not to be mistaken and to give those Families their Due they still keep up to their Character But it is the Misfortune of Loyalty not to be so clearly understood or defined In a Country subject to Revolutions what passes for Loyalty Today may be Treason Tomorrow but I make great Difference between Real and Nominal Treason In the Quarrel of the Houses of  York  and  Lancaster  both Sides were proclaimed Traitors as the other prevailed Even under  Cromwell  's Usurpation all who adhered to the King were proclaimed Traitors and suffered as such but this makes no Alteration in the Thing itself It may be enacted Treason to call black black or white white But black will  be black and white will be white in Spite of all the Legislators in the World  There can be no Doubt about Allegiance unless Princes become Tyrants and then they cease to be Kings They will no longer be respected as God's Vicegerents who violate the Laws they were sworn to protect The Preacher may tell us of passive Obedience that Tyrants are to be patiently suffer'd as Scourges in the Hands of a righteous God to chastise a sinful Nation and to be submitted to like Plagues Famines and such like Judgments from above Such Doctrine were it true could only serve to mislead illjudging Princes into a false Security Men are not to be reason'd out of their Senses Human Nature and SelfPreservation will eternally arm against Slavery and Oppression  It is therefore not to be supposed that even the weakest Prince would run that Hazard unless seduced by Advice wickedly palliated by evil Counsellors  Nero  himself under the Influence of a good Ministry was the mildest the most gracious and best beloved of the Emperors The most sanguinary the most profligate and the most abhorr'd under a bad one A Prince may be deceiv'd or mistaken in the Choice of his Favourites but he has this  Advantage he is sure to hear of it from the Voice of the Public if then he is deaf he seems to take upon himself the Blame and Odium of those Actions which were chargeable before but upon his Advisers  Idle Murmurs groundless Discontents and pretended Jealousies and Fears the Effect of private Prejudice and Resentments have been and will ever be under the wisest Administrations We are pester'd with them even now when we have a  Queen  who is known to have nothing so much at Heart as the Contentment of her People These are transitory Vapours which scatter at the first Appearance of Light The Infection spreads no farther than a particular Set of four splenetic  Enthusiasts  in Politics not worth minding or correcting Universal Discontent can never happen but from solid Provocations  Many wellmeaning Persons however abounding in Zeal have been often unwarily caught by popular Pretences and not undeceived till it was too late Have a Care my dear Cousin of splitting upon that Rock There have been  false Patriots  as well as  false Prophets  To  Fear God and Honour the King  were Injunctions so closely tack'd together that they seem to make but one and the same Command A Man may as well pretend  to be a good Christian without fearing God as a good Subject without honouring the King  Deo Patrice Amicis  was your GreatGrandfather Sir  Bevil  's Motto In three Words he has added to his Example a Rule which in following you can never err in any Duty of Life The brightest Carriage and the gentlest Disposition is Part of the Lord  Clarendon  's Character of him so much of him you may have begun to shew us already and the best Wish I can make for you is to resemble him as much in allbut his untimely Fate  My Dear Lord  I am for ever c GEORGE GRANVILLE  TO WILLIAMHENRY Earl of  Bathe  At the Camp in Flanders  EVery living Creature my dear Lord is entitled to Offices of Humanity The Distress even of an Enemy should reconcile us to him If he thirsts give him Drink if he hungers give him Food overcome Evil with Good It is with this Disposition I would have you enter into the Exercise of that Authority  LordLieutenant of  Cornwall with which her Majesty has honoured you over your Countrymen Let no body inspire you with PartyPrejudices and Resentments Let it be your Business to reconcile Differences and heal Divisions and to restore if possible Harmony and good Neighbourhood amongst them If then there should be any left to wish you ill make them asham'd and confounded with your Goodness and Moderation  Not that I would ever advise you to sacrifice one Hair of the Head of an old Friend to your Family to gain fifty new ones but if you can encrease the Number by Curtesy and Moderation it may be worth the Trial  Believe me my dear Lord Humanity and Generosity make the best Foundation to build a Character upon A Man may have Birth and Riches and Power Wit Learning Courage but without Generosity it is impossible to be a great Man Whatever the Rich and Powerful may think of themselves whatever Value they may set upon their Abundance and Grandeur they will find themselves but the more hated and despis'd for the ill Use they make of it  You should look upon yourselves but as Stewards and Trustees for the Distressed Your Overabundance is but a Deposit for the Use and Relief of the Unhappy you are answerable for all Superfluities mispent It is not to be supposed that Providence would have made such Distinctions among Men such unequal Distributions but that they might endear themselves to one another by mutual Helps and Obligations  Gratitude  is the surest Cement of Love Friendship and Society  There are indeed Rules to be observ'd and Measures to be kept in the Distribution of Favours We know who have both the Power and Inclination to do Good but for Want of Judgment in the Direction they pass only for goodnatur'd Fools instead of generous Benefactors  My Lordwill grudge a Guinea to an honest Gentleman in Distress but readily give twenty to a common Strumper Another shall resuse to lend fifty Pounds to his best Friend without sufficient Security and the next Moment set his whole Fortune upon a Card or a Die a Chance for which he can have no Security My Lordis to be seen every Day at a ToyShop squandring away his Money in Trinkets and Baubles and at the same Time leaves his Brothers and Sisters without common Necessaries  Generosity does not consist in a Contempt of Money in throwing it away at Random without Judgment or Distinction tho' that indeed is better than locking it up for Multitudes have the Benefit of it but in a right Disposition to proper Objects in Proportion to the Merit the Circumstances the Rank and Condition of those who stand in Need of our Service  Princes are more exposed than any others to the misplacing their Favours Merit is  ever modest and keeps its Distance The Forward and Importunate stand always nearest in Sight and are not to be put out of Countenance nor thrust out of the Way  I remember to have heard a Saying of the late King  James That be never knew a modest Man make his Way in a Court David Floyd  whom you know being then in waiting at his Majesty's Elbow reply'd bluntly  Pray Sir whose Fault's that  The King stood corrected and was silent If Princes could see with their own Eyes and hear with their own Ears what a happy Situation it would be both for themselves and their Subjects To reward Merit to redress the Injured to relieve the Oppressed to raise the Modest to humble the Insolent what a Godlike Prerogative were a right Use made of it  How happy are you my dear Lord who are born with such generous Inclinations with Judgment to direct them and the Means to indulge them Of all Men most miserable is he who has the Inclination without the Means To meet with a deserving Object of Compassion without having the Power to give Relief of all the Circumstances in Life is the most disagreeable To have the Power is the greatest Pleasure  Methinks I see you ready to cry out  Good Cousin why this Discourse to me What Occasion have I for these Lectures  None at all my dear Lord I am only making my Court to you by letting you see I think as you do  But one Word more and I have done  In Trust Intimacy and Confidence be as particular as you please In Humanity Charity and Benevolence universal  I am for ever c GEORGE GRANVILLE  To my Nephew Mr BEVIL GRANVILLE Upon his entring into Holy Orders  WHEN I look upon the Date of your last Letter I must own myself blameable for not having sooner return'd you my Thanks for it  I approve very well of your Resolution of dedicating yourself to the Service of God you could not chuse a better Master provided you have so sufficiently search'd your Heart as to be persuaded you can serve him well In so doing you may secure to yourself many Blessings in this World as well as a sure Expectation in the next There is one thing which I perceive you have not thoroughly purg'd yourself from which is Flattery You have bestow'd so much of that upon me in your Letter that I hope you have no more left and that you meant it only to take your Leave of such Flights of Fancy which however well meant oftener put a Man out of Countenance than oblige him  You are now become a Searcher after Truth I shall hereafter take it more kindly to be justly reprov'd by you than to be undeservedly complimented  I would not have you understand me as if I recommended to you a sour Presbyterian Severity that is yet more to be avoided Advice like Physick should be so sweeten'd and prepar'd as to be made palatable or Nature may be apt to revolt against it Be always sincere but at the same Time always polite Be humble without descending from your Character reprove and correct without offending good Manners To be a Cynick is as bad as to be a Sycophant You are not to lay aside the Gentleman with your Sword nor to put on the Gown to hide your Birth and good Breeding but to adorn it Such has been the Malice of the World from the Beginning that Pride Avarice and Ambition have been charg'd upon the Priesthood in all Ages in all Countries and in all Religions What they are most oblig'd to combat against in their Pulpits they are most accus'd of encouraging in their Conduct It behoves you therefore to be more upon your Guard in this than in any other Profession Let your Example confirm your Doctrine and let no Man ever have it in  his Power to reproach you with practising contrary to what you preach  You had an Uncle Dr  Dennis Granville  Dean of  Durham  whose Memory I shall ever revere make him your Example Sanctity sate so easy so unaffected and so graceful upon him that in him we beheld the very Beauty of Holiness He was as chearful as familiar and condescending in his Conversation as he was strict regular and exemplary in his Piety As well bred and accomplish'd as a Courtier as reverend and venerable as an Apostle He was indeed in every Thing apostolical for he abandon'd all to follow his Lord and Master  May you resemble him may he revive in you may his Spirit descend upon you as  Elijah  's upon  Elisha  and may the great God of Heaven in guiding directing and strengthening your pious Resolutions pour down his best and choicest Blessings upon you  You shall ever find me dear Nephew your most affectionate Uncle and sincere Friend  c  LANSDOWNE  TO The QUEEN  These Verses were written by his Lordship in the blank Leaf of a Copy of his Works in  to  presented to her Majesty He died  Anno    MY MUSE

_THE Perusal of this DIALOGUE in DEFENCE of the FAIR SEX written by a GENTLEMAN of my Acquaintance much surprized me For it was not easy for me to imagine that one so young could have treated so nice a Subject with so much Judgment It is true I was not ignorant that he was naturally ingenious and that he had improved himself by Travelling and from thence I might reasonably have expected  that Air of Gallantry which is so visibly diffused thro' the Body of the Work and is indeed the Soul that animates all Things of this Nature But so much Variety of Reading both in ancient and modern Authors such Digestion of that Reading so much Justness of Thought that it leaves no Room for Affectation or Pedantry I may venture to say are not overcommon amongst practised Writers and very rarely to be found amongst Beginners It puts me in Mind of what was said of Mr  Waller  the Father of our  English  Numbers upon the Sight of his first Verses by the Wits of the last Age that  he came out into the World Forty Thousand strong before they had heard of him  Here in Imitation of my Friend's Apostrophes I hope the Reader need not be told that Mr  Waller  is only mentioned for Honour's sake that I am desirous  of laying hold on his Memory on all Occasions and thereby acknowledging to the World that unless he  had  written none of us  could  write I know my Friend will forgive me this Digression for it is not only a Copy of his Stile but of his Candour The Reader will observe that he is ready for all Hints of commending Merit and the Writers of this Age and Country are particularly obliged to him for his pointing out those Passages which the  French  call  Beaux Endroits  wherein they have most excelled And tho' I may seem in this to have my own Interest in View because he has more than once mentioned me so much to my Advantage yet I hope the Reader will take it only for a  Parenthesis  because the Piece would have been very perfect without it I may be suffered to please myself with the Kindness of my Friend  without valuing myself upon his Partiality He had not Confidence enough to send it out into the World without my Opinion of it that it might pass securely at least amongst the fair Readers for whose Service it was principally designed I am not so presuming to think my Opinion can either be his Touchstone or his Passport But I thought I might send him back to  Ariosto  who has made it the Business of almost Thirty  Stanzas  in the Beginning of the th Book of his  Orlando Furioso  not only to praise that beautiful part of the Creation but also to make a sharp Satire on their Enemies to give Mankind their own and to tell them plainly that from their Envy it proceeds that the Virtue and great Actions of Women are purposely concealed and the Failings of some few amongst them exposed with all the aggravating Circumstances  of Malice For my own Part who have always been their Servant and have never drawn my Pen against them I had rather see some of them praised extraordinarily than any of them suffer by Detraction And that in this Age and at this Time particularly wherein I find more  Heroines  than  Heroes  Let me therefore give them Joy of their new Champion If any will think me more partial to him than really I am they can only say I have returned his Bribe And the worst I wish him is that he may receive  Justice  from the  Men  and  Favour  only from the  Ladies  JOHN DRYDEN    SOME ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM WALSH  Esq  THE AUTHOR of the following excellent Treatise was  "  Athen Oxon  Vol II pag Edit ult  William Walsh  Esq  Son of  Joseph Walsh  of  Abberley  in  Worcestershire  He became a GentlemanCommoner of  WadhamCollege Oxford  in  EasterTerm  aged Years left it without a Degree retired to his native Country and sometimes to

Gallant  "  Mr  Wood  will have it that the LADY characterized by Mr  Walsh  under the Name of EUGENIA was his Mistress For this he could not have any other ground than his own malevolent Conjecture But that our Author was a Gentleman very susceptable of the  soft Passion  appears plainly from his own Pen sending forth his  LoveLetters  and  Poems  with the following  Address  to the Public  Go

Torments free  May find the Thing they never felt by Me  Perhaps advis'd avoid the gilded Bait  And warn'd by my Example shun my Fate  While with calm Joy safe landed on the Coast  I view the Waves on which I once was tost  Love is a Medley of Endearments Jars  Suspicions Quarrels Reconcilements Wars  Then Peace again O wou'd it not be best  To chace the fatal Poison from our Breast  But since so few can live from Passion free  Happy the Man and only happy he  Who with such lucky Stars begins his Love  That his cool Judgment does his Choice approve  Ill grounded Passions quickly wear away  What's built upon Esteem can ne'er decay  As for  three  Amours I have had in my Lifetime says Mr  Walsh  See his xxth  Letter  to a  Friend  I valued the  one  Mistress after I left loving her I loved  another  after I left valuing her I love and value the  third  after having lost all Hopes of her So that methinks according to the Course of my Passions I ought to love and value the next after having obtained her However from this time forward upon what Follies soever you fall be pleased for my sake to spare those of Love being very well satisfied there is not one Folly of that kind except Marriage which I have not already committed I have been without Railery in Love with the Beauty of a Woman whom I have never seen with the Wit of one whom I never heard speak nor seen any thing that she has written and with the heroic Virtues of a Woman without knowing any one Action of her Life that could make me think she had any  Cupid  will have it so and what can weak Mortals do against so potent a God Adieu live pleasantly that is  philosophically  and guard your  Heart  from the  Pains of Love  Such were the Sentiments of our Author when about Thirty Years of Age  Mr  Walsh  pursued the Advice he gave his Friend and left  Cupid  in the Lurch wholly gave himself up to a  Literatum Otium  became one of the best of Subjects to his Soveraign King WILLIAM whom he has immortalized in his inimitable Version of that  Ode  of  Horace  begininng  Justum Tenacem propositi virum  c  And his immortal Successor Queen ANNE constituted Mr  Walsh  her Master of the Horse  This Gentleman was in the Opinion of Mr DRYDEN  See his  Postscript  to his Translat of  Virgil    "  the best Critic of our Nation in his time  "  And Mr  Pope  speaking of the Earl of  Roscomon  thus concludes his  Essay  on  Criticism  viz  To him the Wit of  Greece  and  Rome  was known  And ev'ry Author's Merit but his own  Such late was  Walsh  the Muse's Judge and Friend  Who justly knew to Blame or to Commend  To Failings mild but zealous for Desert  The clearest Head and the sincerest Heart  In the Year the Public were obliged with a small Posthumous Piece of Mr  Walsh  's intitled AESCULAPIUS Or  The Hospital of  FOOLS An Imitation of LUCIAN hereunto subjoined  A DEFENCE OF THE FAIR SEX  To EUGENIA  _IT is a dangerous thing MADAM it must be confessed this Conversing with fair Ladies and it draws us into Inconveniencies of which we do not at first see the Consequences I little thought when I talked with your Ladyship of the Virtues of your Sex that you would have commanded me to have given my Sentiments upon that Subject in Writing I grant you  Madam  you might have spoken  to several of your Acquaintance who would have undertaken the Business at first Word with all the Courage imaginable but to me who never durst take Pen in Hand to write any thing beyond a Billet the Enterprize seems very terrible I confess when you spoke to me of it first I was well enough pleased with the Design for I thought a Defence of the Sex would be a Means of obliging all of the Sex who were worth defending and therefore look'd upon it as the writing a Circular LoveLetter to all the fair Ladies in the Kingdom But as Men generally mix Interest with Honour so upon second Thoughts I considered what I should get by it besides Fame if it should succeed and I found if I persuaded all Men to be as passionate Servants to the Ladies as myself I should make but a very indifferent hand of it Thus  Madam  you would engage me in a Controversy where it would be a Scandal to be vanquished and a Disadvantage to overcome For I who could never succeed in an Amour where there was any Fool pretended besides myself should have great Hopes indeed when I had persuaded all Mankind to be my Rivals After all  Madam  there were your Commands to encourge me to it and the Commands of a fair Lady are to me beyond all the Arguments  in Nature I therefore resolved upon the Undertaking But as it is no new thing to see People undertake a Business that they are altogether unable to perform so I must own I found a thing of this Nature quite beyond my Strength You may believe  Madam  I was very melancholy at it and it was then that a Friend coming into my Chamber asked me the Occasion As I never love to conceal any thing that afflicts me from a Friend so I presently told him the Business That a Lady had commanded me to write her a Treatise in Defence of Women If that be all says he briskly I am come to your Deliverance for this very Morning have I been at a Conversation where the Question concerning the Virtues and Vices of that Sex has been handled as fully as can be desired Thou appearest to me my dear Friend said I embracing him like my better Genius and therefore without any farther Ceremony sit down and give me an Account of the Conference  Taking a Walk says he this Morning in St  James  's  Park  with several of my Acquaintance there was one among the rest who was all the while either gazing upon the Ladies as they came by or speaking with that Indifference to us that made  us very plainly see he did not mind the Subject of our Discourse tho' we talked of all the most considerable Things that offer themselves in such Conversations A very strange Man this  Madam  who was thinking upon some Mistress I warrant when they were raising Taxes and beating the  French  Another who was a Person of excellent Sense and had a particular Friendship for this tho' they would often dispute about their several Thoughts of Women in which Point they could never agree I wonder they should dispute about that  Madam  for the greatest Disputes in those Cases are when they do agree began to rally him upon this Subject which he did so handsomely that he pleased the rest of the Company very well without displeasing his Friend in the least PHILOGYNES which was the Name of the first as MISOGYNES was of the other Here  Madam  I must confess I fancied my Friend put false Names upon me for besides that I remember neither of these Families in  England  the one you must know signifies a Womanhater and the other a Womanlover cried to MISOGYNES Tho' I allow you to rally me as much as you please and am glad of any Occasion I can give you to exercise a Talent you possess in so eminent a Degree yet I hope you do not in earnest  think the Conversation of Women so ridiculous as you would make us believe Ten times worse said MISOGYNES than I can represent it and since we have often had slight Skirmishes upon that Occasion and we have now Time enough to fight it out if you have the Courage to lose one Morning's gazing at them I challenge you to the private Walk by the Canalside to defend their Cause and these Gentlemen if they please shall be our Judges Tho' I am very unwilling answered PHILOGYNES to lose a Morning that has called out all the best Company of the Town yet since it is in Defence of the Ladies and you so boldly challenge me I take you at your Word upon Condition that if I get the better in the Judgment of these Gentlemen you shall engage to be in Love by Tomorrow Morning Upon Condition that if I overcome said MISOGYNES you will engage to be out of Love by the same Time I agree That is no equal Stake replied PHILOGYNES for it is to lay Happiness against Unhappiness however I am so well satisfied of my Cause that I will undertake you even upon those Odds  Upon this Agreement we walked all to the other side of the Park full of Expectation of the Event of the Debate when we were come thither we found we had  the whole Walk to ourselves and so MISOGYNES who gave the Challenge began in this manner  The Propagation of Mankind being the only Way to preserve it from Extinction and the Copulation with Women being the only Means that Nature has ordained to that End there is no doubt but all Commonwealths ought to give any reasonable Encouragements to it I have therefore always admir'd the Wisdom of those Governments that incited or compelled their Subjects to marry as a Thing so much more necessary to Mankind in general than pleasing to any one in particular but that a Man should out of a mere Act of Judgment run after Women that he should find Delight in their Company is so very extraordinary that the wise Men of old thought it hardly possible otherwise they had had no need of making such severe Laws to force them to it as they did  Your Ladyship who is so well versed in  Greek  and  Roman  Authors knows that amongst the  Plutarch  in Life of  Licurgus  Spartans  they who lived long Batchelors were condemned to ignominious Punishments and debarred the Privileges of other Citizens That the  Strabo  Lib  Cretans  had a Law to compel all the  handsomest young Men to marry as the  Diod Sicul  B  Thurians  had to invite them to it both by Honours and Rewards That  Ibid  Lib  Plato  ordains that whoever lived a Batchelor to the five and thirtieth Year of his Age should be capable of no Honour in his Commonwealth And that the  Aul Gell  Lib Cap  Sueton  in Life of  Augustus Dion  in  ibid Lucius Florus Livy  Lib  Romans  did not only take all Care imaginable to encourage People to Marriage but frightned them into it by Punishments if they refused  Notwithstanding this had you a Design of marrying them I should not altogether so much condemn you nay had you but a Design of enjoying them without it there might be somewhat still alledged in your Excuse How unjustifiable soever such a Design may be as to the moral Part the Action itself is very agreeable to the natural But to pick them out only for the Benefit of their Conversation to fall in Love with their Understandings and to leave the Company of wise Men for handsome Women is just the same Thing as if you should chuse rather to eat Jays and Parrots than Woodcocks and Partridges because the Feathers of the former make the finer Shew  It is a very good as well as a very general Way to guess at People by the Company they keep and thus we may give a great Judgment of the Female Sex by a View of those with whom they are the most pleased of our own Well let them appear then what do you find Fine Coats large Cravatstrings and good Perriwigs I must own but for any Thing else they and their Perriwig Blocks are Critics alike It is true to do them Justice they talk most learnedly of Points and Ribbons have most mathematical Heads for the erecting of Ladies Topknots make as considerable Figures talk as loud and laugh more than any in Drawingrooms and Playhouses and those who know nothing of their Language would take them by their Gestures to be the wittiest Persons in  Christendom  but if unluckily you understand them you will find it only false Fire and that all this violent Laughter is produced by no Jest Then take them out of their own Element begin a Discourse of any Thing that is worth knowing they are dumb out of Modesty No but they hate to talk of Things that are  grossier  and the Pedantry of Scholars and Gravity of Men of Business is utterly unfit for a Gentleman  Were it nothing but the Company of such sort of Creatures as these it would be enough I should think to frighten a Man of Sense from them Can you see these Fops as much as you are used to them without laughing except it rather makes you blush to think you should bring yourself into Competition with such Tools as they are I am far from blaming them for following the Ladies They avoid the Company of Men who despise them for that of Women who admire them Nor do I find fault with the Ladies for being pleased with them for since Likeness they say breeds Love what Wonder is it they are fond of those Men whose Follies make them most like themselves but for a Man who has some Pretences to Wit and Learning for one who might be acceptable to Men of Sense to run after them nay for a Man who spends all the Morning in the Study of  Homer  and  Aristotle  to spend the Afternoon among the Impertinencies of Women puts me in mind of the Mountebank Stages in  Naples  where the Jesuits and Jackpuddings entertain the Spectators by Turns  It is possible you will say that all this makes for you that the Faults of your Rivals render your Virtues the more remarkable and that there is no doubt but  a Man of Merit may succeed in any Place where a Man of no Merit may pretend but alas Sir you deceive yourself very much if you encourage that Opinion Had you fit Judges there is no doubt but you were in the right But if the fairest Lady in  Christendom  were amongst the  Indians  where they paint the Devil of her Colour do you expect they should do her Beauty Justice Or if a slender Man were among the  Muscovites  do you think they would admire him for being well shaped where they thought none but bigbelly'd Men to be so Credit me Sir a Man who leaves his Parts to the Judgment of Women is very near the same Circumstances Will you not believe me in that Case because I profess an Enmity to them You do well but will you believe themselves View all the Town take good Notice Among all the young Heiresses who run away from their Guardians is there any one who does it with a Man of Sense Among all those Widows who ruin themselves by second Marriages is there any one who does it with a Man of Sense Among all those Ladies who cuckold their Husbands is there any one who does it with a Man of Sense We see them do these Things every Day with Chaplains Dancingmasters Butlers and Footmen Who are the Men that shew  the tender Billets received What are they who boast of the Favours of all the finest Women in Town Are they not the most despicable of Mankind Are they not such whose Conversation is the Jest of Men of Sense And have they above one Thing about them that distinguishes them from the other Sex  After all Sir are not the  Women  in the right in this Point Or do they ever shew more Judgment than when they pitch upon such Men What do they look for in a Husband but one who will admire them who will be governed by them and upon whom all their little Tricks will pass And who but Fools are fit for that What do they propose in a Gallant but giving them Pleasure without Scandal And to the former Part they have a received Notion of the Ability of Fools Then for the Scandal who so likely to give none as those Men whom the World will hardly believe were favoured by them tho' they took their Oaths upon it For notwithstanding Experience teaches us the contrary yet People are apt to fancy a Man of Sense must succeed before a Coxcomb and will rather believe the former are favoured tho' they swear they are not than the latter tho' they swear they are  But alas Sir Men of Sense they think know them and that they take as well as I do to be a sure Means to hinder their being in Love It was upon this Account that  Chap  c  Solomon  gives such severe Characters of them in his  Proverbs  that  V Stobaei Senten  cap  de Vituperio Mulierum  Euripides  represented them so faithfully as to get the Name of the Womanhater that  V Stobaei Senten  cap  de Vituperio Mulierum  Simonides  has distinguished them into so many sorts of evil Things that  See the  Dialogues  of the  Courtesans  and that of  Love  Lucian  has so naturally described their Tricks that  Homily  on the Beheading St  John Baptist  St  Chrysostom  has made such a severe Invective against them that  Satire  th  Juvenal  has given his Friend such Counsel against having any Thing to do with them and in fine it is upon the same Account that all the Epigrammatists Comic Poets and Satirists are so continually exposing them to the World making their Follies ridiculous and their Vices odious It is upon the same Account likewise that to call a Man Effeminate has always been reckoned such a Reproach and that to say a Man is governed by a Woman has been one of the worst Characters you could give of his Understanding  See here a dreadful Army  Madam  against us I asked my Friend what these Gentlemen had said upon this Occasion He told me  Juvenal  had written a very severe Satire the XIth against Women which I should see very much to its Advantage if I would consult Mr  Dryden  's Translation of it For  Simonides  he told me he had written  Iambics  against them in which he divides them into  ten  Sorts The  first  he said was descended from a  Sow  you will find very noble Families among them  Madam  and she was sluttish The  second  from a  Fox  and she understands every thing and has a great deal of Good in her and a great deal of Ill too The  third  from a  Dog  and she is prying about and snarling at every Body The  fourth  is made of the  Earth  and she understands nothing but how to fill her Belly and sit by the Fireside The  fifth  of the  Sea  and she is changeable and inconstant sometimes in a Calm and then on a sudden in a Storm The  sixth  is made of  Ashes  and a  Labouring Ass  an odd Composition you will say and she is scarce driven to her Business with Threatnings or Force but crams herself Night and Day and lies with every one that comes now whether she takes this Quality of lying with all who come from the Father'sside or the Mother'sside I  cannot absolutely determine The  seventh  was descended from a  Pole Cat  and she is nauseous and stinking The  eighth  from a  Mare  and she never cares to do any Work and minds nothing but appearing neat and fine The  ninth  from a  Monkey  and her Ugliness is a Jest to every body The  tenth  from a  Bee  and she makes an excellent Wife  Camerar Hist Med L C  There is a Story also of this  Simonides  that being asked about a Wife he said she was the Shipwreck of Man the Tempest of a House the Disturber of Rest the Prison of Life a daily Punishment a sumptuous Conflict a Beast in Company a necessary Evil And  On  Matt  Chap xix  St  Chrysostom  besides the Homily upon the beheading St  John Baptist  which is almost all an Invective against Women says in another Place What is a Wife The Enemy of Love the inevitable Pain the necessary Evil the natural Temptation a desirable Calamity a domestical Peril a pleasing Damage Thus you see these Ancients Madam had a very commendable Faculty of calling Names What think you might not the Matrons of  Billinsgate  improve in their Conversation But it is natural  when People cannot convince our Reason to endeavour to move our Passions  I know you will object against these  Anacreon Theocritus Catullus Tibullus Ovid Horace Propertius  and all those Poets and Wits ancient and modern who pleas'd themselves whilst they lived in the Pursuit of Women and have render'd themselves immortal after their Death by the Trophies they raised to them It is confessed that spending their Time upon the Sex they ought to know them best But on the other side to excuse their own spending their Time ought to represent them as favourably as possible and yet pray what is the Account they give us of them Do they not all with one Consent complain either of the Cruelty or Falshood of their Mistresses Are not their Books full of Quarrels Picques and Jealousies and do they not shew the Levity Perjury and Lewdness of the Sex Does not  Od  Anacreon  and a hundred more tell you they

what they are Let us view these pleasant Comfits that are to make the Poison go down Let us enjoy a little of that Conversation that is diversitive enough to make People neglect all their Danger Sit in one of their DrawingRooms all Day observe the Discourse which passes is it not a tedious Repetition of the same Impertinencies over and over again to every new Visitant And is not one Half of that spent in censuring all the Town and the other Half in railing at those who censure Do they not inveigh against the Lampooners and at the same time talk as scandalously as they can  write The horrid Affectation the ridiculous Vanity the gross Dissimulation and the inveterate Malice that appears in all their Discourses are Things for which I should think all the Paint on their Faces could not make Amends For my own part I confess I have been Fool enough to be in Love too and have follow'd Women upon that Account but to another sort of End than you say you do But when that End was once satisfied to talk with them afterwards was as great a Penance to me as it would be to sit in a greasy Cook's Shop when my Belly was full  This MISOGYNES is a very rude Fellow and I am sure your Ladyship will be of my Opinion that his last Simile was very fulsome It is a Sign he hates Women for had he conversed with them they would have taught him better Manners  But there are doubtless you will say Women of Understanding Pray where are they Is it your prudent Woman your good Housewife who is plaguing all the World with her Management and instructing every body how to feed Geese and Capons Or is it your Politician who is always full of Business who carries a Secretary of State's Office in her Head and is making her deep Observations upon every  Day's News Or is it your learned Woman' who runs mad for the Love of hard Words' who talks a mixt Jargon or  Lingua Franca'  and has spent a great deal of Time to make her capable of talking Nonsense in four or five several Languages What think you Sir do you not wish for your Visitant again as the more tolerable Folly of the two Do not you think Learning and Politics become a Woman as ill as riding astride And had not the Duke of  Montagne  's Essays

's Travels  Turkey  at this Day You cannot but be sensible Sir that there is no Necessity of going so far for Instances of their Lewdness and were it civil to quote the Lampoons or write the Amours of our own Time we might be furnished with Examples enough nearer Home  Here Madam I could not forbear telling my Friend that his Disputant grew scurrilous He told me considering him as a Womanhater he thought it was no more than his Character required and that if I compared his Discourse with what others had said against them I should think him a very wellbred Man  After this to talk of their Levity or Babling what were it but trifling All the Lovers and Poets who have had any thing to do with them can furnish themselves with Instances enough of the first and any Man who will give himself the Trouble of reading any one History shall find Instances enough of the other if his own Wisdom has hindered him from makeing them at his own Cost  Plutarch  of  Garrulity  There being a Senate called in  Rome  upon some very extraordinary Occasion one of the Senators was desired by his Wife to tell her what it was He reply'd He was obliged to Secrecy she swears it shall never be known to any one by her Means upon that Promise he informs her that there was a  Lark  seen flying over the SenateHouse with a golden Helmet on his Head and a Spear in one of his Claws and that they had thereupon called the Soothsayers together to know what it portended No sooner was the Husband gone but the Wife tells it too under a Vow of Secrecy to her Maid she to another who was her FellowServant who told it to her Lover so that to be short it ran so fast that as soon as the Senator came into the MarketPlace one took him aside and told it him for a great Secret aways goes he and tells  his Wife she had undone him in divulging what he had trusted with her She denies it with a true feminine Impudence How could it come to be known then says he Alas reply'd she are there not three hundred Senators and might it not come from any of them as well as you No says he for I invented it on a sudden to satisfy your Curiosity and thus had I been served if I had trusted you with the Secret It is such another Story they tell us of young  Papirius  to his Mother who asking him what had been debated that Morning in the Senate told her They were making a Law for Men to have a Plurality of Wives But it is somewhat a more tragical Relation  Plutarch  gives of  Fulvius Augustus  complained to him that he was dissatisfied with what he had done in adopting  Livia  's Sons and disinheriting his own Nephews  Fulvius  goes home and tells it his Wife she tells it to the Empress who upbraids the Emperor with it  Augustus  when he saw  Fulvius  next checked him for it by which he perceived himself ruined and therefore went immediately told his Wife what she had done and that he resolved to stab himself But certainly the Wife's Answer was very sufficient Nor did you deserve less said she who having lived so  long with me did not know I could not keep a Secret  But omitting these whose Actions are recorded to their Infamy let us see a little of those who are quoted as the Glories of their Sex And who more cry'd up amongst them than  Jud xiii  Judith  What Action more celebrated than her murdering  Holofernes  when he had treated her with all the Kindness and Respect imaginable in his Tent For my part I must own my Virtue does not arrive to so high a Pitch and should rather have suffered my Town to have been ruin'd than have been guilty of an Action that appears to me so barbarous but I confess that of  Judges iv v  Jael  is yet worse to invite a Man into her Tent promise him Protection and when he had trusted his Life in her Hands to murther him whilst he was asleep

El  Ovid  and  Speaking of  Ulysses    Ad vetulam tamen ille suam properabat omnis  Mens erat in cunno Penelopea tuo  Quae sic casta manes ut jam convivia visas  Ut{que} fututorum sit tua plena domus  E quibus ut scires quicunque valentior esset  Haec es ad arrectos verba locuta procos  Nemo meo melius nervum tendebat Ulysse  Sive illî laterum seu fuit artis opus  Qui quoniam periit modò vos intendite qualem  Esse virum sciero vir sit ut ille meus  Priapeia  Virgil  if the  Priapeia  are his make malicious Reflections upon her trying her Lovers Strength in a Bow but take the Story as it lies in the  Odysses  I am sure she would hardly pass for such a Saint in our Days and if a Lady had her House full of Lovers for twenty Years of her Husband's absence and if her Husband were forced to fight all these before he could have his Wife again it is possible the Lampooners of the Town would not have represented her Case so favourably as  Homer  has done But what shall we say to  V Domin in Ovid  El L See also  Seneca  's Epistles  Lycophron  even amongst the  Greeks  who speaks of her as a most profligate sort of Woman or to  Lilius Giral Hist Deorum Gent Pan  Duris Samius  who asserts her to have been so very common as to have lain with all Comers during her Husband's Absence from whose promiscuous Copulations  Pan  was born and therefore took the Name  Pan  your Ladyship knows in  Greek  signifies  All  For  Lucretia  I shall  not insinuate as a  Sir  Charles Sedley  in his Translation of  Ovid  's VIIIth Elegy B  great Wit seems to do that she stabbed herself rather than return to the Embraces of a Husband after having been so much better pleased by a Gallant but if she were one who valued her Chastity so much and her Life so little as they would make us believe it is somewhat odd that she should rather let  Tarquin  enjoy her alive than a Slave lie in the Bed with her when she was dead and that she should chuse to commit the Sin rather than bear the Shame  But let us forgive them all these Things I have mentioned and since  L'Art de Connoitre les Hommes  Or Art how to know Men C  Le Chambre  assures us that there is no Beauty in a Woman but what is a Sign of some Vice let us attribute it to Nature's Fault not theirs and reckon that the more vicious they are the nearer they come to the Perfection of the Sex and indeed not spending much Time in their Conversations I will pardon them all their Levity Babling Malice and Impertinence and being unmarried shall not be so severe upon their Lusts and Adulteries provided they will stop there Let  Helen  run away from her Husband with a handsomer Man but let her not suffer all  Troy  to be ruined for the  keeping her there Let  Clytemnestra  lye with another Man during her Husband's Absence but let her not murder him for it when he comes home Let  Diodor Sicul B  Semiramis  make use of all the handsomest Fellows of her Army but let her not put them to Death for fear they should tell Tales And tho' I would forgive her yet her own Sex would never pardon her being the first Maker of  Ammian Marcellin B  Eunuchs Let  Phaedra  and  Fausta  invite their Husbands Sons to supply their Fathers Defects but let them not accuse them and have them put to Death for refusing Let  Joan  of  Naples  make use of all the Men in her Kingdom but let her not strangle her Hushand for his Imperfections in a Point that he could not help That Cruelty and Barbarity I confess is what provokes me so much against the Sex I can see  Tibullus  's Mistress jilt him for a Fool who is not half so handsome I can see  Ovid  waiting all Night at his Mistress's Door whilst another Man is in her Arms and I can see half a Score impertinent Women plaguing you with nonsensical Stories and be very well diverted all the while But I confess I cannot hear of  Medea  's cutting her Brother in Pieces and strewing his Limbs in the Way  to stop her pursuing Father without Horror and Dread nor of her treating her own Children after the same manner to revenge herself upon  Jason  without a like Emotion I know not how other People may bear such Things but for my Part when I see all the Murders and Barbarities they commit to revenge themselves on their inconstant Lovers to get rid of their Husbands for some one they like better or to prevent the Discovery of their Lewdness but my Hair stands on end my Blood shrinks and I am possess'd with an utter Detestation of the Sex Go but one Circuit with the Judges here in  England  observe how many Women are condemned for killing their Bastard Children and tell me if you think their Cruelties can be equalled or whether you think those who commit such Actions fit for your or for any civil Conversation But I see by your Looks you are convinced I see you abandon your Cause and I shall cease to expose any farther a Sex of whose Patronage you seem already ashamed  Here MISOGYNES left off and PHYLOGYNES began to answer him But I must beg your Pardon Sir said my Friend for my Time is come and I must necessarily be gone The Devil you shall said I you would engage me in a pretty Affair I promise  a Lady a Defence of her Sex and you will make me send her a Satire against it Truly my dear Friend said he I designed to have told you all but it is later than I thought and I have Business waits for me No Business said I can be so considerable to you as the satisfying a fair Lady is to me therefore sit down and bring me fairly off what you have told me already or you and I shall be Friends no longer After all  Madam  to tell you the Truth tho' there is no great Matter in this Speech of MISOGYNES yet I can hardly believe he made it upon a sudden 'tis possible tho' they two having discoursed the Matter as they told us before might have provided themselves each with Arguments But supposing that I can scarce believe one Man would be suffered to talk so long without Interruption at least I am sure some who we know were none of the Company But it is possible that he who told me might leave out all that was spoke by others for Brevity sake being as you see in haste  If you are as apt to be mistaken in your Judgment of Things as of Looks replied PHILOGYNES it is no wonder you should make such strange Conclusions Whatever Seriousness you may see in my Face does not I'll assure you proceed from any Distrust of my Cause but an Astonishment at  what strange Arguments the Invention of Man can suggest against the best Things that are I say the Invention of Man for I am far from believing you in earnest in this Point I have too just an Opinion of MISOGYNES to think he does any Thing but put on this Humour for a Trial of Skill and I no more believe you a Hater of Women for the Invective you have made against them than I believe  Erasmus  a Lover of Folly for the Encomium he has writ upon it If you have therefore any thing more to urge forbear it not upon any supposed Conviction you see in my Countenance for notwithstanding that I think you have handled the Subject as fully as any one who has undertaken it yet I will assure you I cannot submit to your Arguments and therefore am very ready to hear any thing you have further to urge No says MISOGYNES I am sensible I have troubled the Company long enough about a Trifle and it is very fit you should have your Turn of speaking now Part of the Company was already convinced by his Arguments the other Part thought he had said as much as the Matter would bear and therefore both agreed in desiring PHILOGYNES to speak what he had to say which he did in this Manner  I confess Sir said he smiling when I saw the Associates you allotted me at first I began to despair of my Cause I own I was ashamed of my Company and resolved to pack up Baggage instantly and quit a Trade in which none but Fops and Fools were engaged but when I saw the  Anacreons  the  Ovids  and all the Wits antient and modern in the same Circumstances I even took Heart again Courage said I the Business is not so bad as I thought and it is possible his Heart may relent and allow us some better Company than he condemned us to at first At least thought I if it is a Folly to converse with Women it is some Comfort that he owns it to be a Folly of which the greatest Wits of the World have been guilty before us And when I saw all  Greece  and the greater Part of  Asia  venturing their Lives for  One  Woman I thought I had somewhat the Advantage of them whilst I ventured nothing but my Rhetoric for them  All  together And when you named  Samson Achilles Hannibal  and  Mark Anthony  I enquired who those Gentlemen were for certainly thought I if they were such brave Men and great Soldiers as I have heard them represented we have no Reason to despair of the Victory when we have them to lead us on  You might have spoken more generally of them too if you had pleased you might have told us that there never was a great Soldier  who was not as famous for his Amours as his Battles  that a Poet was scarce thought free of his Trade  who had not paid some Duties to Love  Cowley  's Preface  and you might have added to these all the Wisemen and Philosophers of the World You might have informed us that  David  tho' a Man after God's own Heart was not contented without some Share in the Womens That  Solomon  who knew the Virtue of every Plant from the Cedar of  Libanus  to the Hysop that grows upon the Wall took as much Pains to have as general a Knowledge of the Ladies That  See  Diogenes Laertius  in his Lives of these Three Philo+sophers  Socrates  who was the ugliest as well as the wisest Man of his Time would in spite of Nature aim at Love too and not terrified by one ill Wife would try to mend his Hand in another That  See  Diogenes Laertius  in his Lives of these Three Philo+sophers  Plato  whom Antiquity has called Divine did not spend all his Time in erecting Commonwealths but that some of it was bestowed upon the  Xantippe  's and  Archeanassa  's That  See  Diogenes Laertius  in his Lives of these Three Philo+sophers  Aristotle  whom  Philip  made Governor to  Alexander  made himself a Slave to his Mistress that this  was not an Effect of his Passion alone but of his Reason    Diog Laert  in  Aristot  That he said Love was not only upon the Account of Copulation but Philosophy and commands his Wiseman to be in Love before he bids him meddle with the Commonwealth And in fine that this great Man who fathomed all Arts and Sciences who has given us the best Rules of Philosophy Politics Poetry  c  did also not think it unbecoming his Gravity to write one Treatise of Love and four Amatory Theses You might have mingled Sacred Story with Profane You might have told us that St  Peter  was married that St  Paul  defended the leading about a Sister that we owe one of the most celebrated  St  Austin  was converted by his Mother  Fathers of the Church to the Endeavours and Conversion of a Woman and that St  Jerom  had so great an Esteem for the Sex as to dedicate a great Part of his Works to some of them You might have added to these a thousand more which you see I purposely omit to avoid Prolixity and mention none but whom you will allow to be the most celebrated of their Profession without doing your Cause and Injury in the least for after all it is  but shewing us a Drawingroom of Fops reading a Dialogue out of  Lucian  seeing a Scene of a Play quoting a Sentence out of  Solomon  's Proverbs searching all History for two or three ill Women and the Business is done the Cause is gained let the Trumpets sound and  Io Poean  be sung for the Victory  I am sorry Sir that I cannot be as civil to you as you have been to me It goes against my Conscience to place you with so bad Company considering with what you have obliged me and of those few great Men whom you have seduced to your Party I am concerned that I must take better Part from you I fancy after what I have already said of  Solomon  after reflecting upon his History you cannot think him a true Friend to your Cause and therefore will not I hope depend too much upon him I shall say nothing of his Wives and Concubines I shall not so much as mention his  Canticles  which  Est autem  It is a Dialogue between  Solomon  and the King of  Egypt  's Daughter two Chorus's one of young Men the other of Virgins who lay near the Bedchamber speaking between The Nuptial Secrets lye hid here under modest Words which was the Cause the ancient  Hebrews  would not suffer this Book to be read but by those who were near Marriage  Grot in Canti    Grotius  as well as I affirms to be a LovePoem and which  Rapin  de Carmine Pastorali  Rapin  reckons both the first and best of Pastorals but I shall attack you at your own Weapon I shall oppose Proverb against Proverb if he has been severe in them upon ill Women whose Cause I do not undertake he has spoken as favourably of the  Proverbs  Chap last  c  Wise and the Good for whom we appear In like manner if  Euripides  has represented Women so in his Tragedies as to get the Name of the Womanhater I appeal from his Writings to his Life and Conversation which shew him far otherwise If  Simonides  gives you severe Characters of several Women he gives you one at last that makes amends for all one in whom no Fault can be found and if you think that is not enough to take him off from your Party if you are still so very fond of him we will tell you that Men who are deformed and ugly as  Girald  in vit  Simonidis Plutatch  in vit  Themistoclis  Simonides  was naturally declare themselves Enemies to Women because they fancy Women are Enemies to them and upon that Account not upon the Account of his Wit we will allow him to you As for St  Chrysostom  tho' we have all the Respect imaginable for a Father of Church and upon that Account  shall not enter into the Merits of the Cause betwixt  V Socrat Schol Sozomen Evagr  him and the Empress  Eudoxia  yet this we shall say Sir that as Fathers of the Church are subject to Passions as well as other Men so it is no Wonder that a Man who is used very ill by one Woman and converses with few else should conclude them all alike Thus after having taken two of your Patriots from you and if not taken at least disabled the other two from being very credible Witnesses you are reduced to  Lucian  and  Juvenal  For the former if I should quote you what the old Fathers say of him if I should tell you that he did not only abuse the Christian Religion but even his own that he rallied all the Philosophers Orators and Historians of his Time that not content with that he falls foul upon those his own Religion taught him to worship as Gods I fancy you would not think what such a Man says of any great Weight but truly Sir there is no need of that in this Case What does this  Lucian  do pray Why  See the Dialogues of the Courtesans  he describes the Bawds griping covetous and encouraging their Daughters in Lewdness his Courtesans false jilting and true Courtesans throughout And what of all this pray what does this make for you  It is not the Cause of Bawds or Courtesans that we undertake tho' even amongst them he represents a great part easy loving goodnatur'd Fools and us'd accordingly by their Lovers But does  Lucian  pretend that there are no good Women Does he fall upon the Sex in general or does not he bring in  In the Dialogue of Love  Charicles  in one place defending them and does not he make the greatest Encomium that can be of  Panthaea  in another and speak with abundance of Esteem of several other Women in the same And if he does introduce  Callicratides  in one of his Dialogues railing at the Sex in Opposition to  Charicles  he does it in the Defence of a Sin which I am sure you will scarce think it civil to name What shall we say to  Juvenal  but what  Plato  did to  Xenocrates  bid him sacrifice to the Graces He is always violent always declaiming always in a Passion and what Wonder if he falls upon the Women in one of his Fits After all you will make no great Matter of him for if he has writ one Satire upon the Women he has writ fifteen upon the Men For the comic Poets and Satirists whom you mention in general when you name them in particular I shall give them particular Answers And now truly Sir see yourself reduced to a miserable Equipage  some old Husbands and jilted Lovers some Men with ill Faces and worse Miens may possibly stick to you still but that is all I am sorry to see a Man so well made of so much Wit and who has been so successful amongst the Ladies rank himself with such a Tribe but you do it I suppose by way of Variety only and so let  Misogynes  appear at the Head of his Regiment that makes a worse Figure than Sir  John Falstaffe  's let them be encouraged with stummed Wine and muddy Ale let them give Fire to their Mundungus and so let the Battel begin whilst we with all the Heroes Wits and Philosophers see how we can defend the Cause we have undertaken  I am sensible Sir that I have broken the Order of your Discourse and I beg your Pardon for it But I thought it was necessary to distinguish our Enemies from our Friends before the Armies joined that so we might know whom to attack and whom to spare and having done that I shall now confine myself to your Method and follow the Course that you please to lead me  Though I perfectly agree with you in the Esteem of the Laws made for the Encouragement of Marriage and consequently cannot but regret the Want of them  amongst ourselves yet I must beg your Pardon Sir if I wholly dissent from you in the Inference you would draw from it For it is very apparent to me and to any unbyassed Person else I suppose that those Laws were never made as you fancy for the forcing Men to the Love of Women to which all Countries were naturally enough enclined but for the restraining them to Particulars that whilst they followed the general Pleasures of the Sex they might not lose the useful Part which was the Procreation of Children Had there been so few Virtues amongst them as you please to imagine there had been no Need of this When we have but one Dish of Meat that we like we fall upon that without any Deliberation but when the Fancy is distracted with Variety of Dainties we often lose more Time in the making our Choice than would otherwise be requisite to the satisfying our Appetites  It is true Sir it is a very good Way to judge of People by the Company they are fond of but it is not a certain Way to judge of People by the Company that is fond of them There was a Taylor in Love with Queen  Elizabeth  but it does not necessarily follow that Queen  Elizabeth  was in Love with a Taylor If there are ridiculous Fellows who follow the Ladies  before we run down the Ladies for it let us see if they do not laugh at them as well as we our selves And I cannot think their pursuing them any Reason at all for Men of Sense to avoid them You would think it very hard that  Alexander  and  Caesar  should quit the Art of War because some  Thrasoes  and bragging Bullies pretended to it as well as they and  Virgil  and  Horace  would take it very ill that you should damn all Sorts of Poetry because of the  Bavius  's and  Maevius  's who set up for it and whatever Reason you would give against the being a Minister of State I dare say Sir  Politic Woudbee  's aiming at it would be none Here  Philogynes  seems to me not to understand the right Use of that considerable Part of Mankind call'd Fools For it is only the HalfWit that is intolerable and a true Fool is next a true Wit the best Company in the World for as a noble Author has extreamly well observed  Wit like Terce Claret when't begins to pall  Neglected lies and's of no Use at all  But in its full Perfection of Decay  Turns Vinegar and comes again in Play  DORSET  After this I need not tell you Sir that it is very ill judging of People by their Outside and as I laugh at those who like a Man only for his being well dressed so I fancy you will allow them to be as ridiculous who run him down only for the same Reason It was objected against  Diogenes Laertius  in vit  Aristot  Aristotle  and  Plutarch  in vit  Ciceronis  Cicero  that they were too sumptuous in their Apparel and overcurious in their Dress and without doubt there were deep  See  Verres  's Jests upon  Cicero  for his Effeminacy  Plut  Critics in those Times said they minded nothing but making themselves fine who yet without any Offence to their Learning we may suppose could not give so good an Account of their Studies as these two great Men have done of theirs  Courage there are two good Precedents for the Beaux  After all Sir I know there are a great many of these gay Coxcombs of these eternal Pretenders to Love and I have nothing to say in their Behalf let them even shift for themselves amongst the  Thrasoes  and  Bavius  's But they do not only pretend you say they are successful too It is very possible Sir I do not know but there may  be Fools enough of the other Sex to like the Fools of ours But it is with the best Sort of Women too you say that they succeed And who tells you so pray They themselves I swear Sir though I have a very great Esteem for those Gentlemen yet I must beg their Pardon for my Faith in this Point I can never think a Woman whose Wit we all allow can be fond of a Man whose Folly we all see On the other side I know how natural it is for every one to avoid Contempt and when a Man is despised in one Place what so reasonable as to make you believe he is esteemed in another And I hope the Gentlemen themselves will take it for a Compliment when I tell them I do not believe a Word they say in this Point since certainly a Man of Honour would rather of the two tell a Lye to the Prejudice of a Woman who uses him ill than a Truth to the utter Ruin of one who grants him all the Favours he can ask  But let us judge them by their Actions say you Do not most of the young Heiresses run away with the pitiful Fellows If they do Sir it should rather deserve your Pity than your Anger or if you must be angry be angry with the Guardians whose Severity frighten them away and yet hinders them the Sight of  any Men of Merit to run away with It is no Wonder that one who has never seen any Town but where he was born should think that the finest in the World and you cannot blame a Woman for being in Love with a Man who does not deserve her if she never saw any who did All that we can reasonably expect in that Point is that she should make some Satisfaction when she sees the World better and if she shews her Contempt of her Choice then it is as much if not more than can be required In like manner you cannot say a Widow makes an ill choice except you prove she was offered a better If a Man who is obliged to ride a Journey does it upon an ill Horse you will be very well satisfy'd certainly when he tells you it is the best he could get I confess Madam this seems to me but a very indifferent Excuse for the Widows for he would make us believe it is but next Oars with them and so I told my Friend but he reply'd I must consider it is only those Widows who make an ill Choice about which he is to speak and as he cannot say of them as of the young Maids that it was for want of seeing the World so they must be contented with this Excuse or make a better for themselves For the Wives who you say cuckold their Husbands there may be somewhat  more to be said Modesty being almost an inseparable Quality of Wit there is no Wonder that a Man who is possessed of that should so seldom succeed in these Undertakings whilst Fools by their natural Impudence push on the Thing and married Women are a sort of Forts that are sooner taken by Storm than Treaty So that this shews rather the great Confidence of the Man than the little Judgment of the Woman who it is forty to one had much rather a Man of Sense was possessed of her if he would take the same Methods to gain her as the other had done  After all Madam I think none of these Excuses extraordinary therefore if I were worthy to advise the Ladies they should rather make Use of Men of Wit in all these Capacities than put their Friends to the Trouble of inventing such pitiful Defences for them  Now Sir as I cannot see any Reason why Women should naturally love Fools more than Men of Wit so I shall very hardly be brought to believe they do In a Husband I suppose they propose a Man whose Conversation shall be agreeable as well as his Person and who shall have Wit to entertain them as well as Wisdom to direct them and in whom can this be found but in Men of the best Sense If in  a Gallant as you say they propose Pleasure without Scandal tis very hard the Heat that warms a Man's Brain should so entirely settle there as to render him incapable of pleasing them otherwise though it is possible by reason of his having Variety of Thoughts to divert him he may not give himself so entirely up to those Pleasures as People less capable of thinking do And for the Scandal who so proper to hinder that as those who have Prudence to manage Things so as not to be found out and Wit enough to turn it off if they are Whilst a Fool by his Want of Sense shall quickly make the Thing public if there be an Intrigue or by his Vanity brag of one though there be none Add to this that when a Woman seems pleased with a Man of Wit every body is apt to attribute it to the Pleasure of his Conversation whereas when she is fond of a Man in whom we can see nothing to be liked we naturally suppose she likes him for something that we do not see And though it is possible it may be only Want of Judgment in the Lady yet the World is apt to compliment her Understanding in that Case to the Prejudice of her Reputation And to conclude Sir though I do not believe all those Men successful who say they are not yet I am very much inclined to believe  all those Men not to be successful who say they are  For your Examples of Womenhaters I have sufficiently I think reply'd to them already and for your other Arguments if it be an Affront to call a Man effeminate I hope you do not think it any great Compliment to tell a Woman she is masculine and had that Argument been urged against you I dare answer for you you would have said that that only proved the Perfections of the Sexes different and as Man was made for the ruder Labours it was requisite he should be strong and coarse and the Women being made for the easier Things ought to be soft tender and delicate And as for Mens being governed by their Wives though the being hector'd by them is not so commendable yet it  V Alex ab Alex L C  was observed by  Plutarch in vit Cato  Cato  of the  Romans  that they governed all the World and that their Wives governed them Amongst the  V Leges  Connubiale  Assyrians  it was a Custom introduced by  Semiramis  who had ruled that Kingdom with so much Glory that the Wives should have Dominion over the Husbands The same Custom prevailed likewise among  the  Nicholaus  and from him  Stobaeus  Serm  Sauromatae  and the  Diodor Sieul L  Aegyptians  had an express Law to that Purpose We know how much the  Aristot  Politic L Cap  Spartans  the bravest Men of the World were commanded by their Wives and that all the Care and Management of domestic Affairs was committed to them So that I cannot imagine how a Thing should be so very scandalous that was practised by most of the bravest People under the Sun  Here are very good Precedents for married Women which it is to be hoped they will lay up in their Hearts and practise in their Lives and Conversations  I have as great a Veneration for those Poets you mention as any Man can and upon that Account I shall not believe all the Ill they say of their Mistresses because I suppose they would not have me As I have been a Lover myself so I know very well that People are apt in those Cases to take Suspicions for Realities and Surmises for Matter of Fact Does not  See the Tragedy by Mr  Dryden  Aurengzebe  call  Indamora  faithless and ingrate And yet I believe he would be very angry that you should call her so too  and would not any one who came in when he was in one of his Rants conclude a Man who loved so well would not be enraged against a Mistress at that rate unless her Falshood was very apparent And yet when we come to examine the Cause of this Disorder what is it but  Morats  giving him his Life at her Request or his leaning upon her Lap when he died I rather mention this than any of the Poets you spoke of not only because all the Motions and Passions of a Lover are described with as much Art and Delicacy as in any of those Antients but also that seeing the whole Business before you you may judge of every little Cause of his Disorder as well as he himself which in Odes and Elegies you cannot do You see the Lover there in a Fury but what Cause he has to be so there is no body to tell you but he who is in it Add to this that a Man often feigns Jealousy of his Mistress to binder her from being so of him and will upbraid her Falshood to defend his own That is a Thing now I confess Madam which I can hardly believe And it is evident they had not really any such bad Opinion of Women since with all this they did not cease to run after them However if you think these general Answers not sufficient let us see what we can say to Particulars  For the Complaints of Cruelty and Scorn I look upon them as Things of Course and therefore shall say nothing to them If  Anacreon  's Mistress did ask him nothing but Money why did he chuse one whose Necessities drove her upon it And if other Men have made Complaints of the Womens minding Wealth more than Love I desire to know whether Women have not as much Reason to make the same Complaints of the Men And for those who talk of their Mistresses Inconstancy let us see first whether they were constant to them For  Ovid  he does not pretend to put it upon you but complains in  Eleg L  one Place of his being in Love with two at once and tells you frankly in  Eleg L  another that he was in Love with all the Town For  Horace Suetonius  or whoever it was that writ his Life informs you that he was intemperately given to Women and what Wonder then that a Man who try'd so many should find one or two false  Tibullus  had two  Delia Nemesis  Mistresses whom he celebrates by Name and there are some more Elegies that it does not appear whether they are writ to them or others and though  he tells us the  Rumor ait crebro nostram peccasse putam  Quid miserum torques Rumor acerbe tace  Report was that his Mistress was kind to other Men yet the Report gave him so much Torment that he desired it should be stifled if therefore you have any Friendship for him endeavour to fulfil his Desire in that Point For  Propertius  besides his  Aspice uti coelo modo Sol modo Luna ministrat  Sic etiam nobis una puella parum  Lib El  intemperate Love of all Women he tells you his  Lib El  Mistress caught him with two Wenches at the same Time and confesses that he rails at the Incontinence of Women only because she upbraided him with his Thus whatever Qualifications those great Men had Constancy you see was none and though we allow you each of them had Merit enough for any one Woman yet one Man can hardly have enough for half a Score  Now if Ruin and Desolation has come to great Men and States from Women it shewed they had a good Opinion of the Sex in general that they would suffer for them and had they not been sensible the greatest Part were good they could never have been imposed upon by the Bad Then as for those ill Women whom you have  mentioned as I suppose you will not undertake to defend all the Actions of Tyrants and Murderers so I do not think myself at all obliged to defend all the Women who have been guilty of some of their Crimes The Dispute is not whether there have been any ill Women in the World but whether there are not more Good And when I have told you that the Book that condemns  Dalilah  cries up  Deborah  and  Jael  That if  Homer  has represented  Helen  guilty of some Faults for you will see that  Homer  does not represent her Cause so violently bad he tells us of  Hecuba  and  Andromache  and a Thousand others who were very good ones That if  Clytemnestra  was false to  Agamemnon Penelope  was as famous for her Truth to  Ulysses  and so put you Example against Example which I forbear to do only because it is so very easy should I I say do but this you could not complain that your Arguments were unanswered But truly Sir we might carry the Thing much farther we might defend some of those Women you mentioned and excuse the rest For  Dalilah  I shall say say nothing out of Respect to the Scripture that represents her as an ill Woman it is possible were she alive she might tell you in her own Defence that what Account you have of her is from  her professed Enemies That however taking the Thing as they tell it if she did commit a Piece of Treachery it was against an Enemy of her Country and that it was very hard she should be so much run down for the same Thing they have so much admired in  Jael  and  Judith  as well as every body else did in  Marcus Brutus  she would perhaps push her Defence further and tell you that though she deliver'd  Samson  to the  Philistines  to be kept Prisoner yet she neither drove a Nail through his Head nor cut it off But for  Helen  give me Leave to tell you it is a great Dispute amongst the Historians whether she was forced away by  Paris  or went by her own Consent several are of the former Opinion and  Prologom ad Apollon  Hoelztzim  says plainly he wonders  Homer  will put such a ridiculous Story upon the World as to make her the Occasion of the  Trojan  War  Menelaus  it must be confessed Madam if the Story be true was a very easy goodnatur'd Husband who would be at so much Pains and Charge to fetch back a Wife who run away with another Man I do not remember in my own Memory to have known above five or six Examples like it And  Plato  in  Phaed  speaks as if  the belying her were the Cause of  Homer  's Blindness as well as of  Stesichorus  's but that the latter understood the Way of expiating his Fault better and made his Recantation to this Effect That there was not a Word of Truth in the Story of her going to  Troy  If  Clytemnestra  was consenting to her Husband's Death yet it was  Egisthus  a Man who gave the Blow And if  Thais  did advise the burning  Persepolis  yet it was no less a Person than  Alexander  the Great who put it in Execution And as for  Deianira  and  Cleopatra  whatever Fatality arrived to their Lovers from them may certainly be very well excused upon the Innocence of their Intentions and their Punishment of themselves afterwards the one hanging the other poisoning herself If the  Capuan  Women destroyed  Hannibal  's Army they destroyed a Body of Enemies that all the Men in  Italy  could not In like manner for your other Instances we might tell you that  Procopius  who tells those terrible Stories of  Theodora Anecdota  is so very passionate all along and mixes such ridiculous Fables with what he tells that there is no great Credit to be given to him This  Procopius  was a Soldier under  Justinian  and has writ amongst other Things a secret History of those Times In this he represents the Empress  Theodora  more like a Devil than a Woman he makes her and the Emperor converse frequently with Spirits and makes her put them to an Employment that savours more of the Flesh than the Spirit Though granting she was as lewd as he represents her what Wonder is it that one who had been a stroling Playwench and common Strumpet before the Emperor married her should not turn Saint after If the  See  Bentivoglio Strada Garnier  Princess of  Parma  embroiled  Flanders  she did it by the Command of  Philip  for whom she governed And as for your two Queen  Mary  's  Caussin  in his  Holy Court  you know makes a Saint of the One and  Parsons  of the Other with whom I leave you to fight it out not thinking our Dispute very much concerned in it  Then Sir if there are Impertinents if there are ridiculous Persons of the other Sex I hope you do not think they are all  Platos  nor all  Aristotles  of our own And I will undertake for every Woman who plagues you with her Business for every woudbee Politician and for every Pedant amongst them to bring you double the Number of the Men If  Olivia  is impertinent in the  PlainDealer  I hope there are  Novels  and  Plausibles  who keep her  Company And if I should carry you to a City CoffeeHouse and there shew you a Parcel of People talking of Things that they understand nothing at all of and settling the Governments of Countries which they never saw as much as in a Map From thence to a PlayHouse and shew you the pert and insipid Railery of the Sparks upon the VizardMasks From thence to a  NewMarket  Course and enter you at a Table where you should hear nothing talked of but Dogs and Horses From thence to a Tavern and shew you a Set of Men in their drunken Frolics I fancy you would wish yourself in your DrawingRoom again as a more agreeable Folly than any of those I have mentioned And I appeal to you whether  Lucian  in his  Timon Boileau  in his eighth Satire and my Lord  Rochester  in his upon the like Subject say not as much against Mankind and make them as ridiculous as you can do the Women And I will assure you Sir I am far from being of the Duke of  Britanny's  Mind that Learning is unfit for a Woman and shall without any Offence either to him or you continue of the same Opinion till you have answer'd  Anna Maria Schurman  's Arguments in their Behalf and till you have taken away herself who is one of the best Arguments  This  Anna Maria Schurman  was a  Dutch  Lady of  Utrecht  of whom you will hear more anon There was a long Dispute between her and  Rivetus  Whether Learning was fit for Women 'Tis printed in her Works in  Latin  Here Madam there follows a tedious Chapter of Women who have been famous for Wit and Learning which though it may be convenient for those who question their Abilities that Way yet I do not see of what Use it can be to your Ladyship or to any who have the Honour of being acquainted with you therefore if you please Madam we will cast off here and take Hands again at the Bottom  Nor indeed you fear that I should search three several Countries and three several Ages to furnish me with a learned Woman apiece No Sir even  Greece  itself to go no further had nine Muses nine Siblys and nine Lyric Poetesses if you are delighted with the Number Nine which is three times three And if you have more Mind to Particulars we will shew you there  Vassius  de Poet Grecis  Megalostrate  the Mistress of  Alcman  who had a Gift of Poetry as well as he the Daughters of  Lilius Girald  in vit  Stesich  Stesichorus  who  were as good Poets as their Father We have also an  Eretrian Sapho  as well as she who was in Love with  Phaon Erinna  and  Demophila  the first the Mistress of  Sapho  the other equal to her who flourished all four in the same Time After these we have  Theano  the Wife of  Pythagoras  who undertook his School when he was dead with two others of the same Name if you will believe  Suidas  whereof one was a  Lyric  Poetess the other a  Thurian  who writ of  Pythagoras  We have also about the same time  Cleobulina  the Daughter of  Cleobulus  one of the seven Wise Men of  Greece  a Poetess and  Corinna  who had the Surname given her of  The Lyric Muse  We have presently after  Telesilla  an  Argive  Poetess not only famous for her Wit but for her inspiring her Countrywomen with so much Courage as to make them put to Flight the  Spartiates  who came upon them in the Absence of their Husbands At the same time lived  Praxilla  one of the nine  Lyrics  and of whom we have a Copy of Verses to  Calais  yet extant What will you say to  Aspatia Milesia  who is celebrated as a Sophistress you know the Word  Plutarch  in Vit  Themistoch  Sophister  was not then abused a Teacher of Rhetoric and a Poetess There was also  Hestiaea  mentioned by  Strabo Antyte  by  Tatian  and  Nyssis  by  Antipater Thessalus  of the two last of which there are some Things yet extant If you have a Mind to see what they did after they turned  Christians  we will produce  Eudocia  the Wife of  Theodosius  instructed in all sort of Learning and who writ several Treatises very much cried up by  Photius  I have not said a Word here of  Lasthemia  the  Mantinaean  nor  Axiothea  the  Phliasian  tho' they are mentioned amongst the Disciples of  Plato  by  Diogenes Laertius  and I own I forgot  Hipparchia  whose Life he writes and commends both as a Philosopher and a Writer of Tragedies and  Hedyle  the Poetess whom  Athenaeus  quotes and  Vossius  mentions neither of these two in his  Poetis Grecis  Vossius  it seems has forgot them as well as I I question not but there are several others whose Names we want and I question not but there are several named whom I remember not However this is enough to let you see we are not so hard put to it as you imagine since one little Country can furnish us with all these What say you Sir are you yet satisfied there are Women of Wit and Learning or shall we fetch you the  Quintil L  Cornelia  you mentioned  Salust  Bell Catil  Sempronia  Vossius  de Poetis Latin  for the rest  Cornisicia Polla Argentaria  the Wife of  Lucan  and who assisted him in his Poem  Sulpitia Proba Falconia Helpine  the Wife of  Boetius  from among the  Latins  Or if these are not enow shall we bring up our Reserves of  Italian Spanish French German  and  English  And if you are not yet contented because I fancy every Body else is I shall refer you to  Jacobus a Sancto Carolo  's Library of Women illustrious for their Writings or to  Anna Maria Schurman  who was indeed a Library herself since you mention her Pardon me Sir if I detain you a little longer than ordinary with this Woman and though you may think it lost Time because you knew it before yet it is possible every Body does not know that she was very well skilled in the  Hebrew Chaldee Syriac Arabic Turkish Greek Latin French English Italian Spanish German Dutch  and  Flemish  Languages that she had a very good Faculty at Poetry and Painting that she was a perfect Mistress of all the Philosophies that the greatest Divines of her Time were proud of her Judgment in their own Profession and that when we had this Character of her she was not above thirty Years of Age What think you Sir is not this Woman sufficient of herself Or shall we refer you to Mademoiselle  L'Egalite des Deux Sexes  Gournay  among the  French  or  Nobilità delle Donne  Lucretia Marinella  among the  Italians  who have both writ in Defence of their Sex and who are both Arguments themselves of the Excellency of it I shall not as much as mention any of those Ladies whose Wit  Balzac  and  Voiture  so much admire I shall say nothing of the Mesdemoselles  Scuderie  and  Le Fevre  to the first of which we do not only owe several excellent Treatises published under her own Name but who is said also to have had a great Share in those that appear under her Brother's and to the latter of which we are obliged for so many admirable Versions and judicious Observations upon most of the  Greek  and  Latin  Poets I shall not as much as trouble you with our own CountryWomen I shall say nothing of Sir  Thomas More  's Daughters about whose Education  Epist ad  Budeum  Erasmus  has written I shall pass by Sir  Nicholas Bacon  's who were as learned as they shall say nothing of Sir  Philip Sidney  's Lady  Pembroke  nor as much as mention Mrs  Philips  or any of the rest of our  English  Poetesses but I can hardly forbear saying something of the Lady  Jane Gray  of whom all Nations else speak and whose Fame is  more celebrated in  Italy  both for her Learning and Piety by the Account that  Michael Angelo  has given them of her than it is here at home Should I reckon up all those Ladies whose Wit and Learning has been celebrated by our own Poets should I but enter upon the Praises of Queen  Elizabeth  of  England  or  Mary  of  Scotland  in that Particular I should never have done But I can hardly omit two Ladies who are Strangers and however I am straitned for Room yet methinks I ought to be just to those who were civil to me since therefore I received particular Favours from the Procurator  Cornara  during my Stay at  Venice  let me not pass over in silence his Daughter for whom most of the greatest Princes and Learned Men of  Europe  have testified such an Esteem This Lady besides her Skill in  Rhetoric Logic Music  and  Astronomy  writ and spoke perfectly well seven several Languages and made the Course of all the speculative Sciences with so much Success that she might very well profess herself a Mistress of them and all this before she was thirty Years of Age Her Sister whom I had the Honour to see she herself being dead some Time before is likewise a Person of very singular Endowments and all this whilst they are one of the best Families of a Town where  the Nobility seem almost as proud of their Ignorance as their Liberty The other I shall mention is  Christina  Queen of  Sweden  a Princess whose Accomplishments are so generally known that it is enough to have named her a Lady of that true Judgment that she knew how to esteem Wit and Learning at the same Time that she despised Crowns and seemed to be born as a sufficient Recompence to the Commonwealth of Letters for all the Mischiefs her Predecessors the  Goths  and  Vandals  had done it before I am satisfied it is impossible for me to add any Thing to a Glory so established as that of this Princess is yet as I never passed any Time either with greater Benefit or greater Satisfaction than what I passed in her Conversation so I am very well pleased methinks with any thing that gives me Occasion to call it to my Remembrance There might be as advantageous Characters perhaps given of some Ladies of our own Country now living did not their Modesty that inseparable Quality of Wit and Women deter me from it  We might tell you farther Sir that this Modesty too often hinders them from makeing their Virtues known That they are not of those eternal Scriblers who are continually plagueing the World with their Works and that it is not the Vanity of  getting a Name which several of the greatest Men of the World have owned to be the Cause of their writing that is the Cause of the Womens Had not  Sapho  been so much in Love it is possible we had never heard any Mention of one of the greatest Wits that ever was born had not  Cicero  and  Quintilian  given us Accounts of  Cornelia  and the Daughters of  Laelius  and  Hortensius  they had never done it themselves had not  Jane Gray  been put to Death her Virtues had never been so much taken notice of had not the  Portugueze  Nun been deserted by her Gallant we had missed some of the most passionate Letters that these latter Ages have produced and had not  Anna Maria Schurman  's Works been published by a Friend without her Consent we had lost the Benefit of them We may tell you too that it is not only in respect of their own Sex that they are admired but even of ours That of those two Odes we have yet of  Sapho  we owe one to  Dionysius Halicarnassaeus  the other to  Longin  the two best Critics of  Greece  who chose them out for Examples to their Rules before any of the Mens That the Epistle of  Sapho  to  Phaon  which is esteemed the most delicate of  Ovid  's is supposed to be taken out of her Writings That  Corinna  was five Times  victorious over  Pindar  the best Lyric Poet of our Sex And were we here in  England  as forward in printing Letters as they are in  France  and  Italy  we might furnish Volumes of them written by our own Ladies that would make all the Womenhaters blush or make all Men else blush for them  Here  Madam  I must own to you I grew jealous for I could not imagine that PHILOGYNES would have said this without having seen some of your Ladyship's Letters  We may tell you too that granting the equal Capacities of both Sexes it is a greater Wonder to find one Learned Woman than a hundred Learned Men considering the Difference of their Educations If you should go into  Greece  and seeing the Ignorance is among them at present tell them their Countrymen were incapable of learning would you not be very well satisfied when they told you of the  Platos  and  Aristotles  of Antiquity And that if they had not as famous Men now it was because they have not the same Advantages they had then And pray why may not the Women be allowed the same Excuse Will you by your Laws and Customs endeavour to keep them ignorant and then blame them for being so And forbid all  Men of Sense keeping them Company as you do and yet be angry with them for keeping Company with Fools Consider what Time and Charge is spent to make Men fit for somewhat Eight or Nine Years at School Six or Seven Years at the University Four or Five Years in Travel and after all this are they not almost all Fops Clowns Dunces or Pedants I know not what you think of the Women but if they are Fools they are Fools I am sure with less Pains and less Expence than we are  Upon second Thoughts I hope Sir you will allow that Women may have Wit and Learning for their Courage and Conduct we may possibly say more anon But for Heaven's sake do not aggravate their Faults always at that Rate for whatever  Sapho  's Life and Conversation were there is nothing in her Writings but what represents the most tender and delicate Passion in the World And as for  Aloisia Sigaea  I give you Thanks for putting me in mind of  Vasaeus  Chron Hisp  Thuanus  Aloisia Sigaea  who was as remarkable for her Wit and Learning as any of the other I am very well assured you do not believe that infamous Book which goes under her Name to have been written by her  Vid Eloges des hommes illustres de Monsieur de  Thou  all who speak of it assure us the  contrary and that she was so far from writing it that she  Vid Biblioth Hispan  never published any Thing On the other side all Historians represent her as remarkable for her Virtue as her Learning For the Queen of  Sheba  there is no mention in Scripture of her Travelling for any Thing but to be satisfied with the Wisdom of  Solomon  however if you will believe she went to him for the same Reason that  Vid  Quint Curtius  B  Thalestris  did to  Alexander  the Great it was no such great Matter in Countries where is was thought no Sin if the one had a Mind to have a Child by the wisest Man in the World and the other by the bravest After all we must own if there are lewd Women they endeavour to conceal their Lewdness they do not brag of it nor fly openly in the Face of Religion and if they once come to be publicly discovered they are rendered infamous to all the World and their nearest Friends and Relations avoid their Company Whilst there are several Men who boast of their Iniquities value themselves upon their being thought lewd and what is worse find others to value them upon it too nay by their Incitements and Encouragements to Wickedness often bring themselves to that Pass that the least  Part of the Sins they are to answer for are what they have committed themselves But not a Word more I beseech you of  Sapho  nor her new Crime let  Lucian  be forgotten for putting us in mind of it and let it be cloistered up within the Walls of a  Turkish  Seraglio I speak not this in Behalf of the Female Sex but of our own for if they should once hear of this Argument and fall upon us with  Socrates  was in Love with  Alcibiades  Socrates  Plato  writes Verses to  Aster  a Boy with whom he was in Love  Plato  and all those Heroes of Antiquity whom  Plutarch  and  Lucian  produce in Defence of a like Sin in our Sex should they mention  Anacreon Tibullus Martial  and all those Poets who have eternized their Infamy in their Writings and after that shew you what Progresses this Crime has made not only in the  Turk  's Dominion but even in  Spain  and  Italy  I am sure Sir you would wish you had said nothing of a Point that may be so severely made use of against our selves  Now tho' you are pleased to quote the Lampoons yet you think as well as I that such Things are not worth any bodies takeing notice of we both know there are a sort of People about this Town who please themselves with Defamations One of these  if they see a Man speak to a Woman make their little Signs their politic Winks and possibly when they meet him in their insipid Way of Railery tax him with it If he is angry at them then he is piqued and afraid the Intrigue should be found out If he says nothing as it deserves nothing then he is out of Countenance and cannot say a Word and if he laughs at them which is all the Answer a Man would make to such Stuff then he is pleased with the Thing so that every Way the poor Lady's Reputation suffers and these Sparks shall not fail to blow it about Town that there is an Amour not that they think so of you but that you may return the Compliment and say so of them when they speak to any Lady themselves  For their Garrulity if you would see Things which are against you in that Treatise of  De Garrulitate  Plutarch  from whence you bring two of your Instances you might have been furnished with enow of the Mens But tho' it is lawful to forget Stories that are not for you yet methinks you ought to tell out those you do mention and when we have heard that the Wife of  Fulvius  seeing what she had done shewed her Husband the Way to avoid the Consequences of it by stabing herself first we must certainly  own that such a Woman had Virtue enough to make Amends for all her Faults And if in Answer to the Instances you bring I should mention the  Plutarch  de Clar Mulierib  Melitish  or the  Saxon  Women who tho' they were all engaged in Plots with their Husbands yet not one discovered it If I should shew you  Plin  B  Plutarch  de Garul  Leaena  at  Athens  or  Tacitus  Annal B  Epicharis  at  Rome  who being both engaged in Plots one against the Tyrant  Pisistratus  the other against  Nero  yet could not by all their Tortures be brought to discover them and that the former for fear her Torments should make her reveal it bit off her Tongue certainly Sir you would have a better Opinion of their Taciturnity But we need not go so far for Instances our own Country and our own Time will furnish us with enow In all the Plots we have had continually on foot tho' we have had Women engaged and accused tho' there was one pilloried in the first three executed in another and sixteen or seventeen excepted in a General Pardon though there have been several seized upon like Accounts since yet you see there has not been one of them who ever made a Discovery  Give me leave Sir to commend them for their Virtues at the same Time that I am far from defending their Faults and though I have a very good Opinion of those Men who discover a Conspiracy upon Remorse of Conscience yet I must take leave to believe that there are some at least who do it upon another Account and without any Sorrow at all for their Design except that it did not succeed think to save their own Lives by the Sacrifice of other Peoples and make Amends for their Treason against the Government by their Treachery to their Friends  But no Wonder you are so severe upon the Faults of modern Women when you fall upon those whom all Antiquity has reverenced It is hard that  Jael  and  Judith  whose Actions have been so long admired should be called to Account for them so many thousand Years after It would be an Injury to their Cause to say any Thing in their Defence and a Presumption in me to justify Actions that the Scripture has celebrated so much But must poor  Penelope  fall under your Displeasure too I am sensible how much she is like to suffer who is defended by so dull a Fellow as  Homer  against those most ingenious Gentlemen who are the Lampooners of our Age However as their Ability in  Scandal needs no foreign Aid and as I am satisfied they would think it a Disparagement to them to be reckoned with  Virgil  and  Ovid  let us free them pray from such unworthy Companions For the former I believe you are fully satisfied the  Priapeia  are none of his and as fully satisfied that the Authority of such sort of Verses is not extreamly much to be depended upon And for  Ovid  if in the Person of a Bawd who he tells you was a Liar he gives you a Reflection upon  Penelope  yet he makes her very sufficient Amends when  Penelope  mansit quamvis custode remoto  Inter tam multos intemerata procos  OVID Amor L  El  he speaks in his own Person And taking the Story as it lies that her House was always full of Lovers whom she could by no Means get away  Laertes  being too old  Telemachus  too young to encounter them it certainly shews her Virtue so much the more For as there is no great Courage required to keep a Fortress in the Time of Peace so a very little Virtue is sufficient to preserve that Chastity which no Body ever thought it worth his While to attempt Now if  Lycophron  and  Duris Samius  represent her as a lewd Woman as I understand not how they should come to know it all  the Writers who lived before them giving so very different an Account so for  Lycophron  it is no great Wonder a  Greek  and a Poet should lye or that  Duris Samius  seeing the Etymology of the Word  Pan  come so pat should feed us with a Story upon it of his own Invention  Pan  you remember  Madam  in  Greek  signifies All and who would not tell a Lye for so pretty a Conceit You may observe also that this Author was not of so established a Reputation as  Cicero  would make us believe since  Life of  Alcibiades  Plutarch  who quotes him once does it only to contradict him in a Point of History that he ought to have known better than this For  Lucretia  observe of Sir  Charles Sidley  as of  Ovid  before that he only makes the Bawd say it and if you consider the Fear in which she was you will find that that Passion often makes People run into a greater Danger to avoid a less of which you have Instances enow in our own Plantations of the  Ligon  's History of  Barbados  Fol p  Slaves who hang themselves to avoid their being beat  After all this Sir if you still think with  Le Chambre  that Men have a greater natural Inclination to Virtue than Women yet I hope you will grant they have taken a very becoming Care to overcome that Inclination  and if Nature has not given so large a Talent to the other Sex yet they have improved that Talent much better than we have done ours Then for your Instances of some few ill Women I tell you as I did before that the Cause in general is not at all concerned in them and when I shew you an  Atreus  cutting his Brother's Children in Pieces and giving them to him to eat a  Phalaris  roasting People alive in a brazen Bull a  Busyris  murdering all his Guests a  Nero  ripping open the Womb of his Mother to see the Place where he had lain and so for every Crime of that Sex shew you how far they have been outdone by some of our own as that  Lucretia Marinella La Nobiltà e l'eccellenza delle Donne  on deffetti e mancamenti degli Huomini  Italian  Lady I mentioned does in her Treatise upon a like Occasion I am sure you will find a very great Disadvantage of your Side But I take you at your Word let us go a Circuit with the Judges and if you find not six Men condemn'd for one Women I will pay the Charges of the Journey It is true indeed as most of the Women who are condemn'd are so for a Crime which they commit to prevent their Shame so the Care of that and Hypocrisy are two Faults of which out Sex is not so generally guilty Now though  I do not think myself obliged to say one Word for any one of those Women you have condemned and shall therefore leave  Phoedra  and  Fausta  to your Mercy though neither of them expected the Cruelty of their Husbands should have carried Things so far and shall not argue much for  Semiramis  though certainly her having all the Bravery Wisdom and Virtues of our Sex in the greatest Perfection might move you to forgive her the having some of our Faults and for her putting Men to Death I am contented that every one who boast of Ladies Favours should be served in the same Manner Here Madam I cannot at all agree with  Philogynes  because it might be severe upon some honest Gentlemen whom all the Laws against Adultery and Fornication would never reach Yet methinks I have an Inclination to say somewhat for Queen  Joan  of  Naples  because she is generally represented so very ill The common  Essais de  Montagne  L C  Story is that having married  Andreossa  an  Hungarian  and her Kinsman and not finding him so capable of satisfying her as his Youth and Beauty promised she caused him to be strangled in a Silk Cord of her own making The first and chief Author of this Story is  Villani  a  Florentine  for  Istoria di  Napoli  L  Collenuccio  takes it from him though as such Things use it has lost nothing in his Hands who tells you that he had it from a  V Annotazione e Supplimente al Istoria di  Collenuccio  per  Costo  Relation made to his Brother by a certain  Hungarian  who had been a Servant of  Andreossa  's and in his Return to  Hungary  passed through  Florence  Now the Author of this Story being an  Hungarian  one of those of whom  Petrarch  writes so much ill and also a Servant of the dead King he ought to speak passionately against the Queen of whom they were professed Enemies You may observe also that the  Inordinata vita praecedens retentio potestatis in regno neglecta vindicta vir alter susceptus excusatio subsequens necis viri tui te probant fuisse participem consortem  Letter which  Lewis  the Brother of  Andreossa  writes to her at the Time that he came with a potent Army to revenge his Brother's Death speaks of her being privy to it as a Thing that was suspected rather than a Thing that did plainly appear On the other side  Casi degli Huomini Illustri  Boccace  who lived a great while in that Court throws all the Blame of the Action upon the Conspirators and none at all upon the Queen After all believe as you please and do as you please with all these Women who have  offended you If  Helen  runs away from  Menelaus  let all  Greece  arm and fetch her back again If  Clytemnestra  consents to the killing  Agamemnon  let  Orestes  kill her for it If  Semiramis  puts the Men she has made Use of to Death let her own Son serve her in the same Manner If  Joan  of  Naples  causes  Andreossa  to be strangled let  Durazzo  cause her to be strangled in the same Place Let not your Severity stop there but let their Infamy live when they themselves are dead and let the  Euripides  's the  Juvenals  and the  Misogynes  's set out their Actions in their true Colours But let the Business go no farther I beseech you Let not  Hecuba  nor  Andromache  suffer because  Helen  is a wanton Woman nor  Penelope  be run down because  Clytemnestra  is an ill Wife and if  Joan  of  Naples  strangles her Husband let not all those who have died for theirs fall under the same Condemnation It is one of the chiefest Ends of Punishments to distinguish the Good from the Bad do not you therefore by Punishments confound them If  Tibullus  and  Ovid  's Mistresses jilt their Lovers let it be remembered against them two thousand Years after and if  Misogynes  's serve him so let him shew his Resentment in as severe a Manner as he pleases Let him disdain the mean Revenge of malicious  Whispers and nameless Lampoons and the much meaner Way of railing at all because one has injured him but let him boldly hunt her out from the Herd let him publish her Infamy in lasting Characters though she is free from Conscience let her be plagued with the Stings of Shame and let all Women be terrified by her Example from being false to Men of Wit or kind to Fools But let him have very full Satisfaction of the Matter of Fact first let him not go upon dubious Grounds nor jealous Surmises let him not believe the Vanity of some nor the Malice of others let him consider the Stories of  Orlan Furioso Canto  Bradamante  in  Ariosto  of  Aurestilla  in  Consalo de Cepedes  of  Othello  in  Shakespeare  and let him see how far Jealousy may seem reasonable whilst nevertheless the Person of whom they are jealous may be innocent After all I give you even in that greater Power than I should care to take myself I would rather by other Peoples Faults correct my own and should think the noblest Revenge a Man could take upon a Woman who injured him would be the doing some Action that would make all the World admire him I would have every body upbraid her with my Wrongs whilst I myself was silent It is true if by the Injuries she  did me there were any Aspersions cast upon my Reputation there Justice to myself would oblige me to make the Story public But I would certainly endeavour to reclaim her by Mildness before I made Use even of that Severity and as I should scorn any Favour that was the Effect of Fear so if I once broke into an open War all the Submission she could make should never bring me to an Amity again though perhaps my own Goodnature might in Time prevail upon me for a Forgiveness  This Sir is what I thought necessary to reply to what you said in which I see we have quite exceeded the Bounds of a Dialogue and turn'd that into Declamation which was intended only for Conversation I have troubled the Company so much already that I dare trespass no farther upon their Patience and shall therefore omit some other Things which I intended to have said upon this Occasion  You are like those People cry'd  Misogynes  who when they have provided all the Dainties they could get make an Apology at the End of the Treat for their having got no more If I am not altogether convinced of the Goodness of your Cause yet I am very well convinced that you have said all the Cause will bear  Tho' perhaps I should have no great Mercy upon you replied  Philogynes  yet I have too much for these Gentlemen to detain them so long as to hear all that I could say upon so glorious an Occasion Should I make a Collection of what is written by the best Authors of Antiquity in their Praises should I but refer you to what  Stobaeus  has collected for them since you mention what he has done against them should I but transcribe what  De Claris Mulier  Plutarch  De Foeminâ Christian  Lodovicus Vives  Dialoghi delle Donne  Speron Sperone  the most Learned of his Countrymen  De la Gloire Immortelle des Dames Illustres  Ribera  Eloges des Dames Illustres  Hilarion de Costè  Femme Heroique  Scuderie  and a thousand others have said of them in Treatises written expresly in their Praises should I but search all the Bibliotheques for a Catalogue of those who were famous for their Writings Should I afterwards tell you of those who were remarkable for their Piety conjugal Affection Penitence and Contempt of worldly Vanities should I but repeat the Names of  those who have died for the Preservation of their Chastity should I shew you a  See  Bernier  's History of  Indostan Tavernier  's and  Mandelso  's Travels  Country even at this Day where they cannot by any Severity hinder Women from burning themselves with the Bodies of their deceased Husbands Should I mention the Women of  Plutarch  de Clar Mulieribus  Cios  amongst whom for seven hundred Years there never was the least Mention of any Adultery or Fornication should I tell you that the first of those Sins was so little known amongst the  Spartans  that they did not think it worth their while to make any Law against it Now said my Friend whether this were not as good an Argument of the Mens Chastity as the Womens I leave you to judge but really I think not  Madam  for besides Intrigues with their own Sex which were common enough amongst the Men in those Eastern Countries I do not doubt but the Men being Men of Honour would ask though the Women being Women of Honour would deny Should I but give you a List of the Martyrs of that Sex from those who suffered under  Tiberius  to those who suffered under our own Queen  Mary  I fancy I should make you ashamed of your  Simonides  your  Juvenal  and all your Satirists  put together Should I after this defend them in the Virtue to which they are thought to have least Pretences which is Courage should I but name those who have been famous for their warlike Atchievements should I tell you of  Deborah Penthesilaea Thalestris Camilla  should I shew you a Country  See  Acosta  's History of the  WestIndies  of  Amazons  even in our own Time Should I carry you into  France  and shew you a warlike Virgin at least an unmarried Woman whose Memory is still annually celebrated by one of their chiefest  Orleans  Towns and who besides her Fame in their Chronicles has given a Subject to one of the most famous  La Pucelle  de Monsieur  Chapelaine  Heroic Poems which that Nation has produced would you not after all confess they might very easily be defended even in this Point too But I shall wave that I am satisfied with the Care universal Custom has taken of them and as Seamen in a Storm to preserve their Things of greatest Value throw away those of less so I am very well pleased that Mankind should be exposed to the Hazards of War whilst the Fair Sex is preserved in Safety at Home whose Smiles are the noblest Reward a brave Man can  desire for all the Hazards and Fatigues he has endured in a Campagne  But it is generally agreed that all Virtues are requisite for those who govern well and since there are some Countries where Women are excluded from the Throne and no Country where they are not postponed it would be convenient methinks to see what they do when by Accident they are placed upon it I shall not trouble you here with  Deborah  nor  Esther  nor as much as mention  Semiramis  though you have mentioned her upon another Occasion and yet certainly the Bravery of most of her Actions ought to make us forget the Faults of some few but I shall confine myself within the Bounds of our own Country  Tacitus  in Vita  Agric  and from him  Sammes  in his  Britania Illustratá  At a Time when the  Britons  groaned under the Servitude of the  Romans  when the King by thinking to oblige the Emperor gave him an Opportunity of pillaging his Country and that their Patience under their Sufferings was only a Means of making them more When their Houses were robbed their Wives and Daughters ravished and their Sons taken away from them then  Boadicea  arose and by her Courage as well as Eloquence inspired  her dispirited Countrymen with a Resolution of throwing off that Yoke which was grown intolerable to be born It is true indeed the End was not answerable to the Successes of the Beginning nor to the Glory so heroic an Undertaking deserved however as it was neither Want of Courage nor Conduct in her so we ought to render her that Veneration which is due to so resolute an Enterprize  But as one of the greatest Attempts the  Britons  made for their Liberty was whilst they were led by a Woman so we must own the greatest Glory our Nation could ever boast was under the Government of one of the same Sex It was in the Time of Queen  Elizabeth  that this Island arrived at that Pitch of Greatness to which it had been ascending for several Ages and from which it has been declining till very lately ever since It is the Name of this Princess that is dearer to all  Englishmen  than the Names of all the Monarchs since the Conquest besides and the only one whose Birthday has been celebrated after her Death by the voluntary Gratitude of the People  But however we may forget Things that are past let us not oversee that which lies before our Eyes and since the Occasion is so very fair I know not how we can omit the shewing our Sense of those Virtues of  which the whole Nation has demonstrated so grateful an Acknowledgment by the Body of their Representatives and never were they more truly their Representatives before Yes Sir without going to foreign Countries without searching the Histories of our own we have even in our own Time and our own Country a Princess who has governed to their general Satisfaction a People the most curious to pry into the Faults of their Governors of any People under the Sun A Princess who though she never shewed any Fondness of Vainglory or Authority yet when the Necessity of the Kingdom called her to the Helm managed Affairs with that Dexterity which is very rarely found in those who are the most ambitious of Command Every Thing during that little Time of her Government was ordered with that Courage Conduct and Prudence that her greatest Friends cannot find Eloquence enough to commend nor her greatest Enemies the least Pretences to condemn Though she had a Husband venturing his Life in another Country with a Bravery equal to what has made us suspect the Stories of Antiquity tho' our Fleet the Bulwarks of the Nation was managed in a Manner the Courage of the  English  Seamen was utterly unacquainted with tho' a  Monarch who thinks himself able to contend with all  Europe  together seemed to make his utmost Efforts against a Princess who had nothing but the universal Hearts of her Subjects to defend her tho' all Christendom was in Suspence to see the Event of the Undertaking and every little Prince had forgot his own Danger to contemplate hers even at this Time did we see her look with all the Unconcern imaginable and whilst every Body else was alarmed for her Safety she only seemed to have known nothing of the Danger Not that this Unconcern proceeded from any Ignorance of her Condition or unreasonable Contempt of her Adversary no she provided against their Attempts with all the Prudence could be wished for at the same Time that she looked upon the Danger with all the Courage in Nature  But however great these Virtues may appear when they are set off by the Lustre of a public Command yet they are in Effect much greater when they teach People to despise all such dazling Trifles Here it is Sir that we have a fresh Field for Eloquence when we see a Lady dissatisfied at that Glory which she had to every Bodies Satisfaction beside and grudge herself that Authority which she owed to the Absence of a Husband whom she loved so much  better than that What think you Sir of that Alacrity of that Joy with which she resigned up the Government Does it not put you in mind of the old  Roman  Generals who quitted their Plough to command an Army and when the Victory was gain'd returned with greater Content to their Plough again This is that Wisdom which we should admire this is that Virtue which we should adore and we ought to despise all those little Pretenders to Business who thrust themselves into the Management of Affairs against every Bodies Will but their own and having neither Virtue nor Prudence enough to retire from it at the universal Murmurs of the People are generally made Sacrifices at last to the just Resentment of an enraged Nation  These are those blazing Comets whose fatal Glories portend Destruction to a Government whilst the Virtues of the others like those of the Sun give it Life and Heat by their benign Influence Much more Sir might be said in  Defence  of the  Sex  which I shall purposely omit because I am satisfied I can never conclude with a more illustrious Example  AESCULAPIUS  OR THE HOSPITAL of FOOLS  AN Imitation of  LUCIAN  By WILLIAM WALSH  Esq  AESCULAPIUS  _MAKE the  Third  Proclamation  Mercury  MERCURY  OYes OYes OYes Whereas daily Complaints are made by all the World of the innumerable Follies of Mankind by reason of which they are neither happy themselves nor will suffer others to be so The great  Jupiter  out of his fatherly Compassion to Mankind has sent  Aesculapius  to apply Medicines to them Whoever therefore there is that is troubled  with  Folly  of what kind  soever  let him repair hither and he shall be cured without any Fee  AESCULAPIUS  What shou'd be the Meaning of this Every particular Man complains of the Follies that are in the World and when we come hither to apply Medicines to them there is not one Man that offers himself to be cured  MERCURY  If I might be allowed to advise  Aesculapius  in Points relating to Physic I would tell him there is one Thing in this Disease of  Folly  different from all other Kind of Diseases which is that the Men can easily find the least Symptom of it in other People yet there is no Man that perceives the greatest in himself I think it therefore advisable to make Proclamation that every Man should give Notice of what other People he knows who are troubled with this Disease  AESCULAPIUS  Let it be as you say  MERCURY  OYes OYes OYes Whoever has any Relation Friend or Acquaintance  that is troubled with  Folly  of whatever Kind let him bring him hither and he shall be cured without any Fee  AESCULAPIUS  See see What Crouds are getting together Every Man seizes his next Neighbour without any Deliberation at all and they come willingly too because every Man seems ready to accuse the other  First  MAN  Here Sir I have brought you a  Fool  to be cured  Second  MAN  Pray Sir take  this  first for he is  dangerously ill  Third  MAN  Take Pity upon  this  good Sir for he has a  Complication  of  Folly  upon him  MERCURY  Pray Gentlemen have a little Patience You shall be all cured one after another  First  MAN  Nay for my Part I have no Occasion for myself  Second  MAN  How no Occasion Neighbour I wish for your own sake you had not For my Part indeed  Third  MAN  Prithee good Neighbour hold thy Tongue What  cuckolded  and  henpecked  and pretend to be free from  Folly  AESCULAPIUS  Mercury  Keep the Croud off with your  Caduceus  and bring the Patients up in Order  MERCURY  Stand off there Gentlemen and do not press upon us so Here you old Fellow come in here with your Patient Make your Reverence to  Aesculapius  and tell him what you would have  Old  MAN  An't please you Sir this young Man is a Kinsman of mine He came very young to a great Estate half of which he has made a Shift to squander away already and he is in great Danger of doing so by  the rest in a short Time if you do not cure him of his  Folly  I have taken a great deal of Pains in advising him but all in vain If he could not live upon his whole Estate I asked him how he hopes to live upon the Half And if he spent his Estate when he was young and able to get one what would become of him when he was old and past getting one But when I talk to him he laughs at me and that is all the Thanks I have for my Pains  AESCULAPIUS  Mercury  put him in the Hospital Care shall be taken of him  Young  MAN  I desire Sir that you would please to hear me first and judge whether it is this old Man or I who have most need of your Medicines I confess indeed that what he says is true But pray consider that I spend this Estate in pleasing myself and were it not a great  Folly  to debar myself of Pleasure for the  present Moment  which is all I am sure of for fear of not having Means to enjoy them in a  future Time  to which I have no Security that I shall ever arrive But granting I were certain of Life Is it not a Madness to waste all my Youth which  is the only Time we are capable of Pleasure to lay up Wealth which we are to make Use of in an Age when we are not capable of any Pleasure at all But this old Man who has the Confidence to accuse me does ten times worse He did not only heap up Wealth all his Youth but he continues to do so still and though his Age and the Infirmities of his Body give him hourly Notice that he can hardly live one Year longer yet is he at his Usury his Extortion and a hundred Ways to hoard up Wealth as if he were to live ten Thousand Years  AESCULAPIUS  A very palpable  Folly  indeed  Mercury  put him aside too  Young  MAN  I did not doubt Sir but that I should convince you at last I may go away now  AESCULAPIUS  How Friend Does that Man's being a  Fool  hinder you from being a  Fool  too If it be a  Folly  in him to  heap  up Money that he can never probably live to  spend  Is it not a  Folly  therefore in you to  squander  away that Money which probably you will  live to want Take Care  Mercury  that they may be both put in the Hospital  MERCURY  It shall be done In the mean time here are some others  AESCULAPIUS  Well Gentlemen what have you to say  First  MAN  This Sir is a Friend of mine an honest goodnatur'd Man as lives but he has a  Wife  who makes him the greatest  Fool  in Nature and though she abuses him in the grossest Manner imaginable insomuch that half the Town laugh at him yet is he himself blind to that in his own House which any Stranger sees Here is  one  who has been often found with  her  and who can tell you more if you examine him  AESCULAPIUS  Well Sir and what can you say  Second  MAN  All that I can say Sir is that the Gentleman is a very worthy  Gentleman  and his Lady a very fine  Lady  He has often  indeed bragg'd to me of the Happiness of a marry'd Life I thought the best Way to find out this Happiness was in going to his Lady who has fully convinced me of all her Husband said But as I have a perfect Friendship for the Gentleman I must confess Sir I am as well satisfied with his having a fine  Wife  as if I had  one  myself  AESCULAPIUS  He has a fine Time on't the mean while  HUSBAND  I confess Sir I have nothing to say in Contradiction to these Gentlemen All that the one says and the other would insinuate may be true for aught I know nor do I think it much worth my While to enquire after it Half the Town the first says laugh at me for being a  Cuckold  and he would have me make it public that the other Half might laugh at me too But pray let us consider how much wiser he acts He marry'd a  Wife  who by the way is not extreamly taking and yet you cannot imagine what Care what Contrivances what cunning Stratagems this wise Person made Use of to search out a Thing which after all he did not care to  find And though with all his Bustle he could find out nothing that really made against her yet he has cast her off with Infamy and Shame chiefly indeed to himself for using a Wo man ill who never gave him Occasion for it If there be so many who laugh at me for a tame Husband let him hearken after his own Concerns and he will find a much greater Number who rail at him for a base and illnatur'd one  Now for this brisk  Monsieur  here for this  finished  Gentleman who can with so much Delicacy rally the poor  Fools  that  marry  So very ingenious a Person no doubt acts much more wisely himself Lord how is his Estate divided One Part upon Taylors another upon Milliners a third upon Perfumers a fourth upon Perriwigmakers All his Time spent between the Toilet the Playhouse the Park and DrawingRoom And upon what noble Design pray is all this Time and all this Money wasted Even Gentlemen that this most charming Person of his may attain that with all this Cost which I received Twenty Thousand Pound for doing Would his Niceness be contented with the Meat that had been tumbled and cold upon my Trencher Truly Sir his Happiness is little more than  this I that am the  Fool  come to her when I will stay with her as long as I will and command her as I will while this wise Gentleman is waiting a frosty Night under her Window breaking his Brains for Songs and Billets for her bribing her Women losing his Rest and venturing the being abused kicked down Stairs and having his Throat cut whenever he happens to be found out  AESCULAPIUS  Very great  Fools  truly all  Three  Is it not strange  Mercury  One would think every Man wise when we hear him talk of  other Peoples Concerns  and yet we find them all  Fools  when we look into their own  MERCURY  Alas  Aesculapius  how should it be otherwise when a Man is told of his  Folly  he does not consider whether it be true and endeavour to mend it He only considers whether the Man who tells him of this be not guilty of some  Folly  too and if he find he is as I doubt we shall find few who are not he rests as well satisfied in laughing at him as if he were absolutely free from all sort of  Folly  himself  AESCULAPIUS  Well old Gentlewoman What is it you have to say against that young Man  Old  WOMAN  An't please you Sir this young Man is my Husband He made fair Pretences to me before Marriage but now he neglects and despises me for every other Woman Now I appeal to you Sir and to all the World whether it be not a very  great Folly  for a Man to tye himself during Life to a Woman he does not love  AESCULAPIUS  Yes without doubt it is  Mercury  put them both up  Old  WOMAN  An't please you Sir it is I who make the Complaint  AESCULAPIUS  Very good Mistress And if it be a  Folly  in him to marry a Woman that he does not love was it not a  Folly  in you to marry a Man without knowing first whether he loved you or no  MERCURY  Here are several other  Wives  who complain of their  Husbands  and  Husbands  who complain of their  Wives  AESCULAPIUS  Put them in all without farther Deliberation For though People may be allowed to be as critical in their Choice as they please before Marriage yet when that is once done it is a great  Folly  to complain  MERCURY  Here are a vast Quantity more of both Men and Women brought upon Account of their Marriage  AESCULAPIUS  It were an endless Work to hear of every one who play'd the  Fool  in Marriage To save Time therefore we will put up all the married People at a Venture and if there be any one who can give us satisfactory Reasons to prove that he did not play the  Fool  in it we will let him out again  HUSBAND  No Sir I will not go in No one can say I committed any  Folly  in marrying  AESCULAPIUS  How Friend marry and commit no  Folly  What Wife have you pray  HUSBAND  One who has Wit Beauty Virtue Riches and is of a very considerable Family  AESCULAPIUS  It is very much to be suspected that thou art guilty of  Folly  in having this Opinion of her A Woman with Wit and Beauty marry an odd disagreeable Fellow and not cuckold him However Friend if it be so you may go away but be sure you send your  Wife  in your Place  HUSBAND  Do you reckon it a  Folly  then in a Woman not to  cuckold  her Husband  AESCULAPIUS  No Friend we do not tell you so But when a Woman who finds by her Constitution that she shall make any Husband a Cuckold takes one who is very fit for that Purpose there are some wicked People who think she does as wisely as a Woman  in her Circumstances could But when a Woman marries a Man who is fit for no other Use than to make a Cuckold of without a Design of putting him to any Use that that Woman commits a  Folly  there was never any one yet could doubt  MERCURY  But see what vast Crouds are waiting for Audience and with how much Eagerness are they set upon discovering the  Follies  of one another It is impossible for us to hear all the particular  Follies  of which particular Men are guilty It seems to me therefore by very much the easiest Way to pick out the wise Men first and when we have done that we may apply general Medicines to the rest without enquiring farther into their particular Distempers Make Proclamation therefore  Mercury  that People may no longer trouble themselves with bringing the  Fools  of their Acquaintance but henceforward let them bring none but the  Wise Men  MERCURY  Alas  Aesculapius  Art thou no better acquainted with the Nature of Mankind than this Believe me if we stay here till one Man accuses another of being wise we  may stay till the End of the World No  Aesculapius  no In searching the  Follies  of Mankind it was necessary to have an Account of them from others and not from themselves But if you would search for  Wise Men  you must not ask Mens Opinion of one another but take what every Man thinks of himself  AESCULAPIUS  Thou art better acquainted with the Humours of Mankind than I am do therefore as thou wilt  MERCURY  OYes OYes OYes Let all those that are  Wise  range themselves upon the Right Hand and distinguish themselves from the rest  AESCULAPIUS  What is the Meaning of this Every Man places himself on the Right Side but one and they jostle one another for Room with the greatest Violence imaginable Here you Sir What are you pray who appear so very confidently in the very Head of the Wise  POET  Who I Sir I am a  Poet  AESCULAPIUS  Well and pray Mr  Poet  what Pretence have you to place yourself so confidently before all the rest  POET  Can  Aesculapius  know I am a Poet and ask that Question As much as a Man is above a Beast so much is a Poet above another Man It is we who converse with the Gods and despise the rest of Mankind It is we who elevate ourselves above the transitory Things that the Vulgar are fond of who despise Riches Glory and Honour and seek for nothing but Fame and Immortality  When conq'ring  Death  shall ravish from their Eyes  Those trifling Glories that the  Vulgar  prize  When Crowns shall fall when  Empires  shall be lost  And all that's  mortal  be dissolv'd to Dust  Then shall  I live  immortal in my Fame  And future Ages shall extol  my Name  In several Places of Mr  Pope  's Works it will be found that he has  a most ardent Thirst after  Immortality  STATESMAN  I think there is no great Need of convincing  Aesculapius  how little that Man deserves the Title of Wise since he himself has been pleased to prove it sufficiently already I will not say any Thing to the Man himself or enquire what Pretences he has to the Title of a Poet but taking it for granted that he is as good as he fancies himself yet can any Thing be so ridiculous as the very Design he proposes He does not pretend that Poetry makes People happy in this World because we very plainly see the contrary but he pleases himself with a vain Reversion of imaginary Honours that he is never to enjoy till he himself is insensible of them It will be a very great Satisfaction doubtless to a Man when he is in the Grave to think his Verses run as smoothly as ever and one must be an Infidel to doubt but that the Author of a fine Poem will be extreamly considered in the other World  I do not say this out of any Malice to the Profession of a Poet nor would I pretend to take a Title from them though they do not deserve it but in order to shew you those who do Do you ask me then who it is that deserves the Title of a  Wise  Man  Whom should I answer but him who knows how to  govern  the  State  If particular Persons of a Community think they have any Title to Wisdom how much more must they allow that Title to those who are capable of governing the Community It is they certainly who can move Assemblies who can advise Kings who can govern Commonwealths that deserve the Title of the  Wise  How considerable a Figure does such a Man make in a Government How much is he followed and caressed What Advantages does he get to himself and Family And how much is he flattered and adored by these very  Poets  who would vainly arrogate the Title of  Wise  to themselves  Such has been the  quondam  Advice of Mr POPE's  Lelius  alias  Saint John  alias  The Examiner  STOIC  Though I am of a Profession that do not trouble themselves with the Trifles of the World yet I cannot I confess be pleased to see People take a Title to themselves to which they have not the least Pretence I might observe here that considering how Kings are for the most part advised and Commonwealths governed a Man has no great Reason to boast of his having a Hand in either But I shall wave all that as to  my Particular and speak to the Employment of a  Statesman  in general Is there then any Thing so ridiculous as for a Man to propose the making himself Great as the End of all his Actions The only End a Wise Man proposes is the making himself happy how ridiculous then must he appear who makes himself miserable in order to make himself Great Who seeks the Contempt of the Wise that he may get the Admiration of Fools Who leads a false dissembling Life fawning upon those who treat him insolently and treating those insolently who fawn upon him Who values himself upon the bearing other Peoples Burdens for which the only Thanks he gets is Envy or Contempt Envy if he succeed and Contempt if he fail Should a Man who came late to an Inn instead of taking the Rest that was requisite to refresh him for the next Day's Journey enter into Cabals form Designs and manage Intrigues to get the best Room in the House which would make him very uneasy if he fail'd of it and from which tho' he succeeded he must necessarily depart the next Morning would not this Man appear ridiculously foolish and contemptible to all the World And when we see a Man in a World from which he must necessarily depart in a very short Space of Time instead of preparing  himself for what is to follow waste all that little Time in senseless Cabals in vain Designs and in ridiculous Intrigues to make himself Great and Powerful which if he do not attain it makes him uneasy and which if he do he must leave immediately again Is not this Man ten Times more ridiculous and more foolish than the other The Man who by his Folly loses his Rest one Night will without doubt grow wiser and take a double Share of Rest the next But alas in the other Case it is quite different there is no second Opportunity of correcting the first and he who has spent  one  Life foolishly will never be trusted with  another  to employ better  AESCULAPIUS  Wisely urged O incomparable  Stoic  The Folly of this sort of Men is very palpable and you certainly who can so sagely find out their Infirmities can easily discover to us the Men who are subject to no Infirmities at all  STOIC  You judge right divine  Aesculapius  it is among us and only us that you must expect to find a real Wise Man And our Leaders have taught us upon a due Consideration  of the World to pronounce all Men Mad beside 'Tis true their Extravagance does not appear perhaps to the Vulgar but as in a Madhouse one of the Patients does not perceive  that  Madness in his Companion which is presently found out by a sober Standerby So in this  universal  Madness which possesses the World in general tho' they do not discover it in one another yet it is at first Sight apparent to the Eyes of the Sage Do you ask me then who is this Wise Man that I have mentioned It is he who places not his Felicity in his Beauty his Wealth or his Learning who desires no Pleasure who fears no Pain Whom the Frowns of Fortune cannot deject nor her Smiles exalt Who is happy in Prisons in Banishments in Torments Who if he were broiling in  Phalaris  's BULL would cry out  How pleasant is this  It matters not how many Arrows Fortune aims at him since he is impenetrable to them all As there are some Stones so hard that the Iron cannot touch as Diamonds can neither be cut nor broken but resist the strongest Force as Rocks in the Sea break the Fury of the Waves and beaten upon so many Ages retain no Marks of its Rage so is the Soul of a Wise Man solid and firm and has collected so much Strength that it remains as safe from all  Injuries as any of the Things I mentioned But what will you say is there no one then who will attempt the injuring a Wise Man Yes they will attempt it but they cannot perform it He is elevated so much above the Vulgar that none of their ill Designs can arrive at him When that foolish King darkened the Day with his Arrows there was not one of them which reached the Sun when the Chains were cast into the Sea they could not bind the Waves and those who destroy the Temples do no Injury to the Divinity In like Manner whatever is done proudly maliciously or insolently against a Wise Man who is in nothing different from a God but in Point of Time is but attempted in vain  AESCULAPIUS  O sage O wonderful O incomparable  Stoic  This this is a Wise Man indeed Is it possible that People can continue Slaves to their  Follies  when Wisdom proposes such sublime such noble Rewards to her  Followers  But descend a little from this high Region in which you are placed conform yourself to the Weaknesses of others and convince their Stupidity by living Examples of this high Pitch of Wisdom you have so nobly described to them But what  is the Matter with that Man to laugh so You there who  stand by yourself  on the  left  Side while all the rest are gotten upon the  right  MAN solus  Alas Sir who can forbear laughing to see Men hope by their Pride and Vanity to exempt themselves from those Infirmities to which all Mankind are naturally subject This sage this wonderful this incomparable  Stoic  after all his noble and highflown Similies is neither so hard as a Diamond so firm as a Rock nor so elevated as the Sun This mighty Man who would laugh in  Phalaris  's BULL yet is liable to Pain and Anguish as well as the meanest of the People the most vulgar Weapon shall hurt him and the most ordinary Strength shall reach him This contemplative Person who has found out the  Follies  of  all  Mankind has  one  of his  own  that he does not see ten Times more extravagant than any of  theirs  Since there is no Folly sure so extravagant as for  one  who labours under all the Frailties and Weaknesses and Infirmities of  Mankind  to think himself in any wise comparable to the Perfection of a  God  AESCULAPIUS  Well Friend what are you then who dare accuse the  Stoics  of Folly who accuse all the World beside  MAN  Alas Sir I am a  Fool  too and am so well convinced of it that you see I keep by my self on the  Left  Side when all the rest go to the  Right  and were I not convinced my self I have given sufficient Reason to convince any one else by troubling myself with correcting the  Follies  of  others  while I have so many  Follies  of my  own  that are uncorrected still  AESCULAPIUS  What are become of all the Wise Men then are there none left  MAN  If you take every Man's Opinion of himself never were there so  many  if you take their Opinions of one another never were there so  few  AESCULAPIUS  Are all Men then alike  MAN  No there are some who are called  Wise  and some who are called  Fools  not but that the wisest Man has a sufficient Stock of Folly too But the best Method I can propose to distinguish Mankind is by calling those Men  Wise  who know themselves to be  Fools  and those Men  Fools  who think themselves to be  Wise  AESCULAPIUS  Mercury  thou art a swift Messenger haste away to  Jupiter  inform him of what we have done and know his further Pleasure in the Matter You may tell him that upon a full Survey of Mankind it appears that every one has such a  sufficient Share of Folly  that he has no Reason at all to complain of his Neighbours having more That in Answer to those who think their Folly obstructs their Happiness it is very plain that the Happiness of Mankind is so complicated with this Folly that it is impossible to cure them of the one without endangering the other too Should we convince the  Fool  who squanders away his Money that he might live to want it should we convince the  Fool  who heaps up Treasure that in a little Time he must die and have  all his Treasure taken from him should we convince the  Husband  who places his Happiness in his Wife and Children that the one cuckolds him and the other are none of his should we convince the  Man  who does Things to be eternally famous that after Death he will have no Sense of Fame or of whatever is said of him we should make them all miserable and wretched On the other Side by taking away their Folly we shou'd take away one of the most useful Qualities in the World since it is very evident that Mankind live upon the Follies of one another Were there not  Fools  who sell Estates what would become of the  Fools  who buy them Were there not  Fools  who marry human Kind would come to an End Were there not  Fools  of Business how would the  Fools  that meddle with no Business be managed Were there not fighting  Fools  who would protect the  Fools  that would not fight from Oppression And were there not  Writing Fools  what would the  Reading Fools  do for a Diversion So that upon the whole Matter I think we had even as good leave the World as we find it However if he thinks there ought to be somewhat done in this Matter after having made so much Noise about it the most general Folly in Men being that of shewing Severity to other  Peoples Faults while they neglect those they commit themselves He may order a solemn  Proclamation  to be made  That no Man shall have the Privilege of censuring the Follies of other People till he can bring a Certificate under the Hands of three judicious Neighbours that he has none at all of his own  LETTERS BETWEEN

Maid  To thee our tributary Sounds are paid  TO THOMAS UVEDALE  Esq  SIR  THOUGH I receiv'd your generous Present two Days after the Date yet the Affairs of my Parents and the Commands of a noble Lady  Lady  Delawar  have harrass'd me so much that I could not get Time to return my Thanks sooner I doubt you'll quickly be convinc'd you have formed a very unjust Idea of me for I protest on a SelfExamination I can't find one of those good Qualities you lay to my Charge However 'tis highly obliging in you to fancy me ingenious and agreeable 'till you know the contrary as such I accept the Compliment and acknowledge your uncommon Candor The Question now is Whether I ought not to stop here and preserve your favourable Opinion by my Silence rather than hazard it by a farther Discovery of my Ignorance The first is certainly most prudent but the latter being more just I think it a Point of Honour to undeceive you and dispel the false Charms of an imaginary Prospect Your  American  Simile  would have been proper enough for me but I can by no Means allow you to make Use on't neither can I admit of a Barter so exceedingly disadvantageous to my Correspondent No Sir I'll preserve your finish'd Poems as a Standard of good Verse but I shall not pretend to traffic with you because I never wrote any Thing that pleas'd myself and surely if an Author can't satisfy her own Judgment 'tis in vain to expect she should please others  I hope you'll be contented with this Answer because 'tis Truth and I hope also that if I should not send so quick a Return to your Letters as you may expect or as they deserve you will not presently accuse me of Disrespect for what with the continued Weakness of my Grandmother and the necessary Concerns of Life I have so little Time at my own Disposal that I dare not promise a constant Correspondence lest I should engage for more than I can perform I conjure you by your most beloved Muse never more to call any Thing of mine  excellent  since in my Opinion  unmerited Praise  is no better than  civil Lampoon  I should pity your hard Fate in living among such  unsociable Animals  did I not believe that a  wise Man  scorns to be beholden to  Fortune  for a precarious Happiness and that you are this  Philosopher I no more doubt than that you imitate the  Elder  SCIPIO and improve your  Lucky Idleness  However since you seem too Modest to own the Happiness you find in  Solitude  and again think fit to descend to Complaint I will also confess that I join in your just Resentments for I have had the same Account of the illnatur'd  Wintonians  by another Hand and am now sensible that what I took for a  Satire  was no more than a  Character  well  drawn  But is it possible the Inhabitants should be all of a Piece Is there no shining Exception no generous Mind who has Fortitude enough to resist the malignant Particles of its native Air Yes yes you will confess I know you will that Mrs  Martland  has Learning Virtue Wit and good Humour sufficient to atone for the Vices Folly and Illnature of a much larger City than  Winchester  How then can you complain of  Solitude  or how can you call that Place dull where our  English  SAPHO resides SAPHO was the Name Mr CROMWELL chose for her and not undeservedly her excellent Verses requiring a nobler Epithet if the Records of Time had afforded it I know not whether you have the good Fortune to be acquainted with this incomparable Lady if you are and find a convenient Opportunity I would  intreat you to give her my best Respects and to assure her that I have been many Years very ambitious of subscribing myself her unfeign'd Admirer I have also another Request which is this that you would send me the Title of that Book wherein is DURFY's Lampoon on Mr DRYDEN's Marriage or do me the Favour to transcribe it from your own Memory I am  SIR  Your most humble Servant CORINNA  LONDON  April  To Mrs THOMAS  MADAM  INstead of convincing me that I have form'd a very unjust Idea of you your last Letter has but the more confirm'd my Opinion of your Worth and Goodness and tho' an Unwillingness of owning the shining Qualifications of your Mind and the distinguishing Character of true Merit has conjur'd me never to use the Word  excellent  for any thing of  yours  yet I must and will say that I never saw any of your Writings but what deserv'd that  Title  neither can I admit of your excusive Arguments for solid Reasons why you should deny me the Advantage and Satisfaction of a  Poetical Merchandise  but only take them to be a modest Refusal of my Offer upon the Account of my Insufficiency to become your Correspondent in so precious a Commodity as  Verse  Tho' I have been somewhat slow in answering your Letter yet do not accuse me of Disrespect or Negligence since it is not design'd as a premeditated Silence for indeed I have been seiz'd with so severe a Fit of Melancholy that for the Space of ten Days I have not had  the Heart to apply my Mind to any thing but the unsociable Companions of an uneasy Being Sorrow and Discontent and how long it would have continu'd upon me had not the prevailing Thoughts of Fair CORINNA rous'd me from that Lethargy of Temper I cannot well determine Stupidity and Insipidness are the Epidemical Distempers of our Town therefore it is no Wonder that my Spirits naturally prone to Dullness should so soon catch the reigning Contagion LUCIUS FLORUS in his  History of the Second  PUNIC WAR gives us an Account how HANNIBAL in his Nonage was sworn ROME's  eternal Foe  In like manner do I verily believe that the  Wintonians  in their Infancy fretfully resolv'd to be everlasting Enemies to Mirth and Sense for at the least Appearance of either they start like wild Beasts at FireArms and raise all their Posse of Malice and Illnature to suppress whatever bears the Face of Wit or Diversion Tho' I am a Stranger Madam to Mrs  Martland  's Perfections yet since you are pleased to bestow so high an Elogy on her Learning Virtue Wit and Goodhumour I believe her to be an extraordinary Lady and on your Commendation am very desirous of her Acquaintance but how to introduce myself to her is the Point for  you must know that our  Ladies  here like  Snails  keep every one in their own  Shell  and are wond'rous shy of Men Visitants How far a Person of such fine Notions and such an exalted Mind as the  Elder  SCIPIO was might improve the Minutes of a solitary Retirement I am not able to judge but sure I am that one of my slender Understanding destitute of Books and ingenious Conversation can reap no other Advantage from a Country Life than what DOMITIAN  did from killing of Flies  passing away time in an idle Employment Whatever Pleasures that renowned  Hero  found in Solitude were certainly owing to his Choice but my Retirement is only the Result of invincible Necessity which gives a Tincture of Bitterness and Disgust to all the Pleasures of a rural Life I am concern'd that my Memory cannot oblige you with neither the Title of the Book nor the Lampoon on Mr DRYDEN's  The Piece here referr'd to was not  Durfy  's but written by a Nobleman and may be found in the Works of the Earls of  Rochester Roscomon  and  Dorset  in Volumes mo Printed for  E Curll  It is intitled  Satire to his  Muse  by  the Author of  Absalom  and  Achitophel  and begins thus  Hear me dull

hector'd into Marriage  c  Marriage  for either 'twas never heard of or else wholly forgotten by  MADAM  Your most Humble Servant THOMAS UVEDALE  WINTON  May  THE Mosaic Creation  WHEN first the starting Hours with fleeting Pace  O'er Time's eternal Plain began their Race  The wise Creator with his Hands did rear  The Fabric of this beauteous Theatre  The wond'rous Frame of Heav'n and Earth arose  At his Command and did their Forms disclose  Th' expanded Earth was one continu'd Void  'Till his creating Pow'r its Strength employ'd  No Form the hudled Mass of nothing bore  But gloomy Marks of wild Confusion wore  Clouds of substantial Darkness to be felt  On the brown Face of unshap'd Nature dwelt  Th' Almighty's Spirit on the Waters play'd  And all his heav'nly Energy betray'd  Th' Eternal spake Let smiling Light convey  Around th'Abyss an unaccustom'd Day  Strait from the Region of tremendous Night  Dawn'd forth in ruddy Streaks primaeval Light  Its orient Beams e'en charm'd th' Almighty's Sight  Then by his Pow'r a Separation made  Between the lovely Light and beamless Shade  The streaming Light was call'd refulgent Day  The Darkness Night and sunk in Horror lay  And when the Ev'ning and the Morn came round  Thus far th' Almighty's  First  Day's Work was crown'd  Again the Godhead spoke Let strait appear  A Firmament amidst the Waters clear  To part the Streams with an officious Care  Soon a new model'd Firmament was seen  Divide the Waters with its lucid Screen  So in distinguish'd Channels calmly move  Waters beneath the Sky and those above  Then by his Mouth the sacred Name of Heaven  Was to the newcreated  Aether  given  And when the Ev'ning and the Morn came round  The Labour of God's  Second  Day was crown'd  Then from his Throne thus said the Pow'r supreme  Let all these Waters make one flowing Stream  Which roll beneath the vast Aetherial Mold  And let one Place their liquid Troops infold  That the dry Land may shew its recent Head  And with extended Force its Beauties spread  No sooner spoke but the dry Land appear'd  And from the Deep its barren Forehead rear'd  The Name of Earth th'unmeasur'd Land possess'd  As that of Sea the congregated Waves express'd  The spacious Forms his Pow'rful Hands had made  With secret Pleasure did his Mind invade  Once more th'Eternal spoke Let teeming Earth  Disclose a sudden and prolific Birth  Let grassy Burdens load the naked Plain  And useful Herbs in verdant Triumph reign  Let FruitTrees bearing Fruit in Vigour grow  Which on the Years their Product may bestow  And let the pregnant Seeds of ev'ry Kind  To every Herb and every Tree assign'd  With springing Grass the Fields were cover'd o'er  And Herbs which in themselves their Seedings bore  In stately Rows the spreading FruitTrees stood  Bearing their proper Seed and God pronounc'd it good  So when arriv'd the Ev'ning and the Morn  Thus far his Work the  Third  Day did adorn  Jehovah  said let glorious Lights display  Their beamy Splendor round the heav'nly Way  Which may distinguish Night from chearful Day  Whilst in its Orb each shining Spark appears  For Signs for Seasons and revolving Years  When strait with Lights the Crystal Plain was spread  That on the Earth their dazzling Lustre shed  Two Lights immensely great he form'd in haste  Which in the Skies were to Advantage plac'd  The greater Orb to rule the burning Day  The less amidst the Shades of Night to stray  And from the darken'd Space its Beams convey  To these the Stars with twinkling Lustre bright  He added to adorn the Face of Night  High in the Azure Roof they took their Place  With their fair Rays this under World to grace  So when the Godhead saw how all Things stood  His awful Voice declar'd the Labour good  And when the Ev'ning and the Morning clos'd  The  Fourth  Day's Work in Order was compos'd  Again th'Almighty spoke Let now the watry Field  Unnumber'd Shoals of moving Creatures yield  With a vast Product of the feather'd Kind  To fan with various Wings the buxom Wind  Huge Whales he form'd the Monsters of the Deep  And Creatures which on Earth's low Surface creep  With springing Fowls that wing the airy Steep  Each in themselves their proper Kind contain'd  That all was good his sacred Tongue explain'd  Increase and Multiply the Maker said  And o'er the Earth be fruitfully convey'd  Full to the Brim the foaming Ocean lade  And let the num'rous Fowl the Land invade  So when the Ev'ning and the Morn roll'd on  The  Fifth  Day's Labour was compleatly done  Jehovah  said Let th' obsequious Earth  Produce a mingled instantancous Birth  Of Cattle creeping Forms and Beasts of Prey  And let their Seed be stor'd in the cemented Clay  Lest moldring Time should wear the Kind away  The furious Herds the shady Forest trace  Low grov'ling Reptiles print the flow'ry Space  And ev'ry Creature fill'd his proper Place  Th' Eternal look'd and saw 'twas wond'rous good  'Cause all Things in a just Decorum stood  Thus from his Seat th'Almighty did declare  Let us make MAN whose nobler Form may bear  Our heav'nly Image and our Likeness wear  And let the finny Race and ev'ry Drove  With Beasts that round the globous Ball shall rove  And those whose Belly sweep the dusty plain  Confess him Lord and own his pow'rful Reign  In his own Image God created Man  As Male and Female join'd his Hours began  The Father Hand pour'd wond'rous Blessings round  And with unmeasur'd Bounty they were crown'd  Increase be fruitful and the Earth subdue  The Maker said this Pow'r is given to you  Rule with unrival'd Sway the scaly Land  Beast Fishes Birds each living Thing command  The Lord went on Behold to you I've given  The Use of ev'ry Herb that's under Heaven  And ev'ry Tree that beareth Fruit for Food  Pleasing to Life and to the Palate good  To ev'ry Beast that roams the Forest round  And ev'ry creeping Thing that crawls the Ground  With all the winged Flocks the wholesom Herbs whose Green  Is with an everlasting Verdure seen  With this sweet Grass they may their Hunger ease  And all its meagre rav'nous Troops appease  Then God survey'd the finish'd Globe with Care  And lo the Work appear'd Divinely fair  So when the Ev'ning and the Morning came  The  Sixth  Day's Light smii'd on the glorious Frame  Lady CHUDLEIGH TO Mrs THOMAS  YOUR various Styles of  Cross  and  Kind  Recals a  Custom

Persons to great Houses where the Garrets are generally the worst furnish'd  I must confess however they have an Advantage which the others wants they are pleas'd better cheap and as they have less Delicacy they find no Difficulties to their Satisfaction For it is certainly a Misfortune to have a Taste too refined for the Age one lives in and to spin such Cobweb Notions of Excellence as 'tis

Deanry of  ChristChurch  OXON  Translated from the  Latin  Original See VOL II    _MOST Excellent Youth this your Reception of me in the Entrance of your Court with your obliging Oration is truly acceptable I rejoyce not so much that I am as that this House is adorned thereby which has always been esteemed the Nursery of ingenuous Education and I am with Pleasure induced to believe that your Cotemporaries are in all Things like yourself In which Expectation if I am not deceived you may with Confidence assure yourselves of such Incouragment and Rewards as I have Power to bestow  Your Congratulation select Batchelour and that of your Society is the more pleasing to me for that it proceeds from those who are grown up to a Maturity of Judgment enlarged and perfected by the Precepts and Instructions of Philosophy and other various Kinds of Learning I wish I was altogether the Man which I understand from you they take me to be He I truly am who with the utmost Satisfaction behold a Learned Body of young Men happily pressing after whatever is praiseworthy and who cannot therefore but greatly encourage the growing Commendation of your House I know I shall hear much concerning your Love of the profound Sciences the commendable Course of your Studies and the Progress of your Learning from that worthy Man the SubDean of this House whose Vigilance and Industry if I can any ways assist he will find in me when Occasion offers an active Sharer of his Care and Counsel  Most Eloquent Reader of Rhetoric you indeed shew yourself well fitted to that your Province which you have sustained for many Years with Reputation when having so slender a Subject to work upon you dignify and enlarge it with a plentiful Flow of Words and all the forceful Charms of Eloquence Both I myself am but too  conscious and you notwithstanding the great Things you say of me cannot be insensible how little I deserve these Commendations yet with what Ingenuity and Modesty do you treat me when not judging it convenient to admonish me publickly you have Recourse to those Rules of your Art which say That an Exhortation is then most effectual when you extol him whom you mean to excite If any therefore led away by this Kind of Speech should imagine that the Virtues recited are mine great is his Mistake it was designed to a different Intent that whilst you thus discharged your own Duty you might remind me of mine and your whole Endeavour was that the Auditors of this Panegyrick might understand not who I am but what he ought to be that has the Honour to preside in this flourishing College who being placed over so numerous a Body of those already Learned and others yet a Learning should be ever mindful to defend the Cause of Religion cultivate good Manners and promote sound Literature truly a very difficult Undertaking however you shew me the Way to make it easier for even at this Instant we cannot but remember those worthy Men my Predecessors in this Trust from which Remembrance you readily hit upon all those Perfections required  to compose a Picture highly finished of the Greatest Man and the most Skilful Governor  However when I think of filling this Post now fallen to my Lot and consider my own Abilities there arises a Dread and Diffidence sufficient to confound and overwhelm me nor am I ever so dispirited or out of love with myself as when  Fell  and  Aldrich  those two great Luminaries of your Commonwealth of Letters present themselves to my Remembrance for who has not Reason to dread treading in the Paths they trod who being endowed with the choicest Gifts of Nature furnished with a great Variety of Arts exercised in a long Tract of Academical Employments brought this House which ever had its Share of Glory ever illustrious for its Praise of Learning to the utmost Pitch of Splendor and Perfection  Both of them were eagerly studious of Knowledge and earnestly disposed to cultivate the liberal Sciences Both of them were possessed with extraordinary Candour so as to cherish every Appearance of Virtue that presented itself ever interpreting favourably and to the milder Sense whatever bore the Face of Doubt Both of them were noble and generous not carried away with the Thirst of Riches or of Honours  They were careless of their private Affairs but vigilant for the Public Good No Man ever loved his Family more ardently or cherished it with more Affection than both of them did this House No Man's Country was ever dearer to him than this University to them By their own Labour by their own Cost to increase the Art of Printing to repair to rebuild these Walls as it was always a Care to them so was it a Pleasure With these Thoughts with these Desires were they employ'd when living nor was there any Intermission to the Hour of their Deaths You are not unacquainted with the Things I speak of which so lately were and still are in your Sight and Hearing but be they rivetted ever so strongly in your Minds the Repetition of them will always be a Pleasure and the Remembrance of them delightful who excelled in every Qualification that could be in Man The Image of that most humane Man can never be forgot by me or you by whose Demise this House as tho' it were deprived of a Parent now lies in Mourning and in Sorrow God grant that now by my coming among you it may in some measure be refreshed and comforted To him nothing was wanting which indulgent Nature could bestow either to the propagating or Embellishment of Learning nothing  which could excite either the Love or Admiration of those over whom he presided What Perspicuity what Strength of Thought what a ready Utterance was he endowed with applying himself to different Kinds of Learning with Ease and Quickness Never at a Loss nor a Stranger to any Sort of Literature that was laid before him Whatsoever he undertook in any Art was performed to Exactness so that one might say he was alone born for that Part which he then sustained and that all his Time and Labour had been imployed therein Whether he followed more serious Studies or delighted himself with those of less Consequence whether he treated of divine or moral Subjects you could not perceive which he was more capable to perform this or that But then in his Address and Conversation in his Recess and Business how genteel was his Behaviour how plain and open was his Mind What Integrity in his Life what Truth in his Words what Modesty in his Countenance what Gracefulness in his Front Adorned with these Gifts of Nature that which often seems morose and severe in abstrase Learning he was wont to allay with a wonderful Pleasantness so that he could mould and form the Minds of young Beginners not barely by his Precepts and Instructions  but by his Aspect and engaging Manner to the Love of Learning and all the Praises of Humanity In this Man were many Things admirable many Things excellent but nothing more so than that he held the Memory of blessed  Fell  in singular Regard and Veneration looking upon him and declaring him to be the unerring Guide and Pattern of all his public Actions the best Master for the Instruction and Government of Youth a Restorer of that Discipline which was interrupted amongst us in the Times of Distraction and in a Word the Guardian Establisher of this spacious Building And truly ever since a Way was opened for the Return of true Religion and sound Learning to this Place from whence it was driven Whatsoever this House hath contributed to the Help of Science or the Increase of Piety whatsoever Benefit hath accrued from it to the Church or State all flows from the Labour Care and Counsels of that most holy Prelate By him was laid the Foundation of our Praises by him were sown the Seeds of Virtue Industry and Learning which even now flourish and which from him both living and dead hath so often ripened into a plenteous and joyful Harvest  As often therefore as I consider this Body still flourishing by the Instructions of  Fell  methinks I see that well planted Field which  Cyrus  formerly shewed  Lysander  where if I may say so one might admire the Height Ranks and regular Disposition of Trees the Ground cultivated smooth and clean with the sweet and flagrant Odor wafted from the Flowers but above all the Diligence and Industry of him by whom they were thus planted and designed  Happy that Husbandman of ours who can truly say with  Cyrus  All these have I thus disposed mine is the Order the Design is mine many of these Trees have I also planted with my own Hands for the Benefit of this and perhaps of the coming Generation To me therefore in the Discharge of this Office shall I say it was a Happiness or a Misfortune immediately to succeed such eminent Men what now remains but that I who am diffident of my own Abilities should rouse myself up by the Contemplation of those Virtues with which they excelled and that those best of Masters whom I profitted by when living I should copy after when dead and look on them as Examples to be followed in all Things according to my Ability  They truly by their excellent Endowments obtained this that they were singularly serviceable to you which I too well  know I can never attain to There is one Thing however which I boast to share in common with them It is a certain unspeakable Degree of Love and good Will which I bear towards this House by which I have at Heart you and all your Interests In this I trust never to be outdone by any of those my Ancestors with some of whom in nothing else am I worthy to be compared  On the DEATH of that Excellent Young Man Mr

were you less  But wou'd go thither wheresoe'er you went  An honourable Death to share  Or noble Banishment  III  No Laurels no Rewards attend this Verse  It is too honest for the World's Applause  Be it my Wealth to weep upon thy Hearse  My Glory ever to defend thy Cause  I boast some Merit 'tis to love thy Name  This is a Privilege no Laws deny  'Tis Laurels Glory Wealth Applause and Fame  And I

CURLL  June the th  SIR  AS you intend to publish the Life of that eminent Antiquary Mr  Thomas Hearne  it is to be wished that it might be compleat and just not in that Manner as it was set out about four Years ago by a  Chaplain  of  AllSouls  College which was intended rather as a  Sneer  upon Mr  Hearne  The Gentlemen herein hinted at is the Reverend Mr  Bilson  who published Mr  Hearne  's Vindication of taking the  Oath  of  Allegiance  the Preface to which is so far from  Sneer  that it contains many judicious  Remarks  and is a full Detection of our Antiquary's  gross  Errors  than to give us an impartial Account of his Life and Writings  Among the Manuscripts he has left is A DIARY of his LIFE interspersed  spersed with many curious Passages Characters and his  whole  Conversation and  Correspondence  till within a few Days of his Death  I am Sir Your Humble Servant PQ  July  SIR  I Received yours much too late and after a solemn Promise to the Gentleman you mentioned not to communicate aught without Permission relating to him This I could not but comply with as yourself well know the Friendship and long Correspondence between us so that I must not contribute but if called upon by any who may hereafter do him the Honour designed by you as I hope nothing else is or that any Thing mean trifling or injurious will be handed into the World  Your c AB  July  SIR  AS to the Gentleman's Character you intend to attack I must desire to be excused if I don't concern myself He is dead and has answered elswhere and how far his Censures are just I know not he cannot now defend himself  De Mortuis nil nisi bonum  As to the Gentleman to whom the MSS are left I will not encourage you or any Body to apply to him By the WILL you'll find he has Directions from the Testator as to that Affair and he is a Man of too nice Honour not to strictly adhere to them so that all manner of Application there will be ineffectual  Your c AB  Our Correspondent  AB  is very tenacious of the Antiquary's Character We hope he will not find any Thing  mean  trifling or injurious  unless doing Justice  To that truly fine Gentleman  Walter Moyle  Esq  may be mistakenly so deemed  As to the good old Caution he gives  De mortuis  c instead of which Mr  Hearne  cries cut  Ad plures abiit  it were to be wished that Mr  Hearne  had had more Regard to it himself but neither he nor his Predecessor  Wood  had any the least Regard either for the Characters of the  Living  or the Memory of the  Dead  the Writings of both being over loaded with Calumny  A Catalogue of Mr  Hearne  's Works is annexed to most of the Books he has published among which we cannot point out any Thing useful unless it be his  Ductor Historicus  and his  Index  to the Earl of  Clarendon's  History  PHILALETHES  THE LIFE OF Mr  Thomas Hearne  _THAT He may never be forgotten who has raked the Repositaries of Antiquity and been indefatigable in fetching Learning from Places where many would not have sought after it a few Memorials of his Life and some Observations on his Writings will we hope redound to his Credit  In the ParishRegister of  Abbots  or  WhiteWaltham  a Village about six Miles  distant from  Windsor  it stands upon Record that he was baptized by the Name of  Thomas  Son of  George Hearne  and  Edith  his Wife on the Eleventh of  June  His Father we have been informed was a considerable Antiquary of the lower Class and was Sacristan of that Parochial Church to the Day of his Death So that Mr  Hearne  in all probability received his great Propensity to the Study of Antiquity as it were  ex Traduce  It is agreed on all Hands that his early Inclination to Letters first discovered itself among the  Tumuli  of his own Parish Churchyard over which he was observed to be continually plodding lmost as soon as he was Master of the English Alphabet To this soon after adding a little Writing he grew impatient after Antiquity resolved never to be unprepared for collecting Materials that might be serviceable hereafter and accordingly stuffed his Diary which was his constant Companion with every Occurrence worthy his Notice This he prudently foresaw would turn to a good Account in his more advanced Years Vacancies in his future Labours might be supplied with a Story from his Journal and tho' it might not  be very methodical or perhaps not at all to his Purpose in Hand yet the Design of preserving it might sufficiently justify its Publication  This was the advantageous Method he pursued all his Life Time He copied  Monuments  and  Inscriptions Original Letters  and  venerable Ballads of Antiquity  Stories of honest  John Ross  and  Peter Langtoft Robert  of  Brune  and St  Thomas Cantilupe  Men who had not Mr  Hearne  lived might have lain for ever buried in an ignoble Obscurity The Preservation of these Things may be ascribed to his  Collectanea  which are now swelled to a prodigious Size  It is difficult indeed to determine to what particular Number these MSS Volumes are now grown because they are kept with as strict and sacred a Care from the Eyes of Mankind as the  See Dr  Prideaux  's Account of these choice  Leaves  in the page of Vol of his  Connection  where we find that none but the Keepers of them were ever suffered to peruse them and They only upon particular Exigencies  Oracles of the  Sibylls  deposited in the Capitol The highest Number we have yet seen quoted by himself is cxxiii in his Preface to the  P  Annals of  John  of  Trokelowe  So that notwithstanding there can be no certain Calculation made of an exact Number yet there is some room for a Conjecture that they are not fewer than five Hundred  Several Passages there are in his  Rob de Glouc  Vol p  XCV Volume which enough convince us of his not being then arrived at Years of Discretion notwithstanding he had filled so many of them If therefore his Industry was as great in his advanced Years as in his Youth which we believe all will allow when they consider the uninterrupted State of Health he all along enjoyed we think we may be allowed not to have exceeded the Number but rather to have fallen short of it This however we only took Notice of to shew what an  inestimable  Loss the World must sustain should this  prodigious  Treasure perish with its  Collector  This Digression we hope the Reader will pardon and so without dwelling on the first eight or ten Years of his Life we shall follow him to the School where we  are told he laid the Foundation of his future Greatness  It was happy for him as well as the  World  that he fell into the Hands of a good  Mr  Gibson  Author of the excellent  Grammatical Exceptions against the late Alterations made in the common Accidence and Grammar  Master at  Bray  School it being a malancholly Thing to consider how many great Genii have either been cramped or utterly spoiled thro' the Ignorance or Indolence of trifling Pedagogues Here he soon mastered the Rudiments of Learning and by a gradual but speedy Progress became acquainted with the  Roman  and  Greek Historians  Thus encouraged by the Pregnancy of his  Parts  his assiduous Industry and Proficiency in School Learning his liberal Friend  Mr  Cherry  of  Shettesbroke Berks  This Gentleman paid for Mr  Hearne  's Education which he has gratefully acknowledged  thought them sufficient Motives to the Continuance of his Bounty and sent him accordingly in the Year MDCXCV with a considerable Addition to the University of  Oxford  Fortune here again if we are rightly informed seemed particularly fond  of him The Vicar  White Kennet  MA afterwards Bp of  Peterborough  of the Parish where his Benefactor lived was at that Time a considerable Tutor in  Edmund Hall  and in the Study of Antiquity most eminently remarkable Thro' this Gentleman's Means he was admitted into this Place and used more like a Son than barely a Pupil by him  A few Years being spent in Academical Learning by the Help of which he had improved his Propensity to Antiquity He gave the World a Specimen of his future Designs In the Year MDCCII but seven Years from his Matriculation he published a copious Index of the principal Passages in Sir  Roger L'Estrange  's Translation of  Josephus  which seems to have met with so good a Reception that the same was reprinted not long after in an Octavo Edition In MDCCIII he obliged the World with or at least occasioned the Publication of the  Reliquiae Bodleianae  or some genuine Remains of Sir  Thomas Bodley  adding the same Year to his other Labours  Pliny  's  Epistles  and  Panegyric  with various Lections and Annotations not to mention his Edition of  Eutropius  with  many other Things published all in this Year In MDCCIV and V came out that laborious Work called  Doctor Historious  in two Volumes  vo  being a short System of Universal History and an Introduction to the Study of it  It would be almost endless to expatiate particularly on his Labours or to give an Account of the Product of every Year for which Reason we must refer the Reader to his own printed Catalogue of them inserted at the End of every Book he published since they became numerous  During this Period however it is observable that his  Vindication  of Those who take the  Oath  of  Allegiance  was written which loudly speaks in the Behalf of Mr  Hearne  's Industry and shews the early Application he had made to Books The many just Quotations in it from sacred History as well as Profane from Acts of Parliament and Lawyers of the greatest Name we flatter ourselves will excuse our writing a Panegyrick and its Author's Name recommend it enough to the Perusal of Mankind  In MDCCIII on the d of  July  he took the Degree of Master of Arts and had  no sooner compleated it but the Eyes of the whole University were upon him His Industry was almost become a Proverb and notwithstanding a little Surliness of Temper which it is thought he brought into the World with him and which probably increased with his severe Studies he met with Friendship in a great many and much Respect from all Men  I should have mentioned indeed before this the Encouragement he had from the  Dr  Hudson  Principal of St  MaryHall  Head Librarian who acquainted with his Diligence made him Underkeeper of the  Bodleian  Library There he had Room enough for his Inquisitive Genius to range in of which he made so good a Use that the Product of every Year afterwards may justly be ascribed to the Acquisitions he had made in this Treasure of Learning  After some Years spent in this Way of printing  Indexes Itineraries  and  Collectanea  his Labours met with an additional Reward being on the th of  Jan  elected  Architypographus  of the University and superior  Beadle  of Civil Law  Leland Collect  Vol p  This we find him acknowledging with Pleasure and Humility to be an Honour which  he took the first  'Opportunity of mentioning to the World on purpose that his Gratitude might be made known to Posterity And notwithstanding he was conscious to himself that the University Favours were conferred upon One who every way undeserved them in respect of Learning and other requisite Qualifications yet still he had very good Reason for accepting them upon this Account amongst others as they seasonably assisted and relieved one of their Members who had for many Years led an obscure and retired Life and was at that Time reduced to a necessitous Condition thro' the great Expence he had been at in carrying on many public Designs'  In this happy Posture of Affairs one would have imagined he might have been easy and satisfied But neither Friendship nor Preferment could put a Stop to his Enquiry after  Truth  Soon after this Promotion he acquired better Reasons to  Himself  at least for NonCompliance with the Oaths which were necessary for  keeping  it than he had before for the  Acceptance  of it and accordingly resigned that advantageous Post which the University had so lately consered on him as inconsistent  with his  Conscience  or at least his Manner of  Thinking  Ever since he steadily adhered to the Principles of a Nonjuror spent his Time in annually obliging the World with something relating to the History of  England  or with some other Affairs as they accidentally have fallen in his Way both for the Benefit and Pleasure of Mankind Here we think he might have been left still labouring at the Oar deserving the Favour and Compliments of the Learned upon his yearly Revival of something as it were lost to every one but himself  Acta Eruditorum Anno p

videor videre  These Passages how much soever they may look like Ridicule to Men who deal only in  Polite Learning  are still undoubted Confirmations of Mr  Hearne  's Industry and will ever be thought so by Persons of  deeper Penetration  Amongst many Qualities remarkable in him his strict and unshaken  Integrity  is none of the least No Regard for any one's Merit could ever prevail with him to connive at their Errors He chose rather to break off the strictest Friendship than to be led aside by it in his Search after  Truth  Nay his very  Gratitude  when it interfered with his  Integrity  was at once renounced as no longer binding  Leland Collect  Vol p  Operae Pretium est  says he  Lectorem monere me nulla alia de Causa à  Richardsono  dissentire nisi quod  Veritatem  aliis quibuscunque Amicitiis anteferendam esse censeam  And in another Place  Alured  p  Ed collineat Operum nostrorum Scopus ut  Veritatem  pro virili asseramus cui litavimus  There is one Thing indeed relating to  University  College to which Society he  Leland Itin  p  declares himselfe indebted which it  would really be a Fault in us not to take Notice of because we are positive his  Veritatis Amor  can never be reconciled with it  During the late unhappy Contest in that House occasioned by the Death of Dr  Charlett  Mr  Hearne  published  Peter Langtoft  's Chronicle at the End of the Second Volume of which he adds a Glossary upon English Words Upon the Word  Writ  he has it thus We commonly understand by  Writ  the same with the Latin  Breve  a written Order or Precept from the King or Court of Judicature by which any thing is commanded to be done relating to Suit or Action  Had he left off here he had done very well  Rob de Avesbury Praef  p    Sed ad Agendum Nati sumus  are his own Words upon which Principle we suppose he proceeded in this Place Of this kind he tells us is that remarkable one relating to  University  College of King  Richard  the Second with his Seal annexed which he just saw and hastily run over  Whether he ever saw this Instrument we shall not scruple at present but whether there is any Seal to it or has been within the Compass of Mr  Hearne  's Years we leave to the Enquiries of the  Fellows  of that Society  The same he tells us was done afterwards expresly by King  Henry  VI in a Writing quoted from the Muniments of the same College by  B Twyne Apolog Antiq Acad Oxon  p    Mr  Twyne  The thing will appear best to the Reader if we produce the Passage printed by Mr  Twyne  and the Translation of it by Mr  Hearne  Nam cum Temporibus  Henrici Sexti  inter  Guilielmum Abbatem  de Osney  Richardum Witton  illius Collegii Magistrum esset Controversia  c And then follows the Instrument itself which is only a common Form in the Case of a LawSuit drawn by some Attorney which Mr  Hearne  without the least Authority whatever makes to be one of these  Writs  or Precepts from the King or Court of Judicature relating to the depending Suit between the  Abbot of Osney  and  Richard Whitton  then Master of the College  How he came to translate  Temporibus Hen  VI  ti  by the  Order  of  Henry  the VIth looks more like  Design  than  Blunder  tho' we would not suggest that he had any Intent of giving a Turn to a Cause then depending in some Measure upon such Instruments as he would have made this  The Annals of this College lately published by Mr  Smith  we find gave our Antiquary some Distaste but upon what Bottom this Anger is raised a little Enquiry if the Reader will permit will soon discover  In his Preface to  Sprott Pref  p    Dr  Sprott  we find this Gentleman a very great Favourite of Mr  Hearne  's whose Character there given is  Vir pereruditus benevolus  But we are afraid his Temper grew four and morose as he advanced in Years In his Preface to the Life of  Richard  II we have another Account of Mr  Smith viz Scriptor ille  ferreus  atque mendax  Gulielmus Faber  de  Joh Rosso  tam maligne passim locutus estHaec in Gratiam  Gulielmi Fabri  Ecclesiae Anglicanae quod vix  credas Sacerdotis qui multum Temporis in isto uno    scil  Antiquitatis  Studio consumsit nuperque jam pene Octogenavius Librum prolixum  Annales Collegii Universitatis  Verbo haud satis apto appellatum Lingua vernacula conscripsit ne dicam conscribillavit in publicum protrusit  We cannot but observe here that Mr  Smith  's Age is made a part of his bad Character when old Age by some more sacred Writers than Mr  Hearne  is thought  honourable  rather than  scandalous  Many other Sentences there are in this Preface which abound with the same sort of Language of this Reverend old Gentleman which the  Veritatis Amor  can never justify  Life of Rich  Pref p  One Passage there is respecting  Sprott  whose Authority we own we have some Reason to scruple which proves that Mr  Hearne  had either not kept up to his avowed Regard for  Truth  or else had unhappily blundered in a Point of Chronology tho' he abused Mr  Smith  for it in the very same Case His Words are these Sprottus  floruit An Dom    longe nimirum citius quam exoptat  Guil Faber  qui  immemor audectar falsoque retulit  Ranulphum Higdenum  primum omnium fuisse qui de  Scholis Aluredianis  aliquid tradidit  c  It is observable here in the fifth place that  Sprott  lived according to Mr  Hearne  's own Confession in which was in the Reign of  Edward  the First that he Studied  in ea parte Aedis Christi quam vulgo vocant Quadrangulum Cantuariense  and that he wrote of  Canterbury College  and left a Book behind him concerning it is evident from the abovecited Preface to  Sprott  's  Chronicle  This is a very surprising  Canterbury  Tale indeed and that would make  Sprott  provided it could be proved more Famous than the  Samian  Philosopher who by the Help of Transmigration passed thro' two or three Successive Stages of Generation but never under the same Name  Sprott  who lived in in the Reign of  Edward  the First studied in  Canterbury College  which was not built till and therefore agreeable to this Account must either have lived about Years before he was born or at least written  of a Place as many Years before it was built  This Mistake we would have accounted for in our Author's Behalf had it been in our Power but as it was not we left it to himself who was better qualified to reconcile Difficulties of this Nature  Another Slip of this kind appears in Page of his Collection of  Curious Discourses Academia  says he  scripsit  Guilielmo Wykham  Episcopo  Winton  ut illis accommodaret Machinas quarum Ope  Scholam Theologicam  Voltis Fornicibus exornarent  It is very well known that the  Divinity School  for which this Loan was desired was built in the Year by  Tho Kempe  Bishop of  London  This Mr  Hearne  allows in the Page preceding the Place before cited  Le Neve  p    William  of  Wikham  Bp of  Winton  died the th of  Sept  so that according to this Assertion the University sent to him  ut illis accommodaret Machinas  c Years after his Death  Rymer Foed  Vol    p    Rymer  in his  Foedera  tells us that  Hen Beaufort  Bp of  Winton  died the d Id of  April  and was succeeded by  William Waynflete  who lived in  Possession of the same till So that if for  Wikham  we read  Waynflete  as the Person petitioned to by the University we shall come within the Time of building the  Divinity School  and set Mr  Hearne  right in his Chronology This we believe was an Alteration of no Design but only a simple thoughtless Blunder Mistakes of this sort we shall conclude with an Assertion of his relating to  University College  where he makes  William  of  Durham  to have studied in the  Great Hall  which was not bought for the Use of  William  of  Durham  's Scholars till Years after his Death  As for the Censure passed upon Mr  Smith  in the Passage abovecited which really is too severe without better Grounds for it we may venture to say it is Unjustifiable For supposing that  Sprott  's Book was written before  Higden  's yet still Mr  Smith  who had never seen or heard of it till he had finished his  Annals  might undoubtedly say and consistent with Truth too that  Ralph Higden  was the first he ever had met with quoted as a Friend to the weak Cause of K  Alfred  's Halls and who seemed first to have introduced this Novelty into the World  Mr  Hearne  therefore in the former Case seems to deserve the Sentence of being  immemor  and int he latter to be very Ungenteel to make no worse of it  Leland Collect  Vol    p    '  Utinam igitur Auctor Noster  to use almost his own Words  Errores expungat Librumque Retractationum ipse confestim edat Crimenque nefandum quod  Clerico huic digno  intulit pro virili eluat Hoc enim non extorsit Veritatis Amor  '  Whilst we are thus impartially considering our Antiquary's Character by setting him right in his Mistakes as well as commending his Virtues one thing occurs which we should have been glad never to have had the Opportunity of correcting About twenty Years before the Publication of the Life of  Richard  II which was wrote by one of the Monks of  Evesham  our Author in his  Leland Itin  Pref p    Preface to the seventh Volume of  Leland  's  Itinerary  expresses a hearty Concern for the just Rights of the Crown in Opposition to those  'who in Order to advance and maintain  Republican Principles  strain  their  Inventions  to give a wrong  Turn  to and  pervert  the  true Meaning  of our best  Historians  and  studiously asperse blacken and desame  the Memory of King  Charles  the II as others with less Modesty have done that of K  Charles  the I What he has said upon these Points he hoped no  Ingenuous  or  Impartial  Person will think  Uncharitalle  or  Unbecoming  These are sounding Words and express a great deal of Loyalty to the Memory of those Princes But such fickle Things are our  Memories  that sometimes they seem to take Pleasure in exposing us Hence doubtless it was that Mr  Hearne  lately run counter to his own abovecited Declarations It must be Forgetsulness we hope so at least that will suffer a Man to draw his own Character in an infamous I Light and whether he has not done it to the Life let the  Reader  judge when he has heard the Accusation and is referred to the Place where he may soon inform himself  At the latter  Pag  End of the Life of  Richard  the d there is a  Letter  printed and Mr  Hearne  says an  Original  one of  Charles  the First when Prince of  Wales  It is directed to the  Duke  of  Buckingham  and interpreted by the  Publisher  of it as carrying on an Affair of Gallantry Be the Letter what it will  Original  or not He ought to have given a better Reason for making it publick He was apprehensive he tells us that if such a  Letter  should be stifled some Persons might interpret it an Instance of Partiality and be apt to make base Reflections upon it Let us examine this kind of Reasoning a little The stifling this  Letter  would have been thought an  Instance  of  Partiality  The Reason of which must be this Because Mr  Hearne  was necessarily obliged to publish every Thing he met with And then he says that some Persons would be apt to make base Reflections on it On the  Letter  we snppose which if stifled they might never see or hear of Or if he meant those Gentlemen who communicated it to him he again forgot his  Veritatis Amor  because they never intended it should be printed That it might escape therefore all  Censure  he published it in a heap of  Appendixes  and  Curae secvndae  and made it a hundred Times more easy for base Reflections to be cast on it than it was before  This is the  Reason  given for publishing this  Letter  In the next Book printed by him which was  Trokelowe  's Annals of  Edward  the d we have an Apology in his Preface for the very same Thing The  Letter  became the Subject of almost every one's Discourse and a Reflection cast upon a Prince remarkable for his  uncommon Chastity  could not but be taken Notice of by many of his Friends Whether it had like to have discontinued any of his Subscriptions or whether he had more maturely considered the Matter we cannot say this however is plain that his  Apology  was designed to give a softer Turn than was hinted in his  Explanation  of the  Letter  and that he had rather have it thought that the  Prince  was unwarily  misled  than  inclined  to this Gallantry  It had been more  prudent  and we may add less  officious  in Mr  Hearne  whilst he was thus endeavouring to clear himself to have first got leave for the Printing this Letter from the  Gentleman  who shewed it him and who we are informed since so highly resents it that he broke off a Friendship with him which had been kept very strict for many Years We must subjoin by the way that it is certainly a greater Instance of  Partiality  to publish a  Letter  as an  Original  which the Editor could not at that Time nor afterwards prove to be so  The  Apology  will appear upon a little Consideration not at all inferior to his  Reason  for printing it especially if we observe that tho' he did not know what the  Intrigue  was yet he happily conjectured by making the  Prince  to be inticed like  Joseph  by the Importunity of a lewd Mistress tho' we do not remember that  Joseph  ever wrote to a third Person about his Affair Nay it may be remarked farther that Mr  Hearne  makes the  This Blunder reached our Author's Ears and in his Preface to  Tho Caius  stands corrected th with some Reluctance For he says it signifies nothing whether it was  Pharoah  's or  Potiphar  's Wife  Wife of  Pharoah  the  importunate  Woman when the Scriptures assure us it was  Potiphar  's Spouse that was so deeply smitten with the Comeliness of the  Hebrew  But a Man may possibly forget his  Bible  who is so very much taken up with  Adam  de  Domerham  and the  black Book  of the  Exchequer  c  Had this unfortunate  Prince  lived some hundred Years before he did Mr  Hearne  's Love for  Antiquity  might probably have  engaged him in his  Defence  rather than in  exposing  him We find him in the  Page  Appendix to  Leland  's  Collectanea  very angry with  Tyrrel  the Historian for staining the Reputation of  Ethelred  and his first  Queen  There he says  'it is a great Crime to scandalize any Person the Heinousness of it increases according to the Dignity of the Person of whom the Scandal is raised But this  says he  may be wiped off by a public  Retraction  '  This was good Doctrine had not a Preface to  Canden  's Queen  Elizabeth  shewed that Men do not always practise as they advise But a public Retractation which from the ingenuousness of Mr  Hearne  's Dposition we had Reason to think he would make might wipe off the Blemish he may have contracted either in the Case of Prince  Charles  or the indecent Language given Mr  Smith  His Pretence to  strict Integrity  we were almost confident would prevail with him to do it in a better Manner than disguising it in a trifling  Apology  and as he was a strict Enquirer after  Truth  and is by this Time convinced it was wrong to publish the  Letter  or abuse the aged  Divine  we do not  doubt but that he retracted what he had said in both Cases and frustrated the Expectations of some People who thought he delighted in  Abuse  tho' we hope he acowledged our  Friendship  in setting him right  Thus have we considered one of his excellent Qualities the next is his  Fidelity  as an  Editor  One Rule which we have been informed he at first laid down and generally speaking closely observed was always to follow his Authors religiously Their Mistakes by this means were punctually copied and sacredly preserved Nay the very Blunders of Transcribers were faithfully penned down for the Amusement of Posterity  Prurigo emendandi ac commutandi a Nobis plane absit  are his own Words in the Notes after the Appendix of  John  of  Trokelowe  's Annals of  Edward  the Second And again in  Leland Itin  Vol    p    Leland  's  Itinerary  he declares that he was so nice in this Affair that  'I observed  says he  Mr  Leland  's Way of Spelling and omitted nothing not so much as the Asterisks and other Notes of that Nature  which had been inserted by him Nor did we leave out even those Words that are plainly  redundant  nor pretend to alter those which are manifestly  wrong  and occasioned by the Haste the Author was in or else by the Defect of his Memory'  This Method is very observable throughout the numerous Volumes he has obliged the World with  Sic MS  he has noted perhaps in the  Margin  to shew that he was not ignorant of the Error in the  Copy Delenda sunt ut opinor  may possibly be seen at the Bottom of one Page and  lege  c at another Here perhaps may be a  Desunt  c and there a  Subintellige  c But still amidst all these Regulations the Text is generally kept  purely corrupt  and scarce a Blunder thro' the whole but what is very industriously preserved Nay so great a Regard had he for the old Way of Spelling that the following  Epistle  which we have printed as like the Original as possibly we could is a standing Proof of it  There are indeed a few Cases in which he has varied from this Rule  History of  Rich  II p  Cur Sec  which might have been concealed  '  had we not been apprehensive  to use his own Words  in another Case  that some Persons  if such Slips should be stifled  might have interpreted it a great Instance of Partiality and made base Reflections upon it  '  One of this Nature we must not pass by lest his Character should prevail as probably it might with some Men hereafter to establish his  Errors  for  Truths  Dr  Hutton  Student of  ChristChurch  about the Year  Dr  Leonard Hutton  in his Antiquities of  Oxford  has quoted a Line from  Shepreve's  Life of  Dr  Claymond  President of  Corpus  Dr  Claymond  concerning a  Shed  which formerly stood in the  CornMarket  built to skreen the Corn from the Weather Upon this there was an Inscription and the Copy from whence he transcribed it had it thus  viz  Ut possit  sircum  Saccus habere locum  In this Verse there appears a palpable Error which a Reader of no extraordinary Capacity might have discovered and corrected But see the Misfortune of not following an old Rule By an unhappy Conjecture he has wandered from his  Copy  and to make  better Sense  of it he has acted the  Critic  's Part and mended  sircum  with  circum  But we think the Alteration of this  Letter  makes but little Difference in the Sense The Lines as we copied them from the Manuscript Life now in the  Musaeum  at  Oxford  run thus  viz  Plebs ubi Rura colens empturis hordea vendit  Aspice quadrifido tecta propinqua foro  Hoc erexit opus talem Claymundus in Usum  Ut  Siccum  possit Saccus habere Locum  Whether this Mistake arose from his not having an Ear for the  Monkish Music  an Error of the like Nature may serve to determine  Antiq Glaston  p    In the

perhaps the  trusting too much to Memory might raise a confused Notion of both Inscriptions and corrupt the  Monkish Jingle  in the former Case  These few Mistakes then having taken their Rise from not sticking closely to his  Copy  we shall take Notice of but One more which was occasioned by following it too closely and it may be seen in his Edition of that valuable  MS Latino Graec  Fol    MS which is said to have belonged formerly to Venerable  Bede  Let it be observed in the first Place that this MS is in very old Capital Letters and each Page divided into two Columns The first contains the  Latin  the  Greek  is wrote collaterally in the other Thro' the  Oscitancy  of the Scribe the  Latin  Sentence is frequently carried beyond the Bounds of its own Column by which means it becomes intermixed with the  Greek  The Text as he has printed it stands thus  viz  MIRARI COEPERVNT ΕΘΑΥΜΑΖΟΝ  ET CONFVNDEBANTVR ΜΕΝΤΕΚΑΙΔΙ*EEgrΠΟΡΟΥΝ  At the Bottom of his Page not contented  with Dr  Mills  's  Reading  he adds  sic plane in Codice nostro non  ut apud Millium  tho' it will appear beyond all Dispute upon any one's Enquiry that the Doctor was not in the least to be blamed For as we observed before thro' the Carelessness of the Scribe the Latin Line be+ing carried beyond its due Bounds into the Greek Column and the Words MENTE and MEN TE consisting of five Capital Letters just the same in both Languages unhappily led Mr  Hearne  into this Mistake So that by defalcating one Word from the Latin and converting it into two Greek ones of no Signification at all he spoiled the Sense of the one and made the other quite superfluousBut some Faults sure are pardonable in so  voluminous  a Writer  To be particular in shewing his Talent at  Reasoning  would we fear be making too free with our  Reader  's Time We might quote three Parts of his Discourse on the  Stunsfield Pavement  had not Mr  Peyntr  thoroughly considered it already and give such Instances of it which nothing but  Envy  or  IllNature  could find Fault with But the following  Epistle  prevents our dwelling upon this Excellency it being a Masterpiece of its kind and what the Reader we hope will be greatly delighted with  But let the Epistle speak for itself There is one Paragraph in his  Pag  Preface to  Sprott  's  Chronicle  which really seems to be a new Method of  Reasoning  such as no Writer but himself we believe dares lay any Claim to He is there speaking in  Sprott  's Praise and his Words are these  Adeo ut non videam cur mihi sit Detrimento si publice declarem me opinari de Academia nostra Oxoniensi Opus etiam justum ac distinctum contexuisse  And then comes the Reason in the very next Sentence viz  Opinioni favet Auctoris Pietas Quod si Tu aliter sentias Ego in Sententia non perstabo  nec  quorsum recidant quaecunque animadverti magnopere laborabo si modo illud concesseris de Collegio Cantuariensi Opus post se reliquisse in quo multa itidem de tota Academia è Monumentis praeclaris obiter notaverit  This is the Argument produced to prove that the Author of that  lean Chronicle  whether  Sprott  or some other it not clearly appearing that  Sprott  was the Author of it composed many other valuable Books not at all inferior to the  Chronicle  which is published Great Pity indeed that such profitable Works should be buried  in Obscurity and doubtless was there not some Hope of their being still recoverable  Sprott  's Admirers how inflexible soever in other Cases would lament greatly under their Loss in this  Agreeable to this new Method of Reasoning we find an uncommon Conjecture in his Preface to the Sixth Volume of  Leland  's  Itinerary  which very few Writers would ever have made From a Medal of  Carausius  bearing this Inscription VICTORIA CEA he endeavours to prove that the Brogue of the common People is the true Standard of the  Roman  Dialect and Pronunciation The Word  Caesar  according to this  curious Remark  is not to be pronounced as it generally is by People of Fashion and Breeding  Cesar  but agreeable to the broad Manner of speaking used by the most rustic of Mankind and as it stands upon the Coin CEASAR  We acknowledge the Observation to be a very curious one and to stand upon the Authority of a Medal but if it should ever be discovered that it proceeded from an Error of the  MintMaster  from a simple Literal Transposition or from any other Accident as possibly it might the Remark will then sink into its Value The  Coin indeed may be curious upon the Account of the Blunder but is no more an Argument to ascertain the Truth of Dialect or Pronunciation than that  spurious Halfpenny  of his present  Majesty  would be a Standard in the next Age for pronouncing GEOGIVS instead of GEORGIVS  It would waste too much of the Reader's Time probably to offer here a Collection of all the Poetical Fragments scattered thro' his Labours the Preservation of which by Printing them we must observe shews no small Desire to be useful to Mankind as these Rhythmes contain either Lessons of Oeconomy such as  With a red Man reade thy read  With a brown Man break thy Bread  At a pale Man draw thy Knife  From a black Man keep thy Wife  Rob Glouc Vol p  Or an Account of an ancient local Custom  Ule Ule Ule Ule  Three Puddings in a Pule  Crack Nuts and cry Ule  Rob Glouc p  Or else an Illustration of a Pedigree  William de Coningsby  Came out of Britany  With his Wife Tiffany  And his Maid Manfas  And his Dog Hardegrass  Thus have we collected some Memorials of Mr  Hearne  's Life and have taken the Liberty to correct some few Mistakes in his Writing In a Thing of such Moment we have been very careful not to offend any impartial Reader we have avoided  Flattery  on the one Hand and  Scandal  on the other We have described his good Qualities as they occurred and rectified such as must be acknowledged to have been gross  Errors  and such as he would not pass over in any Author that fell in his way either Living or Dead Nay if any Person differed from Him but in his own private Opinion it was Ground sufficient for him to let loose the Reins of his utmost Vengeance a flagrant and very unjustifiable Instance of which we shall here produce  In the Year Mr  Hearne  in the Catalogue of  Trifles  of which he had been the Editor subjoined to one of his most  trifling  ones  Johannis

judgment of Mr  Moyle  's WorksAs to my  Clypeus Votivus  for such the best Antiquaries judge it to be Mr  Moyle  passes sentence upon it without ever having seen it from two very imperfect Sketches of Dr  Clarke  and  Drakensberg  and without having consulted Mr  Dodwell  's excellent Book  de Parma  c where he might have seen the Question of the Theatres fairly discussed in order to the ascertaining the true Antiquity of the Shield That truly learned Man is far from carrying the Antiquity of it up to the time of the Sacking of  Rome  by the  Gauls  So that Mr  Moyle  in demolishing that Notion only demolishes a mere fancy of his own But that it was antient is agreed by the best Judges of all Nations and the Baron  Spanheim  and Mr  Abednego Sellers  two of the most learned Men of the last Century thought it so considerable that they had both begun to write Dissertations on it but were both prevented finishing them by Death'  This Treatment of Mr  Moyle  was by Mr  Curll  a Bookseller in  London  very justly reprehended who with an Edition he had printed of Mr  Moyle  's Works published in his Life time sent the following Letter to  Anthony Hammond  Esq  as an Apology for his Friend Mr  Moyle  some Account of whose Life and Writings he had just then published  Let us a little consider Sir says Mr  Curll  the Antagonists Mr  Moyle  has met with through the Management of Mr  Serjeant  Mr  Thomas Serjeant  of the Tower publish'd Mr  Moyle  's  Posthumous Works  as the whole of his Writings without so much as taking Notice of what that Gentleman had himself published  As to the Attacks of Mess  Whiston  and  Woolston  relating to the  Thundering Legion  their  Guides  are so very  bad that I dare say their  Followers  will be very few I shall therefore content my self with what  Monsieur Le Clerc  observes upon a particular Occasion  See Bibliotheque Choise  ARTIC of Mr  Addison  's Remarks on  Italy  c  'Mr  Addison  is of Opinion  says he  that the Figure of  Jupiter Pluvius  sending down Rain on the fainting Army of  Marcus Aurelius  and Thunderbolts on his Enemies is the greatest Confirmation possible of the Story of the  Thundering Legion  This learned Man would apparently mean to say that this Figure is a Monument of the Shower which fell on the  Roman  Army and of the Thunder which confounded the  Germans  for as to the  Thundering Legion  the Learned are agreed that it had that Denomination long before this Circumstance and that there is no Probability that it was intirely made up of  Christians  See  Henry  de  Valois  upon  Eusebius Lib    Cap  and Father  Pagi  upon the Year CLXXIV'  Thus with  Monsieur Le Clerc  I leave this  Thundering Legend  And may it still continue to lead up the Van of Miracles in the  Romish  Church for as Mr  Moyle  well Remarks as it took its Name from  Paganism  See  his  Posthum Works  Vol p  it is most proper that it should end in  Popery  I shall by and by incur the same Censure as Mr  Moyle  has undergone for I freely acknowledge that I have the same Opinion of Archibishop  Tillotson  which he had of Bishop  Sanderson That  He  had more  Judgment  than all the  Fathers  put together  And I believe the same Character might justly be given of Bishop  Taylor  Bishop  Pearson  Dr  Barrow  and that truly great Man you have named Bishop  Stilling fleet  and several other of our  English  Divines  Before I mention any part of Mr  Hearne  's Charge I shall give a Summary of Mr  Moyle  's Religious Principles in his own Words  viz  'If Men  says he  would but consider that it is not only our Duty but our Interest to be Virtuous one would think this were no hard Task to perform  viz  reforming the Manners of the People and restoring them to their antient Sobriety and Virtue Among a thousand Advantages that Christianity has above all other Religions this is none of the least that it has united our Interest  and our Duty together Would not a wise Man be Chaste for the sake of Health Honest for the sake of Profit Temperate for the sake of Pleasure and all Three for the sake of Fame For Vice was never yet so triumphant as to be in greater Reputation than Virtue These Considerations together with the innumerable Mischiefs and Inconveniencies which attend a vicious Course of Life ought in Reason to reclaim Men from  all  unmanly Excesses One would think in a Christian Nation that Religion and Conscience our own Hopes and Fears the Prospect of eternal Happiness or endless Misery should be Considerations strong enough to lay an effectual Restraint on the most violent Lusts and AppetitesOne of the greatest Obstacles in my Opinion to the Reformation of Manners is that too many Men place all Virtue and Religion in warmly adhering to the Interest of this or that particular Sect or Party As if a fiery Zeal for the Church or the MeetingHouse could atone for Lewdness and Debauchery or as if vicious and immoral Men could be of any Christian Church or Community'  See  his Charge to the  Grand Jury  at  L  seard  Works  Vol p and  Now Sir tho' I should be as far from interrupting the indefatigable Labours of Mr  Hearne  in his Historical Studies as any Man living yet I think no Man ought to be indefatigable in Slander and that the Unchristian Temper he has shewn ought to be reprehended And it gives me no small Concern to find the grave Style of an Antiquarian changed to the foulmouthed Language of the most abandoned Prostitute Neither can I by any means agree that whatever  unguarded Expressions  Mr  Moyle  may have dropt can be just Grounds of Provocation for such Scurrility as I believe never before fell from the Pen of any Controvertist But Mr  Moyle  has himself hit the right Nail on the Head in the Passage above cited Mr  Moyle  was a professed  Whig  and a hearty Wellwisher to his Country Mr  Hearne  is a professed  NonJuror  and a fiery Bigot to those of his own Principles With him Pope  Clement  the XI and Mr  Dodwell  were equally Infallible and in the true meaning of the Word I believe so too Mr  Moyle  as a  Whig  must be  a Republican a Contemner of Religions one who had a natural Antipathy to the Clergy and their Friends a meer Ignoramus  and in good Ecclesiastical Charity  gone to the Devil  I cannot  help therefore asking you Sir whether you really think the Positions advanced by Mr  Moyle  in his  Lescard  Charge or any part of his Conduct to which you were ever a Witness could deserve such Treatment especially from one who never knew him otherwise than by his Writings  As to the  Critical Dispute  I shall be as silent as I resolve to be about the  Legendary one  above mentioned Yet I cannot help observing that what Dr  Woodward  says is very merrily dogmatical For he will have it that Mr  Hearne forms a right Judgment of all Mr  Moyle  's Worksbecause the best Antiquaries have judged his Shield to be a  Clypeus Votivus And Mr  Moyle  is highly criminal  and passes Sentence upon it without ever having seen it  otherwise than by two Draughts Now I would only ask the learned Doctor one plain Question  If I see the Picture of a Horse  am I to believe the  living Animal  it represents to be a  Bear  But indeed he descends a little and says That  the Baron  Spanheim  and Mr  Sellers intended to write Dissertations upon it and that some other Antiquarians really believed it to be an Antique  anglice  the Back of an Old Sconce which I have been credibly informed he bought in  RagFair  As to that Piece of Mr  Dodwell  's which Mr  Hearne  complains is imperfectly printed it is to be hoped he will oblige the learned World with a more correct Copy tho' this Imputation does not lye against Mr  Moyle  but against the  Person  who transmitted that Piece to him  May Mr  Hearne  hereafter retain a more Christian Temper May his useful Studies as you are pleased to call them meet with all the Success he can expect and may the scurrillous Cavils both of him and every other Writer meet with that just Contempt which is due to such Performances This is the hearty Wish of  Sir  Yours c E CURLL  Upon this Occasion Mr  Curll  also wrote the following Letter to Mr  Hearne  viz  SIR  YOUR late  Invective  against Mr  Moyle  I shall prove to be wholly  Groundless  and therefore it turns upon  yourself  In the first place you will have it that all who dissent from Mr  Dodwell  are  a set of abandoned Wretches and such indeed was  Walter Moyle  Esq  whose Posthumous Works all good Men ought to lay aside  for Reasons hereafter to be considered As to Mr  Dodwell  I had above twenty Years intimate Correspondence with him and always believed him to be a learned and very pious Man But at the same time all who knew him will allow that Mr  Dryden  's Character of a certain Peer in  Absalom  and  Achitophel  too much resembled Mr  Dodwell  for he truly was what the Poet asserts  Stiff in Opinions  mostly  in the Wrong  Was every thing by starts and nothing long  The First Book I ever printed was the present of a Manuscript he made me in Defence of his now sufficiently exploded Doctrine of the  Divine Imortalizing Spirit transfused by Baptism  An  Explication  of a  famous Passage  in the Dialogue of St  Justin Martyr  with  Tryphon  concerning the  Immortality  of  Human Souls  c vo printed in the Year price  s    d  And if you will undertake to vindicate every Notion he advanced  God speed the Plough  Secondly you will have it that Mr  Moyle treats  with great Contumacy and Arrogance many of the best and most excellent Authors as well ancient as modern  tho' you name none but your  Doctissimus  Woodwardus  vir Clarissimus  of whom more in the sequel and you add  he does not spare even the  Holy  Fathers of whom he confidently asserts that Bishop  Sanderson  had more  Judgment  than all of them put together  And I am as confident that every Man of  Judgment  in  Europe  believes this Article of Mr  Moyle  's CREED  Now since your Breast is animated with so much Heat in behalf of these  Venerabilia  the  Fathers  I desire to know by what better Authority than a  Popish  Canonization are they invested with the Epithet of  Holy  If indeed all the  Libertinism  of  Youth  be sufficient to confer that Title and all the  Impotence  of  Age  be sufficient to confirm it the Plea is good and the Precedents produced may be St  Augustine  St  Origen  and that notorious Saint of  Creedmaking  Memory St  Athanasius  Who in their Works may say of each other  Quantum mutatus ab illo  Therefore as to their  Sacredness  I think it  may be fairly said to be  extinct  Upon these Considerations indeed  you ought to be sorry and ashamed to mention Mr  Moyle  as you have done  Thirdly  With what Face other than that of an assuming Arrogance can you say that Mr  Moyle was but a superficial Writer  after Dean  Prideaux  with whom certainly you will have the Modesty to own you cannot stand in Competition  has thanked him for the Pains he had taken about his  Connection And declares that  he should have been glad of the Assistance of so  Learned  a Friend near him to whom he might have communicated that History  before it was printed  Posth Works Vol p  You farther add with an equal share of Confidence and Falshood as will appear from the Sentiments of learned Men that  he was one who on account of his Hatred to the Clergy and their Friends has boldly according to the measure of his Understanding  I heartily wish yours was either as deep or as honest  railed against the best Writers and the most excellent Men  But  latet Anguis in Herba  the Men you here hint at are the professed Enemies of our Constitution both in Church and State and as  such only were opposed by Mr  Moyle  What you farther with the greatest Disingenuity insinuate against him may be strictly applied to your own Temper that as all good Men must despise the Censure of so scurrilous an Antagonist so they must upon the same Principles have but a very slight Opinion of those Persons whose Encomiums are drawn by your Pen  Mr  MOYLE  's  waywardEditor  you have indeed justly reprehended but as to your Cavils concerning the  Bath  Inscription they are equally disingenuous Does he not tell Dr  Musgrave  whom he allowed to be a superior Judge with all the becoming Modesty of a well bred Gentlemen that  he could pretend to no great Skill in these Matters but since you ask my Opinion  says he to the Doctor  I will give it with my usual Frankness not doubting but you will receive it with your usual Candour  Posth Works Vol pag  This is corresponding like Men of Sense and Integrity  As you began with Mr  Dodwell  I am sorry to conclude that you are guilty of  the Charge he brings against his Opponents in the Piece I printed for him abovementioned  pag    It is my great Unhappiness  says he  that I have to do with Adversaries who will not be confined to the Subject of our principal Dispute without deviating to personal Reflections wherein the Reader is not any Way concerned  This is the Bane of all Controversy and I hope for the future you will avoid it  Lastly  As to your  Vir Clarissimus  Woodwardus  Doctissimus  he most learnedly follows the  Lowbell  of your Scandal and  shields  himself under your Sentiments of his  Clypeus Votivus  But I would advise neither of you to be too fond of your own confined Speculation and rest assured that there has already been more Thousands sold of Mr  Moyle  's Works than ever there will be Hundreds either of your  Monkish  Chronicles or his  FossilarianLabours  including his late Fardle of  Selfconceit  prefix'd to his  Selfdefence  against the Objections of the learned  Camerarius  which was written by himself tho' he has franked it under the Cover of his Translator  Holloway  And to my other Wishes for your Welfare may you during  Life reign unrivalled  Legendarygrubber  to the University of  Oxford  E CURLL  PS  That the Public may be fully convinced how different the Sentiments of the  truly Learned  are from those  Selfconceited Sciolists  who have attacked Mr  Moyle  's Writings it will be sufficient to produce the Judgment given by  Monsieurde la Roche  See New Memoirs of Literature for the Month of  September  Vol pag  seq  of  The whole Works of  Walter Moyle  Esq  published by himself  'Wit good Sense and Learning are equally conspicuous in the Works of the late Mr  Moyle  and therefore it was very proper to reprint those Pieces which were published by the Author himself at several Times by which Means we have now in Three Volumes all the Works of that Ingenious and Learned Gentleman He being a very honest Man was always very zealous for the Liberty of his Country and that noble Character appears in many Parts of his Works When he came into  Parliament he always acted a very honourable Part He was a Person of an uncommon Beneficence and Humanity A more extensive Charity and a truer Love for his Country was scarce to be found in any Man It appears he had a great Esteem for the Clergy and was admirably well qualified for  Critical Enquiries  '  Mr  Moyle  's Works are printed for Mr  Curll    Now lest we should be thought  partial  as to what we have written concerning the  Triflings  of this notable Antiquary we shall here produce what Mr  Alexander Pope  of  Twickenham  in the County of  Middlesex  hath noted concerning him  viz  'I can never enough praise my very good Friend the exact Mr  Thomas Hearne  who if any Word occur which to him and all Mankind is evidently  wrong  yet keeps he it in the Text with due Reverence and only remarks in the Margin  Sic MSS  or  Sic Orig  '  And in another Place he thus delivereth himself  'Our own Antiquary Mr  Thomas Hearne  hath published many curious Tracts which our Poet hath to his great Contentment perused'  In  Glossar  to  Rob  of  Glocester    Artic  BEHETT others say BEHIGHT  promised  and so it is used  excellently well by Thomas Norton  in his Translation into Metre of the th Psalm  verse    I to the Lord will pay my Vows  That I to him  BEHIGHT  'Where the modern Innovators not understanding the Propriety of the Word which is truly  English  from the  Saxon  have most  unwarrantably  altered it thus  I to the Lord will pay my Vows  With Joy and  great Delight  V Ibid  'HIGHT In  Cumberland  they say to  hight  for to  promise  or  vow  but HIGHT usually signifies  was called  and so it does in the  North  even to this Day notwithstanding what is done in  Cumberland  '  V AREDE  '  Read  or  Peruse  tho' sometimes used for  Counsel  READE THY READ  take thy Counsaile Thomas Sternholde  in his Translation of the first  Psalm into  English  Metre hath  wisely  made use of this Word  The Man is blest that hath not lent  To wicked  READ  his Ear  'But in the last spurious Editions of the singing Psalms the Word  Read  is changed into  Men  I say spurious Editions because not only here but quite throughout the whole Book of Psalms are strange Alterations all for the worse And yet the Titlepage stands as it used to do And all which is abominable in any Book much more in a sacred Work is ascribed to  Thomas Sternholde John Hopkins  and others I am confident were  Sternholde  and  Hopkins  now living they would proceed against the Innovators as Cheats A Liberty

Gloss  on  Rob  of  Gloc Art  REDE'  We do herein agree with Mr  Hearne  Little is it of Avail to object that such Words are become  unintelligible  Since  they are truly  English  we  ought  to understand them and such as are for  Uniformity  should think all Alterations in a Language  Strange abominable  and  unwarrantable  SCRIBLERUS  Not in  DUNC  This is all  Ironicè  and  ScriblerianRailery  and as such only is it here produced Of all such Antiquaries therefore as Mr HEARNE well hath Mr POPE decribed them  dim in Clouds the poreing Scholiasts mark  Wits who like Owls

past  With equal Justice hath Mr  Pope  finely rallied another Species of these poring Wretches the  mere Medalists  who are wholly ignorant of the  true use  of those  Coins  which they seem so intensely to study  viz  With sharpen'd Sight pale Antiquaries pore  Th'  Inscription  value but the  Rust  adore  This the  Blue  varnish that the  Green  indears  The  sacred Rust  of twice Two hundred Years  To gain  Pescennius  one employs his Schemes  One gains a  Cecrops  in exstatic Dreams  Poor  Vadius  Dr  Woodward  long with learned Spleen devour'd  Can taste no Pleasure since his Shield was scour'd  And  Curio  restless by the FairOne's Side  Sighs for an  Otho  and neglects his Bride  Pope  's Verses to Mr  Addison  on his  Dialogues  upon  Medals    It is now high Time to take Leave of such  Glossographers  and  Medallists  as  these so justly censured by Mr  Pope  For according to Mr  Hearne  's very silly Defence of  Sternholde  and  Hopkins  our Language should not have admitted of any Improvements but have continued in the obsolete Guise of  Geoffrey  of  Monmouth  and  Chaucer  nor is it to be doubted but Mr  Hearne  was full in Opinion that Mr  Dryden  had injured  Chaucer  's Diction as much as those he calls the  Innovators  upon the  Psalms  We shall next consider our Antiquary's Political and Religious Principles  Mr  Hearne  wrote a Letter to his Patron Mr  Cherry  in Vindication of those who took the  Oath  of  Allegiance  to King  William  It was intitled  A Vindication of these who take the Oath of Allegiance to his present Majesty from Perjury Injustice and Disloyalty charged upon them by such as are against it Wherein is evidently shewed That the common Good of a Nation is what is primarily and principally respected in an Oath and therefore when the Oath is inconsistent with that the Persons who have taken it are absolved from it In proving of which the  Case  of  Maud  and King  Stephen  is particularly considered In a Letter to a NonJuror  Conscientia mille Testes Printed in the Year vo  and we cannot think it any bad Part of a Man's Character to give his Reasons for complying with that  Oath  which others refused The Point was disputable and Censures no Doubt were passed upon the  Jurors  as well as  NonJurors  His Reasons for Compliance how weak soever in the Eyes of those of a different Persuasion were doubtless good in his own and if he discovered better afterwards for  refusing  the Oath than he before gave for the  taking  it we think and with strict Justice that he ought to have produced them for the Benefit of the Public and clearing the Point in Dispute How he became dissatisfied in this Affair is not the Business of our Inquiry  What Mr  Hearne  could mean by publishing a Letter of King  Charles  I when Prince of  Wales  therefrom insinuating that his Royal Highness had then an Intrigue upon his Hands and the Duke of  Buckingham  played the Part of Pimp upon the Occasion is a Mystery which we believe his Fautors will have much ado to unravel But at the earnest Request of many Friends we have here reprinted that Letter to shew what little Grounds there were for so ill a Construction as has been put upon it It is as follows  viz  STEENIE  A Nickname given by King  James  I to the Duke of  Buckingham  I Have nothing now to wryte to you but to give you thankes bothe for the good councell ye gave me and for the Event of it The King gave mee a good sharpe potion but you tooke away the working of it by the well relished Comfites ye sent after it I have met with the Partie that must not be named once alreddie and the cullor of wryting this Letter shall make me meete withe her on Saturday although it is written the Day being Thursday So assuring you that the Busines goes safelie onn I rest  Your constant loving Friend CHARLES  I hope ye will not show the King this Letter but put it in the safe Custodie of Mister  Vulcan  On the Back this  Pr Ch to the

sordid poor Wretch had an universal Mistrust of the Generality of Mankind lived in a slovenly niggardly Manner and died  possessed  of what he had not the Heart to  enjoy  We have been informed that a

must have but little Knowledge of human Nature not to be sensible of that Curiosity which prompts Mankind to be acquainted with the History of Persons distinguished by their extraordinary Virtues and Qualifications and who have experienced many uncommon Varieties of Life In reading their Transactions we become agreeably intimate with the Characters which have raised our Admiration we attend them in the different Scenes thro' which they pass and are sensible of a secret Longing to imitate the shining Parts of their Conduct They frequently teach us an easy Moderation in Prosperity and are no less successful in reconciling us to the severe Dispensation of Providence  THE Impressions we receive from personal Characters are more lively and affecting than such as are imparted to us by moral Precepts and those Virtues which Institutions of Philosophy might give us but a languid Invitation to imitate are altogether irresistable when they are set off by the Conduct of Persons of Elevation and they must be thrown into Action in order to give them their last Polish and Refinement  THIS may be one Reason why Biography has generally met with such a favourable Reception and we may venture to affirm that if the Authors who engage in this Kind of Writing would select such Characters as are entertaining and instructive at the same Time they would have no Cause to complain of any Disregard from the Public  THE noble Lady who is the Subject of the following Memoirs has made so conspicuous and engaging a Figure thro' the series and Vicissitudes of a long Life that she may be justly reputed an Honour to her own Sex as  she has always been the Admiration of ours  IF a Descent from an illustrious Race of  British  Nobility a polite and generous Education an early Familiarity with the most amiable Accomplishments an inchanting Harmony of Person and Mind a Virgin Purity of Youth and a taintless Fidelity of conjugal Life have any Charms in the softer Sex they have all lent their full Lustre to the late Dutchess of  ORMONDE  IT should seem as if Providence intended to guard this Lady from every Imputation that could be formed against her by envious and detracting Minds and therefore would not confine her Virtues to Scenes of Satisfaction and Prosperity she had long convinced the World of her Ability to act an unexceptionable Part in such a Situation but something still remained to give her Conduct its full Perfection The appointed Period arrived this incomparable Person was deprived of the dearest of all her Enjoyments She saw herself for ever separated from her darling Consort and her former Affluence contracted into a very  moderate Limitation Her Sunshine of Happiness darkened with Adversity but that Adversity only gave her an Opportunity of charming all who knew her by her inimitable Resignation to the Decrees of Heaven  AS there was Reason to believe the Public would be curious to know the Particulars of a Life so diversified by such unusual Events all possible Care has been taken to collect every authentic Circumstance that could make such a Relation useful and entertaining and we presume that the Impartiality with which we have proceeded on this Occation will intitle this Performance to a candid Reception from those who are pleased to favour it with their Perusal  THE LIFE Of Her GRACE  MARY  Dutchess of  ORMONDE  _THE Dutchess of  ORMONDE  whose Life we propose to write was the Elder surviving Daughter of  Henry  Duke of  Beaufort  by his Dutchess  Mary  Daughter of that unfortunate Patriot the Lord  Capel  whose steady Attachment to his distressed Soveraign King  CHARLES  I deprived him in of a Life which deserved a much happier Period  THE most noble House of  Beaufort  as it was august in its Original so it has been perpetuated by a Train of Descendants who have been justly esteemed the Ornaments of their Country And the great  Plantagenets  who founded this illustrious Family have transmitted their Virtues thro' a long Series of their Posterity and adorned the Kingdom with a Progeny of both Sexes which will be ever remembered with Honour  THE Dutchess of  ORMONDE  was born at  Beaufort  House near  Chelsea Anno  and in her early Years presented such a Dawn of amiable Qualities to her noble Parents as convinced them that the Lustre of their Family would receive no Diminution from their lovely Daughter Animated by this Persuasion they were particularly careful to cultivate by a suitable Education the Virtues which had already sprung up in her Mind with such a luxuriant Bloom Their Cares succeeded to their Wish and there was no Accomplishment necessary to give Perfection to her Sex but what appeared with all its Charms in the Conduct of this young Lady  NATURE sometimes presents us with a great deal of Inequality in her Productions and it is no uncommon Thing to see a very disagreeable Exterior allotted to a finished Mind but she now determined to be uniform in her Operations and prepared for the Duke of  Beaufort  's Daughter a Form as amiable as the Soul which was to claim it for her Habitation  IT would require a Pen much more masterly in Description than mine to give the Reader a competent Idea of this engaging Lady the inchanting Harmony of her Shape the Lustre and Vivacity of her Eyes which inspired all who beheld them with unutterable Impressions the glowing Blush of the Rose which was blended in her Cheeks with the Virgin Purity of the Lilly the flowing Shade of Hair which wantoned in a Profusion of Ringlets that no Pencil could imitate the delicate Turn of her Face and the bewitching Softness which diffused itself thro' every Feature the panting Snow of her Bosom and the taper Whiteness of her Arms with a thousand other Beauties which perpetually played around her formed such an Assemblage of Perfection  that was to be resisted by nothing but Insensibility itself  WE believe we shall not be taxed with Falshood when we affirm that such a Prodigality of Charms were capable without any other Assistance of captivating a thousand Hearts but we have already intimated that Nature discarded all Partiality in her Plan and made this irresistable Form the Residence of a Soul which was altogether as attractive as its lovely Mansion The most refined Poignancy of her Wit was contrasted by the sedatest Judgment and each of these fine Qualifications were so beautifully softened by her native Sweetness of Temper that her Pleasantry never gave Pain and none ever thought themselves insulted by her superior Penetration  THE Happiness of her Memory facilitated her Improvement by those Books and Industry with which she was daily conversant and in a few Years it proved such a Treasury of Knowledge and Politeness as few Ladies of her Age were ever enriched with The little Levities of the Sex and those refined Deviations from Sincerity and Sanctity of Manners which are become so fashionable a Part  of modern Education were altogether unknown to her True Virtue is certainly amiable in herself but she puts on redoubled Charms when she shines in the Conduct of a blooming Virgin  SUCH was the Lady we are describing her Mind was as immaculate as her Face and every Year that added to her Youth presented her with new Perfections and awaken'd a general Curiosity to know what happy Man was to be bless'd with the Endearments of her nuptial Love  IT is not to be imagined in what Manner that pleasing Expectation influenced some of the noblest of the  British  Youth A virtuous young Lady of Rank and Beauty is a publick Blessing she civilizes the Souls of her Admirers more than all their Academical Institutions and fires them to aim at a proper Similitude of Accomplishments Innocence Purity and Honour appear so persuasive in the FairOne that it is no Wonder if she daily increases the Number of their Votaries and brings them fresh Accessions of Homage  AMONGST the shining Crouds of Adorers who wished to inspire her with the soft Sensibility of Love none made so conspicuous a Figure as the Duke of  Ormonde  he was descended from a very antient and illustrious Family that had given many Heroes to their Country and in the Person of the Duke had presented it with an Ornament that did not a little contribute to its Lustre Death had for some Time deprived him of his first Lady who was the eldest Daughter of the Earl of  Rochester  and left him a Widower in the full Bloom of his Youth His endearing Behaviour to his deceased Dutchess warmed many of the fairest with secret Wishes to succeed her in his Embraces His Person was such as might impart the softest Impressions to the chastest Heart and was set off by such a winning Singularity of Sweetness Generosity and every other Quality which constitutes the fine Gentleman that it was almost impossible for him to be long considered with Indifference by any Lady to whom he breathed his Passion We may add to this that he possessed such a Princely Estate that Fortune seemed to contend with Nature which of them should be his greatest Benefactor It is true the Duke  only valued the Favours of the former as they enabled him to distinguish himself by numberless Acts of Humanity and indulged him in his natural Propensity to Benevolence And if the Goddess has not of late been so liberal to many others it may have proceeded from their being destitute of his Inclinations to communicate her Bounties to their Fellow Creatures  AFTER the Account I have attempted to give of these two illustrious Persons it will be natural to conclude that they were formed for each other and therefore without entering into the Particulars of that tender Intercourse which Love and a Similitude of Dispositions established between them it will be sufficient if we acquaint the Reader that his Grace was so fortunate in his Addresses as to prevail on the Duke of  Beaufort  's charming Daughter to consent to be the loveliest Bride in  England  THE Number of the young Dutchess's Admirers was not diminished by her Marriage and tho' they found themselves restrained from disclosing to her the Sentiments with which her Charms had inspired them yet there were several who  merited that Friendship by a Number of amiable Qualities  IT often happens that Men of Wit thro' too much Partiality to themselves are apt to fancy that a Lady's Satisfaction in their Conversation must create a Fondness for their Persons and the Earl did not fail to impute to the Dutchess Impressions in his Favour which she herself was never sensible of and consequently he was always ready to improve every Instance of her Complacency too much to his own Advantage The Opinion he entertained of his being more agreeable to her than he really was made him look on the dishonourable Conduct he was meditating against the Duke as a Crime that was capable of a very easy Vindication he thought it more honourable to succeed with the Dutchess than to preserve Fidelity in his Friendship to her Lord and to such an Infatuation was he hurried by his guilty Love that he imagined it to be the most criminal Action in the World to neglect the Happiness which his Vanity represented the Dutchess inclinable to afford him  IN Consequence of this Persuasion as he had the Honour one Evening to lead her Grace from the Drawing Room he slipt a Letter into her Hand as she was stepping into her Coach and then retired with a profound Reverence The Lady believed the Paper contained some agreeable Piece of Poetry in which the Earl as we intimated before was very happy and was impatient to read this new Product of his Capacity But who can describe her Confusion and Resentment when she found it to be a Declaration of Love and her Displeasure was the greater as she was conscious that no Part of her Conduct could possibly give that Nobleman any Pretentions to the indecent Presumption with which he treated her and tho' it was late at Night she resolved to acquaint the Dutchess her Mother with the Affront that had been offered to her Virtue  SHE accordingly ordered her Coachman to drive to the Dutchess of  Beaufort  's House and at her Arrival there went into her Grace's BedChamber and intreated her with a Flood of Tears to read the Letter she put into her Hands The Dutchess was not a little surprized  to see her Daughter in a Disorder of Mind intirely new to her and immediately read over the Letter with an Astonishment natural to such an Event  Is it possible Madam  said the Dutchess of  Ormonde that any Man can dare to think he has a Privilege to treat me in this dishonourable Manner I can appeal to Heaven and Earth that my Conduct has hitherto been without Reproach which makes this Violation of the Respect due to me so insupportable  THE Dutchess of  Beaufort  was as much dissatisfied with this Adventure as her Daughter and was justly apprehensive that it might be attended with very fatal Consequences to prevent which all imaginable Discretion was necessary  WHILST they were deliberating what Steps were most proper to be taken in so delicate an Affair a Lady of great Quality and a near Relation to them both came in very seasonably to assist at the Consultation and after she had heard a particular Account of the whole Affair she gave it as her Opinion that  it would be most proper for the Dutchess of  Ormonde  to dissemble her Resentment and treat the amorous Peer with such an  Air of Indifference as would effectually mortify his Vanity and discourage him from persisting in his criminal Desires  The Lady added  that if such a Course of Behaviour should not have the Effect that might be reasonably expected she would undertake to disclose the Affair to the Duke of  Ormonde  in such a Light as should engage him to come into a Scheme she had formed for making this new Lover the Diversion of the whole Town  THIS Advice was allowed to be just and after some farther Consideration the Dutchess of  Ormonde  took her Leave with a Determination to conduct herself according to her Relations Sentiments It was not long before the young Earl saw her and as he was pleased to flatter himself that the Graces of his Wit and Person were irresistable he was not a little surprised at the negligent Manner in which the Dutchess heard all the fine Things he said to her and as he found that he had not made the least Impression on her Heart he began to imagine she might possibly not have read his Letter for he could not believe that so much premeditated Wit and Tenderness as it contained could prove ineffectual and therefore resolved to be certain that  his next Letter should be read by the Dutchess for which Purpose he found Means to gain as he imagined one of her Women to his Interest he made her a Present of a large Purse of Gold accompanying it with a second Billet which he intreated her to deliver into her Lady's Hands and at the same Time gave her to understand that if she acquitted herself of the Confidence he reposed in her to his Satisfaction there was nothing she might not promise herself from his future Bounty  THE Dutchess's Woman performed her Commission and gave the Letter to her Lady with a particular Account of the Earl's Liberality and all the large Promises he had made her The Dutchess after she had read the Letter made her Mother and the other Lady who had instructed her how to behave acquainted with the Contents upon which they thought it now a proper Time to make the Duke of  Ormonde  privy to the Secret This they did in such a Manner as easily disposed his Grace to come into their Measures to make his Rival as ridiculous as his Vanity ought to render him To accomplish which it was agreed among them that the Dutchess should answer  her Lover's Letter and it is easy to imagine that an Epistle dictated by such Persons and on such an Occasion was artful enough to deceive even a Gentleman of the Earl's Penetration It would be no disagreeable Entertainment to the Reader could I repeat all the pleasant Things and the diverting Contrivances that were invented by this illustrious Company to expose the presuming Lover The Dutchess of  Ormonde  was for having him  privately admitted into the House and shut up in some Place where he might be half frozen before he should be set at Liberty  But the Duke replied  That would be a Management of too low a Turn for the Earl's nice and delicate Taste  and then recollecting that his Garden Wall was of a very convenient Heighth he thought it would be best  for the Lover to climb over it in order to come to his Lady the Danger and Difficulty only tending to compleat the Glory of such a gallant Adventure besides  added he  we shall by this Means see whether his Lordship is in earnest and dare hazard his fine Person in the Prosecution of his Amour  THIS Proposal meeting with the Approbation of all the Ladies they went  into the Garden to examine the Wall and observing a Place that had Hooks which a Ladder might be commodiously fastened to the Dutchess's Woman had Directions to describe this convenient Situation to the Earl but it was not done till several Letters had passed between him and the Dutchess and he became persuaded that his Addresses were as successful as he could wish And now the Dutchess's Woman acquainted him  he had made all imaginable Impressions on her Lady and that she expected the Pleasure of his Company with the greatest Impatience but then  continued she  it will be impossible for your Lordship to pass by the Porter in any Disguise and you are not insensible what Regard is due to a Lady's Reputation in an Affair of this Nature and therefore some Expedient must be thought of to prevent any Discovery of your being admitted into my Lady's Apartment  THE Earl upon this gave her the strongest Assurances of his strict Regard for the Dutchess's Honour  and therefore  said he  I am desirous of being introduced in any Manner you can contrive to prevent my being discovered by any of the Servants and there is no Danger that I  will ever decline to accomplish my Happiness with all the Privacy my lovely Dutchess can possibly desire  THE Gentlewoman finding him in such a Resolution thought it then proper to acquaint him  That no Way would be more effectual to prevent the Affair from being detected than for his Lordship to climb over the GardenWall  and then she described that particular Part of it where the Hooks were fastened  your Lordship  added she  is too gallant to hesitate at any little Danger that you may be exposed to on such an Occasion and you are likewise to consider that you could not have a more favourable Opportunity of convincing my Lady that your Passion for her can make you despise every Hazard and Difficulty that may lie between you and the Happiness you are in Pursuit of and therefore if your Lordship has no Objection to what I have been proposing I will be at Eleven this Night in the Garden to receive you  HIS Lordship was so animated with the Hopes of his imagined Joys that he told the Gentlewoman in a Kind of Transport  That he thought Fortune was very propitious to him in giving him such  an Opportunity of convincing her Lady how much his Passion could surmount every Danger and Impediment  upon which he took his Leave with a solemn Promise to be punctual to the appointed Time and then went to pay a Visit to the Duke of  Ormonde  by whom as was before observed he was treated with the greatest Friendship and Intimacy  THE Duke received him with his usual Affability and after some Conversation walked with him in his Garden where he could not forbear smiling to himself to observe with what a curious Eye his Visitor examined rhe Wall he was to scale that Evening After they had taken a few Turns the Earl took his Leave and went to his own House where he passed the Remainder of the Day with all the impatient Desires natural to a Lover who expects the happy Period of all his Wishes The appointed Hour was at last come and his Lordship did not fail to be exactly punctual at the Place agreed on where he found the Ladder of Ropes thrown over the Wall by the Means of which he mounted to the Top with wonderful Activity and from thence as nimbly descended into the Garden But alas how frequently  do Disappointments and Disgrace attend the finest Schemes of poor Mortals and how common is it for Men to meet with the most disagreeable Accidents in the very Instant that he promised himself nothing but Rapture and the most perfect Felicity The adventrous Peer had no sooner set Foot on the fatal Ground than the Gardener who happened to be a very sturdy Fellow pretending to mistake him for a Person who intended to rob the House fell upon him with Herculean Force and gave him such a vigorous Drubbing that he was obliged to cry out for Assistance The Noise alarmed the House and the Duke with all the Company who were then at Supper with him came out in a seeming Surprise to know the Occasion of the Clamours they heard Any one will imagine that the unfortunate Lover made no very graceful Figure in such a Conjuncture and as it was impossible for the Spectators of his Disgrace to keep their Countenances he grew sensible that this had been a premeditated Scheme to expose him But as he had a peculiar Presence of Mind and was likewise one of those Philosophic Lovers who never run distracted at the Disappoinment of their Passion he asked the Duke's  Pardon for the Folly he had committed desiring his Grace to impute it to a youthful Inconsideration he would no longer indulge after which he joined with the Company in their Mirth and rallied himself very pleasantly for the Discipline he had received from the honest Gardiner  THE Earl's ill Success in his Amour soon became public and was for a considerable Time the Entertainment of all the gay Company about the Court and besides this it entirely extinguished the Hopes of all who sighed for the amiable Dutchess in Secret They were convinced that her Vertue was impregnable and that it was possible for a Lady to be the fairest of her Sex and at the same Time capable of preserving an untainted Fidelity to her Nuptial Vow  The foregoing was an Adventure of the late Duke of  Buckinghamshire  when he was Earl of  Mulgrave  ANY one will easily believe that the Duke after this amiable Proof of his Lady's Virtue could not but cherish such a Treasure with the utmost Fondness and indeed our noble Pair lived in so mutual an Intercourse of Endearments as rendered them the Envy and  Admiration of the Age I say the Envy because there have been People malicious enough to declare that the Dutchess some time after her Marriage entertained such a Fondness for Cards as in a great Measure alienated the Duke's Affection from her for a considerable Time But whilst some have been so ungenerous as to propagate such a Report and others so weak as to believe it all must acknowledge this to be the only Frailty that was ever imputed to that Lady and even this has been aggravated much beyond the Reality of the Fact The Truth is Cards being at that Time as well as now the fashionable Amusement of the Fair it was impossible for the Dutchess whose House was continually filled with the best Company in the Kingdom to do otherwise than comply with the Inclinations of her Visitors in that Diversion and it may be true that she might sometimes sit up late at Play to oblige her Company and we will not deny that the Duke might be sensible of some Uneasiness to find his Lady compelled by the reigning Decorum among the Great to be absent more Hours from him than were agreeable to her Inclinations But at the same Time in Justice to the Memory of that incomparable  Lady we must affirm That the Moment she was sensible of the least Uneasiness in her Lord on that Account she never after would suffer Play to detain her from him to any late or unseasonable Hour A singular Instance this of a Lady who could resolve to sacrifice what was then thought an innocent Amusement to the Repose of her Consort whereas the same Motive now is frequently insufficient to make Numbers of the Sex resign Pleasures that are really criminal and injurious to their own and their Husband's Reputation But to return to this noble Pair  WHEN the Duke was constituted LordLieutenant of  Ireland  the Dutchess undertook that Voyage and her Reception and Return is so truly and so elegantly described by Mr  Dryden  in his Address to her Grace  See the  Dedication  of his  Fables  that it would be Injustice to his Memory to omit it on this Occasion  viz  Already have the Fates your Path prepar'd  And sure Presage your future Sway declar'd  When Westward like the Sun you took your Way  And from benighted  Britain  bore the Day  Blue  Tritons  gave

Ages has reserv'd for you  That happy Clime which Venom never knew  Or if it had been there your Eyes alone  Have Pow'r to chace all Poison but their own  Now in this Interval which Fate has cast  Betwixt your future Glories and your past  This Pause of Pow'r 'tis  Ireland  's Hour to mourn  While  England  celebrates your safe Return  By which you seem the Seasons to command  And bring our
