 THE SPLEEN OR THE OFFSPRING OF FOLLY A LYRICOMITRAGIC TALE IN FOUR CANTOS CUM NOTIS VARIORUM DEDICATED TO GEORGE COLMAN ESQ AUTHOR OF THE SPLEEN A COMIC PIECE PERFORMED WITH WONDERFUL SUCCESS AT

PATERNOSTER ROW MDCCLXXVI  TO GEORGE COLMAN Esq  SIR  AS you have done me the honour to make me the subject of your dramatic satire in doing which you have flown off in a direct tangent from the circle of science you will excuse me if in returning the compliment I have at any time apparently deviated from the line of mathematical truth in modelling the figures of poetical fiction The force of metaphorical expressions is not to be estimated so precisely as the momentum of mechanic powers and yet there may be as much veracity couched under the moral of an allegory as in the most demonstrable proposition of Euclid Of this at least I am certain that my characters are as justly drawn and my allusions as apt and applicable as yours Save and except  indeed your incomparable parallels which at the same time as they preserve their parallelism diverge with a true poetical licence like rays from a common centre  See the Spleen or Islington Spa Act I Also the London Review for April last  Happy Oxonians to whose superior privileges even lines and figures pay obsequious attention Congratulating you as one of the first of those highlyfavoured geniuses permit an humble  Cantab  to subscribe

As oft he did of yore  So well the sport dame  Folly  lov'd  That soon the teeming wanton prov'd  How late she had play'd the whore  II  But what a misgot mulish thing  Time from her pregnant womb might bring  Was held awhile in doubt  When lo at length before its time  In  Italy  's licentious clime  The brat came sprawling out  III  For tho 'tis said the bastard's lot  In  Britain  's clime to be begot  The  Genius  of our isle  Foreseeing of what little worth  Would prove the bantling at its birth  Thought 'twould the land defile  IV  Disgusted in a moody fit  Against th' unnatural taste of WIT  In fondling with the mother  He almost thought it was no sin  The worthless embrio while within  The womb in time to smother  V  When SPLEEN with her obstetric aid  Still following the midwife's trade  Determin'd to adopt it  Resolv'd to make its growth her charge  And set the  souterkin  at large  Where'er the mother dropt it  VI  From  England  banish'd strait through  France  The

nourishment to wring  From out her flabby udder  For lank her long dugs hanging down  Seem'd as if suck'd by half the town  Enough to make one shudder  IV  When FOLLY fearing lest her child  For lack

known that our hero in conjunction with this celebrated writer wrote or rather compiled a periodical paper entitled the  Connoisseur  which was first published some years past at Oxford The latter having written a number of this work which he particularly admired requested his colleague to go post with it to Oxford and to correct it with his own hand On  Coley  's arrival  Jackson  the printer informed him that the publication must inevitably be stopt if he had not the copy in two hours at farthest Here was an offer of  immortality  the poet could not forego He replied that having been a  bon vivant  the preceding evening he was but indifferently prepared for the task yet if he would furnish him with a room pen ink and paper he would see what could be done Being accommodated to his wishes he  transcribed  his friend  Thornton  's essay and delivered it for the press in little more than an hour  Jackson  was astonished at the  rapidity  of his genius and this identical paper making a considerable noise in the world at that time the printer as in duty bound proclaimed the velocity of his author's fancy a circumstance which procured him that  merited  fame he never after could be persuaded or even forced to resign  BATE  This anecdote is related with some little difference of circumstance in the last  London Review  PUFFER FOR THE LONDON REVIEWERS  Bonnel  bit grew

prevent the success of good writers support the dulness of bad ones and enforce the villainous impositions of managers On these occasions Justice Fielding's thieftakers and other ruffians have been introduced by our Hero and planted in every part of the house to cram down his own crudities and damn the productions of othersWere an author or actor particularly if a manager the greatest blockhead

the civilities he had shewn himand so he had for being confined with a fit of the gout and in consequence rendered incapable of playing a few nights the  manager  ordered his treasurer to put him under stoppages an instance scarce ever known before Mr  Ross  bore it with great temper only desiring the treasurer "to make his compliments to the manager and inform him that the deduction was
