ALSO BY T EGERTON WHITEHALL AND W RICHARDSON ROYAL EXCHANGE  LITERARY MEMOIRS OF LIVING AUTHORS OF GREAT BRITAIN  c c  M  MACARTHUR JOHN ESQ  SECRETARY to the Right Hon Admiral Lord Hood and formerly officiating Judge Advocate in North America He published in the year a very complete and useful Treatise on the Principles and Practice of Naval Courts Martial in an octavo volume Previous to this we believe  he  had written a treatise on the theory and practice of Fencing entitled "The Army and  Navy Gentleman's Companion" and published in a quarto volume in  MACAULAY REV ANGUS FAS  Curate of Claybrook in Leicestershire He published in "The History and Antiquities at Claybrook" an octavo volume Since that time beside two occasional single Sermons he has written "Rudiments of Political Science Part I" a work of very considerable merit published in an octavo volume in  MACAULAY JOHN ESQ MRIA  An occasional Poetaster of some merit He wrote in "Unanimity" a poem and has since that time▪ produced "The Genius of Ireland" a masque and a Monody on the Death of Lady Arabella Denny  MACCULLOCH REV ROBERT  Minister of the Gospel at Dairsie and author of "Lectures on the Prophecies of Isaiah" in two octavo volumes of which the first was published in and the second in These Lectures  are perfectly orthodox but perhaps too much of a popular complexion  MACDONALD REV DONALD  A Clergyman of the Church of Scotland He published in a burlesque on Fingal entitled "Three Beautiful and Important Passages omitted by the Translator of Fingal" in which he mocks the stile of Ossian with a crude species of humour Mr Macdonald has also written the Independent a novel in two duodecimo volumes and Velina a poetical fragment published in  MACDONALD THOMAS ESQ  Of the Inner Temple Barrister at Law This gentleman is author of a valuable Treatise on Civil Imprisonment in England published in an octavo volume in and also of "Thoughts on the Public Duties of Private Life" an elegant pamphlet published in  MACFARLAN ROBERT ESQ  The Author of an History of the Reign of George III King of Great Britain in four octavo  volumes of which the first was published in and the fourth in This publication though certainly not without the merit of utility cannot on many accounts be said to entitle Mr Macfarlan to firstrate distinction as an Historian We believe this gentleman formerly attempted a Translation of Ossian's Poems into Latin Hexameters of which he published the first book of "Temora" by way of specimen in Those who are acquainted with the characteristic genius and style of Ossian as well as with those of the Roman classics will wonder at such an undertaking The specimen produced upon this occasion was a very indifferent one  MACFARLAN REV JOHN DDF RSS  A Clergyman of the Church of Scotland He has been for some time one of the Ministers of Canongate Edinburgh and has written a Defence of the Clergy of the Church of Scotland who appeared in Opposition to the Intention of an unlimited Repeal of the Penal Laws against Roman Catholics an octavo volume of "Inquiries concerning the Poor" published in and Tracts on Subjects of National Importance published three years afterward  MACGREGOR JOHN  A Teacher of the Mathematics in Edinburgh and author of "A complete Treatise on Practical Mathematics" an octavo volume published in and "An Introduction to Mensuration" both of which are respectable performances  MACKAY ANDREW LLD FRSE  Of Aberdeen The author of a treatise on "The Theory and Practice of finding the Longitude at Sea or Land" in two thin octavo volumes published in a valuable work in which he displays a most extensive and accurate acquaintance with his subject Mr Mackay also wrote the articles Navigation Parallax Pendulum Projection of the Sphere ShipBuilding and Naval Tactics in the Encyclopaedia Britannica and is about to present the world with a Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Navigation and another in three volumes on the Theory and Practice of Astronomy  MACKENZIE HENRY ESQ  A native of Scotland and a gentleman whose elegance as a writer have justly entitled him to the name of the Addison of the North The first character which he assumed as an author was that of a sentimental and pathetic writer in which he met with considerable success "The Man of Feeling" a novel his first publication made its appearance in and was very favourably received In the same year he published "The Pursuits of Happiness" a poem and two years afterward "The Man of the World" a novel in two duodecimo volumes The Novel of Julia de Rubignè in two volumes duodecimo is also we believe to be attributed to his pen In the dramatic line of composition he has produced the Prince of Tunis a tragedy acted at Edinburgh in and we believe he altered the Fatal Curiosity of Lillo as it was represented at the Hay Market Theatre Mr Mackenzie edited in a quarto volume of "Poems by the late Rev Dr Thomas Blacklock together with an Essay on the Education of the Blind" to which he prefixed a most interesting and elegant Account of the Author's Life and Writings He announced at the same time the intended publication of some Sermons and other prose works by Dr Blacklock which we belive have not yet  appeared In the year when a society of literary gentlemen at Edinburgh came to the resolution of publishing a Periodical Paper Mr Mackenzie then of the Exchequer in that City was entrusted with the conduct of the work His numerous Papers in the Mirror the first production of that Society have been particularly distinguished for their elegance and neatness To the Lounger a periodical paper afterward published by the same Society he likewise contributed some very distinguished Essays Indeed we are of opinion that without the attraction of Mr Mackenzie's performances neither of these publications would have ranked very highly in the class of Periodical Papers But possessed of these they may boast a saving principle and a sterling excellence in their conformation which gives them a durable value and will insure them a lasting estimation among the works of taste  The following is a sentence which was passed upon Mr Mackenzie by a reviewer of the day upon the appearance of his Man of Feeling  It is probably a first work and from the specimen it affords of the talents of its author we should not be disposed to think that he will ever attain to any great eminence in literature He may amuse himself at the foot of Parnassus but to ascend the steeps of the mountain must be the task of those on whom their benignant stars have bestowed the rare gifts of true genius    MACKENZIE RODERICK ESQ  An Officer of a character no less honourable in the literary than in the military world He published in Strictures on Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton's History of the Campaigns in North America in and Mr Mackenzie was personally concerned as well as Col Tarleton in some of the most considerable actions of these campaigns and he animadverts with the greatest severity upon the Colonel's "History" His publication seems to have been undertaken from a motive of great generosity and friendly zeal viz to vindicate the fame of Lord Cornwallis whose military conduct had suffered certain disrepectful insinuations from Colonel Tarleton and whose distance from home deprived him of an opportunity of defending himself Mr Mackenzie has since that time published a "Sketch of the War with Tippoo Sultaun" in two quarto volumes which were printed at Calcutta in and This work contains much excellent and circumstantial information related in a strain of impartiality and in an honest unassuming manner which cannot fail to gratify every reader  MACKENZIE ANNA MARIA  This lady has produced several Novels at the LeadenhallStreet Press dedicated to the Goddess of Wisdom Among them are "Monmouth" "Danish Massacre" "Mysteries Elucidated" and "the Neapolitan" They are frequently voluminous and sometimes of a species somewhat superior to the generality of the fungous productions of that literary hotbed  MACKINTOSH JAMES ESQ  This gentleman published in  Vindiciae Gallicae  a Defence of the French Revolution and its English Admirers against the Accusations of Mr Burke which has been almost universally allowed to be one of the best written pamphlets ever produced in our language We believe Mr Mackintosh is also the author of two octavo volumes of Travels in Europe Asia and Africa published anonimously in They consist of a series of familiar wellwritten Letters abounding in Oriental Politics and are particularly severe upon Governor Hastings They gave offence to some of our East indian Nabobs and were answered in a strain of Welch asperity by Captain Joseph Price  who had complained of personal illtreatment from Mr Francis and who now attributed these Travels to an agent employed by him to traduce the character of Governor Hastings  MACKNIGHT REV JAMES DD  An eminent Clergyman of the Church of Scotland who is celebrated for his learned and useful labours in illustration and defence of the New Testament He published in his celebrated "Harmony of the four Gospels" in a quarto volume and in "The Truth of the Gospel History shewed" in a quarto volume Both of these works have experienced the success to which such laborious and masterly performances are entitled In Dr Macknight published in quarto "A new literal Translation from the original Greek of the Apostle Paul's first and second Epistles to the Thessalonians" which was intended as a specimen of a literal Translation of all the Apostolic Epistles with Commentaries Notes and Essays about which he had for many years been employed This complete work did not make its appearance till when it was published in four volumes quarto and added a new laurel to the brow of this respectable veteran in biblical literature  MACLAINE REV ARCHIBALD DD  A native of Scotland and late Minister of the English Church at the Hague He published so long ago as the year a single Sermon on the Death of the Prince of Orange In his masterly Translation of Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History made its first appearance in two volumes quarto It experienced a most favourable reception and was soon reprinted in six volumes octavo which is the form in which all the subsequent editions have been published A Supplement to the quarto edition containing the corrections additional notes and dissertations which had been added to the octavo edition was published by Dr Maclaine in quarto in Few publications upon their first appearance have been more generally read than Mr Soame Jenyns' View of the internal Evidence of Christianity Upon the occasion of this publication Dr Maclaine addressed a Series of Letters to that gentleman published in a duodecimo volume in These Letters were written to serve the best purposes of Christianity upon a due consideration of the distinguished eminence of Mr Jenyns as a writer of the singular mixture of piety wit error wisdom and paradox exhibited in his publication and of his defence of Christianity upon principles which would lead men to enthusiasm  or to scepticism according to their different dispositions His only publications since this time have been two Fast Sermons preached in and  MACLEOD HUGH DD  Professor of History in the University of Glasgow and author of  Casus Principis  or an Essay toward a History of the Principality of Scotland published in a quarto volume in  MACLEOD A  The author of "A warm Reply to Mr Burke's Letter" published in for which were there a Bedlam for raving authors as well as for common lunaticks he would undoubtedly deserve confinement He has also written a Series of incoherent letters entitled "The Bishop of Landaff's Apology for the Bible examined"  MACNALLY LEONARD ESQ  A native of Ireland educated for the profession of the Law He distinguished himself by his Speeches at the Shakspeare Tavern in favour of the Coalition in was for some years Editor  of the Public Ledger and has since that time we believe been concerned in other Newspapers In he wrote a sensible pamphlet entitled "The Claims of Ireland" but he has been chiefly distinguished as a dramatic writer His first piece "Retaliation" a farce was acted at Covent Garden in and received with uncommon applause Tristram Shandy a piece in two acts was favourably received in the following year and in the years and he produced Fashionable Levities a comedy and the April Fool a farce Mr Macnally displayed considerable ability in translating from the French of M Sedaine the historical Romance of  Richard Coeur de Lion  It was brought out at Drury Lane in and greatly preferred to a piece of the same name which had been represented at the other house  MACNAYR JAMES  Writer and author of a System of English Conveyancing adapted to Scotland which was published in quarto in as also of an Essay to demonstrate that contingent Debts cannot by law be ranked on Estates sequestered in Terms of the Statute George III Cap  MACNEILL HECTOR ESQ  This gentleman published in a sensible pamphlet entitled "Observations on the Treatment of the Negroes in Jamaica" He has since that time written '"The Harp" a legendary tale which gave occasion to the Scotch proverb "I'll never burn my harp for a woman" and which in the dress he has given it is a beautiful piece of sentimental poetry "Scotland's Skaith" a most elegant tale in verse and "The Waes of War" a very beautiful sequel of that tale  MACNEILLY REV J  A Dissenting Minister and author of an Appeal to the Legislature on the frequent Execution of Criminals a single Sermon and two volumes of Discourses on various subjects  MACPHERSON DAVID  The author of "Geographical Illustrations of Scottish History" in one volume quarto published in  MACREADY WILLIAM  Comedian of Covent Garden Theatre He is a native of Dublin and pleased the late Mr Macklin so much by representing Egerton in his "Man of the World" at that city that he exerted himself in his favour with the Covent Garden Manager and obtained for him his present engagement Mr Macready has of late become Playmender as well as Actor and has written "The Irishman In London" a farce and the Bank Note a comedy which were produced in and and are both very indifferent performances  MADAN RIGHT REV SPENCER DD  Lord Bishop of Peterborough Rector of West Harlton and Vicar of Haxay Lincolnshire His Lordship was formerly of Trinity College Cambridge and previously to his taking orders published in a Translation into English of Hugo Grotius on the Truth of Christianity This performance may boast the characteristics of familiarity perspicuity and elegance About the same time Dr Madan gained the Seatonian Prize for a poetical Essay on the Call of the Gentiles His Lordship  obtained the Bishopric of Bristol in and was translated to Peterborough two years afterward  MAHON LORD VISCOUNTSee Stanhope  MAINWARING REV JOHN  Lady Margaret's Professor in Divinity and late Fellow of St John's College Cambridge A gentleman highly esteemed for his classical knowledge and taste He published in a volume of Sermons on Several Occasions preached before the University most of which had appeared before singly These Discourses and the elegant prefixed Dissertation on that species of composition have been highly admired as polished specimens in their kind and place the genius and judgement of their author in a most respectable point of view Mr Mainwaring has also published a few occasional single Sermons since the above date and was engaged in a controversy with the late Bishop Hallifax about the proper way of quoting passages of Scripture  MAITLAND JAMES EARL OF LAUDERDALE IN THE KINGDOM OF SCOTLAND  This nobleman although an eyewitness to the horrors which attended the popular commotions in France has persevered in avowing himself the champion of democracy He published in "Letters to the Peers of Scotland" in an octavo volume a work too much of an inflammatory cast and his Lordship was not returned one of the sixteen Peers of Scotland in the present Parliament He has also published "Thoughts on Finance" a pamphlet and several of his Speeches have reached the press In his Lordship was made free of the Needlemakers Company and became an unsuccessful candidate for the office of Sheriff of the City of London  MALHAM REV JOHN  The author of "The Schoolmaster's complete Companion" a book of arithmetic published in Since that time he has published two Sermons on the King's Recovery sixteen Sermons on the most interesting subjects to Seamen a Word for the Bible written in and the Naval  Gazetteer or Seaman's complete Guide in two volumes octavo all of which are respectable performances  MALKIN BENJAMIN HEATH ESQ  Of Trinity College Cambridge The author of "Essays on Subjects connected with Civilization" published in an octavo volume in These Essays possess much ingenuity as well as many faults  MALONE EDMUND ESQ  Of Queen Ann Street East This gentleman a native of Ireland is the son of the late Attorney General of that Kingdom and brother to Lord Sunderlin He boasts a very high and deserved reputation in the literary world as an Editor of Shakspeare and appears to have devoted almost the whole of his time to the study and illustration of his immortal Author Mr Malone has written several Prologues and Epilogues and published in a very valuable Supplement in two octavo volumes to the edition of Shakspeare's Plays published in by Johnson and Stevens In he produced his edition of the Plays and Poems of Shakspeare in ten crown octavo  volumes which though inferior in splendour to the elegant edition since published by Mr Stevens has obtained its editor most distinguished credit for his assiduity and critical accumen Two years after the appearance of this work Mr Malone published a Letter to Dr Farmer relative to some distorted facts in a pamphlet entitled "Cursory Criticisms" on his edition of Shakspeare and in an octavo volume entitled "An Enquiry into the Authenticity of certain Miscellaneous Papers c attributed to Shakspeare" The latter of these performances had the honour of giving the finishing stroke to the infamous forgery of the Shaksperian MSS vide Ireland and if we extend our indulgence to some extraneous matter and a certain selfcomplacent sarcastic asperity flowing through the volume we cannot but pronounce it a most masterly piece of criticism and a very learned and entertaining book By this work Mr Malone made a pious offering to the Manes of his celebrated author and gave the public a new proof of his indefatigable diligence and accuracy Mr Malone was one of the executors of Sir Joshua Reynolds and published his works in two volumes quarto in prefixing an Account of the Life and Writings of the Author  MALTON THOMAS  When a King asked Euclid the mathematician whether he could not explain his art to him in a more compendious manner he was answered that there was no royal way to geometry Nevertheless the subject of our present article gave his first publication the title of "A Royal Road to Geometry" This useful work appeared in an octavo volume in and was republished with considerable additions and improvements in He has also published "A complete Treatise on Perspective in Theory and Practice" published in folio in and an Essay concerning the Publication of Works on Science and Literature by subscription As a writer on subjects of science Mr Malton's greatest fault appears to be his prolixity  MANNERS LADY  A native of Lehena in Ireland and the lady of Sir William Manners of BucminsterPark Leicestershire Her Ladyship published in a most elegantlyprinted volume of "Poems" chiefly of the ballad or elegiac kind These productions cannot lay claim to firstrate excellence in point of genius and poetry▪ yet the ease elegance taste  and charming simplicity which generally pervade them will lay almost every reader under a contribution of applause while the virtuous sentiments and amiable feelings which they discover in the writer may confirm them by a fair example in the rectitude of goodness  MANNING REV JAMES  Pastor of the united congregation of Dissenters in Exeter He published in "A Sketch of the Life and Writings of the Rev Micaiah Towgood" in an octavo volume and has since that time written a Funeral Sermon for the late Dr Rice Harris and "Exercises of Piety" translated from the French edition of the original German of Zollikofre They are all very respectable performances  MANNING THOMAS ESQ  Late of Caius College Cambridge and author of an Introduction to Arithmetic and Algebra in an octavo volume published in The completion of this design was intended in another vovolume but we have understood that owing to the nonadmission of the part already published as a lecturebook in the University this completion is a matter of great uncertainty For ourselves we  must own that the present publication appears to us from the manner of its execution to cast no new light or beauty on the branch of science of which it treats and to have been an unnecessary undertaking after the then recent labours of Mr Wood But the causes of authorship are many and various  MANTE THOMAS ESQ  Assistant Engineer during the Siege of the Havanna and Major of a Brigade in the Campaign of He published in A History of the War in North America and the Islands of the West Indies in one volume quarto and has also written a Translation of M Maizeroi's Treatise on the Use of Defensive Arms a Translation of M Maizeroi's Tactics Lucinda a novel and the Siege of Aubignè an historical tale  MARKHAM REV WILLIAM DD  Lord Archbishop of York Primate of England and Lord High Almoner to his Majesty His Grace was for some years Master of Westminster School and had the honour of being preceptor to their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and Duke of York from the year to His Grace's only publications have been several  occasional single Sermons and a  Concio ad Clerum  preached in A Sermon which he published preached in before the Society for propagating the Gospel in foreign Parts excited a good deal attention and was thought of an intolerant complexion  MARSH REV HERBERT BD  Fellow of St John's College Cambridge and a most diligent biblical Scholar and ingenious Critic who has deserved very highly of the learned world and of the theological Student in particular He has resided some years in a German University and published in at the Cambridge press in three octavo volumes a Translation into English of the first part of the fourth edition of Michaelis' Introduction to the New Testament a work which he has executed with most distinguished ability and which exhibits in our language a counterpart of the excellent performance of the German Professor whose name will be ever uttered with respect as long as learning is an object of esteem Mr Marsh has been for some time employed in preparing the remainder of this valuable work for the press He has also published the Substance of two excellent Discourses preached before the University of Cambridge in the one on the Usefulness and Necessity of Theological Leaning to  those who are designed for Holy Orders the other on the Authenticity of the five Books of Moses And in he printed at Leipzig an octavo volume of Letters to the late Mr Archdeacon Travis in confirmation of the opinion that a Greek MS in the public Library at Cambridge is one of the seven quoted by R Stephens at John v a volume which notwithstanding the whimsical appearance of an algebraical theorem which he has introduced for determining the identity of MSS and which has drawn a smile from some of his readers is a new proof of his learning diligence and accuracy  MARSHALL WILLIAM  An eminent writer on the subject of Agriculture than whom none have done more toward diffusing the important knowledge of Rural Oeconomy He was according to his own account born a farmer bred to traffic and returned to the plow His first publication was "Minutes of Agriculture made on a Farm of three hundred Acres of various Soils near Croydon in Surry" which appeared in a quarto volume in He has since that time written Experiments in Agriculture and on the Weather in a quarto volume the Rural Oeconomy of Norfolk the Rural Oeconony of Yorkshire the Rural Oeconomy of Gloucestershire the Rural  Oeconomy of the Midland Counties and the Rural Oeconomy of the West of England each in two volumes octavo Beside these works he has published a Review of Mr Knight's Poem "The Landscape" and "Planting and Rural Ornament" in two volumes octavo  MARSHALL JANE  This lady has written Clarinda

Bookseller in Holborn and a Dissenting Preacher He has written several Pieces in Answer to Mr Winchester's Doctrine of limited Punishments in a future State  MARTIN REV JOHN  A Baptist Preacher and Minister of a Chapel in Store Street Bedford Square Most of his writings have been of a controversial nature on trifling  and temporary subjects His principal polemic work is a Series of Letters to the Rev Mr Horsey in Defence of Adult Baptism He has also beside several occasional single Sermons and trifling devotional tracts published "The Conquest of Canaan" Thoughts on Faith in two parts a Speech on the Repeal of such Parts of the Test and Corporation Acts as affect conscientious Dissenters a volume of Sermons on the Character of Christ an History of the Sufferings of M de Marolles Letters on Animal Magnetism and his own Life  MARTIN JOHN ESQ  Attorney of the Courts of England and Solicitor of the Courts of Scotland The author of "The Marriage Law of Scotland stated" an octavo

Proceedings against him on a Charge of High Treason Mr Martin was discharged from the King's Bench Prison on the occasion referred to in the latter of these publications  by a warrant of Privy Council His writings display considerable abilities  MARTYN REV THOMAS BD FRS  Of Sidney Sussex College Cambridge and Professor of Botany in the University to which situation he was elected in the year He is one of those patriotic gentlemen who established the Society for the improvement of naval architecture He has published a Sermon for Addenbrooke's Hospital an Address to the Inhabitants of the Parish

Antiquities of Herculaneum published in quarto in in association with Mr John Lettice  Catalogus Horti Botanici Cantabrigiensis  Elements of Natural History Letters on the Elements of Botany from the French of J J Rousseau with additional letters Botanical Plates illustrative of Linnaeus' System of Vegetables a Tour through Italy published in an octavo volume in a Dictionary of the Language of Botany published in an octavo volume in and Aranei or the Natural History of Spiders a large quarto volume  MASERES FRANCIS ESQ FRS  Cursitor Baron of the Court of Exchequer and formerly AttorneyGeneral of Quebec He is a very distinguished writer particularly in the mathematical department He was educated under Mr Wooddeson late of KingstonuponThames and at Clare Hall Cambridge In the year he had the honour of obtaining with Dr Porteus Bishop of London the Chancellor's Medals at Cambridge on their first institution Baron Maseres' first publication was a Dissertation on the Use of the Negative Sign in Algebra which was published in quarto in and he soon afterward wrote "Elements of plain Trigonomety in an octavo volume In he published an Account of the Proceedings of the British and other Protestant Inhabitants of Quebec in order to obtain an House of Assembly in that province an octavo volume and two years afterward vol I of the Canadian Freeholder which was completed in three octavo volumes and consists of three Dialogues between an Englishman and a Frenchman settled in Canada The latter of these works is an Inquiry concerning the King's sole legistative Authority over countries subdued by the British Arms and ceded to the British Crown and it has been said that the character of the Canadian Freeholder  is sunk in that of the English Lawyer and Historian Baron Maseres has also published an excellent work in two volumes quarto on the Principles of the Doctrine of LifeAnnuities a short Enquiry into the Extent of the Power of Juries on Trials for criminal Writings the Moderate Reformer a pamphlet on the correction of abuses in the Church Establishment Mr James Bernoulli's Doctrine of Permutations and Combinations and some other useful mathematical Tracts in an octavo volume and  Scriptores Logarithmici  in three volumes quarto published in a most valuable work consisting of several curious Tracts on the Nature and Construction of Logarithms with others on the Binomial Theorem and other subjects connected with the Doctrine of Logarithms The latter of these undertakings and the manner of its execution leave us in doubt whether most to applaud the liberality or the knowledge of the editor  MASKELYNE REV NEVIL DD FRS  Astronomer Royal an appointment which he obtained in the year and a very celebrated Mathematician and natural Philosopher He was formerly a Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge and went to Barbadoes under the appointment of the Board of Longitude for the purpose of trying Mr Harrison's marine timekeeper according to the Act  of the th of Queen Anne His first publication was a quarto pamphlet with a view to the improvement of practical navigation entitled "The British Mariner's Guide" published in Four years after this he published by order of the Commissioners of Longitude an Account of Mr John Harrison's Watch In were published by the President and Council of the Royal Society at the public expence his Tables for computing the apparent Places of the fixed Stars and reducing Observations of the Planets in a folio volume Two years after this he produced the first volume in folio of his Astronomical Observations made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich from the year the continuation of which to within a few years of the present time has since appeared This important publication is introduced into the world in obedience to his Majesty's Command in the same manner as that last mentioned In Dr Maskelyne presented the world with the late Mr Michael Taylor's invaluable Tables of Logarithms That indefatigable labourer sunk under his task and died when only five pages of his work remained unfinished bequeathing the world a most remarkable monument of human industry Dr Maskelyne had always encouraged the design and now took upon himself to finish the work to which he added a most masterly Introduction rendering the whole a very complete performance  MASON RT HON JOHN MONCK  A Privy Counsellor and a Member of Parliament in the Kingdom of Ireland Beside some Prologues and Epilogues he has written ingenious Comments on the Edition of Shakspeare's Plays which were published in an octavo volume in  MASON REV HENRY COX  Chaplain to Lord Onslow and a Methodist He is a son of the late Mr Mason a Watchmaker who wrote Notes upon Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress the Holy War c He has published some single Discourses and is now engaged in a Commentary on the Bible  MATHIAS THOMAS JAMES ESQ  Clerk to her Majesty's Treasurer and a gentleman of most distinguished character as an elegant scholar and a worthy man He was educated at Eton School took the degree of Bachelor of Arts at Cambridge in and was for some time Fellow of Trinity College His first publication was a  quarto pamphlet in consisting of Runic Odes imitated from the Norse Tongue Two years afterward he published in a small octavo volume an Essay on the Evidence External and Internal relating to the Poems attributed to Thomas Rowley This performance contains a general view of the whole controversy respecting those poems and is justly entitled to the character of a candid and comprehensive Essay We believe that Dr Glynn of Cambridge gave Mr Mathias some assistance in this work In these latter days Mr Mathias has amused himself and the public with several satirical pieces which while the times are peculiarly in need of such effusions do the highest honour to his wit and talents It is not without some scruples that we speak on this subject as his publications of this cast have always been anonymous and the author has been studiously concealed Yet when we reflect that in every such instance his exertions have done him the utmost credit both as a scholar and as a man and that it is our duty to report our information on these occasions to the public we trust we may proceed To his pen we have little hesitation in ascribing the three following excellent poetical pamphlets viz "The Political Dramatist of the House of Commons in " a Pair of Epistles to Dr Randolph and the Earl of Jersey and the Imperial Epistle from Kien Long to George III as also a Letter to the Marquis of Buckingham chiefly on the Subject of the numerous  emigrant French Priests by a Layman The author of the celebrated satirical poem THE PURSUITS OF LITERATURE  It has been said that more persons than one were concerned in this publication and the poetical part has been attributed to the Rev Mr Mansell Public Orator at Cambridge Upon this we will only remark that he is a very intimate friend of Mr Mathias We also refer the reader to a note in page of our first volume  in four parts of which the first was published in remained long unknown We subjoin this excellent performance to the above list from a conviction that considered in every possible point of view it cannot but redound most highly to the credit of the writer The cause of literature has never been supported in a day of danger and perversion upon principles more excellent or with powers better adapted to their object The author of this Poem may claim the character of a Noble Patriot in Literature of a man whose Piety and Orthodoxy are an Ornament to Human Nature and the Christian Faith of a Politician whose sentiments and example are an Honour to the Government and Ministry under which he lives of a Scholar whose attainments are of FirstRate Excellence and of a Satirist whose keenest arrow is always directed by the hand of a Gentleman The few false opinions and false judgements which this poem contains are trifling indeed when compared with its numerous merits The various and extensive learning exhibited in the Notes is conveyed in so lively a manner as to delight almost every reader More  pains however might perhaps with propriety have been taken in polishing the style of the notes and we think the ingenious author  After expressing the above sentiments we hope we may be allowed to refer the author of this poem to the article EDWARD KING in this work and likewise to express our surprise that he should confer on Mr Sulivan's View of Nature the character of  a work of labour and of general utility digested from original writers with judgement c  Could this be because it came from the same shop  might as well have left Mr Stevens to tell his story of the Peg  MAURICE REV THOMAS AM  Historiographer we believe to the East India Company and a very learned ingenious and diligent Scholar He was educated at University College Oxford afterward became Chaplain to the th Regiment and lived for some years at Woodford in Essex He published in a quarto volume of "Poems and Miscellaneous Pieces" with a free Translation of the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles Most of these poems had appeared in print before separately "Netherby" the oldest of them was published in They possess much merit but did not obtain their author that credit which his latter writings have acquired him About a year previously to this volume Mr Maurice had printed a Fast Sermon which we believe is his only publication in the class of divinity In he wrote  Ierne Rediviva  an  ode inscribed to the Volunteers of Ireland and two years afterward "Westminster Abbey" an elegiac poem both of which pieces increased his reputation as a poet In Mr Maurice published Panthea a tragedy from a story in Xenophon which did not add greatly to his fame and relinquishing here the line of authorship which he had hitherto traced he has since acquired the greatest eminence and distinction in another track This is a circumstance which cannot but appear surprising for what reader with all his approbation of Mr Maurice's abilities as an historian can help yielding the palm to his poetical talents In the year he published a Letter addressed to the Directors of the East India Company containing proposals for printing a History of the Revolutions of the Empire of Hindostan from the earliest Ages and has since that time published "Indian Antiquities" in six volumes octavo the two first of which appeared in and the first volume in quarto of the History of Hindostan published in The former of these works is introductory to and illustrative of the latter Although it was sanctioned by the approbation of the East India Company and Sir William Jones it obtained only  a dozen  subscribers in the course of twelve months At present however the merit of the author of these works is well known to the public and has obtained him a most distinguished reputation His erudition diligence and ingenuity are very remarkable  His greatest fault is an imagination too florid and poetical for his undertaking and not sufficiently reducible to method and the power of condensing In Mr Maurice published in quarto a beautiful elegiac Poem sacred to the Memory and Virtues of Sir William Jones of which it is no mean praise to say that it is superior to Mr Hayley's Poem on the same occasion  MAYO REV CHARLES LLB  Rector of BechingStoke and Hewish in the county of Wilts He published in in a folio volume "A Chronological History of the European States with their Discoveries and Settlements from the Treaty of Nimeguen in to the Close of " a useful work  MEARES JOHN ESQ  An Officer in the Navy who particularly distinguished himself by his spirited conduct toward the Spaniards at Nootka Sound He has published in a large quarto volume "Voyages made in the Years and from China to the Northwest Coast of America" In this volume he makes some severe reflections on the conduct of Captains Portlock and Dixon The latter wrote a Reply to  these reflections was answered by Mr Meares and replied to his Answer  MEDLEY REV SAMUEL  A Methodist Preacher at Liverpool He engaged in in a controversy with the Rev Richard de Courcy on Baptism and has also published the Spiritual Merchant a Sermon and a volume of Hymns  MEILAN REV MARK ANTHONY  This gentleman published in by way of appeal to the public his "Dramatic Works" consisting of three tragedies which had very properly been rejected by the Managers of both Theatres He has also published an English Grammar a Translation of Berquin's Friend of Youth in twelve small volumes a Translation of Telemachus and Sermons for Children in three duodecimo volumes Most of these are bad but the last bad indeed  MELMOTH WILLIAM ESQ  This literary Veteran has been distinguished for more than fifty years as one of the most elegant scholars and classical writers of his time Few authors have contributed so much to the improvement of our style or have exhibited in their works such complete models of elegant writing such specimens of correct choice and perspicuous arrangement of words and of harmonious construction of periods Mr Melmoth is a son of the late eminent Advocate of the same name who wrote an admirable treatise on the great importance of a Religious Life He died in and it is said of him 'few ever passed a more useful none a more blameless life' The first publication of the subject of this article was "The Letters of Sir Thomas Fitzosborne on several Subjects" in an octavo volume These admired Letters made their first appearance about the year and have experienced that favourable reception and general circulation to which their very sterling merit entitles them Mr Melrmoth's elegant Translation of Pliny's Epistles made its first appearance in two octavo volumes in about four years before the Translation by the Earl of Orrery to which it was justly preferred In he published in three octavo volumes a Translation of Cicero's Letters to his Friends with Remarks  in which the  patriot character  ofth a celebrated Roman is justly questioned and in and Translations of Cicero's Cato and Laelius each in an octavo volume with Remarks These finished performances have acquired Mr Melmoth the greatest reputation possible as an elegant and accurate scholar They will probably speak for him while Roman and English eloquence can be united Yet when we consider them as specimens of translation we cannot help thinking that he is too often led away by the vanity of improving upon his author that he frequently sacrifices his original to a false refinement and an overspun delicacy of phrase and lastly that he has too much of what the Greeks express by the forcible term  In the year after a long repose Mr Melmoth was constrained to resume his pen upon the occasion of a very unprovoked attack from Mr Bryant in his Treatise on the Truth of the Christian Religion The grounds of this attack were Mr Melmoth's remarks in his Translation of Pliny's Letters respecting Trajan's persecution of the Christians in Bythinia and he wrote a pamphlet in Answer to Mr Bryant in which he vindicated himself with great ability and proved his point Two years after this Mr Melmoth published "Memoirs of a late eminent Advocate" his father in a thin octavo volume which is a tribute of filial piety not less elegant than merited  MELMOTH COURTNEY See Pratt  MERRY ROBERT ESQ AM  This gentleman is a native of the Metropolis and son of a late Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company He was born in the year was educated at Harrow under the private tuition of Dr Parr and became afterward a Member of Christ  s College Cambridge and of Lincoln's Inn Upon the death of his father he bought a commission in the Horseguards and was for several years Adjutant and Lieutenant to the first troop commanded by Lord Lothian He afterward quitted this service and travelled for some years on the continent Mr Merry made a long stay at Florence and was elected a Member of the famous Academy Della Crusca A few years ago he married the celebrated actress Miss Brunton who then quitted the stage During his residence at Florence Mr Merry was a principal contributor to the "Florence Miscellany" which was written by a few English of both sexes who had met by chance at Florence and was superintended by Mrs Piozzi In he published in London "Paulina or the Russian Daughter" a poetical tale founded on fact and in the year following "Diversity"  a poem He has also published "The Laurel of Liberty" a poem "Lorenzo" a tragedy represented at Covent Garden an Ode for the th of July which was performed at the Crown and Anchor Tavern "Fenelon or the Nuns of Cambray" a serious drama altered from the French and "The Pains of Memory" a poem published in An Ode on the Recovery of his Majesty recited by Mrs Siddons at a Gala given by the Subscribers to Brookes' Club as well as a comicopera entitled "The Magician no Conjuror" acted four nights in the winter of are also to be attributed to his pen On the th of June Mr Merry sent a pretty little poem entitled the Adieu and Recall to Love to the World a newspaper of the day with the signature Della Crusca It was answered by a poem entitled the Pen signed Anna Matilda The correspondence thus begun was from poetical sympathy kept up at intervals for two years Many new correspondents came forward but the writers remained long unknown to the public and to one another Time at last discovered Della Crusca and Anna Matilda to be Mr Merry and Mrs Robinson who had an interview toward the conclusion of the correspondence In the mean time the poetry some of which is very pretty attracted a good deal of notice and was reprinted in volumes under the title of "The Poetry of the World" It has now reached a fourth edition in two duodecimo  volumes entitled "The British Album" Mr Merry's pieces in this collection have the greatest claim to distinction of any His poem "Diversity" and "Ambitions Vengeance" a tragicdrama are to be found in these volumes In speaking of Mr Merry's pretensions to same as a poet we must observe that he has been loudly decried and stigmatised by an elegant satirist of the present day vide William Gifford Esq who has said of one of his pieces  The Laurel of Liberty  that it is distinguished by "Downright nonsense Downright frigidity and downright doggerel" We own that his false glitter his negligence and his obscurity are frequently highly reprehensible yet cannot but allow that his pretensions to poetical merit are often great and striking while the spirit of liberty and benevolence which breathes through his writings seems ardent and sincere His poem entitled "The Pains of Memory" has been preferred by many readers to Mr Rogers' popular poem "The Pleasures of Memory"  MICHELL CHARLES ESQ  Of Forcett The author of an octavo volume published in entitled "Principles of Legislation" which does him very considerable credit  MIDDLETON REV ERASMUS  A Methodist Clergyman who has published a Sermon on the Death of Thomas Jackson "Biographia Evangelica" in four volumes octavo the style of which is peculiarly disagreeable a Dictionary of Arts and Sciences which is but an indifferent compilation and a Sermon preached at the funeral of Mr W Binns  MILES WILLIAM  A wellknown political Pamphleteer sufficiently addicted to scurrility He is supposed to have been not long ago a secret agent of the British Government He has written a Letter to the Prince of Wales on a second Application to Parliament to discharge Debts c which has been a good deal rend "The Conduct of France toward Great Britain examined" a Letter to the Duke of Grafton a Vindication of that Letter a Letter to Earl Stanhope "The Expediency of prescribing Bounds to the Russian Empire" a Letter to Henry Duncombe Esq on the Subject of Mr Burke's Letter to a noble Lord and "Authentic Correspondence with M le Brun" c  MILLAR JOHN ESQ  Professor of Civil and Scottish Law in the University of Glasgow He published in a quarto volume of Observations concerning the Distinction of Ranks in Society and in a very ingenious Historical View of the English Government in a quarto volume  MILLER JOHN  The author of an Illustration of the Sexual System of Linnaeus which was first published in twenty folio numbers at a guinea each and which obtained the approbation of Linnaeus himself At the request of many Students in Botany and particularly or the younger Linnè he was induced in to publish the Plates of this work reduced to an octavo size Other engagements intervening ten years elapsed before his Illustration of the Termini Botanici was ready for publication The whole constitutes a very valuable work  MILLER JAMES ESQ  Professor of Chemistry to the College NewWindsor Nova Scotia and Mineralogist General to British America The author of a very valuable Synopsis of Mineralogy in thirteen large folio sheets published in which procured him the above honours  MILLER REV WILLIAM  A Dissenting Minister of High Wycomb He has published "Catholic Baptism examined" "The Paedobaptist Mode of administering the Baptismal Ordinance defended" and a Funeral Sermon for his Father  MILNE REV COLIN LLD  Rector of both the Churches at Deptford He is a popular Preacher and celebrated as a Botanist In he published a Botanical Dictionary in duodecimo and has since that time written "Institutes of Botany" in two parts quarto a Supplement to his Botanical Dictionary and vol I in octavo of "Indigenous Botany" a most useful  book published in in association with MR Alexander Gordon Dr Mine has also beside several single Sermons published a volume of Sermons which appeared in These Discourses are excessively tedious and the Dr appears to greater advantage in print as a cultivator of the flowers of the earth than of those of rhetoric  MILNER REV JOSEPH AM  Late Master of the Grammar School at KingstonuponHull and now Vicar of the High Church in that Borough He is a classical Scholar of considerable eminence and has sent forth many men into the world who do him the highest credit as a teacher He was educated at Catherine Hall Cambridge is brother to the present Master of Queen's College and resigned the above School upon being presented with the Vicarage in vacated by the death of the Rev Mr Clarke▪ Mr Milner's first publication Account of Christianity considered together with some Strictures on Humes' Dialogues concerning Natural Religion" a performance which though written with the most laudable intention possible is perhaps too angry and dogmatical to entitle him to much credit In he published "Essays on several religious Subjects chiefly tending to illustrate the Scripture Doctrine of the Influence  of the Holy Spirit" in a duodecimo volume These Essays were chiefly intended as an answer to Mr Ludlam's Theological Essays Since that time he has published two volumes in octavo of a History of the Church of Christ Upon the whole it is perhaps to be lamented in the case of Mr Milner that with abilities and knowledge like his he should not have been more assiduous in cultivating the character of a wellbred and attractive writer  MILNER REV JOHN FAS  A Roman Catholic Clergyman of a private Chapel in Winchester He published a sensible Discourse on his Majesty's Recovery in which be has introduced a very elaborate and truly jesuitical justification of the principles and conduct of modern Catholics Mr Milner has also published the Funeral Oration of Louis XVI at the funeral service performed by the French Clergy of the King's house Winchester Inquiry into the Existence and Character of St George Patron of England He is an occasional correspondent with the Gentleman's Magazine and has been severely reprimanded by the author of "The Pursuits of Literature" for a pamphlet which he wrote in entitled "A Reply to  the Report published by the Cisalpine Club on the protestation c c"  MILNS WILLIAM  Member of St Mary Hall Oxford and Master of the City Commercial School George Yard Lombard Street He published in in an octavo volume "The wellbred Scholar" a useful collection of practical Essays on the best methods of improving the taste and assisting the exertions of youth in their literary pursuits  MINIFIESee Gunning  MITFORD WILLIAM ESQ MP FRS  Lieutenant Colonel of the South Hampshire Militia and brother to Sir John Mitford Solicitor General to his Majesty This gentleman is one of those characters in the republic of letters which we contemplate with peculiar satisfaction He has devoted the leisure of a military life to the cultivation of letters has served the truest interests of the literary community by bringing to classic regions fresh accessions of light and certainty and has always preserved in his writings a manliness of deportment  and strength of character which entitle him to the highest admiration as a citizen of that community ford and has bestowed much time and attention on his favourite study of antiquities His chief work the History of Greece is a performance which does him infinite credit To those who are acquainted with the intricacy of many parts of Grecian History with the extreme difficulty of collecting the scattered members of it of detecting the supposititious and doubtful among what is related by inferior or later authors and of ascertaining and arranging the genuine and lastly without the assistance of invention of forming from parts so broken and dispersed a harmonizing whole he will appear highly to deserve the character of a learned and accurate historian His History of Greece is not the work of a closet critic or a monkish philosopher but owes its existence to a most comprehensive mind and correct judgement happily blended with extensive knowledge and an acquaintance with the modes and manners of life He frequently and his union of characters soldier seaman statesman scholar poet and philosopher while his just estimation of  his  invaluable guides Thucydides and Xenophon increases our admiration of the soldierphilosopher who is our own Much of the earlier part of this valuable work was written in camps and in quarters during the American war It was  first published by single quarto volumes of which the first appeared in two years previous to the History by Dr Gillies vide that name At present three of these volumes are published and the third edition was printed in octavo each of the original volumes forming two of these Ten years previous to the first appearance of this work Mr Mitford had published anonymously an Essay upon to illustrate that of the English Language and in he wrote a pamphlet entitled "Considerations on the Opinion stated by the Lords of the Committee of Council in a Representation to the King upon the Corn Laws that Great Britain is unable to produce Corn sufficient for its own Consumption c"  In his most distinguished character as an author we assert without hesitation of Mr Mitford that the industry with which he has collected his materials from ancient sources and brought together from distant quarters whatever might serve to which he discovers in comparing the various representations given by different authors of the same facts his perfect originality of thought and expression the display of general knowledge which he so agreably and judiciously introduces his comprehension of mind in the arrangement of the whole his found learning his strength of judgement his diligent investigation all unite in entitling  him to the first place among the historians of Greece It is unfortunate that amid so much perfection there should be found a single blemish Yet the style of Mr Mitford can certainly not be said to possess that grace and polish which would display to most advantage the many excellencies of his writings With the generality of readers the beauties of style are of the highest consideration Could Mr Mitford boast this among his other superiorities few indeed would be the historians who would have greater claims to distinction  MOIR REV JOHN  A native of Scotland formerly a Clergyman of the Church of Scotland and now of the Church of England He is a writer of considerable ability but owing to a large family and a small curacy we believe he has felt severely the hardships of poverty He published in a duodecimo volume of "Discourses on Practical Subjects" and in an octavo volume of "Sermons on some of the most useful and interesting Subjects in Religion and Life" A History of the Life and public Services of Mr Fox and a History of Transactions in India from each in an octavo volume have also been attributed to him Mr Moir is moreover supposed to have been concerned in some of the Newspapers and has lately written  some single Sermons and an octavo volume entitled "Preventive Policy" The latter of these works aims at an humble defence of our whole establishment in every form of property and distinction it involves and as its drift is to guard the interests of the opulent a copy was left at many of the principal houses in the Metropolis in the hope that some consideration might be deemed due to the labour of the author There is an affected profundity in many of the reflections of Mr Moir but upon the whole his style of writing is good and his talents appear to be very respectable  MOISES REV EDWARD AM  Of Trinity College Cambridge and Master of the Royal Grammar School at NewcastleuponTyne He published in "The Persian Interpreter" in a quarto volume which is a shameful plagiarism from the excellent Persian Grammar of Sir William Jones  MONBODDO LORDSee Burnet  MONK JOHN ESQ  Of Bear's Combe near Kingsbridge Devonshire Late a Lieutenant of Dragoons and author of an Agricultural Dictionary consisting of Extracts from the most celebrated authors and papers in three volumes octavo which is by no means a complete performance  MONRO ALEXANDER ESQ MD  Professor of Medicine Anatomy and Surgery in the University of Edinburgh c and a Physician of the highest reputation He is the son of a celebrated character of the same name whose "Osteology" is so universally esteemed and who likewise formerly held the above Professorship In he published his father's works in a quarto volume and two years afterward "Observations on the Structure and Functions of the Nervous System" in a royal folio volume illustrated with plates In he published "The Structure and Phisiology of Fishes explained and compared with those of Man and other Animals in a royal folio volume and three years afterward a Description of all the  Bursae Mucosae  of the Human Body He has since that time written a quarto pamphlet  of Experiments on the Nervous System with Opium and Metalline Substances  MONRO DONALD ESQ MD FRS  A Physician in London Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and brother to the subject of the preceeding article He wrote the Life of the late Dr Monro prefixed to the quarto volume of his works mentioned in our last memoir and beside several smaller medical Treatises has written

 MONTAGU MRS  Of Upper Berkley Street Portman Square A lady of considerable literary accomplishments and whose charity in bestowing an annual Mayday Dinner upon the Chimney Sweepers is well known Her maiden name was Robinson and she was nearly related to the late Primate of Ireland She has written "An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakspeare compared with the Greek and French dramatic Poets with some Remarks  upon the Misrepresentations of M de Voltaire" in octavo the first edition of which was published in and a second in This performance has obtained her much applause  MONTAGU MATTHEW ROBINSON ESQ  This gentleman's original name was Robinson He is brother to the subject of the preceeding article and was a Member of the two last Parliaments Mr Montagu has written several political Pamphlets which notwithstanding their peculiarity of style do him great credit Among them are "Considerations on the Measures carrying on with respect to the British Colonies in North America" published in "A farther Examination of our American Measures" published two years afterward "Peace the best Policy" published in "The Dangerous Situation of England" published in and "Friendly Remarks on Mr Pitt's Administration by a near Observer" published in His signature formerly was M Robinson M Esq  MONTUCCI ANTONIO LLD  A native of Sienna and a Teacher of Languages He has published

Bhow during the Confederacy in India against the Nawab Tippco Sultan Bahadur published in a quarto volume in  MOORE JOHN ESQ MD  This gentleman whose writings have obtained him a great and wellmerited celebrity in the literary world was formerly travellingpreceptor to the Duke of Hamilton He published in a View of Society and Manners in France Switzerland and Germany in two octavo volumes a work which was favourably received and which gained its author no small share of credit Two years after this he wrote a View of Society and Manners in Italy which as the observations it contains occurred in the same tour so is it to be considered as  a continuation of the above work in merit as well as subject These volumes have seen several editions since their first publication In Dr Moore published an octavo volume of "Medical Sketches" and three years afterward his celebrated novel entitled "Zeluco" in two volumes octavo Dr Moore accompanied the Earl of Lauderdale to Paris in and was present during the horrid massacre of the d of September Soon after his return to England he published a Journal during his Residence in France in two volumes octavo which is a most valuable and authentic work and in he produced a View of the Causes and Progress of the French Revolution in two more octavo volumes He has since that time written Edward a novel in two octavo volumes which like Zeluco exhibits various views of human nature but its characters are more indigenous to our own soil It is hardly necessary for us to add of so popular a writer as Mr Moore that his works discover him to possess great insight into human nature and that happy union of acute discernment with a lively imagination by which he is enabled to describe its intricacies with the greatest pleasantry  MOORE REV CHARLES AM  Rector of Cuxton and Vicar of BoughtonBlean Kent and formerly Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge This gentleman published a Visitation Sermon in and in "A full Inquiry into the Subject of Suicide" in two volumes quarto which is an elaborate useful and entertaining work  MOORE JAMES ESQ  Member of the Surgeons' Company He published in in an octavo pamphlet "A Method of preventing or diminishing Pain in several Operations of Surgery" ie by compressing the nerves going to the limb In the year he obtained the prizemedal given by the Lyceum Medicum Londinense for an ingenious Dissertation on the Process of Nature in filling up the Cavities healing Wounds c in the Human Body He has also written an Essay on the Materia Medica in which the theories of Dr Cullen with some opinions of Mr Hunter and other celebrated writers are considered in a very sensible manner  MORE HANNAH  Formerly a Schoolmistress at Bristol and a lady justly celebrated for her literary accomplishments The elegant simplicity of her poems and the pious and virtuous sentiments which they inculcate come with peculiar grace from a female pen Her first publication was a pastoral drama entitled "The Search of Happiness" which appeared in It was written at the age of eighteen for some female friends who played the respective characters in private parties Though the plot of this little piece is perfectly inartificial the poetry which it contains does infinite credit to the powers of such early years and it experienced a very favourable reception In the following year Mrs More published the Inflexible Captive founded on the story of Regulus an excellent tragedy considered as a literary composition and which was acted one night at Bath Sir Eldred of the Bower and the Bleeding Rock two beautiful legendary tales were published together in quarto in The latter is in the manner of Ovid and the pretty fiction at the conclusion had its origin from a rock near the author's residence in Somersetshire whence a crimson stream flows occasioned by the red strata over which the water makes its way from the mountains Mrs More has also written an Ode  to Dragon Mr Garrick's HouseDog Essays on various Subjects principally designed for young Ladies an octavo volume the tragedy of Percy founded on the Gabrielle de Vergy of M de Belloy the Fatal Falsehood a tragedy Sacred Dramas the subjects of which are taken from the Bible and Sensibility a poem Florio and the Bas Bleu two poems Slavery a poem and Remarks on the Speech of M Dupont made in the National Convention of France on the Subjects of Religion and public Education The profits of the last of these publications were to be given to the French emigrant clergy Each of these performances bears genuine marks of the sterling abilities and proficiency of their author United they entitle her to high eminence indeed among female writers Mrs More wrote the preface to Anne Yearsley's the Bristol Milkmaid poems and is supposed to be concerned in several little pieces distributed among the poor by a society under the active patronage of the worthy Bishop of London The useful little tract "An Estimate of the Religion of the Fashionable World" is also attributed to her  MORGAN WILLIAM ESQ FRS  Actuary to the Equitable Assurance Office Black friars This gentleman is nephew to the late celebrated Dr Price His abilities as a calculator  are of the fist distinction and had he been satisfied with the exercise of those abilities in the advancement of his fortune without employing them to calculate the possible calamities of his country in a day when she stood in need of encouragement rather than increase of apprehension he had been esteemed by her better citizens a more useful and respectable member of her community He published in "The Doctrine of Annuities and Assurances on Lives and Survivorships" in an octavo volume which is a very ingenious performance About a year after this he was engaged in a philosophical controversy with Dr Adair Crawford on the subject of Animal Heat and wrote a pamphlet entitled "An Examination" of that gentleman's Theory In he published a Review of Dr Price's Writings on the Subject of the Finances of this Kingdom in an octavo pamphlet which has been reprinted Mr Morgan has since that time written "Facts" addressed to the serious attention of the people respecting the expence of the War and the state of the national Debt "Additional Facts" on the same subject and "An Appeal" to the people on the alarming state of the public Finances and public Credit In these pamphlets Mr Morgan has made many very questionable positions and has throughout strained every nerve of his ingenuity and knowledge of public affairs to become a most terrifying alarmist We are sorry that his abilities should  ever have been prostituted upon so pernicious and unpatriotic a purpose The "Facts" were extremely well answered in a most gentlemanly pamphlet by Nicholas Vansittart Esq MP  MORGAN REV GC  A Dissenting Clergyman formerly of Hackney at present of Southgate He is brother to the subject of the preceeding article and keeps an academy for young gentlemen Mr Morgan is author of "Lectures on Electricity" in two duodecimo volumes published in a work far from creditable to a natural philosopher who would be thought a superior electrician  MORGAN REV THOMAS  A Dissenting Minister and one of the compilers of the new volume of Hymns introduced among the presbyterian congregations In this selection several of Dr Watts' beautiful compositions are wretchedly mutilated and he is made to utter sentiments which he never professed Mr Morgan is also supposed since the death of Dr Kippis to superintend the New Annual Register  MORRES RIGHT HON HERVEY VISCOUNT MOUNTMORRES IN THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND FRS MRIA  This nobleman is an adherent to the popular cause in the Irish House of Lords and has paid a good deal of attention to the politics of this country He has shewn a Very commendable zeal in the acquisition of political and historical knowledge In his Lordship was an unsuccessful candidate with Lord Viscount Mahon since Earl Stanhope for the City of Westminster and in he made several Speeches against the Coalition in the popular meetings of the electors of that city He took an active and able part in the House of Lords of Ireland in the year upon the occasion of the address to the Prince of Wales His Lordship published in the year a Speech intended to have been spoken on the apellant jurisdiction of the House of Lords of Ireland and three years afterward a pamphlet entitled "Impartial Reflections upon the Question for Equalizing the Duties upon the Trade between Great Britain and Ireland" He has since written "The Danger of the Political Balance of Europe" a translation from the French of the King of Sweden which reached a second edition the History of  the principal Transactions of the Irish Parliament from to in two volumes octavo the Letters of Themistocles in a duodecimo volume which were published originally in a London Newspaper the Crisis a collection of political essays in an octavo volume which were originally published in the same manner an excellent historical Dissertation upon the Origin Suspension and Revival of the Judicature and Independency of the Irish Parliament and impartial Reflections on the present Crisis published in A new Version of Herodotus by his Lordship has been announced  MORRIS CHARLES ESQ  An Officer in the Army highly celebrated for his powers of conviviality He has written many obscene Songs which have been collected in an octavo pamphlet They abound with more exquisite ideas than are often to be found in so small a compass and entitle their author to the credit of very uncommon abilities It is to be lamented however that talents so shining should not have been directed to nobler purposes than the perversion of young minds by the most studied and unblushing obscenity The pamphlet as was to be expected has seen no less than fourteen editions and could Captain Morris ascertain the real evil he has done  to society by such a publication it might greatly contribute to tinge with a browner shade the evening of his life The highest praise which the celebrated Thomson has received is that his works contained  No line which dying he could wish to blot  MORRIS THOMAS ESQ  This gentleman is an elder brother of the subject of the preceeding article and likewise a Captain in the Army He published in an entertaining volume of Miscellanies in prose and verse and in the year following a general View of the Life and Writings of the Rev David Williams an octavo pamphlet written in a high strain of panegyric Since that time he has written Quashy or the Coalblack Maid a poetical tale bearing reference to the slave trade Mr Morris is a member of the Literary Fund and when Richard III was acted by the members for its benefit at the Haymarket he undertook to personate the tyrant  MORRIS VALENTINE ESQ  Formerly CaptainGeneral GovernorinChief c of the Island of St Vincent and its dependencies Having been reflected upon for

Every Man his own Broker a duodecimo volume the Elements of Commerce Politics and Finances a quarto volume and a Translation of Neckar on the Finances of France which was published under the patronage

designed for the Law With this  view he was entered at Lincoln's Inn but has never been called to the bar His maidenoffering to the stage was a comic Song in Mr Reynolds' comedy of Notoriety He has since that time written Columbus an historical play the Children in the Wood a farce Zorinski the Way to get Married and a Cure for the Heart Ache comedies The first of these pieces was published in It is a queer compound and was vehemently accused upon its first appearance by Mr Thelwall as a shameful plagiarism from an historical opera entitled "The Incas or the Peruvian Virgin" which he had offered without success to Mr Harris nine months previously Zorinski has also been accused as a plagiarism from Brooke's Gustavus Vasa Mr Morton's "Cure for the Heart Ache" is in our opinion the best of his dramatic pieces They have many of them experienced considerable favour from the public and have raised their author to the character of a very successful modern playwriter As to their  absolute  merit however we must observe that although they have been approved in an age in which dramatic composition is at a most melancholy ebb in which our plays wear no longer the stamp of real life neither does their colouring shew the breathing vivacity of original observation in which the strongest effort of dramatic satire is to make an actor who is endowed with particular talents laugh before his audience at a reigning eccentricity and  not as formerly personate the character to which it is peculiar and in which an eternal repitition of some contemptible vulgarity is to supply the places of wit and brilliancy yet their existence we must hope is eminently precarious for should a tolerable taste ever again favour a British audience posterity shall with difficulty credit that such plays were  heard  and with still greater difficulty that they were applauded  MOSELEY WALTER MICHAEL ESQ  The author of a very agreable "Essay on Archery" describing the practice of that art in all ages and nations which he published in an octavo volume in a time when archery was the whim of the day  MOSELEY BENJAMIN ESQ MD  Physician to Chelsea Hospital Member of the College of Physicians London and of several foreign Societies This gentleman practised some time as surgeon at Kingston in Jamaica He wrote in "Observations on the Dysentery of the West Indies" His next production was a Treatise concerning the Properties and Effects of Coffee which was first published in and  has seen five editions He has also written a Treatise on tropical Diseases and on the Climate of the West Indies published in an octavo volume in All his publications are highly respectable in point of merit  MOSER JOSEPH ESQ  A Justice of the Peace for the City of Westminster He published in "Turkish Tales" in two duodecimo volumes and has also written "Anecdotes of Richard Brothers" Lucifer and Mammon the Adventures of Timothy Twig in the manner of the Bath Guide the MealTub Plot or Remarks on

Essay on the Management Nursing and Diseases of Children from the Birth in an octavo volume which has lately reached  a second edition He also published in "A familiar medical Survey of Liverpool" in a duodecimo volume which did not add to his reputation as an author  MOUNTMORRES VISCOUNTSee Morres  MULSO THOMAS ESQ  Brother to Mrs Chapone and author of "Calistus or the Man of Fashion and Sophronius or the Country Gentleman" three most excellent dialogues published in an octavo volume in  MURPHY ARTHUR ESQ  Barrister at Law and a gentleman who has long been highly and justly esteemed as an elegant Scholar He was the intimate friend of Dr Samuel Johnson many years previous to his death and has done real service to the character and memory of that celebrated genius by becoming the editor of his works and his biographer He has also been honoured with the intimate friendship of Mr Garrick Sir Francis Blake Delaval and Mr Foote Mr Murphy was warmly engaged at the commencement of the present reign in the party of the  Earl of Bute and was upon that account exposed to the ridicule of Wilkes and Churchill Early in life he made an attempt upon the stage and is severely satirised in the Rosciad particularly for his illsuccess in the character of Othello As an author Mr Murphy made his first appearance in the Gray'sInn Journal a periodical paper begun in and which was continued for two years This paper contains many ingenious essays which are collected in two octavo volumes in the edition of his works and was the origin of Mr Murphy's acquaintance with Dr Johnson For being at a friend's house in the country and not disposed to lose pleasure for business he took up a French  Journal Literaire  and translating something he liked sent it to his bookseller Time discovered that he had translated from the French a Rambler which had been taken from the English without acknowledgement and his subsequent apology to Dr Johnson gave birth to a lasting friendship Mr Murphy's most numerous pieces however are in the dramatic line of composition He began with producing three farces in viz the Apprentice the Spouter and the Englishman from Paris The last of these pieces was only acted one night and has never reached the press He has since that time written for the stage the Upholsterer a farce the Orphan of China a tragedy translated from Voltaire the Desert Island a dramatic tale the Way to Keep Him and All in the Wrong comedies the Old  Maid and the Citizen farces No Man's Enemy but his Own and the School for Guardians comedies Zenobia the Grecian Daughter and Alzuma tragedies of which the first is translated from Crebillon News from Parnassus a prelude Know your Own Mind and the Choice comedies and Three Weeks after Marriage a farce These pieces were printed separately at the time of their first appearance and have since been collected in the edition of Mr Murphy's works in seven octavo volumes published in They have many of them considerable pretensions to merit The most distinguished are probably the Grecian Daughter and Three Weeks after Marriage which last had been most capriciously condemned under its first title viz "What we must All Come To" In the abovementioned edition of his works is also to be found the Rival Sisters a tragedy which Mr Murphy never offered to the stage and some smaller Poems a few of which had been published separately Some elegant Translations from the English into Latin verse which are given in this edition do the highest honour to Mr Murphy's talents among them the translation of Gray's Elegy is eminently beautiful The first specimen of his skill at biographical writing was a copious and most entertaining Essay on the Life and Genius of Henry Fielding prefixed to the edition of that author's works which was published in About five years afterward he published in a duodecimo volume  a most excellent Translation of Marmontel's Belisarius Neither of these productions are to be found in the sevenvolume edition of Mr Murphy's works His writings since the publication of that edition have been "Seventeen Hundred and Ninetyone" a poem in imitation of the thirteenth Satire of Juvenal of which Johnson after giving us his noble imitations of the third and tenth Satires said he wished  this  Satire also was done an Essay on the Life and Genius of Dr Johnson published in an octavo volume in and prefixed to Mr Murphy's edition of Dr Johnson's Works in twelve volumes octavo and a Translation of the Works of Tacitus published in in four quarto volumes  As the Biographer of Dr Johnson we feel little hesitation in giving Mr Murphy the first place among the many who have aspired to that character His short Essay is the production of a writer who has duly weighed and rightly conceived that judicious uniformity of colouring which while it gratifies the reader's curiosity never fails to hold in its just light the object which it represents and while we have been disgusted with the impertinent prattle which by some writers has been so freely expended upon this virtuous and wise though partial and austere character we find in this Essay a manliness and propriety of conduct which can always keep up in our minds an interest in his behalf without ever forfeiting the dignity of its  object His opinions upon the writings of his author are highly judicious and most honourable to his critical talents and his edition of Dr Johnson's Works clearly entitles him to the same place among the Editors of that great character which we have given him among his biographers As a Translator of Tacitus Mr Murphy will find most favour from those who are most acquainted with the peril of his situation The celebrated Mr Gray in one of his Letters declares that he found himself after making an attempt unequal to the task of giving Tacitus a becoming dress in our language A better judge than Mr Gray of such an undertaking will not easily be found We are sorry that we can say nothing in praise of Mr Murphy's laborious work The freedom of his translation appears to us the leading circumstance against his success But when we add that notwithstanding every licence of this kind the English work he has afforded us is far from an elegant composition can we say that he has kept any measures with justice in the execution of his task The merit however of his original writings will supersede every unfavourable impression of an unfortunate attempt and gain his writings a lasting distinction among the works of taste It is said that he has been for some time engaged in writing the Life of his friend Foote Few are so equal to the task of doing justice to the English Aristophanes  MURPHY JAMES  An Architect of most distinguished ingenuity who has published

of Mr O'Keefe's publications As a dramatic writer this gentleman has perhaps for some years crossed the meridian of his glory His plays are for the most part characterised by broad humour without purity of diction or wit of dialogue and by a neglect of plot probability and often commonsense He has perhaps contributed his share to the introduction of that vitiated taste in dramatic composition which at present so lamentably prevails He has contrived however to please many and he who pleases many must have merit  O'LEARY REV ARTHUR  A Roman Catholic Clergyman of the kingdom of Ireland He has

pamphlet entitled the Retrospect and has also published a few occasional single Sermons and two entertaining and wellwritten octavo volumes of Travels into different Parts of Europe As a writer Mr Owen is entitled to the credit of considerable  elegance and taste but he has likewise unfortunately an unseemly tinge of affectation  P  PADMAN J ESQ  A CLERK in the Bank and author of "A Layman's Protest against Paine's Age of Reason"  PAINE  The name he inherited from his family is Pain which he bore when he first appeared in America His reason for adding the  e  final always afterward is left to the penetration of the reader  THOMAS  This notorious character was born in at Thetford in Norfolk His father was a staymaker he was himself brought up to that profession and exercised it during his youth at London Dover and Sandwich He afterward turned Exciseman and Grocer at Lewes in Sussex and upon the occasion of an election at Shoreham in the poets of Lewes being called upon by the candidate of fairest pretensions to furnish an election  song Paine entered the lists obtained the laurel and was presented with three guineas This we believe was his first public appearance as an author in the year following a design having been formed by the excise officers throughout the kingdom to apply to Parliament for a consideration of the state of their salaries he wrote  their case  in an octavo pamphlet of twentyone pages which was republished in London a few years ago Having been discovered as a grocer to deal in exciseable articles and as a grinder of snuff to buy smuggled tobacco he was dismissed from the excise in after twelve years service In the mean time Paine by his  Case of the Excisemen  and by his plausibility of manner had attracted the notice of the late Mr George Lewis Scott commissioner of excise This gentleman recommended him strongly to the celebrated Dr Benjamin Franklin as a person who could be serviceable at that time in America and Paine set sail for Pennsylvania in September upon a letter of introduction to Governor Franklin of the Jerseys It was two years after this that he attracted great notice by the publication of his pamphlet entitled "Common Sense" Designed as this production was to ridicule and expose the absurdity of monarchical Government it proved highly palatable to the republican taste of the United States It has been called one of those few literary performances which have been known to produce a great and sudden effect upon the sentiments  and conduct of a nation and having been published at a very critical period the commencement of the American war served more than any thing else to induce the inhabitants of that country to an immediate declaration of independence At the latter end of the same year he began to publish in the Pennsylvania Journal "The Crisis" a periodical essay which appeared as often during the continuance of hostilities as his idea of the state of affairs required The congress at first managed their European concerns by a committee for secret correspondence but their demands for European aid becoming more urgent the Secret Committee was converted into a Committee for Foreign Affairs Paine who was now becoming a celebrated character in the United States was appointed Secretary to this Committee but being detected in retailing through the newspapers what he confidentially knew from the foreign correspondence he was forced to resign that office Soon after this he obtained the degree of M A from the University of Pennsylvania was chosen a Member of the American Philosophical Society and when the Congress had rejected him as unworthy of trust the Assembly of Pennsylvania which had been purged of Quakers by his pen thought him fit for its Clerk In he printed at Philadelphia a Letter to the Abbé Raynal on the Affairs of North America in which he undertook to correct and clear up the mistakes in the Abbé's Account of the Revolution A  little later in the same year and at the same place he also printed a Letter to the Earl of Shelburne on his Speech in Parliament July th in which the noble Earl had said that  When Great Britain shall acknowledge American Independence the sun of Britain's glory is set for ever  Both of these Letters were shortly afterward reprinted in London In the Autumn of Paine left America with the intention of going to France and arrived at Paris early in having left no great share of popularity behind him His stay here was short and he reached London in the Autumn of the same year Before the conclusion of he published a pamphlet upon the recent transactions between Great Britain and Holland entitled "Prospects on the Rubicon" in which he censured the measures of the English Administration  We come now to that period in Paine's History when his speculations were to shake the fabric of the public mind to its very foundation and his writings to infuse a poison among a deluded commonalty the effects of which to a philosopher in the shade would have been scarcely credible Being released in November from a sponginghouse into which a debt contracted by the project of erecting an Iron Bridge had brought him he beheld with delight the proceedings of that memorable year in France and hastened to that country Soon however he recrossed the channel  and in his road to London encountered Mr Burke's farfamed pamphlet which appeared a few days before the celebration of the French Revolution November th A few months labour produced Part I of the "Rights of Man" It was submitted to the revisal of Mr Brand Hollis and a democratic Committee and after some struggles between the desires of the author and the wishes of his patrons was committed by them to the press In February it was printed for Johnson in St Paul's Church Yard but his regard for  the credit of his shop  induced him to decline the sale and a delay of a month in the publication thus took place A few copies were however smuggled into private hands and at length on the th of March it was published by Jordan in Fleet Street with a Dedication to General Washington The apprehensions of Paine upon this occasion seem to have been very great Always ready to take wing for France he fluttered with anxiety about the Metropolis At length finding that the Ministry trusting to the good sense of the people gave itself no concern about him he took a lodging in Fetter Lane where he remained till his final departure and immediately went to work at Part II of the "Rights of Man" This was published by Jordan early in It is well known that the Jacobin Societies took the utmost pains to distribute cheap editions of this work over the whole nation particularly in manufactories  and among the labouring poor It is even said that tobacco grocery and sweetmeats for children were frequently sold in wrappers of its sheets Many Answers to the two Parts were produced at the press and at the anniversary meeting of the Constitutional Society on the th of April the Members of these Jacobin Societies were stated to exceed forty thousand persons Government at length became alarmed Prosecutions were commemced in May against Paine as the author and Jordan as the publisher of "Rights of Man" The royal proclamation was issued stating that seditious writings had been industriously dispersed for inciting discontent and warning all magistrates to be diligent in suppressing tumult and preserving quiet Both Houses of Parliament declared their abhorrence of writings which had anarchy for their end and proclaimed their unalterable resolution to maintain the authority of the laws The City of London avowed her loyalty to the King and her attachment to the constitution The other corporations followed the example of the metropolis and the countymeetings joined in the general abhorrence of innovation and in the universal determination to support the wise system of policy which had been transmitted by the wisdom of their ancestors Paine was now employed in writing those Letters for the ARGUS which were afterward distributed from the pamphletshops under the title of "Paine's four Letters  on Government" Shortly afterward he produced a pamphlet consisting of two Letters to Lord Onslow and one to Mr Dundas and another pamphlet containing "A Letter to the Addressers on the late Proclamation" the great object of which was to procure a National Convention in contempt of the Parliament He was at the same time readily adopted as a proper citizen by a country which had recently plunged into the depths of anarchy and when the Jacobin Clubs were about to form a Convention at Paris of turbulent spirits from every quarter of the world several departments contended for the honour of being represented by the celebrated Thomas Paine Calais bore away the  glorious  prize from all her competitors and she sent citizen Audibert to signify his appointment and to solicit his acceptance of it He required little solicitation and quitting London on the th of September was received with open arms on the following day on the shores of Calais He was tried by a special jury at Guildhall and convicted as a malignant libeller and soon afterward his effigy and his books were burned in almost every village in England His conviction made him an outlaw and having joined the Convention at Paris in a declaration of war against Great Britain he has since that time become a traitor Amid the changes of Government in France Paine did not escape notice and when Robespierre began to gain an ascendancy he was  sent with Anacharsis Cloots to the prison at Luxemburg He however escaped the Guillotine and during his confinement composed his work entitled "The Age of Reason" Part I of which was published in London in and Part II in the year following This work naturally produced several Answers at the press among which the "Apology for the Bible" by the Bishop of Landaff is to be most eminently distinguished Paine's subsequent writings have been a Dissertation on the first Principles of Government "The Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance" a most impudent Letter to General Washington and "Agrarian Justice opposed to Agrarian Law and to Agrarian Monopoly" all pamphlets  The abuse which has been so liberally bestowed upon Paine as a writer has perhaps for the most part been the result of a zeal whose tendency is to weaken more than to support its cause Let us rather allow him the qualified credit of an animated energetic writer who displays considerable acuteness but whose manner of thinking is rude wicked and daring and whose language is vulgar though impressive Let us rather rejoice that Englishmen with their just veneration for civil liberty and the rights of the people were found so wise and stedfast in an hour of danger as to despise those sorry calculators that would persuade a country whose constitution has raised her to be the envy of all the civilized world to hazard that constitution upon  the grossest clumsiest and stalest theories Let us be thankful that the Archtheorist of the Rights of Man of those rights which transfer the reins from his passion to his reason of those rights which dissolve ties which confound distinctions which destroy security could play upon us with his new lights upon human governments without dazzling our reason or impairing our eyesight Finally let us rejoice that when this wily and audacious Anarch dared at last to attack the sacred volume of our Religion there was found on our bench of Bishops a learned and philosophical Prelate condescending enough and active enough to oppose them nobly and completely by his erudition his clearness and his strength of argument  PALEY REV WILLIAM DD  Archdeacon of Carlisle c A most venerable and distinguished character as a sound Reasoner a wellread Scholar and an excellent Divine He was educated at Christ's College Cambridge took his degree of Batchelor of Arts with great distinction in and afterward became tutor of the above society His works have experienced that brilliant success to which their very extraordinary value entitles them The first of them excepting single Sermons was his highly celebrated "Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy" which  was first published in a quarto volume in and has since been very frequently reprinted with corrections and improvements in two octavo volumes It is hardly possible to say too much in favour of this treatise The ripest schoolman may read it with instruction and delight while it contains amusement for the most volatile fancy It has obtained its author one distinction among others singularly glorious and most probably unparallelled We mean the circumstance of its chapters being very frequently subjects for disputation in the Schools of one of our Universities at the same time with sections of the immortal Principia of Newton or with chapters of the celebrated Essay of Locke Thus the distinguished honours which such transcendent characters are proud to receive after death are conferred on Dr Paley while alive The style of this work is admirably adapted to its subject and is perhaps one of the best models for the imitation of youth which can be found in our language while the fine reasoning the pertinency of illustration the strong integrity of judgement and the great comprehension of mind which pervade it may be fit objects of its emulation provided it duly estimate the labour of thought and application necessary to such acquisitions and form not after all too sanguine hopes of reaching such perfection Some Remarks upon this work have been written by Mr Gisborne for an account of which we refer the reader to our memoir of  that gentleman Beside this production Dr Paley has published several single Sermons preached on particular occasions and before the University of Cambridge "Horae Paulinae or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul evinced by a Comparison of the Epistles which bear his Name with the Acts of the Apostles and with one another" published in an octavo volume in and "A View of the Evidences of Christianity" in three volumes octavo published in All these productions are worthy of the celebrated author of "Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy" The last of them in particular has experienced a most distinguished reception It bears in every page the strongest characteristic touches of its able and excellent writer It is the most complete summary of the evidences of Christianity that has ever appeared It is a work most essential and useful to his fellowcreatures and must be acceptable in the sight of his God  PALMER REV THOMAS FYSHE  An Unitarian Minister formerly Pastor of a congregation at Dundee and Fellow of Queen's College

and appeared in a Greek and English Lexicon to the New Testament a very valuable work published in a quarto volume in and "The Divinity and PreExistence of our Saviour demonstrated from Scripture" an answer to Priestley and Wakefield published in an octavo pamphlet in  PARKINSON REV T DD FRS  Late Fellow and Tutor of Christ's College Cambridge This gentleman was a cotemporary at the University with the celebrated mathematician Mr Atwood They both took their degrees of B A in and to Mr Parkinson was adjudged the superiority in mathematical knowledge The world however from the specimens which each of these gentlemen have given it as writers on subjects of science will be disposed to wonder at this decision Dr Parkinson published in in a quarto volume a System of Mechanics and Hydrostatics the substance of his lectures as a public tutor Of this work we do not scruple to declare that it is one of the clumsiest which has ever come from the hands of an able proficient in natural philosophy who has attempted to facilitate the progress of the Student by a selection from the works of others▪ It is a disgraceful specimen of  the proficiency of an University who prides herself on polishing the abstruseness of science and uniting in her studies an elegance with a profundity of research It is of a character so coarse and rugged and of a bulk so unnecessarily huge as to frighten rather than encourage the student Finally it is the work of a writer whose elegance of thought whose justness of conception whose perspicuity of arrangement and whose beauty of operation can in no wise be compared with the masterly specimens of the union of all these excellencies which have been afforded us by Mr Atwood Beside this work Dr Parkinson has published two single Sermons  PARR REV SAMUEL LLD  A most elegant and profound Scholar very highly celebrated for his knowledge of the Greek language He was originally one of the undermasters of Harrow School and in that situation had the honour of sharing in the education among others of Mr Richard Brinsley Sheridan Upon a vacancy in the headmastership in Dr Parr became a candidate for that office and his cause was so warmly espoused by many of the boys of the school as to occasion very turbulent proceedings Proving unsuccessful he retired to a village at a small distance from Harrow and opened a  school to which he was followed by many of the Harrow scholars Dr Parr was afterward appointed by the Earl of Dartmouth to superintend the education of his eldest son Lord Viscount Lewisham in consequence of which he resigned his school and fixed his residence at Colchester where he was attended by his Lordship and one or two more pupils At the expiration of this engagement he was chosen Master of the Free School at Norwich which he conducted with great reputation and has now been settled for some years in the neighbourhood of Warwick in the occupation of educating private pupils  Dr Parr's first publications were Sermons preached at Norwich during the American war Of these two appeared with his name in and a third a Fast Sermon under the name  Phileleutherus Norfolciensis  in the year following The last of these is particularly excellent In he published a fourth Sermon preached for the benefit of the Charity Schools in Norwich It was in the year following this that he published a new edition in an octavo volume of the three Books  De Statu  of Bellendenus Master of the Pleas to James I and prefixed a most elegant Preface Few pieces of composition in Latin have been more admired than this masterly preface It was reprinted separately in the year following its first publication It consists chiefly of a political retrospect of the internal transactions of Britain since the year and  presents us an animated panegyric of Lord North Mr Burke and Mr Fox with a glowing invective against the methods employed to deprive them of the share they held in the Government of their country The Latin as well as the English style of Dr Parr is always strong manly and beautiful but perhaps it possesses upon the whole less of grace and elegance than of energy In Dr Parr published "Tracts by Warburton and a Warburtonian not admitted into the Collection of their respective Works" in an octavo volume Almost every reader will condemn the poignancy of language which is used in the preface to this volume against the venerable Bishop of Worcester while he will confess with pleasure that the characters of Jortin Leland and Warburton are amply and beautifully delineated In the year Dr Parr published an octavo pamphlet entitled "A Sequel to the printed Paper  lately  circulated in Warwickshire by the Rev Charles Curtis brother of Alderman Curtis a Birmingham Rector c" which reached a second edition This was occasioned by a suspicion that Mr Curtis had written certain anonymous Letters which were sent to the Doctor that he had uttered certain reflections upon him in his pulpit discourses and that he had sent the  printed paper  which appeared  auctior et emendatior  in an evening Newspaper The same year produced Dr Parr's celebrated and excellent Letter from Irenopolis to the Inhabitants of Eleutheropolis  which is a serious address to the dissenters of Birmingham written in consequence of a report that they intended a second commemoration of the French Revolution and was published in a shilling pamphlet For an account of Dr Parr's literary association with the late Mr Homer and Dr Combe relative to the publication of an Edition of Horace we refer the reader to our memoir of the lastmentioned gentleman where he will also see the occasion which produced Dr Parr's excellent pamphlet entitled "Remarks on the Statement of Dr Charles Combe by  an occasional Writer in the British Critic"  It may very reasonably be questioned whether the services which Dr Parr has done to the world have been adequate to his ability or his knowledge Much is to be allowed however for that want of leisure and opportunity which every man of letters must feel whole constant and necessary occupation is the instruction of youth To the character of a profound scholar though the printed testimonies he has afforded us may have been slender none shall dare to dispute his claim and were our remaining possessions of Greek and Latin authors to share the fate of the celebrated Alexandrian Library we believe that this gigantic proficient could afford us from recollection a very tolerable idea of Grecian and Roman literature Of the English style of Dr Parr it has been said that it unites the strength of Johnson with the richness of Burke  PARSONS WILLIAM ESQ  This gentleman was one of the gleaners of laurels on the banks of the Arno who some years ago published in association the Florence Miscellany vide Merry or Piozzi He has also written an Ode to a Boy at Eton Mr Greathead jun intended to counteract the gloomy conclusions of Mr Gray's wellknown Ode on that subject which with three Sonnets and one Epigram was published in a quarto pamphlet in Mr Parsons was also we believe a contributor to the "Poetry of the World" He has received a severe and we confess not an undeserved chastisement from Mr Gifford the author of the Baviad and the Maeviad and by way of retort courteous has shot many pins and needles from the newspapers at the javelinproof armour of that hero  PARSONS REV PHILIP A M  Minister of Wye in Kent He published in in a quarto volume "Monuments and Painted Glass of upward of one hundred Churches chiefly in the Eastern Part of Kent" and in the year following an admirable Discourse preached at the funeral of the late Alderman Sawbridge  Mr Parsons previously to these publications had written Dialogues between the Dead and the Living and six Letters to a Friend on the Establishment of Sunday Schools  PARSONS REV JOHN WEDDELL  Vicar of Wellington in the county of Hereford and author of Essays on Education published in a duodecimo volume in which had appeared separately some years ago  PARSONS MRS  A widow who was reduced from a state of affluence to the hard necessity of writing to provide for a numerous family She published in "The History of Miss Meredith" in two duodecimo volumes and has also written "The Errors of Innocence" "Ellen and Julia" "Lucy" "The Voluntary Exile" and "The Girl of the Mountains" novels all of which are very respectable performances and the Intrigues of a Morning a farce  PASQUIN ANTHONYSee John Williams  PATERSON DANIEL  A Captain in the Army and Assistant to the Quartermastergeneral of his Majesty's Forces He is author of a wellknown Book of Roads in an octavo volume which made its first appearance in has since seen many editions and has experienced that encouragement to which such a laborious work was entitled He has also published a Travelling Dictionary in an octavo volume and the British Itinerary in two duodecimo volumes  PAYNE JOHN  This writer has assumed the names  George Augustus Hervey William Frederic Melmoth  c Under the first of these he published some years ago a Naval Commercial and General History of Great Britain in five octavo volumes He has also written a System of Geography an Epitome of History in two octavo volumes of which the first appeared in and Geographical Extracts in an octavo volume published in The two last of these works appeared in his own name and they all entitle him to the character of an industrious and ingenious compiler  PEACOCK REV DANIEL MITFORD MA  Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge and a gentleman of very superior abilities and attainments He published in a most excellent pamphlet entitled "Considerations on the Structure of the House of Commons c" with which the Bishop of London was so much pleased that he appointed him a Whitehall Preacher upon the first subsequent opportunity Mr Peacock was engaged not long ago in a kind of controversy with the Critical Reviewers which was occasioned by some severe strictures passed by them upon a System of Algebra published by his friend Mr Wood of St John's College Cambridge  PEACOCK MISS  A Novelwriter of some merit She published in being then very young an allegory entitled "The Adventures of the six Princesses of Babylon in their Travels to the Temple of Virtue" Since that time she has written "The Knight of the Rose" an allegorical narrative the Juvenile Magazine "The Visit for a Week" designed for youth and " Ambrose and Eleanor"  translated from the French All of her publications have been anonymous  PEAKE THOMAS ESQ  Of Lincoln's Inn This gentleman published in in a royal octavo volume Cases determined at Nisi Prius in the Court of King's Bench from the sittings after Easter Term Geo III to the sittings after Michaelmas Term Geo III both inclusive These Cases are so extremely well reported that they may be considered as models  PEARCE  A Dramatic Writer who has experienced tolerable success His most distinguished piece is Hartford Bridge an operatic farce which was very well received and published in In the same year he published the Midnight Wanderers a comic opera in two acts and has since published Netley Abbey an operatic farce Arrived at Portsmouth an operatic drama in two acts occasioned by Lord Howe's Victory and Windsor Castle an opera in honour of the Prince of Wales' Marriage The poetical talents of Mr Pearce are by no means contemptible  PEARSON GEORGE ESQ MD  Member of the Royal College of Physicians London This gentleman published in two octavo volumes of Observations and Experiments for investigating the Chemical History of the tepid Springs of Buxton c The occasion of this publication was the discovery of an error in the common opinion concerning the nature of a kind of  air  or  permanent vapour  that impregnates the tepid waters of Buxton on which their peculiar efficacy in diseases was believed principally to depend In the year following Dr Pearson published Directions for impregnating the Buxton Water with its own and other Gases in an octavo pamphlet and in a Translation of the Table of Chemical Nomenclature proposed by De Guyton formerly de Morveau Lavoisier Bertholet and De Fourcroy in a quarto volume Dr Pearson is well known as a judicious and useful writer  PEARSON JOHN ESQ  Surgeon to the Lock Hospital He published in Part I of Principles of Surgery for the Use of chirurgical Students in an octavo volume which was primarily designed as a textbook for  the attendants of his surgical lectures and in an octavo pamphlet of Practical Observations on Cancerous Complaints  PEARSON REV EDWARD BD  Fellow and Tutor of Sidney Sussex College Cambridge This gentleman gained the Norrisian Prize in the University in the year for an Essay on the Goodness of God as manifested in the Mission of Jesus Christ which was published in pursuance of the will of the founder He has also published several excellent single Sermons most of which were delivered before the University  PEARSON MRS S  This lady published by subscription in "Poems" in a quarto pamphlet which possess some merit She has since that time written the Medallion a novel in three duodecimo volumes  PEART E ESQ MD  This gentleman published in "The Generation of Animal Heat investigated" an octavo pamphlet and has since that time written an  octavo volume on the Elementary Principles of Nature a pamphlet on Electricity a pamphlet on the Properties of Matter the Principles of Chemistry c a pamphlet on Electric Atmospheres an octavo volume entitled "The Antiphlogistic Doctrine of M Lavoisier critically examined and demonstratively confuted" and an octavo volume on the Composition and Properties of Water Dr Peart was some time ago engaged in a controversy with Mr Read of Knightsbridge on the subject of Electricity In all of his writings he has adhered to a philosophy of his own contriving and modifying with much ingenuity three simple elementary substances one solid and two fluid so as to account for all possible phenomena Most readers however will perhaps be disposed to allow him more credit for the ingenuity than for the solidity of his principles  PECKARD REV PETER DD  Dean of Peterborough and Master of Magdalen College Cambridge This venerable divine has uniformly shewn himself a zealous advocate for toleration and liberty He published in the year a Sermon preached at Huntingdon in favour of the Bill for Naturalizing the Jews and also a Sermon on Civil and Religious Liberty Some time after this he had a controversy with  Mr Caleb Fleming on the Materiality of the Soul and wrote in Observations on his  Survey of the Search after Souls  Dr Peckard has since that time published several occasional single Sermons in some of which he has been loud in his censures upon the Slavetrade a Dissertation on Revelations xi and Memoirs of the Life of Mr Nicholas Ferrar his relation by marriage and a celebrated ascetic of the last century in an octavo volume published in  PENN JOHN ESQ  This gentleman is grandson of the celebrated Cecrops of Pennsylvania He published in the Battle of Eddington a tragedy the argument of which is taken from the History of Alfred It was acted privately for a night or two at the Haymarket and to the second edition of it were added Letters on the Drama The Monthly Reviewers having criticised this tragedy with freedom Mr Penn published a Reply to their Strictures which we think he would have done more wisely to have let alone He has also written a Translation of Signior Ranieri Calsabigi's Letter to Count Alfieri on Tragedy with notes and an octavo volume of Poetical Translations and Miscellanies containing many Odes and Sonnets from Petrarch  PENNANT THOMAS ESQ FRS  Member of many foreign Societies and a most ingenious and celebrated Naturalist and Antiquarian He was born at Downing in Flintshire in received the earlier part of his education at Wrexham School was afterward removed to a school at Fulham then kept by Mr Croft and after being a Member of Queen's and Oriel Colleges Oxford assumed the law gown A present or Willoughby's Ornithology made to him at the age of twelve years first gave him a taste for the study of Natural History Of Mr Pennant's first work his celebrated British Zoology the first part made its appearance on the st of March in Imperial folio It was carried on at the expence of a Society of ancient Britons the Cymmrodorions for the benefit of a Welch charityschool in London and was completed in This work was next published in four volumes octavo of which the two first made their appearance in and it has since been also reprinted in quarto Mr Pennant's subsequent publications have been Indian Zoology formed from a fine collection of drawings of animals brought over by J G Loten Esq a former Governor in Ceylon of which a small part was first published in folio in and which a few years ago was published with  additions by other hands in a quarto volume a Synopsis of Quadrupeds published in an octavo volume in a Tour in Scotland made in published in an octavo volume in and afterward republished with large additions in quarto Genera of Birds a duodecimo volume published in a Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides made in published in a quarto volume in Part II of this Tour published in a quarto volume in a Tour in Wales published in a quarto volume in a Journey to Snowdon in continuation of the last mentioned Tour published in a quarto volume in History of Quadrupeds in two volumes quarto published in Free Thoughts on our Militia Laws a sixpenny pamphlet addressed in to the poor inhabitants of North Wales a Journey from Chester to London published in a quarto volume in Part II Vol II of a Tour in Wales in continuation of the Journey to Snowdon published in quarto in a Letter from a Welch Freeholder published in Arctic Zoology in two volumes quarto published in Indexes to the Ornithology of the Comte de Buffon and the  Planches enluminées  published in a quarto volume in Supplement to the Arctic Zoology a quarto volume published in and some Account of London published in a quarto volume in Beside these productions Mr Pennant had at this time written the  Natural History of the Turkey and an Account of Earthquakes felt in Flintshire in the Philosophical Transactions of the year as also "Miscellanies" of which only thirty copies were printed at the press of George Allan Esq of Darlington  In the year Mr Pennant determined to desist from his literary labours and Signified his intention in a prefatory paragraph to his Account of London Two years afterward however he published a Letter to a Member of Parliament on Mail Coaches and has also written "The Literary Life of  the late  Thomas Pennant Esq" published in a thin quarto volume in and a History of the Parishes of Whiteford and Holywell published in a quarto volume in This literary death to which Mr Pennant condemned himself and his subsequent resuscitation had a very whimsical appearance But those who were most in habits of intimacy with him while he  lived  and knew best the pleasure and instruction he could afford them would most rejoice that his sleep was not eternal  PERCIVAL THOMAS ESQ MD FRAS  Member of the Medical Societies of London and Edinburgh c A Physician of Manchester whose judgement and industry have materially benefitted medicine and philosophy His first publication  was an octavo volume of Essays Medical and Experimental which appeared in Soon after this he published several small tracts singly viz the Disadvantages of early Inoculation Experiments and Observations on Water and Observations and Experiments on the Poison of Lead In the year he published an octavo volume of Philosophical Medical and Experimental Essays which together with the above mentioned volume and tracts and some detached pieces inserted in Transactions of learned societies or in periodical journals has ever since been reprinted in two octavo volumes under the title "Essays Medical Philosophical and Experimental"  Dr Percival is also distinguished as a pleasing and instructive writer for juvenile readers He published in "A Father's Instructions to his Children" in a duodecimo volume consisting of tales fables and reflections designed to promote the love of virtue a taste for knowledge and an early acquaintance with the works of nature Two years afterward he added another volume and completed a work which is executed in a manner most excellently adapted to its object Since that time Dr Percival has written "Moral and Literary Dissertations" published in an octavo volume in and several Papers in the Transactions of the Philosophical and Literary Society of Manchester  PERCY REV THOMAS DD  Lord Bishop of Dromore in the kingdom of Ireland His Lordiship published in HAU KIOU CHOAAN or the pleasing History a Chinese Romance in four duodecimo volumes This literary curiosity is a translation from the Chinese language which his Lordship had revised from a manuscript dated found among the papers of a gentleman who had large concerns in the East India Company and who occasionally resided much at Canton In his Lordship presented the public with a very elegant and curious Collection of Reliques of ancient English Poetry published by Dodsley in three duodecimo volumes and six years afterward he published the Hermit of Warkworth a Northumberland ballad In the class of divinity we believe his Lordship has only printed a single Sermon For the curious anecdotes and literary information to be found in the Edition of the Tatler with Illustrations and Notes historical biographical and critical published in six octavo volumes in the year the public is principally indebted to this prelate though it was finished and edited by another hand  PERFECT WILLIAM ESQ MD  A Surgeon of West Malling in Kent Member of the London Medical Society and Provincial Grand Master of Masons for the county of Kent This gentleman was born at Oxford in and is son of the Rev William Perfect formerly Vicar of East Mailing in Kent He is celebrated for his skill in the cure of persons afflicted with insanity and for his activity as a member of the brotherhood of Free and Accepted Masons Dr Perfect communicated several articles to the Medical Museum among them are "An Attempt to improve Medical Prognostication" "The Case of a Catalepsy" and "The Appearances on dissecting a Woman who died of eating too much Cucumber" In he published "Methods of Cure in some particular Cases of Insanity" an octavo pamphlet and in Vol I in octavo of "Cases in Midwifery" to which Vol II was soon afterward added The last mentioned work was founded on the literary correspondence of the late learned and ingenious Dr Colin Mackenzie and contains the only traits of his practice which have hitherto been submitted to the public eye In Dr Perfect published an Address to the Public on the Subject of Insanity notifying that he had opened houses at West Malling for the reception of insane persons  and three years afterward he produced an octavo volume of select Cases in the different Species of Insanity Lunacy or Madness with the Modes of Practice as adopted in the Treatment of each Since that time Dr Perfect's only production in this class of publications has been a pamphlet entitled "A remarkable Case of Madness with the Diet and Medicines used in the Cure" This remarkable case is a boy at the age of  eleven  and the cure is an additional proof of the author's skill in the treatment of confirmed mania  Dr Perfect is also a Versifier as well as a writer on medical subjects He published so early as the year "A Bavin of Bays" in a duodecimo volume and has also written "The Laurel Wreath" in two duodecimo volumes an Elegy on the great Storm in which was a good deal read the Snowy Day a pastoral sketch and "Poetical Effusions" published in His verses cannot be said to tower very highly above mediocrity  PERRY JAMES  A native of Scotland and the editor of the newspaper called the Morning Chronicle  PERRY SAMPSON  Formerly a Surgeon He has written an Historical Sketch of the French Revolution in two octavo volumes published in and the Argus or General Observer a political miscellany in an octavo volume published the same year Both party publications  PHILLIPS JOHN  The author of an entertaining and instructive General History of Inland Navigation foreign and domestic which he published in a quarto volume in and to which he has since added two uniform pamphlets of  Addenda  PHILLIPS THOMAS  A native of Shrewsbury Author of the History and Antiquities of Shrewsbury in one volume quarto and of a few pamphlets on Theological Subjects By the interest of Sir William Pulteney he obtained a place in the Customs which he now holds  PICKBOURN JAMES  Master of a Boardingschool at Hackney and author of a Dissertation on the English Verb published in an octavo volume in which evinces considerable grammatical knowledge and judgement  PILKINGTON JAMES  The author of a useful View of the State of Derbyshire in two octavo volumes published in to which the Society for the Encouragement of Arts Manufactures and Commerce adjudged the reward of twentyfive guineas Mr Pilkington also published in a pamphlet entitled "The Doctrine of Equality of Rank and Condition examined and supported on the Authority of the New Testament and on the Principles of Reason and Benevolence" in which he is as ingenious as a theoretical visionary can be said to be  PILKINGTON MRS J  This lady in sought the press with two little volumes of "Miscellaneous Poems" We will only add she had done better to have staid at home  PINDAR PETERSee Walcot  PINKERTON JOHN FSA PERTH  A native of Scotland His first publication was an octavo volume in which he entitled  Rimes  Being of opinion that uniformity of stanza when protracted to any degree must ever fatigue as extinguishing the great source of all pleasure variety he here adopted a series of stanzas in which as in the Greek strophe antistrophe and epode the two first correspond and are succeeded by a third of a different measure But the specimen with which Mr Pinkerton here presented the public was by no means peculiarly engaging In the year following he published "Tales in Verse" in a quarto pamphlet and also two dithyrambic Odes which are more distinguished by harshness and affected singularity than by any species of excellence Mr Pinkerton's next publication was a useful Essay on Medals which first appeared ano+nymously in a single octavo volume in and was enlarged to two volumes in the second edition The valuable assistance of Dr Combe and Mr Southgate we believe were afforded the author upon this occasion In Mr Pinkerton published "Ancient Scotish Poems never before in  Print" in two crownoctavo volumes and in the year following a Dissertation on the Origin and Progress of the Scythians or Goths in an octavo volume His subsequent publications have been an Enquiry into the History of Scotland preceeding the Reign of Malcolm III in two octavo volumes published in the first genuine edition of Barbour's Bruce with notes and a glossary in three volumes duodecimo published in Scotish Poems reprinted from scarce editions in three octavo volumes published in  Iconographia Scotica  or Portraits of illustrious Persons of Scotland with short Biographical Notices Part I II III IV and the History of Scotland from the Accession of the House of Stuart to that of Mary with Appendixes of original Papers in two volumes quarto published in In the last of these works Mr Pinkerton has judiciously chosen the period of Scotish History which remained insulated between the accurate investigation of the earlier age by Sir David Dalrymple and the elegant History of the later times by Dr Robertson He has produced a work of great merit and should it experience the favourable reception to which we think it entitled it is his design to write upon the same plan the History of Scotland from the earliest Accounts to the Accession of the House of Stuart Upon the whole our opinion of Mr Pinkerton as a writer is that notwithstanding an occasional unpleasant appearance of vanity pedantry  causticity and want of taste he is possessed of real and extensive knowledge much good sense and sufficient originality We think he is somewhat amenable on the score of Bookmaking  PIOZZI HESTHER LYNCH  A Lady of considerable notoriety in the literary world She is the daughter of John Salisbury Esq formerly of Bachygraig in the county of Flint and neice to Sir Thomas Salisbury who rose to considerable eminence as a civilian in Doctor's Commons In she married the late Henry Thrale Esq a distinguished Brewer in the borough of Southwark This excellent man in the year following his marriage was introduced by Mr Murphy to the acquaintance of Dr Samuel Johnson The intimacy of that celebrated character with this family daily increased and he soon became an almost constant inmate of their country residence at Streatham The conduct of Mr Thrale to Dr Johnson was indeed truly praiseworthy His family contributed for fifteen years to the prolongation and comfort of a most valuable life and when the benevolent master sunk into the grave the memory of his kindness was acknowledged by the loving object of his regard with the confession that with him were buried many of his hopes and pleasures that the face upon which he had looked for the last  time had never been turned upon him but with respect and benignity that he obtained from him many opportunities of amusement and turned his thoughts to him as to a refuge from misfortunes Upon the death of Mr Thrale his widow finding it as she asserts extremely perplexing and difficult to live in the same house with the Doctor took advantage of a lost lawsuit to plead inability of purse for remaining longer in London or its vicinity and retired to Bath where she knew he would not follow her She continued however to correspond with Dr Johnson till near the time July of her marriage to her second husband Signior Piozzi a native of Florence and a musicmaster of the City of Bath when a very warm expostulation on the part of the Doctor against this step dissolved their friendship Soon after her union with Mr Piozzi she travelled with him to the place of his birth and visited several parts of Europe before they returned to England  During her residence in Florence in chance having brought together at that place a few English of both sexes particularly Mr Merry Mr Parsons and Mr Greathead they wrote in association "The Florence Miscellany" a collection of pieces in prose and verse of which a few copies have been printed but it has not been published Some specimens of this flighty production appeared in a newspaper of the day called the World as well as in several of the magazines the preface  was written by Mrs Piozzi to whom we believe the conduct of the work had been committed Several other fugitive poetical pieces by Mrs Piozzi as the Three Warnings a tale imitated from La Fontaine a Translation of Boileau's Epistle to his Gardener first printed in Mrs Williams' Miscellanies and a Prologue to the Royal Suppliants have reached the public eye Among these the first is to be particularly distinguished as a very masterly production and it has been strongly suspected that Dr Johnson either wrote it or assisted in the composition of it The former opinion we think from the style of the piece is improbable but that it has felt his correcting hand we have little doubt  The first regular exploit of Mrs Piozzi in authorship was made in the year when she produced her crownoctavo volume of Anecdotes of Dr Johnson Two years after this she published a Collection of Letters to and from Dr Johnson from to in two octavo volumes Her "Anecdotes" as coming from the pen of a writer who had long shared the society and friendship of that illustrious character were perused with great avidity but time has dissolved the charm They bring us acquainted it is true with the domestic transactions and introduce us to the private hours of the object held up to our view yet what of this when as admirers of the learning and moral excellence of their hero we glow at  almost every page with indignation that his weaknesses and his failings should be disclosed to public view There is surely something sacred attached in every wellconstituted mind to the memory of a character which beside extorting from us a tribute of admiration by its public name has mingled its social intercourse with our private lives has confirmed and instructed us by its example and its precepts and displayed to us upon a nearer view a proportional degree of that excellence which same had conceded as its due To a mind of this make the stamp of death would enliven the impressions it had received and creating a melancholy and awful veneration for the departed object of its regard forget its failings amid its pious fondness for the pleasing remembrance of its worth The name of Johnson shall live while Piety while Virtue while Learning are regarded yet Johnson after the lustre he had reflected on the name of Thrale after the delight which his counsel and his friendship had for many years afforded to the family aged and infirm was to be deserted by his only surviving companion and his nurse a year or two before his end and after death to have his memory tortured and abused by her detested itch for scribbling More injury we will venture to affirm has been done to the same of Johnson by this lady and her late biographical helpmate  Boswell  than his most avowed  enemies have ever been able to effect and if his character becomes unpopular with some of his successors it is to these gossiping friends he is indebted for the favour  In Mrs Piozzi published "Observations and Reflections made in the Course of a Journey through France Italy and Germany" in two octavo volumes and in "British Synonymy or an Attempt at regulating the Choice of Words in familiar Conversation" in two octavo volumes The former of these works is entertaining though in many respect very reprehensible To the due execution of the latter a rare combination of talents was requisite among the least of which may be numbered neatness of style acuteness of perception and a more than common accuracy of discrimination This lady on the contrary brought to the task a jargon long since become proverbial for its vulgarity an incapability of defining a single term in the language and just so much Latin from a child's syntax as sufficed to expose the ignorance she so anxiously labours to conceal  Vide Preface to Baviad  The general character which we are disposed to afford Mrs Piozzi as an author is that she is possessed of respectable talents and of an education superior to what commonly falls to the lot of the fair sex but that her vanity is so conspicuous upon every occasion as to destroy in most  minds any favourable impression which her abilities or her attainments might make Little indeed do the lessons and example of her austere preceptor appear to have contributed toward making her more solid or more judicious  PLANTA JOSEPH ESQ  Secretary to the Royal Society and one of the underlibrarians to the British Museum He has written an Essay on the Runic or Scandinavian Language  PLAYFAIR REV JAMES DD  A native of Scotland and author of a valuable System of Chronology in a folio volume published in At the time of this publication Dr Playfair promised the public some chronological Dissertations if his work experienced a favourable reception they have not yet made their appearance  PLAYFAIR WILLIAM  A native of Scotland and an ingenious writer on Subjects of Calculation and Finance His first publication was a quarto pamphlet entitled "Regulations  for the interest of Money" and in he published in quarto the Commercial and Political Atlas representing by means of stained copperplate charts the exports imports and general trade of England the national debt and other public accounts Since that time he has written▪ an Essay on the National Debt "Inevitable Consequences of a Reform in Parliament" a General View of the actual Force and Resources of France in January "Better Prospects to the Merchants and Manufacturers of Great Britain" Thoughts on the Present State of French Politics "Peace with the Jacobins impossible" a Letter to Earl Fitzwilliam occasioned by his two Letters to the Earl of Carlisle and a Real Statement of the Finances and Resources of Great Britain  PLEYDELL J C ESQ  Late Lieutenant Colonel and Equerry to his Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester He published in an Essay on Field Fortification in an octavo volume and in Military Observations in a Tour through Part of France French Flanders and Luxembourgh in a quarto pamphlet A future publication of a similar kind with the latter of these is to depend upon the reception afforded to this  PLOWDEN FRANCIS ESQ LCD  Of the Middle Temple Barrister at Law and a Roman Catholic This gentleman's first publication was a discussion respecting the state of the descendants of persons attainted and aliens under the British Laws which he published in an octavo volume in under the title "An Investigation of the Native Rights of British Subjects" and wrote a Supplement to it in the year following Since that time he has written "Impartial Thoughts on the beneficial Consequences of inrolling all Deeds Wills and Codicils affecting Lands" an octavo pamphlet published in "The Case stated" a pamphlet occasioned by the Act of Parliament passed for the relief of the English Roman Catholics  Jura Anglorum  an octavo volume published in a short History of the British Empire from May to the Close of the year an octavo volume "A friendly and constitutional Address to the People of Great Britain" an octavo pamphlet published in a short History of the British Empire during the year an octavo volume "Church and State being an Enquiry into the Origin Nature and Extent of ecclesiastical and civil Authority with Reference to the British Constitution" a quarto volume published in and a Treatise upon  the Law of Usury and Annuities an octavo volume published in As a writer Dr Plowden is generally ingenious but sometimes too dogmatical "Church and State" is his most distinguished work which will be a lasting monument to his honour as a christian a man a scholar and a lawyer  PLYMLEY REV JOSEPH AM  Archdeacon of Salop In the diocese of Hereford He has published three "Charges" given at the visitation of his Archdeaconry and a Sermon preached at a triennial visitation of the Bishop of Hereford  POLE THOMAS ESQ  Member of the Corporation of Surgeons in London and author of "The Anatomical Instructor" an illustration of the methods of preparing and preserving the different parts of the human body c published in an octavo volume in  POLWHELE REV RICHARD  Of Polwhele in Cornwall A respectable divine a very pleasing poet but a less successful historian He was born in at his abovementioned patrimonial estate was educated at the neighbouring grammarschool of Truro became a member of ChristChurch College Oxford was admitted a student in civil law afterward took orders and was for ten years curate of Kenton near Exeter Before Mr Polwhele left Truroschool he wrote and published the Fate of Lewellyn a legendary tale the Genius of Karnbre a poem the Spirit of Fraser to General Burgoyne an ode the Death of Hilda an American tale an Ode to Mrs Macaulay on her Birthday the Castle of Tintadgel an ode and the Isle of Poplars an ode the two last of which were published among Rack's Essays It is curious that the versification of his first production "The Fate of Lewellyn" is much more melodious than that of his "English Orator" which is nearly the last but the Tale was written to please the ear only In Mr Polwhele published anonymously Book I▪ of "The Art of Eloquence" a didactic poem and also "Pictures from Nature in twelve Sonnets" each quarto pamphlets The first of these was reprinted in the following year under the title  of "The English Orator" and three more books were afterward added In the year Mr Polwhele also published a Translation into English verse with dissertations and notes of the Idyllia Epigrams and Fragments of Theocritus Bion and Moschus with the Elegies of Tyrtaeus in a quarto volume which was afterward reprinted in two octavos It is said of this work that it was completed in half a year if so it does great credit to the talents of the writer since many of the translations are extremely happy and considered as a whole it is perhaps a formidable rival of the similar production by Mr Fawkes In Mr Polwhele published two octavo volumes of wellwritten Discourses on different Subjects and has since that time produced a quarto volume of "Poems" containing his "English Orator" his "Sonnets" and some other pieces a single Sermon preached in at Kenton Vol I of Historical Views of Devonshire in octavo and Vol II of the History of Devonshire in folio The  former  of the two lastmentioned works is to be completed in five volumes it is a repository of curious notices not interfering with the author's main undertaking the  latter  of them which is to be comprehended in three volumes and the publication of which was commenced with the second volume in Beside these productions Mr Polwhele wrote the Biographical Memoirs of Mr Rack in Collinson's History of Somerset and was  the editor of two octavo volumes of "Poems" by gentlemen of Devon▪ and Cornwall who form a literary society whose meetings are held at stated times at the Globe Inn Exeter and of which Mr Polwhele is one of the oldest members  POPE REV JOHN  This gentleman was the successor of Mr Gilbert Wakefield as tutor in BellesLettres and Classical Literature at the NewCollege Hackney and has made himself appear ridiculous enough by attempting to bring his sprinkling of classical knowledge in competition with the copious waters of that celebrated and excellent scholar He published in a duodecimo volume entitled "Observations on the miraculous Conception" c with Remarks on Mr Wakefield's opinion concerning Mat xxvii and also an octavo volume entitled "Divine Worship founded in Nature and supported by Scripture Authority" with Remarks on Mr Wakefield's arguments against Public Worship and strictures on some parts of his Silva Critica and English Version of the New Testament Previous to these publications we believe he had printed a single Sermon since their appearance he has published two Sermons in an octavo pamphlet The writings of Mr Pope are by no means destitute of ingenuity or liberality  but when in the first instance he attempted a display of learning respecting the word  in opposition to Mr Wakefield his conduct was surely no less illjudged than his comprehension of the force of his adversaries argument was erroneous He has been some time employed upon a course of Remarks on the three Greek Tragedians with which he seems inclined to favour the world  modestly  observing that 'no good edition of 'those authors had yet appeared' The vanity of Mr Pope is indeed too conspicuous  PORSON RICHARD ESQ MA  Greek Professor in the University of Cambridge and formerly Fellow of Trinity College This gentleman is well known not in this country only for his very extraordinary talents and as the best Greek scholar we have He was educated at Etonschool took his degree of B A at Cambridge in was always most eminently distinguished for his classical knowledge and succeeded Mr Cooke in the above Professorship in the year Mr Porson's first regular and avowed publication was his celebrated volume of Letters to Mr Archdeacon Travis in Answer to his Defence of the three Heavenly Witnesses i John v which made its appearance in Of this work the celebrated Mr Gibbon has said that it is the most  acute and accurate piece of criticism which has appeared since the days of Bentley The author's strictures are founded in argument enriched with learning and enlivened with wit and his adversary neither deserves nor finds any quarter at his hands The elegant edition of the seven Plays of Aeschylus without notes without the scholia and without the fragments which was published by Foulis at Glasgow in in a folio volume was clandestinely printed from a text corrected by Mr Porson That gentleman had lent his manuscript corrections and conjectures on the text of Aeschylus to a friend in Scotland they fell into the hands of Foulis and the abovementioned edition was published without the Professor's leave or even knowledge Mr Porson edited the Edition of Heyne's Virgil which was printed in London is at present publishing new editions of Greek Plays with short commentaries by single plays each in an octavo volume some of which have already made their appearance and will shortly we believe produce a new Edition of Aeschylus complete with Notes He has also been for some time preparing for the Cambridge press an Edition of the inedited Greek Lexicon of Photius from the manuscript in Trinity College Library A most elegant and masterly copy of this work which his Herculean talents and exquisite Greek handwriting had produced was not long ago consumed by an accidental fire in a house where it was deposited He  has again however assailed the mighty undertaking and will probably soon favour the world with the truly desirable fruit of his industry  It is needless for us to add our eulogium to the well known merit of Mr Porson as a philologist a very consummate scholar and a most acute and accurate critic Many occasional fugitive productions which have either never reached the press or if printed have appeared anonymously are additional testimonies to the just estimation in which he is held by the literary world We have only to lament that he should live below the measure of abilities so transcendent in contradiction to nature's design in the talents with which she has so liberally endowed him What is genius says an elegant writer without a regulated life And surely the paultry occupation of writing for a party journal  Morning Chronicle  and the unmanly indulgence of every excess and dissipation are most derogatory to a character of firstrate powers and attainments yea verily beneath a Greek Professor in one of our Universities  PORTER THOMAS  The author of a Defence of Unitarianisin published in an octavo volume in and intended as an answer to Dr Hawker's Sermons on  the Divinity of Christ It occasioned a Reply from Dr Hawker which produced a very able rejoinder from Mr Porter  PORTEUS RT REV BEILBY DD  Lord Bishop of London Dean of the Chapel Royal c This learned and amiable prelate after having been Rector of Lambeth and after holding the Bishoprick of Chester for eleven years succeeded to the See of London in the year on the decease of the venerable Dr Lowth and is supposed to have risen to his present high rank through the particular patronage of her Majesty Dr Porteus was educated at Christ's College Cambridge took his degree of B A in obtaining with Baron Maseres the Chancellor's Medals at that University on their first institution was for some time Fellow of the above Society and gained the Seatonian Prize for a poetical Essay on Death in which was published according to the will of the founder His Lordship was also for many years Chaplain to the late Archbishop Secker and in association with Dr Stinton published the seven octavo volumes of Sermons by that eminent divine prefixing a Review of his Grace's Life and Character In the year Dr Porteus distinguished himself by his exertions to establish a more solemn observation of the Fast GoodFriday and published  in that year a serious affectionate and sensible "Exhortation" to that effect This produced a rude illnatured attack upon his Lordship from the late Mr Robert Robinson of Chesterton near Cambridge who published the History and Mystery of GoodFriday in order to ridicule the observance of it Having previously printed several occasional single Sermons Dr Porteus published in "A Brief Confutation of the Errors of the Church of Rome" extracted from Archbishop Secker's five Sermons against Popery and designed for general distribution Two years after this he produced a volume of Sermons on several subjects to which he added a second volume in the year In both of these volumes many of the occasional single Sermons which his Lordship had formerly printed were republished and they are well known to rank among the most perfect examples of pulpit eloquence in our language Dr Porteus has also published a Letter to the Clergy of the Diocese of Chester concerning Sunday Schools and a Charge delivered to the Clergy of the Diocese of London at the primary Visitation in His Lordship's poetical talents have been handsomely complimented by Hannah More in her poem Sensibility His style in prose composition is always classical and correct but perhaps he is too studious of avoiding the blandishments of ornament and fancy In his episcopal character he is a pattern of propriety of conduct  POTT REV JOSEPH HOLDEN  Prebendary of Lincoln Archdeacon of St Albans and formerly of St John's College Cambridge This gentleman is a son of the late eminent Surgeon Percival Pott He published in an octavo volume of "Poems" consisting of odes elegies c and three years afterward an octavo volume of "Elegies" with Selmane a tragedy neither of these productions possesses very distinguished pretensions to merit Since that time Mr Pott has published four Charges to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of St Albans two Sermons for the Festivals and Fasts of the Church of England three single Sermons preached upon particular occasions and a duodecimo volume of "Elementary Discourses" designed for the use of a young person after confirmation His writings in the class of divinity have always been highly acceptable  POTTER REV R FRAS  Minister of Scarning and a character of the highest distinction as a classical scholar The literary world is most intrinsically indebted to him for excellent poetical versions of the three Greek Tragedians Mr Potter published in an oc+tavo  volume of "Poems" most of the pieces in which had before appeared separately It contains many very pretty compositions particularly a beautiful farewell Hymn to the country in imitation of Spenser Three years after this his Translation of Aeschylus made its appearance in a quarto volume and has ever since been reprinted with the addition of notes in two volumes octavo Of the excellence of this translation it is hardly possible to say too much many of the parts are so exquisitely beautiful as to leave us in doubt whether any poet we have ever heard of could have accomplished the task with greater success In Mr Potter published Vol I in quarto of his Translation of Euripides to which Vol II was added in the year following and in his Translation of Sophocles was published in a quarto volume These lastmentioned versions are certainly upon the whole inferior to Mr Potter's first production yet they are each of them excellent performances and far superior to those of our former translators Mr Wodhull and Dr Franklin Beside these laborious works Mr Potter published in "An Enquiry into some Passages in Dr Johnson's Lives of the Poets" a quarto pamphlet and in a Translation of the Oracle concerning Babylon and the Song of Exultation from Isaiah chap xiii and xiv  In his weightiest character the Translator of the Greek Tragedians we must again compliment  Mr Potter on the very singular service which he has done to the literary world It was an undertaking which to many must have appeared too great for the life of man and considering the success with which so much labour has been accomplished considering also the amiable character which Mr Potter bears as a member of society we are surprised that he has not long ago attracted the notice of those who are able and willing to confer honours and preferments where they meet with peculiar desert  POTTER JOHN  Author of the History and Adventures of Arthur O'Bradley the Curate of Coventry the Virtuous Villagers the Favourites of Felicity and Frederic all novels the morality of some of which is extremely lax and the composition of all of them very indifferent  POWELL JOHN JOSEPH ESQ  Of the Middle Temple Barrister at Law and a distinguished writer in the law department He published in an excellent Treatise on the Law of Mortgages in an octavo volume and has since that time written an Essay on the Learning  respecting the Creation and Execution of Powers an octavo volume an Essay upon the Learning of Devises an octavo volume and an Essay on the Law of Contracts and Agreements in two octavo volumes Mr Powell also humanely undertook to complete the second volume of the late Mr Fearne's Essay on the Learning of contingent Remainders and executory Devises for the benefit of his widow her husband having only lived to finish the first volume  PRATT ROBERT  This voluminous gentleman was some time ago a bookseller of the City of Bath His first attempt at distinction consisted in reading passages of some of the most celebrated poets in public When he first assumed the character of an author his signature was  Courtney Melmoth  under which his first production in the year was a quarto pamphlet of wretched stanzas entitled "The Tears of Genius occasioned by the Death of Dr Goldsmith" In the year following Mr Courtney Melmoth produced Vols I and II in duodecimo of "Liberal Opinions upon Animals Man and Providence" with the History of Benignus a miserable farrago which dragged its senseless length to six volumes Mr Courtney soon afterward published Observations on Young's  Nights Thoughts in an octavo volume the Pupil of Pleasure a novel in  illustration  of the system in Lord Chesterfield's Letters and in which the hero of the piece is divested of every sentiment of honour delicacy and humanity the Sublime and Beautiful of Scripture in two duodecimo volumes an Apology for the Life and Writings of David Hume Esq in a duodecimo volume Travels for the Heart in two duodecimo volumes the Shadows of Shakspeare a monody occasioned by the death of Mr Garrick and honoured with a BathEaston Prize Shenstone Green a novel in three duodecimo volumes founded on the passage in Shenstone's works  Had I a fortune of eight or ten thousand pounds a year I would build myself a neighbourhood  the Tutor of Truth a novel in opposition to the Pupil of Pleasure and Emma Corbet a novel in three duodecimo volumes published in  MrCourtney Melmoth having by this time scribbled himself out of notice "Sympathy" a poem was published anonymously in and in the same year the Fair Circassian a tragedy taken from Hawkesworth's  Almoran and Hamet  was produced at Drury Lane and published BY MR PRATT with a dedication to the Prince of Wales Since this time Mr Pratt has always prefixed his name to his productions In the year he brought out a Comedy at Drury Lane entitled "The School for Vanity" which was perhaps rather  capriciously condemned and two years afterward he published "Landscapes in Verse" a poem and four crown octavo volumes of "Miscellanies" in which many of his former fugitive pieces were reprinted Mr Pratt's next productions were "The Triumph of Benevolence" a poem occasioned by the design of erecting a monument to Mr Howard "Humanity" a poem and an Ode on his Majesty's Recovery after which his absence on the Continent afforded his pen a long repose On his return he made in an offering of his Muse to his native country by an Ode to the Benevolence of England and another to the pockets of his countrymen by three octavo volumes of "Gleanings" through Wales Holland aad Westphalia Since that time Mr Pratt has written a novel in five duodecimo volumes entitled "Family Secrets Literary and Domestic" and two threepenny Letters one to the British Soldiers the other to the Tars of old England  A short time before Mr Pratt's return from the Continent the following paragraph was inserted for several days successively in the London newspapers  A few days since died at Basle in Swisserland the ingenious Mr Pratt His loss will be severely felt by the literary world as he joined to the accomplishments of the gentleman the erudition of the scholar  Soon afterward came a second paragraph as follows  As no event of late has caused a more general  than the supposed death of the ingenious MrPratt we are happy to have it in our power to assure his numerous admirers that he is as well as they can wish and what they will be delighted to hear busied in preparing his TRAVELS for the press  It is difficult to say which of Mr Pratt's literary productions have been most approved By the above list of them the reader will observe that he may say with Dr Johnson 'he has  written  his share' Beside these we only recollect a farce entitled "Joseph Andrews" which was acted at Drury Lane in for Mr Bensley's benefit but never printed Of his verses we think "The Triumph of Benevolence" the best Upon the whole the stationers and printers must thank him for his excellent custom but if he ever wrote for same he seems mightily to have mistaken the means of obtaining his object▪  PRESCOTT MISS ANN  This lady is the surviving prop of Animal Magnetism in Bloomsbury Square During the life time of the late Dr de Mainauduc she was the only person allowed to assist the Doctor in delivering his lectures and in communicating his twohundredguinea secret Upon his death finding herself his executrix she issued  by the advice of the  late Dr's Friends  Proposals for Publishing his Lectures by subscription These lectures are divided into THREE PARTS the first of which she begged to offer

of the Lodge of Antiquity No I He is a native of Edinburgh born in was for some time amanuensis to the celebrated Thomas Ruddiman and apprentice to his brother the printer and has since that time become a superintendent of the press of Mr Strahan in London While in Scotland he compiled a Catalogue of Mr Ruddiman's Books and in May delivered an Oration on the Institution of Masonry at a grand gala of eminent brethren held at the Crown and Anchor Tavern in the Strand This composition was afterward printed in the first edition of Mr Preston's "Illustrations of Masonry" a wellwritten panegyrical view of that celebrated fraternity published the same year Having been appointed to the office of Deputy Grand Secretary under James Heseltine Esq he compiled for the benefit of the charity the History of Remarkable  Occurrences inserted in the two first publications of the Freemasons Calendar prepared for the press an Appendix to the Book of Constitutions and from the various memoranda he had made formed the History of Masonry which was afterward printed in his ILLUSTRATIONS A dispute taking place in between the Grand Lodge and the Lodge of Antiquity Mr Preston took the part of the Lodge and his private friends in consequence of which his name was erased from the Hall Committee and he was afterward with several gentlemen Members of that Lodge expelled the Society The treatment which he and his friends experienced on this occasion was circumstantially related in a pamphlet entitled "A State of Facts c" which was printed by Mr Preston at his own expence and circulated among his friends but never sold the leading circumstances were also recorded in some of the latter editions of his ILLUSTRATIONS Ten years afterward however Mr Preston and all the other Members of the Lodge of Antiquity were reinstated by the Grand Lodge in a handsome manner  PRESTON WILLIAM ESQ  Of Gloucester Street Dublin This gentleman published in two octavo volumes of his "Poetical Works" some of which had been published  separately as long ago as the year Among these poems are many pieces of very considerable merit and the public are likely to be favoured with a third volume Mr Preston has also published "Democratic Rage or Louis the Unfortunate" a political tragedy and a Letter to Brian Edwards Esq containing Observations on some passages of his History of the West Indies  PRESTON RICHARD ESQ  Of the Inner Temple Author of a very useful elementary Treatise by way of essay on the Quantity of Estates c published in an octavo volume in to which he has since added by way of supplement a succinct View of the Rule in Shelley's Case Mr Preston has also published No I in octavo of a Collection of Law Tracts  PRETTYMAN RT REV GEORGE DD  Lord Bishop of Lincoln and Dean of St Paul's This distinguished prelate was born with humble prospects in life at Bury St Edmund's in Suffolk He was educated at Pembroke Hall Cambridge and took his degree of B A with the greatest distinction in the year Dr Turner the present Dean of Norwich was his senior by a few  and when Mr Pitt and the late son of Lord Elliot came to the above College the latter became the private pupil of Dr Turner and Mr Pitt was given to Dr Prettyman The pains which the preceptor took with the embryo glory of his country were afterward gratefully and deservedly repaid by the Mitre which he now wears His Lordship was for some time private Secretary to Mr Pitt and has most usefully assisted him by the application of those talents for calculation and financial skill which he had unsuspectingly cultivated in the groves of the academy The publications of Dr Prettyman have only been one or two occasional single Sermons the first of which appeared in In a late Charge to his Clergy his Lordship attacked Dr Geddes with the imputation of infidelity in denying the divine authority of the Pentateuch  PRICE UVEDALE ESQ  A very distinguished Connoisseur in the Picturesque He published in the year in an octavo volume a Translation from the Greek of the Account by Pausanias of the Statues Pictures and Temples in Greece when he travelled over all its states about the th year of the Christian aera In he wrote an Essay on the Picturesque as compared with the sublime and the  beautiful in an octavo volume which was attacked with propriety by Mr H Repton the landscape painter in a Letter to Mr Price vindicating Mr Brown's and his own principles of improvement To this Letter Mr Price published a concessive Answer and has since written "Thoughts on the Defence of Property" a small pamphlet  PRICE JOSEPH ESQ  A native of Wales and formerly a Captain in the army Some years ago he wrote many pamphlets on the subject of our Transactions in the East Indies and was a strentious defender of  things as they are  in that country His Reply to the Travels of Mackintosh vide that name was chiefly noticed A Collection has been made of his Tracts in four octavo volumes  PRICE JOHN  The author of an Historical and Topographical Account of Leominster and its Vicinity published in an octavo volume in and of an Historical Account of the City of Hereford in an octavo volume published the year following The last of these is a very respectable performance and perhaps preferable to the first Mr Price has also we believe  written "The Seaman's Return" a farce acte at provincial theatres  PRIESTLEY REV JOSEPH LLD FRS  Fellow of many foreign societies and a dissenting Clergyman late of Hackney This celebrated character was born at Fieldhead near Bristall about seven miles from Leeds in the year His father was a merchant and manufacturer he received the early part of his education from the Rev Mr Scott a dissenting minister in the neighbourhood and completed it under Mr Ashworth near Daventry in Northamptonshire Dr Priestley was educated in the strictest principles of calvinism about the age of twenty he became an Arian in which persuasion he continued for fifteen or sixteen years and at length embraced the doctrines of Socinus to which he was chiefly led by Dr Lardner's Letters on the Logos He was for several years Tutor in the Languages and BellesLettres at the late dissenting academy of Warrington whence he returned to his native county and took upon himself the pastoral office at MillHill Chapel Leeds In the year being appointed Chaplain and Librarian to the Marquis of Lansdown then Lord Shelburne he quitted that situation and resided with his Lordship for nearly seven years A coolness taking place between them  and Dr Priestley having received an invitation to settle with a society of protestant dissenters at Birmingham he undertook the pastorship of the new meeting of that town on the last day of the year Here he long remained undisturbed although his pulpit Discourses his political pamphlets and his private conversation were well known to be highly inimical to the Government of his country and especially to her ecclesiastical constitution But his declamatory vehemence and the indecency of his conduct to the neighbouring clergy caused him to be viewed by the lower classes in Birmingham as a turbulent seditious man and in July a flame which had for a long time been gaining strength under suppression broke out with dreadful fury upon his devoted head A most infamous libel had been circulated which was of itself sufficient to inflame the minds of the populace and the fabrication of this paper was ignorantly attributed to Dr Priestley Attached to the Constitution of their country they resolved to inflict the heaviest vengeance upon the man who dared thus to insult them and the consequences were dreadful indeed For some days Birmingham was a miserable scene of popular fury Houses were pillaged meetinghouses burned and no bounds could have been put to the fury of the enraged mob had it not been for the wise dispassionate conduct of the neighbouring nobility and gentry who at length succeeded in restoring  peace to the distracted town Dr Priestley suffered severely His house his library with numerous unpublished manuscripts his laboratory and valuable philosophical apparatus were all destroyed Part of the mob inflamed with liquor and more savage than the rest had actually conceived the horrid design of taking away his life but the previous intelligence he had received enabled him to elude their vengeance and they contented themselves with burning his effigy Upon his arrival in London Dr Priestley published a Letter couched in haughty terms by which he seemed to consider himself as persecuted for righteousness' sake and soon afterward he accepted an invitation to succeed the late Dr Price at the NewCollege Hackney His misfortunes had not however cured him of his political frenzy and his conduct being at length marked by Government a polite intimation was given him to quit the country Upon this he emigrated to America and settled at NorthumberlandTown He was not long ago a candidate for the office of Chaplain to the House of Assembly at New York but had a minority of votes in favour of Dr Green  Of the numerous literary productions by Dr Priestley the first was a Treatise on the Rudiments of English Grammar which was published in a duodecimo volume in and seven years afterward republished with great additions and improvements in an octavo volume This first work  was followed in by his useful Charts of Biography and of Universal History and by an Essay on Liberal Education in an octavo volume In Dr Priestley published an History of Electricity in a quarto volume and a familiar Introduction to the Study of Electricity in a quarto pamphlet and in the year following a Pamphlet on the Lord's Supper a small Catechism and an Essay on the first Principles of Government in an octavo volume In was published Vol I in octavo of the Theological Repository consisting of original essays hints queries c calculated to promote religious knowledge a

Hackney Experiments and Observations relating to the Analysis of Atmospherical Air first published in America and reprinted in London and several Papers printed at  sundry times in Philosophical

catholic clergyman with Mr Whitehead a quaker with Dr Price and Mr Palmer dissenting ministers and Mr Jacob Bryant on the subjects of Materialism and Philosophical Necessity with Bishop Newcome on the duration of our Lord's Ministry with Mr Hammon a pretended atheist with Bishop Horsley Mr Badcock Mr Burn Mr Hawkins the Jews particularly Mr Levi and the followers of Baron Swedenborg and lastly with Mr Brian Higgins in particular on Natural Philosophy A short but curious correspondence between Mr Gibbon and Dr Priestley may also be seen in Lord Sheffield's publication of that gentleman's posthumous Works in which though the Historian seems well to understand the  direct tendency  of the Doctor's character and opinions the temper of the divine appears to much greater advantage than that of his antagonist  Of the abilities of Dr Priestley none can hesitate to pronounce that they are of firstrate excellence His philosophical enquiries and publications claim the greatest distinction and have materially contributed to the advancement of science As an experimental philosopher he is perhaps the very  first of his age He has also been a most industrious divine and had he proved as diligent in propagating truth as in disseminating error in establishing the gospel in the minds of men instead of shaking their belief in the doctrines of revelation perhaps few characters of the present century would have ranked higher as learned men or have been held in greater estimation On the contrary his political and theological writings must be pronounced to be fraught with principles the most destructive to the wellbeing of society It was a saying of Dr Johnson that they were calculated to unsettle every thing but to settle nothing The undaunted and unremitting constancy with which he has pursued the establishment of his speculative doctrines has done infinitely more than was to be wished toward giving popularity to his metaphysical and theological sentiments and if their apprehended effect has fortunately been counteracted it is probably owing to their violence rather than to any other cause The pillars of revelation says Mr Gibbon are shaken by those men who preserve the name without the substance of religion who indulge the licence without the temper of philosophy  PRIESTLEY REV TIMOTHY  Brother to the subject of the preceeding article

encampment at Coxheath In he published with his name the Progress of Refinement a poem and four years afterward "Poems on various Subjects" in two octavo volumes in which all of the pieces above referredto were collected and a few new ones added A very elegant English Translation of the Song of Harmodius and Aristogeiton in which the turn of expression of the original has been imitated with extraordinary felicity is to be found among other excellent pieces in this collection Mr Pye's subsequent publications have been a Translation of the Poetic of Aristotle first published in an octavo volume in and afterward prefixed to a Commentary on that work published in a quarto volume Amusement a poetical  essay published in the War Elegies of Tyrtaeus imitated and addressed to the People of Great Britain published in the Siege of Meaux a tragedy acted at Covent Garden Theatre and Leonore a tale translated from the German of Burger He is also speedily about to present the public with a Poem on the Origin and Progress of Navigation which as we have understood is to close with a splendid apostrophe commemorating our late glorious naval victories  The poetry of Mr Pye cannot perhaps upon the whole be said to be of that very superior kind which has universally exacted from his readers the applause of firstrate excellence Yet none can deny that he is always the elegant scholar the man of taste and fancy and the writer of polished versification while the great interests of virtue and public spirithave uniformly been countenanced by his pen His ARISTOTLE though a performance of considerable merit has been displaced by the work so singularly masterly of Mr Twining Among the several translators of the abovemen+tioned German tale he is certainly the best  PYLE REV PHILIP  Rector of Castle Rising and Lynn St Edmund in Norfolk This gentleman edited his father's Sermons in three volumes octavo and published  in one hundred and twenty popular Sermons in four volumes octavo

ESQ MD  FELLOW of the King's and Queen's College of Physicians Physiciangeneral of his Majesty's Army in Ireland and of the Royal Hospital for Invalids near Dublin This gentleman has written an interesting Treatise on the Dropsy of the Brain illustrated by a variety of cases which was published in an octavo volume in  R  RADOLIFFE MRS ANN  A LADY of great distinction in the literary world as a Novelwriter We believe her first production in this class was "The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne" an highland story published in a duodecimo volume in Since that time she has written "A Sicilian Romance" in two duodecimo volumes the Romance of the Forest in three duodecimo volumes the Mysteries of Udolpho in four duodecimo volumes and the Italian in three duodecimo volumes They have all been very generally read and admired especially the Romance of the Forest and the Mysteries of Udolpho Her powers of pleasing in this line of composition are very singularly great and the happy combination of various talents which her pieces display entitles their author to rank among the first novelwriters of her age while the beautiful verses interspersed among her tales must raise her highly in the estimation of every poetical genius Beside these Romances Mrs Radcliffe published in in a quarto volume "A Journey made in the Summer of through Holland and the Western Frontier of Germany with a Return down the Rhine to  which are added Observations during a Tour to the Lakes of Westmoreland and Cumberland" This volume was afterward reprinted in two octavos It is a wellwritten entertaining and authentic work and adds a new laurel to the brows of the fair writer  RADCLIFFE WILLIAM  Of Oriel College Oxford This gentleman has translated from the French "A Journey through Sweden containing a detailed Account of its Population Agriculture Commerce and Finances" and "The Natural History of East Tartary traced through the three Kingdoms of Nature" originally published at Petersburgh by the Academy of Sciences Each of these Translations were published in an octavo volume in  RAITHBY  A LawStationer He has written Henry Bennet a novel in three volumes which is an attempt in the manner of Fielding not destitute of merit  RAMSAY DAVID ESQ MD  A native and President of the Senate of South Carolina He has distinguished himself as a warm friend to human liberty In he published the History of the Revolution of South Carolina in two octavo volumes printed in America and in the History of the American Revolution in two octavo volumes Both of these performances display a very commendable degree of integrity temper liberality penetration and knowledge The first Oration which was spoken at the public celebration of the establishment of American independence was delivered by Dr Ramsay and after a lapse of sixteen years he was again called upon to perform the same office July th The excellent Speech he made was published in London the year following in an octavo pamphlet  RAMSDEN J  Mathematical Optical and Philosophical Instrumentmaker in Piccadilly He is one of the few workmen of this description who unite great scientific knowledge with much practical skill He has made several inventions and improvements in the instruments used in the practical parts of natural philosophy  which are greatly to the credit of his ingenuity and which constitute him a worthy promoter of science For the invention of his celebrated Machine for dividing Mathematical Instruments he received six hundred and fifteen pounds on certain conditions from the commissioners of longitude Of this Machine he published a Description in in a quarto volume by order of the abovementioned commissioners and has also occasionally written Papers in the Philosophical Transactions  RAMSDEN REV RICHARD MA  Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge and a very superior Classical Scholar He took his degree of B A in the University with great distinction in and has written perhaps the  best  Greek Ode in imitation of Sappho on the subject of the Siege of Gibraltar which the legacy of Sir William Browne has ever produced Mr Ramsden has of late attracted a good deal of notice by the publication of two singular Sermons on the Right to Life preached before the University They are the production of an imagination extraordinarily poetical and have been read by many understood by few and translated into English metre by  one  RANDOLPH REV JOHN DD  Canon of Christ Church and Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of Oxford and late Greek Professor in that University This gentleman's first publication was a Sermon preached at an ordination at Christ Church in Since that time he has published a Sermon at the consecration of Dr Lewis Bagot in to the Bishoprick of Bristol  De Graecoe Linguae studio

Socinian Arguments" in a letter to Dr Priestley which does him very great credit The latter of these productions produced a Reply from Benjamin Hobhouse Esq which occasioned Mr Randolph to publish in a pamphlet entitled "Scriptural  Revision of Socinian Arguments vindicated" This Vindication likewise produced an Answer from Mr Hobhouse  RASPE RUDOLPHUS ERICUS  A foreigner of distinguished reputation and merit He edited the posthumous writings of the celebrated Leibnitz and published at Leipzig in  Specimen Historiae Naturalis Globi terraquei c  an essay in octavo chiefly relating to the formation of islands the origin of mountains and the phenomena of petrified bodies In he published in London an Account of some German Volcanos and their Productions in an octavo volume and has since that time produced a Translation of Ferber's Philosophical Travels in an octavo volume an Essay on Oil Painting in quarto Tabby in Elysium a poem and a Translation from the German of Baron Inigo

accurate and judicious work published in an octavo volume in  REED ISAAC ESQ  Of Staple's Inn Barrister at Law and a very distinguished editor of dramatic writings He edited the Collection of old Plays in twelve duodecimo volumes published by Dodsley in and lately republished and also in consequence of a very flattering application from Mr Stevens the tenoctavovolume edition of Shakspeare's Plays published in Mr Reed has moreover we believe written "Biographia Dramatica" in two duodecimo volumes No man is more conversant than this gentleman with English publications both ancient and modern and no man more willing to assist the literary undertakings of others  REES REV ABRAHAM DD FRS  A Dissenting Minister of Hackney and we believe one of the tutors at the New College His principal work is the last improved edition of Chamber's Cyclopaedia in four large folio volumes a task which he has performed with very considerable care and success Dr Rees has also published several occasional single Sermons the last of which  was on the Death of his intimate friend Dr Kippis He was formerly concerned in the Monthly Review  REES THOMAS  The author of a new System of Stenography which has been favourably received but which is too concise in its principles to be of very general utility  REEVE MRS CLARA  A literary lady of much ingenuity resident at Ipswich in Suffolk Her first publication was a Translation from the Latin of the fine old romance Barclay's Argenis which made its appearance in in four duodecimo volumes under the title "The Phoenix or the History of Polyarchus and Argenis" She next wrote the Champion of Virtue a Gothic story which was published in and was republished in the following year under the title it has ever since retained viz "The Old English Baron" Mrs Reeve has since that time written the two Mentors a modern story "The Progress of Romance through Times Countries and Manners" in a course of interesting and wellwritten evening conversations The Exile or Memoirs of the Count de Cronstadt the principal incidents  of which are borrowed from a novel by M D'Arnaud the School for Widows a novel "Plans of Education" with remarks on the system of other writers in a duodecimo volume and Memoirs of Sir Roger de Clarendon a natural Son of Edward the Black Prince with Anecdotes of many other eminent persons of the fourteenth century in three duodecimo volumes It is hardly necessary for us to add concerning a writer so well known as Mrs Reeve that her works discover her to have cultivated useful knowledge with considerable success and to have applied that knowledge less frivolously than is frequently the case with female authors  REEVES JOHN ESQ  Barrister at Law and author of a very valuable History of the English Law from the time of the Saxons to the end of the Reign of Phillip and Mary published in two volumes quarto in and afterward reprinted in four octavo volumes Mr Reeves has also written a History of the Law of Shipping and Navigation History of the Government of the Island of Newfoundland and Thoughts on the English Government in a letter  REID REV THOMAS DD FRSE  Late Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Glasgow He was the most scientific and distinguished of the three  Reid Beattie and Oswald They were answered by Dr Priestley  Scotish defenders of the celebrated doctrine COMMON SENSE His earliest publication was upon this subject It was an octavo volume published in and entitled "An Enquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense" The great object of this volume was to refute certain principles with regard to the human understanding which had for a long time been commonly adopted by philosophers and upon which Bishop Berkeley and Mr Hume had at last erected a system of scepticism It was received with a degree of favour seldom shewn to metaphysical disquisitions In the year Dr Reid published "Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man" in a quarto volume This treatise is written upon a much more extensive plan than the former and comprehends an account of all the powers of the human understanding A few years afterward in continuation of his general plan and in completion of the analysis which he proposed to make of the human mind Dr Reid  published "Essays on the active Powers of Man" in a quarto volume His writings have found many admirers  REID THOMAS ESQ MD FAS  Formerly of the Isle of Thanet He published in an Essay on the Nature and Cure of the  Phthisis Pulmonalis  in an octavo volume which was greatly enlarged and improved in a second edition Dr Reid has written since that time Directions for Warm and Cold Seabathing a pamphlet of considerable merit  REID WILLIAM HAMILTON  A Translator of foreign Newspapers and a frequent writer in our Magazines He has published a Collection of his Poems which cannot be said to rank above mediocrity  REIDE THOMAS DICKSON  An ArmySurgeon Author of a useful View of the Diseases of the Army published in an octavo volume in which confirms the practice adopted by Doctors Millar Robertson and Clarke  RENNELL JAMES ESQ FRS  A gentleman of very extensive and very accurate knowledge He was formerly Major of Engineers and Surveyorgeneral in Bengal and is highly celebrated as the delineator of a very beautiful map of Hindostan This map was first published in accompanied by a "Memoir" in a quarto volume consisting of illustrations of Indian Geography Five years afterward the Memoir was republished in a thicker volume with great improvements Major Rennell has written since that time "The Marches of the British Armies in the Peninsula of India during the Campaigns of and illustrated and explained by reference to a Map compiled from authentic Documents transmitted by Earl Cornwallis from India" published in in an octavo volume Memoir of a Map of the Peninsula of India from the latest authorities published the year following in a quarto volume and Observations on a Current that often prevails to the Westward of Sicily a quarto pamphlet To the third edition of Major Rennell's firstméntioned Memoir published in was added the second supplementary map containing the new geography of the Peninsula of India and also the explanatory memoir It is hardly necessary for us to add that this gentleman ranks  among the very first geographers and that his country is very deeply indebted to his labours  RENNELL REV THOMAS DD  Prebendary of Winchester Rector of St Magnus in the City of London and late Fellow of King's College Cambridge This stout and worthy pillar of the church has of late distinguished himself by the publication of several very excellent single Sermons preached for the most part on particular occasions Among them are "Principles of French Republicanism essentially founded on Violence and Bloodguiltiness" a Sermon occasioned by the Murder of Her Most Christian Majesty "The Consequences of the Vice of Gaming as they effect the Welfare of Individuals and the Stability of Civil Government considered" and "The Services rendered to the Church of England by the English Nation a Motive for Liberality to the indigent Ministers of that Church" preached at the anniversary meeting of the Sons of the Clergy it St Paul's May th One or two more single Discourses from these excellent hands have also reached the press Dr Rennell merits the highest estimation from all good men for the energy with which his conduct as a minister of the gospel has of late years been marked No wellwisher to his country has heard his eloquent harangues  or admired in private in his closet his piety his patriotism and his erudition without wishing that our religion and our morals had in these times many more supports so able and so active  The celebrated satirical poem THE PURSUITS OF LITERATURE was at one time confidently attributed to this gentleman on this subject we refer the reader to the note at page of our first volume Dr Rennell married a daughter of the celebrated Sir William Blackstone  RENWICK WILLIAM  Surgeon in the Royal Navy He published in a pamphlet which he entitled "An Attempt to restore the primitive natural Constitutions of Mankind c" and has since that time published three Addresses to Parliament on the Situation of the Navy Surgeons and an Enquiry into the Nature and Causes of Sickness in Ships of War an octavo pamphlet  REPTON H ESQ  A very distinguished proficient in the art of drawing who has been consulted in the improvement of many of the seats of gentlemen of fortune He was engaged in a controversy with Mr  Uvedale Price in the year on the subject of the Picturesque and upon the publication of that gentleman's  Essay  published a "Letter" to him in vindication of Mr Brown's and his own Principles of improvement Since that time Mr Repton has published "Sketches and Hints on Landscape Gardening" an elegant work in a folio volume We believe he is also the author of an octavo volume of Essays published in under the title "Variety"  REYNOLDS FREDERIC ESQ  A successful Dramatic Writer of the day He is the younger son of Mr Reynold's Solicitor to Lord Chatham and brother to a barrister of that name He was himself after an education at Westminsterschool brought up to the law but has never been called to the bar The first production of Mr Reynolds was Werter a tragedy taken from a novel of the celebrated Goethe which was first rejected by Mr Harris afterward represented with success on the Bath stage and finally brought out at Covent Garden He next produced Eloisa a tragedy taken from Rousseau which lasted three nights at Covent Garden and cleared the author  eight pounds  Here ended Mr Reynolds' attempts in tragedy In the year he produced at Covent Garden his whimsical  comedy entitled "The Dramatist" which succeeded in creating the laughter of our modern audiences to the astonishment of all who read it in their closets Since that time Mr Reynolds has furnished Covent Garden Theatre with the Crusade an opera and Notoriety How to Grow Rich the Rage Speculation Fortune's Fool the Will and Cheap Living comedies All of these pieces have reached the press The last but one has been not unaptly called by Mr William Gifford a  Bartholomewfair farce  indeed the same name is but too applicable to most of them Upon the whole perhaps the Dramatist is the best of Mr Reynolds' dramatic productions but they all bear in every scene the badges of that corrupt and pitiful taste so lamentably but so strongly the characteristic of the age in which they were written We have already alas had but too frequent opportunity  Vide Morton O'Keefe c  of expressing the concern we feel upon this occasion  REYNOLDS HENRY REVELL ESQ  Of Gray's Inn Son of the physician of the same name and Member of Trinity College Cambridge This gentleman published in the year a duodecimo volume which he entitled  "An Address to the Ladies from a young Man" This production by no means to the credit of the times be it said reached in a short time a second edition We will only add that the subject itself and more especially the indecent manner in which it is treated considering to  whom  it is addressed are unworthy of a writer who professes in his preface to have been lately studying mathematics and totally unworthy of an academic and a scholar  RICHARDS GEORGE MA  Fellow of Oriel College Oxford and a gentleman whose poetical talents have very considerable claims to distinction We believe that his first publication was his beautiful poem "The Aboriginal Britons" which was printed in having been publicly recited at Oxford during an Act in consequence of a prize adjudged to its author the donation of an unknown person Almost all the copies of the first impression of this masterly production were sold on the day of publication Mr Richards' subsequent pieces have been "Songs of the Aboriginal Bards of Britain" published in a quarto pamphlet in "Modern France" a poem published in a quarto pamphlet the year following and "Matilda or the Dying Penitent" a poetical epistle published in a quarto pamphlet in all of which are worthy of the author  of "The Aboriginal Britons" If this gentleman shall prove duly attentive to the cultivation of his talent for poetry these specimens of his early years assuredly afford us the highest promise  RICHARDS REV WILLIAM  A Baptist Minister He was engaged in the year in a controversy with Mr John Carter on Infant Baptism reviewed his  Strictures  on that subject in a pamphlet and wrote another pamphlet entitled Observations on Infant Sprinkling or an Answer to  the Reviewer reviewed  Since that time he has written "The History of Antichrist or Free Thoughts on the Corruptions of Christianity" an octavo pamphlet a Review of Noble's Memoirs of the Protectoral House of Cromwell an octavo pamphlet a Discourse concerning Baptism and Reflections on French Atheism and English Christianity an octavo pamphlet  RICHARDSON JOHN ESQ FAS  A gentleman celebrated for his proficiency in Eastern Languages He was educated at Wadham College Oxford and brought up to the study of the law His first publication was "A Specimen of Persian Poetry or Odes of Hafez with an  English Translation and Paraphrase" which appeared in in a quarto volume Two years afterward he published a Grammar of the Arabic Language and a year or two after this a Persian Arabic and English Dictionary in two volumes folio to which was prefixed a Dissertation on the Language Literature and Manners of the Eastern Nations which was afterward printed separately in an octavo volume These grand performances have put the literary world under the highest obligations to Mr Richardson and the manner in which he has executed them are no less honourable to his abilities than to his learning  RICHARDSON WILLIAM MA FRSE  Professor of Humanity in the University of Glasgow This gentleman republished in in an octavo volume under one uniform title with corrections and more commodious arrangement "Essays on some of Shakspeare's Dramatic Characters" which had appeared separately at distinct times and the earliest of which published in was we believe his first production These pieces have gained Professor Richardson very considerable applause as a critic and as a man of taste He also published in an octavo volume of "Poems chiefly Rural" which were favourably received and ten years afterward " Anecdotes  of the Russian Empire" in a series of letters written from St Petersburgh an octavo volume Since that time Professor Richardson has written the Indians a tragedy performed at the Richmond Theatre and printed in We need hardly add that this gentleman is an elegant and an ingenious writer  RICHARDSON JOSEPH ESQ  Barrister at Law and author of the Fugitive a wellwritten comedy acted at Drury Lane and printed in He has also written we believe some other dramatic Pieces  RICHARDSON W FAS SCOTLAND  Surgeon and author of "The Chemical Principles of the Metallic Arts" a light performance published in an octavo volume in  RICKMAN THOMAS CLIO  A Bookseller in London and a frequent correspondent with periodical publications His compositions are chiefly metrical In he published  "The Fallen Cottage" a poem in a quarto pamphlet  RIPPON REV JOHN DD  A Baptist Minister successor to the late Dr John Gill He has published some single Sermons and a Selection of Hymns He is also editor of a work entitled the Baptist's Annual Register  RITTSON JOSEPH ESQ  Deputy High Bailif of the Dutchy of Lancaster and a conveyancer in the Metropolis of some distinction He is a man of taste and information but more to be commended for his acuteness than for his goodbreeding or his candour We believe his first publication was an anonymous quarto pamphlet in of Observations on the three first volumes of Warton's History of English Poetry which is an ingenious but at the same time one of the most illiberal productions we ever recollect to have seen Mr Rittson has also written anonymously three sets of Remarks on the Editors of Shakspeare the first on Mr Stevens' edition in entitled "Remarks critical and illustrative on the Text and Notes of the last Edition of Shakspeare" an octavo volume the second on Mr  Reed's republication of that edition entitled "The Quip Modest c" and the third on Mr Malone's edition entitled " Cursory Criticisms c" The last of these is particularly illiberal In the year he published with his name a wellexecuted Translation with Notes of the Hymn to Venus which has been ascribed to Homer  The most distinguished character of Mr Rittson in his literary capacity is that of a judicious and intelligent compiler He published in the year a select Collection of English Songs in three octavo volumes and has since that time edited an octavo volume of Ancient Songs from the time of King Henry III to the Revolution an octavo volume of Pieces of Ancient Popular Poetry the English Anthology a selection of poetry in three small octavo volumes "Robin Hood" a collection of ancient poems in two small octavo volumes and a Collection of Scottish Songs with the genuine music in two volumes duodecimo All of his publications except the Translation of the Hymn to Venus have been anonymous  RIVERS REV DAVID  A Dissenting Minister of a small congregation at Highgate He has published a Sermon against Popery a Sermon on a Censorious Temper and Disposition dedicated to the Bishop of Landaff a  Sermon on Faith Hope and Charity a Sermon entitled "The Gospel a perfect Law of Liberty" a volume of Miscellaneous Works to which are prefixed Memoirs of his own Life and "Lord Mayor's Day" an heroic poem published in a quarto pamphlet in Mr Rivers is also the author of several anonymous Pamphlets was a very frequent correspondent with the newspaper called the World while it was under the direction of Captain Topham signing his pieces MARCUS ANTONINUS and has had a principal share in conducting the Sunday Reformer and the Sunday Recorder newspapers He moreover edited "The Beauties of Saurin" a duodecimo volume published in  ROBERTS WILLIAM ESQ  Of WandsworthCommon Surry This gentleman is brother to the Master of St Paul's School and cousin to the late Provost of Eton College of the same name He was formerly an officer in the army but has for many years quitted the service and devoted his attention with considerable success to the education of youth He published in the year a tract of some merit entitled" Thoughts upon Creation c" and two years afterward a thin octavo volume of "Poetical Attempts" The Lookeron a periodical paper is dedicated to this gentleman by his son the author 'as an humble  expression of his love and a still humbler tribute to manly virtue and unblemished integrity of life'  ROBERTS WILLIAM ESQ AM FAS  Of Gray's Inn A gentleman whose literary attainments are of very singular distinction and excellence He is the younger son of the subject of the preceeding article was educated at Corpus Christi College Oxford became a Fellow of that society and was originally destined to the church which he afterward relinquished in favour of the law While at the University he obtained about the year a prize for an Essay on Refinement which is one of the most masterly and elegant performances we almost ever recollect to have seen A few copies only of it were printed for the sake of private distribution Mr Roberts was also about that time a frequent contributor to the English Review which was then certainly the bestconducted literary journal of the day and we believe he also published at the University an Account of the Oxford Marbles in a duodecimo volume On leaving College he travelled for a short time on the continent and soon after his return commenced the publication of his excellent periodical paper "The Lookeron" No I made its appearance in folio March th the first twentyfive numbers were published on Tuesdays and Saturdays  then after an interval of a few months it was continued on Saturdays only and the last number was dated December st Of the few contributors to this work Mr Beresford vide that name was the chief The second edition was printed in three duodecimo volumes and the third in four with some additions  Very few indeed are in our opinion the instances which the English language affords of such finished specimens of essaywriting as are to be found in the Lookeron The taste knowledge and ingenuity the sterling wit the happy raillery and the elegance of style with which these papers are conceived and written must ever characterise them as very firstrate performances of their kind while we know of no instance in particular in which a writer has displayed greater power over the feelings of his readers than in the beautiful and natural story of EUGENIO The reigning whims and follies of the age have never in our opinion since the days of Addison been combated by the weapons of wit and reason with equal address and if the 'urbanity of criticism the elegance of morality and the playfulness of allusion' which so remarkably distinguish the SPECTATOR be any where to be looked for since those days it must be in the lucubrations of Simon Olivebranch The RAMBLER is assuredly the only periodical paper which can by any means aspire to the rank of these two productions and let none incautiously detract from  the solid merit of that performance It has been truly called a body of ethics and to give it the highest possible praise it is a work whose profundity and whose composition are worthy of the great logician and lexicographer whom it owns for its author Yet the charms with which Addison instructs have gained him with most readers a preference to his great successor and the Lookeron with a perfect originality of his own and with the becoming character of a writer of his own time is surely the SPECTATOR rather than the RAMBLER of his day  It is a singular and a melancholy consideration that this work although favourably received has not experienced from the public that extraordinary distinction to which its extraordinary merit certainly entitled it for let it be read for our amusement for the improvement of our taste or for the greater sakes of our religion and our morals it shall be found to answer all our purposes with superior excellence Some blame has perhaps been justly bestowed upon the author for an occasional excess in the amplification of his subjects and for an overwrought nicety of style too like what may be called a false refinement in writing yet these are but as dust in the balance It is not to these causes we fear that we are to look for the evil but to the tastelessness and insipidity of the larger portion of that shallow age in which the work was written Melancholy indeed is the reflection that the good taste which we once undoubtedly  possessed should so far have forsaken us as to neglect such distinguished merit  We shall conclude this article by applying to Mr Roberts the language used by one of Mr Burke's political adversaries when speaking of that transcendent writer alledging as our reason for so doing that we know of no LIVING AUTHOR to whom we think them more properly applicable  He is a writer of the most splendid and unequalled powers the fascination and magic of whose eloquence cannot be withstood His imperial fancy has laid all nature under tribute and has collected riches from every scene of the creation and every walk of art His images are so select so rich with colours dipt in Heaven that whoever can read his works without rapture may have merit as a reasoner but must resign all pretensions to taste and sensibility  Hall's Apology for the Freedom of the Press  ROBERTS WILLIAM ESQ  Of Manchester Barrister at Law In consequence of an action brought against him by Mr Walker Merchant of Manchester and of the Account which was published of the proceedings on the subsequent Trial this gentleman published in a Pamphlet consisting of Supplementary  Facts and Observations on that occasion He has also published the Fugitives a comedy never offered for representation and a Charge to the Grand Jury of the Court Leet for the Manor of Manchester delivered at the Michaelmas Court October th  ROBERTS W MA  Fellow of Eton College and son of

father  ROBERTSON WILLIAM ESQ  One of the Deputies of the Lord ClerkRegister for keeping the Records of Scotland He published in the year "Proceedings relating to the Peerage of Scotland from Jan th to April th in a quarto volume a very laborious and a curious work  ROBERTSON REV THOMAS DD FRSE  Minister of Dalmeney This gentleman published in Vol I of an Enquiry into the Fine Arts a work which we believe has never been continued and for the due execution of which he does not appear to be peculiarly qualified In he published the History of Mary Queen of Scots in a quarto volume in which he vindicates the conduct of that Queen on grounds somewhat different from those of her former apologists This History cannot however upon the whole be said to rank with the best productions which the subject has afforded us  ROBERTSON REV J  Of Mortimer Street London We believe this gentleman's first publication was a single Sermon preached at St John's Westminster on the General Fast In he published a useful Essay on Punctuation which has been favourably received and has seen four editions Having in a note in this Essay appeared to question the authenticity of the Arundelian Marbles he was addressed on the subject in the Gentleman's Magazine  and in he published "The Parian Chronicle" with a Dissertation concerning its authenticity in an octavo volume in which he enlarged on the above opinion and in consequence involved himself in a controversy with Mr Hewlett vide that name Mr Robertson displayed upon this occasion great candour and considerable learning In he published a Translation from the French with Notes of the Adventures of Telemachus in two duodecimo volumes founded on the Translation of Littlebury and Boyer but greatly improved  ROBERTSON ABRAHAM MA  Of Christ Church College Oxford He published in in a quarto volume  Sectionum Conicarum Libri septem Accedit Tractatus de Sectionibus Conicis et de Scriptoribus qui earum doctrinam tradiderunt  This Treatise on the Conic Sections one of the very few books produced by the University of Oxford on subjects of science though not an unvaluable performance will we can venture to say be read by very few  ROBERTSON ROBERT MD  Surgeon in his Majesty's Navy He published in in a quarto pamphlet "A Physical  journal" kept on board the ship Rainbow during three voyages to the coast of Africa and the West Indies in an octavo volume of Observations on the Jail Hospital or Ship Fever and in an Essay on Fevers in an octavo volume in which he rejects every system except his own  ROBERTSON ARCHIBALD  The author of a Topographical Survey of the great Road from London to Bath and Bristol with Plates and Maps published in two octavo volumes in These are elegant volumes  ROBERTSON DAVID ESQ  The author of an agreeable octavo volume entitled "A Tour through the Isle of Man" with a Review of the Mank's History which was published in We believe Mr Robertson had published an octavo volume of Poems about ten years previously  ROBERTSON REV JOSEPH  Minister of Sleighs near Whitby Yorkshire and author of "Seven Sermons preached on particular  Occasions" published in a quarto volume in Some of these discourses which are very respectable compositions had appeared before singly  ROBINS THOMAS  Formerly a Dissenting Minister and Tutor at the Dissenting Academy at Daventry Northamptonshire He pubslihed in a Treatise on Baptism abridged from the original manuscript of the late Mr Matthew Henry in a duodecimo volume  ROBINSON MATTHEW MONTAGU See Montagu  ROBINSON MATTHEW LORD ROKEBY IN THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND  A Nobleman conspicuous for his eccentricities His Lordship is the author of some spirited Political Pamphlets  ROBINSON MRS MARY  The maiden name of this celebrated lady who is descended from a very respectable family was Darby Her father lost his fortune in promoting a scheme for the commercial advantage of this country and afterward accepted the command of a seventyfourgun ship in the service of the late Empress of Russia Her mother is grand daughter to Catharine Seys of Boverton Castle in Glamorganshire whose sister Ann Seys a woman celebrated for her virtues and accomplishments married Lord King then Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain Mrs Robinson was born in the College Green Bristol received the early part of her education in that city and at the age of fifteen married her present husband who was then a student in Lincoln's Inn Shortly afterward she thought it proper to exercise her talents on the stage and came out in Juliet under the particular patronage of the Dutchess of Devonshire on the th of December For three seasons she continued to perform the parts of Lady Macbeth Imogen Rosalind Cordelia Ophelia Viola Palmira the Irish Widow Perdita c with great applause and having in the latter character attracted by her elegance and beauty the notice of a certain distinguished FLORIZEL she quitted the stage at a  time when she was rising rapidly in the estimation of the public  Of the literary productions of Mrs Robinson we believe the first was a small octavo volume of "Poems" published in Two years afterward she wrote "Captivity" a poem and Celadon and Lydia a tale which were printed together in a quarto pamphlet dedicated to her patroness the Dutchess of Devonshire In she brought out a farce entitled "The Lucky Escape" for her own benefit at Drury Lane None of these productions appear to have attracted that notice by which the later writings of their fair author have been so remarkably distinguished and her pen appears to have been unemployed till about the year when she figured in the newspaper THE WORLD under the signature Anna Matilda For an account of the correspondence with Delia Crusca kept up from poetical sympathy at intervals for two years we refer the reader to our memoir of Mr Merry and shall only observe that we think her poems in the collection entitled "The British Album" certainly claim the second place in point of merit Mrs Robinson also produced many pieces about this time in THE ORACLE under the signatures Laura Maria Julia Laura Oberon c In she published a poem inscribed to Mr Merry under the title  Ainsi va le Monde  and in the year following produced her elegant octavo volume of "Poems" which was honoured by a  very splendid list of subscribers The poetical productions with which Mrs Robinson has favoured the world since that publication are a Monody to the Memory of Sir Joshua Reynolds Sight the Cavern of Woe and Solitude published together in a quarto pamphlet Modern Manners a poem by Horace Juvenal a Monody to the Memory of the late Queen of France and Vol II of "Poems" in which some of these pieces are reprinted In the year Mrs Robinson published her first novel "Vancenza" and has since that time written "The Widow" "Angelina" and "Hubert de Sevrac" novels and "The Sicilian Lover" a tragedy Several popular Pamphlets have also been attributed to her pen  The beauty of Mrs Robinson's poetry has obtained her the dignified appellation of THE ENGLISH SAPPHO She is sometimes feeble and sometimes degenerates into a false taste but the poetic imagery the feeling and tenderness the warmth and elegance and above all the delicacy of expression which breathe through her poems can seldom fail to lay her reader under a bountiful contribution of applause As a novelwriter we think this lady much less successful Her VANCENZA speedily reached a third edition because it was the work of Mrs Robinson but surely in falls greatly short of many of her countrywomen this as well as in her subsequent attempts she in the talent of pleasing Her tragedy The Sicilian  Lover is a very favourable specimen indeed of her talent in that line of composition  ROBINSON MISS ME  Daughter of the subject of the proceeding article and a young lady whose literary talents and accomplishments are said to vie with her personal attractions She published in "The Shrine of Bertha" a novel of some merit in two duodecimo volumes interspersed with some elegant poetry by her mother  ROBINSON REV THOMAS MA  Vicar of St Mary Leicester and formerly Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge He published in Vol I of "Scripture Characters or a practical Improvement of the principal Histories of the Old Testament from Adam to Joshua inclusive" in duodecimo to which he has since added three more volumes and has likewise reprinted the work in four volumes octavo Mr Robinson also printed in "A Serious Exhortation to the Inhabitants of Great Britain with reference to the  approaching  Fast"  ROBINSON POLLINGROVE ESQ  This gentleman published in a poem entitled "The Beauties of Painting" and has since that time written "Handel's Ghost" an ode the Cassina a poem "A Tour

MICHAEL  The author of Love Fragments Sydney St Aubyn a novel and some other small pieces  ROBISON JOHN ESQ MA  Secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh and Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University This gentleman in the early part of his life accompanied the late Admiral Sir Charles Knowles as private secretary when he went to Russia for the purpose of regulating the navy and resided for some time in that capacity at St Petersburgh he has also resided a good deal in Germany Professor  Robison is distinguished for his accurate and extensive knowledge especially on subjects of science He contributed to the Encyclopaedia Britannica the valuable articles Physics Pneumatics Precession of the Equinoxes Projectiles Pumps Resistance of Fluids River Roof Ropemaking Rotation Seamanship Signals Sound SpecificGravity Statics Steam Steamengine Strength of Materials Telescope Tide ArticulatingTrumpet Variation of the Compass and WaterWorks also Philosophy in association with Dr Gleig In the Autumn of the year Professor Robison published an octavo volume entitled "Proofs of a Conspiracy against all the Religions and Governments of Europe carried on in the secret Meetings of Freemasons Illuminati and Reading Societies collected from good Authorities" This volume has been favourably received and although too hasty a performance for a work of so much consequence is well entitled both from its subject and by its authenticity to the serious attention of every reader It arrives at the same remarkable conclusion as the celebrated Memoirs of the Abbé Barruel illustrating the History of Jacobinism though the authors were perfectly unconnected with each other and pursued their enquiries in very different ways It has raised we are sorry for such an appearance a considerable clamour and enmity against the Professor though it was written as we are fully convinced from the best of motives We cannot conclude  this article without observing that the principles and honest zeal which Professor Robison has displayed upon this occasion are highly creditable to him and merit the warmest acknowledgements from society in general We have understood that he designs to favour the world at some time or other with a Life of Sir Isaac Newton a work much wanted from a man of Science and for the due execution of which the Professor is peculiarly wellqualified  ROGERS SAMUEL ESQ  A partner in the Bankinghouse of Messrs Welch and Co and a poet of very considerable distinction He is a son of the Mr Rogers who was the unsuccessful candidate for Coventry in opposition to Colonel Holroyd now Lord Sheffield in the election for that city so celebrated for riot and strenuous contention Mr Rogers has written "The Pleasures of Memory" a poem which has been received with very uncommon applause and is one of the most elegant and charming productions with which the votaries of the Muses have for many years favoured the public This poem made its first appearance in and has been NINE times reprinted in a very elegant duodecimo volume with the addition of a few smaller pieces some of which had appeared before separately and anonymously  ROKEBY LORDSee Robinson  ROSCOE WILLIAM ESQ  Of Liverpool A gentleman who has acquired great and merited renown in the literary world by the masterly manner in which he has of late exhibited to the public the Life and Labours of Lorenzo de' Medici called the Magnificent Mr Roscoe was brought up to the profession of an attorney but does not we believe at present practice in that line The abovementioned work does the highest credit to his literary talents and entitles him to rank with the very first writers on European History The circumstances attending this publication are not among the least singular in the annals of literature The full distinct and accurate idea afforded us with such genius and learning of the interesting subject treated in these volumes is the result of discoveries made in the literature of one of the most polite and learned nations of Europe by a foreigner who had never visited that country By a gentleman who was not courting literature in academical bowers but devoting his time to an active and a laborious profession Mr Clarke a banker of Liverpool and son of the late banker of the same name a gentleman of very extensive  information and the intimate friend of Mr Roscoe had paid a visit to Italy and had fixed his winter residence at Florence It was through the assiduity of this gentleman that Mr Roscoe obtained his large stock of original and interesting information as well as the beautiful Poems of Lorenzo de' Medici with copies of which as well as with beautiful and exact Translations of them he has enriched his work the originals of which are deposited in the Laurentian Library although the former editiors appear not to have had the slightest information respecting them The work made its first appearance in in two volumes quarto under the title "The Life of Lorenzo de' Medici called the Magnificent" Such we have understood was the author's diffidence of its success that the first impression consisted of only two hundred and fifty copies So small a number disappeared very soon after publication and although the work was printed in the expensive style and sold at a proportional price it has seen three editions even in times so unpropitious as the present Nor as every reader can foretel has it obtained early popularity without the prospect of a lasting reputation It holds the place which it fills in the History of Europe by too lawful a tenure ever to renounce its privileges  The celebrated and excellent Letter to Mr Pitt BY JASPER WILSON has been improperly attributed to Mr Roscoe It is the production of  his friend Dr James Currie of Liverpool and we believe that the largest share he had in that publication was a perusal of the original copy and some little assistance he may have given in revising the sheets as they came from the press Mr Roscoe has been engaged for some time we understand upon a Life of Burns the Scotch poet  ROSE GEORGE ESQ MP  Clerk of the Parliaments Joint Secretary to the Treasury and late Master of the PleasOffice This gentleman is a remarkable instance of the power of genius in rescuing its possessor from the obscurity which he shall seem to have inherited by his birth We first hear of him in the capacity of Purser to a man of war a situation from whence he rose by many gradations to his present eminence Mr Rose held the same appointment under the Marquis of Lansdown which he has at present under Mr Pitt He is supposed to have written a pamphlet which was published in the year entitled "The proposed System of Trade with Ireland Explained  ROSE REV W  One of the Masters of Merchant

Sexes of Plants and refuting that gentleman's arguments against that doctrine He is also the author of the articles Oxygen and Phlogiston in the new Encyclopaedia Britannica  ROUGH WILLIAM ESQ  Of Gray's Inn Late of Trinity College Cambridge and formerly of Westminster School We believe this gentleman's first attempts at authorship were some contributions to the Flagellant a miserable periodical paper by the Westminster Scholars which was published in and which reached about eight or nine numbers In Mr Rough published "Lorenzino di Medici and other Poems" in a small duodecimo volume dedicated to Mr Roscoe to whom Mr Rough is wholly unknown but for whose character as an author he thus expresses his great esteem Notwithstanding Mr Rough's hopes that his tragedy has some claim to the honours of a legitimate drama we must beg leave to say of his volume that the dedication is absurd the four first acts of the tragedy woefully dull and the sonnets which follow pretty rather than otherwise He is also the writer of the poetry in the Monthly Magazine signed W R GRAY'SINN Mr Rough has announced his intention of publishing "A comparative View in a Series of Letters of the moral and metaphysical Opinions of Hume  Godwin  and Hartley" on  which occasion we beg leave to repeat the trite maxim of Horace  Sumite materiam vestris qui scribitis aequam  Viribus et versate diu quid ferre recusent  Quid valeant humeri  ROUS GEORGE ESQ  A Veteran in political warfare We believe his first publication was a masterly Letter to the Jurors of Great Britain occasioned by an opinion of the Court of King's Bench read by Lord Chief Justice Mansfield in the case of the King and Woodfall which appeared anonymously in and was reprinted with the sanction of his name in In the year Mr Rous printed a wellwritten tract entitled "A candid Investigation of the present prevailing Topic  Secret Influence  the first edition of which was distributed but not sold and it was

published three years afterward entitled "An Explanation of the mistaken Principle on which the Commutation Act was founded c" These performances in opposition to the measures of administration were supposed to contain the strongest arguments urged on that side of the question  ROUSSEAU SAMUEL  Nephew to the celebrated French writer of the same sirname He was employed by Mr John Nichols to copy the Epitaphs in Islington Church and Churchyard How faithfully he executed this task is evident from the copious enumeration of them which is annexed to the History and Antiquities of Canonburyhouse

is publishing a very beautiful and splendid work in folio entitled "Plants of the Coast of Coromandel" It is a selection from drawings and descriptions presented to the East India Directors and is published by their order under the direction of Sir Joseph Banks This work beside the attention of the celebrated naturalist who superintends it has had the advantage of the collective labours  of three excellent botanists viz of Johne Gerrard Koeing a pupil of Linné who bequeathed his MSS and specimens to Sir Joseph Banks of Dr Russell who succeeded him in the service of the East India Company and who planned the work and lastly of the subject of this article who succeeded Dr Russell and who executes the work with very great ability Three fasciculi of this publication each containing

RUSH BENJAMIN ESQ MD  Professor of the Institutes of Medicine and of Clinical Practice in the University of Pennsylvania and a writer of very great distinction on medical subjects We believe his first publication was a Dissertation on the Spasmodic Asthma of Children which was originally printed in a Pennsyvania newspaper and in in a shilling pamphlet Dr Rush has since that time published an Oration delivered before the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia Feb th an Enquiry into the Effects of public Punishments upon Criminals and upon Society an octavo pamphlet an Account of

octavo volume  RYAN REV EDWARD DD  Prebendary of St Patrick and Minister of the parish of St Luke Dublin This gentleman has written "The History of the Effects of Religion on Mankind" in two octavo volumes the first of which was published in and the second in The tendency of this work is to prove from a direct appeal to historical facts that the actual operation of Christianity on mankind has been highly beneficial and though not unexceptionably it is very respectably executed The praiseworthy exertions of Dr Ryan in support of religion have  been rewarded by academical honours and considerable church preferment  RYLAND REV JOHN DD  A Baptist Minister of Bristol son of the late John Ryland of Northampton He has published several calvinistical Tracts and Sermons  RYMER JAMES

nobleman of great rank at Vienna had been condemned to the mines and that his wife a Lady of high extraction and in the bloom of youth and beauty had taken the desperate resolution of sharing his face and of ac+companying him to those abodes of wretchedness This poem was first published in quarto in and has since that time been reprinted with the addition of two Historic Odes which are not unworthy of Gray in a duodecimo volume The Mine is a successful attempt to unite poety and science Its principal subjects are the wonders of the fossil kingdom and the manner in which it is executed does great honour to the learning and genius of the writer and frequently discovers in him very uncommon powers of expression  SATIS G  Of Clifford's Inn The author of a very complete Introduction to the Knowledge of the French  Language comprized in four distinct octavo volumes viz his edition of Holder's System of French Accidence and Syntax  Thèmes François et Anglois  "Classical Exercises upon the

ESQ MD FRS  Senior Physician to Guy's Hospital This gentleman published in a Translation of Plenck's  Method of giving Mercury in Venereal Cases  and has since that time written an Answer to Geach and

Sayer for his services as counsel on the part of Lord Hood before a Westminster electioncommittee in the year  SAYERS F ESQ MD  We believe the first publication of this gentleman was a quarto tract which appeared in entitled "Dramatic Sketches of the Ancient Northern Mythology" a work very highly to the credit of his taste and his poetic genius Two years afterward he reprinted these Sketches in an octavo  volume with the addition of two Monodramas and several smaller poetical pieces under the title "Poems" Since that time Dr Sayers has published an octavo volume of Disquisitions Metaphysical and Literary a work likewise greatly to the credit of his talents  SCOTT JOHN ESQ  Formerly a Major in the service of the East India Company and also formerly a Member of Parliament He was for some years agent to Mr Hastings when that gentleman was Governorgeneral of Bengal has always been his warm defender and previous to his trial displayed very uncommon diligence and ability in supporting the cause of his absent friend While in this capacity he published several political pamphlets the first of which appeared in under the title "A short Review of the Transactions in Bengal during the last ten years" This was followed by two Letters to Mr Burke in Defence of Mr Hastings a Letter to Mr Fox a Narrative of Transactions in Bengal two Replies to Speeches by Mr Burke and "The Conduct of his Majesty's late Ministers considered as it affected the East India Company and Mr Hastings" published in Several of his Speeches in Parliament also about this time reached the press and innumerable  letters paragraphs puffs and squibs which appeared in the newspapers were attributed to him A very curious bill of the latter to the amount of several hundred pounds was published in by the Editor of the Morning Herald Could perseverance and confidence have gained a cause the triumph of the indefatigable Major would have been complete and accordingly they had their weight while the question respecting Mr Hastings remained in loose and general terms It has however been imputed to Major Scott that notwithstanding the temerity of his zeal he was considerably instrumental in bringing his Principal into the miserable situation which he was so long constrained to endure  The pamphlets which he has written since those already mentioned have been Observations on Mr Sheridan's Comparative Statement of the two India Bills seven Letters on the Regency three Letters to Mr Fox Letters to Dodsley in Refutation of certain Misrepresentations in the Annual Register a Letter to Mr Francis two Letters to G Hardinge Esq a Letter to Mr Burke and Observations on Belsham's Memoirs of the Reign of George III The latest of Major Scott's productions as well as the first is in the cause of his friend Mr Hastings and he very properly asserts that if Mr Belsham aspires to the character of an impartial historian he should studiously revise every passage of his work that is calculated  to convey to posterity an injurious reflection on the conduct and principles of the late Governorgeneral The world knows that they have stood the test of the most rigorous examination  SCOTT JONATHAN ESQ  Captain in the East India Company's Service Persian Secretary to the late Governorgeneral Warren Hastings Esq and Member of the Asiatic Society in Calcutta This gentleman published in in two volumes

together with an Ode to the Sun a BathEaston Prize Poem was published in a quarto pamphlet in In the year following she produced a Monody on her gallant and amiable friend Major Andrè and it is said that Dr Darwin speaking of this poem and the one on Captain Cook used to tell her she was the inventress of Epic Elegy Miss Seward's subsequent productions have been a Poem to the Memory of Lady Miller Louisa a poetical novel an Ode on General Elliot's Return from Gibraltar and "Llangollen Vale with other Poems" published in a quarto pamphlet in  Of these productions perhaps the first in point of popularity is the poetical novel while the one held in highest estimation for poetical value by the fair author herself is we are told the Ode on General Elliot's Return Miss Seward's perpetual study of uncommon and poetical expression has not unfrequently led her into affectation and obscurity yet the general harmony of her numbers her refined sentiment her elegant description and her copious imagery will always insure her many admirers Beside the poems above mentioned she has contributed many original fugitive Pieces and some Translations of Odes of Horace to the Gentleman's Magazine and has announced for speedy publication a collection in quarto to be entitled "Sonnets and Horatian Odes"  SEWARD WILLIAM ESQ  A very successful and judicious Compiler He has published an

Distinction between  Manslaughter and Murder a Declaration of the People's natural Right to a Share in the Legislature a Tract on the Law of Nature and Principles of Action in Man and a pamphlet entitled "The Legal Means of Political Reformation" published in  SHARPE  The son of a Grocer and Confectioner in Fenchurch Street and Member of Pembroke Hall Cambridge A year or two ago he arrogated to himself the title of Editor of Rowley's Poems reprinting those pieces in an octavo volume prefixing Mr Coleridge's beautiful Monody on Chatterton and adding perhaps  a dozen  filly notes The lines of Horace at the end of his Epistle to Augustus can never be more appropriately applied than to this volume  Deferar in victim vendentem thus et odores  Et piper et quidquid chartis amicitur ineptis  SHAW REV WILLIAM  A native of Scotland and a friend of the late Dr Samuel Johnson He published in a Galic and English Dictionary in two volumes  a work of very laborious application and enquiry In the following year Mr Shaw engaged in a controversy respecting the Poems of Ossian and displayed much learning and acuteness in denying their authenticity He published two pamplets upon this occasion and

octavo volumes entitled "Miscellanies" which contained his various productions in verse and prose published separately during the interval One of these a Didactic Poem was particularly admired on its

favourable reception Mr Shepherd has hinted his intention of also favouring the public with an Elucidation of the Litany Communionoffice and other Offices of the Church  SHERIDAN RICHARD BRINSLEY ESQ MP  This celebrated character is of a family which during the greater part of the present century has been eminent for genius and learning His grandfather was the intimate friend and favourite of Doctor Swift the companion of his leisure the sharer of his confidence and the imitator of his wit His father was the corrector of the English accent and was acknowledged to be the best declaimer in the English Language of his day he was for a  considerable time manager of the Dublin Theatre and being compelled by the animosity of party to quit that situation acquired same and profit in London as an actor and as a lecturer The mother of Mr Sheridan could also boast a distinguished literary reputation obtained by several Plays Novels and other Pieces of considerable merit  Mr Sheridan was born at Quilea near Dublin in the year At the age of six years his father then compelled to quit his native country brought him to England and placed him at Harrow School under the care of Dr Sumner who was at that time the headmaster Here Mr Sheridan contracted a friendship with Dr Parr then one of the undermasters which has ever since subsisted between them It does not appear that he was ever a member of either of the Universities but the law being his destination was entered of the Middle Temple At the age of eighteen years he translated from the Greek in association with a friend the Epistles of Aristaenetus and also about that time printed several pieces which are known only to his intimate friends and among which we believe was an Answer to the celebrated Heroic Epistle to Sir William Chambers Residing for some time at Bath he became acquainted with Miss Elizabeth Linley daughter of the late Patentee of Drury Lane of that name This lady celebrated no less in her day for her mental than for her personal accomplishments was highly distinguished  at that time as a public singer and a part of her story very honourable to herself relative to a proposal of marriage is commemorated by Foote under the character of Miss Linnet in his comedy entitled "The Maid of Bath" Not long after this affair Mr Sheridan made honourable proposals to her and was engaged on her account in a duel with a Captain Matthews which was very singular for the courage ferocity and inveterate resentment displayed by the parties In his suit was crowned with success and though his lady brought him little or no fortune it has been supposed that his subsequent figure in the world has been in some degree owing to this marriage He was now in his twentysecond or twentythird year and even at this early period discovered that pride and dignity of mind which though not always desirable companions in the commerce of life are mostly characteristic of a generous spirit and a true genius For notwithstanding his narrow circumstances and the distance at which he was then removed from those brilliant prospects which he afterward had in view he would not allow Mrs Sheridan to engage herself at any place of public entertainment  Depending on his own talents alone for support Mr Sheridan first turned his thoughts to dramatic composition and in January brought out at Covent Garden Theatre his comedy THE RIVALS This piece as it was originally played  nearly doubled in length the generality of theatrical performances It suffered greatly on the first night from the severity of the audience and with difficulty obtained a second hearing Several causes conspired to produce this effect among which in justice to Mr Sheridan must be mentioned the miserable manner in which some of the performers Mr Lee in particular acted their parts Being however new moulded by the author it was received with considerable applause and has continued a favourite with the public This play abounds in character and situation yet though it bears indisputable marks of the fertility of the author's genius it is certainly far from a perfect composition The character of Mrs Malaprop who is distinguished from the ordinary run of illiterate pretenders by the mere circumstance of her pronouncing hard words correctly but using them in an improper sense instead of murdering the words themselves as is usually the case is surely illconceived and unnatural The idea of Acres with his newfangled oaths always swearing by objects appropriate to the subject of which he is treating seems an equal violation of probability and there appears to run through the piece an endeavour to give character and originality which is always built upon affected circumstances and not upon experience and knowledge of human nature When Mr Sheridan published this comedy he acknowldged his youth and inexperience  and adopted the error of dreading imitation asserting in his preface that  on subjects on which the mind has been much informed invention is slow of exerting itself  Yet it has always happened in some degree to those writers who think that the want of information will assist their invention that they have incurred the very censure they were anxious to avoid and have exhibited as new what is stale and hackneyed and what a more intimate acquaintance with their subject would have taught them to reject In this year he also produced St Patrick's Day a farce which was originally represented for the benefit of Mr Clinch who seems to have been favoured with it in consequence or his representation of the Irishman in the Rivals in which he greatly excelled Mr Lee  In the following year Mr Sheridan enriched the English drama with his celebrated comic opera THE DUENNA The success of this piece was beyond all former example The Beggar's Opera which had all the wits and half the nobility of England for its supports ran sixtythree nights in one season the Duenna seventyfive The satire of this piece is beautiful and poignant the flashes of wit are perpetual and always genuine while the songs are characterised by that  onction  that ripeness and mellowness of expression which is probably the grand secret of songwriting This piece did not reach the press by the author's consent till the year  But even the merit of the Duenna was thrown into comparative oblivion on the appearance in the following year of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL No dramatic production ever equalled this celebrated piece in success It can receive no honour from additional praise nor is it likely to be injured by the severest critical examination Character it is true is not the fort even of this greatest production of our author yet the plot is so natural the mirror held up so true the incidents follow with such ease and grace the dialogue is so chaste and lively the wit so brilliant and stirling and every thing is so exquisitely finished and so happily conveyed that our entertainment is unbounded and we can never enough applaud our mirth This piece the policy as we suppose of our earliest theatres being on this occasion revived has never lawfully reached the press though some editions of it have been printed in Ireland from a smuggled copy and sold here  In Mr Sheridan brought out at Drury Lane "The Camp" a dramatic entertainment intended to compliment the Dutchess of Devonshire which has never been printed and in the following year "The Critic or a Tragedy Rehearsed" a farce which  has  reached the press The Critic is distinguished by that genuine wit which has so often characterised the productions of its author and is a piece which has obtained the frequently repeated applauses of the public Its first act has  particular merit in the character of Sir Fretful Plagiary which as is well known is a satire upon Mr Richard Cumberland a gentleman of mild and amiable manners but who is probably in some degree subject to the weakness here ridiculed and who had been so illadvised or so unfortunate as to give offence to Mr Sheridan The two last acts which consist of a mock tragedy have as much merit as their subject will allow under the twofold disadvantage of being barren in itself and of having been anticipated by the popular comedy of the Rehearsal The author of the Rehearsal had the advantage of writing in an aera of false taste and of having for the topic of his ridicule the absurdities of so great a genius as Mr Dryden The errors of more modern tragedies were too evanescent for satire and Mr Sheridan in order to be intelligible was obliged sometimes to have recourse to the best passages of Shakspeare now it is true that our mirth may be excited by a travesty of Homer or Virgil but we never can applaud the author To the pen of Mr Sheridan are also to be attributed "A Trip to Scarborough" a comedy as  altered  from Vanburgh's  Relapse  a Monody to the Memory of Mr Garrick which would have reflected lustre upon an inferior genius but added nothing to our admiration of Mr Sheridan the Prologue to Captain Ayscough's tragedy Semiramis which is a beautiful piece of poetry and several more highly elegant trifles which are to be  found in different collections of fugitive pieces The public has also for many years been flattered with the hopes of receiving from the same source "The Foresters" a comic opera and Affectation a comedy but from the length of their delay we may be led to despair of their appearance  It was in the year when Mr Garrick retired from the stage that Mr Sheridan purchased in association with Mr Linley his fatherinlaw and with Dr Ford one moiety of the property of Drury Lane Theatre to which they soon afterward added the other moiety Mr Sheridan's share of this property is said to have been more than a half and for some years he continued the acting manager of the theatre His carelessness and inattention to the interests of this situation were very conspicuous and the credit of old Drury certainly lost a sturdy prop in her celebrated Garrick But having completed every thing with regard to the stage to which his ambition could aspire Mr Sheridan turned the activity of his mind to another object and was encouraged by the friendship of Mr Fox to offer himself a candidate for representing the town of Stafford in the Parliament which was summoned to meet October th The new life into which his success introduced him exalted his views and by engaging his talents in the concerns of his country has had a fatal effect on his dramatic pursuits Yet it must be acknowledged a remarkable circumstance that a writer should so soon have  reached the highest pinnacle of excellence in a path so arduous of ascent and that he should then have relinquished it for ever  Mr Sheridan did not inherit from nature every advantage toward making him a great public speaker His voice in particular was neither strong harmonious nor of considerable compass He had however the benefit of a remarkably clear and accurate articulation and was early initiated in ideas of public speaking by his father The difficulties under which he laboured were conquered by unwearied perseverance and by the exercise of his voice on trifling topics and ordinary occasions This conquest was not completed when he was appointed in Under Secretary of State in the department of Mr Fox or when in the year following he was promoted to the place of Secretary to the Treasury under the Duke of Portland In the session of he made a celebrated Speech upon the fourth of the twenty Irish Propositions and in the following year upon a motion brought forward by himself upon the subject of finance of the former of these Speeches a tolerable report was published and has been inserted in the Parliamentary Register But Mr Sheridan rose to his greatest height as a speaker in when he opened the third article of impeachment in the House of Commons against Mr Hastings upon the subject of the punishment inflicted by him for the rebellion of the Princesses of Oude This  speech was five hours and a half in length and those who heard it seemed to think that no language could do justice to its wit its sublimity and its pathos It is hardly necessary to add that Mr Sheridan has for many years been one of the most distinguished leaders of the opposition As an elegant scholar we may safely say he has not a superior in the senate of his country and however different the sensations may be with which his character will impress some of those who contemplate him as a genius and as a man the urbanity of his behaviour in that assembly and the uniformly classical elegance and grace of his diction must command the admiration of all  Not many years after the loss of his first wife Mr Sheridan married in Miss Ogle daughter of the Dean of Winchester About this time he attempted to dispose of his property in the theatre but though he sold a part of it he still retains the larger share  SHERIDAN CHARLES FRANCIS ESQ  This gentleman is an elder brother of the subject of the preceeding article and was a few years ago Under Secretary of State for the War Department in the Kingdom of Ireland and also a Member of the Parliament of that Kingdom He published in in an octavo volume a History  of the  late  Revolution in Sweden having been Secretary to the British Envoy in that kingdom at the time of the Revolution This is a very masterly performance Mr Sheridan also wrote several pamphlets which were received with applause upon the ministerial side of the question during the former dissentions of Ireland one of them was entitled "Letters of a Dungannon Volunteer respecting the Expediency of a Parliamentary Reform" In the year Mr Sheridan published in London an Essay upon the true Principles of Civil Liberty and of Free Government occasioned by the levelling doctrines of the day  SHERLOCK REV MARTIN  A native of Ireland and Chaplain to the Right Rev the Earl of Bristol Lord Bishop of Derry During his travels with his patron in he published at Naples  Consiglio ad un Giovane Poeta  which is an ingenious investigation of Italian poetry published with the intention of giving foreigners a more just idea of Shakspeare than could be collected from the strictures of the partial and jealous Voltaire and at Geneva  Lettres d'un Voyageur Anglois  in which the words of Horace  Purpureus late qui splendeat unus et alter  Assuitur pannus  are remarkably exemplified In the following year Mr Sherlock published in London and Paris  Nouvelles Lettres d'un Voyageur Anglois  in an octavo volume Both of these volumes of Letters were afterward translated into English Soon after his return in he published "Letters on several Subjects" in two duodecimo volumes and four years afterward "A Fragment on Shakspeare" extracted from the abovementioned  Advice to a young Poet  As a writer Mr Sherlock seems to have equal shares of ingenuity sprightliness and impertinent vanity  SHILLITO CHARLES  This gentleman published in "The SeaFight" an elegiac poem which he wrote at sea He has since that time published anonymously "The Country Bookclub" a poem "The Man of Enterprize" a farce acted by the Norwich company and a Translation of a Sonnet supposed to have been written by Mary Queen of Scots to the Earl of Bothwell Some of these pieces are not without merit  SIBLY MANOAH  Shorthand writer to the City of London one of Baron Swedenborg's preachers and formerly a teacher of Greek Hebrew c He published in a Critical Essay on Jeremiah xxxiii and has also published twelve Sermons in an octavo volume three Sermons on the question WHO IS THE LORD the Liturgy of the New Church two Sermons on the Call of the Jews Hardy's Trial for High Treason in two volumes octavo and Mr Gibbs' Speech in Defence of Hardy  SIDDONS HENRY ESQ  Son of the celebrated actress of the same name He brought out at the Haymarket Theatre in a farce entitled "Modern Breakfast" which was condemned and afterward published He has also written "William Wallace or The Highland Hero" a novel which was noticed rather for the hereditary honours of its author than for any distinguished merit which it can boast  SIMEON REV CHARLES MA  A Methodist Preacher Fellow of King's College Cambridge He published in in a large octavo volume Claude's Essay on the Composition of a Sermon with an Appendix containing one hundred  Skeletons  of Sermons and has also printed occasional single Sermons preached before the University which have plenty of  flesh  on their bones  SIMES THOMAS ESQ  A Military Officer and author of several Tracts on Military subjects He published in "The Military Medley" in an octavo volume for the benefit of an humane charity in Ireland and has since that time written "A Military Course for the Government and Conduct of a Battallion" an octavo volume "The Military Instructor" a duodecimo volume a Treatise on the Military Science in quarto "The Military Library" in four volumes octavo and "The Military Regulator" an octavo volume  SIMPSON REV DAVID  Author of a work in four volumes octavo published in entitled "Sacred Literature" which is a compilation consisting of a vast variety of quotations from authors of all descriptions who have written concerning the holy scriptures and whose only merit is the marks which it bears of the compiler's industry  SINCLAIR SIR JOHN LLD MP  President of the Board of Agriculture and a distinguished promoter of improvements in that art This Baronet was born in the year and is the only surviving son of the late George Sinclair Esq of Ullester in the county of Caithness North Britain He was educated at the Highschool Edinburgh and at the Universities of Edinburgh Glasgow and Oxford In the year he was chosen Member for Caithness his native county which he represented in two Parliaments and was chosen at the last election for Petersfield Hants Sir John Sinclair is distinguished for his knowledge of Finance Agriculture and Statistics He published in the year "Observations on the Scottish Dialect" designed to remove the distinction which  a different dialect had produced between nations united under the same government and connected by similar customs and laws also "Lucubrations during a short Recess" an anonymous pamphlet and "Thoughts on the Naval Strength of the British Empire" a pamphlet The anonymous pamphlet produced several Answers one in particular by Lord Camelford drawn up with great ability the Pamphlet on our Naval Strength was also answered from the press In the following year Sir John Sinclair wrote a pamphlet entitled "Hints addressed to the Public" on the state of our finances which in opposition to the Earl of Stair among other writers was the first of the publications asserting the ample resources of the nation His subsequent productions have been "The History of the Public Revenue of the British Empire" a very elaborate and interesting work in two volumes quarto of which the first was published in "State of Alterations which may be proposed in the Laws for regulating the Election of Members of Parliament for Shires in Scotland" a pamphlet published in an Address to the Edinburgh Society for the Improvement of British Wool of which Sir John was appointed chairman an Address to the Landed Interest on the Corn Bill "Statistical Account of Scotland" drawn up from the communications of the ministers of the different parishes in twenty volumes octavo of which the two first were published in a work  which redounds very highly to the credit of its author's activity perseverance and public spirit and Letters to the Directors and Governors of the Bank on the pecuniary Distresses of the Country written in  SKINNER REV JOHN  A Presbyter of the Episcopal Church in Scotland at Longside Aberdeenshire He published in the year in two volumes octavo an Ecclesiastical History of Scotland from the first appearance of Christianity in that Kingdom to the time at which

volume an entertaining work  SMITH MRS CHARLOTTE  Of Bignor Park Sussex a lady of very distinguished reputation as a Poet and as a Novelwriter Her first publication was "Elegiac Sonnets and other Essays" which appeared in quarto in These poems characterised by great elegance of feeling and beauty of expression have been very frequently reprinted and with many subsequent additions are now

voluminous French work entitled  "Causes celebreè c"  and in the year following "Emmeline or the Orphan of the Castle" a novel She has since that time written Ethelinde Celestina Desmond the Old Manor

"Rambles Farther" in continuation of the Rural Walks" in two duodecimo volumes and a Narrative of the Loss of the Catherine Venus c near Weymouth drawn up from information taken on the spot and published for the benefit of an unfortunate  survivor from one of the wrecks and her infant child Considered as a novelwriter only though her powers of pleasing are very great Mrs Smith has a few superiors among her countrywomen considered as a poet only the number of these will be found exceedingly small but if considered as to her union of both these characters we know of no lady who has superior pretensions  SMITH JAMES EDWARD ESQ MD FRS  This gentleman is sometimes distinguished by the name LINNAEAN SMITH from possessing the Linnaean library cabinets c He is a very industrious and able writer particularly on subjects of Natural History We believe his first publication was a pamphlet in entitled "Reflections on the Study of Nature" which is a translation of one of the preface's of Linnaeus In the year following he published a Dissertation on the Sexes of Plants translated from the Latin of Linnaeus and three years after that  Reliquiae Rudbeckianae  in a folio volume and the first Fasciculus in folio of  Plantarum Icones hactenus ineditae  a most elegant and learned work intended to give figures of such plants chiefly of the Linnaean Herbarium as have not hitherto been properly represented or of which no description or figure is as yet extant  Three Fasciculi of this publication have made their appearance In Dr Smith published the first Fasciculus in folio of his  Icones Pictae Plantarum Rariorum  a work designed to give accurate and elegant figures with full scientific descriptions of such plants as have hitherto been imperfectly or not at all known and of which no sufficiently good figures exist Another Fasciculus of it has made its appearance Dr Smith's subsequent publications have been a new and improved edition of the  Flora Lapponica  of Linnaeus in an octavo volume Fasciculus I and II of  Spicilegium Botanicum  in small folio a work appropriated to plants of a more humble stature and a Sketch of a Tour on the Continent in the years and in three octavo volumes  SMITH WILLIAM MA  Author of "An Attempt to render the Pronunciation of the English Language more easy to Foreigners" published in an octavo volume in This sensible work is an abridgement of a Dictionary of the English and French Languages upon a plan entirely new shortly to be published by this gentleman  SMITH E ESQ  This gentleman published in "William and Ellen" a tale in verse and has since that time published "The Scaith of France" a poem and also a small collection of his "Poems" He is a respectable versifier  SMYTH JAMES CARMICHAEL ESQ MD FRS  Physician

elegant folio volume entitled "Sketches in Architecture"  SOMERVILLE REV THOMAS DD FRSE  This gentleman published in "The History of Political Transactions and of Parties from the Restoration of King Charles II to the Death of King William" in a quarto volume a work of very considerable merit In the following year he wrote "Observations on the Constitution and  present  State of Britain" a pamphlet and is now publishing by subscription a Complete History of Great Britain during the Reign of Queen Anne in a quarto volume  SOTHEBY W ESQ  Author of a volume of Poems consisting of a Tour through Parts of Wales Sonnets Odes c which was first printed at Bath in and four years afterward elegantly reprinted in London in a royal quarto volume with engravings from drawings taken on the spot The poetry has considerable merit  SOUTHEY ROBERT ESQ  Of the City of Bristol A gentleman whose talent for Poetry has obtained him very distinguished applause in the literary world His first publication was a small volume of Poems in association with Mr Robert Lovell his fellowstudent of Baliol College Oxford which appeared in In the year following he published Joan of Arc an epic Poem in a quarto volume about four hundred lines of which at the beginning of the second book were contributed by his friend Mr Coleridge This performance as originally written in twelve books was finished in six weeks and on its improved plan in ten books was almost entirely recomposed during the time of printing The poetical powers displayed in this poem are of a  very superior kind and notwithstanding a little occasional negligence its merit is such as unquestionably to entitle its author to the name or POET yet Mr Southey at the same time must be said to have done infinite injustice to his extraordinary talents in allowing the fervour of youth to hurry him in such a manner through a work of genius so singulary arduous In Mr Southey published a duodecimo volume of Poems which has been very generally admired and abounds in pieces of exquisite beauty In this year he also published an octavo volume of Letters written during a short residence in Spain and Portugal which abound in information and are highly entertaining  SPENCER W R ESQ  This gentleman was one of the translators of Leonora a tale from the German of Bürger His Translation was published in in a very splendid folio volume with designs by the Right Hon Lady Diana Beauclerc and having the German printed on one side of the paper This tale has been called not unaptly  a sort of bluebeard story for the nursery  That the rage for translating this and similar pieces should have been so great and that they should have occupied the public curiosity so much are certainly by no means flattering testimonies of the taste of the times The production  of Mr Spencer was the most elegant of any of them in point of typography and embellishment and not the least distinguished as to literary merit  STAFFORD REV JOHN DD  A rigid Calvinist He published in "The Scripture Doctrine of Sin and Grace considered in a Series of Sermons" in one volume octavo and has also printed a Funeral Sermon for his Daughter and some other single Discourses  STAIR EARL OFSee Dalrymple  STALKARTT MARMADUKE  A distinguished writer on the science Naval Architecture He published in a very valuable work on the Rudiments and Rules of ShipBuilding in a folio volume entitled "Naval Architecture" and dedicated to his Majesty  STANHOPE CHARLES EARL STANHOPE FRS  Fellow of the Society of Arts and Member of the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia This nobleman formerly Lord Viscount Mahon has applied himself with some success to the studies of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy and has contributed several Papers upon these subjects to the Philosophical Transactions In the year his Lordship published "Considerations on the Means of Preventing Fraudulent Practices on the Gold Coin" a pamphlet which he had written at Geneva two years previously in "Principles of Electricity" in a quarto volume and in "Observations on Mr Pitt's Plan for the Reduction of the National Debt" His Lordship's subsequent publications have been a Letter to Mr Burke in Answer to his Speech on the French Revolution and "The Rights of Juries defended" a pamphlet Previously to the troubles in France his Lordship although ministerial in his politics and united by consanguinity as well as inclination to the Chancellor of the Exchequer displayed considerable independence in his conduct and bore the character of one desirous to promote the public welfare to the best of his judgement Since those appearances his political conduct has  been highly extravagant In he made a motion to acknowledge the French Republic and some of his Speeches have even excited the risibility of his adherents Not long ago in the true levelling spirit his Lordship gave the hand of his daughter Lady Stanhope in marriage to Mr Taylor a surgeon of SevenOaks in Kent  STARKE MISS MARIANNA  The author of the Widow of Malabar a tragedy performed at Mrs Crespigny's private theatre at Camberwell and brought out at Covent Garden in This piece is an imitation from M le Mierre's drama  La Veuve du Malabar  which was once much in vogue at Paris In its present form it has some merit  STAUNTON SIR GEORGE BART LLD FRS  This gentleman was his Majesty's Secretary of Embassy to the Emperor of China and Minister Plenipotentiary in the absence of the Ambassador He was formerly an Apothecary in the country married a Miss Collins daughter of a Printer at Salisbury and has raised himself from obscurity to wealth rank and honours His only appearance  as an author has been in the Account he has published of the Embassy to China This long expected work made its appearance in August in two volumes quarto accompanied by a folio volume of plates under the title "An Authentic Account of the Embassy from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China" Such was the public curiosity that although it was printed in a very expensive style and the impression consisted of a large number of copies every one was subscribed for long before the day of publication An octavo edition of it in three volumes has been published since its first appearance The ACCOUNT was taken chiefly from the papers of Lord Macartney the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Sir Erasmus Gower Commander of the expedition and of other gentlemen in the several departments of the Embassy Though it may be said to contain little additional information respecting China to what was already to be found in the writings of Duhalde Grosier and others who have travelled in that country it must be confessed that Sir George Staunton enjoyed peculiar advantages for describing with accuracy the physical as well as moral state of the vast empire So remarkable an instance of the necessary abilities and opportunities to collect information and of strict authenticity in reporting it as concurred in the case of the gentlemen who accompanied this embassy can very rarely  happen It is true that in these volumes utility is never sacrificed to pleasure nor instruction to amusement Veracity candour and modesty mark them in every page but the author's excess of precaution against egotism superinduces a styptic dryness too often to be lamented It is said that a large sum of money was presented to Sir George Staunton by the East India Company to defray the expence of the drawings and engravings which belong to this work  STEARNES HON SAMUEL MD LLD  Astronomer to his Majesty's Provinces of Quebec and New Drunswick c Author of a very singular and for the most part a very absurd book entitled "The American Oracle" published in an octavo volume in In this work he has given a new and ingenious hypothesis of the Aurora Borealis but his vanity and his poetry are insupporta  able Mr Stearns is one of the props of Animal Magnetism and was a coadjutor to Mr Cue in working magnetic miracles  STEDMAN REV THOMAS MA  Vicar of St Chad's Shrewsbury He has edited a volume of Dr Doddridge's Letters with biographical notes and a volume of Letters from the late Rev Mr Job Orton to a young Clergyman MrStedman He has also printed a single Sermon preached at St Chad's Church January th  STEEVENS GEORGE ESQ  A gentleman of fortune resident at Hampstead and a most distinguished character in the literary world as a very learned and acute Editor of Shakspeare He published in "Twenty of the Plays of Shakspeare" in four octavo volumes A year previously to the appearance of this edition Dr Johnson had published an edition of Shakspeare's Plays with Notes in eight octavo volumes A coalition between these two editors having been negociated the edition of Shakspeare commonly called Johnson's and Steevens' Edition made its appearance in ten octavo volumes in It was reprinted by these gentlemen in the same number of volumes five years afterward and again in under the care of Mr Reed who undertook  the office of editor at the request of Mr Steevens The fourth edition of this work with great additions and improvements was published by Mr Steevens in in fifteen octavo volumes In its present form this is by far the most complete edition of Shakspeare extant The diligent editor has taken every possible pains to render his work full clear and convenient and such are the utility and excellence of the prolegomena and notes such also the elegance of the typograpical execution that we may say our immortal bard is edited in a manner becoming his fame  STEVENSON JOHN HALL ESQ  A Versifier of considerable genius and humour He has written Crazy Tales for grown Gentlemen Lyric Epistles Pastoral Cordials Macarony Fables c His works have been lately collected and published with notes in three small octavo volumes  STEWART DUGALD FRSE  Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh This gentleman published in "Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind" in a quarto volume a work highly to  the credit of his abilities He also edited in the late Dr Adam Smith's posthumous Essays on Philosophical Subjects in a quarto volume prefixing an Account of the author's Life and Writings  STILLINGFLEET REV EDWARD MA  Chaplain to the Earl of Dartmouth and formerly Minister of West Bromwich  ordshire He published in a volume of Sermons on some of the principal Doctrines of the Christian Religion which are plain and sensible  STOCKDALE REV PERCIVAL  Rector of Lesborough and Long Houghton in Northumberland A veteran of the press He was formerly in the army and commenced his literary career in the character of a poet publishing in "Churchill defended" a poem and "The Constituents" a poem In he published a Translation of Tesso's  Amyntas  and two years afterward he translated for the booksellers Bos' Antiquities of Greece and Sabbathier's Institutions c of the Ancient Nations Mr Stockdale has since that time published the Works and Life of Waller in a duodecimo volume three Discourses against Luxury c six Discourses in  an octavo volume a single Sermon on Selfknowledge a volume of Sermons dedicated to Mr Pitt eight Sermons on different subjects dedicated to Mr Jerningham a volume of Sermons to Seamen preached on board the Leander an Enquiry into the Nature and genuine Laws of Poetry a duodecimo volume of Miscellanies in Prose and Verse an Essay on Education an Essay on Misanthropy "Three Poems" viz Siddons an Epistle to Sir Ashton Lever and an Essay on an Officer Ximenes a tragedy a Letter to Granville Sharpe Esq respecting the Negroes Poetical Thoughts and Views on the Banks of the Wear Letters to the Bishop of Durham relative to the Living of Hartburn Observations on modern Reformers a Letter to Mr Bryan Letters to the Reviewers and a very angry Letter to a Gentleman of the Philanthopic Society He is also the editor of Oram's Poems  The life of Mr Percival Stockdale has been marked by various misfortunes and discouraging circumstances As a writer he has never been popular and his miscarriage has been somewhat unfortunate He seems to labour under an extreme irritability of the nervous system which has never allowed him to endure the rebukes of honest criticism He is paradoxical without being ingenious he is new without the power of invention and he possesses the true poetic melancholy without one spark of poetic fire  STOKES ANTHONY ESQ  Barrister at Law He published in a View of the Constitution of the British Colonies in North America and the West Indies at the time the Civil War broke out on the Continent of America in an octavo volume Of those parts of the globe Mr Stokes had acquired considerable knowledge by personal residence and he has produced a very judicious and intelligent volume In he wrote a sensible pamphlet entitled "Desultory Observations" on the situation extent government c of Great Britain occasionally contrasted with those of other countries in order to point out the blessings which the English enjoy above all other nations  STONE REV FRANCIS MA FSA  Rector of ColdNorton Essex and a distinguished Reformer Being then Chairman of the Society of the Petitioning Clergy he published in "A new easy and expeditious Method of Discharging the National Debt" in which he very absurdly substituted buffoonery for the discretion and gravity which would have become him in that situation In he wrote "Political Reformation  on a Large Scale" a pamphlet in which he threatened to relinquish his native soi  and to seek an asylum in Ireland with Messrs Grattan Corry c This design he unfortunately laid aside and wrote in an Examination of Mr Burke's REFLECTIONS and also a superficial pamphlet entitled "Thoughts in favour of the Abolition of the Slave Trade"  STRATFORD EDWARD EARL OF ALDBOROUGH IN THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND F R S  A nobleman distinguished for his eccentricities His Lordship has been called THE STANHOPE OF IRELAND He published in an Essay on the true Interests and Resources of the Empire of the King of Great Britain and Ireland  STREET REV STEPHEN MA  Of Queen's College Oxford and Rector of Teyford in Sussex This gentleman published in a new literal Version of the Book of Psalms with Notes in two volumes octavo The design of this work is to elucidate what is obscure to amend what is mistaken and to improve what is  defective and the execution is by no means unworthy of the laudable attempt  STRETCH REV LM MA  Vicar of Twyford and Owslebury and formerly a schoolmaster at Twickenham He published in "The Beauties of History" in two duodecimo volumes designed for youth This compilation has been favourably received but though the plan is good the execution of it is certainly not such as might have been displayed on such a subject Mr Stretch has also published the Substance of two Discourses preached at Winchester Assizes in  STUART CHARLES  A dramatic writer and a friend of the late Mr George Colman He has written the Cobler of Castlebury Ripe Fruit Damnation Gretna Green the Distressed Baronet the Stoneeater and the Irishman in Spain The last of these is a mutilation of a farce called  She would be a Dutchess  which was stopped by the Lord Chamberlain at the request of General Gunning All of these pieces are farces or interludes which were brought out at the Haymarket Theatre Mr Stuart is also the author of a few Prologues and Epilogues  STUART PETER  Brother to the subject of the preceeding article He was formerly concerned in the printing and conduct of the Morning Post and is now the Printer and Editor of the paper called the Oracle which was originally set on foot by Mr John Bell  STURGES REV JOHN LLD  Chancellor of the Diocese of Winchester and Chaplain in Ordinary to his Majesty This gentleman's first publication was a Consecration Sermon printed in Two years afterward he published "Considerations on the State of the Church Establishment" in an octavo volume This book was in reply to the Lectures on Nonconformity of the late Mr Robert Robinson and the manner in which it is written places its author in a most creditable light both as a sensible and as a moderate man In Dr Sturges wrote "Short Remarks" on Dodson's Translation of Isaiah which were answered by Mr Dodson and produced very favourable testimonies to the learning of the Doctor and to the candour of his adversary The subsequent literary productions of Dr Sturges have been a volume of excellent Discourses chiefly on the Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion  and an elegant single Sermon preached in Lambeth Chapel December d at the Consecration of the late Dr Buller Bishop of Exeter  SULIVAN RICHARD JOSEPH ESQ FRAS  This gentleman was Member for New Romney in the last Parliament and has we believe spent part of his life in India His first publication was "A Tour through Parts of England Scotland and Wales" in a series of Letters which appeared in in two volumes octavo Not long after this he published a Letter to the East India Directors an Analysis of the Political History of India in an octavo volume Thoughts on Martial Law a pamphlet and Philosophical Rhapsodies Fragments of Akbur of Betlis containing Reflections on the Laws Manners Customs and Religions of certain Asiatic Afric and European Nations" in three octavo volumes The last of these works though said to be written by a native of Assyria was soon found to be much more deeply tinctured with European than with Oriental Philosophy In Mr Sulivan published "A View of Nature in Letters to a Traveller among the Alps" in six volumes octavo a work whose title attracted a degree of curiosity which its contents were but ill able to gratify The author of THE  PURSUITS OF LITERATURE has thought it proper to dignify this publication with the character of  a work of labour and of general utility digested from original writers with judgement and with an upright virtuous heart in a pleasing and instructive manner  a sentence unworthy of him who passed it To the goodness of the writer's heart we have nothing to object but surely as a philosopher he is even below mediocrity Had not the name of a gentleman and a man of fortuné appeared in the title we should have pronounced the work an arrant instance of bookmaking As it is we can only allow the  last  volume to be at all worthy of a philosophical pen the remaining five are trash the babblings of an infant in natural knowledge Among many to notice  one  particular instance a writer who adopts such a Theory of the Tides as Mr Sulivan has adopted can either not understand Newton's theory and therefore must be totally unequal to such a work as  The View of Nature  or if he does understand it shews by the choice he has made that he is utterly incompetent to his undertaking in point of philosophical reasoning and judgement How trite yet how little heeded is the good old maxim  Sumite materiam vestris qui scribitis aequam  Viribus et versate diu quid ferre recusent  Quid valeant humeri  SULLIVAN JOHN ESQ  Soninlaw to the Earl of Buckinghamshire and Member for Old Sarum in the last Parliament This gentleman published in an elegant octavo volume of "Tracts upon India" written in the years and a work which contains much instructive matter  SWAINSON ISAAC  Proprietor and Vender of De Velnos' Vegetable Syrup Several Pamphlets have been written in the course of the last ten years under his name in assertion of the superior excellence of this medicine particularly a late severe attack on Dr Beddoes under the title "Mercury Stark Naked" These pamphlets have been attributed to the pen of Mr David Williams  SWINBURNE HENRY ESQ  This celebrated traveller is the youngest son of the late Sir John Swinburne Bart of Capheaton in Northumberland the longestablished seat of that ancient Roman Catholic family He was educated  at Scorton School in Yorkshire and afterward studied at Paris Bourdeaux and the Royal Academy at Turin After this he made the usual tour of Italy and in travelled with his lady on the Continent for the express purpose of indulging their taste for antiquities and the fine arts Mr Swinburne spent six years in France Spain Italy and Germany during which time he formed an intimacy with some of the most celebrated literati of those countries and received some signal marks of esteem from the Sovereigns of the courts he visited On his return to England he retired to his seat at Hamsterly in the Bishoprick of Durham which has been his place of chief residence since that time The first of Mr Swinburne's publications was his quarto volume of Travels through Spain which appeared in Four years afterward he published Vol I in quarto of his celebrated Travels in the two Sicilies to which Vol II was added two years afterward Both of these works have been reprinted in octavo the first in two and the last in four volumes The learning and ingenuity of Mr Swinburne are too well known to require an additional panegyric from us The warmth and animation of his descriptions discover an imagination highly susceptible to every beauty of nature or of art and if he have a fault it is that he is too apt to relinquish simplicity for profusion of ornament  SWINTON ANDREW ESQ  Author of an octavo volume of Travels into Norway Denmark and Russia published in This work engaged its author in a legal contest with the proprietors of the Critical Review It contains much amusement and information  SWINTON JOHN ESQ  Advocate He has published an Abridgement of the Public Statutes in Force and Use relative to Scotland from the Union in the fifth year of Anne to the twentyseventh George III inclusive in two volumes quarto which is a considerable enlargement of a work published about by his relation and namesake  SYMMONS REV CHARLES BD  Rector of Narberth in the county of Pembroke and formerly of ClareHall Cambridge He published in a volume of Sermons which do him great credit and which have been favourably received Mr Symmons has also printed two single Sermons  SYMMONS REV CHARLES DD  Of Jesus College Oxford Author of Inez a dramatic poem published in  SYMONDS JOHN ESQ LLD  Of Bury St Edmund's Suffolk The learned Professor of Modern History in the University of Cambridge and Member of Trinity College He was elected to the above Professorship in the year and published in "Remarks upon an Essay entitled  The History of the Colonization of the Free States of Antiquity applied to the Contest between Great Britain and her American Colonies"  a pamphlet In he published "Observations upon the Expediency of revising the present English Version of the four Gospels and of the Acts of the Apostles" in a quarto pamphlet which was followed in by similar "Observations respecting the Epistles in the New Testament" Of these OBSERVATIONS which display uncommon industry and abilities the first was answered in an illiberal anonymous pamphlet entitled  An Apology for the Liturgy of the Church of England  said to be the joint production of two Bishops and prefixed to the last was an able rejoinder by Dr Symonds  As a Lecturer in Modern History the fame of this gentleman is supremely great  T  TAPLIN WILLIAM  SURGEON and in his own words Equestrian Physician He published in Vol I in octavo of "The Gentleman's Stable Directory" to which he has added another volume and in "A Compendium of Practical and Experimental Farriery" in an octavo volume These books have been favourably received and notwithstanding their author's pompous manner illcalculated to inform  stabularian  practitioners are likely to be of great general utility  TAPRELL REV RICHARD  Of South Molton Author of several pious sensible and useful little publications He wrote in a plain Discourse for Children particularly intended to benefit the Sundayschools and "Meditations" chiefly for Women in  Pregnant Circumstances His subsequent publications have been "Serious Advice to Young People" Lectures on the Lord's Prayer in an octavo volume "A Seasonable Publication" a political pamphlet published in and two single Sermons  TARLETON BANASTRE ESQ MP  A Majorgeneral in the Army and a character of greater celebrity in the memoirs of the turf than in the noiseless tenor of these peaceful pages He published in the year in a quarto volume a History of the Campaigns of and in the Southern Provinces of North America in which he was Commandant of the British Legion This work does him credit as an officer but was thought amenable on account of certain disrespectful insinuations which it contains concerning Lord Cornwallis vide our article Roderick Mackenzie  TASKER REV WILLIAM  Of Exeter This gentleman completed in a collection of "Select Odes and Miscellaneous Poems" in three duodecimo volumes many of which had appeared singly at different  times several years before that period The first of them an Ode to the Warlike Genius of Great Britain was printed in and has gained its author considerable credit Had Mr Tasker duly estimated his talents he would have confined himself to excursions like this for mediocrity is the highest station to which any dissimilar poetical attempts of his can be said to have attained Since the abovementioned collection he has published Arviragus a tragedy never performed whose subject is the contest between the ancient Britons and the Romans terminated by the marriage of Arviragus with the daughter of the Emperor Claudius To his "Select Odes" is added a series of Letters containing much miscellaneous matter and among the rest proofs of the anatomical accuracy of Homer in his description of the wounds suffered by the heroes in the Illiad Mr Tasker is at present employed as we understand on a History of Physiognomy from the time of Aristotle to that of Lavater in which the Stagyrite's knowledge of physiognomy is to be illustrated in the same manner as the anatomical knowledge of the venerable Bard in these Letters  TASSIE JAMES  A most ingenious Modeller of Leicestersquare celebrated for his grand collection of engraved  gems He published in a Descriptive Catalogue of his Gems arranged and described by Mr R E Raspe in two volumes quarto  TATHAM REV EDWARD DD  Rector of Lincoln College Oxford A gentleman of distinguished abilities and attainments but by no means a very attractive writer He published in a strange "Essay on  Journal  Poetry" in a volume of Discourses Introductory to the Study of Divinity and in Vol I in octavo of "The Chart and Scale of Truth" in continuation of which a second volume was soon afterward published Dr Tatham has also printed some single Sermons Letters to Mr Burke on Politics a pamphlet a Letter to Mr Pitt on the National Debt and a second Letter to the same on a National Bank "The Chart and Scale of Truth by which to find the Cause of Error" indisputably the masterpiece of its author was read before the University of Oxford at the Lecture founded by Mr Bampton and is not completed in the two volumes already published It is a work highly creditable to the learning and accurate reasoning of its author who appears to have written it with a laudable zeal for academical reformation and for the general advancement of knowledge Its leading object is to assist the philosophical  enquirer in distinguishing what he can know from what he cannot know and by marking the modes and degrees of human knowledge to furnish a general scale or common measure by which we may ascertain the particular nature and relative force of every kind of TRUTH It is calculated in short to lead men to think and to judge for themselves and not in the thoughts and opinions of others If this book can be said to have a fault it seems to be that it is without that finish and polish which to so important a design appear peculiarly requisite  TATTERSALL REV WD MA  Vicar of Wotton under Edge Gloucestershire and Chaplain to the Hon Mr Justice Buller A gentleman of high respectability of character He published in "A Version or Paraphrase of the Psalms" originally written by Mr Merrick divided into stanzas and adapted to the purposes of public or private devotion which he entertains hopes may at some future time obtain a proper sanction for its introduction into the Church Some copies of this work were printed in a larger size and presented to the dignified clergy Mr Tatterfall is also collecting a number of tunes which after submitting them to the best judges of music he designs to publish in addition to the abovementioned work  A year or two previously to these Psalms we believe  this  gentleman published a single Sermon  TAYLOR THOMAS ESQ  Of Walworth This gentleman has been properly called the wouldbe Restorer of unintelligible Mysticism and superstitious Pagan Nonsense He is a most enthusiastic admirer of the Platonic school and has for several years past occasionally astonished the Public with some strange production or other In he published a Translation of the Mystical Hymns of Orpheus in an octavo volume and also a paraphrased Translation of Plotitinus CONCERNING THE BEAUTIFUL Since that time he has published a Translation of Proclus' Commentaries on the first Book of Euclid's Elements a Dissertation on the Eleusinian and Bacchic Mysteries a Translation of the Cratylus Phaedo Parmenides and Timaeus of Plato Sallust on the Gods and the World c a Translation of Apuleius' Fable of Cupid and Psyche and a Translation of Pausanias' Description of Greece with Notes in three volumes octavo He has also announced his intention of giving a complete Translation of Plato's Works Mr Taylor has a very respectable share of learning and is no less indefatigable than he is whimsical  TAYLOR DANIEL  A bookseller and a dissenting preacher He has published several single Sermons beside some other small Theological Pieces and also an Essay on the Truth and Inspiration of the Scriptures "The Consistent Christian" the substance of five sermons and Memoirs of the late Rev W Thompson of Boston Lincolnshire with a Discourse occasioned by his Death  TAYLOR ESQ  Occulist

written many Charades Anagrams Rebuses and Acrostics a Selection of which may be seen in Mr Debrett's Foundling Hospital for Wit  TEMPLE REV ANTHONY MA  Master of the Grammar School at Richmond Yorkshire and Vicar of Easby This gentleman published in "The Written Word the only Rule of Christian Faith and Manners" a pious and sensible tract consisting of three discourses Some years afterward he wrote Remarks on Dr Burgh's Scriptural Confutation and also some highly judicious Letters to Dr Randolph formerly President of Corpus Christi College Oxford in reply to his Animadversions on those Remarks In Mr Temple printed a single Sermon  TEMPLE RICHARD ESQ MD  Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians London He published in an octavo volume entitled "Practice of Physic" which is a useful compendium for young practitioners upon the arrangement of Cullen's Nosology  TENCH WATKIN ESQ  Major of Marines He published in a Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay for  the Conveyance of Convicts an octavo pamphlet and has since that time written a complete Account of the Settlement of Port Jackson in New South Wales The latter of these productions takes up the history of the Settlement where the former drops it and brings it down to the end of the year when Major Tench left the place He has contributed largely by his inland travels to the knowledge which we have of the country about Port Jackson but he is perhaps amenable on the score of exhibiting the dark side of the picture An octavo volume of highly interesting Letters written by Major Tench in France to a Friend in London was published in While he was of his Majesty's ship Alexander that vessel was captured by a French squadron and these Letters were written between November and May The air of truth and manliness which pervades them and the entertaining manner in which they are written characterise them as peculiarly pleasing  THELWALL JOHN  This conspicuous character after a very inferior education was articled to an attorney and early in life exhibited that restless unsatisfied turbulent disposition by which he has of late peculiarly distinguished himself Upon the publication  of Paine's "Rights of Man" Mr Thelwall was one of the first to display a zealous attachment to his principles and he soon afterward began to deliver a course of Lectures of an inflammatory tendency at Beaufort Buildings in the Strand Here evening after evening he thundered out philippics against the Constitution of his country with the vehemence of an impassioned demagogue to the admiration of the vilest refuse of the metropolis In the year these Discourses were interrupted by the hand of Government and the orator was conveyed to the Tower to take his trial together with Hardy Tooke and some other unruly citizens During his confinement Mr Thelwall wrote some Poems which were published after his release Having been tried at the Sessions House Old Bailey in November and acquitted with the other prisoners his subsequent behaviour has been no less marked by its mischievous tendency than it was previously to his imprisonment Under the semblance of illustrating Ancient History he has continued his political Lectures and has transferred his pernicious school to different parts of the country At Yarmouth he was some time ago interrupted in a very serious manner in the midst of his oratory by the abrupt entrance of a body of sailors who were heated with liquor and who actuated by an imiprudent zeal committed several unjustifiable acts  of violence upon the auditory He also experienced some riotous opposition at Lynn and at Wisbeach  As an author Mr Thelwall made his first appearance in when he published Orlando and Almeyda a legendary tale in the manner of Goldsmith and also "Poems on various Subjects" in two duodecimo volumes The touching simplicity which is characteristic of true poetry is in these wretched pieces supplied by a plain prosaic diction which is as remote as possible from it After this unfortunate attempt Mr Thelwall did not seek the press again till the year when No I of his Political Lectures made its appearance In the following year he published "The Natural and Constitutional Right of Britons to Annual Parliaments Universal Suffrage and the Freedom of Popular Association" the Speech which he intended to have delivered on his trial His subsequent productions have been "Sober Reflections on the Seditious and Inflammatory Letter of the Rt Hon Edmund Burke to a Noble Lord" "Strike but Hear" a pamphlet an Appeal to Popular Opinion respecting the Proceedings at Yarmouth "The Rights of Nature against the Usurpations of Establishments" in two parts a particular Account of the Outrages at Lynn and Wisbeach "Democracy Vindicated" consisting of Walter Moylè's Essay on the Constitution and Government of the Roman State with a Preface and Notes by Mr Thelwall "The Retort Courteous to Master  Burke" and the Peripatetic in three volumes duodecimo His writings abound in commonplace observations and sometimes in most offensive petulant scurrility  THOMAS REV AG  Rector of Woolwich and nephew to the late Bishop of Rochester He is the editor of the Works of Bishop Thomas in two volumes octavo to which he has prefixed Memoirs of his Life  THOMPSON SIR BENJAMIN KNT COUNT OF RUMFORD  Knight of the orders of the White Eagle and St Stanislaus c and Fellow of many foreign Societies This ingenious Philosopher and Experimenter is a native of the town of Rumford in the Province of Massachusets During the late war between the Colonies and the mother Country he raised a regiment of American Dragoons and signalised himself on many occasions during the heat of that contest In by his Majesty's permission he engaged himself in the service of his Serene Highness the Elector Palatine Reigning Duke of Bavaria and was employed in various public services particularly in arranging his military affairs  and in introducing a new system of order dicipline and oeconomy among his troops He also formed establishments for the relief of the poor at Munich furnished them with employment suggested many plans for providing them with food at small expence and by various experiments enabled them to abridge their consumption of fuel In pursuing these enquiries he made some valuable discoveries in the construction of Chimneys and was enabled to point out means which have since been successfully put in practice in this country also of increasing the heat and at the same time decreasing the quantity of fuel Count Rumford moreover introduced manufactures into Munich until then unknown and was the mean of familiarizing the use of the Potatoe in Germany The honours which he has received from his new master the Elector are of the highest distinction  The publications of Count Rumford have been confined to his Experimental Essays Political Oeconomical and Philosophical seven of which have been published in octavo pamphlets They have been very generally read and breathe in every page the benevolent and philosophic spirit of their author  THOMSON WILLIAM LLD  Formerly a Clergyman of the Church of Scotland and at present a resident of the Metropolis This gentleman wrote the continuation of Dr Robert Watson's History of Philip III of Spain which was left unfinished by its author He was also the real editor of the Commentary on the Bible which was published under the names Herries and is understood to have been concerned in the original institution of the English Review and to have written the Review of Politics which was subjoined to each number Dr Thomson has also published "The Man in the Moon" a political and philosophical romance in two volumes duodecimo a Translation of the History of Great Britain from the Revolution to the Accession of George I written in Latin by Mr Alexander Cunningham in two volumes quarto an Appeal to the People of England and Scotland in behalf of Mr Hastings Memoirs of the War in Asia in two volumes octavo which was also intended to vindicate the late Governorgeneral and "Mammuth or Human Nature displayed on a grand Scale" in two duodecimo volumes Dr Thomson is a friend of Dr Parr and assisted him with some Observations inserted in the sequel to a Paper circulated by the Rev Charles Curtis As an author he  unites great vigour of invention great depth of observation and great eloquence of expression with remarkable negligence of composition It has been happily said of him that he can be romantic without extravagance and eccentric without absurdity  THOMSON REV GEORGE  Author of an octavo volume entitled "The Spirit of General History" in a series of Letters from the eighth to the the eighteenth century first published in This useful performance was honoured with a long list of subscribers  THOMSON ALEXANDER ESQ  This gentleman published in in an octavo volume "Whist" a poem which possesses considerable merit He has since that time written an ingenious Essay on Novels "The Paradise of Taste" a poem and "The German Miscellany" consisting of translations of dramas dialogues tales and novels Mr Thomson as a writer possesses no mean talents in the art of pleasing but he cannot be said to rank in the first class in point of strength elegance and taste  THOMSON J ESQ  An Officer in the Army and a very sensible and wellinformed writer He has published Translations from the French of M de Pauw's Philosophical Dissertations on the Greeks and on the Egyptians and Chinese each in two volumes octavo and was also we believe the translator of D'Antoni's Treatises on Gunpowder Firearms and the Service of Artillery in Time of War  THOMSON ALEXANDER ESQ MD  This gentleman published in in an octavo volume a Translation of Suetonius' Lives of the first twelve Caesars with annotations and a Review of the Government and Literature of the different Periods Nearly all the Latin classical authors having flourished in the period which form the subject of Suetonius' History this translation was judiciously chosen as a vehicle for an examination of the State of Literature among the Romans and Dr Thomson has executed his undertaking in a manner worthy of a scholar We believe  this  gentleman published in an Enquiry into the Nature Causes and Method of Cure of Nervous Disorders in a Letter to a friend  THORNTON JOHN ROBERT ESQ MD  Late of Trinity College Cambridge An eminent Botanist and Physician He has published "A new Illustration of the Sexual System of Linnaeus" a splendid work and also "Medical Extracts" in four octavo volumes  THORP REV ROBERT DD  Archdeacon of Northumberland Rector of Gateshead and formerly Fellow of St Peter's College Cambridge This gentleman published in Vol I in quarto of an English Translation of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia with a Commentary comprehending Book I of that work Owing as we suppose to a want of encouragement this undertaking has never been prosecuted farther The part which Dr Thorp has committed to the public cannot be said to be a very favourable specimen of his appropriate talents for such an undertaking His Commentary is for the most part a translation of the Notes by the Jesuits and in the management of fluxions a deficiency of knowledge and of address is apparent throughout Beside this publication Dr Thorp has printed two single Sermons one preached at the  Assizes at Newcastle in and the other before the University of Cambridge in  THROSBY JOHN  An intelligent Antiquarian who has devoted his particular enquiries to the Town and County of Leicester He published in "Memoirs of the Town and County of Leicester" in six duodecimo volumes and has since that time produced "Select Views in Leicestershire" from original Drawings in two volumes quarto a Letter to the Earl of Leicester on the Discovery of the Roman Cloaca or sewer at Leicester and the History and Antiquities of the Town of Leicester in a quarto volume Mr Throsby has a good deal of industry but not much taste  TIDD WILLIAM ESQ  Of the Inner Temple Author of "The Practice of the Court of King's Bench in personal Actions" in two volumes octavo of which the first was published in and the second four years afterward This wellexecuted work is to consist three parts the first and second of which are comprehended in the above volumes Mr Tidd has also published a pertinent pamphlet on the  Law of Costs in civil Actions which was afterward reprinted in Part II of his "Practice"  TIERNEY GEORGE ESQ MP  Author of three pamphlets viz "The Real Situation of the East India Company considered" published in two Letters to Mr Dundas and Mr Hobart respecting the Colchester Petition published in and a Letter to Mr Dundas on Mr Anderson's Statement of the Affairs of the East India Company published the year following Mr Tierney was voted in upon petition as Member for the Borough of Southwark the election of Mr Thellusson his successful opponent at the general election in having been made void on account of his violation of the Statute of seventh William III Cap He is become a conspicuous member of the opposition  TINDAL REV WILLIAM MA  Rector of Billingford in Norfolk This gentleman published in "Juvenile Excursions in Literature and Criticism" a duodecimo volume which does him considerable credit as a polite scholar He has since that time written "Plain Truth in a Plain Dress" a sixpenny pamphlet  and the History and Antiquities of the Abbey and Borough of Evesham compiled chiefly from MSS in the British Museum a quarto volume of great merit  TODD REV HENRY JOHN MA  Minor Canon of Canterbury and author of an octavo volume containing some Account of the Deans of Canterbury from the new Foundation of that Church by Henry VIII to the  present  time a curious work  TOMKINS CHARLES  Author of "A Tour to the Isle of Wight" illustrated with eighty views drawn and engraved in aquatinta in two large octavo volumes published in a very splendid publication  TOMLINS T E ESQ  Barrister at Law Editor of Jacob's Law Dictionary in two volumes quarto and author of a pamphlet in Explanation of the Law of Wills and Codicils published in  Repertorium Juridicum  a general Index to the Cases and Pleadings  in Law and Equity contained in all the Reports Yearbooks c published in in folio and Rules of Evidence before Election Committees an octavo volume  TOOKE JOHN HORNE ESQ  This celebrated character was formerly while he bore the sirname of Horne a member of St John's College Cambridge and afterward a Clergyman of Brentford in Middlesex He took a very active part in the election canvas of Mr Wilkes at the memorable period of and was deeply concerned with Messrs Glynn Sawbridge Oliver Townsend Bellas Vaughan c in the subsequent measures for the support of Mr Wilkes' cause and in the institution of the Society of the Bill of Rights An accusation having been brought against Mr Wilkes that he strove to engross the whole subscription money of this society to himself and that he would not permit the other sufferers in the cause of liberty to share in its benefits Mr Horne together with many others deserted his political leader and a newspaper controversy soon afterward broke out between these two gentleman in which they very liberally accused each other of roguery and swindling about an  important  affair of a Welch poney and a packet of foul linen Mr Horne also entered the lists with the celebrated JUNIUS a contest  in which the political divine is commonly thought to have come off secondbest While Minister of New Brentford he published in the year a single Sermon on the precarious tenure of human friendship and in the year following an Oration which he delivered at a numerous Meeting of the Freeholders of Middlesex at Mileend Assembly Room March th to consider of an Address Remonstrance and Petition to his Majesty It is probable that the manner in which he had embroiled himself in political dispute and the conspicuous and improper part which he had acted were his inducements to the resignation of his gown Since that time he has made himself a most conspicuous champion of republicanism In the year he was tried for a libel in having charged the King's troops with murdering the American soldiery at Lexington and Bunker's Hill He subpoenaed Lord George Sackville and several of the King's Ministers who did not think it proper to answer his summons and having undertaken to plead his own cause he delivered a speech three hours in length full of ingenuity argument and shrewdness This speech printed in the State Trials is highly creditable to his talents as a constitutional lawyer  Mr Horne was at this time preparing himself for the bar but objections were raised to exclude him from the profession he had chosen and in several attempts which he made to address his old audiences of freeholders and others he was constantly  overborne and silenced The native energy of his mind enabled him to find a consolation amid these disappointments in the pursuits of literature and having applied himself to the study of Universal Grammar the first fruit of his labour appeared in a Letter to Mr John Dunning Lord Ashburton published in This pamphlet now become very scarce is the skeleton of his subsequent celebrated work on this subject to be noticed hereafter and it is said Dr Johnson thought so well of it that he told a friend if he ever printed a new edition of his dictionary he should adopt many of Mr Horne's etymologies of the conjunctions Five years after this he published a Letter to Lord Ashburton on Parliamentary Reform which was reprinted by Ridgway in Mr Horne assumed the sirname of Tooke in the year in consequence of the will of Andrew Tooke Esq a gentleman who bequeathed him an estate and in he published celebrated etymological work entitled  or Diversions of Purley in an octavo volume These WINGED WORDS obtained the above title from Purley near Croydon at that time the residence of the author and formerly the seat of President Bradshaw In this work Mr Tooke has pointed out and has himself proceeded far in a path before untrodden and evidently leading to improvements by which the science of grammar may be established on a sure basis It has been highly admired and is conceived by the generality of its readers  to have totally demolished the system of Mr James Harris of Salisbury who had long shared in profusion the compliments of the literari A continuation of his grammatical researches has been promised to the world and we have understood that "The Diversions of Purley" are reprinting in quarto In the year Mr Tooke published an extraordinary Letter in defence of Mrs Fitzherbert under the idea of her being the lawful consort of the Prince of Wales and in the year following "Two pair of Portraits" a pamphlet exhibiting in the painter's own style the late Lords Chatham and Holland and their sons Messrs Pitt and Fox  Mr Tooke distinguished himself some years ago as the strenuous partisan of Lord Hood in the Westminster Election In an action of debt founded on the statute Geo III c was brought against him by Mr Fox for the sum of £  s    d  the taxed amount of Mr Fox's expences incurred in defending himself against the memorable petition presented by Mr Tooke to the House of Commons The verdict of the Jury was with great deliberation and justice in favour of the plaintiff and Mr Tooke himself published an account of the proceedings Being a very active Member of the Corresponding Society he was taken into custody in May by a warrant from the Secretary of State on suspicion of High Treason and was afterward committed to the Tower His trial came on at the Sessions House in the Old Baily the November following  together with those of Hardy Thelwall c and ended in his acquittal In he offered himself for the second time as a candidate for representing the City of Westminster in company with Messrs Fox and Admiral Sir Alan Gardner Not having any prospect of success he amused himself upon the hustings with deriding Sir Alan Gardner before an ignorant unprincipled mob  However unpopular Mr Tooke may have made himself with the better part of mankind by the distinction he has aimed at as a Philosopher of the New Sect he is certainly entitled to the credit of firstrate abilities His style is clear and nervous and the acuteness of his intellect has seldom been equalled As a Scholar and Philologist his fame will probably live while our language exists and even as a Politician it has been said for him that he is one of the few of his day whose conduct has been uniformly consistent with itself  TOOKE REV  This gentleman was for many years Chaplain to the Factory at St Petersburgh He published in the year two volumes in octavo of "Russia or a complete Historical Account of all the Nations which compose that Empire" To these he afterward added two more volumes completing a work which has been generally thought to redound very  little to the credit of its author Mr Tooke has announced his intention of speedily publishing a Life of the late Empress of Russia in two volumes octavo  TOPHAM EDWARD ESQ  Formerly an Officer in the Guards and for a long time the Editor of the World a newspaper which he instituted on the first of January His first publication was an octavo volume of "Letters from Edinburgh" written in the years and and published in Mr Topham has since that time written an Address to Mr Burke on his Letter relative to the affairs of America the Fool a farce brought out at Covent Garden for the benefit of Mrs Wells the Westminster Schoolboy a farce which was very properly damned unheard by the Westminster Scholars the Life of the late John Elwes Esq the celebrated Miser a pamphlet and an Account of a remarkable Stone that fell from the Clouds Of these pieces the best written is the Life of Elwes  TOULMIN REV JOSHUA  A Socinian Minister at Taunton in Somersetshire His first publication was a single Sermon on  the Death of his Royal Highness William Duke of Cumberland in the year He has since that time published many more single Sermons a volume of Sermons addressed to youth first printed in duodecimo and afterward reprinted in octavo two Letters on the Applications to Parliament by the Protestant Dissenting Ministers published in Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Socinus in an octavo volume Letters to the Rev John Sturges in Answer to his Considerations on the present State of the Church Establishment published in Dissertations on the internal Evidences and Excellence of Christianity in an octavo volume an Essay on Baptism a Review of the Life Character and Writings of the Rev John Biddle the Father of the English Unitarians who was banished to Sicily in the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell The History of the Town of Taunton in a thin quarto volume a new edition of Neal's History of the Puritans in three volumes octavo and Memoirs of the Life of Dr Samuel Morton Savage prefixed to an octavo volume of the Doctor's Sermons Mr Toulmin is a sensible and a pleasing writer  TOULMIN GEORGE HOGGART ESQ MD  Author of a deistical octavo volume published in under the title "The Antiquity and Duration of the World" and republished five years afterward under the title "The Eternity of the World" This book has been admired by some readers for its learning and acuteness Dr Toulmin has also published "The instruments of Medicine or the Philosophical Digest and Practice of Physic" an octavo volume of some merit  TOWERS REV JOSEPH LLD  A Dissenting Clergyman formerly a Bookseller in Fore Street Obtaining the patronage of certain dissenting ministers he was encouraged to apply himself to the cultivation of letters and embraced the profession of a divine In he was chosen pastor of a congregation of protestant dissenters at Highgate and was elected four years afterward one of the ministers of the congregation at Newington Green he thus became jointminister of that congregation for several years with the celebrated Dr Price and still continues in the same office  In the year the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the degree of L L D  Of the literary productions of Dr Towers the first was a pamphlet entitled "A Review of the Genuine Doctrines of Christianity" which was published in Since that time he has published a Charity Sermon and many Tracts a chiefly temporary and political Of these Tracts a Collection was made by the Doctor in in three octavo volumes They are marked by an attachment to the interests of virtue and religion but are written upon whig principles and are characteristic of a politician who is more addicted to warmth than strict moderation can approve Dr Towers has also written the first seven volumes of a work entitled "British Biography" in ten volumes octavo Memoirs of the Life and Reign of Frederick III King of Prussia in two volumes octavo and an Oration delivered at the London Tavern November th on occasion of the commemoration of the Revolution and completion of a century from that great event He also gave considerable assistance to Dr Kippis in preparing the new edition of the Biographia Britannica and is supposed to be the editor of the last edition of the British Plutarch Dr Towers was said at one time to have engaged in writing a Continuation of Hume's History of England but we believe that plan is laid aside As a compiler he has great merit  TOWLE REV THOMAS BD  A Dissenting Minister He has published some Funeral Orations and is the author of a sensible Letter which appeared in Woodfall's Diary in Defence of the Dissenters on the occasion of an Attack upon them by Dr Tatham  TOWNLEY RICHARD ESQ  Author of "A Journal kept in the Isle of Man" published in two octavo volumes in A very indifferent performance  TOWNLEY REV GEORGE STEPNEY  This gentleman published in an octavo volume consisting of six Sermons of some merit which were preached before Paul le Mesurier Esq when Lord Mayor of the City of London at which time Mr Townley was his Chaplain  TOWNSEND REV JOSEPH  Rector of Pewsey Wilts Formerly of ClareHall Cambridge and afterward Chaplain to the late Jean Duchess Dowager of Atholl This gentleman's first publication was a single Sermon printed in In the year he published a small anonymous octavo volume entitled "Free Thoughts on despotic and free Governments" and seven years afterward a pamphlet consisting of Observations on various Plans offered to the Public for the Relief of the Poor It was in the year that Mr Townsend favoured the public with an Account of his Journey through Spain in and in three octavo volumes This work upon the whole does great credit to its author but had he been less circumstantial on subjects of chemistry and natural history as well as in describing local peculiarities of the country he would probably have succeeded better in the important point of attracting readers Since the appearance of this his chief publication Mr Townsend has set a very praiseworthy example to his reverend brethren by the proofs he has given the world of his attention to medical subjects In he published "The Physician's Vademecum" a duodecimo volume for the use of students and in the following year Vol I in octavo  of "A Guide to Health" to which he has since added another volume This work has been favourably received and the number of those readers will be small who cannot derive valuable information from it Few are the means so open for the general comfort of the poor as an imitation of Mr Townsend's example among the body of the Clergy In Mr Townsend published a short Dissertation on the Poor Laws  TOWNSEND REV JOHN  A Dissenting Minister at Rotherhithe He is the author of an anonymous pamphlet entitled "Remarks on the late Charge of the Bishop of St David's" Dr Horsley now Bishop of Rochester "Three Sermons" addressed to Old Middleaged and Young People and a few single Discourses  TOWNSHEND T ESQ  Of Gray's Inn This gentleman published a pamphlet in entitled "A Summary Defence" of Mr Burke which was abundantly abused for its absurdity by the Critics of the day  In the year following he published a duodecimo volume of Poems embellished with vignettes  TOWNSON ROBERT LLD FRSE  This gentleman has appeared before the public as an Experimenter and as a Traveller but with the greater success in the first capacity He printed at Gottingen in  Observationes Physiologicae  a quarto pamphlet containing highly curious and accurate observations on Amphibious Animals In he published in London "Travels in Hungary with a short Account of Vienna in the year " a quarto volume This work being ground untrodden by any of our late tourists must excite an attention which it is unfortunately illcalculated to gratify in a pleasing manner It discovers but two frequently the unclassical taste of its author  TRAPP REV JOSEPH  This Clergyman has been

Subscription Sir Harry has also printed one or two single Sermons  TRESHAM HENRY ESQ  An Artist of distinction who has spent much of his time in Italy He published anonymously in "The Seasick Minstrel" a poem which though marked with negligence and incorrect taste bespeaks poetical ability  TRIEBNER REV JF  A German Minister Author of several curious Theological Works In an octavo volume entitled "A Key to the French Revolution" he labours to prove that Pius VI and the Jesuits were the original instigators of that event Buonaparte had not yet reached the gates of Rome when this publication made its appearnce  TRIMMER MRS  Of Brentford A lady who has devoted her attention as an author to the improvement of young minds In she published an easy Introduction to the Knowledge of

title "The Philanthropic Monitor"  TROTTER THOMAS ESQ MD  Member of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh long a Navy Surgeon and lately Physician to his Majesty's Fleet under the Command of Admiral Lord Howe He published in "Observations on the Scurvy▪" a pamphlet in refutation of Dr Milman's opinions on the disease which was greatly enlarged and improved in a second edition in His position respecting the scurvy is that it is produced from a deficiency of vegetable matter alone which is confirmed by  proving from fact that impure air will not of itself occasion the disorder and that it is curable only by fresh vegetables or their acid in a natural state Dr Trotter has also written a Review of the Medical Department in the British Navy a pamphlet published in an octavo volume of Medical and Chemical Essays and  Medicina Nautica  being an account of the occurrences with respect to health of the channel fleet for three years in an octavo volume both of which were published in He is for the greater part a judicious writer a careful observer and an active promoter of improvements in the peculiar department of his profession  TRUSLER REV JOHN LLD  A Literary Pedlar whose smallware is of the vilest quality The first commodity which he offered to the public was a duodecimo volume entitled "Chronology" published in and which was afterward amplified into two volumes Since that time he has spawned upon the public innumerable goods of commercial historical theological political c fabric which are too contemptible to deserve enumeration He is the publisher of the worse of the two Clerical Almanacks and vends Sermons for the use of the pulpit printed in imitation of handwriting the most unspeakable  trash that can be conceived It is a scandal to the discernment of the literary world that such a pettifogging driveller in the trade of authorship has not long ago been ruined and broken  TUCKER REV JOSIAH DD  Dean of Gloucester A gentleman chiefly celebrated for his commercial and political Tracts In the early part of his life he was Rector of St Stephen's Bristol and Chaplain to the Bishop of that diocese His first publication was an excellent treatise entitled "A brief Essay on the Advantages and Disadvantages which respectively attend France and Great Britain with regard to trade" Some years afterward in he published Part I of Reflections on the Expediency of a Law for the Naturalization of foreign Protestants to which Part II was soon afterward added Since that time he has written many more pamphlets in this class a collection of which has been made in an octavo volume under the title "Tracts on Political and Commercial Subjects" Dr Tucker also published in a Treatise concerning Civil Government in reply to Mr Locke an octavo volume The boldness and spirit which he displayed as a political writer at one time brought the credit of his understanding considerably into question But his  early argument in favour of a separation from America and his reasonings to shew that no material disadvantage would arise from it were so far confirmed by experience and his principles in favour of free trade so naturally approved themselves to unbiassed minds that he was not long without a numerous set of admirers  In the class of Divinity Dr Tucker's first publication was an excellent tract in entitled "An Apology" for the Church of England written in opposition to the petitioning Clergy This was by far the best pamphlet on the occasion Soon afterward he published "Six Sermons" in a duodecimo volume Letters to Dr Kippis on his Vindication of the Protestant Dissenting Ministers two Sermons together with four Tracts on political and commercial subjects an Essay on Religious Intolerance a View of the Difficulties of the Trinitarian Arian and Socinian Systems and Seventeen Sermons in an octavo volume  We have understood that this gentleman is no relation whatever of the late Mr Abraham Tucker known in the literary world by the name of

obtained unprecedented honours by the numerous prizes adjudged to him for classical compositions Encouraged by the approbation of Dr Parr and some other distinguished scholars he published in the year a collection of these pieces in an octavo volume under the title  Prolusiones Juveniles Praemiis Academicis Dignatae  This volume published at the age of twentytwo years is a very singular testimony in favour of Mr Tweddell's attainments as an elegant scholar and if he shall cultivate his talents with becoming diligence we cannot doubt from these specimens that he will one day rank highly in the world for his literary credit If the volume can be said to have a fault it is an occasional appearance of affectation in the author as one instance of which among others it may be remarked that his beautiful Latin prose sometimes appears unnatural and sometimes even obscure from his strains and efforts to introduce choice phrases and expressions which may display his reading Mr Tweddell has for some years resided abroad  TWINING REV THOMAS MA  Late of Fordham near Colchester and Rector of St Mary Colchester A very distinguished Classical Scholar He published in in a quarto volume a Translation of Aristotle's Treatise on Poetry with Notes and two Dissertations a work which has gained him no small share of credit among the Learned Considered in every point of view it is one of the

sixpenny pamphlet  TWINING RICHARD  An eminent Teadealer in the Strand brother to the subject of the preceeding raticle He has published several intelligent pamphlets which are chiefly relative to the

deficient in ingenuity and good sense Mr Twiss belongs to the class of  petits maitres  in literature This circumstance was the occasion of two elegant and spirited poetical satires published in the year the first  an Heroic Epistle from Donnae Teresa Pinna Y Ruiz of Murcia to Richard Twiss Esq FRS  after the manner of the Heroic Epistle to Sir W Chambers and the second  an Heroic Answer from Richard Twiss Esq to Donna Teresa Pinnae Y Ruiz  by the same hand as the former In Mr Twiss published an octavo volume entitled "Chess" in which he gives a very complete and entertaining history of that game to this he added a second volume two years afterward Since that time he has written "A Trip to Paris in July and August " a thin octavo volume in which he is as usual volatile but for the greater part sensible  TYTLER A F ESQ  Professor of Universal History in the University of Edinburgh This gentleman distinguished himself with reputation in the controversy respecting Mary Queen of Scots His Enquiry into the evidence produced by the Earls of Murray and Morton written in favour of the innocence of that Queen was first published in It has been greatly enlarged in subsequent editions and now consists of two octavo volumes In the year Mr Tytler published a Plan and Outlines of his Course of Lectures on Universal History in an octavo volume a book whose judicious arrangement and matter render it peculiarly serviceable to the scholar We believe this gentleman was the first person in these islands who adventured in an airballoon In the year we are told he cleared  two barns and a stable  TYTLER HENRY WILLIAM ESQ MD  Fellow of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts He published in a Translation into English verse of the Works of Callimachus in a

compiled principally from Shakspeare  VANSITTART NICHOLAS ESQ MP  Of Lincoln's Inn Barrister at Law This gentleman published in the year a very seasonable pamphlet entitled "An Enquiry into the State of the Finances of Great Britain in Answer to Mr Morgan's FACTS" In this performance Mr Vansittart combated the disingenuous conclusions of his calculating adversary with considerable success and placed himself in a very favourable light as a gentleman of financial knowledge as well as of moderation and urbanity of behaviour About two years previously to this pamphlet Mr Vansittart answered the Letter to Mr Pitt under the signature JASPER WILSON written by Dr James Currie  VAUGHAN WALTER ESQ MD  Physician at Rochester He published in "An Exposition of the Principles of Anatomy and Physiology" in two octavo volumes which is a judicious commentary on the  Praelectiones Anatomicae  of Ferdinand Leber In the year following Dr Vaughan published a very ridiculous Essay Philosophical  and Medical concerning Modern Clothing and has since that time written a pamphlet on the superior Efficacy of the  Cinchona Flava  or yellow Peruvian Bark  VAUGHAN THOMAS ESQ  Author of "The Hotel or the Double Valet" an indifferent farce taken from two farces of Goldoni and brought out at Drury Lane in and "Love's Vagaries" a farce which was received with applause when acted in at Drury Lane for the benefit of Mrs Wrighten and Mr Vernon was many years afterward rejected by Messrs Kemble and Colman jun and printed in with a dedication to the  rejectors  for the benefit of the theatrical fund Mr Vaughan has also written some Prologues and Epilogues and we believe a novel entitled "Fashionable Follies"  VESEY FRANCIS ESQ  Barrister at Law He published in a folio volume of Reports of Cases in Chancery cotemporary with those by Mr William Brown  VEYSIE REV DANIEL BD  Fellow of Oriel College Oxford He has published a single Sermon preached before the University in and a volume of Sermons on the Doctrine of Atonement preached at the Bampton Lecture in the year These discourses possess some merit  VIDLER REV J  A Preacher of Universal Redemption and the Universal Restoration of Mankind He has published some single Discourses and was the editor of an Answer to Paine's Age of Reason by Mr Winchester  VILLIERS J C ESQ  This gentleman published in the year "Chaubert or the Misanthrope" a tragic drama the circumstances of which are related in Mr Cumberland's OBSERVER This piece though not calculated for representation has considerable poetic merit considering the age of the writer at the time of its publication Mr Villiers also published  in that year anonymously "A Tour through Part of France" in a series of entertaining letters forming an octavo volume  VINCE REV SAMUEL MA FRS  Plumian Professor of Experimental Philosophy in the University of Cambridge and a distinguished Mathematician He was originally of Caius College Cambridge took his degree of BA with the greatest distinction in the year was afterward for some time Member of Sidney Sussex College and at present resides in the town of Cambridge After reading the Plumian Lectures on Experimental Philosophy and Practical Astronomy for some years in the University he succeeded the late Dr Anthony Shepherd in the Professorship in the year  The first appearance of Mr Vince as an author was in the old mathematical gymnasium the Ladies Diary in which about thirty years ago he proposed three Questions and answered one In he published a useful but inelegant treatise on the Elements of the Conic Sections designed for students in the University preparatory to the Principia and has since that time published likewise from the Universitypress a Treatise on Practical Astronomy in a quarto volume a Plan of his Course of Lectures on the Principles of Natural  Philosophy an octavo pamphlet and Vol I of a Complete System of Astronomy a work which was greatly wanted Mr Vince also engaged in in association with Mr Wood of St John's College in the publication of a work entitled "The Principles of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy" which is intended to comprise in four octavo volumes the substance of the Lectures on those subjects which are usually read in the University The parts to be drawn up by Mr Vince are the Fluxions Hydrostatics and Astronomy of which the two first are already published  As a writer on subjects of science Mr Vince displays considerable ingenuity and acuteness Yet although his works are marked by the characteristics of that graceful School in which his habits have been formed they seem to want that superior polish which genius and elegance of mind alone can give Setting aside their frequent uncouthness of style and manner  Vide by way of  one  Instance among many Mr Vince's battle with the ANALYST p of his "Principles of Fluxions" His writings are full of striking examples of the  lucidus ordo  they appear rather the offspring of haste and hunger than the production of a learned Professor under the auspices of an university and in the enjoyment of academical leisure  VINCENT REV WILLIAM DD  SubAlmoner to his Majesty one of his Majesty's Chaplains in Ordinary Rector of Allhallows Thames Street and Head Master of Westminster School A gentleman of distinguished learning and respectability of character His first publication was a sensible tract entitled "Considerations on Parochial Music" which was published in Since that time he has published a Sermon preached at St Paul's before the Sons of the Clergy in a peculiarly excellent Sermon preached for the Westminster Dispensary in "The Origination of the Greek Verb an Hypothesis" a pamphlet which was afterward improved considerably enlarged and republished under the title "The Greek Verb analysed "  De Legione Manliana Quaestio ex Livio desumpta et rei Militaris Romanae Studiosis proposita  a very elegant and ingenious dissertation and "The Voyage of Nearchus from the Indus to the Euphrates" collected from the original journal preserved by Arrian and illustrated by authorities ancient and modern in a quarto volume The last of these works is accompanied by three dissertations the productions of Dr Horsley Mr Wales of Chirst Hospital School and Mr De la Rochette It is a very masterly performance  VINCENT SIR R BARTSee Hawke  UNDERWOOD MICHAEL ESQ MD

He has published two Sermons preached on particular occasions and "A Liberal Version of the Psalms into Modern Language" with notes in two volumes small octavo a performance which does him little credit in point of judgement or learning  WAKEFIELD GILBERT BA  Of Hackney A very distinguished Classical Scholar formerly a clergyman of the Establishment at present a dissenting layman Mr Wakefield was born at Nottingham in his father being then Rector of St Nicholas in that  town He was educated at the Freeschool Nottingham under the Rev Richard Wooddeson of KingstonuponThames and at Jesus College Cambridge having in his earliest infancy discovered that ardent desire of knowledge which from his unceasing application appears never to have been impaired At the "University Mr Wakefield cultivated useful learning with great success and on his admission to the degree of B A in received distinguished honours for his mathematical as well as for his classical attainments Soon after this he was elected Fellow of Jesus College and in was ordained a deacon Mr Wakefield was even then so little satisfied with the requisition of  subscription  and with the subjects of that subscription themselves that as he properly confesses in the MEMOIRS of his own Life he has since regarded this acquiescence as an action highly disingenuous While he held his station in the Church which has now for many years been relinquished he was successively for a short time curate of Stockport in Cheshire and of St Peter's and St Paul's in Liverpool In the year he removed to Warrington in Lancashire to accept the office of Classical Tutor at the dissenting Academy in that town Here Mr Wakefield remained until the dissolution of that seminary in when he removed to Bramcote near Nottingham with a view of receiving pupils and after a short residence at this place and at  Richmond lived for some years at Nottingham in the same occupation In he was chosen Classical Tutor of the New College Hackney since which time that town has been the place of his residence His connexion with the college ended a year after his acceptance of his office and his subsequent days have been spent in a diligent prosecution of his studies  Mr Wakefield commenced author in the year when he printed at the Cambrige press  Poemata Latine partim Scripta partim Reddita  with a few critical Observations on Horace in a small quarto volume Although he has since discovered one  false quantity  in these poems they do him great credit as a very elegant scholar at an early age His next publication was a new Translation of St Paul's first Epistle to the Thessalonians accompanied by such notes as were necessary to justify his variations from the established version This was published in and experienced a favourable reception His numerous subsequent publications followed each other at no very considerable intervals of time in nearly the following order viz an Essay on Inspiration considered chiefly with respect to the Evangelists a short Treatise on Baptism a new Translation of St Matthew with Notes critical philological and explanatory in a quarto volume Vol I in octavo of an Enquiry into the Opinions of the Christian Writers of the three first Centuries concerning  the Person of Jesus Christ which reaches to the conclusion of the apostolic age and which was not followed by more volumes for want of encouragement a Thanksgiving Sermon preached at Richmond in the Poems of Mr Gray with Notes in an octavo volume the Georgi  s of Virgil with Notes in an octavo volume Remarks on Dr Horsley's Ordination Sermon published in "Four Marks of Antichrist or a Supplement to the Warburtonian Lecture an anonymous pamphlet the Evidences of Christianity a tract which has seen two editions  Silva

were printed at the Cambridge press an Address to the Inhabitants of Nottingham relative to the Corporation and Test Acts which was reprinted by the Birmingham Dissenters a new Translation of those Parts only of the New Testament which are wrongly translated in our common Version Cursory Reflections relative to the Test Laws an Address to Dr Horsley on occasion of a pamphlet relating to the Liturgy of the Church of England ascribed to him a New Translation of the New Testament published in in three octavo volumes and since that time reprinted in two volumes an Enquiry into the Expediency and Propriety of Public or Social Worship a pamphlet  which has seen three editions Memoirs of the first thirtysix Years of his own Life in an octavo volume Short Strictures on Dr Priestley's Letters

Times a pamphlet published in Answers to both Parts of Paine's Age of Reason Remarks on the General Orders of the Duke of York to his Army on June th respecting the Decree of the French Convention to give no quarter to the British and Hanoverians Vol I in octavo of the Works of Alexander Pope Esq with Notes the commencement of a design which was afterward relinquished to Dr Warton and completed by Mr Wakefield only so far as by the publication of another octavo volume consisting of Observations on the remaining Poems of Pope a very elegant edition of Horace in two duodecimo volumes  Tragoediarum Graecarum de'ectus  in two volumes octavo Poetical Translations from the Ancients in a duodecimo volume a very beautiful edition of Bion and Moschus with Notes in a duodecimo volume a Reply to Burke's Letter to a Noble Lord a very elegant edition of the Works of Virgil in two duodecimo volumes a new edition of Pope's Illiad and Odyssey with Notes critical and illustrative in eleven volumes octavo a Letter to Mr Bryant relative to his Dissertation  on the War of Troy a Letter to Mr Wilberforce on the Subject of his PRACTICAL VIEW  Lucretii Opera innumeris mendis expurgata perpetuis Commentariis illustrata cum  RICARDI BENTLEII  notis non ante vulgatis  in three volumes quarto and  In Euripidis Hecubam Londini nuper publicatam  by Mr Porson  Diatribe extemporalis  an octavo pamphlet  It was the intention of Mr Wakefield had not the sources of academical favour ben dried up to have carried on his  Silva Critica  through the whole compass of ancient literature uniting theological and classical learning and illustrating the scriptures by light borrowed from the philology of Greece and Rome His Translation of the New Testament is a very valuable performance his edition of Pope's Illiad and Odyssey a very complete and elegant publication and his edition of Lucretius upon the large paper the handsomest book we almost ever recollect to have seen He has also written beside the pieces already enumerated a very masterly Essay on the Origin of Alphabetical Characters which was read to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester at two successive meetings was the more immediate occasion of his being elected an honorary member of that Society and has been inserted in the New Annual Register and in the Scotch Encyclopaedia It is likewise to be found with additions and improvements in the Memoirs of his Life Mr Wakefield is also an occasional  contributor to the Monthly and Gentleman's Magazines To the former he not long ago sent two Letters particularly remarkable in which he endeavours to do away a prejudice of considerable strength and standing respecting the elegance of the style of Hume  In contemplating Mr Wakefield's General Character as an author the first and highest commendation is due to his remarkable industry It is this active principle that has enabled him with a repectable share of talent to serve the truest interests of useful letters with far greater effect than has commonly fallen to the lot of firstrate genius His knowledge of Greek and Roman authors is extensive and accurate and as a critic he possesses a spirit most penetrating and ardent As an emendator he is frequently ingenious but certainly for the greater part too bold His Latin style as he himself acknowledges savours more of the expressive energy of Quintilian than of the magnificent volubility of Cicero It is not a little surprising and particularly to be lamented for the sake of Mr Wakefield's credit that with such peculiar faculties for the enjoyment of classical studies he should ever have forsaken that flowery path to share the grovelling walks of writers infinitely his inferiors relinquishing the loftiest distinctions of literary character for a pitiful display of partyspirit or peculiarity of opinion Some of his controversial writings theological as well as political  are peculiarly indecent for their violence and illiberality and his disposition appears upon these occasions to such disadvantage that his unpopularity seems a necessary consequence His English style is always manly and graceful and sometimes peculiarly elegant and energetic most readers will however object to his superabundant use of classical quotations His numerous writings have for the greater part experienced an indifferent reception and some of them particuliarly the earlier ones have been severely handled by the critics of their day  WAKEFIELD DANIEL ESQ  Author of a Letter to Thomas Paine in Reply to his DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ENGLISH SYSTEM OF FINANCE and of "Observations on the Credit and Finances of Great Britain" in Reply to Lord Lauderdale and Mr Morgan Both of these are sensible pamphlets  WAKEFIELD MISS

and judgement  WALCOT JOHN ESQ MD  Better known by his assumed name PETER PINDAR This comical genius is descended from a respectable family in Devonshire was bred to the study of physic and practised for some time with success in the county of Cornwall He afterward followed the fortunes of his friend the late Sir William Trelawney to Jamaica and became Physician General to the Island It is said that during his residence there he was induced upon a prospect of important preferment to assume the clerical function but that being disappointed in his views he resigned that office before his return to England and has never since resumed it On his arrival here he pursued his original profession for several years but at last relinquished it entirely It is to be recorded to the credit of Dr Walcot's benevolence as well as discernment that the art of painting is indebted to him for Mr Opie That artist was found by him in the Mines of Cornwall where his genius first discovered itself to the Doctor and he was encouraged by him to trust for his future fortune to the cultivation of his intellectual capability  Of his celebrated satirical pieces the first was a poetical Epistle to the Reviewers which appeared in the year and was followed by the first set  of Lyric Odes to the Royal Academicians i  These and his numerous subsequent productions were originally published separately in quarto pamphlets and were not long ago published in collection in four octavo volumes and likewise in three duodecimo volumes after several surreptitious collections of them printed in Ireland Few indeed have been the writings which have succeeded in commanding so large a share of attention as the detached pieces of Mr Peter Pindar Such was the demand for them that a certain number of the London booksellers agreed to allow him two hundred pounds per annum for the exclusive privilege of selling his works They are characterised by a species of humour which though not elegant and tasteful is not destitute of nature and is irresistible in its power of exciting laughter We consider BOZZY AND PIOZZI THE LOUSIAD and PINDARIANA as the best among them but have never contemplated the character of this writer without a mixture of surprize and concern that such talents and attainments as his writings discover him to possess should never have been applied to better purposes than to a Iudicrous display of his contempt of all decent respect and to the composition of such trifles as must inevitably perish with the age in which they were written  WALCOTT JOHN ESQ  This gentleman published in an octavo pamphlet consisting of curious Descriptions and Figures of Petrefactions found in the Quarries Gravelpits c near Bath Since that time he has undertaken a Delineation of the

performance though not distinguished for its elegance abounds in information  WARD ROBERT ESQ  Of the Inner Temple Barrister at Law Author of "An Enquiry into the Foundation and History of the Law of Nations in Europe" from  the time of the Greeks and Romans to the age of Grotius in two volumes octavo published in a work of very distinguished merit  WARE JAMES ESQ  A Surgeon of eminence and of particular skill in disorders of the Eye He published in Remarks on the Ophthalmy Psorophthalmy and Purulent Eye in an octavo pamphlet which has reached a third edition Mr Ware has also translated from the French de Wenzel's Treatise on the Cataract and published a pamphlet of Chirurgical Observations relative to the Epiphora or Watery Eye and another on the Causes which have most commonly prevented Success in the Operation of Extracting the Cataract  WARING EDWARD ESQ MD FRS  Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in the University of Cambridge and a gentleman of very singular mathematical talents especially for the abstruser analytical investigations He took his degree of B A with the greatest distinction in the year and while yet a Batchelor of Arts published the first edition of his  Meditationes Algebraicae  a quarto volume which has since that  time been twice reprinted Dr Waring has also published  Proprietates Algebraicarum Curvarum Excerpta Mathematica Miscellanea Analytica  and  Meditationes Analyticae  each a quarto volume These productions have been read by very few understood by still fewer and perhaps never regularly gone through by  any  man except their author The Doctor has held the above Professorship for nearly forty years He is one of the strangest compounds of vanity and modesty which▪ the human character exhibits The former is however his predominant feature and among other foibles he is given to lament that Newton was his predecessor in existence anticipating those discoveries in the laws of the universe which otherwise a WARING had unfolded  WARNER REV RICHARD  Curate of St James' Parish Bath and late of St Mary Hall Oxford This gentleman published in a duodecimo volume entitled "A Companion in a Tour round Lymington" and has since that time produced "Hampshire extracted from Domesdaybook" in a quarto volume Topographical Remarks relating to the SouthWestern Parts of Hampshire in two volumes octavo the History of the Isle of Wight in an octavo volume a single Sermon and an Illustration of the Roman  Antiquities preserved in the City of Bath in a quarto volume We have understood that Mr Warner some years ago engaged with several gentlemen in the design of publishing  the whole  of Domesdaybook on a plan similar to his extract of Hampshire He is a sensible and entertaining writer  WARRINGTON REV WILLIAM  Chaplain to the Earl of Besborough and author of an agreeable History of Wales which was first published in a quarto volume in and has since been reprinted in two volumes octavo  WARTON REV JOSEPH DD FRS  Warden of Winchester College and brother to the late celebrated poet laureat A literary veteran of the greatest distinction We believe the earliest of his publications was an Ode on reading West's Pindar which appeared in and has been followed by some other short poetical pieces among which is the Enthusiast or Lover of Nature A year or two after the above date he first published in four volumes octavo the edition of Virgil commonly known by the name of WARTON's AND PITT's VIRGIL adding to Virgil's original text  and Mr Pitt's translation of the Aeneid a new translation of the Eclogues and Georgics with Notes on the whole by himself and dissertations Essays c by himself and others This edition of Virgil has been reprinted in four duodecimo volumes as well as in octavo and bears a very respectable estimation among learned men With the merit of Mr Pitt's Version of the Aeneid the world is well acquainted Of Dr Warton's Eclogues and Georgics it may be said that they convey the sense of their originals with greater exactness and perspicuity than any other translation we have that their vesification is easy and harmonious and their style correct and pure yet if read for themselves they are inferior as pleasing poems to the similar performances of Dryden About the same time with this publication appeared also the first volume in octavo of Dr Warton's celebrated Essay on the Genius and Writings of Pope It was published anonymously and the second volume did not make its appearance till though part of it was printed nearly twenty years before that time This work though not always in harmony with later opinions is abundantly gratifying on account of its learning information and just taste In Dr Warton committed to the public the labour as it is said of sixteen years in his long lookedfor Edition of the Works of Pope printed in in nine octavo volumes The expectation which this work had excited in the literary world was in  some measure disappointed on its appearance It is one of the handsomest books which the modern elegance of typography has produced but it is deformed by marks of haste unpardonable in such an undertaking and the commentary is little more than a selection of the best of Warburton's notes combined with the corresponding parts of the editor's beforementioned ESSAY Yet though not so excellent a work of the kind as might be wished for it is certainly the best edition of Pope we have  WATKINS CHARLES ESQ  Author of "An Essay toward the further Elucidation of the Law of Descents" published in an octavo pamphlet in an Enquiry into the Title and Powers of his Majesty as Guardian of the Dutchy of Cornwall during the late Minority of its Duke a pamphlet published in and "Reflections on Government" a pamphlet published in the following year Mr Watkins also edited the fourth edition of Lord Chief Baron Gilbert's LAW OF TENURES in a royal octavo volume He is a sensible and a wellread writer  WATKINS THOMAS MA FRS  This gentleman published in two octavo volumes of highly entertaining and wellwritten Travels through Swisserland Italy Sicily and the Greek Islands to Constantinople made in the years and These volumes soon reached a second edition  WATSON RIGHT REV RICHARD DD FRS  Lord Bishop of Landaff Archdeacon of Ely Rector of Carstil in Leicestershire and Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of Cambridge A prelate distinguished for his various and extensive learning His Lordship was educated at Trinity College Cambridge was admitted to the degree of B A with distinguished credit in the year afterward became Prefessor of Chemistry in the University and was elected to his present Professorship in During a residence of more than thirty years he remained the glory of his University at one time by the ingenuity of his chemical researches at another as the pride of her divinitychair Of his Lordship's publications the first was  Institutiones Metallurgicae  a tract printed  at Cambridge in and intended as a textbook for that part of his chemical lectures which explained the properties of metallic substances He wrote six more chemical tracts during his residence in the University the greater part of which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions and they were all afterward reprinted in the fifth volume of his Chemical Essays His Lordship next published an Assize Sermon preached at Cambridge in which was followed by two Sermons preached at the same place in the year the publication of which first made him known beyond the precincts of the University one of them entitled "The Principles of the Revolution vindicated" delivered on the th of May the other on the Anniversary of his Majesty's Accession in that year These discourses according to the sentiments of their respective readers were subjects of high commendation on one side and of severe disapprobation on the other In the same year Dr Watson also published "An Apology for Christianity" a duodecimo volume consisting of a series of letters to Mr Gibbon which of all the answers made to the attacks of that gentleman was the most liberal the most elegant and perhaps the most forcible It is seldom indeed that controversy has been conducted with so much becoming urbanity and at the same time with so much spirit as upon this occasion In Dr Watson published a Sermon preached before the University  on the General Fast Feb th which was greatly admired and also a Discourse delivered to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Ely The year following produced the two first volumes in duodecimo of those "Chemical Essays" which have been so highly approved and to which three more volumes were afterward added They were written not with a view of giving a System of Chemistry to the world but to convey in a popular manner a general kind of knowledge to persons not much versed in chemical enquiries  Having been tutor to the late Duke of Rutland while His Grace resided at Cambridge Dr Watson was appointed through the interest of the Rutland family under the administration of the Marquis of Lansdown in to the Bishopric of Landaff Immediately upon his promotion his Lordship published a Letter to the late Archbishop of Canterbury recommending a new disposition of the church revenues by which the Bishoprics should be rendered equal to each other in value and the smaller livings be so far increased in income by a proportional deduction from the richer endowments as to render them a decent competency This letter produced several pamphlets at the press among which was a Letter to the Bishop from Mr Richard Cumberland vide that name Dr Watson's subsequent publications have been beside a few occasionial single Sermons a valuable Collection of Theological Tracts  in six large octavo volumes published in an octavo volume of Sermons and Tracts published in and consisting chiefly of his smaller pieces which had been published separately before that time as already enumerated three Charges delivered to the Clergy of the Diocese of Landaff an Address to young Persons after Confirmation a pamphlet which had been annexed to the first of his Charges Considerations on the Expediency of Revising the Liturgy and Articles of the Church of England a pamphlet published in and "An Apology for the Bible" in answer to Paine's AGE OF REASON Part II Among these his Lordship's Sermon for the Westminster Dispensary preached in and published with an excellent Appendix in as well as his most seasonable strong judicious and beautiful APOLOGY for the Bible are peculiarly entitled to commendation  As a writer Dr Watson has united with almost unexampled grace the knowledge of a scholar with the liberality of a gentleman the warm piety of a true christian and the open manliness of a wellintending character It has been said perhaps with truth that he is not a stranger to the pride of rank that he is not deaf to the whispers of ambition and that he feels with anguish the mortification of disappointment he has moreover rendered himself not a little conspicuous by his opposition to the measures of administration Yet whatever delinquencies his detractors may have  discovered none can with truth deny that his deportment in the course of a long an active and a conspicuous life has been marked by the characteristics of a very superior mind  WEBB DANIEL ESQ  A writer of distinguished taste and ingenuity He published in Remarks on the Beauties of Poetry in an octavo pamphlet and has since that time written an Enquiry into the Beauties of Painting Observations on the Correspondence between Poetry and Music "Some Reasons for thinking that the Greek Language was borrowed from the Chinese" "Literary Amusements" in verse and prose a small octavo volume and Selections from M Pauw with Additions an octavo volume  WEBSTER CHARLES ESQ MD  Of Edinburgh Compiler of  Medicinae Praxeos Systema ex Academiae Edinburgenae Disputationibus Inauguralibus praecipue depromptum  in three octavo volumes of which the two first were published in and the third in the following year Dr Webster also published in "Facts tending to show the Connection of the Stomach with Life  Disease and Recovery" a pamphlet intended as part of heads of lectures on materia medica the farther application of the doctrine to practice has been promised the Public  WENDEBORN REV D G FRED AUGUSTUS LLD  A German divine of distinguished ability formerly Minister of the German Chapel on Ludgate Hill and for nearly thirty years a resident of the metropolis In the year he published a German Grammar which was well received and republished in an improved state in Having met with encouragement in a small treatise upon England which he wrote with a view to the information of his own countrymen he some years afterward produced in a more extensive work on that subject in three duodecimo volumes written in the German language Of this he published a Translation in our language in the year in two octavo volumes under the title "A View of England toward the Close of the eighteenth Century" This work written with a philosophic spirit and abounding in sensible remarks is highly entertaining  WENTWORTH JOHN ESQ  Of the Inner Temple Barrister at Law This gentleman is publishing a Complete System of Pleading in royal octavo of which two volumes have made their appearance and has also written "The Action of Assumpsit on Bills of Exchange" c c  WEST MRS  The wife of a Northamptonshire farmer and a very respectable character in the literary as well as in the moral world She published in "Miscellaneous Poetry" in a quarto pamphlet and in "Miscellaneous Poems and a Tragedy" in an octavo volume by subscription Her poetry is natural simple and pleasing  WESTON REV STEPHEN BD  Rector of Little Hempston formerly Fellow of Exeter College Oxford and Rector of Mamhead in Devonshire A distinguished Classical Scholar skilled in various languages He published in  Hermesianax sive Conjecturae in Athenaeum  c  in an octavo volume a work which has not been thought peculiarly creditable to his talents Since that time he has published a single Sermon "An Attempt to translate and explain the Different Passages in the Song of Deborah" and an elegant Translation into Greek Verse of Gray's Elegy  WHALLEY REV THOMAS SEDGWICK  This gentleman prefixed his name in to Edwy and Edilda a poetical tale which he had published anonymously in He has also written Verses addressed to Mrs Siddons Verses vindicating his friend Miss Seward from the malignity of the Reviewers Mont Blanc a poem and a Collection of Poems and Translations in an octavo volume His poetry is not of the first order  WHITAKER REV JOHN BD  Rector of Ruan Lanyhorne in the County of Cornwall and formerly Fellow of Corpus Christi College Oxford A very ingenious learned and energetic writer His first publication was a History of Manchester in two volumes quarto the first of which appeared in It is writen upon a very elaborate plan but has obtained many admirers both as a work of ingenuity and acuteness  and of elegance and imagination In Mr Whitaker published "The genuine History of the Britons asserted" an octavo volume in refutation of Macpherson's INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORY OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND and in which he displayed an evident superiority over his adversary His next publication was a small octavo volume of Sermons upon Death Judgment Heaven and Hell which was printed in and has been generally thought to have added little to his reputation as an author This was followed in by his three octavo volumes entitled "Mary Queen of Scots vindicated" which closed the controversy respecting that Princess by a vindication of her innocence Although Mr Whitaker had been preceded on the same side of the question by the researches of Mr Goodal the acuteness of Mr Tytler and above all by the genius of Dr Gilbert Stuart he found means to discover some new materials for the defence of his heroine The  matter  indeed of this publication is excellent throughout but the  manner  is often highly reprehensible The subsequent productions of Mr Whitaker have been a Review of Mr Gibbon's History Vols IV V and VI which had originally appeared in the English Review "The Origin of Arianism disclosed" a large controversial tract in which there is an uncommon display of learning and judgement "The Course of Hannibal over the Alps ascertained" a very curious investigation in  two octavo volumes and "The real Origin of Government" a very singular pamphlet Mr Whitaker was also a very material contributor to the reputation which the English Review could at one time boast and has written some Poems in the Collection published by Gentlemen of Devonshire and Cornwall His vices as a writer are a general inequality and an occasional appearance of excesssive affectation in his style too strong a propensity to conjectural reasoning and sometimes too apparent a selfsatisfaction in his own performances For these we are however compensated by his many virtues  WHITAKER REV EW  Rector of St Mildred's and All Saints Canterbury and formerly Rector of St John's Clerkenwell This gentleman's first publication was a Fast Sermon in Since that time he has published a few more occasional single Sermons a Dissertation on the Prophecies relating to the final Restoration of the Jews four Dialogues on the Trinity three theological Tracts annexed to a Sermon a volume of Sermons on Education six Sermons in an octavo pamphlet and a View of the Prophecies relating to the Times of the Gentiles in a duodecimo volume chiefly in refutation of Mr Gibbon's attack on Christianity Mr Whitaker is a sensible and a judicious writer  WHITE REV JOSEPH DD  Archbishop Laud's Professor of Arabic in the University of Oxford and Fellow of Wadham College A gentleman of very distinguished talents and attainments His first publication was  De Utilitate Linguae Arabicae in Studiis Theologicis  an oration delivered in on his appointment to his Professorship and published the year following He next printed a Sermon recommending a Revisal of the English Translation of the Old Testament preached before the University in which was soon afterward followed by an edition of the Syriac Philoxenian Version of the four Gospels in a quarto volume with a Latin Translation by himself In Dr White presented the Public with "A Specimen of the Civil and Military Institutes of Timour or Tamerlane" a work written originally by that celebrated conqueror in the Mogul Language afterward translated into Persian and rendered from the Persian into English by the Doctor from a MS in the possession of Dr William Hunter This quarto pamphlet was followed three years afterward by a quarto volume of Institutes Political and Military written originally in the Mogul Language by the Great Timour translated from the Persian by Major Davy and published with the Persian translation a preface indexes  notes c by Dr White His celebrated volume of Sermons preached at the Bampton Lecture made its first appearance in the year in which they were delivered These discourses containing a view of Christianity and Mahometanism in their history their evidence and their effects Have obtained the most unbounded applauses of the literary world for their learning their strength and their beauty of composition in point of eloquence and energy of style we know of no happier specimens in our language It afterward appeared that these Sermons owed much of their excellence to the assistance given in their composition by the late Rev Mr Samuel Badcock Dr White was openly attacked with a charge to this purpose by Dr Gabriel of the Octagon Chapel Bath and a literary controversy ensued which produced several pamphlets at the press Dr White was at length induced to publish a statement of the case by which it appeared that literary and pecuniary obligations had reciprocally subsisted between Mr Badcock and himself and that the Sermons had received additional brilliancy from the masterly pen of Dr Parr It is said that Dr White has been for some time engaged in writing a History of Egypt  WHITE JAMES ESQ  Author of Conway Castle Earl Strongbow the Adventures of John of Gaunt the Adventures of King Richard Coeur de Lion and some other whimsical pieces  WHITE ROBERT ESQ MD  Author of a Treatise on the Use and Abuse of

 WHITEHEAD JOHN MD  A Physician who was formerly a quaker and afterward joined Mr Wesley's connection and became one of the stated preachers at his chapels He has written an Essay on Liberty and Necessity and was one of the first of those who undertook to refute the Doctrines contained in Dr Priestley's Disquisitions on Matter and Spirit publishing in a pamphlet entitled "Materialism philosophically  examined" Dr Whitehead has also published a Report of a new Method of Treating the P  erperal Fever the Sermon which he preached at the Funeral of Mr John Wesley a well written Life of Mr John Wesley in two volumes octavo and "Some Account of the Life of the Rev Charles Wesley a pamphlet extracted from the lastmentioned work  WHITEHOUSE REV JOHN  Of St John's College Cambridge This gentleman published an octavo volume of Poems in and has since that time written an Elegiac Ode to the Memory of Sir Joshua Reynolds and a quarto pamphlet of Odes moral and descriptive These performances possess considerable poetical merit  WHITELEY REV JOSEPH  Headmaster of the Free Grammar School in Leeds and Vicar of Lastingham formerly of Magdalen College Cambridge He has gained the Norrisian Prizes in the University for several sensible theological Essays which have been published according to the conditions of the institution  WILBERFORCE WILLIAM ESQ MP  A distinguished British Senator celebrated for his exertions to procure the abolition of the Slavetrade An elaborate and muchapplauded Speech delivered by him on this subject in the House of Commons May th has reached the press and in Mr Wilberforce published an octavo volume entitled "A practical View of the prevailing Religious System of professed Christians in the Higher and Middle Classes in this Country contrasted with real Christianity" The favourable reception which this volume experienced on its first appearance was probably owing to the celebrity of its author's name It has received much applause as well as censure according to the different characters of its readers and though undoubtedly written with a very benevolent view is perhaps justly amenable on the score of representing  real Christianity  as rigid calvinism Mr Wilberforce has also been the reputed author of the sensible little tract entitled "An Estimate of the Religion of the Fashionable world" but is said to have himself assigned it to Mrs Hannah More  WILKINSON JOSHUA LUSCOCK ESQ  Of Gray's Inn Author of "Political Facts" collected in a tour along the frontiers of France in a pamphlet a Translation of Mongaillard's  State of France hi May  and "The Wanderer" a collection of Anecdotes c during two excursions in and in France Germany and Italy in two duodecimo volumes all of them very indifferent performances  WILKINSON TATE  Patentee of the Theatres Royal York and Hull and a very celebrated Mimic He published in Memoirs of his own Life in four duodecimo volumes and in "The Wandering Patentee" a history of the Yorkshire Theatre These volumes are  well enough  WILLIAMS DAVID  A native of Glamorganshire He was originally a dissenting minister at Exeter and afterward preached for many years to a small congregation at Highgate Here he changed his principles and  being suspected relinquished the ministerial charge and adopted that of private tuition While at Highgate he preached a course of Sermons on Religious Hypocrisy which he published in two duodecimo volumes In he wrote a poignant Letter to Mr Garrick on his conduct and talents as manager and performer which was followed by polemical dialogues entitled "The Philosopher" When the Unitarian Clergy met at the Feathers Tavern to petition relief from subscribing the Articles the able pen of Mr Williams was solicited in their service he accordingly drew up some Essays on Public Worship Projects of Reformation c which were found to contain sentiments of so DEISTICAL a complexion that he was at once forsaken by the people whom he had designed to serve These Essays he published and afterward added to them an Appendix principally levelled at the Dissenters upon whose conduct he was peculiarly severe Mr Williams now totally forsook the connection of the Dissenters and became an avowed advocate of deism as well as of democracy In the time of his establishing a private seminary at Chelsea he published a Treatise on Education in a duodecimo volume which contains some uncommonly acute and judicious remarks on that subject while it too fully discloses the change in his principles with respect to revealed religion Two years after this date Mr Williams opened a Chapel in Margaret Street Cavendish Square on  the universal principles of Natural Religion a scheme to which he was instigated by Dr Franklin Dignified with the appellation  Priest of Nature  he officiated here for about four years and thus finally terminated his existence in a clerical capacity having subsequently employed his talents which are unquestionably great chiefly in the composition of political and deistical writings Beside the works already mentioned he has published a Sermon preached at the opening of his Chapel in Margaret Street a Liturgy for that Chapel "The Nature and Extent of Intellectual Liberty" a pamphlet a Plan of Association on Constitutional Principles a pamphlet written at the time of the riots in London Letters on Political Liberty occasioned by the county meetings and associations in Lectures on Religion and Morality in two volumes quarto Lectures on Education in three volumes octavo Lectures on Political Principles in an octavo volume

Apology for professing the Religion of Nature in the eighteenth Century" and the Pamphlets of Mr Swainson For an account of his engagement respecting a Continuation of Hume's History of England we refer the reader to our memoir of Mr Bowyer  WILLIAMS MISS HELEN MARIA  A fair Democrat of considerable sprightliness and talent She commenced author in by publishing anonymously "Edwin and Eltruda" a legendary tale in verse which was edited by Dr Kippis This was followed by some other pretty poetical Pieces which were reprinted in a Collection in two duodecimo volumes published by subscription in among which the historical poem entitled "Peru" and the Fragment found in a dark passage of the Tower have peculiar merit In Miss Williams published a Poem on the Slavetrade Bill and two years afterward a well written novel entitled "Julia" She went to France for the second time in the year and has since then resided at Paris In the year of her departure she published a Farewell to England a poem which has been followed by "Letters from France" relative to the Revolution in two duodecimo volumes Letters sketching the Politics of France from May st to July th in four duodecimo volumes and a Translation of Bernardin St Pierre's tale Paul and Virginia in a duodecimo volume the amusement of her hours of confinement in Prison at Paris under the tyranny of Robespierre Her LETTERS contain much information but too  plainly exhibit her want of sensibility and her political phrenzy John Hurford Stone is said to have contributed largely to the fourth volume  WILLIAMS JOHN LLD  Formerly a Dissenting Minister at Sydenham He has published an "Enquiry" intended to disprove the authenticity of Chaps I II of St Matthew's Gospel Thoughts on Subscription to the thirtynine Articles

the learned and judicious Dr Bell Prebendary of Westminster  WILLIAMS JOHN  Alias ANTHONY PASQUIN A scribbler of the lowest class Although destitute of every pretension to taste genius or information he has from time to time obtruded a multiplicity of pompous trash upon the Public viz the Children of Thespis the Brighton Guide the Pin Basket the Cap c too contemptible to enumerate In December he had the impudence to bring an action against Mr Faulder  Bookseller in New Bond Street as the publisher of Mr Gifford's poem the Baviad in one of the notes to which that gentleman had properly expressed his detestation of  one so lost to every sense of decency and shame whose acquintance is infamy and whose touch is poison  But Mr Garrow the counsel for the defendant shewed that he had libelled every body from the royal family down almost to the meanest of their subjects and that his writings were so immoral and infamous that he had no right to come into a court of justice for damages accordingly Lord Kenyon interposed and the cause was stopped The modest pretension it seems of this illiterate libeller is that he will caluminate all the world and go to law with whoever has the courage to censure or expose him for it  WILLIAMS REV EDWARD DD  A Dissenting Minister at Birmingham He has published "Antipaedobaptism Examined" in two volumes duodecimo and some single Sermons Dr Williams is one of the conductors of the Evangelical Magazine  WILLIAMS THOMAS WALTER ESQ  Barrister at law This gentleman has published "Original Precedents in Conveyancing" in four volumes octavo

usually read in the University The parts drawn up by Mr Wood are the treatises on Algebra Mechanics and Optics and the manner in they are executed especially the Algebra does great credit to the care and talents of their author they are a most respectable specimen of the elegant science of the Cambridge school and leave him nothing to fear from a comparison with his betterknown coadjutor  WOODFALL WILLIAM  A Reporter of public Debates highly celebrated for his accuracy and for a very remarkable tenaciousness of Memory Mr Woodfall was for some time the editor of the Morning Chronicle and afterward relinquishing that concern set on foot a paper which he called Woodfall's  Diary He is now entirely engaged in making reports of Debates in the Senate and at the Court of East India

A gentleman of very distinguished talents and attainments He was formerly a member of Magdalen College and removed to Trinity Hall on the prospect of succeeding to a very desirable situation After

have been confined to  "Reform" a farce modernized from Aristophanes by S Foote jun in which Chremylus and Plutus are translated by Thomas Paine and John Bull and "The Restoration of the Jews" a
