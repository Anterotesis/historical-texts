 A VIEW of NORTHUMBERLAND  with an EXCURSION to The  ABBEY  of  MAILROSS in SCOTLAND  By W HUTCHINSON  Anno  VOL II  NEWCASTLE  Printed by T SAINT for W CHARNLEY and Mess  rs  VESEY WHITFIELD  MDCCLXXVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  MY adoption of the word  Pater  in the Hexham Inscription engraved and facing page vol I having been objected to by an anonymous writer in order to shew it was by no means improper or singular I beg leave to refer the reader to the d volume of the Archaeologia page where in the  Sa∣lisbury Inscription  commented on by  Mr Gough  the words are  Pater Ecclesiae Salisbiriensis  and that writer gives it the antiquity of the beginning of the th century the supposed personage for whom that tomb was erected Roger third Bishop of Salisbury having been elected A D to that See  His munifi∣cence to his infant church intitled him to the name of Pater Ecclesiae Salisbiriensis  are his words The aera and occasion agree critically in the two instances others might be pointed out but this from its pertinence may seem sufficient  In my account of  Blanchland  page by former writers I was led into an error touching the family of Forsters to whom it formerly appertained This I presume will appear to be duly rectified in the account of Bambrough in this volume  The liberal minded reader I flatter myself will make allowances for such errors as appear in this work which consistent with its title is  a View  of the County  A VIEW OF NORTHUMBERLAND  WE repassed the  Tweed  by  Coldstream Bridge  a handsome structure of seven arches having had  WARK CASTLE  in view for several miles of our passage down the banks of the river a small part of it standing forms a rude pillar which at a distance ap∣pears of some consequence A platform lays to the west with a trench called  Gully's Nich  a mean village to the east from whence you ap∣proach the castle This fortress stood on a circular eminence formed by art its founder is not positively known nor is any certain date fixed to it In Leland's Collectanea part p it is said  King Henry the causid the Castel of Werke to be made  From several circumstances of history it appears that it was formidable so early as the beginning of the th century  Werke Castel on the southe syd of Twede A praty towne thereLel Itin v p  Near this place are several intrenchments some of which are de∣fended by mounds of earth  These mounds have a trench cross the crown of each  There is a spot adjoining called the  Battle Place  but from what particular event it obtained that denomi∣nation is not known As being on the borders this castle was subject to repeated assaults  On King Stephen's usurpation of the English crown David of Scot∣land with great indignation entered the borders and among other fortresses assaulted and took  Carrum  which Richard of Hexham says was by the English called  Werk  This is an error in the Historian the places are distinct and separate a considerable distance  On a treaty held whilst Stephen lay at  Durham  and David at  Newcastle  these conquests were restored by the Scotch King who took as a compensation  Carlisle  and some other places of less import as additions to the  Earldom of Huntington  which was then ratified to him Stephen also engaged that before any dispo∣sition was made of the  Earldom of Northumberland  he would cause the claim of Henry David's son thereto in right of his mother to be fairly heard by his Judges David received in marriage from King Henry I of England his brotherinlaw Maud the eldest daughter of Waltheof Earl of Northumberland from whom Henry his son de∣rived his pretensions to that Earldom Henry by the resignation of his father and King Stephen's ratification held the Earldom of Hunting∣ton  The determination of Henry's claim to Northumberland being sus∣pended and Stephen unwilling to bring it to a fair discussion sensible of the great power it would give to the Scotch crown irritated David to support his son's pretensions by force of arms Stephen's absence in Normandy favoured his purpose and soon after Easter in the year he levied a great army with intent to invade England The northern Barons with Thurstan Archbishop of York assembled the English forces at Newcastle and the Archbishop proceeding to Rox∣burgh then in the possession of the Scotch King in conference with David and his son prevailed on them to enter into a truce till Stephen's return when it was presumed the matter in contest would be honour∣ably accommodated but Stephen persisting in a denial of Henry's right war immediately ensued  The winter was set in when David flattered with hopes of an in∣surrection in England a plot  Ordericus VitalisL p  having been laid to massacre all the  Normans  and deliver the kingdom to him who was nearest heir in the  Saxon line  not regarding the rigour of the season dispatched his ne∣phew William son of Duncan with part of his army against the Castle of Wark  Richard of Hexham John of HexhamRedpath's Border History  William invested this fortress early in the morning and David with a numerous army and engines of war advanced soon afterwards to maintain the siege This investiture continued three weeks during which time the most vigorous assaults were sustained by the garrison under command of Jordan de Bussis nephew of Walter D'Espec Lord of Wark  Walter D'Espec had great estates in Yorkshire and was founder of the Abbey of Rievalle which he filled with Monks from St Barnard The scite of this abbey is by ancient writers de∣scribed to be melancholy and desert on a tract of land called Blackowmor on the banks of the river Rie from whence the monastery had the name of Rievalle Rie empties itself into Derwent The abbey of which there are fine remains to this day stands near Helmsley in Yorkshire We find a particular description of Walter D'Espec given by Ethelred or Ailred second Abbot of Rievalle an elegant and spirited writer in his History of the Battle of the Standard He is there represented as a person of the first eminence and esteem in the English army harangu∣ing them before the battle from the carriage in which the famous standard was erected  Vir senex et plenus Dierum acer ingenio in Consiliis prudens in Bello Amicitiam Sociis fidem sem∣per Regibus servans Erat ei statura ingens membra omnia tantae magnitudinis ut nec modum

facilis erat quadam soni majestate componens  Dec Scr  An account of the dispositions made by both armies before the battle known by the name of  Bellum Standardi  as collected from Historians of character may not be disagreeable to the reader in this place though not pertinent to this work  This expedition of  David  's was unfortunate to the  Scotch  they were joined by  Eustace FitzJohn Lord of Alnwick  who resented  Stephen  's taking from him  Bambrough  and who hoped to have regained that fortress by the arms of the Scottish King The  castle  sustained the assault of the whole army and remained impregnable  David  with fire and sword laid waste the country to  Durham  where he was joined by the men of  Galloway Cumberland  and  Carlisle  augment∣ing his army so that it consisted of men at the least He was opposed near  Northaller∣ton  by a much smaller number chiefly consisting of the nobles and men of Yorkshire headed by their  Archbishop Thurston  whose presence animated them to the highest pitch of bravery The mast of a ship having on its top a cross wherein was the consecrated host in a silver pix and the banners of St Peter St John of Beverley and St Wilfrid of Ripon waving below it was erected on the beam of a vast chariot Around this standard and some of them upon the carriage on which it stood were placed the more aged of the English Barons and with these  Roger de Moubrai  the infant Earl of  Northumberland Roger  was the son of  Negel de Albanei  who at the battle of  Tinchebrai  in Normandy took Duke Robert prisoner for which and other great services King Henry rewarded him by a gift of the lands of  Robert de Moubrai  Earl of  Northumberland  which had been forfeited on account of his rebellion against William Rufus His presence drew around him all his vassals who made no inconsiderable part of the English army Immediately before the battle  Ralph Bishop of the Orkneys  deputed by the aged and infirm  Thurstan  having assured the army that by fighting bravely they would purchase the remission of their sins did on receiving their confessions actually pronounce their absolution joining to it his benediction at the same time the priests in their white vestments carrying crosses and relics went among the ranks encouraging the soldiers by their exhortations and prayers These pious acts were accompanied with a wise arrangement of the English warriors adapted to sustain and repel the first fierce onset of their enemies The  Abbot of Rievalle  re∣lates that  David  was prevented making the disposition he intended by the obstinacy of the  Gall  waymen  who claimed it as their right to fight in the van a station which  David  and his best officers perceived they were not fit for on account of their wanting heavy armour such as was borne by those who stood in the first rank of the English army The King however fear∣ing sedition at a time when it might have proved so fatal was obliged to grant these troops their request The next line was commanded by  Prince Henry  consisting as  Aulred  says of knights and archers or according to  Huntington  of English and Norman horsemen who be∣longed to his father's household and with them the men of  Cumberland  and  Tiviotdale  In this division was also  Eustace FitzJohn  The third line consisted of the  Laodomains  with the  Islanders  and  Lavernans  The King had in his own line the  Scots  and  Murraymen  and for his body guard a band of English and Scotch Knights  Robert Brus  and  Bernard Baliol  both of whom besides the great estates they possessed in England did also hold lands of the Scottish King went to him before the battle and endeavoured to persuade him to retire assuring him that  Northumberland  should be delivered to his son  Henry  but not being able to prevail they renounced their fealty to  David  and returned to fight under the English standard"  Richard HagulstAilz Abb Rev C Lord LyttletonSir James Dalrymple  David was obliged to raise the siege with disgrace his forces were much reduced and his Standardbearer fell among the slain The bor∣der conflicts were all after one mode rendered horrible by ravage and rapine David after his departure from before  Wark  led his forces to the western parts of Northumberland where he spread desolation and ruin and marked his progress as far as Tyne with acts of savage cruelty  To oppose these invaders Stephen at the head of a numerous army advanced to  Wark  which obliged David to abandon Northumberland and prepare to defend his own territories but Stephen apprized of a plot which was laid to entrap him at  Roxburgh  returned to England without effecting any thing against his enemy David seeing the Eng∣lish forces had abandoned the border after taking and demolishing  Norham  advanced against  Wark  to revenge an insult the garrison had committed by taking some baggage and giving annoyance to his troops marching under his son Henry His success in this second at∣tempt was no better than in his former assault he exerted his powers employed every engine the art of war had introduced and with much  bloodshed persisted in the siege till conceiving the fortress was im∣pregnable to every other manoeuvre than a blockade which could cut off provisions and reinforcement he determined thereon and march∣ing southward with the main body of his army left there a circumval∣lation of troops under the care of two of his Barons  David soon after had a dreadful defeat near  Northallerton  at the  Battle of the Standard  after which he retreated with the shattered remains of his troops to  Carlisle  through a country enraged at the barbarities he had been guilty of in his former incursion the peasants in every avenue revenging on his flying troops the sufferings their families had sus∣tained After a short respite and a collection of his scattered army at  Carlisle  he commanded the siege of  Wark  to be resumed in which many newinvented engines and machines were employed The be∣sieged with unparallelled fortitude sustained the shock their skilfulness is as admirable as their courage for they lost but one Knight whose in∣trepidity in attacking a machine exposed him to numbers of assailants in the midst of whom he fell after testifying the highest human valour The slaughter made by the garrison was terrible insomuch that David relaxing his rigorous command ceased all assaults and again formed a strong blockade The garrison were reduced to great extremities they had killed their horses and salted their flesh for food and when that was nearly consumed resolved as soon as all provision was exhausted to make a general sally and cut their passage through the lines of the assailants or die sword in hand During this interval  Walter D'Espec  their Lord willing to preserve so brave a corps sent the Abbot of Rie∣valle with his command that the garrison should surrender the place on whose arrival a treaty was entered into in consequence of which the garrison capitulated and were permitted to march out of the castle un∣der arms with horses provided them by the Scotch King On this evacuation the castle was demolished and the fortifications were rased  King Henry  II to strengthen the frontiers of his kingdom against the Scots ordered the fortifications of the castle of  Wark  to be restored  AD Iterum firmatum est castellum de Werk praecepto Regis Lel Collecta  King John  in the year in resentment of the defection of the northern Barons who had done homage to Alexander II at  Mailross  advanced to the borders and amongst other places reduced  Wark  to ashes M Paris gives the following account of this horrid expedition  Deinde Rex Ira succensus vehementi apud partes Scotiae tendebat cismarinas et captis Castris de Berwic et aliis quae videbantur inex∣pugnabilia improperavit Regi Alexandro et quia erat Rufus signi∣cavit ei dicens sic sic fugabimus rubeam vulpeculam latibulis suis multum igitur ibidem stragem et exterminium exercuisset nisi eundem necessitas magna dilationem non capiens revocasset  King Edward  on the breach of fealty by John Baliol in the year having levied a great army advanced towards the Scotch bor∣ders and halting at  Bamburgh  received intelligence that Robert de Ross Lord of  Wark  had abandoned his castle and gone over to the Scots being enamoured of a Scotch woman whose affection he pre∣ferred to his duty and allegiance his brother William remaining in the fortress dispatched a messenger to require immediate aid of the King as he apprehended Robert would attempt to deliver  Wark  to the enemy King Edward immediately ordered men to march to sustain William and his garrison who on their arrival were attacked in their quarters in the night in a small village called  Prestfeu  by Ro∣bert de Ross with a detachment from  Roxburgh  who burnt the village and put the reinforcement to the sword King Edward soon after this disaster marched with his whole army to  Wark  where he continued to celebrate the festival of Easter  In the reign of King Edward II  Wark  was taken by the Scots under King Robert Brus by assault In Leland's Collecta p it is said that the Scottes came into the Marches of England and de∣stroyed the castelles of Wark and Harbottle  As King David Bruce with his victorious army was returning from Durham in the summer of the year where he had imbrued his hands in the horrid massacre of all ages and both sexes had spoiled and plundered the sacred places and put the religious to miserable deaths the rear of his army passing the castle of  Wark  loaden with spoils were seen by the garrison with the greatest indignation Sir William Mon∣tague was then Governor and the Countess of Salisbury whose Lord the fortress then belonged to resided there The Governor with horsemen made a sally attended with considerable slaughter bringing into the castle horses laden with booty King David incensed at  this insult led his army against the castle and made a general assault but met with a repulse attended with great bloodshed David then prepared to fill up the ditches and bring his battering engines to play upon the walls the imminent danger of the garrison rendered it neces∣sary to send information of their situation to the English Monarch who was approaching the borders with a considerable army The place be∣ing close invested rendered such an attempt perilous but it was ef∣fected by the Governor himself on a fleet horse in the darkness and tumult of a stormy night he passed through the enemy's lines and carried intelligence to King Edward who redoubled his speed to relieve the place The Scotch Chieftains unwilling to hazard the treasures they had reaped in their expedition persuaded the King to raise the siege and pass the Tweed which was done only six hours before the van of the English army appeared The joy of the Countess of Salisbury for this relief and her pleasing deportment whilst she entertained the King at Wark were the beginning of an amour to which the famous institution of  the order of the Garter  is said to owe its origin  In the reign of King Richard II  A D Rich Scotti ceperunt castellum de Werk super Fluv Twede depraedatum incenderunt Lel Collecta  it was besieged by the Scots and part of the fortifications destroyed  Soon after the accession of King Henry IV the truce made with Richard II expiring the Scots made an incursion in which they took the castle of Wark and after holding it some time utterly demolished the works It was a fortress of too much consequence to be neglected and therefore we find it soon after restored and in a state of defence for in the same reign it sustained many shocks with various degrees of fortune In in the absence of the King of England who was then in France hostilities being commenced on the borders William Haliburton of Fast Castle took the castle of  Wark  which was then in the keeping of Robert Ogle and put all the garrison to the sword but it was soon recovered by the English who from a perfect knowledge of the place made their way by a sewer which led from the kitchen into the Tweed and surprizing the garrison put them all to death in revenge for their cruelty on Ogle's troops  In the reign of Henry VI the Scots gathered great booty on the Marches and among many other castles which they assailed  Wark  was taken and demolished  The castle was afterwards repaired by the Earl of Surry and in the year in the th year of the reign of King Henry VIII the Scotch army laying at Coldstream resolved to attempt the reduction of  Wark  under the command of the Duke of Albany Sir John Lisle be∣ing then Governor Buchanan the Historian being present at the siege gives the following description of the castle  In the innermost area was a tower of great strength and height this was encircled by by two walls the outer including a large space into which the inha∣bitants of the country used to fly with their cattle corn and flocks in time of war the inner of much smaller extent but fortified more strongly by ditches and towers It had a strong garrison good store of artillery and ammunition and other things necessary for defence  The Duke of Albany sent against it battering cannon and a chosen band of Scots and French to the number of under the command of Andrew Ker of Fairnherst The French carried the outer inclosure at the first assault but they were dislodged by the garrison setting fire to the corn and straw laid up therein The besiegers soon recovered it and by their cannon effected a breach in the inner wall The French with great intrepidity mounted the breach sustaining great loss by the shot of those who possessed the tower or keep and being warmly re∣ceived by the forces that defended the inner ballium were obliged to retire after a great slaughter The attack was to be renewed the suc∣ceeding day but a fall of rain in the night which swelled the Tweed and threatened to cut off the retreat of the assailants to the main army and the approach of the Earl of Surry who before lay at Alnwick with a large force obliged the Duke to relinquish his design and repass the Tweed  The present remains of  Wark  do not in any wise strike the traveller with an idea of so formidable a fortress as it assuredly was for many centuries At what time it was dismantled and thus totally destroyed I have not been able to learn but it is probable it was one of the strong∣holds ordered to be demolished by King James VI of Scotland on his accession to the crown of England  The great convention for the settlement of the tenths demanded by King Henry II in the year was held at  Brigham  near  Wark  Hugh Bishop of Durham was the chief of King Henry's Envoys and was met by King William the Lion of Scotland his Bishops Earls Barons and a vast concourse of inferior vassals when the Scotch re∣jected the demand with the utmost contempt In the year we read of  Wark  receiving the Earl of Rutland and his army after their Scotch expedition  Wark  was the barony and ancient possession of the family of Ross  Robertus Ros tenet Baroniam de Werk Lel Col  William de Ross  was a competitor for the Crown of Scotland in the th year of King Edward I and was one of those Lords who in pro∣tested against the supremacy of the See of Rome over Scotland  Robert de Ross  one of this family with  John de Baliol  were guardians of  Alexander  King of Scotland on his marriage with  Margaret  eldest daughter of  King Henry  III of whom the following unaccountable anecdote gained acceptation  That they were guilty of injurious conduct towards their charge by denying them social intercourse on the information of an English Physician they were punished Baliol by a large sum in mulct and Ross by confis∣cation of his estates King Henry and his Queen from their parental feelings made a jour∣ney to Edinburgh to see them possessed of their wishes  This remarkable tale we have in Hollinghead's Chronicle  William de Ross  the successor of  Robert  on the death of  Alexander  King of Scotland was a competitor for that Crown with  William de Vesey  Baron of  Alnwick Florence  Earl of  Holland Patrick de Dunbar Robert de Pinkney Nicholas de Sauls Patric Golightly Robert Bruce  and  John Baliol    John Lord Ross Baron of Wark was one of the guardians of the Crown during the minority of King Edward III It continued in that family to the end of the th century when by the escheats of King Henry IV it appears to have become the possession of the  Greys  Of this illustrious family of Greys we have the following account  Their arms gules a lion rampant with a border engrailed argent  Sir Thomas Grey High Sheriff King Henry IV  Sir Ralph ditto King Henry VI  Sir Ralph ditto Queen Elizabeth  Sir Thomas ditto Queen Elizabeth  Sir William created a Baronet King James I  He was made a Peer by the title of Lord Grey of Wark King James I  Lieutenant General of the parliament army under Lord Fairfax  joint Chancellor with Lental of the Duchy of Lancaster King Charles I  made joint Keeper with Sir Thomas Widdrington of the Great Seal His son  Ford Grey was created Viscount Glendale and Earl of Tankerville King William III  He married Mary daughter of Earl Berkley and had one child Mary who married Charles Bennet Earl of Ossulton  Ralph Grey Governor of Barbadoes  Lady Ossulton his niece became his heir and having a son he was created Earl of Tanker∣ville King George I His son  Charles Earl of Tankerville was Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland and Newcastle upon Tyne  Charles the present Earl of Tankerville  who took their  title from the place  In Lord Wharton's proposals for better protection of the Marches it seems that the castle of Wark was then held by the Crown On the accession of King James I all the fortresses on the borders were ordered to be reduced and dismantled and it is most probable that was the period when Wark went finally to ruin  in the descendants of which family it has conti∣nued to the present time being now the property of  Lord Tankerville  Mr Pennant remarks from the Life of Lord Keeper Guildford that  after the union of the two kingdoms by the accession of King James I Lord Grey's estate rose from l to or l a year so instantly did these parts experience the benefit  Near to  Wark  lays  CARHAM  memorable for the battle fought here with the Danes In Leland's Col p it is thus mentioned  In the yere of Ecbrighth the Danis arrived at Lindisfarne and fought with the Engles at Carham wher eleven Bishopes and Englisch Countes were slayne and greate num∣bre of people  At this place a great battle was fought in the year in which the Scots were victorious and almost all the fighting men between Tees and Tweed were cut off together with their Chief∣tains on which event it is said by some authors that  Aldun  Bishop of Durham died brokenhearted  Infelicissime pugnatum ab Anglis contra Scottos apud Carham Lel Collectea  Here was an  Abbey  of Black Canons subordinate to  Kirkham  in York∣shire In the th year of King Edward I it was burnt by the Scots then led by Wallace whose encampment gave name to an adjacent field In Edward's letter to Pope Boniface he describes their cruelties in a most horrible manner  The Scots inhumanly de∣stroyed an innumerable multitude of his subjects burnt monasteries churches and towns with an unpitying and savage cruelty slew infants in their cradles and women in childbed barbarously cut off womens breasts and burnt in a school whose doors they first built  up about young men who were learning their first letters and grammar  Rym II In the th year of King Edward III Sir John Lilburn was defeated by the Scots near this place under the command of Sir John Gordon who was returning from an incursion with many prisoners and a great train of cattle the engagement was fierce and its decision long doubtful the Scots being driven from their ground and returning again five several times In the end Sir John and his brother were made prisoners  We arrived at  CORNHILL  noted for the valuable  Spaws  near it By the escheats of the st year of King Edward I we find this place mentioned as the possession of  William de Cornhill  The  castle of Cornhill  I presume was the fort or tower near Cornhill Bridge and opposite to  Linnel House  The remains are surrounded with a ditch called the  Castle Stone Nich  It has been well situated for defending the passage over the river Here is a seat house of  Henry Collingwood  Esq  commanding a view of the ground we had traversed on the north side of Tweed extended to the Helton Moun∣tains and on the southern side of the river having a prospect of a wide country over which many Gentlemen's seats are dispersed the whole closed by a range of mountains of which Cheviots are supreme In on an incursion of the Scots they took the castle of Cornhill described as being an old house of considerable strength  Ridpath's Border History  and a valu∣able booty was gained  In in pulling down Cornhill chapel there was found about three feet lower than the old foundation a coffin of stone about eight feet long in which were two urns of coarse pottery and the shank bones and scull of a person of great size  Southeast of  Cornhill  is a remarkable encampment but to what people or to what particular event they appertained I have gained no certain information The several lines are of great extent but as they form no regular figure in their present state do not merit a par∣ticular description what is worthy of notice is the mode in which the  works are defended by ranges of conic eminences a thing singular and what rather confounds my judgment as to the antiquity of the place and who were its occupants Mr Wallis says they are sepulchral Tumuli from which opinion I must beg leave to dissent  In Branxton West Field is a column placed as a memorial of the battle fought there on the th of September in the th year of the reign of King Henry VIII called the battle of  Flodden Field  from the Scotch encampment on Flodden Hill The disposition of the Earl of Surry's forces was such as to oblige the Scotch to come to an en∣gagement their retreat into their own country being cut off  James IV had wasted much time at  Ford  captivated as it is said by the beauties of the daughter of  Sir William Heron  so as give the  Earl of Surry  time and opportunity for advancing towards the borders with a large army The Scottish Nobles were averse to hazarding a battle and strenuously insisted on the policy of their return into their own country loaded as they were with spoils and having gathered many laurels in their campaign but  James  fired with resentment at the challenges sent by  Surry  determined to engage the English and for that purpose made choice of an advantageous situation for his army in the neighbourhood of  Ford  The eminence called  Flodden  lays on the opposite side of the river  Till  it is the last and lowest of those hills that extend on the northeast of the great mountain of Cheviot towards the low grounds on the side of the Tweed from which river Flodden is distant about four miles The ascent to the top of it from the side of the river Till where it takes a northerly direction just by the foot of the declivity on which the castle and village of Ford stands is about half a mile and over the Till at that place there is a bridge On the south of  Flodden  lays the extensive and very level plain of  Mil∣field  having on its west side high hills the branches of Cheviot on the north Flodden and other moderate eminences adjoining to it on the south and east a tract of rising grounds nigh the foot of which is the slow and winding course of the  Till  The nearest approach for the English army to  Flodden  was through this plain in every part whereof they would have been in full view of the Scots where they had a great advantage in possessing an eminence which on the side towards the English had a long declivity with hollow and marshy grounds at its foot while its crown contained such an extent of almost level ground as would have sufficed for drawing up in good order the forces that  occupied it  Surry  encamped on  Wooler Haugh  on the th of Septem∣ber sent a Herald with a challenge to join battle in the plain the next day between the hours of twelve and three This challenge was dated the th of September o'clock in the afternoon as appears by Stowe p The names of the subscribers were  Surry  and his  Son Thomas Dacre Clifford Henry Scrope Ralph Scrope Richard Latimer William Conyers John Lumley R Ogle William Percy Edward Stanley William Molineux Marmaduke Constable William Gascoyne William Griffith George Darcy William Bulmer Thomas Strangeways  c  James  did not accept the challenge but lay in his intrenchments whilst  Surry  ad∣vanced his army near to  Barmoor Wood  about two miles distant from the Scotch army and lay there all night A little hill on the east of  Ford  covered the English army from the observation of their enemies whilst from this eminence the Lord Admiral obtained a distinct view of all the Scottish army and of all the eminences near it The next morning the English made some marches to amuse the enemy and then gained the ground which cut off  James  's retreat to Scotland By this position of his forces  Surry  had an access opened to the Scottish camp much less difficult and dangerous than on the other side of  Flod∣den  The batteries raised by the Scotch to command the Bridge of of  Ford  of which the vestiges still remain were now rendered of no use The Scots deluded either by the treacherous advice of one  Giles Musgrave  who engaged the King's confidence and abused the royal ear or depending that  Surry  by his mode of marching the army in∣tended to gain  Berwick  and avoid a battle appeared now to be con∣founded by the manoeuvres of the English which bespoke their deter∣mination to come to an engagement in order to receive them with the greater advantage and to gain the ground they supposed the English would attempt to possess on the western side of the hill the Scots set fire to their huts on the eastern side and made a motion to the west The smoke being driven between the armies concealed the progress the English were making till they had almost gained the foot of the hill  Surry  observed the confusion his approach had occasioned among the Scotch troops and finding the ascent of the hill short and mode∣rately steep determined not to delay the onset  The English were disposed in three divisions the van under  Thomas Howard  the General's eldest son Lord Admiral of England the right wing being led by  Sir Edmund Howard  brother to  Lord Thomas  and Knight Marshal of the army The middle division or main battle was  led by the  Earl of Surry  in person and the rear by  Sir Edward Stanley  The  Lord Dacres  commanded a body of reserve consisting of horsemen The ordnance was placed in the front of the battle and in the openings of the several divisions After they had passed the little brook of  Sandy∣ford  the Lord Admiral perceiving the Scots approaching towards him drawn up in four great bodies armed with long spears like Moorish pikes sent to his father the Agnus Dei that hung at his breast as a token accompanying a request that as the van of the army was not sufficiently strong or extensive to receive the brunt of the whole Scottish army his father would bring up the forces of his division and range them in a line with the van The English General convinced of the expediency of this disposition immediately came forward with his forces and drew them up to the left of those of his son The mode in which the Scots advanced to battle is variously described Paulus Jovius says they were formed in five square bodies so that the third of those in which the royal standard was erected and all the chief men fought was inclosed on each side by a double line forming as it were two wings Comparing the several accounts it seems most probable that the battalia was thus arranged The van of the Scotch army led on the right by  Alexander Gordon Earl of Huntley  and on the left by the  Earls of Crawford and Montrose  and some say  Lord Hume  the  King  was in the center or main body a third division was commanded by the  Earls of Lenox and Argyle  with whom were  Mackenzie Maclean and the Highlanders Adam Hepburn Earl of Bothwell  with his kindred and clan and the men of Lothian formed a body of reserve They had with them a large train of artillery The English artillery began to play which made a dreadful carnage whilst the Scotch cannon from their high situation took little or no effect the shot going over the heads of the English This obliged the Scotch to advance the  Earls of Lenox and Argyle  to∣gether with  Lord Hume  moving with a body of ten thousand spearmen supported by some horse down the hill towards  Branxion  made a fierce attack on the wing commanded by  Sir Edmund Howard  The shock was violent the Scots prevailed and  Sir Edmund  was reduced to the last extremity himself beaten to the ground the third time and in im∣minent peril of Death when  Lord Dacres and Heron the Bastard  who had joined the English army with a troop of fierce outlaws his fol∣lowers came in time to his rescue  Sir Edmund  thus relieved imme∣diately joined the body commanded by his brother  Lord Thomas  and they advancing against the  Earls of Crawford and Montrose  whose troops were armed with spears put them to the rout and both the Earls were  slain On the other side of the field  Sir William Stanley  with the forces from Lancashire and Cheshire being bowmen forced the Scots to break their array and descend to closer fight in more even ground where they were soon thrown into confusion and put to flight after leaving the  Earls of Argyle and Lenox  with the slain The English attributed this success to the archers but the Scotch writers alledge the miscarriage of this part of their army was owing to the undisciplined ferocity of the Highlanders who animated by the success of the attack made on that wing of the English army commanded by  Sir Edmund Howard  could not be restrained from rushing impetuously forward in an irre∣gular and open manner notwithstanding the signals cries and menaces of the French Ambassador  La Motte  who perceived the consequence of such an improper and loose attack  The King  of Scotland whose bra∣very kindled to extravagance of courage at the perils which now seem∣ed to surround him deaf to every advice and remonstrance pressed forward and exposed his royal person to all the dangers of the field being sustained by  Bothwell  and his band he charged on foot at the head of the best of his troops whose armour resisted the arrows of the English archery he pressed forward to the standards of the  Earl of Surry  and with such ardour and valour that they were nearly gained by this heroic phalanx but at length the wings of the Scotch army being totally routed all the English forces were employed against this valiant band who were surrounded by the coming in of  Lord Dacre  's horse in the rear  A considerable body of Borderers commanded by  Lord Hume  stood aloof during the most arduous part of the battle and when he was required by  Huntley  to attempt the King's deliverance from the circle of his enemies he answered  that the man did well that day that stood and saved himself  Before the battle the  old Earl of Angus  anxious to dissuade the King from engaging was told by his Sovereign  that if he was afraid he might go home  The Earl judging it repugnant to his honour to fight under the standard of a Prince from whom he had received so great an affront requested he might be dismissed the ser∣vice but as pledges of his loyalty and firm attachment to  James  left as hostages of his honour a large body of kindred and dependents with his two sons who both fell in the battle  This memorable battle  began at four o'clock in the afternoon and continued till it was dark  King James  IV was slain with his natural  son  the Bishop of St Andrews  In the ingenious notes by the Rev Mr Lamb of Norham to the ancient poem on Flodden Field Fight we have the following concise account of Howard Earl of Surry "Thomas Howard Earl of Surry was knighted for his remarkable courage at the battle of Barnet he was made Knight of the Garter King Richard III He was taken prisoner at the battle of Bosworth and committed to the Tower by King Henry VII and attainted by Parliament King Henry asked him how he durst bear arms in behalf of that tyrant Richard To which he answered  He was my crowned King and if the parliamentary authority of England set the crown upon a stock I will fight for that stock and as I fought then for him I will fight for you when you are established by the said authority  In the rebellion against the King by the Earl of Lincoln the Lieutenant of the Tower offered him the keys of the Tower in order to set himself at liberty but he replied  that he would not be delivered by any power but by that which had committed him  After he had been in prison three years and a half the King gave him his liberty and knowing his worth and nice sense of honour took him into favour and delivered up to him all his estates The Earl took all occasions of relieving the oppressed subjects and was accounted one of the ablest and greatest men in the kingdom The Scots made an irruption into England and besieged Norham Castle the Earl raised the siege took the castle of Ayton and made all the country round a desert James IV of Scot∣land incensed at this sent a Herald with a challenge to him to which he made a sensible and spirited answer  that his life belonged to the King whilst he had the command of his army but when that was ended he would fight the King on horseback or on foot adding that if he took the King prisoner in the combat he would release him without any ransom and that if the King should vanquish him he would then pay such a sum for his liberty as was competent for the degree of an Earl  In the year the Earl was Lord High Treasurer In June Margaret the King's daughter a beautiful Princess at the age of years was attended by the Earl of Surry with a great company of Lords Ladies Knights and Esquires to the town of Berwick she was conveyed to St Lambert's church in Lamyr Moor where King James attended by the chief Nobility received her and carried her to Edinburgh The next day after her arrival there she was with great solemnity married unto him in the presence of all his Nobles The King gave great entertainments to the English whom the Scotch Noblemen and Ladies far outshone both in costly apparel rich jewels massive chains habiliments set with goldsmith's work garnished with pearl and stones of price and in gallant and welltrapped horses They made also great feasts for the English Lords and Ladies and shewed them justling and other pleasant pastimes as good as could be devised after the manner of Scotland Divers Ladies of Queen Margaret's train remained in Scotland and were after∣wards well married to Noblemen In two years before the death of King Henry VII the Earl was Ambassador to the King of France King Henry VIII he was made Earl Mar∣shal for life in he was one of the Commissioners at the Court of Arragon When King Henry VIII heard that the Scots were preparing to invade England he said  that he had left a Nobleman who would defend his subjects from insults  After the battle of Flodden the Earl himself presented King James's armour to the Queen Regent When the King re∣turned from France he gave the Earl an augmentation of his arms viz to bear on the bend the upper part of a red lion depicted in the same manner as the arms of Scotland pierced thro' the month with an arrow In the Earl was created Duke of Norfolk and a grant was given him in special tail of several manors He hated and opposed Cardinal Wolsey because he advised the King to pursue measures hurtful to the liberties of the people finding that his opposition prevailed nothing he resigned his post and retired from Court He died in the year  After these Lords were dead or fled  And companies left captainless  Their soldiers then did fly with speed  With souls of horror and distress  Whom Stanley with his total strength  Swiftly pursues unto the plain  Where on the King he light at length  Who fighting was with all his main  When his approach the King perceiv'd  With stomach stout he him withstood  His Scots right bravely then behav'd  And battle boldly there abode  Then showers of arrows fierce were shot  Which did each side so pierce and gall  That ere they came to handy strokes  Great numbers on the ground did fall  The King himself was wounded sore  An arrow in his forehead light  That he could scarce fight any more  The blood so blemished his fight  Fight on my men the King then said  Yet Fortune she may turn the scale  And for my wounds be not dismay'd  Nor ever let your courage fail  Thus dying did he brave appear  Till shades of death did close his eyes  Till then he did his soldiers cheer  And raise their courage to the skeys  But what avail'd his valour great  Or bold device 'twas all in vain  His Captains keen fell at his feet  And StandardBearer too was slain  The Archbishop of St Andrews brave  King James his son in base begot  That doleful day did death receive  With many a lusty lordlike Scot  Poem

the civil Law Latin Greek and Music The elegant pen of Erasmus who was one of his Preceptors at Siena in Italy has set his incomparable character in a most ami∣able  light By a dispensation from the Pope the King created him Archbishop of St Andrews and made him his Chancellor he was also made the Pope's Legate at Latere  It was not unusual in ancient times for the Dignitaries of the Church to attend their King in the wars they were bound to do it by the feudal law They held the temporalities of their benefices of the King as Barons by the tenure of military service It appears from many grants to the Clergy that according to the establishment of the church of Scotland the clerical and military character were not inconsistent King Edward III ordered all the Clergy to take up arms  two other Scotch Prelates four Abbots twelve Earls seventeen Lords four hundred Knights and seventeen thousand others among whom were many Esquires and men of note  When the Scotch King was perceived to be in imminent danger those near his person formed themselves in circular order and all fell by the sword except  Sir William Scott  his Chancellor and  Sir John Foreman  who were taken prisoners The royal body was not discovered till the next day when in a circle of his slain Nobility he was found by  Lord Dacres  who was well acquainted with his person After the royal re∣mains were removed to Berwick Sir William Scott Chancellor of Scot∣land and Sir John Foreman prisoners there acknowledged the body of their late Sovereign He was wounded in many parts pierced also by several arrows his left hand was almost severed from the arm by two several wounds and his neck was laid open to the middle How un∣fortunate was this race of Kings James I was murdered by the Earl of Athol his uncle in his palace James II died by the bursting of a piece of his own ordnance James III was slain by rebels headed by his own son James IV whose miserable death is above described His body was embalmed at Berwick and from thence conveyed to the monastery of  Sheene  where at the dissolution according to Stowe it remained uninterr'd and then thrown into a waste room among lumber  King James was killed in the th year of his reign and the th of his age He was of a majestic countenance of a middle size and a strong body By the use of exercise a slender diet and much watching he could easily bear the extremities of weather fatigue and scar∣city He excelled in fencing shooting and riding He delighted in fine horses the breed of which he endeavoured to propagate in his own country as it appears from several letters still extant which he wrote to the Kings of Spain and Poland entreating them that they would suffer his servants to buy such horses and mares as their respective dominions afforded In re∣turn he made them presents of hunting dogs and of the famous little ambling horses called galloways bred in the mountains and isles of Scotland About the year the Lord of Campvere sent him many fine large Flanders horses and also King Henry VII several fine horses and rich furniture He was of a quick wit which by the negligence of those times was uncultivated with letters He had great skill in the art of curing wounds which was then common to the Scotch Nobles always in arms He was of a high spirit of easy access cour∣teous and mild just in his judicial decisions merciful in his punishments which he inflicted upon offenders always unwillingly He was poor from his profusion in sumptuous buildings public shews entertainments and gifts  As long as he lived he wore an iron chain girdle to which he every year added one link in testimony of his sorrow for having appeared at the head of the rebels who killed his father contrary to his express orders Bishop Lesley concludes his Life of James with telling us that the Scotch nation lost in him a King most warlike just and holy Certain it is that he was so dear to his subjects that his death was more lamented than that of his predecessor ever was  He married Margaret the eldest daughter of King Henry VII by whom he left two sons the eldest not two years old About a year after King James's death she married Archibald Douglas Earl of Angus by whom she had a beautiful daughter Margaret born A D at Har∣bottle Castle in Northumberland afterwards the wife of Matthew Stewart Earl of Lenox and by him mother to Henry Lord

Scotland together with their daughter a Lady of great  beauty with whose charms the King was so fascinated as was before observed that for several days he desisted from all military advances even under the momentous circumstance of  the Earl of Surry  's hasty ap∣proach It was suspected by some according to Drummond p that  Surry  being acquainted with the King's amorous constitution

on the north side was a vault capable of receiving an hundred horses or other cattle  On a fine peninsula formed by the confluence of the Till and Tweed are the ruins of a small chapel called  St Cuthbert's Chapel  near which lie the remains of a stone boat or coffin ten feet long within and three and a half wide eighteen inches deep and four inches and a half thick it is of a singular form and a strange traditional history is told of it that St Cuthbert's remains not resting at  Norham  were carried to  Mailross  where shewing the same signs of agitation and restlessness as had occasioned former removals by a vision the attendants were ordered to pacify his impatient spirit by constructing a boat of stone in which the sacred relics floated down the Tweed miles to  Tilmouth  By some hydrostatical experiments it has been proved capable of floating and carrying the remains of the Saint These philosophical exhibitions in ages of profound ignorance among the vulgar were always esteemed miracles and food for superstition  It is said that not long ago there was a design to convert this hallowed vessel to mean offices a peasant having devised to pickle pork in it or thereout to feed his hogs to preserve it from such profanation the spirits of darkness brake it in the night leaving the fragments near the chapel  We passed under  TWIZEL CASTLE  built on a rocky

Ubbanford  said to be built by Egfrid Bishop of Lindisfarn in the year and gives the name of  Norhamshire  to a large tract of country a member of the county of Durham  Durham  is a  county palatine  by some authors it is said the power of the palatinate commenced soon after the Norman conquest but as no royal grant is to be found in the public repositories of records we may presume it is of greater antiquity The manors of  Norham  and  Holy Island  and also the manor of  Bedlington  commonly called  Bed∣lingtonshire  anciently have been and still continue parcels of the body of the said county palatine and the inhabitants resort to Durham for justice in all matters of law and civil jurisdiction as members of the palatinate Anciently  Norham Island  and  Bedlingtonshires  had several courts and officers of justice within their respective limits under the Commissions of the Bishop of Durham who held  Jura Regalia  within his See as Justices Sheriffs Escheators Coroners and other officers equally with the chief body of the county palatine laying between Tyne and Teese until by act of parliament in the th year of the reign of King Henry VIII many of these royal franchises and jurisdictions were resumed to the Crown  The royal remains of  Ceolwulf  were removed from Lindisfarn and deposited at  Norham  A part of the old church is standing and by some modern repairs is made

following remarks extracted from Symeon Dunelm and Hoveden  Egred of noble birth was consecrated Bishop of Holy Island A D he dedicated the church of Norham to the Saints Peter Cuthbert and Ceolwulf which he built together with the town and gave them both to the See of Holy Island he gave to it also the town of Jed∣burgh  in Tiviotdale with its appendages and the church and town of Gainforth and

King of  Northumberland  The former part of his reign was full of trouble afterwards in time of peace many Northumbrian nobles and private men with their King  Ceolwulf  turned Monks in the th year of his reign A D he quitted his crown for a cowl and entered the monastery of  Holy Island  to which place he carried his treasure leaving his kingdom to Eadbert his uncle's son He endowed the monastery

buried in that monastery but the abovementioned Bishop Egred took up his body and deposited it in the church of  Norham  His head was afterwards carried to the church at  Durham  The Monks of the cell of  Norham  in the following age called in the country to make their offerings at the shrine of their royal brother who always per∣formed some mighty miracle on his feastday  In the northern counties these  holy feasts  are not yet abolished and in the county of  Dur∣ham  many are yet celebrated they were originally feasts of  dedication  in commemoration of the consecration of the church in imitation of  Solomon  's great convocation at the consecrating the  Temple of Jerusalem  the religious tenor is totally forgotten and the Sabbath is made a day of every dissipation and vice which it is possible to conceive could crowd upon a villager's manners and rural life The manner of holding these  festivals  in former times was under tents or booths erected in the  Churchyard  where all kinds of diversions were introduced  Inter∣ludes  were there performed being a species of theatrical performance consisting of a rehearsal of some passage in holy writ personated by actors this kind of exhibition is spoken of by tra∣vellers who have visited  Jerusalem  where the religious even presume to exhibit the crucifixion and ascension with all their tremendous circumstances On these celebrations in this country great feasts were displayed and vast abundance of meat and drink From whence we adopted the custom is not ascertained but it seems probable and by some authors it is insisted upon that we had it in very great antiquity and derived it from the Easterns All their  Holydays  were distinguished by great  feasts  the celebrations we read of were performed with all the pomp of  procession  approaching the temple of the Gods with  offerings  in great magnificence and splendour where the cattle were consecrated and then delivered over to feast the multitude  The feast  of the translation of  St Cuthbert's body  is celebrated every year with great reverence by the inhabitants of  Norham  on the first Sunday and Monday after the th day of September O S  St Gregory  in his letter to  King Ethelbert  in the year had enjoined him to destroy the heathen idols their temples and high places that their influence might be taken away from the people and their memory effaced But on reviewing the estate of the inhabitants their superstitions and settled and habitual customs he thought it expedient not to pursue measures so violent and alarming at first and therefore in a letter wrote to  Mellitus  an Abbot who was upon his voyage to  Britain  he orders him upon his arrival to inform  Augustine  that on more mature deliberation he had resolved that the  Pagan temples  in Britain should not be pulled down it being sufficient that the  Idols  were taken away therefore  the places of the heathen worship  were to be purified with a libation of  holy water altars  were to be erected therein and  relics  placed under them for if these  temples  were well built it was fit the property of them should be altered the worship of Devils abolished and the solemnities changed to the service of the true God that when the natives perceived those religious structures remained standing they might keep to the place without retaining the error and be less shocked upon their first en∣trance upon christianity by frequenting the  temples  they had been used to esteem And his injunctions were that since it had been their  custom  to sacrifice oxen to the Devils they adored this usage ought to be refined on and altered to an innocent practice He recommends that on  the anniversary of the Saints  whose  relics  are lodged there or upon the return of the day on which  the church was consecrated  the people should erect booths about the churches lately rescued from idolatry provide a  feast  and keep  a christian holiday  not sacrificing their cattle to evil spirits but killing them for their own refreshment and praising God for the blessing and thus by allowing them sensual gratifications they may relish christianity the better and be raised by degrees to the more noble pleasures of the mind for unpolished and ignorant peo∣ple are not to be withdrawn from their habits all at once God when he discovered himself to the  Israelites  in  Egypt  did not forbid them the customary rites of  sacrificing  but purified the service to himself Greg Epist Lib Epist Thus the Pope thought it expedient to bend to the prejudices of the new converts as a

The dispute remaining unsettled each Monarch again prepared for war but a second interposition of the Nobility occa∣sioned  them to hold another conference at  Norham  in the same year when a treaty of peace was concluded between William King of Scot∣land and King John in which John stipulated not to erect any fortress at Tweedmouth William on the other hand depositing a large sum of money as restitution for the ravages he had committed on the English borders  In the year the two Kings held another conference at  the castle of Norham  at which Ermengard Queen of Scotland was present and by her amiable conduct greatly promoted the treaty on which the So∣vereigns had met Here the terms of the former peace were ratified and several new articles agreed to  In the year King John in the utmost terror of an insurrection of his subjects and an invasion from France in consequence of the pa∣pal interdict which had been pronounced came again to  Norham  earnest to secure the amity of Scotland William the Scotch King then lay dangerously ill and was not able to proceed further than Haddington on his engagement to meet the King of England Highly chagrined at this disappointment he returned southward and it was not long before his sentence of deposition was pronounced his kingdom given to the king of France and a croisade published against his territories by the Emissaries of the See of Rome Driven to dreadful dilemma's John was at length obliged to make his peace with the Holy See the interdict which had continued six years was revoked and the lands of those who had adhered to the papal authority against their Sove∣reign and had been pronounced forfeitures to the Crown of which those of Eustace de Vesey were part were restored Soon after this event succeeded that glorious combination of the Barons under which  the great charter  and  charter of the forests  were obtained from the re∣luctant hands of this miserable tyrant  To those patriots whose names ought to be engraven on the hearts of every Briton we owe every thing valuable upon earth the liberty we possess and our authentic right to the properties we enjoy  To men of the North the memory of  Eustace de Vesey Richard de Percy Robert de Ros Peter de Bruis Nicholas D'Es∣toutesille William de Moubrai  and  Oliver de Vaux  northern Barons in this combination should be immortal  By Hemingford and under his authority by Knighton it is alledged that the violations and injuries the Barons had sustained as well touch∣ing  their liberties and properties as in their private and family con∣cerns urged them to appear more readily in the promotion of this great work the necessity for which had indeed long been experienced The base tyrant was not content with public oppressions but in his mean∣ness of vice even descended to the violation of the wives and daughters of his Barons to which purpose he practised the vilest artifices He had by stratagem possessed himself of the signet of  Eustace de Vesey  by means of which he attempted to delude his Lady that he might vio∣late her chastity Vesey by a happy discovery gained a knowledge of the King's intentions and concerting measures with the Lady had address enough to put a common prostitute into the arms of the tyrant and preserve the honour of his family Exulting in the success of his project and amidst the fervour of a generous resentment he reproached the King to his face with his baseness reviled him for the possession of a strumpet and defied his wrath  But to return to the history of NorhamWilliam King of Scotland dying was succeeded by his son Alexander II a youth not more than years of age The Barons of Northumberland had recourse to him for protection and thereupon paid their homage at  Felton  This in∣censed King John so much that he prepared for a northern expedition In the Year King Alexander came before  Norham  with a mighty army and after an investiture for days was obliged to raise the siege This circumstance is thus mentioned in Leland's Collectanea v p  Alexander King of Scottes sun to King William did entre ynto England and did much despite to King John he assegid the castel of Mitteford and  Norham  and toke homages  In King Henry III had projected a scheme for surprizing Alexander III King of Scotland and rescuing him from the govern∣ment of those who had taken him from those ministers approved of by King Henry The government of the castles of  Norham  and  Wark  was conferred on Robert de Neville Lord of Raby whose commission from King Henry was  to provide himself with horse and arms to march with the forces designed to rescue Alexander from the restraint in which his rebellious subjects held him  Dugdale's Peerage vol  But this project was ren∣dered abortive by the assembling of a great army of Scots in the forest  of Jedburgh and a treaty ensued This  Robert de Neville  was the se∣cond Lord of Raby of the name of Neville being the grandson of Robert Fitz Maldred Lord of Raby who was the lineal male heir of Uchtred Earl of Northumberland  A convention was appointed to be held at  Norham  on the th day of May previous to King Edward the First's entering upon a de∣cision of the claims made by the several competitors for succession to the Crown of Scotland on the death of Margaret of Norway the in∣fant heiress The assembly that day is said to be held in the parish church of Norham when were present the King and many Nobles and Prelates of both nations The King declared that the purpose of his coming was in quality of Superior and direct Lord of Scotland to maintain the tranquillity of that kingdom and to do impartial justice to those who laid claim to the Crown but previous thereto he demanded their recognition of such his pretended sovereignty and it is alledged that his claim was historically deduced with great skill and artifice by  Anthony Beck  then Bishop of Durham after which three weeks were given for the Scotch Nobles to deliberate on the demand On the d day of June then next eight competitors with several of the Prelates Nobles and Community of Scotland appeared and held their council on this important matter  Congregatis ex opposito castri de Norham ex alia parte fluminis Tweedae in quadam arda viridi  Rot Turri  when all the competitors made the required recognition and absolute submission of their several claims and pretended right to the Scottish Crown to his decision  On the same day the competitors together with the whole company came to the King in the church of  Norham  and several subsequent meetings were held there for settling preliminaries and the second day of the succeeding August was appointed for hearing all claimants at Berwick  After judgment was given at Berwick in favour of John Baliol on the th of November he swore fealty to King Edward in the castle of  Norham  in the presence of many Nobles of both nations and a commission was thence issued for enthroning him at Scone  In the following reign in the year it was besieged by the Scots Sir Thomas Grey being then Governor  In Leland's Collectanea we have the following curious particulars of this siege  The Scottes came yn to the Marches of England and destroyed the castels of Werk and Herbotel and overran much of Northumberland Marches  "At this tyme Thomas Gray and his friends defended Norham from the Scottes"  It were a wonderful processe to declare what mischefes cam by hungre and asseges by the space of XI yeres in Northumberland for the Scottes became so proude after they got Ber∣wick that they nothing esteemed the Englishmen  About this tyme there was a great feste made yn Lincolnshir to which came many Gentle∣men and Ladies and among them a Lady brought a heanlme for a man of were with a very rich creste of gold to William Marmion Knight with a letter of commandment of her Lady that he should go into the daungerest place in England and there to let the heanlme to be seene and knowne as famous So he went to Norham whither within dayes of cumming cam Philip Moubray Guardian of Berwicke having in his band men of armes the very flour of men of the Scottish Marches  Thomas Gray Capitayne of Norham seying this brought his garison afore the bariers of the castel behynde whom cam William richly arrayed as al glittering in gold and wear∣ing the heanlme as his Lady's present  Then sayd Thomas Gray to Marmion "Sir Knight ye be cum hither to fame your heanlme mount upon your horse and ryde like a valiant man to yown even here at hand and I forsake God if I rescue not thy body deade or alyve or I myself will dye for it"  Whereupon he took his cursore and rode among the throng of enemyes the which layd sore stripes on hym and pulled hym at the last oute of his sadel to the ground  Then Thomas Gray with all the hole garrison lette pryk yn among the Scottes and so wondid them and their horses that they were overthrowen and Marmion sore beten was horsid agayn and with Gray persewid the Scottes in chase There were taken horses of price and the women of Norham brought them to the foote men to follow the chase  Sir Thomas Gray hymselfe killed one Cryne a Fleming an Admiral and great robber on the se and yn hy favor with Robert Bruse the residew that escaped were chased to the Nunnes of Berwick  Adam de Gordon a Baron of Scotland came with men to dryve away the cattel pasturing by Norham but the young men of the country thereaboute encountered with them whom Thomas Gray seing to stand in jepardy wente oute with only men and killed most parte of the Scottes and their horses  The same Thomas was twise assiged yn the castel of Norham by the Scottes one tyme by the space almost of an yere the other monithes his enuemies made fortresses before the castel one at Upsedlington another yn the church of Norham This castel was twise vi∣tailied by the Lord Percy and Neville that he came with very noble men and rich and great socorers of the Marches of England  The utter ward of Norham Castel was ons taken in Thomas Gray's tyme on the vigill of St Catherine but they kept yt by days for theyr purpose in myning fayllied them  by whose brave de∣fence and the timely aid of the Lords Percy and Nevil it was pre∣served from the hands of the enemy In order to carry on the siege the Scots raised two forts against the castle one at the church of Nor∣ham and the other at Upsitlington On a succeeding siege in the Scots became masters of this fortress but held it not long for King Edward retook it after an assault of ten days he having brought before it a very powerful army  In on the night of King Edward the Third's coronation the Scots made an assault on the castle Robert Manners then Governor had received previous intimation of the intended attempt and permit∣ting of the assailants to scale the outward wall put them to the sword  In soon after their march from Weardale in the county of Durham the Scots laid siege to  Norham  and took it by storm Three Knights of great military fame in the Scotch army fell in the attack William de Montalt or Montraud  Robert Bruce King of Scotland had assegid the castel of Norham wher Robert Maners was Capytane which with his garrison issuid oute one day and discomfited the Scottes kill∣ing William Monhaud a Baron of ScotlandLel Coll v p  John de Clapham and Mailis de Dobery Another party made an unsuccessful attempt on the castle of Alnwick near the same time In a party of Scots under the command of Sir William Ramsay burnt and plundered the town of Norham and adjacent country  In the th year of the reign of King Henry VII the Scots led by King James in person besieged  Norham Castle  which had been put into good repair by Fox then Bishop of Durham and was well garrisoned The Bishop came in person to its succour the besieged making a va∣liant defence Many of the outworks were destroyed Some authors assert the Scotch did not raise the siege till the Earl of Surry with an army of men came to its support and obliged the assailants to retire In the th year of the reign of King Henry VIII  the castle  was assaulted by the Scots previous to the battle of  Flodden Field  We have this mentioned in the poem of the battle of Flodden part fit line  It was the King's express command  To waste with cruel sword and flame  A field of blood he made the land  'Till he to Norham Castle came    Which soon with siege he did beset  And trenches digged without delay  With bombard shot the walls he beat  And to assault it did essay    The Captain great with courage stout  His fortress fiercely did defend  But for a while he lashed out  'Till his ordnance did spend    His powder he did profusely waste  His arrows he hailed out every hour  So that he wanted at the last  And at the last had none to pour    But yet five days he did defend  Though with assaults they him assail'd  Though all their strength they did extend  Yet all their power had not prevailed    Had not there been a traiterous thief  Who came King James's face before  That in that hold had got relief  The space of thirty years and more  * * * * * * *  * * * * * * *    O King quoth he now quit this place  And down to yonder vallies draw  The walls then shall you rend and raze  Your batteries will bring them low    Which as he said so did the King  And against the walls his ordnance bent  It was a wretched dismal thing  To see how soon the walls were rent    Which made the Captain sore afraid  Beholding the walls how they reeled  His weapons all then down he laid  And to King James did humbly yield  * * * * * *    So when the Scots the walls had won  And rifled every nook and place  The traitor came to the King anon  But for reward met with disgrace  * * * * * *    Therefore for this thy traiterous trick  Thou shall be tried in a trice  Hangman therefore quoth he be quick  The groom shall have no better place  The Battle of Flodden  The King by the advice of this traitor descended from  Lady Kinkbank  into the flat ground near the Tweed now called the  Gin Haugh  whence with his cannon he threw down the north east corner of the castle wall a large fragment of which now lies by the side of the river Bishop Tunital in Queen Elizabeth's time rebuilt the wall this is now very distinguishable from the old work There is a field near the castle in which this traitor was hanged now called Hangman's Land This fact is not mentioned by the Historians By the account of it in the poem we shall more readily understand the following epigram of Sir Thomas More Lord High Chancellor in the time of King Henry VIII  In Regem Scotiae qui arcem Norhamam proditam sibi tamen oppugnavit dissimulans pro∣ditam esse  Scote quid oppugnas Norhamam viribus arcem  Ante tibi falsa proditione datam  Artibus ergo malis captâ fuit arce voluptas  Magna tibi forsan sed brevis illa fuit  Teque tuisque malâ meritâ sed morte peremptis  Arx intra est paucos capta recepta dies  Proditor inque tuo peteret cum praemia regno  Mors sceleri est merces reddita digna suo  Proditor ut pereat pereat cui proditor hostis  Invicta in satis arx habet ista suis  I take this to be the meaning of the two last verses which are the most difficultThere is a tradition here that the King was told where the castle wall was weakest by a letter fixed to an arrow shot over the Tweed into his camp  Lamb's Notes to the Poem of the Battle of Flodden  and part of the outworks were destroyed  In order to entertain a just idea of those conflicts on the borders I will extract from the letters of the Commanders in the year a  short state of their progress and proceedings in the Mers and Tiviot∣dale The progress of the Berwick garrison was as far as Dunglass the garrisons of Wark and Cornhill proceeded as far as the hills of Lammar Muir and over the dry March of Tiviotdale The chief Com∣manders were Sir George Bowes Sir Brian Laiton and Sir Ralph Eure On the th of July Bowes Laiton and others burnt Dunse the chief town of the Mers and John Carr's son with the garrison of Cornhill Castle entered Greenlaw and carried off a booty of cattle sheep and horses On the th of the same month the men of Tyndale and Ridsdale returning from a road into Tiviotdale fought with the Laird of Ferniherst and his followers and took him and his son John prisoners On the th of July the garrison of Wark the Captain of Norham and Henry Eure burnt Long Edmin made many prisoners and took a bastellhouse strongly kept and got a booty of nolt and horses besides those on which their prisoners were mounted each on a horse On the d of August the Captain of Norham burnt the town of Home near to the castle gates with the surrounding steads Sept th Sir Ralph Eure burnt Eikford church and town the barnekin of Ormeston and won by assault the Moss Tower burnt it and slew people within it he likewise burnt several other places in that neigh∣bourhood and carried off more than nolt and sheep with  horse load of spoils got in the tower Sept th the men of the east and part of the middle March won the church of Eccles by assault and slew men in the abbey and town most part gentlemen of head sirnames they also took prisoners and burnt the abbey and town On the same day the garrison of Berwick brought out of the east end of the Mers bolls of corn and took prisoner Patrick Home brother's son to the Laird of Aiton November th the men of the middle March burnt Lussedden in which were strong bastell houses slew several of the owners and burnt much corn November th Sir George Bowes and Sir Brian Laiton burnt Dryburgh a market town all ex∣cept the church with much corn and brought away nolt nags sheep and much other booty spoilage and insight gear  The whole number of towns towers steads barnekins parish churches and bastell houses seized destroyed and burnt in all the border country was Scots slain prisoners taken nolt sheep nags and geldings gayts bolls of corn insight gear an indefinite quantity  In Hertford's expedition places burnt rased and cast down among these Dunse the abbey and town of Eccles the tower and bar∣nekin of Nisbit the towers of Dunse Redbraes Pollard and Merting∣ton with the castles of Wedderburn and Blackadder were rased On the river Tweed from Kelso upwards places were destroyed among which were the abbey of Kelso the abbey and town of Dryburgh the abbey of Mailross and the towers of Dawcove and Stotherick on the river Tiviot among which were the friars near Kelso the towers of Roxburgh and Ormeston and the two towers of Boon Jedburgh places on the Rowle Water on Jed among which the abbey friars and town of Jedburgh places on the Kayle and between it and the Tweed on Bowbent alias Bowmont The sum total of the places destroyed or laid waste in the whole inroad was of which mo∣nasteries and friar houses castle towers and piles market towns villages mills spitals and hospitals  In the d year of the reign of King Henry VIII  Norham  was sur∣prized by the Scotch and soon after recovered by one Franklin Arch∣deacon of Durham  In the year a treaty was signed in the church of Norham the Scotch Commissioners were Robert Bishop of Orkney Robert Lord Max∣well  Thomas Master of Erskine and Louis de St Gelais Lord of Lansac Knt those for England were Thomas Bishop of Norwich Robert Bowes Leonard Beckwith and Thomas Chaloner Knt  In  the castle of Norham  which from the time of Bishop Flam∣bert had appertained to the See of Durham appears from Lord Whar∣ton's proposals for the better protection of the Marches to be vested in the Crown The deprivation of Cuthbert Tunstal happened on the th of October in this year soon after the accession of Queen Mary before which time we have no public record to shew how Norham might come into the power of the Crown The infamous law for the dissolution of the bishopric is the first act of any notoriety I have been able to discover which could effect the matter and notwithstanding that law it appears from several records that in the reign of Queen Mary the castle was repaired and again fortified by Bishop Tunstal and that some very short time before his death in the year he held a treaty there with the Scotch when were present Thomas Earl of Northumberland William Lord Dacres of Gilsland and Croft Com∣mander of the fortress of Berwick on the behalf of the English and for Scotland the Earls of Morton and Hume with the Dean of Glasgow  Camden describes  Norham Castle  in his time  to be situate on the top of a high steep rock and fortified with a trench the outward wall of great circuit was guarded by several turrets in a canton towards the river in which another wall much stronger encircled the keep or tower of great height  This description gives a perfect idea of its figure after the repairs made by Bishop Tunstal Towards the river the ruins now hang upon the very verge of the precipice part of which by the washing of the torrent has given way and carried with it the superstructure on that side which with the decay incident to the length of time has occasioned a wide breach in the outward wall spoken of by Camden the turrets as he is pleased to stile them appear to be no other than demibastions a mode of fortification peculiar to the age in which this erection arose a perfect model of which still in good preservation appears at  Hartlepool  in the county of Durham of near the same date being the palatinate port of the bishopric  The wall of the castle of Norham which extended from the water on the south side was guarded with a gateway and tower having square turrets on each side and thence ascending the steeps stretching  eastward was also defended by another gateway of superior dimen∣sions fortified by two heavy round flanking towers the remains of which are still considerable This appears to be the chief entrance and fronts a plain of considerable extent it was defended by a draw bridge over a very wide moat which began here and was extended round the land side of the castle enclosing a spacious area or ballium with a very strong wall garnished with demibastions at intervals Within the area of this outward wall are the remains of a chapel and several other structures To defend the keep or main tower a very strong wall encloses a narrow area or interior ballium which is entered by a gate∣way guarded on each hand by square towers The keep is a very large heavy square building vaulted underneath like most structures of this kind Part of the vaults and some of the prisons remain entire but all the interior parts of the tower above are laid open and demo∣lished The remains of an exploratory turret are seen on one corner of the keep it may be presumed it was originally uniform bearing a turret at each corner The height of the great tower is about feet containing four stories or ranges of apartments The whole build∣ing is constructed of red freestone of a soft nature and subject to decay There is not the least ornament about it and the whole aspect is gloomy to the greatest degree it wears the countenance of the times of King Stephen without any embellishments of the age in which Bishop Tunstal lived  This has been a very formidable fortress inaccessible from the Tweed and before the use of fire arms from its present remains ap∣pears impregnable if fully garrisoned and duly provided with stores against a siege When the outward walls were in repair and filled with troops when the oillets and other devices for the garrison's fighting and defence were properly supplied with experienced archers and the bastions were kept by men of valour it seems almost incredible that this place could ever be taken by assault But when there was a re∣gular blockade and time for mining and raising engines the defence then consisting of different manoeuvres would consequently harrass the most powerful garrison frequent sallies becoming necessary by which the troops are exposed to the superior numbers of besiegers incessant watchings and severe duties wear down the greatest fortitude of soul and scarcity of provision with perpetual anxiety subdue the most vigo∣rous heart Such are the calamities of a siege and such were many times experienced here but of all the distresses the valiant know none  equals that which proceeds from a defection in his partizans and the corruption of his colleagues So prone is the human heart to evil that we find in the history of every state and people such horrid tales of treachery that the stain upon the human character leaves so disagree∣able a sentiment upon the mind of the reader as with its bitterness and gall almost overwhelms the pleasures we receive by the images of virtue I forbear to search into this part of the history of Norham  A fishery in Tweed near the castle called Hallywell for one night and one day ad∣judged by Commissioners to settle claims on the borders to be the inheritance of Lord Hume  A mile below Norham the Tweed forms an island of acres near a place called St Thomas's Den  A little to the west a lofty terrace on the banks where the Tweed forms a serpentine canal The seat of James Ker  Esq  of Ker'sfield on the other side  Further down the river is the pedestal of a cross with some of its fragments and about yards further in a direct line another with steps round it a place of sepulchre or barrow Crosses were erected by the road side leading from Tilmouth chapel to Norham  Wallis  The castle with its demesnes consisting of acres are now the property of Robert Fenwick of Lemington  Esq  In right of his wife one of the daughters and coheirs of William Ord  Esq  of Sandy Bank  held by payment of a castle rent to Sir Thomas Haggerston Lord of the Manor of  Norham  Richard Barnes Bishop of Durham severed this demesne and castle from his See by grant to Queen Elizabeth by whom it was given to the Earl of Monmouth and passed from him by sale  George Charleton born at Norham bred in Oxford was one of the four Divines sent by King James to the Synod of Dort He was Bishop of Landaff afterwards of Chichester a man of good affections solid judgment and clear invention He wrote amongst others two Treatises called  A thankful Remembrance of God's Mercy and a Confutation of Judicial Astrology  When young he was grave in his manners so when old he was youthful in his parts even to his death which happened in the st of King Charles  All the banks of the Tweed afford the same cultivated scenes down to Berwick almost naked of wood and consisting of wide enclosures On the environs of Berwick we first lost sight of the Helton Mountains adjoining to Mailross  The village of  TWEEDMOUTH  situate at the south end of Berwick bridge is noted for the assembly of Barons and others in the th year of the reign of King Edward I An ancient hospital dedicated to St Bartholomew stood here  The access to  BERWICK  is by a fine stone bridge of arches built in the reign of Queen Eliza∣beth A bridge of wood was carried away by the floods in the reign of King John and was restored by William King of Scotland In Le∣land's Collectanea this event is thus mentioned  The bridge of Ber∣wike brake aboute this tyme with great force of water

heaps of foundations stood to the northwest of the present town much of its strength seems to have consisted in the elevation and mount on which it was erected The present heaps and lines of ruins merit no description their extent and situation remain to point out the ancient strength of this important fortress now moulder∣ing under the wrath of Time and prostrate with the earth  Monsieur Jorvin wrote a description of England and Scotland pub∣lished at Paris A D which the editor of the Antiquarian Reper∣tory thought worth inserting in that work the account given of Ber∣wick and the adjoining country contains several particulars which claim a place here  Barrwick is the first town by which I reentered England and be∣ing a frontier to England has been fortified in different manners there is in it at present a large garrison as in a place of importance to this kingdom It is bounded by the river Tweed which empties itself into the sea and has a great reflux capable of bringing up large vessels was it not prevented by sands at the entrance into its port I arrived here about ten of the clock on a Sunday the gates  were then shut during church time but were opened at eleven as is the custom in all fortified places  Here is an upper and a lower town  which are both on the side of a hill that slopes towards the river  On its top there is a ruined and abandoned castle although its situation makes it appear impregnable it is environed on one side by the ditch of the town on the other side by one of the same breadth flanked by many round towers and thick walls which enclose a large palace in the middle of which rises a lofty keep or donjon capable of a long resistance and com∣manding all the environs of the town  The high town encloses within its walls and ditches those of the lower from which it is only separated by a ditch filled with water In the upper town the streets are straight and handsome but there are not many rich inhabitants they rather preferring the lower town in which there are  many great palaces  similar to that which has been built near the great church and  in all the open areas are great fountains  and in one of them the guard house and public parade before the town hall or sessions house over which is the clock tower of the town so that by walking over Barwick I discovered it to be  one of the greatest and most beautiful towns in England  The greatest part of the streets in the lower town are either up or down hill but they are filled with many rich Merchants on account of the convenience and vicinity of its port bordered by a large quay along which the ships are ranged There is not a stone bridge in all England longer or better built than that of Barwick which has large and wonderfully well wrought arches  it is considered as one of the most remarkable curiosities of the kingdom  I passed over it in leaving the place adjoining to it is a large suburb  from whence the country is covered with heath and briars to Ashton  where there is a castle Bowk∣lin where the sea appears on the left and a small island not far off which forms a pretty good harbour near a village having a castle All this sea coast is covered with sand banks  and the interior country to Belford an entire desert as it is far above    miles round about  being only fitted for feeding cattle occasioned by divers rivulets which run through meadow where great herds of all sorts of cattle may be seen feeding  The town of Berwick  lays on the inclination of an easy slope towards the river most of the buildings are ancient and make but a mean ap∣pearance  the streets are narrow except that only in which the town house is placed The fortifications are modern and said to be excel∣lent being constructed agreeable to the modes adopted since the use of cannon In the year these new works were begun by which the ancient fortification was greatly reduced for this purpose many houses were taken down and a tower which stood in a street called  Hide hill  the ancient chief fortress or castle which adjoined to the southwest corner of the old town wall was left at the distance of se∣veral hundred yards from the modern works Camden speaking of Ber∣wick says it is "Munitissimum totius Brittaniae oppidum" The man∣ner of fortifying with bastions was a French device begun in the time of Francis I and Charles V or at the soonest of Louis XIIThe Lord Grey of Wilton was the first that bore the title of Governor of Berwick in commission There are excellent barracks for the garrison the building plain and neat consisting of a center and two wings The public walk is on the rampier where the gaity of the inhabitants is chiefly displayed and to which the soldiery contribute greatly The church is a neat plain structure built in the time of Cromwell and consequently without a steeple  Colonel George Fenwick of Brinkburn under parliament superintended the work He lays buried in the church under the following epitaph  Col Geo Fenwick of Brenkburn  Esq  Governour of Berwick In the year was a principal Instru∣ment of causing this Church to be built And died March th A good man is a public good  he forming much of his

of Richard Fishborn  Esq  dated March wherein he left them the sum of l The tower of the town house which is a spacious handsome building contains a good set of bells The country north of Berwick is open and little cultivated and within a few miles rises in lofty and barren hills The town stands on  a point of land exposed to the sea on the east and northeast and to a strong channel of air from the west which follows the course of the river so that consequently the situation is very cold  Berwick  was for ages a scene of war and bloodshed every step the tra∣veller takes upon its confines or in its boundary is imprinted on earth stained with human gore  It may be acceptable to the reader to find here a state of the antient Border Laws as set forth in Ridpath's Border History collected as the editor of that work asserts from a manu∣script copy in the Advocates Library in Edinburgh which differs considerably from the copy of them published by Dr Nicholson and is much superior to the mixed Code of Laws in Nichol∣son's and Burn's History of Cumberland lately published in which we are not left to judge for ourselves but must place an implicit confidence in the compilers for its accuracy and propriety  About three months before the death of Alexander the d King of Scotland a meeting was held on the Marches of England and Scotland for ascertaining the laws of those Marches and enforcing their observation This work was committed to Knights  The names of the English Knights were Robert de Clifford Robert son of Ralph Robert Mallfant Robert de Ulfeston William de Burnville

Sheriff of Northumberland for the King of England and of the Sheriffs of Roxburgh and Berwick for the King of Scotland by which Sheriffs the Knights were sworn to make a faithful inquest and report

Totness in England and Caithness in Scotland might agreeably to the customs of both kingdoms be justly called the Marches to decide their quarrels by combat excepting the persons of the Kings themselves and of the Bishops of St Andrews' and Dunkeld  III It was further unanimously declared that if any vassal or bondsman in Scotland should with or without his goods fly into England with the intention of escaping from his Lord and if within days after he should be pursued by his Lord's Bailiff the fugitive should be brought back to Scotland on the oath of the pursuer without any opposition from the English the same being understood to hold with regard to fugitives from England But if the fugitive was not pursued before days were elapsed his Lord could not recover him without a brief from the sovereign of the kingdom where he remained and on his being dis∣covered there  In Reg  ex quo exiverit  in printed copy in MS  regno inquo extiterit  after the expiration of days  An exception is made  nisi fuera nativus  not translated does it mean that these oaths were unnecessary where the fugitive was a bondsman  his Lord might seize him upon giving his own oath accompanied by the oath of six others  IV Moreover it was found that if any of the rank of a bondsman  Si Nativus aliquis  Nativus is here rendered according to its usual signification in the laws and deeds of that time but  native  seems to be the juster term  of the one kingdom had delivered pledges for a debt he owed in the other he might  recover these pledges  within thrice days  upon finding sureties for payment one out of each kingdom  Namos suos replegiabit per Inbrocht wood et utbrotcht wood  MS  Wred Wred  is a surety  Inbrotcht et utbrotcht na∣tivos et extraneos  Not in Nicholson  and pay the sum itself within days immediately following But if the sum was not then paid the creditor might seize the pledge of his debtor and detain it until he received full satisfaction for the debt owing him But if the debtor denied his debt he was obliged to purge himself of it on the Marches within the first succeeding days by the oaths of seven  Cum septima manu This interpretation is given upon a presumption that the meaning is the same here with what is more fully expressed in the conclusion of the former article by these words  per Jurameatum sex Virorum et se septimo et per sacramentum sex Virorum et se septimo  In Art VIII  his own included And this was also to be understood of the surety when the creditor could not be found but if he con∣fessed his debt and had no goods wherewith to pay it he was obliged to declare himself not possessed of goods exceeding the value of five shillings and fourpence and must further swear that he will pay the said debt as he may be able to acquire or gain the means of paying it re∣serving only his own sustenance  V In the next place they found that all climants on either side should in person give their oaths in support of their claims with the exception only of the two Kings and their Heirs and the Bishops of St Andrews' and Dunkeld The person who ought to swear in the place of the King of England was his standard bearer and the constable of his army on the other hand the Priest of  Wredale  Wredale  Vallis Doloris  Ford is the same with Stow so Mill is the description of  Mellrose  was to swear for the King of Scotland and the Bishop of St Andrews' and the Prior of the Isle for the Bishop of Dunkeld  Prior de Insala  probably of  Lockleven  where the Convent was governed by a  Prior  The head of the Convent at  Inchcalm  was an  Abbot  Spotswood If instead of  Dunkeld Durham  is to be read the  Prior de Insula  will be the Prior of  Holy Island    VI It was further declared that no person beside these had a right to depute  Facere Attornatum  another to swear for him in any quarrel touching life or limb unless such deputation was made with consent of both parties but without this consent the failure of either in appearing in person to give his oath lost him his cause for ever  Ita pro uno solo Defectu  VII They next found that if there were any plea on the Marches between a plaintiff and a defendant that affected life or limbs and if the defendant happened to die within the days preceding the day of trial his body should be carried to the Marches at the time and to the place appointed between the parties because  no man can be essoigned by death  Again when the appellant delayed his appearance beyond the appointed day the defendant  The word  defendant  is not in the original but the sense seems necessarily to require its being understood  ought to pass to the Marches and obtain an attestation  Accipere Manum de Wardshiel  Wardshiel MS Hame Wardshiel I do not understand This seventh is a very obscure article and it is doubtful if the translation expresses its exact meaning  from three Barons witnessing that he had regu∣larly made his appearance on the day prefixed and this being attested by them he was to be in all time coming free from challenge in that case but if any or all of these Barons refused to give testimony of the above fact he might oblige them to decide the truth of this charge by a combat and the same rule was to hold with regard to the appellant  VIII It was also found that if any Scottish robber stole in England an horse oxen or cows or any other thing and carried the goods stolen into Scotland the person whose pro∣perty they were wherever he discovered them might in the Court  From this it is probable there were not at that time any Warden Courts  of the Lords in whose  lands he found the stolen goods and should there recover them by his own oath and the oath of six persons besides unless the person possessing the goods affirms them to be his own in which case the question must be decided by a combat on the Marches  IX The next article fixed was that in any trial on the Marches that affected life or limb as for robbery theft or murder where the defendant was convicted by the issue of a com∣bat his sureties ought not to be answerable for a greater sum than the plaintiff mentioned in his charge But  From this to the end of the article from the MS in the Advocates Library  if a person accused was convicted of slaying a man and his sureties were dead he was obliged to make good the forfeiture  Resp  debit die de monteple    The learned Sir James Foulis of Collington gave the Editor the following proba∣ble meaning of the word  montoplen  I take  mont  plen  to be a contraction for  manto plenitudine  a barbarous law term to express the full time of waiting Manto is a contracted word for  mansito  the frenquentative of  manco  so  respen  ebit de manto plenitudine  is that he shall answer when the full time of waiting is expired that is when the legal term comes  if his own money and that of his sureties together with the produce of their corns exposed to sale were sufficient for that purpose the lives of different ranks of men at that time being appretiated and if the sureties were not dead and the accused was convicted by combat all the goods he possessed at the time of at∣tacking him ought to incur forfeiture to the pursuer But  Debout se purgare tanquam exeuntes de Carcere quibus Plegius defuerit  all such persons ought to purge themselves in the same manner as those who having no sureties are suffered to go out of prison  X It was next declared that if a malefactor passing from one district or province of the kingdom into which he had entered into another desired to obtain protection  Hebere voluerit Pacem  The article is  si aliquis malefactor existens in una Regione in altera Parte  MS alteram Partem  regei in quo intravit habere volueris Pacem  c perhaps it may be understood of a malefactor passing over the March that divides the counties from one kingdom to the other and the sense according to this interpretation seems better Probably the text is corrupt  he should re∣ceive it from those having power to grant it viz from the Sheriff of the county into which he had entered and if he could not find the Sheriff he might obtain peace at the first church by ringing the bells and should remain in peace there until protection was granted by the Sheriff but if before thus obtaining his peace he was attacked he might be brought back without any opposition  XI It was further agreed that if any inhabitant of either kingdom affirmed in opposition to a claimant of the other that a horse ox cow or hog in his possession was his own he should have the usual respite of days established between the kingdoms  Habebit Di  ti  e omnes inter regna Statutes ut ultimas Dies Litis  before the matter was brought to a trial And on the day fixed for that if he chose to avoid a combat and knew that the thing was not his own he was obliged to bring it to the Marches and inform the op∣posite party that he was satisfied upon enquiry that the horse c was the property of that party and after this declaration he was bound to drive it into the water of Tweed or Esk and the defendant should then be free from the claim or challenge brought against him But if it was drowned before it reached the mid stream of the water  So rendered in MS translation mentioned by Dr Nicholson  the defendant ought accord∣ing to the custom of the Marches to be still answerable for it and this extended to an ox cow or swine or other things only nothing was established about a load  De Sar      XII They further agreed that no inhabitant  Quod cullus de Reg  Anglie potest probare aliquam Rem aliquiem Reum  in printed copy  de Regno Scotiae per Testes  verse nisi tantum  do per Corpus Hominis  of either kingdom could prove his property in any thing possessed by an inhabitant of the other by witnesses but solely by the body of a man  e By his own body or that of his champion in combat a combat of this kind on the Marches was called  by a particular name  Acra  in a remonstrance of the clergy of England presented to the Legate Otho in for procuring redress from the King of several encroachments on their liberties they complain of an abuse arising from an establishment of the Kings of England and Scotland by which not only simple Clerks but also Abbots and Priors in the diocese of Carlitle when challenged for any thing by an inhabitant or subject of Scotland or recipro∣cally were compelled to fight with spears and swords a combat called Aera on the confines of the two kingdoms inter fores utriusque regni so that the Abbot or Prior of whatever religion or order was obliged either to a personal combat or to have a champion to combat for him and if this champion was defeated the Abbot or Prior was to undergo capital punishment of which there had been a recent instant in the Prior of Lidely The clergy suppli∣cated the Legate to admonish or if admonitions could not prevail to employ his Legative authority to compel the Kings not to suffer so detestable an abuse to be extended to ecclesiastical persons  whence many combats must needs ensue from the strifes that arose from time to time on the Marches  XIII They further agreed that any person in their kingdom pursuing for the recovery of a debt due to him in the other ought according to the laws of the Marches if the person in∣debted to him were a Clerk to seek justice  Clericos inde monere  MS manare  from the Clerks if a Knight from the Knights and if a Burgess from the Burgesses by which classes alone judgment  Et de illis et non aliis judicari  MS sic de aliis et non alios judicari  is respectively to be given where their brethren are concerned  Finally they agreed that the magistrates within and without Burghs  In Burgh et Out Burgh Potestatem habebunt  MS in Burgh et in Suth Burgh  should have power to distrain the inhabitants of each kingdom in order to inforce the observation of the aforesaid customs between the kingdoms  happily those intestine miseries are swept  away from the face of the land and the strength of these walls is op∣posed only to the hostility of strangers When this place first arose to  importance is not known whether it was of any considerable strength during the conflicts between the Britons with their Roman allies and  the northern nations is not easy to determine Camden with other An∣tiquarians have not offered any thing but conjecture  Ex libello quodam incerti autoris quem mutuo sumpsi à Domino Monjoro erat de ori∣gine Scottorum  Berengus interfecto Rodrico Domino suo obtinuit locum habitandi in Brittannio a Mario et poltea edificavit villam de BerwicLel Col v p  Some authors alledge it was known to Ptolomy the Geographer who wrote in the time of Antoninus by the name of  Tuesis  but the situation described by him doth not correspond with that of the present town  According to Hector Boethius Berwick existed as a place of strength in the days of  Osbert  the Northumbrian King It is reasonable to con∣jecture when  Tweed  became the boundary between Scotland and Eng∣land that Berwick would arise as a barrier town be fortified and have an armed garrison In the account given of the Danish invasion under  Hubba  about the year Berwick is mentioned as the landing place of the invaders Whilst the Saxons possessed the country north of Tweed Berwick was not likely to have risen to any great impor∣tance being so near the royal seat of  Bamburgh  except it should have had a fortress as a safeguard to the episcopal seat of  Lindisfarn  The same author relates that  King Donald  having defeated the army of  Osbert  near the river Jedd marched down the Tweed to Berwick which the Saxons then had in possession and which they abandoned on the news of their Sovereign's overthrow Donald seized three Saxon vessels in the Bay with great riches on board upon which event he and his followers gave themselves up to riot and revelling of this the  Saxons took advantage and made an unexpected assault on the town in the night when many of the Scots were slain and their King was taken prisoner He also tells us that  King Gregory the Great  took Ber∣wick then possessed by the  Danes  and put the garrison to the sword after which the Scotch Monarch spent his winter there  Berwick  continued for many ages part of the dominions of Scotland and was one of the four original Scotch  burghs  Conjectures on the rise of Borroughs  From the manuscripts of the late Roger Gale  Esq  Opinions  concerning the aboriginal form of  human habitations  in general and  British  in particular founded upon the word BURROUGHS by  the Rev Mr Conyers Place  of Dorchester  Burrough and its contraction  Burgh  of which also I take  Burrow Barrow  and  Bury  to be so many corruptions is an allowed note of the antiquity of the place so called as well by  Cambden  himself as those who are the authors of the annotations upon him nor can there be a more effectual confirmation of that note than that those  old  and  mother towns  that have the privilege of sending members to parliament are particularly distinguished by that name and are called  Burroughs  or allowed to be so the whole title of many of them to their present enjoyment of that right in the state of decay they are now reduced to seems to rest in their claim to that title and in the respect and veneration which the evidences of antiquity inserted in that name bespeaks for them  I cannot perceive that the name  Burrough  or  Burgh  was instituted to denote any kind of eminence in the place so called beyond others so as to mean a  Fort  or  Castle  or place any way fortified with ramparts or otherwise distinguished by any peculiar advantages as is often suggested by  Camden  or that the name puts the place called by it under any distinction what∣ever unless accidentally besides that of common habitation the bare antiquity of which it only implys because it is often confounded with such appellatives to ascertain and distinguish it as  Burgh Castle Burgh Fort  c and that it signifies no more than  house houses or a town  a settlement where one or more families dwelt  Burrough  was the  habitation  and  Bour  was the  inhabitant  hence  neighbour  i e a  nighbour  or one that lived in a  Burrough  not far off  But the name  Burrough  though at first it directly meant only one common habitation yet carries in it monumental evidences of the original form of such habitation and indirectly lets us into that for our application of the name  Burrough  to the habitation of such animals whose natures are incapable of making improvements in their manner of dwelling that is still retained among us discovers the native and simple signification of the name  Burrough  when our ancestors gave their own dwellings that name for we appropriate it only to the under∣ground lodgings of animals as to the holes of  foxes badgers  and  rabbits  From whence I infer that when it was first applied to human habitation whether in an allusive sense from them or their's from it or whether both were simple and equally original that it signified the very same or what nearly resembled the habitations of those creatures and consequently that the inhabitants of this land when the name was given dwelt chiefly underground and lived not in houses raised from the ground but in holes dug in it which sense of the word seems still to obtain as to the dead though it has lost its native idea as to the living for hence we may call putting a corpse into a hole underground to  bury  or  burrough it  a  barrow  or  burrough  being a place dug for that purpose though the custom of monumental tumulation has abused the word to express the contrary to what it was instituted to express and to signify a  hill  instead of a  hole  Our original  Burroughs  in the primitive simplicity were but as so many human warrens con∣sisting of a set of underground caverns the lodging part and body at least of each dwelling run in and was underground and this is but suitable to the savage way of life of the old  Britons in other respects such as their going naked which alone cuts off all the ends almost of raising houses for to what end should men raise houses who had neither cloaths nor fur∣niture nor wanted any guard against the inclemency of the air nor had any intent of re∣tirement to answer but security from wild beasts or noise whilst they slept Their painted or rather smokebound hides looked as if they lived in rooms where smoke had no vent by win∣dows or chimneys to which we may add as an inducement to natural simplicity that under∣ground lodgings were both cooler in summer if our clime is ever too hot and warmer in win∣ter for which latter reason 'tis pretty near kept to in  Iceland Lapland  c  Purchas  says of the  Icelanders  all their houses are under ground Lib ca  Nor were the inhabitants of this island singular in this matter so no derogation to them be∣cause it seems to have been Nature's primitive mode of dwelling common with them to most nations The various notions of  of old that took their names from the custom of living in  holes  or  burroughs  strictly such is an instance of it hence it is that the  old Giants  are represented to us as underground livers all of them as  Polyphemus's Cave Cacus's Den  c The rustic Divinities of the heathen such as  Pan Faunus the Satyrs  c are proposed to us as residing in underground seats and your  Sibylls Trophonius  and the rest of them made choice of caverns to vent their oracles from as more awful and venerable by their resem∣blance of primitive and simple times when  heaven and earth  corresponded together more fami∣liarly and I am apt to think that the notion of your  and  Terrae Filii  men springing out of the earth did arise hence and that a great many suddenly bolting out at once from their  burroughs  like the  Tinners  in Cornwall from their mines might first give occasion to those fables and fancies of crops of armed troops starting up from dragons and serpents teeth to the great surprize of  Cadmus and Jason Ovid  reckons men's building houses and living above ground as an improvement or rather a degeneracy gradually introduced after the  golden age  and in process of time  Tum primum subiere domos domos antra fuere  Et densi frutices aut junctae ortice virgae  following to be sure the tracks of history and traditionary chronology at least from the crea∣tion in this matter  After the  deluge  the terror it had struck and the fear of its return made men keep chiefly to the mountains as the safest besides that the plains and flat countries must be all so mixed and thereby puddled that a century would scarce harden and settle them again sufficiently for safe and convenient habitation for till the waters had wrought themselves drains after such a thorough blend they must be drawn off very leisurely and when the fertility of the plains invited them down the distrust of the floods returning first put them upon building upwards from the level of which new project  Babel  seems to have been the first instance followed by others built after the same new mode by  Nimrod  in the plain of  Shinar  nor does it appear that any such thing had been practised before by the antediluvians and  Moses  's way of men∣tioning that piece of architecture does intimate the project to have been entirely new and that the tower or town of  Babel  was the first building that men had raised above ground for habita∣tion for  Cain  's building of a  city  may be accounted for by forming a society only or surround∣ing the place where he dwelt with trenches ramparts or fortifications such as his fears put him upon and does not determine it to any mode of building Digging downward for habita∣tion both before and long after the flood appears to have been the common and general prac∣tice and Nature's first genuine method which men departed from either through distrust or ignorance of God's providence lest there should be a second deluge or as the fear of wild  beasts or of each other grown wild or savage prevailed over Nature's present or more simple recourse for habitation or as the local inconveniences of the foundering in the natural mould might put them here and there upon artificial walls and roofs or as suffocating damps or sul∣phureous steams and exhalations made them continue building upwards as an expedient or as the nearness of the springs would not permit them to sink houses but forced them to above∣ground habitations this not being a thing of choice but necessity a violence offered to natural dictate and disposition men went no further nor faster into them than just in the simplest man∣ner to avoid inconvenience that put them upon it so as to live above ground with as much resemblance still as possible to living under ground either raising an artificial bank and then scooping out the earth from the side for even mud walls were not presently invented till some superior and happy genius discovered the tempering of the artificial paste and the use of it now so vulgar and universal which was once the secret and rarity of the age however now the prejudices from the reverse of custom and the modern refinements of artificial dwellings has turned the ideas and very thoughts of subterraneous living within walls and under roofs of earth of Nature's disposing into contempt and ridicule and we laugh at the simplicity and extream awkwardness of the thing yet we continue to pay regard to the name and while we spurn the substance load the shadow with dignity and preeminence and make it a title of preference to all that culture and elegance of modern architecture that has succeeded itAll the first settled habitations were  caves  nor is it likely there were houses unless stationary places of defence before or for some generations after the  flood  Had architecture been presently from the creation invented or been natural yet it is not likely there were any materials in the first ages to build withall for they would require considerable time for their generation there be∣ing few stones and still fewer quarries to be supposed perfectly formed the rocks requiring ages to bring them to a firmness beyond paste nor were the mines of metals hastily ripened to a hardness for tools nor are we sure that woods or timber trees were created mature or enew to be employed in building till they had by God's command propagated their several kinds  Brick  therefore or naked earth was of necessity probably not choice the first material of architecture and the only one which nevertheless must have been unserviceable had not the natural ex  station of  bitumen  upon the spot luckily supplied the want of cement to the first undertakers for from the creation to the building of the  tower of Babel  they had none at all of an artificial sort 'tis plain from the text so never had built  The best therefore that we can suppose of our top  British mansions and towns  when the name of  borroughs  was imposed on them in the barbarous state the inhabitants were then in is that they came up to the  uts  of the  Hottentots  or  Indian Savages  or other uncultivated tribes of men and if their houses stood above ground yet they were such  congesta culmina  espite  or extempore hovels as our beggars now but make against banks of the road side one degree removed from subterranean if at all they lived under earth if not under ground and indeed what are our houses still but supplemental caves above ground  Nor does the antique mode of living under ground seem to have gone off at once but by degrees by little and little since it is hardly yet quite worn out it is but lately that the fashion of ascending to houses has much prevailed most old houses may be observed to be descended into by steps and floors laid a good deal below the level with expence to have them so which is to be ascribed either to nature or to a remain of the old  British genius and custom  of under∣ground living still  icking in us  The old pavements of your  opus tesselatum  are generally found so low in the ground that I cannot see how they can be so well supposed to be either so far overgrown or sunk beneath the surface but rather to have been designedly at first laid under ground though by  Roman  hands in compliance with the natives' mode of underground habitations  Nor is it an unlikely conjecture that the vast and various cavities under ground such as those of the  Peak  and  Wookey  or  O  ey Hole  near  Wells  These are without doubt natural and ne∣ver could be habitable  and a great many others less famous may not be all the work of nature but in great mea∣sure the effects of underground architecture by men's cultivating the dispositions of nature and as they look like the  palaces  of some  old Giants  so they might be the  Windsors  and  Hampton Cour  of their times when underground dwell∣ings were in fashion and once admired no less for  magnificence  than now for prospects of  wild∣ness  and  horror  I know no hypothesis that can account so well for all those odd hollows sink∣ings in the ground and pits that are every where to be met withall and in some places too many and too regular to have happened there by chance  As just by Not∣tingham  and yet one cannot imagine that they should have been made there for any purposes above ground but as they are the manifest foundering in of subterranean caves by length of time why might they not be the work of men for habitation when  burrough life  was in fashion Abundance of these kinds of large basons I remember when I was a boy in  Ripon Common  in Yorkshire and a great many in a neighbouring  Heath  and  hard by here  c  Dorchester  After underground living was generally quitted as to natural and civil life yet we find how  devotion  and  superstition  still loved to keep it on by underground  cells chapels and ora∣tories  nor is it to the disadvantage of  burrough life  that so many of those of whom the world was not worthy are said to have dwelt in  dens and caves  of the earth some of choice and others for refuge  Grotius  notes on  Lot's  dwelling in a  cave  Genesis xix that  Strabo  re∣lates there were abundance of  caves  in that country which being one of those that were first inhabited strengthens the thought that they came not there by chance but were made by the men for habitation though by change of custom difused and the abundance of them in all countries that admit of it confirms the same truth as to their several aborigines  That there are fewer  burroughs  in our lower and flat countries and part of the nation tho' otherwise more populous and better stocked with modern towns than the hilly parts may also proceed from their being less commodious for the  burrough life  then in vogue which may be one reason why  Cornwall  has in it more  burroughs  in proportion than any other county and where the aboriginal inclination to  burrough life  very remarkably also exemplified itself among the inhabitants as many of which almost are said to live in  burroughs  in the old sense of the word as in those above ground  The  Romans  indeed represent the  Britons  when they found them as living in  huts of reeds or wood  and their  towns  as so many  woods  but the  Britons  who knew themselves best cannot be supposed without reason and propriety to have given a name to their habitations that speaks them to have been of another nature against which no foreign testimony can so far pre∣vail as to make us think otherwise but that in some period of time or other either then be∣fore or since the inhabitants notions of dwelling were agreeable to what that name expressed and that considerable dispositions were made actually among themselves accordingly  The name  burrough  appears to have travelled hither from  Germany  and the  North  whence we were first peopled and where a great many of their oldest and most considerable towns carry  burgh  and  burrough  in their name and the thing itself in the colder climates as I have hinted is pretty near kept up to The infamous custom of  incestuous community of wives  which  Caesar  takes notice of among the  Britons  and says they had ten or twelve of them wives together in common especially brothers with one another and parents with their children very well agrees with  burrough living  for families cohabiting in one common room together without partition and that suited such works of darkness must of course fall by that means into such  unnatural practice  He must mean  Ga∣v  ed  for by  Borrough English  the inheritance goes to the youngest child only  and that sort of odd tenure which they call  Burrough English  must as naturally as necessarily arise again from men's having community of wives for where men could not know which were their own which others children it of course drew them into the agreement of letting  all fare alike  The invention of this tenure of  Burrough English  has likewise raised a thought in my head con∣cerning the etymology of the name  England  itself that falls in with what I have said of  burroughs  from an old word still in use in the North which is  angle  and signifies a hole that runs under ground on the branch of a mine From the old word that worm takes its name whose use for baits has given the name of angling when we fish with it it is not unlikely but the name of  England  and  Angleland  might also come from living in subterraneous caverns a  burrough  differ∣ing from an  angle  as a part from the whole a  house  from a  town  or one  room  from a  house  If we suppose some of those  burroughs  like the  cave of Machpelah  double  Genesis ch xxiii but there is nothing said of its being dou∣ble there  that is running in several ways from one common mouth so that  Eng∣lishmen  was as much as to say  Burroughmen  or  cavernlivers  the very same as  which example makes it more likely and which I think is a much better conjecture than from  Angulus  or their living in a corner or from  angling  or from  Angelus  the story of the Pope's admiring the English boys which  paultry  etymologies yet are thought worthy of a place in our Antiquities That the name of  England  or  English∣man  By this argument the Britons could never be called  burroughlivers  as he before supposes since the name of  Eng∣land  was unknown till long after the arrival of the  Saxons  as it is thus of  cognate  signification may come from the word  angle  which is the same thing almost as  burrough  is still more likely from hence that the  Angles  or  Anglelivers  have their original fixed in that same quarter whence as has been observed  burrough  came and so the two words give mutually light to one another and strength to what I have observed the native force of the one supports the denominative title of the other and with an equal propriety had arbitrary custom hap∣pened to have made the counterchange of application the  kingdom  might have been called  Burroughland  and our  towns  for  burroughs angles  Edgar  King of Scotland gave it to the  See of Durham  according to Hollingshead in honour of  St Cuthbert  under whose banner he had obtained  an important victory This donation was made about the year Ralph Flambert after a vacancy in the See for three years  from the death of William de Caralepho was consecrated Bishop in he disregarding the great gift of Edgar to the church made an  irruption into his territories on which  Edgar  provoked at his ingra∣titude reassumed the town of  Berwick  with its valuable appendages  In the reign of King Henry II William King of Scotland surrendered  Berwick  to the Crown of England as a pledge for the payment of his ransom and it is said that King Henry built a  castle  there  Collier's Dictionary  after Wil∣liam's failure in his stipulated payment But in the time of King Richard I the ransom money being paid which was no less than l Berwick was restored to the Scotch  King John in resentment of the homage paid by the Barons of Nor∣thumberland to Alexander King of Scotland laid waste the whole county and took  Berwick  by storm  A D Castrum de Berwic captum a Joanne RegeLel Col v p  King John is charged with committing the most savage barbarities on this occasion having as it is said in the Chronicle of Mailross Jews with him

on them various other bodily pains His troops burnt the town of  Berwick  the King disgracing royalty by setting fire with his own hands to the house in which he had lodged he also permitted the adjoining monastery of  Coldingham  to be plun∣dered  Alexander King of Scotland still remaining under sentence of ex∣communication for his adherence to  Louis  who had been invited to accept the Crown of England by King John's dissident Barons after peace was made with King Henry III and on Alexander's acceding thereto the Pope's Legate gave authority to the  Archbishop of York  and  Bishop of Durham  to give him absolution for which purpose they met the King at  Berwick  This event happened in the year  In the year  Gilbert Earl of Pembroke  Earl Marshal of England on his marriage with Marjory sister of Alexander II King of Scotland came to  Berwick  to receive his bride and celebrate his nuptials  In the year  Edmond  the younger son of King Henry III after being invested with the dukedom of Lancaster and the forfeited ho∣nours and estates of the Earl of Leicester paid a visit to the King and Queen of Scotland at  Berwick  where the King with a numerous assem∣bly of his Nobles celebrated the royal birthday  The great assembly of the states of England and Scotland was held here on the d day of August for determining the claims of the several competitors for the Crown of

Dominicans adjacent to the castle An adjourn∣ment was made to the same place in the month of June in the follow∣ing year where the King again appeared in person and difficulties still remaining unsolved a further adjournment was made to the ensuing October at which time his Majesty attended as before again came to  Berwick  Several intermediate days being given for solving the inci∣dent  questions which arose on the claims the th day of November A D was appointed for giving judgment in the hall of the castle when  John Baliol  was pronounced successor to the Crown The seal used by those who had governed Scotland during the interregnum was broken in four parts and delivered up to King Edward to be de∣posited in his treasury as a monument and evidence of the sovereignty and direct dominion of that Monarch over Scotland  In Leland's Collectanea it is noted that in the year  John King of Scottes contrary to his feith and aliegeaunce rebellid agayne King Edward and cam into England and brent and slew Wher∣apon King Edward with a great host went to Newcastelle apon Tyne and passid the water of Twede and besiegid Berwick and gat it and also he gat the castelle of Dunbar and ther were slayne XXV M and VII C Scottes And so proceeded forth and gat the castelle of Rokesburgh and the castelles of Shremborough Stryvelin and Ged∣worth and his people foured all the lande  Lel Col v p  After these several operations the King returned to Berwick where he resided some time to direct several new works for the better fortification of the place among which was a ditch over the neck of land from Tweed to the sea in breadth feet and feet in depth  A D Edwardus Rex occupat villam de Berwic Richardus de Cornubia frater Edmundi comitis Cornub occisus spiculo in villa de

Berwik with ditches and waullesIbid p  The accounts given of these successes of King Edward are various and authors differ much in regard to the slaughter which attended them The King being encamped near the  nunnery  offered terms of peace which after being demurred upon for two days were rejected by the garrison On the next day being Thursday after Easter A D the English army was drawn up on an extensive plain near the nunnery at the eastern foot of  Hallydown Hill  in full view of  Berwick Castle  and the high parts of the town There the King conferred the honour of Knighthood on  Henry Percy  and others as was usual in those  times on the like occasions The navy perceiving the display of ban∣ners from the mouth of the Tweed where the fleet then lay and pre∣suming the attack was beginning anxious to win part of the laurels of the day pushed over the bar and gained the haven by which three ships were lost having stranded where they were burnt by the towns∣men the rest were scarce able to escape in the ebb tide King Edward desirous to save his fleet ordered an immediate attack whilst the chief part of the garrison was employed in defending the town nearest the haven He is charged by Fordun and other Scottish writers with using a delusive artifice in detaching a body of men under the cover of some rising grounds to gain an approach on another quarter and by dis∣playing Scotch colours induce the garrison to permit their advanc∣ing near the fortifications under a presumption that they were a rein∣forcement for the town The English authors take no notice of this stratagem It appears from the best authorities that the fortifications of this place at that time consisted chiefly of a ditch and a rampier of earth with a barricado of timber through these the English army made their entrance with very little difficulty and the garrison and in∣habitants astonished at the suddenness of the event and overwhelmed by superior force were slaughtered without much resistance The chief opposition that was made was by Flandrian Merchants who held out a strong tower called the  Red Hall  till the evening when fire be∣ing set to it the building was consumed and all within perished In the reduction of this tower the brother of the  Earl of Cornwall  a va∣liant Knight was slain by a spear's piercing his eye as he looked up to those who fought above All the gentlemen and fighting men of Fife are said to have been put to the sword The  castle  commanded by  William Douglas  surrendered the same day and its garrison consisting of men were permitted to march out armed on swearing from thenceforth not to fight against the King or kingdom of England but their Governor was detained a prisoner Fordun says the number of slain was that the streets ran with blood two days and in such quantities as to make mills go Boetheus says also the slain were about in number and says that mills were actually set agoing with the blood Matthew Westminster says that all were slain without distinc∣tion of sex or age in number In the instructions from the Regency and Council of Scotland to their Procurators at Rome A D it is said that after taking  Berwick  the King and his army com∣mitted the most barbarous cruelties on the inhabitants who to the num∣ber of almost were slain without distinction of character sex or  age The churches afforded no protection to those who fled thither after being defiled with the blood of the slain and spoiled of all their ornaments the King and his followers made stables of them for the horses of the army  In these instructions there is the following charge against King EdwardThat he had violently seized Baliol's person and kingdom and compelled his Chancellor to resign his great seal and after Baliol and his son were sent prisoners to London he caused letters of resigna∣tion to be forged and afterwards published them to the inhabitants of Scotland although they never were nor should be ratified by Baliol  This carnage may be ascribed to a resentment of the cruelties committed the preceding year by the men of  Berwick  and the fighting men of  Fife  in attacking certain English vessels that had entered the port setting fire to the ships and putting the several crews to death  On the th day of August A D the King received the ho∣mage  The oath of fealty then administered  Because we are under the subjection of the thrice noble Prince and our dear Lord Sire Edward King of England Lord of Ireland and Duke of Aquitain we do faithfully pro∣mise for ourselves and for our heirs upon pain of body and estate that we will serve him truly and loyally against all manner of people that may live and die whenever it shall be required or commanded by our said Lord the King of England or his heirs that we will hinder him from damage as much as we can and set upon his enemies with all our forces where ever they may be found And to the end that we may firmly keep and hold these presents we do bind ourselves our heirs and our goods and we have sworn to this upon the blessed Evangelists Besides all we that are present and every of us separately have done homage to our Lord the King of England in these words  I will be true and loyal and bear true faith and allegiance to Edward King of England and his heirs and serve him with life and limb and do him all earthly honour against all manner of people that may live and die and from henceforth I will not bear arms nor be aiding in council against him or against his heirs on any cause whatsoever So help me God and all the Saints In witness of these things we have made these letters patent and sealed them with our seals Given at Berwick upon Tweed the th day of August in the year of the reign of our said Lord the King of England  of the Scotch Nobility here in the presence of an English Par∣liament summoned for that purpose In the year succeeding he estab∣lished an Exchequer here on the principles of that at Westminster for the receipt of the Scotch revenue  In the year the English inhabitants being struck with a panic on the approach of  Sir William Wallace  with his forces evacuated the place  His stature and strength were gigantic his aspect and address pleasing and attractive of popularity he was subtle in devising and dexterous in the execution of the most adventurous and perilous projects In an old Poem he is thus described  Wallace stature of greatness and of height  Was judged thus by discretion of sight  That saw him both on Cheval and in Weed  F I ¼  Nine quarters  large of height he was indeed  Third part that length in shoulders brode was he  Right seemly strong and lusty for to see  In limmes great with stalwart pace and sound  His brands hard with armes long and round  His hands made right like to a palmeir  Of manlike make with nails long and cleir  Proportioned fair and long was his visage  Right sad of speech and able of courage  Both breasted high with sturdy craig and greet  His lippes round his nose square and neit  Burning brown hair on brows and brees light  Cleir asper eyes like diamonds full bright  Under his chin on his left side was seene  By hurt a wan his colour was sangueene  Wounds he had in mony divers place  But fair and whole well keeped was his face  Of riches als he keept no proper thing  Gave that he wan like Alexander the King  In time of peace meek as a mind should bee  When war approached the right Hector was hee  To Scotsmen right and good credence he gave  But known enemies they could him nought deceive  and fled with their moveables to the southern parts of Northum∣berland  Cressingham  Cressingham was a Clergyman Rector of Ruddeby Chief Justiciary in York Assize and Prebendary of many ChurchesHe never assumed spiritual Ensigns or Armour or was habited in the Clerical Garb but always used the Helmet and Breastplate in which be died  whom King Edward had made his Treasurer from his avarice neglected putting the King's commands in execution for building a stone wall along the side of the new foss and applied the King's treasures to his own appropriations so that  Berwick  was appa∣rently in so defenceless a state as not to be esteemed tenable by the garrison against Wallace's troops  Cressingham  was slain at the battle of Sterling Bridge and was flead by the soldiers who divided his skin among them as a trophy  The castle of Berwick  was so strong and well maintained that the Scots were not able to reduce it the Regency levied a great force the army consisting of armed horse light horse and foot on the approach of this formidable armament the Scots deserted the town and the faithful garrison in the castle who had sustained a long blockade were happily relieved  One of the Towers in Berwick Castle called Hogs Tower was at this time the prison of Sir William Douglas where it is said he died  The alarm occasioned by Wallace's insurrection and the invasion with which England was then threatened brought forth excellent fruits which still bless this kingdom and are the felicity of the present age  the ratification of the great charter and charter of the forests  with a most inestimable addition  a grant and concession that no tallage or aid should thenceforth be imposed on the people without the assent of the Prelates No∣bles Knights Burgesses and other Freemen  King Edward in the year mustered that victorious army here with which he penetrated the remotest parts of Scotland and compleated its conquest  In the year  Wallace  having been betrayed into the hands of his enemies suffered an ignominious execution and half of his body was ordered to be exposed on Berwick Bridge In the succeeding year  Neal Bruce  brother of Robert Bruce was taken in the castle of Kil∣drummy with many other persons of great distinction who were sent prisoners to Berwick where King Edward ordered them to be tried by Justices sent thither by whom they were condemned and sentenced to be hanged drawn and quartered  The Countess of Buchan  sister to the  Earl of Fife  eloped from  John Comyn  her husband and carried in her retinue all his warhorses with which she repaired to  Robert Bruce  at  Scone  and in the absence of the Earl her brother who was then with the King of England and whose hereditary office it was to place the crown on the heads of the Scotch Monarchs she assumed that high duty and put the diadem on the head of  Bruce  King Edward sen∣teaced her to be shut up in a wooden cage in one of the towers of Ber∣wick Castle  Redpat  's Border hist p  From the order set forth by Rymer it appears that the Chamberlain of Scotland or his Lieutenant at Berwick was to cause this cage to be made of sufficient strength in which she was to be at∣tended and served by one or two English women of the town of Berwick and no Scotch man or woman or any other person except the servant or servants appointed her were to be suffered to have access to her Ano∣ther author  Westminster  says that the King declared as she did not strike with the sword she should not die by it but ordered her to be shut up in an ha∣bitation of wood and iron shaped like a crown and to be hung out at Berwick in the open air for a spectacle and everlasting reproach both  living and dead to all that passed  Mary  a sister of  Bruce  was ordered to be shut up in like manner at the castle of  Roxburgh  The Countess of Buchan lived in this confinement six years when by the royal mandate she was released from her cage and given in charge to  Henry de Beaumont  In the year the stores ordered by the King of England to be delivered by the citizens of London at  Berwick  for the use of the forces against the Scots were barrels of honey barrels of wine lb weight of iron lb of hempcord for balistae lb of hemp balistae of one foot of two feet balistae de turno arrows for balistae of one foot arrows for those of two feet feathered arrows of copper for balistae de turno  Rymer III  The mea∣sure by which these balistae are here distinguished relates to the arrows these engines were to throw as the accepted phrase in regard to can∣non is so many pounders as the weight of the shot may be they are bored for  In the year King Edward II his Queen and Nobles spent their winter at Berwick the King returning thither from his Scotch expedition The dearth was so great in Scotland this year that the people fed on horseflesh and other carrion  Ibid  During the King's resi∣dence here he confirmed the election of Richard de Kellow to the See of Durham on the death of Anthony de Beck  In  Robert Bruce  attempted to surprize  Berwick  by a scalade in the night but after ladders of ropes were fixed the place was saved by the barking of a dog which alarmed the garrison and the assailants were repulsed with considerable loss  In the year King Edward II rendezvoused his army at  Ber∣wick  consisting of horse three thousand of which were com∣pleatly armed horses and men and foot they were in part lodged within the town and the rest in tents without the walls The carriages attending this army were numerous as no supplies could be drawn from a country desolated by war and wasted by famine Malms∣bury says if they had passed in one line they would have extended sixty leagues in length Most authors agree that so fine an army had  not in the memory of man marched from England The army of the Scots consisted of advantageously posted and waiting the ap∣proach of the English on the banks of  Bannocks Burn  I seem to be led involuntarily to a relation of this battle famous for the establish∣ment of  Robert Bruce  on the throne of Scotland in its event  Sterling Castle  had sustained a long siege and blockade and the Go∣vernor was at length obliged to accede to certain articles under which if this fortress was not relieved before an appointed day it was to be surrendered to  Bruce  King Edward determined to march to its relief and with all possible expedition moved his army from Berwick  Robert Bruce  informed of the intention of the English Monarch resolved to abide the event of a battle rather than raise the siege He had viewed the ground and fixed upon a part near the castle where he should have only just sufficient room to marshal his troops with advantage accord∣ing to their arms This place was defended on the one hand by in∣accessible rocks and on the other by a morass having the water of Bannokburn in front King Edward being informed the country near Sterling was full of morasses and difficult to be passed so that his horse could not be of the service he wished he levied a reinforcement of foot from Yorkshire from Northumberland from Durham and from Derby and Nottingham In the advance the army was divided into ten columns men in each commanded by leaders of the most distinguished character the  Earls of Gloucester and Hereford  led the van the center was led by the  King  in person  Sir Giles D'Argentein  and  Aymer de Valence Earl of Pembroke  Generals un∣der him The army under these divisions is said to have covered a large tract of country and was a sight august and solemn the whole scene made resplendent by burnished arms and displayed ensigns  As the English approached  Bruce  led his troops to occupy the chosen ground on the Saturday before the battle To strengthen the station he caused pits to be dug in front armed with pointed stakes within covered with hurdles or flakes and concealed by turfs and rushes On the morning of Sunday being Midsummer Eve  Bruce  with his Lords and Chieftains attended solemn devotions and mass in the front of the army and the Priests went through the ranks exhorting each soldier  to exert his powers for the relief of his country and rather die a martyr in the virtuous cause than see the English again become ty∣rannical taskmasters as they had been in the time of King Edward I  of detested memory  Such arguments and exhortations served to inflame the Scotch army with enthusiastic ardour The English were ordered to advance so near  Bruce  's station on Sunday evening that though harrassed with a tedious march they were obliged to lay under arms all night for fear of a surprize This evening was not without several skirmishes and reencounters in which the English were worsted in one of these  Robert Bruce  engaged and slew  Sir Henry Boynton  cleav∣ing his head with a battle ax A party of horse under the com∣mand of  Lord Robert Clifford  and  Henry Beaumont  attempting to gain the castle were engaged by a chosen band of Spearmen led by  Earl Murray  and put to the rout  Sir William Dayncourt  was slain and  Thomas Gray  made prisoner  Lel Coll  the  Earl of Gloucester  was unhorsed but rescued  Malmsbury  The disposition of the Scotch army on the day of battle was in four divisions  Sir Thomas Randolph  commanded the van  Edward Bruce  the right wing and  Sir James Douglas  the left  Robert Bruce  was with the body of reserve or rear The Scotch were all on foot that by ma∣king the danger and distress of the engagement equal the ardour of each might by example be exhilerated The soldiers of the body of re∣serve were covered with light coats of mail which a sword could not penetrate they carried an ax in the belt and lances in their hands Malmsbury describes the Scotch army moving "as thick as a hedge" The leaders were men of that skill and valour that they possessed the confidence of the troops In the English army the foot consisting of spearmen and archers were in the van the horse were on each flank and in these positions the armies engaged  The onset was vigorous and well maintained on both sides The  Earl of Gloucester  commanded that part of the line which was attacked by  Sir James Douglas's  corps consisting of Borderers and Irish Scots or Katerans vulgarly called Redshanks a fierce and valiant race The English unable to sustain the shock began to give way when the Earl impatient of disgrace and inflamed with ire accompanied by a chosen band rushed into the thickest of the foes where he was beaten from his horse and slain The covered pits deterred or frustrated his Knights from effecting his rescue Malmsbury says with great warmth  confundat eos Dominos they were in number and in the emer∣gency might have effected his relief  Sir Giles D'Argentein  a man much esteemed by  Robert Bruce  and of great military fame one of the Commanders of the  Gens d' Armes  who guarded the King advanced to  Gloucester's  relief but died in the attempt  Robert de Clifford Payen de Tiptoft William Marescal Edmund Mayley  and several other eminent leaders were equally unfortunate in those parts of the army where they commanded and were soon numbered with the slain The English archers who had so often carried victory with them in former conflicts were attacked in flank and put to the rout by a troop of light cavalry close armed who were remounted for this critical service and led by  Sir Robert Keith  Marshal of Scotland The confusion among the archers and the fall of such eminent leaders struck the English army with a panic which was not a little increased by the sight of a large body of men advancing over the summit of a distant eminence who were no other than the attendants on the carriages and baggage drawn up in martial array and displaying pieces of linen on the ends of spears which at that distance appeared like a crowd of banners Confusion and uproar soon took place and the English Monarch was advised to secure his retreat as Victory was declaring on every hand for  Bruce  and the English forces wearied and fainting were giving way The King with great reluctance and shame consented to move the royal standard the sight of which compleated what the valour of the Scotch phalanx had so gloriously begun the rout became general and mul∣titudes fell as well under the sword in the pursuit as in the waters of  Bannockburn  and  Forth  The effusion of blood was greatly spared by the avarice of plunder the rich baggage of the English army affording immense booty to the victors Of the Scots only two leaders of note fell  William Vipont  and  Walter Ross  Seven hundred English Gentle∣men were missing after the battle the greatest part of whom were among the prisoners  Sterling  surrendered to the King of Scotland who ordered the fortifications to be destroyed to their foundations Redpath in his Border History says  The rout of the English was indeed very entire but neither the number they brought to the field nor the loss they sustained appear to have been nigh so great as the Scottish writers represent them  King Robert Bruce  treated the prisoners with great humanity and buried the dead with all due decorum The bodies of the  Earl of Glou∣cester  and  Lord Robert Clifford  he sent to the King at  Berwick  to be in∣terred  with the honours due to their rank and military fame On ac∣count of a personal friendship which had formerly subsisted between them he liberated without ransom his prisoner  Lord Ralph de Moun∣thermer  husband to the Countess of Gloucester the King of England's sister  King Edward with a body of horse fled towards  Berwick  pursued by  Sir James Douglas  with a party of light cavalry who effected no∣thing but taking up a few stragglers who fell off from the King's troop He first took shelter in the castle of  Dunbar  from whence he was con∣veyed by sea to  Bambrough  or  Berwick  It is certain he was at  Berwick  the third day after this defeat as he issued a proclamation from thence to advise his subjects of the loss of his  privy seal  which was restored to him by  Mounthermer  on his return  After this victory various bands of Scots ravaged Northumberland  In the year the Scots attempted to take  Berwick  by surprize by means of their shipping with which they entered the river under false colours but being discovered by the garrison before they began an attack suffered considerable loss e'er they could effect an escape  In the following year the dearth was so great in Northumberland that the people were obliged to eat the flesh of horses and dogs A quarter of wheat sold for shillings  Berwick  had continued in the possession of the English for years when the Commander in the town being corrupted betrayed it to the  Earl of Murray  in the year who led a body of  Robert Bruce  's forces  James Duglas by the helpe of Patrike Counte of March and Peter Spalding of Berwike got Berwike owt of the Englischmennes handes But the castel kept a XI wekes after and then for lak of vitaile and rescue was gyven up Then Roger Horseley the Captain of the castel for the Englischmen lost one of his yes  Lel Col v p  Barber the Historian of Bruce says that one  Spalding  incensed against the Governor's cruelty towards the Scotch inhabitants had de∣termined to betray the town into the hands of Bruce's party and ac∣cordingly  having intimated his design and assigned the time and place for the enterprize when it was his turn to mount guard at the  Cow∣gate Randolph  and  Douglas  with a chosen band repaired to  Dunse Park  and under cover of the night advanced to a part of the wall which was left unguarded and by ladders entered the town unper∣ceived by any but  Spalding  They lay concealed till daylight when other forces coming up upon the assault were aided by those within and gained the place by noon Many of the garrison and townsmen retired into the castle from whence they made a sally presuming the Scotch forces were weak from the thin display of banners but they were repulsed with some loss The news of regaining  Berwick  was soon spread over the adjacent country and numbers of Scotch crowded thither to maintain the place and assist in the siege of the castle which stood out six days  This differs widely from Leland's account  and then capitulated on terms for the garrison to march out with their arms and depart for England The Scotch King  Robert Bruce  soon after arrived and with his Court resided some time in the castle He made his soninlaw  Walter Steward of Scotland  Governor who ambitious of possessing a settlement on the borders where he might display his youthful courage called out Gentlemen his dependents with others of inferior rank skilful in shooting with bows and working engines for the more effectual defence of the place  Sir John Crab  a Fleming of high reputation in his art was made chief Engineer  King Edward in the succeeding year prepared to recover  Berwick  and on the first of September approached with a large body of troops having with him  Lancaster Pembroke Arundell Hertford Warren  and the  Earl Marshal  the King's brother  Hugh D'Espencer Roger de Tam∣mori  and  Hugh Deudeley  parceners to the earldom of Gloucester by marriage of the coheiresses the late Earl's sisters This force was ac∣companied by a fleet from the cinque ports laden with provisions and all kind of stores The English fortified their camp and then pro∣ceeded to an assault The walls of the town are described to be so low that an assailant might strike the people that defended them with a spear On the seventh of September they attempted an escalade at dif∣ferent parts in the same time and a ship was directed to approach with an engine to attempt the walls on the side next the haven but all  these were fruitless the ship was left on ground by ebb of tide and burnt by the garrison In the next general assault which was made on the th of September the English employed a great machine called a  Sow  constructed for holding and defending men who were moved in it towards the foot of the wall in order to undermine and sap its foundation Devices were used to burn this machine but by throwing a stone of vast weight from an engine the Sow was split and her oc∣cupiers dislodged On an attack of  Marygate  the draw bridge was burnt and the gate in great danger but forces from the castle coming to its defence the assailants were obliged to retire These efforts har∣rassed and weakened the garrison considerably and the town must on another assault have fallen into the hands of the English if Lancaster had not withdrawn his forces from the camp exercising his malignant spirit at this critical time against the King whom he hated most inve∣terately The  Earl of Murray  and  Lord Douglas  had entered England with chosen men and penetrated almost to the city of  York  the Queen escaping with difficulty These circumstances determined Edward to raise the siege of  Berwick  King Robert Bruce  perceiving the importance of this place strength∣ened the walls and raised them considerably in height giving also many new towers and additional bulwarks to the whole  In the year  King Robert Bruce  at this place ratified the treaty of peace entered into with King Edward III by his plenipotentiaries at  Bishop Thorpe  near  York  In  Joan  the sister of King Edward III being contracted to  David  the son and heir of  King Robert Bruce  was conveyed to  Berwick  with a splendid retinue where she was received by the  Earl of Murray  and  Lord Douglas  representatives of the King he being sick and the nuptials were celebrated with great magnificence She was called  Make Peace  and carried with her the ragman roll and all records which had been seized by King Edward I to be again deposited in the Scotch archives  At this ceremony a magnificent parade was made by the nobles of each nation and a sumptuous pageant crowded the place with all that solemn pomp which in the days of chivalry decked out public specta∣cles Sumptured horses and men braced in shining arms forming long  trains of steel effigies stiffened in coats of mail and strapped like inani∣mate beings to the saddle were the chief objects  Lord Mortimers'  retinue alone consisted of nine score Knights properly caparisoned with their Esquires Gentlemen and Yeomen  The expedition of  Lord Henry Beaumont  and his associates into Scot∣land in the year being attended with remarkable success be∣came an object of serious attention with the English Monarch in so much that  Edward Baliol  supported by this party in his pretensions to the Crown of Scotland as successor of his father  John Baliol  having gained the castle of  Roxburgh  King Edward received his letters patent issued from thence in which he acknowledged the King of England supreme Lord of Scotland and ceded to him the  town castle and coun∣ty of Berwick  to be annexed to his kingdom with many other advan∣tageous cessions and terms of amity and alliance of such weight and consideration that the King summoned his parliament to meet at  York  to deliberate thereon As many of the states especially the Prelates were absent nothing was determined in general it was thought expe∣dient to treat with the guardian and nobles of  King David  's party for which purpose commissioners were instructed to require homage and fealty from the Scotch King and a cession of  Berwick  but these requi∣sitions were rejected with the utmost disdain  Baliol  during this time had a perilous escape from  Annan  and was obliged to take refuge in England his party being thrown into the utmost confusion King Edward was too far advanced in the cause to recede and therefore ac∣cepted the terms proposed by  Baliol  at  Roxburgh  and ratified them on his part  Edward Baliol gave up Berwick Roxburg Dedinburg Pebilles and Dunfres to King Edward and promisid to make hym homage for the resideu after that the hole Englisch Hoste had faught with the Scottes and had so great a victory of the toune of Berwick was gyven up to King Edward  Lel Col v p  The English did not recover  Berwick  till the th year of the reign of King Edward III after the battle of  Halydoun Hill  where the slaugh∣ter of the Scottish forces was terrible Earls Knights Esquires and common men died in the field a carnage dread∣ful to recount and from the very idea of which the soul recoils with horror  King Edward the Third  on being refused the homage of  David Bruce  and restitution of  Berwick  ordered his Herald to proclaim his defiance of the Scotch King The English army began to besiege  Berwick  on the th of April The Scots knowing the reduction of this place would be one of the first and chief enterprizes of their adversa∣ries to the utmost of their power put it in a state of defence to resist the great shock they presumed it would necessarily sustain they filled it with a garrison of chosen veterans and made  Sir William Keith  gover∣nor of the  town  and  Patrick Earl of Dunbar  the keeper of the chief fortress or citadel The King soon arrived and remained in person before the walls about a month when perceiving from the strength of the garrison and the vigorous defence they made that it would not be easy to reduce the place he marched part of his army into Scot∣land carrying the horrid ravages of war as far as  Scone Dundee  and  Dumbarton  The most savage cruelties mark those times the wild American never devised more shocking barbarities than stained these borders each nation was ingenious in torture in modes of devastation and in the prosecution of revenge Having glutted their avarice of blood and being loaded with pillage they again returned to  Berwick  which King Edward still found unsubdued After receiving reinforce∣ments he declared his determination was either to be master of  Ber∣wick  or effect something of consequence by bringing his adversaries to battle The siege was changed into a strict blockade the besieged distressed by the cutting off supplies made many sallies with various fortune they made a vigorous attack upon the fleet and most of the navy then before  Berwick  was burnt The garrison still entertained hopes of relief and refused to capitulate presuming this key to the kingdom was of too great consequence to the Scotch at that time to be neglected and suffered to fall into the hands of the enemy  Lord Douglas  had levied a powerful army with which he marched to the neighbourhood of  Berwick  but to the great distress of the garrison who believed their day of deliverance was at hand instead of attacking the English  Douglas  crossed the Tweed and in sight of the town marched along the coast towards  the castle of Bambrough  which being esteemed impregnable was chosen by the King of England as a secure residence for his Queen The Scotch wasted several days in blocking up that fortress and ravaging the adjacent parts hoping that King Edward's sollicitude for his Queen would induce him to raise the siege of  Berwick  The device which had been practised with effect in the year did not now take place King Edward was not to be moved from his determined purpose the garrison reduced to extremities for want of provisions and dispirited by the apparent neglect of  Douglas  proposed a treaty which King Edward readily attended to and the capitulation was concluded on the th day of July under the following condi∣tions That the  town  and  castle  should be surrendered to King Edward on the th if not relieved with men at arms or by a battle that in the interval there should be a cessation of arms that in case of a surrender the lives and properties of the garrison and inhabitants should be protected with liberty to such as were so inclined to leave the place and that the Governor should have safe conduct granted him to the Scotch army to communicate the articles  Sir William Keith  re∣paired to the Scotch camp without delay and there prevailed that an attempt should be made to relieve the place a measure totally disap∣proved by some of the oldest and most experienced of the Scotch leaders  In this interval a transaction is said to have taken place which sullies the lustre of Edward's military character and stamps an odium on his memory it stands recorded to the following effect by Bucha∣nan Boece and other Scotch authors of great credit  Hostages were given by the Scots for performance of their part of the treaty one of whom was the eldest son of  Sir Alexander Seeton  who was Deputy Governor and took command on  Keith's  resorting to the camp King Edward had also in his camp  Seeton  's younger son taken a prisoner at the assault made on the navy The King apprehending that by the approach of the Scotch army he might probably be de∣prived of the capture of Berwick an object of so great importance soon after the departure of  Keith  contrary to the faith of Princes the sacredness of treaties the common policy of nations and all private honour demanded an immediate surrender of the place threatening if  Seeton  refused that he would immediately hang up his two sons the hostage and the prisoner before the walls  Seeton  remonstrated but Edward regardless of all the charges made against him for the violation of public faith caused a gibbet to be erected in full view of the town to put in execution his infamous threat  Seeton  struggling between honour and parental feelings between duty to his country and love  for his children suffered all the pangs arising from a conflict in which every sentiment was on the rack Nature would have prevailed and  Seeton  's children been saved by a sacrifice of his country's honour and his own had not the mother with all the virtue and heroism of a Roman matron and the greatness of the most exalted mind argued forcibly to support his principle and sustain his fainting soul and when yet he seemed to relax she withdrew him from the horrid spec∣tacle that he might retain his rectitude though his sons were the in∣estimable price by which it was maintained Edward unrelenting put them to death and  Seeton  kept the town  This transaction is denied by the English Historians who affirm that the Scotch army came in fight before the truce was expired and there∣fore Edward could have no pretence for demanding a surrender  Smollet vol p  Tyrell says on expiration of the truce mentioned by Boece and Buchanan King Edward summoned the town to surrender to which Seeton replied he could not consent thereto as he had assurances of speedy relief The King insisted on the terms of the truce by which the surrender was stipulated and the time was now expired Seeton still refused would have pre∣varicated and argued which so incensed the King that by advice of his Council he executed one of Seeton's sons This act is said to have induced the townsmen whose sons were hostages to solicit new terms and additional days for cessation of arms which King Edward granted  It does not appear that Seeton's son was an hostage his name is not in any record of that treaty but presuming there was a former treaty which was renewed or prolonged and of which no record is now in being this difficulty ceases Fordun expresly says King Edward caused Seeton's son Thomas to be executed on a gibbet in sight of his parents but agrees with Tyrell that it was not done till after the time of the treaty was expired  This argument is futile and seems weak in opposition to the uniformity of the Scotch Historians  On the th of July  Lord Douglas  led his army over the Tweed and encamped at a place called  Bothull  or  Bothville  the English possessed  Halydown Hill  a very considerable eminence on the west of Berwick having an easy declivity towards the river the other sides were steeper The Scotch disregarding this apparent advantage determined to engage on the Scotch side of the hill not only to secure a retreat but in case of victory to take advantage of the flow of tide which would render the Tweed impassable to the English if they should be routed  The Scotch army was disposed in four grand divisions  John Murray  commanded the first with  Lord Andrew Frazer  and his sons  Simon  and  James  the second was commanded by  Robert Lord High Steward of  Scotland  with the principal men of his kindred and the  Earl of Monteith  the third by the  Earls of Ross Sutherland and Strathern  and the fourth by  Lord Archibald Douglas  Guardian of the kingdom of Scotland and Commander in Chief accompanied by the Earls of  Lenox  and  Carrick  The whole army amounted to The number of King Edward's army is not positively mentioned by any author It is supposed the number of the Scotch was not so great as Historians have asserted and that they were nearly equal to their adversaries King Edward also disposed his army in four divisions each of which was flanked by choice and skilful archers  When both sides were ready to engage the onset was a while sus∣pended by the appearance of a Scotchman of gigantic stature who had gained the name of  Turnbull  on account of a gallant exploit by which King Robert Bruce was saved from the attacks of a wild bull which had unhorsed him as he was hunting  Turnbull  attended by a great mastiff  Some of the Borderers on the western Marches kept mastiffs or bulldogs which were let loose on the ravaging parties Nicholson and Burn's Hist West  approached the English army and gave a challenge for single combat After a short pause which the singularity of the cir∣cumstance occasioned the challenge was accepted by  Sir Robert Benhale  a young Norfolk Knight much inferior in stature to the Scotch cham∣pion but of great strength and adroitness in military atchievements The mastiff immediately flew forward and was received by the Knight with a stroke upon the loins with his sword which severed his body The Scotch champion advanced  Benhale  with great agility and skill eluded the heavy blows aimed at him and first cut off the left arm of his adversary and at last struck off his head  Stowe  The Scotch army began to ascend the hill about the hour of vespers with great impetuosity their leaders chieftains and men at arms dis∣mounted the more to animate the troops by rendering the danger equal They were soon out of breath in consequence of ascending the steep The English archers were advantageously placed in different stations on the hill so as to pour down such showers of arrows on the close bodies of the Scotch troops as made a terrible slaughter they were also greatly annoyed by the rolling down of large stones from the emi∣nence and were soon thrown into confusion  Smollet v p  The English comman∣ders  instantly availing themselves of the enemy's disorder ordered an attack to be made by the spearmen and men at arms by which they were pressed whilst breathless and dispirited so that multitudes fell The Scotch often retreated and again rallied and bravely returned to the fight fiercely maintaining the battle till their General was pierced by a spear his fall struck the army with a panic and a total rout ensued The carnage was dreadful The servants charged with the care of the horses fled and left their masters to the destroying sword of a victorious enemy who were not accustomed to mercy Edward at the head of a chosen brigade of cavalry and archers on horseback at∣tended by  Lord D' Arcy  with his Irish troops led on the pursuit and directed the slaughter The country for the distance of five miles was strewed with carcasses of those who were cut down by their pursuers  Barnes Fordun Boece

The loss of the English is not related with certainty by any Historian Rymer records a note sent by King Edward to direct a public thanks∣giving after this victory in which it is said  that the battle was gained without much loss on his the King's side  This expression implies a loss more considerable than what some authors have set forth viz one Knight one Esquire and foot soldiers  Smollet c c  On the day after the battle  the castle and town of Berwick  was sur∣rendered the King faithfully observing the articles of capitulation A public thanksgiving was ordered through his dominions and he made a donation of l per annum to the Cistercian Nuns near whose con∣vent the battle was fought with full reparation of all damages done to the conventual church and other buildings as the author of the Border History says  thus affecting like most other conquerors to draw Heaven to his party and to regard the success accompanying the most unjust enterprizes as a proof of the peculiar favour of the Deity  King Edward determining to retain Berwick appointed  Lord Henry Percy  Governor of the castle and gave a commission to him and the Earl of March to act as joint Wardens of all the country on this side the Scottish sea where the terms of peace were received He required hostages for Berwick to be chosen out of the chief inhabitants eight of whom he placed at Newcastle and four at York  Edward Baliol did homage to King Edward at Newcastle upon Tyne in June his parliament having ratified the treaty of Roxburgh whereby the castle town and county of Berwick with their appen∣dages were to be annexed to the Crown of England for ever  In the year  Lord John Mowbray  was Governor of Berwick he had in garrison men at arms halberdiers and archers  In King Edward III was at Berwick with an army of foot and horse  In King Edward kept the festival of Easter here and held a tournament in which Knights of Scotland entered the lists with of the King's train This spectacle was exhibited with great magnifi∣cence and solemn pomp but from the animosity which subsisted be∣tween the people of the two nations this exhibition was attended with so much ire and inveteracy and such bitter rivalship that two Scotch Knights were slain and Sir John Twiford an English Knight  On the th of November A D a treaty was held at Berwick for the ransom of  David Bruce King of Scotland  taken prisoner at the battle of  Durham  on the th of October and on the d of  October all the articles of treaty for his deliverance were con∣certed there and the payments of the ransommoney were ordered to be made at Berwick Norham or Bambrough On failure of per∣formance of the former articles another treaty succeeded with a truce for years under which marks were to be paid by yearly in∣stalments of

his French expeditions the Scots surprized the town but the castle sustained their assault from the th of November to the month of January following when King Edward having returned and received the intelligence at the instant of his landing from Calais he tarried in  London only three days before he set forward for Berwick before which place he came on the th day of January with a large army attended by a great naval power with which he laid siege to the town both by sea and land The King entered the castle which still held out for him and meditated a sally at the time his troops began the  assault on other quarters  Sir Walter Manny  with miners brought from the forest of Dean was employed at the same time in advancing a mine below the wall These vigorous measures induced the garrison to surrender the town Some of the Scotch Historians say the garrison on the approach of King Edward's army evacuated the place having  first plundered it and beat down the walls The King added greatly to the fortifications and strengthened the fortress with several new works The surprize of Berwick by the Scotch is spoken of with some incredible circumstances  Steward Earl of Angus  with  Earl March  having collected a powerful navy from different parts of Scotland in which they embarked a chosen band of soldiers entered Tweed in a dark night and landed the forces under the walls unperceived by break of day with scaling ladders they mounted the wall at Cowgate and overpowered the guard after which they soon made themselves masters of the whole town It seems probable there was some treachery in favour of the Scotch assailants  Patric of Dunbar Counte of Marche and Thomas le Seneschal that caulled hymself Counte of Angus one and twenty days after thys prepaired themself apon a nighte with scaling laders cumming to Berwick and with yn VI dayes after tok be assaute one of the stronges toures of Berwik and enterid the town  This tydinges was brought to King Edwarde at his very landing at Calays yn to England Wherfore he taried at his parlament apointed at London but dayes and with al spede cam to Berwike and enterid the castel and then the burgeses tretised with hym and the toune of Berwik was redelyverid ful sore agayn the Scottes wylle to King Edwarde  Lel Col v p  Berwick Castle  afterwards had many changes of possessors In the year seven intrepid and valiant Scots made themselves masters of it in the night killed the Governor  Sir Robert Boynton  and gave li∣berty to his Lady under a ransom of marks But these heroes did not long possess their honourable acquisition for the  Earls of Nor∣thumberland  and  Nottingham  and the  Lords Lucy Neville  and  Stafford  with several other English Nobles soon after invested the place took the fortress by storm and put the Scots to the sword who were in∣creased to the number of but this was not effected till the small garrison had held out eight days against English archers and horse and during the assault lost only two of their number The Nor∣thumbrians soon after ravaged the territories of Lord March in revenge for his destroying the town of Roxburgh The abovementioned sur∣prize was effected in the night before the feast of St Andrew The leader some authors say was the valiant  Sir John Gordon  but the English Historians alledge it was  Alexander Ramsey  When the  Earl of Northumberland  summoned them to surrender they answered with in∣solence  that they would not yield it either to the King of England or Scotland but would retain and defend it for the King of France  In the Scotch gained Berwick by corrupting the Deputy Go∣vernor The  Duke of Lancaster  then in enmity with  Henry Percy  Earl of Northumberland possessing the King's ear improved this circum∣stance greatly to the Earl's disadvantage and he was in consequence attainted of high treason as having been guilty of treachery and con∣sequently his possessions were forfeited The Earl thinking his imme∣diate presence before Berwick was of the first consequence with a nu∣merous army besieged the town but bloodshed was spared by the se∣cret application of marks which regained the place This event operated so powerfully as to gain the King's pardon and restitution to the Earl of his possessions and honours  A D castellum de Berwik a Scottis captum ab Henrico de Percy comite Nor∣thumbr receptumLel Col v p  A conspiracy and insurrection were formed in the year against King Henry IV in which the  Earl of Northumberland  the  Arch∣bishop of York Thomas Mowbray  son of the then Duke of Norfolk He∣reditary Earl Marsh  l  Lord Bardolph  and others were the leaders  The  Earl of Northumberland  could not brook the indignities his Sove∣reign had heaped upon him for beside the grief he sustained in the loss of his son who fell at the battle of  Shrewsbury  and the execution of his brother he had the mortification to see the King's third son John as∣sume the office of High Constable which the King had conferred on the Earl for life with the Wardenship of the East Marches he also was deprived of the office of Warden of the West Marches in favour of the  Earl of Westmoreland  The King demanded the resig∣nation of the castles of  Berwick  and  Jedburgh  and in contempt of the general act of grace for the remission of all offences passed after the battle of  Shrewsbury  sent out commissioners to compound with the Earl's adherents and grant them separate charters The Archbishop and Earl Marshal were apprehended before the Earl of Northumber∣land could join them with his forces and suffered execution at York  The Earl of Northumberland  held the castle of  Berwick  On the King's arrival at Pontefract he ordered a confiscation of all the Earl's estates and commanded the Sheriff of Yorkshire to summon the whole military power of his county to rendezvous at Newcastle The force with which the King proceeded on this expedition was no less than men with engines and artillery for a siege This powerful ar∣mament alarming the Earl with his grandson the son of  Henry Hot∣spur  and  Bardolph  he retired privily from Berwick and took refuge in Scotland  Sir William Greystock  was left to command the fortress King Henry on his march summoned the castle of  Warkworth  to sur∣render but it was not yielded to him till after a siege of eight days when the garrison capitulated on the honourable terms of departing with their horses and accoutrements He made the like summons to the garrison of the castle of  Alnwick  to which he received for answer  Hard p  "That wynne  Berwick  ones he should have his entent" The army advanced to  Berwick  and made the usual preparations for a regular siege whilst the Governor on his part pursued the necessary manoeuvres for a vigorous defence in hopes of receiving succour from Scotland which had been promised him by the Earl on his departure The royal army had some pieces of ordnance engines of destruction which had never before appeared against the fortifications of  Berwick  and which Speed by the authority of Walsingham says were on this occasion for the first time employed in Britain A shot of an enormous size  discharged from a cannon of large bore  The first construction of Cannon was by iron bars bound together with hoops  shattered one of the principal towers which threw the garrison into such consternation that they im∣mediately surrendered The Governor  Sir Henry Bolton  and  Blenkinsop  suffered instant decapitation and the remaining part of the garrison were committed close prisoners  A D comes de Northumb D Bardolf fugerunt de Berwick in Scotiam Rex obsessit castrum de Berwicke expugnavit multos in eo captos decollavit  Lel Col v p  On the royal army's returning  Alnwick Castle  was surrendered by  Henry Percy  of  Athol  and  William Clifford  who had the command on the same terms of capitulation as had been granted to the garrison of  Warkworth  On the demise of King Henry V in France and the accession of his infant son the Scots in the year invaded England The Go∣vernor of Scotland with one army invested  Berwick  whilst  Earl Douglas  with another laid siege to  Roxburgh  but neither of these attempts were attended with success  In Leland's Collectanea  Lel Col v p  are the following notes  Edward Erle of March because King Henry had broken convenauntes was made King

Duke of Excestre the Lord Roos Syr John Fortescue Chief Judge of England and Tailbois Erle of Kyme being at York and hering of this fled first to Newcastelle and then to Berwike delyvering it to the Scottes  Upon a rupture with Scotland in the year the English in the winter laid siege to  Berwick  by sea and land with a great force Part  of the fortifications were then new the same having been constructed by King James III of Scotland after the surrender above mentioned who had expended a large sum in strengthening and rebuilding the walls of the town repairing the castle and furnishing it with a compleat arrangement of artillery The assailants flattered themselves from the newness of the works they should be able to beat them down without much difficulty and easily win the place but although considerable breaches were effected the garrison made so brave a defence that after spending a great part of the winter in carrying on the siege the English were obliged to raise it and retire with disgrace  King Edward IV in the year about the beginning of July marshalled his army at  Alnwick  amounting to men the van of which was led by  Henry Earl of Northumberland  So great a force appearing unexpectedly on the banks of Tweed opposite to  Berwick  the town made no resistance and was immediately seized by the Eng∣lish  Lord Hales  who commanded the  castle  having answered

peace and in the year the truce was renewed and the peace continued for five years  In the year King Henry VIII being dead leaving his son Edward VI an infant of ten years of age the  Earl of Hertford  then created  Duke of Somerset  in the month of August advanced to  Ber∣wick  with an army of men attended by a fleet of ships of war transports and a galley on an expedition to Scotland  See an account of the devastations made on this expedition p  The army lay encamped without the walls of the town  In the year great repairs were made in the fortress of  Berwick  the expence of which with the repairs of Calais are alledged in the King's Journals as the reason for debasing the coin from thence it also appears some of the walls had fallen the foundations having been shaken by working a bulwark Also in the year it appears con∣siderable improvements had been made to the fortifications in which by the minutes of Secretary Cecil  Hayne p  l had been expended The fort then erected was contrived to have four bulwarks for erecting which the wall was to have been left open on the enemy's side for a considerable space but as this was dangerous and expensive it was resolved the wall should be strengthened by an additional wall and two slaughterhouses to scour the outer cu  ains and a great ditch intervening that an other wall fortified in the same manner should be erected within the former  Sir Nicholas Sturley  appears to have been nominated Captain of this new fort  Alexander Brett  Porter and one  Rokesby  Marshal No vestiges of these works now appearing it is to be presumed they were rased when Queen Elizabeth put the fortifica∣tions upon a regular and modern plan  In the reigns of King Edward VI and Queen Mary of Scotland  Berwick  by treaty was made  a county town  and as Rymer's Faedra notes it "a free town independant of both states"  In the year  Lord Wharton  in his reports to the Lord President of the North says the ordinary officers of the town appointed by let∣ters patent were a Captain a Marshal a Treasurer a Chamberlain a Porter and a Master of the Ordnance These with the Mayor for the year were counsellors for the town each having a yearly salary and pay for attendants  In the year Queen Mary of Scotland came into the neighbour∣hood to view  Berwick  she was met at the extreme of the liberties by the Deputy Governor and his train who conducted her first to  Hallidon Hill  and thence to the west of the town where she had a perfect view of the place and was saluted by a general discharge of the ordnance  In King James VI of Scotland did the like and received the same salute  Queen Elizabeth having fortified  Berwick  made the following mili∣tary establishment there in the year as appears by the archieves of the borough  The garrison consisted of eight companies of musqueteers two of them containing and the rest men each the pay of the private men d per day Captains of larger companies s of lesser companies s horsemen under command of eight constables the horsemen had d per day added to their former pay of l s d per annum The gunners were augmented on account of the great additional num∣ber of large ordnance from

the Customer l and the Comptroller of the Customs l  The Master of the Ordnance had under his charge more than ar∣tificers employed for service of the garrison among these was one  Bowyer  one  Fletcheur  or arrowmaker and one  Master Wheeler  The whole number of men on this establishment was and their pay amounted to the yearly sum of l s d  In the year on the demise of Queen Elizabeth King James VI of Scotland was proclaimed March th at this place King of Eng∣land France and Ireland by the name of King James I In the archieves of Berwick is kept a copy of the letter wrote by the Mayor  Aldermen and Commons dated on the above day informing the King  they had with present expedition and with what solemnity the leisure of time would afford published and proclaimed his sacred Majesty King of England France and Ireland and entreats him to pardon such defects as by ignorance omission or otherwise by the straitness of time had happened in the performance thereof  To which the King

received with every demonstration of duty and welcome by  Sir John Carey  then Marshal accompanied by the officers of the garrison their several corps of horse and foot were marshalled in due order and on the King's passing saluted him with a  feu de joy  which was return∣ed by a discharge of the artillery on the ramparts The roads were lined with people who on all sides joined in the loudest acclamations  When his Majesty entered the gate the keys of the town were deli∣vered to him by  William Selby  Gentleman Porter who was immedi∣ately knighted and the keys were returned In the marketplace he was met by the body corporate of the borough  Hugh Gregson  the Mayor presented him with an offering of gold and surrender of their charter after which the Recorder made a speech of congratulation these the King received most graciously at the same time restoring the charter and promising his royal favour and protection The King proceeded to the church to return thanks for his peaceful entry into his new dominions when  Toby Mathews Bishop of Durham  preached an  excellent sermon From thence his Majesty went to the  castle  the ordnance were again discharged and the streets reechoed with accla∣mations of joy On the following day the King received several of the English Nobles among whom were  Lord Cobham  and  Henry Howard  brother of the Duke of Norfolk who came to Berwick to pay their duty to their new Sovereign his Majesty inspected the fortifications magazines and port and at the head of the garrison drawn out and under arms with his own hands discharged a

appear in more favourable language than contained in the adver∣tisement given in the note  Published in the Newcastle newspaper Oct  The public Grammar School of Berwick upon Tweed being vacant by the resignation of the late master the Guild has determined to fill the employment by the most deserving man they can find to undertake the charge  Notice is hereby given that the said employment will be disposed of on Thursday the th of December next at Berwick where the candidates are desired at that day to make their personal appearance  The corporation being duly sensible of the high importance of the charge and how much the principles of the society may be corrupted their morals debauched and the public peace disturbed by the jacobitism bigotry loose morals imprudence or ill temper of the

salmon fishery here is very considerable Mr Pennant speaks of it in the following terms  They lay on each side the river and are all private property except what belongs to the Dean and Chapter of Durham which in rent and tithe of fish brings in l per annum for all the other fisheries are liable to tithe The common rents of these are l a year for which tenants have as much shore as serves to launch out and draw their nets on shore the limits of each are staked and I observed that the fishers never failed going as near as possible to their neighbour's limits One man goes off in a small flatbottomed  boat square at one end and taking as large a circuit as his net admits brings it on shore at the extremity of his boundary where others assist in landing it The best fishery is on the south side very fine salmon trout are often taken here which come up from the sea to spawn and return in the same manner as the salmon do For a fuller account of this fishery vide British Zoology III To it may also be added that in the middle of the river not a mile west of the town is a large stone on which a man is placed to observe what is called the  Reck  of the salmon coming up  Historians have differed greatly in the etymology of the name of  Berwick  Camden seems to determine in favour of the Saxon  the town of  the Bernicians  After having mentioned the evidences of antiquity it is requisite before I quit the subject I should speak of  Berwick  in its natural state Being built on an angular point of land at the mouth of Tweed on two sides it is bounded by water the sea in this part of the channel is tempestuous and rough the tide setting in very strong occasions a heavy surge which increased by frequent storms renders the coast tre∣mendous The prospect of the ocean conveys to the contemplative mind a grand association of images which describe the might and majesty of the Creator As I walked the banks imagination roved at large but took a melancholy strain I conceived I heard the alarm guns fired at Bambrough Castle and the signal of distress waved in my Fancy's eye from some vessel at a distance The ocean which before had affected my soul with a scene of magnificent delight now seemed full of horror and dismay the rolling billows became tremendous the yawning gulph an object of gloomy terror the whole conveyed the apprehension of imminent peril and distress and in the end all the agonies of a distracted crew who laboured for life filled my imagina∣tion and the wanderings of Fancy were replete with dismay and misery  The inhabitants of  Berwick  have enough of such horrid scenes the coast is terrible to mariners After having once been witness to so me∣lancholy an event one would scarce ever look upon the sea again with pleasure  The Land Prospect  doth not produce a scene wild enough to be called romantic or sufficiently cultivated to be smooth placid and agreeable  The banks of Tweed loss much of their sweetness in the environs of the town and Flora reserves most of her beauties for the neighbourhood of  Kelso  and  Coldstream  Below Berwick bridge there is not enough either of trade or tranquillity it possesses the middle station neither busy enough nor enough at rest is dulness Above bridge in the fishing season the scene is beautifully enlivened Below some few vessels are moored but too often the heavy hulks are turned up on the dry sands with masts unrigged waiting for trade and tide Such are dull objects to the eye and have no other effect upon the spectator than to promote weariness and impatiency  Over the arm of the sea which breaks upon the bar of Tweed the lands to the southward are extended for several miles upon the view varied with the happy colourings which succeed to cultivation but the distance is so great that objects are indistinct and the beauties of the landskip lay in confusion two often indeed the whole is enveloped in sea vapour  I cannot take my departure from the banks of Tweed without passing some few thoughts on the carnage and bloodshed which for ages ren∣dered them famous to the arms of both the Scotch and English and to posterity made their history a subject of horror and detestation  Alberic Bishop of Ostia being sent as Legate from Pope Innocent II on his visitation at Carlisle is said to have taken great pains to remon∣strate to the army of King David of Scotland after the retreat from the battle of Alerton that they ought to wage war with greater humanity and prevailed with them so far as to gain the release of the female cap∣tives whom they were carrying as slaves into Scotland He also ob∣tained their solemn engagement that in future inroads they would not violate the churches and religious houses and would also spare from the sword women infants and the aged These shew to us what were the infamous enormities committed in these expeditions  The war carried on between the two nations was as brutal as any in the annals of the Caribbees or any savages under the sun The pub∣lic injuries of states the policy of empires the balance of trade the peace of Europe or the equilibrium of power were not the objects of warfare like the wild Arabs the estate of the people was that of rob∣bers rapine and plunder their objects as if devoid of all religious sense  of oaths and moral obligations the compacts of states and the ties of honour and moral honesty they often forsook every principle for plun∣der and like barbarians levied war for the sake of pillaging of re∣prisal and retribution When the wolves descend the Alps upon the villages it is the effect of hunger in its extreme but here the blood of the peasant was shed without any cogency of cause but the lucre of his herds flocks and possessions The immortal  King John  burnt laid waste and destroyed half the island from York northward Alexander in all his glory never exhibited a more noble conflagration Edward contaminated his honours with many of those atchievements Torrents of blood have issued from these borders they were the common char∣nel of the two nations Thirtythree thousand souls fled in one day to the gates of eternity dispatched by the command of Princes who could not account to heaven what it was they fought for The petit massacres were equally as inconsiderate the heroes of those bands walked forth with their adherents imbruing their hands in human gore burning and destroying laying waste towers towns and villages and spreading deso∣lation in the most savage manner for the reward of savages reciprocal slaughters devastations and cruelties marked both people When the most valiant atchievements were performed even in the presence of their Princes revenge appeared to be the only instigation and common justice was seldom considered What was the battle of Allerton in the reign of Stephen when David with a mighty slaughter was overthrown after having ravaged Northumberland and Durham returning like a dis∣appointed miscreant with his hands red in the blood of thousands of his band of robbers William King of Scotland was a prisoner on one of his incursions he witnessed a cruel slaughter of his people Our Edward I slew at Falkirk Edward III slew his tens of thousands at Hallydown Hill and Penrith and Durham witnessed to the succeeding de∣struction made of the Scots in this reign under their unfortunate David who in the battle at the lastmentioned place was made prisoner The battles of Otterburn and Flodden Field were upon the same principles as the othersHow doth this retrospection fully the hero stain the lustre of his arms and the honour of his valour yet it is too true such were the conflicts on the borders and such the arms that waged the inglorious warfare on this once wretched but now most happy coun∣try at this time abounding with wealth flowing from peace by the channels of cultivation manufactory and trade where the brethren of one climate and one island under the blessed protection of one com∣mon father and a constitution admired and envied by all the world  are acting together in a state of mutual offices to contribute to the general opulence and felicity  How baneful and obnoxious is he to the common interests of this now united family who attempts to sow the seeds of dissatisfaction and jealousy and through calumnies arising in the venom of malevo∣lence and disappointed ambition endeavours to cultivate contempt and aversion between the brethren of this land The strength of this and every nation is the union of its inhabitantshe who blows up the embers of extinguished feuds is particularly an enemy to both parties and a foe to the state at large  The accession of King James the VI to the Crown of England ope∣rated powerfully towards the felicity of this part of the island cultiva∣tion immediately took place the country so often desolated by war received new inhabitants who brought with them not only flocks and herds but also manufactories and commerce the works effected in peace were soon distinguished the barren wastes were put under the plough share towns and hamlets diversified the scene and increasing population enlivened every valley which for ages had been marked by works of hostility Yet it was not till the union of the two kingdoms that these effects of peace were brought to the happy eminence now discovered on every hand As to political advantages it is evident their discussion comes not within my plan in this work I am per∣suaded of their vast importance to both nations Mrs Macauley says  on very sound principles of policy the union had been several times rejected by both nations and which was with great difficulty coerced on the Scots though as Burnet observes the advantages which were offered to Scotland in the whole frame of it were great and visible The Scots were to bear less than the fortieth part of the public taxes and they were to have the eleventh part of the legisla∣ture Trade was to be free all over the island and to the plantations private rights were to be preserved and the judicature and laws of Scotland were still to be continued  Lord Marchmont  having been pointed at by Historians as being one of those corrupt par∣tizans who effected the  union  from sinister views the following  authentic letter  in the  author  's custody among many state papers found in the cabinet of the late  Lord Wharton  will be thought worthy a place here To which some historical notes c are added  From the Earl of Marchmont to Lord Wharton  Nov  Edinburgh  MY LORD  I had the honour of your Lordship's letter of the st July last by the Lord Ross who did me the kindness to call at my house on his way to Edinburgh and gave me the satisfactory account of your Lordship's hearty inclinations to the union and of your prudent diligence to advance it in the treaty such as I would have expected from your understanding and parts  I have been long wishing an opportunity to assist in that design being convinced that an union of the kingdoms is the only solid way to secure the religion and liberty  The Duke of Hamilton's speech was spirited  What shall we in one day give up what our forefathers maintained with their lives and fortunes for many ages Are here none of the descendants of those worthy pa∣triots who defended the liberty of their country against all invaders who assisted the great King Robert Bruce to restore the constitution and revenge the falsehood of England and usurpation of Pa  ol Where are the Douglasses and Campbe  ls Where are the Peers where are the Barons once the bulwark of the nation Shall we yield up the sovereignty and independency of our country when we are commanded by those we represent to preserve the same and assured of their assistance to support us  to increase the power and significancy of this island and to establish the peace of it  I would have written to your Lordship sooner but delayed till I might observe the motions of our parliament I had discovered some time ago that in all corners of the country endea∣vours were used to possess the people with fears about it and great prejudices against it as if it would bring slavery upon them destroy the little trade they have and make them miserable beyond a possibility of remedy  The processors were the Duke of Athol Earl Marshal Marquis of Annandale Lord Belhaven Earl of Buchan Lockhart of Carnwarth Sir Walter Stuart the Earl of Errol and some of inferior rank  Those who promoted the union were headed by the Dukes of Queensberry and Argyle the Earls of Montrose Seafield and Stair  Smollet says  they found means partly by their promises and partly by corruption to bring over the Earls of Ro  burgh and  Marchment  with the whole squadron who had hitherto been unpropitious to the Court  From this letter the reader must entertain a more favourable idea of its author  but especially that it would overturn the church government established here which the people are so addicted to that they can suffer as much for it as I think they would for Christianity itself  Some had influenced the most part of our preachers to whom the people have great regard that it is scarcely possible to persuade them to a true notion of the union or to any good thoughts of it though there has been much pains taken by others to do it  When the parliament met it was easy to find out who had been the somenters of the fears and doubts causing the aversion and it is evident enough the opposers in parliament have been the authors of very bad impressions upon the clergy and lower people  Mr Fleming's Voyage to Scotland printed with Hook's Negotiation says  The same evening I arrived at Lord Nai  ns in the county of Perth who expressed great zeal for the service of the K and as I had a letter of the Earl of Errol for him that he might inform me of the most proper measures to see his brother the Mar∣quis of Athol he undertook to conduct me to him We found that Lord in such a temper as we could wish for five months before he had all his vassals ready to take arms upon the first news o  the K's arrival  In this collection we have the two following letters  From the Earl of Errol Lord High Constable of Scotland  Stains  th May  May it please your M  The satisfaction which I feel on receiving your M's orders answers to my zeal and hopes of being one day  in your service I have left nothing undone to restore your My to the throne of your ancestors and though our design of doing it by the parliament has not had the success your faithful subjects wished for  yet the arrival of Colonel Hooke and his diligence in the execution of his orders have been so useful that I hope in consequence thereof to have the happiness of seeing your My in this country an happiness after which we have so long sighed to be delivered from oppression Most of your M's friends having left Edinburgh before the arrival of Colonel Hooke all that we could do was to act in concert in signing the memorial and as the memorial is not so ample as some of us could have wished we have desired the Colonel to supply what is wanting therein by representing several things concerning which we have instructed him He will also inform your M how much this nation is generally well affected to your service and with how much pleasure we shall venture our lives and fortunes for so just a cause No one will concur more heartily than I who constantly pray for your M's prosperity I am  May it please your My Your M's most faithful subject and most obedient most humble servant Signed ERROL  Extract of the letter from the Countess of Errol to the Queen of England May th  All the delays which we have suffered have not diminished our zeal though they have prolonged our mise∣ries and misfortunes  Colonel Hooke has been so well received among us that he is able to give an exact account of his negotia∣tions which will not displease your M  I confess that after having waited for him for a long while our servour began to diminish in proportion to our hopes but his prudence and good conduct joined to his indefatigable diligence has revived our ardor and he has put our affairs into so good order that we hope they will come to an happy issue The present opportunity is looked upon by all as the best that has ever offered and the last that will offer for a long time  All ranks of people earnestly demand their K and the Scots will certainly return universally and unani∣mously to their duty towards their lawful S  Though the relations of Mr Murray are very considerable and able to do much for your M's service yet he has not thought proper to promote it in the country on account of the situation he is in with respect to the government beside Colonel Hooke's activity has been such that he has not stood in need of assistance How∣ever Mr Murray has always been ready to do every thing in his power and has followed exactly the advice of the Colonel c c  yet I am of opinion that the fancies they have taken up will soon vanish and will not be the hinderance of con∣cluding a treaty  Upon the th current the house came to a question  Approve the first article of the treaty or not  With this provision that if other articles be not adjusted by the parliament the agreeing to the first should be of no effect  The voters present were of which were approvers were opposers of these entered their dissent and protested would not join in the dissent because they differed from the approvers only in that they were not for putting a question upon the first article till votes should pass on the th th and some other following articles and I think the most part of if not all the are for an entire union if the terms please them  Several very understanding and well affected members find difficulties in some of the articles whereof they apprehend some to be insuperable unless they meet with a remedy from the wisdom of England  Many of the more judicious members are little moved by the cross humour raised among the people by the pains of illdesigning men while it is founded only upon speculation for they think that will vanish But if the mulitude of the lower people shall at the beginning feel a sensible prejudice by the execution of any article then the danger may prove greater among a hot stubborn vulgar than can well be foreseen  I cannot yet condescend upon particulars which I will do when I am able to explain them more distinctly this I can say in the general that I am only apprehensive of such things as may universally affect the common people before they can have much relish of the advantages which certainly will in course be the product and fruit of an union  In the beginning of this session those who in the last were called the new party made up of the Peers and Gentlemen who were laid aside from public employment and the council in the year and others their friends upon whom they have influence who have still stuck toge∣ther above in number were suspected that they would go cross to the Ministers but God  be thanked they have not done so for which they merit esteem and thanks from all who wish well to her Majesty and her kingdoms They have carried themselves and concurred as persons of honour and understanding for promoting the common good without any appearance of resentment towards those now employed Whereas if they had joined with the opposers of the union the promoters of it here were not able to carry it through  As for the  protesters  I am confident the far greater part if not all of them are designing to make way for the ST GERMAINS YOUTH and to divide these kingdoms  Voltaire speaking of the Tories attempting to replace the Stuart family on the throne of England is thus noted by his translator Smollet  We can affirm on the very best authority that the Tories never harboured any such design there might indeed be some Jacobites among them who secretly entertained notions of that kind but these they carefully concealed from the party with which they associated Some too were driven into Jacobitism by hard usage but the Tories in general had no intention to alter that succession which they them∣selves had established  They well discern that an union extinguishes all hopes of that sort and therefore they will certainly em∣brace any means that can prevent an union But as the friends to it cannot miss to outvote the other if insuperable difficulties of the kind I have mentioned be not found in some of the articles or if found be removed or redressed by the prudent assistance of your Lordship and such as you in your parliament I doubt not the treaty will be brought to a happy conclusion which I heartily wish and wherein I shall labour to be as much assistant here as can be in the power of  MY LORD  Your Lordship's most obedient and most humble servant Signed MARCHMONT  Turn over  If your Lordship n  eds to write to me the gentleman who delivers this has a way to have it brought with certainty to me  My shaking hand serves me not to write therefore I make use in this of my son Sir Andrew's  November  MY LORD  The difficulties and warm debates which happened in the house led me to delay the sending my letter till I could give you this further account  The d d and th articles of the treaty are approved with the like provision as the first is but the carrying of these votes was with a great deal of wrangle and contest even as much upon the th wherein we expected little resistance as upon any of the former whereby it is easy to discern the design of the opposers Yet our greater difficulty is to keep many by whom we must carry our votes from being misled by the designing opposers with the subtle pretences they make so plausible as are of danger to prevail upon the less understanding sort of wellmeaning persons  The th article is this day approved with this alteration  The Diet is changed from the time of signing the treaty for the union to the time of ratifying the treaty  "I know not how your parliament may like this but I am hopeful that an affair of so ma∣nifold advantages to this island as an entire union may prove will not stop upon differences of lesser moment  What I foresee of this sort brings to my remembrance a very old treaty betwixt Reheboam and the tribes of Israel and of the wise advice which the old Counsellors gave him This similitude halts as commonly all do yet I believe your Lordship will find something in it that may be of use  I shall add no more now but that I am  Your Lordship's humble servant Signed M E  Whether the security pretended to be obtained by England by this union was worth purchasing at so high a price whether the union  has answered the expectations of those who prophefied that it would be the means of extending the bounds of the British empire and of  enlarging the happiness of its citizens by cementing in the closest bands of friendship two nations who had ever regarded each other  with the eyes of jealousy and aversion will be differently deter∣mined by men who from their different connections in both or either countries have contracted different prejudices but whether as the series of these times predicted it will be attended with conse∣quences no less fatal than the destruction of the laws and constitution of England the space of a very few years will in all probability determine beyond a doubt  We passed by the sands to  HOLY ISLAND  the morning was calm the sea smooth and the land prospect gilded with the sun very beautiful though not much variegated  The description given of this island Symeon p is to the follow∣ing purport  That in circumference it comprehends eight miles in which was a noble  Monastery  famous for its Prelates among whom was  St Cuthbert  whose bodies were there deposited and whose me∣mory would live for ever It hath the name of  Lindisfarn  from a small rivulet called  Lindis  which from the opposite continent empties itself into the sea"  In Mr Grose's works we find these particulars relative to this Island  Bede calls it a Semi Island being as he justly observes twice an island and twice continent in one day for at the flowing of the tide it is encompassed by water and at the ebb there is an almost dry passage both for horses and carriages to and from the main land from which if measured in a straight line it is distant about two miles eastward but on account of some quick sands passengers are obliged to make so many detours that the length of the way is nearly doubled the water over these flats at spring tides is only seven feet  This island was by the Britons called  Inis Medicante  also  Lindisfarn  from the small rivulet of  Lindi  which here runs into the sea and the Celtic word  Fahren  or recess also on account of its being the habitation of some of the first monks in this country it afterwards obtained its present name of  Holy Island  It measures from east to west about two miles and a quarter and its breadth from north to south is scarcely a mile and a half At the northwest part there runs out a spit of land of about a mile in length The  Monastery  is situated at the southermost extremity and a small distance north of it stands the little town inhabited chiefly by fishermen This island though really part of  Northumberland  belongs to  Durham  and all civil disputes must be determined by the justices of that county  By Bede it is described "Qui locus accedente ac recedente reumate bis quotidiae instar insulae maris circumluitur undis bis renudato littore contiguus terrae redditur  Lindis dicitur flumen quod in mare excurrit duorum pedum latitudinem habens quando Ledon fuerit id est minor aestus videri potest Quando vero Malina fuerit id est major aestus maris tum nequit Lindis videri Farne autem insula est in qua beatissimus Cuthbertus heremitican invitam duxit Non tanta est Lindisfarne sed est posita in mare magnis exturbata fluctibus dicbus NoctibusLel Col v p  There is one small farm of cultivated land upon the island with some few acres of good pasture ground capable of improvement and the rest by the violence of tempests is covered with sand The island chiefly consists of one continued plain inclining to the southwest The land on which the village stands rises swiftly from the shore at the southern point is a rock of a conical figure and almost perpendicular near feet in height having on its lofty crown a small fortress or castle which makes at once a grotesque and formidable appearance I did not observe one tree upon the island  HOLY ISLAND  depiction of Holy Island  The village consists of a few scattered houses two of which are Inns the rest chiefly inhabited by fishermen The shore is excellent for bathing and the situation at once healthy and romantic it is surprising it should be so little resorted to The north and east coasts of the island are formed of perpendicular rocks the other sides sink by gradual de∣clinations towards the sands The rock on which the castle stands is accessible only by a winding pass cut on its southern side the narrow limits of its crown will not admit of many works the whole strength consisting of a single battery on the southeast point mounted with seven or eight guns which commands the approach to the island from the sea but would be of little consequence against a ship of any con∣siderable force The rest of the summit is taken up with a house for the Governor and guard the walls of which stand on the very brink of the precipice This fortress before the use of gunpowder from its  situation appears to have been impregnable the superstructures being above the reach of any engine and the rocks too high to be scaled The antiquity of this  castle  is not known but I should presume it is coeval with the  abbey  and was used as a place of resort in times of peril and a stronghold for the religious whenever they were disturbed in their holy retreat The present fortifications appear to be the work of the last century In the military establishment made by Queen Eliza∣beth for  Berwick  in the castle is noted and a patent for life was granted to  Sir William Read  as keeper of the fortresses of  Holy Island  and  Farn  with a yearly payment of l s d per annum  The ingenious Mr Grose gives the following anecdotes relative to this castle  Camden mentions it so that it is evidently as old as his time Probably it has been the scene of very few remarkable events history being nearly as silent with respect to them as concerning its origin The first time it occurs is in the history of the civil war in the time of Charles I when it appears to have been seized for the Parliament and according to Rushworth in an order of the House of Commons May th for sending forces thither this reason is assigned "it being of such consequence to the northern parts of the kingdom Probably this consequence arose more for the conve∣nience of its harbour than the strength of the castle"  In the year one Captain Batton was Governor of the island for the Parliament to whom Sir Marmaduke Langdale after the taking of Berwick wrote the following letter but without success The letter together with the Captain's refusal were transmitted to the House of Commons for which they voted their thanks to Captain Batton and that he should be continued Governor of the place  Sir you have the good opinion of the counties to be a sober discreet man amongst them which emboldeneth me a stranger to you to propose that which every man in his duty to God and the King ought to perform the veil of these horrid designs plotted by some that men may run and read the misery and thraldom they intend upon the whole nation It is believed by many that know you that you are sensible of the imprisonment of his Majesty and the violation of all our laws If you please to consider the ends being changed perhaps for which you first engaged and comply with the King's interest by keeping the fort now in possession for the King's use I will engage myself to see all the arrears due to yourself and the soldiers duly  paid and to procure his Majesty's favour for the future and that I only may receive some satisfaction from you that this motion is as really accepted as intended by  Your humble servant MARMADUKE LANGDALE  Berwick  April th  Holy Island does not appear ever to have fallen into the hands of the Royalists for it continued in the possession of the Parliamenta∣rians anno when it was as may be seen in Rushworth re∣lieved with necessaries by Colonel Fenwick's horse and some dragoons From that time nothing memorable seems to have been transacted here till the rebellion in the year when the seizure of this castle was planned and performed by two men only In which ex∣ploit such policy and courage were exerted as would have done them much honour had they been employed in a better cause The following particulars of the story were communicated by a Gentleman whose father was an eyewitness to the facts and well knew both the parties  One Lancelot Errington a man of an ancient and respectable fa∣mily in Northumberland and of a bold and enterprizing spirit en∣tered into a conspiracy for seizing this castle for the Pretender in which it is said he was promised assistance not only by Mr Forster the rebel General then in arms but also by the masters of several French privateers At this time the garrison consisted of a serjeant a corporal and or men only In order to put this scheme in execution being well known in that country he went to the castle and after some discourse with the serjeant invited him and the rest of the men who were not immediately on duty to partake of a treat on board of the ship of which he was master then lying in the har∣bour this being unsuspectingly accepted of he so well plied his guests with brandy that they were soon incapable of any opposition These men being thus secured he made some pretence for going on shore and with Mark Errington his nephew returning again to the castle they knocked down the centinel surprized and turned out an old gunner the corporal and two other soldiers being the remain∣der of the garrison and shutting the gates hoisted the Pretender's colours as a signal of their success anxiously expecting the promised succours No reinforcement coming but on the contrary a party of the King's troops arriving from Berwick they were obliged to retreat  over the walls of the castle among the rocks hoping to conceal them∣selves under the sea weeds till it was dark and then by swimming to the main land to make their escape but the tide rising they were obliged to swim when the soldiers firing at Lancelot as he was climb∣ing up a rock wounded him in the thigh Thus disabled he and his nephew were taken and conveyed to Berwick gaol where they con∣tinued till his wound was cured During this time he had digged a burrow quite under the foundations of the prison depositing the earth taken out in an old oven Through this burrow he and his nephew with divers other prisoners escaped but most of the latter were soon after taken The two Erringtons however had the good fortune to make their way to the Tweedside where they found the customhouse boat they rowed themselves over and afterwards turned it adrift From thence they pursued their journey to Bam∣brough Castle near which they were concealed nine days in a pea∣stack a relation who resided in the castle supplying them with pro∣vision At length travelling in the night by secret paths they reached Gateshead House near Newcastle where they were secreted till they procured a passage from Sunderland to France A reward of l was now offered to any one who would apprehend them notwith∣standing which Lancelot was so daring as soon after to come into England and even to visit some of his friends in Newgate After the suppression of the rebellion when every thing was quiet he and his nephew took the benefit of the general pardon and returned to Newcastle where he died about the year as it is said of grief at the victory of Culloden  The remains of the old  abbey  in the next place require my attention such parts of this cathedral are standing as give a perfect idea of its original form and appearance The  monastery  is in ragged ruins and not worthy to be delineated the walls having been robbed for the build∣ings in the village and the erection of the present parochial church  It is said by some authors that the  monastery  was built by  St Cuthbert  of a plain model without ornament and enclosed with a high wall in order that outward objects might not withdraw the attention of the so∣ciety from their divine contemplations  In Mr West's Antiquities of  Furness Abbey  we have this short account of the rise and origin of Monastic Orders  Soon after the christian  religion had made some considerable progress in the east the policy of the Roman empire exposed the professors of it to many and great in∣conveniencies and a succession of bloody persecutions the two last under Decius and Dioclesian more especially obliged many to betake themselves to mountains deserts and solitary places to secure them∣selves from the unrelenting fury of these bloody tyrants there they found a safe retreat with time and liberty to give themselves up to the exercises of piety and divine contemplation in a course of most rigorous mortifications and preternatural austerities This kind of life which necessity gave rise to was afterwards in the time of the Christian Emperors embraced through choice and  Pacomius  about the middle of the th century committed to writing rules for regu∣lar societies and founded some monasteries in the environs of Thebes in Egypt  The introduction of Monks into England is spoken of as a masterpiece of policy in the court of Rome as endeavouring thereby to secure her authority by an increase of property which would arise to her by the pious donations and offerings of the faithful and the founding of many religious houses to be occupied by such as were from the nature of their institute attached to the Holy See and might occasionally serve every purpose of spiritual tyranny And it is alledged that the Monks by the austerity of their religion and morals fascinated the minds of the people and by their pretension to extra∣ordinary sanctity secured a submission to all their decisions and an implicit obedience to all their doctrines This is a heavy charge and if well grounded should have prevented the monastic rule from ever taking effect in any kingdom or occasioned its ruin as soon as the discovery was made or the charge formed  This he obviates by monasteries being established here before Austin's time and takes for his authorities Gildas and Bede as to their being schools of christian learning He adds  in all this we hear nothing of foreign connections of sinister inventions or hypocrisy  The Roman Pontiff knew how to draw from the circumstances of William's afrairs advantages which the Conqueror never intended and which his immediate successors could not prevent as they were equally or more obliged to the church for her support than he himself had been The foreign Ecclesiastics which the Norman King  LINDISFARN N Aspect  depiction of Lindisfarn Abbey  introduced readily gave up the liberty of a country to which they were strangers and a happiness the sweets whereof they had never known but from that consequence of which the Conqueror and his sons had made them they soon became sensible of ther own impor∣tance the foreign Monks from the great property conferred upon them soon found of what weight they were in the scale of govern∣ment and readily turned it to their own advantages as occasion of∣fered  The introduction therefore of so many new orders of Monks into England by the Norman Kings was according to their own policy and not that of the Court of Rome  He then takes occasion to men∣tion the good offices of the church in favour of the Conqueror's younger sons and the Earl of Moreton and King John  The Court of Rome could have no direct hand in all this and the monastick institute of its own nature can have no part in either a civil or a spiritual tyranny unless where perverted as the best of institutes may have been by the malice of men  I have been led to lengthen the quotation beyond the bounds I at first intended to shew with what arguments this subtle author and other writers of the like class can put a plausible countenance on facts which reflected disho∣nour on the See of Rome But to return from this digression  The cathedral is in the form of a cross the east and west limbs of which are yet standing the other parts totally in ruins and almost level with the ground The order of building in this structure is rude and heavy and most of it in the worst mode of the early Saxon architecture Mr Grose says  probably it was the work of different periods great part of it seems very ancient the arches being circular and the co∣lumns very massy and much like those at Durham but richer On the north and south walls there are pointed arches which proves that part of it at least was built since the reign of Henry II  The pil∣lars on which the arches rise in the center of the cross are clustered and plain capitalled each forming the corner of the great tower these arches are of few members There are two side ailes the columns of which are heavy and the arches circular the windows are nar∣row and ornamented with a corner pilaster and a moulding of few members the walls are very thick and every part wears a gloomy countenance The south wall of the middle tower is standing about  feet high and one corner tower on the west end of the church remains perfect  The cathedral with the town of Fenham and the town and church of Norham were given by William de Carilepho to the monastery of Durham Monast Angl Vol  These ruins retain at this day one most singular beauty the tower has not formed a lanthorn as in most cathedrals but from the angles arches sprang crossing each other diagonally to form a canopy roof One of those arches yet remains unloaded with any su∣perstructure supported by the southeast and northwest corner pillars and ornamented with the dancette or zigzag moulding much used in old Saxon architecture extending a fine bow over the chasm and heap of ruins occasioned by the fallingin of the ailes The whole structure is composed of a soft red freestone which yields much to time and renders the aspect of the building dark and melancholy Mr Grose's account comprehends the following particulars  Various fragments of the offices of this monastery are still stand∣ing and foundations of buildings are scattered over a close of near four acres the main walls of the church on the north and south sides are still standing though much out of the perpendicular inclining outwards so considerably as to make the horizontal distance between them at the top exceed by near two feet that at the bottom Ano∣ther winter or two seems to be the utmost they can stand  This building consists of a body and two side ailes into which it is divided by a double row of very solid columns whose shafts are richly ornamented Each row has five columns of four different con∣structions and two pilasters in the walls on the east and west ends The shafts of these columns are about feet high their diameters about five their capitals and pedestals are plain they support circular arches having over each arch two ranges of windows the lowest large and in pairs separated only by a short column the upper small and single The length of the building is about feet the breadth of the body feet and that of the two side ailes about nine feet each  The prospect from this island is beautiful to the northward you command the town of  Berwick  over an arm of the sea about seven miles in breadth at nearly the same distance you view  Bambrough Castle  on a bold  promontory  towards the south on the one hand you have a  view of the open sea at the time of our observation calm and resplen∣dent and scattered over with vessels and on the other hand a narrow channel by which the land is insulated about two miles in width the distant shore exhibits a beautiful hanging landskip of cultivated coun∣try graced with a multitude of cottages villages and

small spot of ground thereabout being sick he erected a hut close to the wall on the west side of the church In this place he gave up the ghost on the last day of August in the th year of his

to promote the christian religion To this effect he sent his Embassadors unto Donald IV then reigning in Scotland and entreated him by the old familiarity that had been among them to help him with some worthy and learned men that could instruct his people in the faith of Christ The King recommending the matter to the Clergy one  Cormanus  was elected to go thither but his labours proving unprofitable he returned about the end of the year and in a synod of the Bishops and Clergy informed them that they were a people so  indocile and froward  that the pains taken upon them were lost they neither being desirous nor capable of instruction  It grieved the synod exceedingly to hear this and while they were consulting what to do  Aidanus  a learned man and reverend preacher is said to have advised them not to give over the work at any hands for that the bad success of  Cormanus  's labours might possibly proceed from himself that had not used the people tenderly nor according to the Apostle's rules  fed them at first with milk  and therefore desired some other approved man might be employed of new who would probably do good among them  This opinion allowed by all none was thought fitter for this service than he who had given the advice and so with common consent was  Aidan  ordained Bishop and appointed to that charge Being come thither he set himself to amend the fault which he supposed  Corman  had committed and so tempered his doctrine as multitudes of people daily did resort unto him to be instructed It was great hinderance unto him at first that he was not skilled in the  Saxon  tongue neither did the people understand his language but this defect the King himself sup∣plied interpreting to the auditory all that  Aidanus  delivered in his sermon so by the King's zeal and  Aidanus  's diligence such numbers were brought to the christian profession as in the space of seven days persons were by him baptized  Whether this people were more happy in their King or in this Bishop it is difficult to say for the King he did so excel in piety and prudence that as  Beda  writes all the nations and provinces within Britain were at his devotion and not the less his heart was never lifted up within him but still he shewed himself courteous and affable and of the poor most compassionate Among examples of his liberality towards these the same  Beda  related that sitting at table on Easterday and  Aidanus  by him when it was told that a number of poor men were at the gate expecting his alms he commanded to carry the meat that was set before him unto them and the platter of silver wherein it was to be broke in pieces and distributed among them  Ai∣danus  beholding it took the King by the right hand and kissing it said  "Nunquam marcesca haec manus"  never let this hand consume or wither which as he writeth came also to pass for being killed in battle and his arm and his hand cut off the same was enclosed in a silver shrine and remained for many years uncorrupted in the church of St Peter at  Bambrough  As to  Aidanus  he was an ensample of abstinence sobriety chastity charity and all other episcopal virtues for as he taught so he lived was idle at no time nor did he admit any of his retinue to be so but kept them in a continual exercise either reading scripture or learning the psalms of David by heart If he was invited to any feast as rarely he went he made no stay but after a little refreshment taken got himself away In preaching he was most diligent travelling through the country for the greater part on foot and instructing the people where∣soever he came In a word he was deficient in no duty required of a good Pastor and having governed the church in those parts most happily the space of years he died in the

are too honourable to be omitted observation here Their frugality simplicity of life and par∣simony appeared in the place of their residence in which there was no∣thing unnecessary or unadapted to the

thither from his royal residence had no other object in view than to partake of the rites of religion and departed immediately after the service if perchance he took refreshment it was of the com∣mon fare of the Monks The attention of these Pastors was on spiritual matters only temporal affairs were deemed derogatory of their holy appointment and thence arose the high veneration which was paid by all ranks of people to the religious habit When any Ecclesiastic went from his monastery it was to preach the word of salvation and he was every where received with joy as a messenger of the Divinity on the road the passengers bowed the head to receive the sign of the cross and his benediction with pious reverence noting his precepts as documents of the most salutary purport the churches were crowded with a devout  audience and when a Monk was seen entering a village on his travels the inhabitants flocked about him entreating for his admonitions and prayers On their visitations riches and

favour of  Wilfred  EPISCOPUS VI  Wilfred was the preceptor of King  Alfred  Many anecdotes of Wilfrid take place in the account given of Hexham and its Prelates  he was a Northumbrian by birth and received his education at Lindisfarn being recommended by Queen  Eanfleda  to a Nobleman called  Cudda  who retired to this mo∣nastery he attended him thither as his companion and continued there from the th to the th year of his age During this Prelate's epis∣copacy there happened great revolutions and changes in the See of  Lin∣disfarn  the death of King  Oswy  was only a part of the calamities which fell upon  Northumberland  in his time  Egfrid  not only obtained the throne of the deceased Sovereign but by his powerful interest and ef∣forts deposed  Alfred  assuming the second scepter and uniting the whole in one sovereignty  Wilfred  was a proud aspiring man and debased the pall of the Prelate with ambition He became obnoxious to Theo∣dore who determined to humble him and in a short time got his de∣position effected Theodore had great interest with  Egfrid  which he used on this occasion to gratify his malice and resentment and under that ordinary craft of Ecclesiastics a specious pretence for the advance∣ment of religion and the honour of the church he obtained the royal mandate to divide  the kingdom of Northumberland  into two dioceses on a presumption that one Bishop had too much power and authority This ancient diocese then underwent a severance and the two parts  were distinguished by the names of  York  and  Lindisfarn  that of  York  comprehending the district of  Deira  and Lindisfarn that of  Bernicia  The adopted supremacy of Rome gave opportunity for appeal and  Wilfred  burning with resentment and disappointed ambition fled thi∣ther where a chapter being readily obtained he returned with the Pope's resolution in form for his restoration Big with the supreme mandate he obtruded himself abruptly on the royal presence but to his great mortification found the King exasperated at his insolence and impudent appeal not being the vassal of the See of Rome he pro∣fessed his contempt of its commands reproached  Wilfred  for having procured his credentials by bribery and as a presumptuous offender against the royal dignity he cast him into prison His lamentable si∣tuation excited the intercession of the devout  Ebba  St Ebba  daughter of  Edilfrid  King of  Northumberland  was Prioress of  Coldingham  in Scotland She with others cut off their noses that their beauty might be no bait to the lust∣ful  Danes  aunt to the King who obtained his liberty with an injunction that he never afterwards should enter the kingdom of  Northumberland  After his release  Wilfred  became a member of the monastery of  Glastonbury  under the then Abbot  Berthwald  of the royal house of Mercians but  Egfrid  's wrath and resentment was not subsided he continued his persecution of him even in his retreat and obtained his expulsion from that house He then fled to the court of  Adelwack  King of  Sussex  whose subjects were just receiving the light of conversion and that King gave him a Bishopric called  Selsey  Upon  Egfrid  's demise the crown of  Northumberland  de∣volved upon  Alfred  and  Theodore  declining in health and strength as he approached the grave in the steps of old age grew anxious to acquit or relieve his conscience of the severities he had exercised against  Wilfred  sought to gain his friendship and by his interest with the Crown and earnest solicitations obtained his restoration to the See of  York Wilfred  had no sooner reassumed his ecclesiastical dignity than his ungovern∣able ambition and arrogance blazed out anew the See of  York  at his first assumption of the episcopal dignity held in unity the kingdom of  Northumberland  at his restoration it was dismembered by a triple seve∣rance by the disunition of  Lindisfarn  and the new constitution of  Hex∣ham Wilfred  made injudicious pretensions and claims to effect a re∣union which so exasperated the King and was a thing so inconsistent with the politics of the times that he was again expelled and obliged to fly the realm He now sought refuge in the court of  Mercia  where  he won upon the ear of  Etheldred  and gained from him the Bishopric of  Leicester  Adversity is said to be the school of wisdom but it proved not so with  Wilfred  for in this new institution he conducted himself with that insolence and impropriety that he soon incurred the displea∣sure of the Mercian King and the Archbishop of Canterbury who brought him to trial before a synod and deposed him He was now years of age and yet his powers were so little debilitated and his passions remained so warm that he again journeyed to Rome and in spite of the character of a turbulent and contentious Prelate which he carried with him obtained a decree for his restoration He returned a second time with the powers of Rome in his favour and at a more favourable season to obtain the rewards of his labour The Archbishop found it convenient at that time to adhere to the mandate of supre∣macy the Mercian King had fallen into a state of enthusiasm and as∣sumed the habit of a Monk the King of  Northumberland  was under the attacks of a dangerous disease and feeling compunctions for the suf∣ferings  Wilfred  had undergone became reconciled to him Appearances were now much in the Prelate's favour and the propitious hour seemed to await him but Fate snatched off  Alfred  before a restoration was ef∣fected He obtained a council to be held upon the banks of the river  Nidd  under the mandate of King  Osred Alfred  's successor where with great difficulty he gained the Bishoprick of Hexham a small and mo∣dern member of his former See

of mean parents though some make him descended from the blood royal of Ireland but the first seems the most probable as he followed the occupation of a shepherd  Once upon a time when the saint was preaching in a certain village to a crowded audience the alarm was given that there was one of the cottages on fire this drew a number of people from the sermon to extinguish it which was just what satan proposed the more water they threw on it the more fiercely it seemed to burn and all efforts to put it out seemed inef∣fectual The saint missing so many of his auditors enquired the cause when leaving off his preaching and repairing to the scene of action he perceived it was all illusion and ordered a few drops of holy water to be sprinkled on it on which the devil sneaked off and the fire dis∣appeared  Grose  The same author repeats some other Iudicrious tales of the like nature  whilst he tended his flocks on the mountains first warmed his mind with that religious fervour which prompted him to a monastic life He was received into the fraternity of Mailross at an early age possessing a graceful person  He had such grace and skill in expression such persuasive zeal and such an angelic face and countenance that no one presumed to lock up the secrets of his heart from him  Bede's Eccl Hist  Extracts from the Legend of St Cuthbert or the Histories of his Churches at Lindisfarne Cunecascestre Dunholm by Robert Hegg A Manuscript in the Bishop's Library at Durham  "At which tyme I finde that  St Cuthbert  was a shepheard and that in the dead of the night he saw the soule of the said Bishop carryed up with great melody by a quire of angells into heaven which heavenly vision soe seaz'd upon his affection that resolving upon an holyer course of life he thought he could betake himself to noe better place then to the abby of  Mail∣rose  built by  Aidanus  upon the banks of  Tweed  but the devill to crosse his good intent meetes him in his journey and after a good cudgeling was glad to leave him for proof whereof in the same place to this day if you will borrowe an optickglass from superstition you may see the printe of his cloven foote Neither did his valour but also his humulitie appeare when overtaken by night and hunger he was forc'd to succour himselfe under an old cottage where he found noe other guest for entertainment then an horse which turning up the hay disco∣vered a loafe of bread at which the Saint right glad said grace and giving the horse one halfe satisfied himselfe with the other and the next day came to  Mailrose  where he had no sooner entred but  Boysilus  Prior of the abby by a propheticall phisiognomy as if he had read in his face his sanctite solemnly receives him in his armes and presents him to  Eata  the Ab∣bat who committed him to  Boysilus  for his tutor who taught him  St John's  gospell in that booke which in honour of the schollar was kept in the abby at Durham in Prior  Turgots  tyme on which after soe many centuries of yeares noe moth durst ever presume to feede  "In this abby after he had spent in the perfection of a monasticall life yeares he was prefer'd by  Eata  the Bishop to the Priorie of  Lindisfarne  In this  Holy Island  so christned in after ages for  St Cuthbert's  sanctitie stood that renouned monastery founded by  K Oswald  and was the mother church and nurcery of religion among the  Bernicians  under  Aidanus  from whom the episcopall race of the Prelates of the church of  Durham  reckon their succession  "In this island  fourteen  Bishops successively ascended the episcopall seate among whom as a glorious starre of the first magnitude  St Cuthbert  shyned in the firmament of this church where after twelve yeares he had borne the dignity of the Priorship he became a votary to an anachoreticall life and choosed the island  Farne  seated in the maine ocean for the place of his hermytage This island as voyd of trees water and graine as full of devills became the stage whereon  St Cuthbert  acted all his miracles for at his arrival the spirits that frequented this isle were put to slight the rocks powred out their water and as if there had beene a return of the golden age the earth brought forth corne without tillage with many more wonders if they might bee reported upon the creditt of a legend but these are enough to shewe what ad∣vantage  the Monkes took of the blind devotion of that age whose study and whole practise was to devise and relate miracles of their Saints which as superstition is alwaies credulous were as easily beleeved Thus to gaine from the  Pagans  a reverend opinion of christianity they thought it but a pious fraud to cosen the people with volumes of wonders who whiles they defended trueth by forgeries their impostures discover'd to wiser ages have rather made reli∣gion suspected then any way advanced it but if I should proceed in this discourse I should leave  St Cuthbert  too solitarie in his cell at  Farne  where for want of other auditors I finde him in the history preaching to birds that eate his corne who soe confuted them out of the text with  aliena non concupisces  that they never after touch'd his harvest In like manner he reclaymed two crowes from their wonted stealing and rapine that pull'd thatch of his ancho∣rage for to build their nests and made them so penitent that they lay prostrate at his feete for absolution  "In this isle he voluntarilye suffer'd nine yeares imprisonment from the society of men soe wholly devoted to heaven that he remembred not he was upon earth and for a whole yeare forgott to put off his shoes but he could not live soe obscurely in his cell as his same was re∣splendent abroad and in a synod at  Alne upon Twysord  he was in his absence chosen Bishop This dignity was prophesied to him long before whiles he was a child by an infant of three yeares old who gravely reproved him  Fye Saint Cuthbert what a Presbyter and a Bishop and playing among boyes  as if at that tyme he had seene him in his myter and crosier staffe but  St Cuthbert  had so wedded his affection to a solitary life that neither letters nor embassadors from the synod could perswade or command him to take upon him the government of the church till King  Egfrid  himselfe attended with both the Lords temporall and spirituall sayled to his hermytage and with the same company might have besieged and taken a city whiles they were conquering his resolution  "The King to enlarge his diocesse gave him a great part of the city of  Yorke  and the village of  Creca  with three miles compasse about it as also the cittie of  Carliel  with the circuit of fif∣teen miles about it but for all this  St Cuthberts  mind was still on his anchorage whither shortly he betooke himselfe againe and in contempt of honour edded his life in his cell But it shall be no part of his funerall prayses thus to unman himselfe to contemplate himselfe into a God or  Silvanus  for what was this else then to excommunicate himselfe from the common∣weale and to finne against the definition of a man to whom societie is as naturall as to bee a creature and surely religion cannot bee the motive of such an unnaturall act but rather in all such anchorites a melancholy distemper is usually mistaken for devotion  "His last will and testament was to his Monkes to bury him at the east side of his oratory in a coffin that venerable  Cudda  the Abbat gave him which they should finde hid in the ground at the north side of his cell and to putt his corps in the shirt that  Verca  Abbatesse of  Tinmouth  had sent him for a token which for the reverence of that holy woman he had never worn in his life time and lastly if the  Pagans  should invade them and force them to flye that they should carry with them his bones All these desires were performed onely at the weeping re∣quest of the Monkes he permitted that his body should bee transported to  Lindisfarne  where in  St Peters  church at the right side of the high altar he was solemnly enshrined anno domini  "But to returne to  Saint Cuthbert  who had now an eleven yeares lyen in his sepulchre when the Monkes thought to place his bones by this time drye and disrobed of flesh among their other reliques for kisses and adoration but behold a wonder They looke for a skeleton but found an entire body with joints flexible and flesh so succulent that there onely wanted heate to make his body live without a soule nay his very funerall weedes were so fresh as if putrefaction had not dared to pluck him by the coate This was rather to pay his debt to hea∣ven then to nature who after he had restored his soule to God should keepe back the pay∣ment  of his body from corruption In other men it is true that sleepe is the image of death but here the grave suffer'd a cheat and death was the image of sleepe  "This miracle  St Beda  reports who was an eleven yeares old at  St Cuthberts  death in re∣lating whereof he made no lye but perhaps told one The history of whose life and death he writ from the information of the Monkes of  Lindisfarne  who had defloured all the miracles of Saints in holy writt and bestowed them upon their  St Cuthbert  who like man in paradise had the beasts to doe him homage and the sea monsters to aske him blessing Like  Abraham  he entertayned three angells at the monasterie of  Rippon  A raven brought  Elias  flesh and an eagle brought  St Cuthbert  fish As he sayl'd with his mother from  Ireland  his native soyl into  Scotland  he lett the book of Psalmes fall into the sea which forthwith was swallowed up of a sea calfe and by the same fish delivered to them at their landing Take here the psalter for a man and the sea calfe for a whale and you have the history of  Ionas  with many such histories of wonder with which the Monkes delighted the superstition of the times  "After this illustrious miracle of  St Cuthbert's  incorruption  Lindisfarne  rais'd itselfe to that height of renowne that  Ceolwolphus  the King to whom  Bede  dedicates his English Historie resigned an earthly crowne to gaine a celestiall one and tooke upon him the habitt of a Monke in  Lindisfarne  a welcome man you may be sure to that monastery for whose sake it was graunted the Monkes there to drinke wine or ale who before were onely to drinke milke or water though they that dranke after  Saint Cuthbert  in his cupp found sometimes water turn'd into wyne without a miracle  "Many kingly treasures did this devout Prince bestowe upon that monastery with such large possessions as he seem'd rather to resigne his kingdome to the church than to his successour and became a Monke to make  St Cuthbert  a King for he endowed that monastery with all the land betweene the rivers of  Tees  and  Weer  and many townes and lordships as  Warkworth Castle Billingham Gedworth  where  Ceolwolphus  built the church and diverse other villages as  Woodcestre Hutingham Bresgen Edulingham  names that for ought I know have outlived their townes or townes that have chang'd their names  "After the manifestation of this miracle of bodily immortality after death  Eadfrid  then Bi∣shop caused him to be lay'd in a new sepulchre and to be advanced for state and reverence above the pavement in the sanctuary for it was not fitt that he should have his grave among the dead whose body lived by sanctity when his soule was gone  "Now they began to worship the very ground  St Cuthbert  had troad upon whose sanctity was such that he made every place he came in a church and  Eadfrid  in honour of  St Cuth∣berts  presence there built up his hermitage where as if a genius of sanctity had frequented that place  Ethelwald  a Monke of  Rippon  lived an Hermite twelve yeares  "Thus for a long tyme flourished the Monkes of that church in great repute and prosperity till the  Danes  disturbed their peace who now began to make incursions upon the frontiers of this land for many yeares continueing their piracies till they had made a final conquest which at length yeilded to the  Norman  sword Those were the tymes when so many monasteries which the devotion of former ages had erected had their funerals then perished that famous Emporium of  Hartlepoole  where the religious  Hieu  built a nunnery of which I may speake as  Hildebert  of  Rome  Quam magna fueras integra fracta doces  whose ruines shew how great shee was in her glory but now remayns to passengers both a mo∣nument of devotion and hostility then were demolished the two monasteries of  St Peter  and  St Paul  at  Weremouth  and  Jarrow  built by the reverend Abbats  Celfrid  and  Benedict  "The furie of the  Danes  still encreasing continued by the sea costes to  Tinmouth  so that it was now tyme for the Monkes of  Lindisfarne  to look about them for they well understood by  the lamentable usage of their neighbouring abbyes that the  Danes  would not like the devill bee affrighted with holy water and saw by the bad successe of other monasteries that it was not safe trusting to the protection of a Saint and so concluding upon flight putting all their reliques into  St Cuthberts  coffin they left the  Pagans  the spoyle of an empty church anno Domini  "It was  Eardulphus  his fortune to bee Bishop in these troublesome tymes who with his whole Cleargy and families of People followed this sacred bier which besides seaven Monkes as deputed Esquires of his body none durst presume to touch These miseries had beene enough to have unfainted  St Cuthbert  when pursued both by forreine foes and overtaken with an homebred enemy famyne he could afford them no releife They were now come to the first sea and might complaine as the old  Brittanes  did to  Actius  the Consull  Repellunt nos Barbari ad mare repellit mare ad Barbaros inter haec duo oriuntur genero functum aut jugulamur aut mergimur  But because the disrespective sea would not divide itselfe at the approach of  St Cuthbert  the Bishop with some fewe of his Monkes determin'd privily to sayle over into  Ire∣land  with his corps that there he might finde rest for his toumbe where he first had his birth But they had not farre sail'd from the shore but the winds and the sea were both up in armes against their shippe which both  Aeolus  and  Neptune  might have reverenced for her sacred car∣ryage of a Bishop and his Clergy but the sea roared soe loud that noe prayers for  St Cuthbert  could bee heard but threaten'd them so near with shipwracke as they had not that confidence in their Saint as to encourage the marriners as Caesar did  Ne metues Cuthbertum vehis  who now himself wanted some other Saint to invocate for helpe and was in daunger to bee drowned after he was dead Where had then beene the  church of Durham  and the devotion of Kings to his sepulchur Where had then beene the  tutelarie Deity  against the  Scotts  and the lande of the church called  St Cuthberts patrimony  How then should his  halywarkefolk  be freed from tribute and service in warre and the Monkes of Durham fed soe many yeares with ease and fatt revenues if now their Saint had beene entombed in the sea and erected his episcopal seate among the fishes This sacrilegious storme strucke this shippe with such a palsie that it shak't out the texts of the Evangelists into the sea This book  Eadfrid  Bishop of  Lindisfarne  had writ out with his own hand and  Belfrid  the Anchorite had curiously paynted and guilded it in which art the Monkes were admirably expert not that I taxe in them this quality but onely it argued the Monkes were at great leasure Thus whether the sea as envying the land such a precious jewell as  St Cuthbert  or he himself to shew his dislike for  Ireland  had raised this storme it was not long 'till in a calme they were carryed to the shore from whence they sett forth but great sorrow you must imagine was for the drowned booke 'till one  Hundredus  one of the seven that carryed the coffyn was bid in a night vision by  St Cuthbert  to goe seeke it on the shoare at  Whitterne  where he found it in its former beautie and splendour which was kept in  Prior Turgots  tyme in Durham in memory of the miracle when the water seem'd to run out of herselfe to doe homage to  St Cuthbert  and would rather loose her nature then wett his book If this were true then I am sure that  St Cuthberts  bookes had twice bet∣ter fortune in the sea then they have now in his library at Durham which was once a little vatican of choyce manuscripts but now rather a  than a library rather a sepulcher f  r bookes than a place to conserve them but this is the disease of most church libraryes since the inventing of printing by which men finding a more compendious way and a cheaper passage to superficial learning have bequeathed old manuscripts to the mothes and jackdawes the onely students at this day in such libraries  "But to returne to the forenamed Monkes who had another oracle by night from  St Cuth∣bert  to repair to a certaine tree whereon he should finde a bridle at the sight whereof a dunne horse should proffer his service for ease of the Monkes to drawe  St Cuthberts  body lay'd upon a wagon but this was not to steale an horse because it was an horse of  St Cuthberts  providing the conduct whereof as if he understood more of  St Cuthberts  minde than the rest they followed whither soever he drew him and at length by the providence of the horse they came to the monastery of  Creca  where for foure moneths they were kindly entertayned by the Abbat and his Covent and had leasure to tell storyes of their travailes  "From this abby in a revelation by night  St Cuthbert  sent  Aeadred  Abbat of  Luell  upon an embassage to the campe of the  Danes  that they should crowne  Guthredus  King whom they had sold to a widdow a thing in those days not practiced by the Pope to dispose of kingdomes But what authority he had to nominate a King or what reason they had to believe a dreame must be rank'd amongst  St Cuthberts  miracles for  Guthred  thus to bee made a King what was it else then to become  St Cuthberts  subject and to oblige his royalty to those Monkes that as boldly encroacht upon soe fayre an advantage For first they require the restauration of their episcopal seat in  Cuncacestre  where  Eardulphus  first ascended the pontifical chayre And it was but another dreame for the foresayd Abbot to goe to the King from  St Cuthbert  and bid him give all the lands betwixt  Weer  and  Tyne  for ever to his church This modest request must bee graunted or else the Monkes would be ready to upbrayd him with ingratitude Ah poor Prince to bee thus rob'd of his kingdome and to receive a diademe to set it upon  St Cuth∣berts  head Thus was the religious King cheated of his soveraignty by those Monkes that had now got the art of anslaving the devotion of Princes to their private ends for at this tyme also the great  Alfred  swore fealty to  St Cuthbert  and his Clergy by whose help they perswaded him that he had got the victory over the  Pagans  This made them bold also to ask the privi∣ledge of a sanctuary for their church to reskue offenders dayes at  St Cuthberts  sepulchre that neither Justice should curbe the freedome of sinning either against heaven or the state for noe other use was commonly made of asylums than that men might offend more securely and disloyally appeal from the King and the Lawes to the protection of a Saint Neither was this enough 'till King  Alfred  must by his royal charter free the inhabitants of  St Cuthberts  lande from tribute to the King which he sealed with fearful anathem's to his successors that should infringe the said liberties What else was this than for a King to bee a Traitour to his own Majesty and deprive himself of that service which even by the law of nature is due from a Subject to his Prince  "Now in what reverend esteem this Saint was to King  Alfred  I gather from the consecra∣tion of the chappel to  St Cuthbert  in  University Colledge  in  Oxford  where he is said to bee the first founder in an antient window whereof  King Alfred  and  St Cuthbert  are painted together the King bespeaking the Saint in a pentameter  Hic in honore tui Collegium statui  and  St Cuthbert  thus replying in an hexameter  Quod statuisti in eo pervertentes maledico  and by such curses the Monks maintayn'd their lands in a better tenure than under the Kings broad seale The like malediction you may read in a distick in  Trinity Colledge  in  Oxford  en∣graven in wooden letters over the screene  Terras Cuthberti qui non spoliare verentur  Esse queant certi quod morte mala morientur  which colledge was founded by  Thomas Hatfield  Bishop of Durham anno Domini  "Thus after  Eardulphus  the last Bishop of  Lindisfarne  and the first of  Chester  had shared with  St Cuthbert  both in his prosperity and adversity and had seene this new church sprung up like a phoenix out of the ashes of the former he ended his life in a full age and was so∣lemnely enterred anno Domini in which yeare also died the victorious  Alfred  who on his death bedd bequeathed his love of  St Cuthbert  as a precious legacy to his sonne  Edward  chargeing him to be as well heire to his devotion to that Saint as to his kingdomes King  Edward  also as if it had beene  ex traduce  to those Princes to honour  St Cuthbert  left

such natural advantages it is not to be wondered that his doctrines were persuasive or rather irre∣sistible  For twelve years he governed the priory of  Lindisfarn  where he lived an exemplary life for piety and selfdenial and never ceased  his exhortations to religion and virtue frequently taking journies into the desert and mountainous parts of the country to instruct and con∣vert  the most barbarous of the inhabitants At length conceiving that the luxury or ease of a monastic life afforded too selfish enjoyments to  allow his spirit due attendance on contemplations and the service of the Deity he retired from  Lindisfarn  and commenced the life of an  Anchorite in the largest of the  Farne Islands  laying opposite to  Bam∣brough  and within sight of  Lindisfarn  being distant from thence about two leagues  Anno incarnationis Dominicae sexcentesimo septuagesimo sexto qui est annus imperii Regis Ecgfridi sextus cum vir Domini Cuthbertus in Lindisfarnensis monasterii prioratu

small oratory and surrounded it with a wall which cut off the view of every object but heaven  Est locus insignis flu super ostia Tini  Ex imio jam tunc monachorum examine pollens  Cuthbertus fit

to a life of mortification and severity than this island the ancient description of it is horrible seated near a stormy coast surrounded by rocks over which the sea breaks incessantly with great tumult destitute of fresh water with∣out tree for shelter or fruitbearing shrub or where withal to sustain human life and worse than all said to be possessed by devils  Bede says the cell of St Cuthbert was surrounded with a  trench  perhaps the meaning is by a fence of earth  But the happy and miraculous change which took place on  Cuthbert  's taking up his solitary residence there is too singular to escape observation  Verum illo quoque virum Dei comitante miraculorum gloria de rupe saxosa precibus fontem elicuit de tellure durissima segetem produxit hoste antiquo cum satellitum turba fugato locum ipsum habitabilem fecit Postquam enim inhabitator sancti Spiritus suam ibidem habita∣tionem instituit in tantum Spiritus nequam deinceps ipsam insulam exhorruit ut qui eam Christo famulaturus ingreditur nullas ex phantasiis Daemonum inquietudines sustinere dicatur  Sym Dunelm  the flinty rock bubbled with fountains of fresh water the once barren soil with prolific abundance brought forth grain  Bede's account of this growing corn like the miracles of those days is reconciled by the simple rules of nature  He desired to have wheat brought him and tools to till the ground and when he had prepared the land with infinite labour and sown it in due season in the summer there appeared neither blade or ear when he was again visited by his brethren he required of them barley for seed and having sowed it in the same field out of all sowing sea∣son and without hope of fruit there grew up an abundant crop c  trees and shrubs  bearing fruit decked the smiling shores the troubled waters clapped their hands for joy the plains assumed a mantle of green embroidered with flowers the evil spirits were bound in eternal darkness and an∣gels of light communed with the Anchorite Such are the records of the religious of those ages  In this dreary solitude St Cuthbert remained several years during which time he had a variety of combats with the devil the print of whose feet is it is said to be seen in many places If any persons out of devotion came to visit him he retired to his cell and discoursed with them only through his window Once indeed to oblige a Lady the Abbess of Colding∣ham he paid her a visit at the Isle of Coquet where going down to the sea shore as was his custom every night two sea monsters presented themselves kneeling before him as if to demand his benediction which having received they returned to the deep  Grose  Credis huic quod dicat  This life of severity excited the reverence and admiration of those ages of ignorance Whether enthusiasm alone could determine the hu∣man mind to such undertakings or there was a degree of pride mixed in the influenza I cannnot determine The vices of those times I pre∣sume were not attended with such degrees of despair as are unknown to us the inducements must have been more complicated than the out∣ward countenance of piety expressed How different the manners of the religious of the same church in modern times  An ambitious or hypocritical religious who makes a profession of humility whilst he is puffed up with pride a man meanly clad and who only seeks after riches a pretender to devotion who gives himself out as a servant of God while he is no more than a slave to his passions is a monster both in church and state    Every intriguing Monk or Friar who thrusts himself into families for the purpose of prying into secrets regulating marriages or wills is as despicable as he is dangerous  These are the liberal sentiments of the immortal Ganganelli Pope Cle∣ment XIV whose works have placed the Romish church in a more amiable point of view than it has appeared in several past ages  I have frequently ruminated on man's several affections and this se∣verity of  St Cuthbert  's restores to my memory some distant ideas I have always considered  Friendship  as comprehending the most excellent feelings of the human heart how a social and generousminded man could live without the enjoyment of friendship and totally withdraw himself from all attachments with the world is to me truly a severity little to be comprehended I presume the Saint must have held the  very argument  Mr Hume  Hume's Eassays Nat Hist of Religion vol p  adopts to account for the austerities of su∣perstitious men  Nor is it satisfactory to say that the practice of morality is more difficult than that of superstition and is therefore rejected For not to mention the excessive pennances of the  Bach∣man  's and  Talaponis  it is certain that the  Rhamadan  of the  Turks  during which the poor wretches for many days often in the hottest months of the year and in some of the hottest climates in the world remain without eating or drinking from the rising to the setting sun this  Rhamadan  I say must be more severe than the practice of any moral duty even to the most vicious and depraved of mankind The four Lents of the  Muscovites  and the austeries of some  Roman Catho∣licks  appear more disagreeable than  meekness  and  benevolence  Perhaps the following account may be received as a true solution of the difficulty The duties which a man performs as a friend or parent seem meerly owing to his benefactor or children nor can he be wanting to these duties without breaking through all the ties of nature and morality A strong inclination may prompt him to the performance a sentiment of order and moral obligation joins its force to these natural ties and the whole man is truly virtuous is drawn to his duty without any effort or endeavour Even with re∣gard to the virtues which are more austere and more founded on reflection such as public spirit filial duty temperance or integrity the moral obligation in our apprehension remove all pretension to religious merit and the virtuous conduct is deemed no more than what we owe to society and to ourselves In all this a superstitious man finds nothing which he has properly performed for the sake of his Deity or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine fa∣vour and protection He considers not that the most genuine me∣thod of serving the Divinity is by promoting the happiness of his creatures He still looks out for some more immediate service of the Supreme Being in order to allay those terrors with which he is haunted And any practice recommended to him which either serves to no purpose in life or offers the strongest violence to his na∣tural inclinations that practice he will the more readily embrace on account of those very circumstances which should make him ab∣solutely reject it It seems the more purely religious because it pro∣ceeds  from no mixture of any other motive or consideration And if for its sake he sacrifices much of his ease and quiet his claim of merit appears still to rise upon him in proportion to the zeal and devotion which he discovers In restoring a loan or paying a debt his Divinity is in no wise beholden to him because these acts of justice are what he was bound to perform and what many would have performed were there no God in the universe But if he fast a a day or give himself a sound whipping this has a direct reference in his opinion to the service of God No other motive could engage him to such austerities By these distinguished marks of devotion he has now acquired the divine favour and may expect in recompence protection and safety in this world and eternal happiness in the next  But I will quit this review to return to the more interesting features of  Friendship  If we compare  Friendship  to the other affections of man we see  Love  has a powerful influence on the human heart but its bounds are con∣fined and its conclusions selfish it has but one object to possess its attachments are rigorous indeed but full of prejudice and its whole influence centers in an  Egoity  wherein generosity and honour lose much of their lustre  Gratitude  is an excellent operation of the soul our obligations are therein duly estimated it is a confession of our former indigence and selfimportance is refined by such humiliation it depends on the com∣parison which is drawn between our own wants and the bounty re∣ceived  Gratitude  is a branch of  moral honesty  a confession of  the debt of obligation  Yet  Friendship  is abundantly superior to  Love  and  Gratitude  it is an affection of the heart in which  Benevolence  presides it is accompanied by an openness of mind wherein  Generosity  and  Honour  are exemplary without selfishness or price or consideration of reward In  Friendship  the bosom is expanded and elated secrecy guile and concealment are expelled and probity truth and virtue reign in their place There is an energy in  Friendship  to which every faculty contributes it fires the soul with fervour and fills the heart with gladness You act there∣in from the same principles as would conduct your own nearest and most momentous affairs it is that  divine perfection  to which we are  peculiarly exhorted  Love your neighbour as yourself  With our friend all disguise is thrown off the political guise of politeness which masks sincerity is taken away the heart leaps with affection the eyes gaze with rapture approbation and esteem the countenance glows with expressions of delight the bosom is unlocked the treasures of the bo∣som are thrown abroad you fear no treachery you are open and con∣fident you communicate with the same joy you receive instruction and all is pleasure  Such were the feelings my youth experienced in the possession of a friend How often hath the young mind hung enraptured in the asso∣ciation of my friend The cordiality that then took place was as dear as life Riper manhood hath retained the whole though in a graver degree  I think I hear the Saint reply  the warmth of our sociability freezes up with declining youth our cordiality cools as age advances and our openness of heart decreases as the frauds of mankind and dis∣appointments of life advance upon experience we grow afraid of the hidden dangers our confidence hath often prompted and we gra∣dually treasure up in our memories the lessons of example and the inferences of experience which like the sepulchres of the dead only remind us how many friends are departed how many disasters are incident to life how little dependence there is on man and how vain is all human confidence in the things of this world  If such is the consequence of age if the delightful taste of  Friendship  passeth away I will cling to the departing footsteps I will grasp at the sacred verge from whence to fall is to depart from the first and the finest enjoyment of human life the only possession on earth which gives an idea of the communion of angels  To return to our Saint He was elected by the Synod

being Easter day in the year and in the th of the reign of King  Egfrid  The King was present at this ceremony with seven Bishops He was first made Bishop of  Hexham  and thence translated to  Lindisfarn  in the place of  Eata  who was removed to  Hexham  On this occasion  Egfrid  with the Metropolitan  Theodorus  in testimony of their love and reverence for this holy Prelate gave to the church of Lindisfarn all the land from the walls of the church of St Peter in York to the west gate of the city and from the same church to the city wall on the south also the village of  Craike  with territories there not less than three miles in cir∣cuit that the Bishops might have a house of rest as they should pass to  and from York  Dedit ei Rex Ecfridus in Civitate Eboraco a muro Ecclesiae S

consumed by fire The religious society of this house consisted of Monks and Nuns  This association of Monks and Nuns is said to be grounded on the words of our Saviour John xix  who occupied separate parts of the edifice but the severities of a devoted life and the strict rules professed in such societies were not sufficient to prevent a shameful re∣laxation of discipline and many gross abuses and enormities took place insomuch that the destruction of this stately edifice was regarded as a judgment for the crimes and pollutions of its inhabitants The mo∣nastery of  Lindisfarn  looked upon the event with religious horror and soon after  Cuthbert  was made Bishop he forbid the approach of women to the convent and even denied them access to the church where the Monks performed their devotions he caused a small chapel to be erected in a distant plain on the island for the reception of the female sex from its situation taking the name of Greenchurch From thenceforth the women were excluded the churches or cemeteries where St  Cuthbert  's body rested and some miraculous punishments are related which at∣tended infringements on this injunction In the cathedral church at Durham the pavement is distinguished by a cross of black marble be∣yond which women were not allowed to advance towards the choir  Cuthbert  enjoyed his change of life and dignities but a very short time for within two years finding his health declining and his mind being by habit tempered more for solitude and silence than the duties of this high office he resigned the See and returned to his cell in  Farne  where he survived only two months yielding his spirit to God on the th day of May in the d year of the creation of the See of  Lindisfarn  and years after he had assumed the monastic habit at  Mailross  He directed by his last will that his body should be buried at the east end of the oratory in a stone coffin given him by the holy  Tuda  and wrapped up in a sheet presented him as a token by  Virca  Abbess of Tynemouth which out of reverence to that holy woman he had never used and lastly if the island should be invaded by Pagans he ordered the Monks to fly from them and carry his bones away with them These directions were none of them performed his body was transported to Lindisfarn where in St Peter's church at the right side of the high altar he was solemnly laid in a tomb of stone but the Monks left behind them the coffin for which he expressed such regard which still continues to be shewn at Farne Island and it is highly probable they were not more mindful of the sheet  Grose  His body was brought from  Farne  to be interred at  Holy Island  where his remains were deposited with great funeral pomp first in the cemetery of the old church and afterwards on the right side of the high altar on the cathedral's being rebuilt and for his exemplary piety and virtue the church enrolled him in the table of Saints  In the Philosophical Transactions a curious painting of St Cuthbert is described found neer Ashelney in Somersetshire The portrait is enamelled on gold drawn sitting in an epis∣copal chair with the following inscription  AELFRED MEL HETT GEWYRLAN  Thus construed Alfredus me jussit fabricari  Mr Wallis speaking of this portrait has the following remarks  King Alfred preferred these characters to the Saxon and when he swayed the scepter brought them in use This curious memorial of St Cuthbert was found in the very place of that glorious Monarch's re∣treat and deliverance from the Danes fortified by him in the time of war and in time of peace converted into a monastery Dr Musgrave thinks this curious  Cimolium  an undeni∣able instance of the use of images coming from the heathens into the christian church  St Cuthbert's shrine had the privilege of sanctuary where fugitives were safe for days This respite allowed criminals a time for making restitution or under the feudal laws they would have suffered immediate pains and punishments it was the process by which the rigour of common law was moderated and when kept in due restraint was of great benefit to man∣kind but by an enormous extension which took place it produced infinite mischiefs to the community and to the state  On St Cuthbert's death  Wilfrid  Bishop of  Hexham  held the See of  Lindisfarn  for one year only he was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS IX  Eadbert  a learned man of exemplary life and piety and of a most humane and charitable disposition His custom was to remit all tithes to the poor He reerected the church of Lindisfarn and covered it  LINDISFARN

did not so closely follow his exemplary life as Bede conceived he should have done for the honour of religion whereupon he took upon him to dictate manners to the Prelate The letter wrote on this occa∣sion was said to be the means of  Egfridth  's attending more strictly to his studies and from that time he translated a great part of the Gospels into the Saxon language for the easier communication to the people Bede's maxims were I doubt not well adapted to the age and they still are not insignificant to the Prelates of more modern and learned times The subjects of this expostulation were chiefly the importance of a Bishop's duty and the greatness of the charge which he had as∣sumed he entreated him to recognize the divine commission as being the ordination of the great missionary of heaven that he should re∣buke the proud in the vanity of their high station and instruct them in the duties of humiliation that they should not erect churches for the sake of popular admiration and worldly honour but as works of piety only for the propagation of religion and virtue that he should visit his Clergy and reprove or lop off those branches which were contami∣nated  with the vices of the age and that his leisure hours should be appropriated to acts of devotion and study and not sacrificed to plea∣sures luxuries and indolent ease  Egfridth  was

conflagration was then possessed it is said by Nuns under an Abbess called  Ebba  of royal blood She dreading the barbarities these invaders exercised in their former descent on all ranks of religious in an assembly of her Nuns representing the hazard their chastity was in communicated a device which she presumed would preserve them from these violators Without hesitation they vowed that her rules should be strictly observed Forthwith she drew out a razor and as an example with the greatest fortitude cut off her nose and upper lip she was followed by the whole sisterhood When the  Danes  entered the convent in the morning they were shocked with the horrid spectacle and disappointed in their lusts set fire to the edifice wherein the Abbess with all her whole convent  were consumed  There is the greatest improbability in this relation touching the massacre of Ebba and her Nuns In the time of Ebba who was of royal race the society consisted of Monks and Nuns and she was dead before St Cuthbert was consecrated Bishop of Lindisfarn and made the regu∣lation noted in regard to the female sexThe reader will correct the note at p If the name of the Abbess of Coldingham at the time of this descent of the Danes was Ebba it could not be Ebba daughter of Edilfrid King of Northumberland  This is the story of Matthew of Westminster but other authors  Chron Sax Sym Dunelm c  whose relations are attended with greater probability fix the place of this Danish descent at the mouth of the Humber from whence the invaders marched to  York Osbert  at their approach led forth a powerful army and engaged them near the city where he fell amongst the slain and his troops were totally routed  Aella  who had held a conflict of five years for the kingdom of  Northumberland  with  Osbert  under the support of  Bruern  and his allies is said upon the Da∣nish invasion to have come to a compromise with  Osbert  and joined with him against the common enemy and that in the battle he also fell with  Osbert  This account gains greater credit than that of  Bruern  's application to the  Danes  and it seems most probable the object of this invasion was no other than rapine and plunder The  Danes  after this victory having laid waste the country between  York  and the  Tyne  made  Egbert  King of  Northumberland  north of Tyne to hold his Crown as their dependent Being afterwards employed in expeditions against the southern parts of this island the Northumbrians dethroned this vassal King and gave the Crown to  Ricsig  Not long after this the Danish King embarking his troops in some of the southern counties sailed for the mouth of Tyne and landed at the town of  Tynemouth  where he wintered it being too late in the year to attempt any thing against the Northumbrians On the opening of the spring they began their ravages on this unfortunate country and marked their progress with unequalled barbarities  Lindisfarn  was the object of their peculiar

Lindisfarn  happened in the d year of  Eardulf  's episcopacy years after the foundation of the See by  Oswald  and  Aidan  and years after the death of  St Cuthbert  These Ecclesiastics flying from the fury of the invaders wandered from one hidingplace to another with their hallowed burthens of which even the stone crucifix of  Ethel∣wold  made a part for seven continued years at length resting at  Chesterlestreet  in the county of Durham  The legendary tales of St Cuthbert's miracles during his life time must give place to those after his death  King  Alfred  for the first six years was greatly distressed by the Danish invasions he was at last reduced to the necessity of seeking his safety for a considerable time in an obscure and inac∣cessible retreat among the Marshes of Somersetshire Having there collected a few chosen troops he issued out unexpectedly on the enemy and obtained a glorious victory  Guthurn  one of the Danish Chieftains who was taken prisoner was persuaded by  Alfred  to embrace the christian religion and his example influenced his adherents After which he was raised by  Al∣fred  to the throne of the  East Angles  as a dependent Prince under the Saxon Monarchy Whilst  Alfred  endured great distress in his retreat he was comforted by a vision of this Saint who promised him the success he afterwards experienced from hence  Alfred  was inspired with great veneration for him The body of Danes which had settled in  Northumberland  having lost their Chieftain  Haldan  remained some time without a leader  Eadred  the Abbot of  Lindisfarn  who together with his Bishop was still flying from one retreat to another with their sacred charge assured the Bishop and the whole army of Danes and English that the Saint had ap∣peared to him in a vision and expressed his command to them to redeem from slavery  Guthred  the son of  Hardiknut  a youth sold by the  Danes  to a widow at  Whittingham  and make him their King The injunction was received with enthusiastic reverence and piously obeyed  Guthred  was crowned at  York  and ruled over the southern departments of the  Northumbrian kingdom  Soon after his accession  Guthred  in gratitude to the Saint gave all the county be∣tween  Tyne  and  Tees  to the Bishopric then settled at  Chester  And King  Alfred  from a like principle confirmed the donation  With the sacred remains of the Saint the  Bishopric  was removed from this island to  Chester  and whilst settled there this Bishop A D annexed thereto the vacant Bishopric of  Hexham  which had been with∣out

desertion of  Lindisfarn  the monastery was destroyed and the church dismantled but afterwards there was a cell of Bene∣dictine Monks established here who were subordinate to the Priory of Durham The

where remaining till the ravagers again quitted the country and presuming it a proper season for their return to  Chester  on their way by a miraculous power they were stayed at  Wardelaw  a hill near the sea coast within about eight miles of Durham where in a vision  Eadmerus  one of their pious attendants had a revelation that at  Dunhelmus  the sacred relics should rest for ever a situation fortified by nature being a lofty eminence surrounded by the river Wear overgrown with a thick entangled grove in the  center of which was an open though concealed plain of cultivated land which

forget we had yet to visit many scenes in this county as worthy the observation of the Antiquarian and Traveller as those present to us and we calculated our departure so ill that the tide had begun to return before we entered upon the sands We thought ourselves secure indeed against all dangers by having a Farmer from the neighbouring shore for our guide who had brought over butter that morning for the inhabitants The tide approached in a singular manner not flowing forward in waves but the water increased imperceptably by oozing through the sands At first the passage seemed a tract of wet sand but presently it became a shining plain of level water unruffled by any influx reflecting in the most beautiful manner the variegated landskips of the adjoining shores Our guide rode upon one of those methodical beasts which keeps up an invariable motion with a kind of mechanical exactness in spite of every approaching emergency We expressed our anxiety at the increasing waters yet not daring to leave our guide on account of the intercepting gullies and the apprehension of quicksands of the situation and nature of which we were totally ignorant He was unaltered except in his dialogue which now was filled with the circumstances of a late Traveller's death who perished in the passage wandering on the sands till he could not extricate himself from the surrounding floods This was no pleasing narrative to us who were now dashing through the increasing waters up to our horses girths our guide's constancy of countenance and un∣moved mind affording us no very agreeable contemplation I wish to prevent strangers engaging in so disagreeable a project tho' ours was attended with no other circumstances than anxiety and impatiency of mind yet had we attempted to make this passage without a guide it is impossible to determine what would have been our lot  At some little distance we viewed  HAGGERSTON  covered with a fine grove Here is an old tower memorable for being the place where King Henry II A D received the homage of  Thomas Earl of Lancaster  This is an ancient mansion of the family of  Haggerstons  whose possession we find recorded in the escheats of King Edward I the present proprietor Sir Carnaby Haggerston  John Haggerston King Henry III  Sir Thomas created a Baronet King Charles I was Colonel in the famous Northumberland regiment  Sir Thomas Governor of Berwick  Sir Carnaby  Sir Thomas  Sir Carnaby  Wallis  The church of  KYLOE  graces the distant prospect  In the former part of the reign of King Henry VIII the buckles barrs and studs of a Knight's belt and a pommel and cross for a sword and buckles and studs for spurs all of gold were found between two stones here They came into the possession of Dr Ruthal Bishop of Durham  Leland's Itin vol  Kyloe the residence of  Eustace de Kiley  in the reign of King Edward I  FENWICK and BEAL  were also in view the latter of which places it is said was for some time honoured by the residence of and takes its name from the fa∣mous Irish female Saint  Begogh  This is the patroness of Kirby Begegh and Beal in YorkshireLife of Grindad  We approached  BELFORD  a small town not seated in the most fertile spot in  Northumberland  the country being open and unsheltered The mansion of  Abraham Dixon  Esq  a modern structure of Pane's architecture surrounded with pleasure grounds and young plantations greatly ornament the scene but the situation is far from eligible there being none of that rural variety that elegant simplicity or its reverse those wildnesses in nature which  constitute a pleasing country prospect The hills rise tamely the in∣closures are large and ill wooded the hamlets are very distantly scat∣tered and nothing appears singular or attracting upon the whole view but the  Castle of Bambrough  and the sea which forms the horizon  Bel∣ford  was the property of a family of Hepburns in the reign of King Henry V  We passed from  Belford  to  BAMBROUGH  by  Budle  once the possession of the family of  Bowes  of  Streatlam  Near  Budle  at a place called  Spindleston  The poem of the Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heughs inserted in the following notes seems to be of an historic nature but wrapped up in such dark allegory the humour of those times as to render it unintelligible in this age The fortifications are Danish and it is pro∣bable that the ballad relates to the conflicts of that people with the garrison of Bambrough  is a Danish camp circular in form and fortified with a triple ditch and vallum Two mounts are seen from it which appear to be outposts and not Tumuli as some writers have conjectured To the westward is another intrenchment which forms a crescent and seems not to be the work of the same people who had constructed the former fortifications It is defended by a triple ditch and vallum the interior vallum composed of uncemented stones as was the British custom This commands a lookout to sea and has in view the castles of  Bambrough  and  Holy Island  Opposite to this for∣tification is a square camp apparently Roman called  Ulchester  The manor of  Budle  was formerly a member of the Barony of  Wooler  and was the possession of  Sir Robert de Ulchester  as appears by the escheats of King Edward I It was forfeited on the attainder of its late owner  Lord Derwentwater  and now makes a part of the appropriations of Greenwich Hospital  Within a mile lies  EDERSTON  the seat of the late John William Bacon Forster  Esq  which descended to him on the extinction of the right line of the family of  Forsters  who possessed it

the traveller an idea of the state of pa∣laces and strongholds in the remotest aera of our  Saxon ancestors  in Bri∣tain The scite of this fortress is on the crown of a high rock trian∣gular in figure one of the points projecting into the sea Many of the buildings stand on the very brink of the rocks to the land side the aspect towards the sea is very lofty being near perpendicular feet above the level of low water mark Part of the most ancient fortifica∣tions on the land side are broken and defaced by the falling of the cliffs on which they were erected the same consisting of a soft red stone which perishes much by the weather On this side a circular tower remains of very antique construction its base projecting in se∣veral tiers Many of the other buildings appear to be the work of more modern ages till you approach the gateway which is on the only ac∣cessible part of the rock it was defended by a deep ditch cut through a narrow neck communicating with the main land having a draw bridge this lays to the southeast and on the brink of the precipice above the sea shore The gateway is strengthened by a round tower on each side from whence passing about paces which space appears to have been formerly a covered way you approach a second and machicolated gate of a much more modern order of building having a portculice After you have passed the second gate on the left hand on a lofty point of the rock stands a very ancient round tower of great strength commanding the pass Assailants having won this approach entered upon a situation of imminent danger on a tremendous precipice sub∣ject to every kind of annoyance from the besieged who possessed the round tower This part of the fortress wears the most ancient coun∣tenance and challenges the Saxons for its origin The ingenious Mr  BAMBROUGH CASTLE  depiction of Bambrough Castle  Grose says  this is the spot where according to the Monkish Histo∣rians stood the castle or palace of the Kings of Northumberland built as it said by King Ida who began his reign A D Part of the present ruins are by some supposed to be the remains of King Ida's work    On the whole though there was undoubtedly a for∣tress or palace here in the Saxon times and perhaps earlier every part of the present buildings seems to have been the work of the Normans  On what circumstances Mr Grose grounds this general determination I cannot discover most of the northern Norman struc∣tures are of excellent masonry the buildings here are various in figure materials modes of arching windows bases and other parts The round tower I have noted is different in all those matters from the greatest part of the works and it is to a common observer marked with much greater antiquity than the Keep or main tower which I shall next describe It is impossible to prevent a disagreement in opinion on subjects of this kind where there is no certain rule to fix determi∣nation it must be the case I pay the greatest deference to Mr Grose's judgment but think he has passed this determination hastily The Keep or chief tower of this fortress is a lofty square structure of the same model with many Norman fortresses founded in or near the time of the Conqueror it stands on the crown of the rock having an open area round it but most extensive towards the north and northeast points Mr Wallis says that from the stile of the architecture of its base being of the Doric order it is believed to be of Roman work He adds  that it is well known the Saxons erected their castles when they could on Roman foundations and gave them the name of Burg or Brough  It is very probable the Romans held this part of the country to be of singular importance to their navy but that they built castles here is not by any means admissible They might erect small towers like those whose remains appear on the wall of Severus on places of special import I do not doubt the Saxons would enter upon the Roman for∣tifications for the same reasons the Normans after them made such choice the northern counties furnish a multitude of instances that the Normans possessed themselves of such situations but in those places the Roman vallum and foss only served for outworks to the Nor∣man structures The remains of the Roman station are visible at many of those fortresses In most of the places I have observed the Roman works are retained as a platform or outward area to the south sides of the castles In the northern stations of the largest size there are no re∣mains of castles Whether the Saxons or Normans entered upon those  places I do not presume to determine The scite of the Praetorium is to be traced in many but without any other appearances than of erections for domestic uses not shewing a sufficient quantity of ruins to give the least idea of a decayed castle Mr Grose says  some assert the Keep to have been a Roman structure for which supposition they give the following reasons its great similarity to the Keep of Dover Castle and the White Tower of London both allowed to be Roman the shape of its arches which are either flat or semicirculara Doric base round its bottom and the great depth of its well sunk feet through a whinstone rockThe first of these is evidently founded on a mistake neither the White Tower nor the Keep of Dover Castle being Roman but built since the conquest the last in the time of King Henry II proofs of which are to be met with in Dugdale's Monasticon the Textus Roffensis and divers other authentic records Nor is the proof drawn from the shape of its arches more conclusive semicircular and flat arches are found in almost every building erected before the time of King Henry II and from the argument deduced from its Doric base it is not at all wonderful or uncommon to find the members of Graecian architecture employed in Norman buildings One instance of this among many may be seen at the cathedral of Canterbury where a massive column placed in the undercroft to support some vast weight has a rude sort of Ionic capital Besides it is well known most of the architects of those days learned their art at Rome where they had the Graecian architecture continually before them of which indeed the Saxon was only a debased kind After the stupendous works carried on by our Norman ancestors it seems extraordinary that the digging of the abovementioned well should appear so arduous an undertaking as to be deemed possible to the Romans only Besides in Beeston Castle Cheshire there is a well full as deep cut through the solid rock and that is universally known to be the work of the Normans  The following remarks extracted from the same work will not be unacceptable to the reader  The stones with which the Keep or great tower is built are remarkably small and were taken from a quarry three miles distant From their smallness it has been conjectured they were brought hither on the backs of men or horses The walls to the front are feet thick but the other three sides are only nine The original roof was placed no higher than the top of the second story The reason for the side walls being carried so much higher  than the roof might be for the sake of defence or to command a more extensive lookout both towards the sea and land The tower was however afterwards covered at the top Here were no chimneys the only fire place in it was a grate in the middle of a large room supposed to have been the guard room where some stones in the middle of the floor are burned red This floor was all of stone sup∣ported by arches This room had a window in it near the top three feet square intended to let out the smoke All the other rooms were lighted by slits or chinks in the walls six inches broad The out∣works are built of a very different stone from that of the Keep being a coarse free stone of an inferior quality ill abiding the injuries of weather taken from the rock itself In all the principal rooms in the outworks there are chimneys particularly in the kitchen which measures feet by feet where there are three very large ones and four windows over each window is a stone funnel like a chim∣ney open at the top intended as it is supposed to carry off the steam In a narrow passage near the top of the Keep was found upwards of iron heads of arrows rusted together into a mass the longest of them about ½ inches In December in sinking the floor of the cellar the draw well was accidentally found its depth is feet cut through the solid rock of which feet is of hard whinstone In the summer of the year in throwing over the bank a prodigious quantity of sand the remains of the chapel were discovered in length feet The chancel is now quite cleared is feet long and feet broad the east end according to the Saxon fashion semicir∣cular The altar which has been likewise found did not stand close to the east end but in the center of the semicircle with a walk about it three feet broad left for the Priest to carry the Host in procession The font richly carved is also remaining  This fortress is by Florigelus Hoveden and others attributed to  Ida  Regnum Nordanhumbrorum incepit XIII  o  anno regni Kinrici Cum enim proceres An∣glorum patriam illam

Col v p  and by them esteemed nearly cotemporary with the rise of  the kingdom of Northumberland  but there are sufficient grounds to believe that there was a fortress here before  Ida  's time It is said the ancient name was  Bebbanborough  which Camden from Bede's authority imagines was  borrowed from a Queen  Bebba  but the author of the additions to Camden is of a contrary opinion as in the

Sym Dunelm  It is admitted by all writers that  Bambrough  is of great antiquity and was a fortress of singular consequence and strength in the early times of the Saxons It has furnished history with many memorable events  Penda  King of  Mercia  still remaining a Pagan breathed the most in∣veterate hatred against the Christians having obtained a victory over  King Oswald  in Shropshire in which he treated the royal captive with the most savage barbarity like a whirlwind he rushed to the destruction of his country In the year having ravaged  Northumberland  as far as  Bambrough  he laid siege to it and not being able to take the place by storm attempted to burn it by raising huge piles of wood against the walls and setting them on fire but when his machines were fully prepared and his piles were burning the wind suddenly changed and blowing a storm the blazing faggots were carried into his camp and  made a great destruction insomuch that he was obliged to raise the siege This deliverance was ascribed according to the superstition and bigotry of those times to the prayers of  Aidan  Bishop of Lindisfarn who for the sake of greater retirement and an uninterrupted devotion was then resident on the  Farn Island  afterwards famous for the cell of  St Cuthbert Oswald  's great zeal for the conversion of his people his bounties to the church and his suffering under the hand of a Pagan conqueror procured him the immortal honours of a Saint and Martyr His arms were preserved as relics in the church at  Bambrough  and were believed to remain uncorrupted through the influence of a blessing pronounced on them by  Aidan  whilst doing a singular act of charity  Symeon Dunelm ch  Nam tempore episcopatus ejus hostilis Merciorum exercitus Penda duce Nortdanhumbrorum

Northumberland  near years the Crown was usurped by  Eardulph  to the prejudice of  Osred Alfred  's eldest son then an infant of the age of eight years As this act of  Eardulph  's portended imminent peril to the young Prince  Brithrick  a zealous adherent to  Alfred  and his family seized the castle of  Bam∣brough  where he placed  Osred  It was not long before the Usurper laid siege to the place but it was so well defended as to baffle all his at∣tempts and his assaults were attended with a succession of ill fortune Whilst  Eardulph  remained before the walls the people in general de∣clared for  Osred  and having levied a considerable army advanced to∣wards the Usurper who being informed of this unexpected change in the sentiments of the people prepared to raise the siege and draw off his troops  Brithrick  at this instant made a vigorous sally the adversaries were thrown into confusion and soon routed  Eardulph  was taken pri∣soner and immediately executed and  Osred  ascended the throne of his ancestors to the great joy of his subjects  This was the place of  Alured  's retirement when he fled from  York  to avoid the dangers of civil commotion having in the ninth year of his reign been deserted by his family and nobles He was descended of  Ida  but through the misery of those times obliged to abdicate the throne of  Northumberland  and seek for safety under  Cynoth  King of the  Picts  In the reign of  King Egbert  this castle was the prison of  Cynewolf  Bishop of Lindisfarn his imprisonment began in and continued for years being accused as an accomplice in a crime of which some authors assert he was innocent  According to Florence of Worcester  Alred  the son of  Eardulph  whom  Athelstan  expelled on the death of  Sititric  who married  Athelstan  's sister and was by him raised to the Northumbrian throne in the year seized this fortress and made himself master of the dependent ter∣ritories but was soon forced to fly before the arms of  Athelstan  In the descent made by the  Danes  about the year this fortress suffered greatly but was soon afterwards restored and new works were added It is said a great booty fell into the hands of these invaders by the reduction of  Bambrough  Waltheof Earl of Northumberland  in his declining years was disturbed by an incursion of the Scots under  Malcolm  their King he retired to this fortress whilst his son  Uchtred  a valiant youth raised a few troops to oppose the army of the invader He gained an advantageous post and with great bravery made such an attack upon the undisciplined Scots that they were soon thrown into confusion and after suffering a dreadful slaughter made an inglorious conclusion of their invasion by a precipitate retreat into their own country  Uchtred  did not conduct his success with temperance he sullied his victory with cruelty inhu∣manly slaughtering in cold blood the nobility and officers of rank which were among his prisoners their heads becoming the horrid fur∣niture of the walls of  Durham  King  Ethelred  overlooked this barba∣rity and rewarded his valour by giving him in marriage his daughter  Edgiva  with a princely portion his father resigning his possessions to the young hero the King added thereto the county of  York  The sa∣vage barbarity of those times is shocking to humanity there was sel∣dom a victory obtained in the reciprocal depredations made on the  borders but the utmost cruelty and undistinguished slaughter was the consequence The warfare itself was infamous for it was no better than robbing by a Banditti commanded by Kings who sullied the lustre of a Crown by impious acts which will for ever remain ignomi∣nious in story  In the year the Danes again besieged and took this place and pillaged it  Lel Col v p  Bambrough  is said to have been in good repair at the time of the conquest when it is probable it was put into the custody of some trusty Norman and had additions made to the works as the present area contained within its walls measures upwards of eight acres instead of three as described by Hoveden  Grose  Whilst Malcolm King of Scotland was carrying his horrid ravages along the banks of Tees Gospatric made an incursion into Cumberland which the Scottish King then held by force of arms and having laid waste the country he returned to Bambrough loaden with spoils but this was succeeded by a severe revenge for Malcolm soon after entered Northumberland and after cruel depredations carried with him a mul∣titude of the inhabitants into slavery  Dum sic saevit Malcolin Cospatricius comes

on the defection of  Mowbray Earl of Northumberland  the royal troops laid siege to  Bambrough  under the command of the Sovereign the Earl having taken refuge there The King finding the place impregnable to distress the garrison and cut off all succours of men and provisions he erected a fortress in the neighbourhood according to the art of war practised in those days which was named  Malvoisin  or the bad neighbour in which he placed a strong garrison and drew off the main body of his army southward The Earl by means of a secret correspondence held with some of the  garrison of  Newcastle  had entertained hopes of making himself master of that place with that intent under covert of the night he set out from  Bambrough  accompanied by horsemen but being observed by the garrison of  Malvoisin  was pursued When he arrived at  Newcastle  he found the gates shut against him and the garrison apprized of his intention he was now reduced to the necessity of flying to the monastery of  St Oswin  at  Tynemouth  where he was besieged six days and received a wound in his leg at length he and his followers having retired to the sanctuary in defiance of the holy prescription were dragged forth and delivered up prisoners to the King  Robertus de Mulbrai comes Northumbr Gul de Auco cum multis aliis regem Gul Rufum reg vitaque privare filium Amitae illius

device then practised in sieges The King wearied with this unsuccessful procedure led forth his prisoner before the walls and threatened in∣stantly to put out his eyes and give him up to torture if the garrison did not surrender  Morael  overcome by the threatening calamity which impended on the head of his Lord capitulated and for his bravery and singular fidelity the King pardoned his offences and took him into favour at the same time sparing the Earl's life committing him prisoner to the castle of Windsor  About this period of time the following old poem seems to have been composed but to what historic fact if any it relates I have not been able to discover It was communicated to me by the Rev Mr Lamb of Norham  The LAIDLEY  This is a northern corruption for Loathly i e loathsome  WORM of SPINDLESTON HEUGHS  Virgo jam serpens sinuosa volumina versat  Mille trahens varios adverso sole colores  Arrectis horret squamis et sibilat ore  Arduaque insurgens navem de littore pulsat  A Song years old made by the old Mountain Bard Duncan Frasier living on Cheviot A D From an ancient manuscript  THE King is gone from Bambrough castle  Long may the Princess mourn  Long may she stand on the castle wall  Looking for his return  She has knotted the keys upon a string  And with her she has them ta'en  She has cast them o'er her left shoulder  And to the gate she is gane  She tripped out she tripped in  She tript into the yard  But it was more for the King's sake  Than for the Queen's regard  It fell out on a day the King  Brought the Queen with him home  And all the Lords in our country  To welcome them did come  Oh welcome father the Lady cries  Unto your halls and bowers  And so are you my stepmother  For all that is here is yours  A Lord said wondering while she spake  This Princess of the North  Surpasses all of female kind  In beauty and in worth  The envious Queen replied at least  You might have excepted me  In a few hours I will her bring  Down to a low degree  I will liken her to a Laidley Worm  That warps about the stone  And not till Childy  There is a street now called the Wynd at Bambrough  Wynd comes back  Shall she again be won  The Princess stood at her bower door  Laughing who could her blame  But e'er the next day's sun went down  A long worm she became  For seven miles east and seven miles west  And seven miles north and south  No blade of grass or corn could grow  So venomous was her mouth  The milk of seven stately cows  It was costly her to keep  Was brought her daily which she drank  Before she went to sleep  At this day may be seen the cave  Which held her folded up  And the stone trough the very same  Out of which she did sup  Word went east and word went west  And word is gone over the sea  That a Laidley Worm in Spindleston Heughs  Would ruin the north country  Word went east and word went west  And over the sea did go  The child of Wynd got wit of it  Which filled his heart with woe  He called straight his merry men all  They thirty were and three  I wish I were at Spindleston  This desperate worm to see  We have no time now here to waste  Hence quickly let us sail  My only sister Margaret  Something I fear doth ail  They built a ship without delay  With masts of the rowntree  Mountain ash  With fluttering sails of silk so fine  And set her on the sea  They went aboard The wind with speed  Blew them along the deep  At length they spied an huge square tower  On a rock high and steep  The sea was smooth the weather clear  When they approached nigher  King Ida's castle they well knew  And the banks of Bambroughshire  The Queen looked out at her bowerwindow  To see what she could see  There she espied a gallant ship  Sailing upon the sea  When she beheld the silken sails  Full glancing in the sun  To sink the ship she sent away  Her witchwives every one  Their spells were vain The hags returned  To the Queen in sorrowful mood  Crying That witches have no power  Where there is rowntree wood  Her last effort she sent a boat  Which in the haven lay  With armed men to board the ship  But they were driven away  The worm leapt up the worm leapt down  She plaited round the stane  And ay as the ship came to the land  She banged it off again  The child then ran out of her reach  The ship on Budle sand  And jumping into the shallow sea  Securely got to land  And now he drew his berrybrown sword  And laid it on her head  And swore if she did harm to him  That he would strike her dead  Oh quit thy sword and bend thy bow  And give me kisses three  For though I am a poisonous worm  No hurt I will do to thee  Oh quit thy sword and bend thy bow  And give me kisses three  If I am not won e'er the son go down  Won I shall never be  He quitted his sword he bent his bow  He gave her kisses three  She crept into a hole a worm  But stept out a Lady  No cloathing had this Lady fine  To keep her from the cold  He took his mantle from him about  And round her did it fold  He has taken his mantle from him about  And it he wrapt her in  And they are up to Bambrough castle  As fast as they can win  His absence and her serpent shape  The King had long deplored  He now rejoiced to see them both  Again to him restored  The Queen they wanted whom they found  All pale and sore afraid  Because she knew her power must yield  To Childy Wynds who said  Woe be to thee thou wicked witch  An ill death mayest thou dee  As thou my sister hast likened  So likened shalt thou be  I will turn you into a toad  That on the ground doth wend  And won won shalt thou never be  Till this world hath an end  Now on the sand near Ida's tower  She crawls a loathsome toad  And venom spits on every maid  She meets upon her road  The virgins all of Bambrough town  Will swear that they have seen  This spiteful toad of monstrous size  Whilst walking they have been  All folks believe within the shire  This story to be true  And they all run to Spindleston  The cave and trough to view  This fact now Duncan Frasier  Of Cheviot sings in rhime  Lest Bambroughshire men should forget  Some part of it in time  In the next reign it was intrusted by King  Henry  I to  Eustace FitzJohn  who was dispossessed of it and his other employments by King  Stephen  jealous of his attachment to  Maud  daughter of King Henry I  Irritated at this injury  FitzJohn  attached himself to  David  King of Scotland and levied a great force from his barony of  Alnwick  with which he openly joined the Scotch invader They marched towards  Bambrough  and made a regular attack but so far from being able to possess the place they only forced an outwork which had been lately erected and put to the sword about of the defenders by whose re∣proachful speeches they were irritated to the assault After destroying the corn hamlets and erections in the adjacent country they marched southward and in the county of  Durham  being joined by a large body  of forces from  Galloway  and  Cumberland  with  King David  at their head they advanced to  Northallerton  and soon after were defeated at the battle of  the standard  In the conditions of peace made between King Stephen and King David I of Scotland it was stipulated that the earldom of Northum∣berland should be conclusively settled on Prince Henry David's son with all its appendages except  Bambrough  and  Newcastle  which the English Monarch was to retain on Henry's receiving a compensation by lands in the south of England All the Barons within this earldom did homage to Prince Henry for their estates with a salvo for the fealty they had sworn to King Stephen it having also been premised that the laws and customs established by King Henry I in Northumberland should remain in force This treaty was ratified at Durham in the month of April A D in the presence of Maude Queen of Eng∣land and a great assembly of the Barons of both nations and there∣upon the King of Scotland and his son entered into compact for the maintenance of peace with England during their lives for the observ∣ance of which Cospatric Earl of March Hugh de Morvill Fergus Mel and Mac were given as hostages  King Henry II in the third year of his reign had restored to him by Malcolm IV King of Scotland the northern territories which King Stephen had granted to David King of Scotland and therewith King Henry was put in possession of the city of Carlisle the castle of Bam∣brough and Newcastle upon Tyne It is presumed by some authors that David having taken advantage of the broils in which King Ste∣phen was involved had seized the castle of Bambrough as in the treaty when the earldom of Northumberland was resigned to Prince Henry this fortress and Newcastle were expressly reserved to the Crown of England  In the th year of  King Henry the Second's  reign some great work seems to have been added to this fortress as in Madox's History of the Exchequer under the article of Amercements it appears one  William  son of  Waldef  was fined five marks for refusing his assistance in the King's works at  Baenburg Castle  he was fined also s to have a re∣spite touching the said works Perhaps at this time  the Keep  was built its great similarity to that of  Dover  the work of that reign makes it at least probable  Grose  In the time of King Richard I  Hugh Bishop of Durham  held this castle but his power was of short date for the King being offended at his insolence disseized him of this place together with the county of  Nor∣thumberland  and imposed on him a fine of marks  William Heron  son of  Jordan Heron  who held a barony in this county by the service of one Knight's fee as his ancestors had done from the conquest was in the d year of King Henry III constituted Governor of  Bambrough Castle  and of  Pickering  and  Scarbrough  in Yorkshire in which appointments he was succeeded in the th year of the same reign by  John Lexington  Knt Chief Justice of the Forests North of Trent  In King Edward I summoned  John Baliol  King of Scotland to renew his homage at this castle but the proud vassal forgetting his fidelity contemned the command and levied an army to resist the English arms if Edward entered his kingdom Edward burning with indignation at this insolence marched to  Berwick  which he took by storm and put the garrison to the sword From thence proceeding to  Dunbar  near which place the Scotch army waited his approach an engagement ensued in which the English were victorious the field of battle was covered with innumerable carcasses Scots some His∣torians assert fell that day  Dunbar  was taken and  Baliol  was made prisoner The great trophy of this victory was  the stone chair  in which the Kings of Scotland had been crowned from the earliest times This was the  palladium  of the Scotch the loss of which shook the superstition of the whole empire This  chair  was brought in triumph to England with the King in chains and was placed in  the abbey of Westminster  where it has remained for regal honours ever sincea degree of appro∣priation which nothing but the bigotry and superstition of that age could have decreed to it in England  To increase the superstitions import of this  palladium  of  monarchy  it is reported that it contains or is composed of the stone of  Bethel  on which  Jacob  slept when he had the beatific vision and received the promises of inheritance from the voice of the Supreme  Isabel de Beaumont  related to  Eleanor  Queen of Edward I sister to Lord Henry Beaumont and widow of  John de Vesey  afterwards wife of  John Duke of Brabant  had a grant of this castle for her life on proviso that she did not marry again During her possession  Piers de Gaveston Earl  of Cornwall  was protected here from the vengeance of an injured and incensed nobility In he was dragged from the castle of  Scar∣brough  and given up to the hands of his adversaries  In the year this castle on the marriage of the Lady Vesey was reassumed by government and given to Lord Percy  Carte II Dug I  In Earl Murray being taken prisoner by King Edward III was committed prisoner to this castle from whence he was removed to Not∣tingham and lastly to Windsor  It was held for a short time by  Roger Heron  a younger son of  William Heron  before mentioned after which it was conferred on  Henry Percy  for his good services in the Scotch wars In this family it continued for several ages and a grant of this castle together with the manor and fee farms of the town was made to his grandson for life In the reign of King Henry VI  Henry Percy Earl of Northumberland  was Constable During the contention between the King and the House of  York  there were divers Governors according to the party which hap∣pened to be victorious  Sir Ralph Grey  and  John Lord Wenlock  were both of them Constables for Henry VI the latter in the th year of that King he nevertheless sided with King Edward IV and served under him at  Towton  In the second year of the reign of King Edward IV an insurrection of the Lancastrian party appearing in the North the King advanced to  Northumberland  and at once laid siege to the three castles of  Alnwick Dunstanburgh  and  Bambrough  Ten thousand forces invested the latter under the command of the  Earl of Worcester  the  Earl of Arundel  the  Lord Ogle  and the  Lord Montecute  the  Duke of Somerset  the  Earl of Pembroke Lord Roos  and  Sir Ralph Percy  maintained the fortress until Christmas eve when it was surrendered The Lords  Pembroke  and  Roos  effected their escape and the  Duke of Somerset  and  Sir Ralph Percy  received the royal pardon The  Queen  still struggling against the tor¦rents of adversity such in the whole as royalty seldom ever experi∣enced again made head in  Northumberland Sir Ralph Grey  surprized the castle of  Bambrough  which was then in the keeping of  Sir John Astley  and he garrisoned it with Scotch troops but the battle of  Hex∣ham  Levels  soon put a final end to these commotions and gave a con∣clusive blow to the hopes of the House of  Lancaster Sir Ralph Grey  and  Sir Humphrey Nevill  were excepted in the general pardon  Nevill  soon afterwards suffered at  York  but  Sir Ralph Grey  knowing his perilous estate held out the castle of  Bambrough  until July The Lords  Montecute  and  Warwick  conducted the siege A tower being beat down by the canon  Sir Ralph  received such bruizes by its fall that he was taken up for dead and the garrison dismayed at the catastrophe im∣mediately surrendered It was  Sir Ralph  's fate to survive the day and afterwards to suffer death as a traitor at  York  The damages the castle had sustained were not repaired in that or the succeeding reigns King Henry VII and King Henry VIII both esteemed those castles as places of refuge only for malecontents From the time of King Edward IV there is a total suspension of its history By the escheats of the th of Queen Elizabeth it appears to be in the Crown with the adjoining castle of  Dunstanburgh Sir John Foster  of  Bambrough Abbey  was then Governor of this castle His grandson  John Foster  Esq  had a grant of the manor of  Bambrough  from King James but in the year his descendant forfeited and it was purchased by his uncle  Lord Crew  I am indebted to Ralph Spearman  Esq  of Eachwick in the county of Northumberland for the following curious survey taken by inquisition of this castle its rights and

necessary in this place to take a particular view of the charity of  Lord Crew  who purchased the forfeited estates of the Fosters  In Mr Randal's Manuscripts it is stated that  Bambrough was afterwards granted to his grandson Claudius Forster  Esq  Mar King James I Dorothy the only child of William Forster Knt marrying Nathaniel Lord Crewe Bishop of Durham and Baron of Steane in the county of Northampton July brought with her the estates of Bam∣brough and Blanchland She died without issue  "His Lordship left by will dated June th the said estates to charitable uses  There are several good rooms furnished in the tower Dr R Trevor Bishop of Durham held a confirmation at Bambrough on Sunday August th for that parish and dined with Dr Sharp at the castle in the large room where the manor court is held  Randal's Man  It is not arrogant to say that his bequests have furnished the most exalted degree of charitable distribution that ever flowed from a private do∣nation in this country  Lord Crew's will bears date the th June and he died the th of September in the th year of his age at Stene the seat of his ancestors in Northamptonshire The appropriations which parti∣cularly relate to  Bambrough  are the sole objects of my present atten∣tion I cannot describe them to the reader in more expressive language than that of the worthy and learned traveller Mr Pennant from whose works I will select a few sentences  The castle and the manor belonging it was once the property of the Forsters but purchased by Lord Crew Bishop of Durham and with other considerable estates left vested in Trustees to be applied to unconfined charitable uses Three of these Trustees are a majo∣rity  one  Dr Sharp  of them makes this place his residence and blesses the coast by his judicious and humane application of the Prelate's gene∣rous bequest He has repaired and rendered habitable the great square tower the part reserved for himself and family is a large hall and a few smaller apartments but the rest of the spacious edifice is allotted for purposes which make the heart to glow with joy when thought of The upper part is an ample granary from whence corn is dispensed to the poor without distinction even in the dearest time at the rate of four shillings a bushel and the distressed for many miles round often experience the conveniency of this benefaction  Other apartments are fitted up for shipwrecked sailors and bedding is provided for should such a number happen to be cast on shore at the same time A constant patrol is kept every stormy night along this tempestuous coast for above miles the length of the manor by which means numbers of lives have been preserved Many poor wretches are often found on the shore in a state of insensibility but by timely relief are soon brought to themselves  It often happens that ships strike in such a manner on the rocks as to be capable of relief in case numbers of people could be sud∣denly assembled for that purpose a cannon  Once belonging to a Dutch frigate of guns which with all the crew was lost opposite to the castle about years ago  is fixed on the top of the tower which is fired once if the accident happens in such a quar∣ter twice if in another and thrice if in such a place By these signals the country people are directed to the spot they are to fly to and by this means frequently preserve not only the crew but even the vessel for machines of different kinds are always in readiness to heave ships out of their perilous situation  In a word all the schemes of this worthy Trustee have a humane and useful tendency he seems as if selected from his brethren for the same purposes as Spenser tells us the first of his seven beadsmen in the house of holinesse was  The first of them that eldest was and best  Of all the house had charge and government  As guardian and steward of the rest  His office was to give entertainment  And lodging unto all that came and went  Not unto such as could him feast againe  And doubly quite for that he on them spent  But such as want of harbour did constraine  These for God's sake his dewty was to entertaine  That all seamen may be informed of the circumstances of this cha∣rity a printed account is published under the direction of the Trinity House in Newcastle upon Tyne and which is subjoined in the notes  An Account of the Signals made use of at Bambrough Castle in the county of Northumber∣land in case ships or vessels are perceived in distress and of the charitable institutions estab∣lished there for their assistance and relief now published by the direction of the Trustees of Nathanael late Lord Crewe with the approbation of the Master Pilots and Seamen of the Trinityhouse in Newcastle upon Tyne  SIGNALS  I A gun a ninepounder placed at the bottom of the tower to be fired as a signal in case any ship or vessel be observed in distress viz once when any ship or vessel is stranded or wrecked upon the islands or any adjacent rock twice when any ship or vessel is stranded or wrecked behind the castle or to the northward of it thrice when any ship or vessel is stranded or wrecked to the southward of the castle in order that the customhouse officers and the te∣nants with their servants may hasten to give all possible assistanceas well as to prevent the wreck from being plundered  II In every great storm two men on horseback are sent from the castle to patrol along the coast from sunset to sunrise that in case of an accident one may remain by the ship and other return to alarm the castle Whoever brings the first notice of any ship or vessel being in distress is intitled to a premium in proportion to the distance from the castle and if between twelve o'clock at night and three o'clock in the morning the premium to be double  III A large flag is hoisted when there is any ship or vessel seen in distress upon the Fern Islands or Staples that the sufferers may have the satisfaction of knowing their distress is per∣ceived from the shore and that relief will be sent them as soon as possible In case of bad wea∣ther the flag will be kept up a gun fired morning and evening and a rocket thrown up every night from the north turret till such time as relief can be sent These are also signals to the Holy Island Fishermen who by the advantage of their situation can put off for the islands at times when no boat from the main land can get over the breakers Premiums are given to the first boats that put off for the islands to give their assistance to ships or vessels in distress and provisions and liquors are sent in the boats  IV A bell on the south turret will be rung out in every thick fog as a signal to the fishing boats and a large swivel fixed on the east turret will be fired every fifteen minutes as a signal to the ships without the islands  V A large weathercock is fixed on the top of the flagstaff for the use of the pilots  VI A large speaking trumpet is provided to be used when ships are in distress near the shore or are run aground  VII An observatory or watch tower is made on the east turret of the castle where a person is to extend every morning at daybreak during the winter season to look out if any ships be in distress  VIII Masters and Commanders of ships or vessels in distress are desired to make such sig∣nals as are usually made by people in their melancholy situation  Assistance Stores and Provisions prepared at Bambrough Castle for Seamen Ships or Vessels wrecked or driven ashore on that coast or neighbourhood  I Rooms and beds are prepared for seamen shipwrecked who will be maintained in the castle for a week or longer according to circumstances and during that time be found with all manner of necessaries  II Cellars for wine and other liquors from shipwrecked vessels in which they are to be de∣posited for one year in order to be claimed by the proper owners  III A storehouse ready for the reception of wrecked goods cables rigging and iron A book is kept for entering all kinds of timber and other wrecked goods giving the marks and description of each with the date when they came on shore  IV Four pair of screws for raising ships that are stranded in order to their being repaired Timber blocks and tackles handspokes cables ropes pumps and iron ready for the use of shipwrecked vessels  N B But if taken away to be paid for at prime cost  V A pair of chains with large rings and swivels made on purpose for weighing ships of a thousand tons burthen that are sunk upon rocks or in deep water  N B These chains are to be lent gratis to any person having occasion for them within forty or fifty miles along the coast on giving proper security to redeliver them to the Trustees  VI Two mooring chains of different lengths are provided which may occasionally be joined together when a greater length is required  VII Whenever any dead bodies are cast on shore coffins c will be provided gratis and also the funeral expences paid  December the th  TRINITYHOUSE NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE  We the Master c of this house desire the Trustees to make their humane intentions public By order THOMAS AUBONE Secretary  It is much to be lamented that this example has not induced the bene∣volent to adopt the plan on the southern coasts by which many acts of barbarity might be prevented and valuable lives saved to the public  The reader will form a perfect idea of the extent of Lord Crew's charity in a department distinct from that of seamen under the above description by the following tables published in the Newcastle news∣papers  Annual account of the charitable institution at Bambrough Castle for the relief of sick and lame Poor from Oct to Oct  Remaining on the books Oct    Outpatients admitted since

charity to flow from a private bounty is singular men in former ages were canonized for trifling acts of benevolence compared to this But although the resources were given by Lord Crew yet the disposition was not of his arrangement to the benevo∣lent heart of  the Rev Dr Sharp  the chief part of the blessings derived from his Lordship's will is to be attributed He resides many months in each year in  the castle of Bambrough  superintends the works of charity has his eye open upon every new channel by which he may give relief or consolation to his suffering fellowcreatures The shipwrecked and the diseased are comforted by his visitation and the calamities of life  are all alleviated by his care It is an exalted duty the blessed spirits of heaven are described to us as dispensing the gifts of universal bene∣volence  In regard to natural strength there is not a situation in all Northum∣berland equal to that of Bambrough or one in any wise so well adapted to the ancient rules of fortification From the great tower there is an extensive sea and land prospect you overlook the whole group of  Farn Islands  you view  the castle of Holy Island  which from thence makes a very formidable appearance and on the more distant peninsula you discern the town and fortifications of  Berwick  On the other side  Dun∣stanborough Castle  crowns the nearest cliffs behind which a winding shore is seen with many little promontories creeks and bays beauti∣fully mingled and graced with multitudes of small vessels laying in their ports or under sail The extreme point of view is  Tynemouth  whose ruined monastery gives an obelisk to terminate the landskip All the inland prospect gradually inclines towards the sea banks with many considerable swells displaying a fine cultivated scene to the eye varied with innumerable villages and hamlets  THE FARN ISLANDS  possess little matter of sufficient consequence to tempt a traveller to sea especially where there is so constant a ripling and breaking of the waves as is to be found between them and the continent  The effect of oil on troubled waters mentioned lately as a modern and accidental disco∣very was known in very distant ages it was practised in this country and esteemed a miracle Indeed most of the miraculous works of the religious were deduced from some knowledge of the simplest principles of nature discovered and displayed in ages of profound ignorance In Bede's third book of the history of the Church of England touching the miracles wrought by Aidan this practice is thus mentioned  A certain priest named  Utta  a man of great gra∣vity and sincerity and one who for his qualities and truth was well esteemed was commis∣sioned to go into Kent for  Eanflede  King  Edwine  's daughter who after her father's death had been sent thither in order to her espousal with King  Oswin  He was to travel by land to Kent but to return by sea on which account he addressed Bishop Aidan beseeching him to put up fervent prayers to God to prosper their Voyage The Bishop gave them his bles∣sing and having recommended them devoutly to the protection of God he also delivered to Utta some jars of hallowed oil saying I foresee that whilst you are at sea a sudden tempest will come upon you remember to cast into the troubled waters the oil that I give you and and speedily the tempest shall be assuaged the sea be calmed and you shall have a pleasant passage All these things were fulfilled according to the prophecy At the beginning of the tempest when the waves and surges chiefly raged the sailors endeavoured in vain to cast anchor but the storm increased and the waves multiplied so fast that the vessel was almost filled with water and nothing but immediate death presented itself In this distress the Priest had recourse to the Bishop's directions and took the pot of oil some of which he cast into the sea and the sea was immediately calmed the sun soon after shone forth and the ship proceeded with a prosperous voyage Thus the man of God through the spirit of pro∣phecy predicted the tempest and by the same holy spirit though he was himself absent appeased the same  In the month of  August when we visited the islands the sea was tumultuous making a violent inset between them and the main land They are in num∣ber the largest and only one we thought worth attending to is the  House Island  nearest to  Bambrough  where  St Cuthbert  made his resi∣dence Mr Pennant visited them all and has the following remarks which as the work of a very able Naturalist highly merit a place here  There ly certen isles adjoining to Farne Island bigger then Farne itself But in them is no habitation Certn bigge foules caullid S Cuthbertes byrdes brede in them and puffins birdes less than dukkes having grey fethers like dukkes but without painted fethers and a ring about the nek be found breding ther in the cliffy rokkes  Lel Itin vol  Opposite to  Bambrough  lie the  Farn Islands  which form two groups of little isles and rocks to the number of but at low water the points of others appear above the surface they all are distinguished by particular names The nearest isle to the shore is that called the  House Island  which lies exactly one mile chains from the coast the most distant is about seven or eight miles They are rented for l per annum their produce is kelp some few feathers and a few seals which the tenant watches and shoots for the sake of the oil and skins Some of them yield a little grass and serve to feed a cow or two which the people are desperate enough to transport over in their little boats  Visited these islands in a coble a safe but seemingly hazardous species of boat long narrow and flatbottomed which is capable of going through a high sea dancing like a cork on the summits of the waves  Touched at the rock called  Meg  whitened with the dung of cor∣vorants which almost covered it their nests were large made of tang and excessively faetid  Rowed next to the  Pinnacles  an island in the farthest group so called from the vast columnar rocks at the south end even at their  sides and flat at their tops and entirely covered with guillemots and shags the Fowlers pass from one to the other of these columns by means of a narrow board which they place from top to top forming a narrow bridge over such a horrid gap that the very sight of it strikes one with terror  Landed at a small island where we found the female Eider ducks at that time fitting the lower part of their nests was made of sea plants the upper part was formed of the down which they pull off their own breasts in which the eggs were surrounded and warmly bedded in some were three in others five eggs of a large size and pale olive colour as smooth and glossy as if varnished over The nests are built over the beach among the loose pebbles not far from the water The ducks sit very close nor will they rise till you almost tread on them The drakes separate themselves from the females du∣ring the breeding season We robbed a few of their nests of the down after carefully separating it from the tang found that the down of one nest weighed only three quarters of an ounce but was so elastic as to fill the crown of the largest hat The people of this country call these St Cuthbert's ducks from the Saint of the islands  "Besides these kinds I observed the following  "Puffins called here Tom Noddies  "Ankshere Skouts  "Guillemots  "Black Guillemots  "Little Anks  "Shiel Anks  "Shags  "Corvorants  "Black and white Gulls  "Brown and white Gulls

breed in rabbitholes  "Rock Pigeons  "Rock Larks  The Terns were so numerous that in some places it was difficult to tread without crushing some of the eggs  The last isle I visited was the  House Island  the sequestered spot where  St Cuthbert  passed the two last years of his life Here was af∣terwards established  a Priory  of Benedictines for six or eight Monks subordinate to  Durham  A square tower the remains of a church and some other buildings are to be seen there still and a stone coffin which it is apprehended was that of St Cuthbert At the north end of the isle is a deep chasm from the top to the bottom of the rock communicating to the sea through which in tempestuous weather the water is forced with vast violence and noise and forms a fine  jet d'eau  of sixty feet high it is called by the inhabitants of the opposite coast the  Churn  The horrible description given of this island by ancient authors be∣fore  St Cuthbert  blessed it with his presence is already mentioned  I am apt to doubt whether Aidan ever made any other retreat to these islands than merely occasional and for no longer stay than to put up his supplications to heaven on singular events where from greater privacy he might possess more fervour of mind than he could command in the cells of a convent  Here the Saint built himself a cell and a small oratory which he sur∣rounded with a wall that cut off his view from every thing but the heavens those who visited him only conversed through a grate not having access to his presence  Farne dicitur insula medio in mari posita c sed aliquot milibus

landing place where the brethren who came to visit him lodged After the death of  St Cuthbert Ethelwold  who took on him the religious habit at  Ripon  resorted to this hermitage and possessed it years ending his life there  Felgild  succeeded  Ethel∣wold  and in the time of that Hermit  Eadfrid  Bishop of Lindisfarn restored from its foundations the oratory of St Cuthbert which had gone to ruin Bede relates that  Felgild  was more than years old when he wrote the Life of St Cuthbert Besides the persons mentioned by Bede there were other devotees who chose  Farn  for the place of their retreat  St Bartholomew  was one as appears from a manuscript History of his Life in the Bodlean Library who obtained leave of  Lawrence  Prior of Durham to go to  Farne  where he found one  Elwyn  in possession of the desirable residence and whose religion was not suffi∣ciently tempered with charity to induce him to welcome the stranger  Bartholomew  wrote in this retreat his Farne Meditations now

Melsonby to the See The King opposed this election esteeming him disaffected to his govern∣ment because he had been Prior of Coldingham and sworn fealty to the King of Scotland and there was singular danger in having a Bishop of Durham under any attachment to the King of Scotland as in right of his See he would possess places of great strength and importance more particularly he would hold a large tract of sea coast and many havens where the shipping and troops of France and Flanders might be received These objections not being esteemed of sufficient impor∣tance to the Monks for them to renounce their right of election or fearing new innovations from regal power they appealed to the See of Rome but the messengers charged with this matter died in their pas∣sage  and Melsonby being intercepted as he attempted to leave the king∣dom he resigned his title to the Episcopacy on the th of April A D having contested his claim three years In the year the King advancing towards Newcastle with his army the Prior was struck with new apprehensions of danger as he dreaded resentment for the conduct he had shewn under his election to the See consequently he resigned his office of Prior and retired to Farn Island where the Hermit Bartholomew then was in occupation of the sacred cell of St Cuthbert Here the Prior spent the remainder of his life in devotion and austerities He was buried in the cathedral church of Durham among the Bishops and many miracles were said to be wrought at his tomb  Whart Aug Sax v p  Alexander  II King of Scotland confirmed by deed to the Monk  Henry  and his successors in Farn Island s sterling in free alms to be re∣ceived annually out of the farm of his mill at  Berwick  instead of half a chalder of corn granted to him by the charter of King William  In

the island a little lawn skirts the edifices surrounded with rugged rocks from whence issues a spring of fresh water Since the departure of the religious this island has re∣turned almost to its pristine state it consists of a few acres in its whole surface the chief part of which is sand and rock A scanty herbage takes place indeed in some spots especially on the little lawn but there is neither tree or shrub The shore is rocky and sounding to the hollow sea which rolls upon it sends forth a horrid howling the northeast winds blow fiercely here and every inclemency of weather known to the climate beats on these inhospitable shores which are tremendous from frequent shipwrecksThere is not a coast more likely to give one the idea of shoals of wandering spirits who visit the  semisepulta Ossa  over which they loiter on this side Styx whilst unfriendly whirlwinds wreck them over with sand and forbid the funeral rites for which they languish  We left  ELLINGHAM  on our right hand the seat of one of the  Haggerston  family an ancient barony of the family of  Guagy  who possessed it in the time of King  Henry I as appears by the Testa de Nevil it was afterwards the pos∣session of the  Hetons  Sir Allan de Heton acquired great honour in the siege of Berwick under Henry Percy Earl of Northumberland  Holl Chron vol  The church was founded by Ralph de Guagy in the pontificate of Hugh Pudsey Bishop of Durham  We passed through  EMBLETON  the ancient barony of the family of  Viscounts  as is shewn by the escheats of King Edward I and the Testa de Nevil it is said afterwards to have become annexed to the Dutchy of Lancaster and now is the property of the Earl of Tankerville  Some authors assert that in this parish was born  Duns Scotus  Johannes Scotus  born at  Dunston  a Franciscan Friar got the title of  Doctor Subtilis  He maintained against the  Thomists  that the blessed Virgin  was conceived with sin  He died of a fit of an apoplexy at  Colen  England's Worthies  The famous Doctor  Joannes Duns  alias  Scotus  lived in the time of  Bishop Lamberton  he died He was born in the town of  Duns  in the county of  Mers  and being yet a child after some taste he had got of the Latin tongue by the perswaision of two Minorite Friars went to  Oxford  studying Logic in  Morton College  then applying himself to scholastic Divinity grew to such a perfection therein as he was called the  subtle Doctor  and was followed of a number who after his name are called to this day  Scotistae  After he had professed a while at  Oxford  he was called to read divinity in the university of  Paris  and from thence went to  Colon  where he died of the apoplexy They write that after he was laid in grave his spirits did re∣turn and that striving to get forth he was there smothered whereupon an Italian did write this epigram  Quaecunque humani fuerant jurisque sacrati  In dubium veniunt cuncta vocante Scoto  Quid quod et dubium illius sit vita vocata  Morte illum simili ludificante stropha  Quam non ante virum vita jugularet adempta  Quam vivus tumulo conditus ille foret  The English writers contend that this  Scotus  was born in  England  in  Dunstane  village within the parish of  Emilden  in the county of  Northumberland  and confirm it by the manu∣scripts reserved in the Library of  Merton Collge  in one whereof are written these words  Explicit actura subtilis Doctoris in Universitate Oxoniensi super libros sententiarum Doctoris Joannis Duns nati in villa de Emilden vocata Dunstan contracta Duns in comitatu Northumbriae pertinens ad Domum scholasticorum de Marton Hall in Oxonio quondam dictae Domus socii  But this is no sufficient proof for it may be probably supposed that he living at  Oxford  in  England  when the wars were so hot betwixt the two kingdoms did dissemble his country and pretend himself to be an Englishman born to eschew the hatred of the Students In  Colen  where he might without danger shew of what country he was he did profess himself a  Scot  and the  Minorites  of which order he was did therefor upon his tomb erected in their church at the end of the quire nigh unto the high altar set this inscription which is there yet to be seen  Scotia me genuit Anglia suscepit  Gallia edocuit Germania tenet  What a fine subtle wit he had the monuments left by him to posterity do witness He died young in the year  Spotswood's Hist Ch of Scot  that learned Sectary and claim for their evidence his manuscript works in  Merton College Oxford in which is an entry to this effect  John Duns born in a certain little village or hamlet within the "parish of Emil∣don called Dunston in the county of Northumberland"  In Camden we find his lamentable exit thus mentioned  But he died miserably be∣ing taken with an apoplexy and over hastily buried for dead whilst upon return of life nature though too late was about to throw off the violence of the disease and he making a lamentable noise calling for help after he had for some time beat his head against his coffin he dashed out his own brains and at last yielded up his vital breath  In our road to  Dunstanbrough  we had a view of  ROCK  a little village situate on an eminence commanding a fine prospect It was a dependent manor and member of the barony of Alnwick The family of  Rocks  possessed it in the time of King Edward I as ap∣pears by the escheats of that reign  We now approached the ruins of  DUNSTANBURGH  DUNSTANBOROUGH CASTLE  which though extensive have at a distance a ragged and confused ap∣pearance Nothing remains but the outworks on two sides to the land viz the west and south which with stupenduous cliffs to the sea en∣close  a plain nearly square consisting of about nine acres The Keep and interior works if there ever were any are totally gone the ploughshare having passed within the walls  Within the circumference of which there grew not long since Winchester bushels of corn beside several cart loads of hay  Gibson's Camden  The rocks to the north are per∣pendicular of a columniary form about feet in height black and horrible the shore rugged covered with broken rocks woven over with seaweed From the edge of the sea cliffs on the northwest point the western wall runs along the brink of an elevated rock a square tower arises near the center of this wall of a considerable height and of ex∣cellent masonry placed on a projecting point of the cliff so as to af∣ford to the armed men within a means of flanking the wall with their missile weapons on each corner there was an exploratory turret This seems to be the most modern part of the castle built of the best mate∣rials and by the ablest workmen Where the land rises to the summit of the rock on the southwest point the wall turns and makes a long straight front to the south as represented in the plate the ground be∣fore it is level and appears to have been assisted by art to form a more commodious parade for the garrison In this front there is a gateway built in a very remarkable stile being the great entrance to the castle it is formed by a circular arch with a portico and interior gate is defended by two heavy semicircular towers uniting with the super∣structure of the gateway these towers after rising about feet and containing two tiers of apartments support turrets of a square form now so very rugged and ruinous as not to allow a conjecture what was their original height This wall extends to the cliffs on the sea banks is guarded by two square bastions and a small sallyport and is termi∣nated by a square tower with a gateway On the brink of the cliff to the sea on this quarter appear the remains of a very strong wall indeed it is probable the whole Area was originally so enclosed The heavy seas which break upon the rocks of the northwest point have torn them much and it appears as if the area had been originally of greater extent than at present many separate columns of rock standing near the cliffs which some ages ago may have been joined to the main land At the south point of the area is the well near to the eastern tower are the remains of a chapel Immediately below this tower is a gully or passage of perpendicular sides formed in the rocks about yards in length and feet deep where the sea makes a dreadful inset breaking into foam with a tremendous noise the spray  occasioned thereby is driven within the castle walls This place is called by the country people  the Rumble Churn  The gulph from the walls of the tower which I ascended to obtain the view has a very awful appearance you look immediately down upon the abyss where as the tide rushes up the waters are lifted many feet above the common level rising towards the walls of the tower as if they would sur∣mount the cliffs and deluge the plain The breaking of the waves in foam over the extreme point of the rocks the heavy spray the noise of the disturbed waters and the groan which echo returns through the desolated towers are noble though tremendous  The date of this castle is fixed by authors to the beginning of the th century  Thomas Earl of Lancaster  General of the confederate army which opposed King Edward II being said to be the founder He was also owner of  Pomfret Castle  where after being taken by the King's troops at  Burrowbridge  he was imprisoned and soon after de∣collated as a traitor though afterwards he was canonized and the place of his martyrdom took the name of  St Thomas's Hill  He was possessed of immense estates and was the most powerful and opulent subject in Europe holding at once the Earldoms of  Lancaster Lincoln Salisbury Leicester and Darby  The King sat personally on his trial a remarkable circumstance he died th March and was buried on the south side of the high altar in the priory church there Such veneration was paid to his tomb as the enthusiasts wasted on that of Becket The King of his royal clemency remitted the severities of his sentence by which he was condemned to be hanged and quartered an infamy which seldom had fallen on those of royal descent he being grandson of King Henry III But so fluctuating are human affairs that the ignominious exit of this Earl gave exalted honours to his name after his death he was enrolled in the list of Martyrs was canonized and his portrait placed among those of sacred memory in the cathedral of St Paul's  The

Leland still remains being  ALNWICK CASTLE  depiction of Alnwick Castle  kept in good repair and now forming a part of the mansionhouse The church was rebuilt by the st Sir Harry Grey though he was not the patron  We now gained a sight of the town of  ALNWICK  and as we approached from the northeast had a most pleasing prospect of the  palace  of  the Duke of Northumberland  THE CASTLE OF ALNWICK  The situation is not naturally elegant the aspect being rather confined and the adjacent lands affording no original beauties The opposite hills rise tamely and are not yet brought into such order as to possess artificial graces enough to conceal the want of that variety and beauty which a traveller wishes to find surrounding so noble a palace The woody banks of the  Aln  with all the wild romantic scenes which hang upon her borders are excluded from the prospect The castle stands upon a fine elevation rising gradually from the river whose open banks are turfed and kept in the most exact neatness under the gardener's scythe but withal possessing that trim countenance given by straight lines and angles level walks and slopes of a mechanical formality a  garb in which nature doth not look the most lovely  The castle  is a noble structure rebuilt on the old foundation and in the Saxon style the architect has strictly preserved the whole modes and ornaments of the original the battlements are crowded with effigies according to the taste of the Normans in whose time it underwent a principal repa∣ration these represent men in the act of defence wielding such arms as were then used some of them are disposed with great propriety the guard of one of the gateways is in the attitude of casting down a mighty stone on the heads of assailants The building is of a beautiful freestone in chisel'd work its form is singular being composed of a cluster of semicircular and angular bastions I cannot without the ichnography of the place give the reader a more competent idea of its figure than by comparing it to a section of the clustered Saxon pillar in our cathedrals This edifice stands in a spacious area which at the time of its greatest strength I presume totally surrounded it defended by a compleat circumvallation and a moat otherwise the principal part of the fortress would have lain unguarded by any outwork except a moat At present the front is opened to the northeast and the wall having towers at proper intervals shuts it in on the other quarters As we viewed the castle on our approach the walls with its towers formed a noble flanking to the principal structure to the southward the gar∣den grounds appeared prettily disposed to the north and west the town of Alnwick was seen spreading on the back ground We lamented the want of some of those fine woodlands and lofty grey rocks which impend over the Aln above Alnwick to give rural and romantic graces to objects so imperial if I may be permitted to use the expression in distinguishing this noble edifice  We passed over an elegant stone bridge on our approach to the town the battlements formed of interwoven crescents we found the Inn crowded with people of fortune come from all parts of the county to pay their compliments to the Duke and Duchess  Her Grace was living when the author made his tour and compiled this work He should think himself happy could he compose an Eulogium equal to so eminent and illustrious a cha∣racter  it being their first public day after their arrival at this palace for the summer recess  The approach to the castle retains much of the solemn grandeur of ancient times the inscription on the gateway still legible  Esperance  me comforteth  appertained to the arms of the Percies and was placed there when the repairs were made by that family the moat is drained and the ceremony of letting down the drawbridge is forgot but the walls which enclose the area still wear the ancient countenance of strength and defiance You enter by a machicolated gate defended by an upper tower and after passing a covered way approach the in∣terior gate which admits you to the area this entrance is defended by all the devices used in ancient times iron studded gates portcullis open galleries and apertures in the arching for annoying assailants The ingenious traveller Mr Pennant had been out of humour when he vi∣sited this place We met with all the inconveniences of a noisy and crowded Inn with every awkward circumstance which could befall tra∣vellers who had undergone no little fatigue in pursuing the paths of pleasure and yet we could not submit to coincide with that gentle∣man's sentiments  You look says he in vain for any marks of the grandeur of the feodal age for trophies won by a family eminent in our annals for military prowess and deeds of chivalry for halls hung with helms and hauberks or with the spoils of the chace for exten∣sive forests and venerable oaks Ye look in vain for the helmet on the tower the ancient signal of hospitality to the traveller or for the greyheaded Porter to conduct him to the hall of entertainment The numerous train whose countenances give welcome to him on his way are now no more and instead of the disinterested Usher of the old times he is attended by a Valet eager to receive the fees of admit∣tance  I must beg leave to pronounce that though the savage fero∣city of the feodal ages is taken away yet not the marks of grandeur we saw no miserable dungeons filled with captives no places of execu∣tion groaning under their execrable burthen the towers remain but without the cry of captivity and torture Hospitality cloathed in princely array sits in the hall dispensing with a brow of benignity mixed with features of the highest magnificence gifts worthy her hand the Duke and Duchess are easy of access and of an affable deportment their vi∣sitants are happy under their smiles without being awed by their emi∣nence The attention they pay to the petitions of dependents is marked with the greatest benevolence no vain promises are given to still im∣portunity no hopes are flattered without sinceritythe strictest honour attends the most trivial actions A truly great principle distinguishes these noble personages amidst a happy liberality there is so exact a propriety and such perfect oeconomy that no transaction passes in the household without a certain rule and singular regularity The innu∣merable  charities they pour forth are bestowed with such admirable propriety that each person relieved at the gate brings a ticket as an authority to the officer for the dispensation of his Lord's bounty so that improper objects cannot deceive or crafty knaves obtain the por∣tion assigned for the relief of the truly necessitous and meritorious ob∣ject To enumerate acts of benevolence is inconsistent with my plan but some are so singularly worthy the world's attention that I cannot resist the pleasure of relating a single transaction which on my hearing it brought tears of joy into my eyes  Her grace returning from an airing in her chariot passed through the ranks of people in the gateways who attended to receive a daily distribution to the poor A widow oppressed with grievous necessity could not leave her domestic employment or her labour to attend with her ticket she entrusted it to her daughter a girl about seven years of age who took her parent's place at the gate Her Grace observed this girl employed in knitting whilst all the rest of the indigent group sat with idle hands she sent a servant to bring the child to her who received the message with astonishment and apprehension she followed the mes∣senger with trembling steps revolving in her mind the supposed offences she had committed and looking with eyes swimming in tears on the illfated work she held in her hand as the cause of her Grace's dis∣pleasure Pale with apprehension of reproof she approached the Du∣chess confusion and dread were mixed upon her features whilst looks of timid innocence lived in her eyes Her grace perceived the child's distress but conceived not the cause When the infant had recollected courage enough to give her the power of expression she began a faul∣tering and fearful excuse for the supposed crime she had committed in knitting at the gate a smile of divine benevolence arose upon the Du∣chess's countenancesimplicity and native innocence have great charms she was won by the child's sensibility as well as by her industry The girl was taken from her indigent mother cloathed and put to school where she is acquiring those accomplishments which one day will ad∣vance her above the rank of her humble progenitors  The inside of this palace is finished in a most splendid taste every thing to use Mr Pennant's expression being compleated with  an in∣compatible elegance  A particular account of suits of apartments finished and furnished in the highest manner would be tedious the rich variety is for the eye only The chief descriptions I will

and chargeable to be repayred  Alnwick Castle contains about five acres of ground within its outer walls which are flanked with towers and turrets that now afford a compleat set of offices to the castle and maintain many of them their original names as well as their ancient use and destination  "These are  I The Great or Outward Gate of entrance anciently called the Utter Ward  II The Garner or Avener's Tower behind which are the stables coachhouses c in all respects suitable to the magnitude and dig∣nity of this great castle  III The Water Tower containing the cistern or reservoir that sup∣plies the castle and offices with water Adjoining to this is the laun∣dry c  IV The Caterer's Tower adjoining to which are the kitchens and all conveniencies of that sort  Behind the adjacent walls are concealed a compleat set of offices and apartments for most of the principal officers and attendants in the castle Together with a large hall or diningroom to entertain the tenants at the audits with an office for the auditors house∣keeper's room and underneath these a servantshall with all other suitable conveniencies  "V The Middle Ward  "VI The Auditor's Tower  "VII The Guard House  "VIII The East Garret  IX The Record's Tower of which the lower story contains the evidence room or great repository of the archives of the barony over it is a circular apartment designed and executed with great taste and beauty for a banquetting room being feet diameter and feet inches high  X The Ravine Tower or Hotspur's Chair Between this and the round tower was formerly a large breach in the walls which for time immemorial had been called by the town's people the Bloody Gap  XI The Constable's Tower which remains chiefly in its ancient state as a specimen how the castle itself was once fitted up  XII The Postern Tower or Sally Port The upper apartment now contains old armour arms c The lower story has a small furnace and elaboratory for chymical or other experiments  "XIII The Armourer's Tower  "XIV The Falconer's Tower  XV The Abbot's Tower so called either from its situation nearest to Alnwick Abbey or from its containing an apartment for the Abbot of that monastery whenever he retired to the castle  "XVI The West Garret  The castle properly consists of three courts or divisions the en∣trance into which was defended with three strong massy gates called the Utter Ward the Middle Ward and the Inner Ward Each of these gates was in a high embattled tower furnished with a port∣cullis and the outward gate with a drawbridge also they had each of them a porter's lodge and a strong prison besides other necessary apartments for the constable bailiff and subordinate officers Under each of the prisons was a deep and dark dungeon into which the more refractory prisoners were let down with cords and from which there was no exit but through the trap door in the floor above That of the inner ward is still remaining in all its original horrors  This castle like many others in the north was anciently orna∣mented with figures of warriors distributed round the battlements and therefore the present noble proprietors have allowed them to be continued and have supplied some that had been destroyed but to shew what they once were and that this is no innovation they have retained the ancient ones though defaced which were placed on the top of the two octagon towers  From length of time and the shocks it has sustained in ancient wars this castle was become quite a ruin when by the death of Al∣gernon Duke of Somerset it devolved together with all the estates of this great barony c to the present Duke and Duchess of Northum∣berland who immediately set to repair the same and with the most consummate taste and judgment restored and embellished it as much as possible in the true Gothic style so that it may deservedly be considered as one of the noblest and most magnificent models of a great baronial castle  Nothing can be more striking than the effect at first entrance within the walls from the town when through a dark gloomy gateway of considerable length and depth the eye suddenly emerges into one of the most splendid scenes that can be imagined and is presented at once with the great body of the inner castle surrounded with fair semicircular towers finely swelling to the eye and gayly adorned with pinnacles figures battlements c  The impression is still further strengthened by the successive en∣trance into the second and third courts thro' great massy towers till the stranger is landed in the inner court in the very center of this great citadel  Here he enters to a most beautiful staircase of a very singular yet pleasing form expanding like a fan the cornice of the ceiling is in∣riched with a series of escutcheons displaying the principal quar∣terings and intermarriages of the Percy family The space occupied by this staircase is feet long feet inches wide and feet inches high  The first room that presents to the left is the saloon which is a most beautiful apartment designed in the gayest and most elegant  style of Gothic architecture being feet inches long feet inches wide and feet inches high  To this succeeds the drawingroom consisting of one large oval with a semicircular projection or bowwindow It is feet inches long feet inches wide and feet high  Hence the transition is very properly to the great dining room which was one of the first executed and is of the purest Gothic with nitches and other ornaments that render it a very noble model of a great Baron's hall In this room was an irregularity in the form which has been managed with great skill and judgment and made productive of beauty and convenience This was a large bowwindow not in the center but towards the upper end which now affords a very agreeable recess when the family dine alone or for a second table at the great public dinners This room is feet inches long feet inches wide exclusive of the circular recess which is feet in diameter and feet inches high  From the diningroom the stranger may either descend into the court by a circular Staircase or he is ushered into a very beautiful Gothic apartment over the gateway commonly used for a breakfast or supperroom this is furnished with closets in the octagon towers and is connected with other private apartments It is feet inches long feet wide and feet inch high  Hence the stranger is conducted into the library which is a very fine room in the form of a parallelogram properly fitted up for books and ornamented with stuccowork in a very rich Gothic style being feet long wide and feet inch high This apart∣ment leads to  The chapel which fills all the upper space of the middle ward Here the highest display of Gothic ornaments in the greatest beauty has been very properly exhibited and the several parts of the chapel have been designed after the most perfect models of Gothic excel∣lence The great east window is taken from one of the finest in York minster The ceiling is borrowed from that of King's college in Cam∣bridge and the walls are painted after the great church in Milan but the windows of painted glass will be in a stile superior to any thing that has yet been attempted and worthy of the present more im∣proved  state of the arts Exclusive of a beautiful circular recess for the family the chapel is feet long feet inches wide and feet high  Returning from the chapel through the library and passing by another great staircase that fills an oval space feet inches long and feet inches wide we enter a passage or gallery which leads to two great statebed chambers each feet long most nobly fur∣nished with double dressing rooms closets and other conveniencies all in the highest elegance and magnificence but as conformable as possible to the general stile of the castle From these bedchambers the passage opens to the grand staircase by which we first entered and compleats a tour not easily to be paralleled  I must now turn my attention to the antiquity and history of this place  Mr Grose says  it is believed to have been founded in the time of the Romans although no part of the original structure is now re∣maining But when part of the dungeon or castle keep was taken down to be repaired some years ago under the present walls were discovered the foundations of other buildings which lay in a diffe∣rent direction from the present and some of the stones appeared to have Roman mouldings "The dungeon or keep of the present castle is believed to have been founded in the Saxon times The zigzag fretwork round the arch that leads into the inner court is evidently of Saxon architecture and yet this was probably not the most an∣cient entrance for under the flag tower before that part was taken down and rebuilt by the present Duke was the appearance of a gate∣way that had been walled up directly fronting the present outward gateway into the town"  The first proprietor of the  barony of Alnwick  named in history is

Rufus being required by King Malcolm of Scotland to fulfil the articles concluded upon in the truce made in gave the Scotch Monarch assurances of their completion upon his repairing to his court to which he ordered him to be honourably conducted On his arrival he was received with great insolence and contempt being refused admittance to the King's presence who insisted that Malcolm should submit his claim to the judgment of the English peers Malcolm with a becoming dignity refused alledging if there was any dispute to his title it should be settled on the Marches by men of both nations agreeable to the laws and customs established there The English Mo∣narch not consenting to such proposition Malcolm returned in high displeasure and was not long before he shewed his resentment by en∣tering the borders with a powerful army accompanied by Edward his  son they laid waste the county of Northumberland to the environs of Alnwick and besieged the castle The most authentic account of the tragical events of this siege seems to be that given in the ancient Chro∣nicle of Alnwick Abbey of which a copy is preserved in the British Museum Mowbray  A D Rex Scottorum Malcholmus

they came upon them unexpectedly on Saturday the th day of July whilst the principal parts of his vast army were scattered over the country in acts of rapine and violence and the others laying in an idle and unsuspicious security before the castle a conflict ensued in which the King's horse was killed under him and many of his attendants were slain the King being made prisoner The straggling parties were put to the route or taken to a great amount in number before they gained intelligence of the real force of their opponents and the King of those robbers after being confined some time in Richmond Castle was removed to London and afterwards ransomed for l at the same time doing homage for his crown as a memorial of which submission he deposited his arms at the altar in York Minster  In the reign of King John A D  Eustace de Vesey  being accused of a conspiracy against the King's life fled into Scotland His castle was ordered to be rased but the apprehension of a southern rebellion diverted the purpose  Eustace  with the northern Barons A D at  Felton  did homage to Alexander II King of Scotland his brotherinlaw which so much incensed King John that he poured forth into the north a large army laid  Felton  in ashes together with the towns of  Mitford Morpeth Aln∣wick Wark  and  Roxburgh  Whilst John made these dreadful depreda∣tions in Northumberland the Lord  Eustace  with King Alexander made an incursion as far as  Barnardcastle  in the country of Durham to which they laid siege and being out on horseback to take a view of the for∣tress in order to plan an assault making too near an approach  Eustace  lost his life by an arrow shot from some of the outposts  What greatly contributed to prolong the intestine troubles of Henry the Third's kingdom in was the despair of the rebel Barons by the forfeitures of their estates under the determinations of the parlia∣ment of Winchester  John de Vesey  was one of them and having been  deprived of his castle and barony of Alnwick he entered into a combi∣nation with several others labouring under the same proscription for the recovery of their possessions  Vesey  raised a sufficient force to gain his castle but Prince Edward coming against him with a strong body of forces reduced his garrison to such distress that he was obliged to surrender and submit himself to the Prince's mercy through whose intercession he received the royal pardon  In this  John de Vesey  was summoned to parliament in the th year of King Henry the Third's reign This was the glorious aera in which our mode of parliaments was first settled and Commons regu∣larly admitted to a share in the legislative power He died in the th year of the reign of King Edward I And in the th year of that reign A D died  William de Vesey  the last Baron of that family who having no ligitimate issue but leaving a son born out of wedlock did by the King's licence enfeof  Anthony Beck  Bishop of Durham and ti∣tular Patriarch of Jerusalem in the castle and Barony of Alnwick in trust for such natural son but this Right Reverend Guardian got the infant deprived of his barony and as he acquired other royal favours also obtained a confirmation from the King of a sale made thereof to Henry Lord Percy Baron of Topcliff and Spofford in Yorkshire an ancestor of the present illustrious family  Mr Grose says but from what authority he is not pleased to point out  that the appointment of the infant's Guardians as also the very words of the deed of enfeofment now extant in which the convey∣ance is to the Bishop absolute and unconditional confute a report too hastily taken up by some Historians that this castle and barony were only given to the Bishop in trust for William the Bastard above men∣tioned and that he was guilty of a violation of this trust in disposing of them otherwise  It would have been well if Mr Grose could have shewn where this deed was to be seen as it would in some measure have exonerated the Bishop's memory of this infamous charge and would have set Historians right for the future Rymer III au∣thorizes the contrary determination I do not remember an instrument of that antiquity which contains an express trust but where a trust was premised it was merely confidential or expressed in some separate deed Trusts were introduced by the Lawmen to evade the statute of uses made in the reign of King Henry VIII and from that period gained their legal acceptation  The castle and barony of Alnwick continued in the Bishop's possession years  Grose  before he granted them to Lord Percy The Bishop's deed bears date the th of Nov and doth not indeed wear the counte∣nance of an obscure transaction for the witnesses to it were some of the greatest personages in the kingdom viz Henry Lacy Earl of Lincoln Robert de Umfreville Earl of Angus Robert Lord Clifford c the grant was afterwards confirmed by the King at Sheene d Jan to H Percy and his sons who Mr Grose says  to remove every pre∣tence of complaint obtained a release of all right and title to the in∣heritance from the heir at law  Sir Gilbert de Aton  Knt who was the nearest legitimate relation to the Lord  William de Vesey  above men∣tioned  I must confess Mr Grose's argument with me tends not to exculpate the Bishop but to confirm the suspicion of his guilt Such a ratification of title in my apprehension tells a consciousness of defects had the bastard son confirmed the doubt would have been taken away  Antoninus de Bek c  Castrum de Alnewick quod ei Gul de Vesey contulerat confidens in eo quod illud ad opus

victory at  Towton  One  Peter de Brezè  a Frenchman being under his Sovereign's displeasure and in prison was restored to liberty on con∣dition of his entering into the service of the King of Sicily the father of Margaret of Anjou and conducting the troops raised for her service into England  Brezè  landed on the Northumberland coast with about  men at arms he possessed the castle of Alnwick which was soon after besieged by Lord Hastings Sir Ralph Gray and Sir John Howard The garrison was reduced to great distress when George Douglas Earl of Angus influenced to this service by great promises from Margaret advanced unexpectedly to the besiegers with horsemen and making such manoeuvres as induced the English army to apprehend he meant to attack them whilst they were forming themselves in order of battle he brought a strong party up to the postern gate to whom the garrison made a sally and being mounted on horses brought for that purpose or behind the armed horsemen the small garrison evacuated the fortress being only in number and fled without bloodshed It is believed the garrison before they retired endeavoured to destroy all the arms and ammunition they could not carry off for a few years ago on opening the principal well in the inner ward which had been long filled up the workmen found in it a great number of cannon balls of a large size such as were chiefly used after the first invention of gun∣powder  Margaret in the month of October following making another ef∣fort by the treachery of Sir Ralph Gray the Governor was again put in possession of  Alnwick Castle  but King Edward soon approaching with a numerous army and finding no forces in the field to oppose him Margaret having again retired into Scotland he laid siege to the three great fortresses of  Alnwick Dunstanborough  and  Bambrough  at the same time The troops which invested  Alnwick  being in num∣ber were under the command of the Earl of Warwick the Earl of Kent the Lord Powis the Baron of Graystock and Lord Cromwell  Alnwick  held out till the th of January the French General  Brezé  having made an ineffectual effort to relieve it  I must trespass upon the reader so far as to introduce in this place a short account of  the illustrious family of Percy  This family is descended from  Mainfred de Percy  who came into  Normandy  from  Denmark  before the adventure of the famous  Rollo  and had issue  Geffrey  who took part with  Rollo  in his expedition into that province of which he obtained the Sovereignty being the first Duke of that country and lineal ancestor to  William Duke of Normandy  and King of England  Glover  the  Somerset Herald  in the reign of Queen Elizabeth set forth this as an undoubted genealogy of the family  Geffrey  had issue  William de Percy Lord Percy  and Earl of Kaws Governor of Normandy who had issue  Geffrey de Percy  who married  Mary  daughter to the Earl of Forest who had issue  William de Percy  who had issue  Geffrey  all born in  Normandy  The last  Geffrey  had issue two sons  William  and  Serlo  who came into England with  William the Conqueror  Lord Percy made a solemn feast  In Alnwick's princely hall  And there came Lords and there came Knights  His chiefs and Barons all  With wassel mirth and revelry  The castle rung around  Lord Percy call'd for song and harp  And pipes of martial sound  The minstrels of thy noble house  All clad in robes of blue  With silver cressents on their arms  Attend in order due  The great achievements of thy race  They sung their high command  How valiant  Mainfred  o'er the seas  First led his northern band  Brave  Galfred  next to Normandy  With virtuous  Rollo  came  And from his Norman castles won  Assum'd the  Percy  name  They sung how in the Conqueror's fleet  Lord  William  ship'd his powers  And gain'd a fair young Saxon bride  With all her lands and towers  Then journeying to the holy land  There bravely fought and died  But first the silver cressent wan  Some Paymin Soldan's pride  They sung how  Agnes'  beauteous heir  The Queen's own brother wed  Lord  Josceline  sprung from  Charlemagne  In princely  Brabant  bred  How he the  Percy  name reviv'd  And how his noble line  Still foremost in their country's cause  With godlike ardour shine  With loud acclaims the listning crowd  Applaud the masters song  And deeds of arms and war became  The theme of every tongue  Piercy's Hermit of Warkworth  William  was a great favourite of this Prince and by his bounty held large possessions in Hampshire lordships in Lincolnshire and lordships in Yorkshire Topcliff in the North Riding and Spofford in the West Riding being his chief seats He left a great patrimony in France to the Lord  Monpensier  Madox in his  Baronia Anglicana  says that William the Conqueror granted to his favourite  Percy  a barony of Knights fees  This  William de Percy  was surnamed  Le Gernon  or  Algernon  he was possessed of the lordship of Whitby with the large territory

battle of  Bannocksburn  when the English sustained a shameful de∣feat  In the history of Stirlingshire lately published this battle is particularly mentioned with some singular circumstances not noted in the account given thereof page c in this vol The most material are That the Scots army was flanked on one hand by Woodlands the de∣files of which would greatly impede the English horse That the Scotch army before engaging kneeled down to prayers which suppliant posture the English apprehended was to denote their submission and that they begged their lives a conceit in the author as improbable as ridicu∣lous no credulity or confidence in the authority could reconcile so simple a tale to common sense That after the English army were put to the rout Glocester attended by his military tennants made a desperate effort to retrieve the lost honours of the day in which he fell That on the day of the general engagement Robert Bruce being attacked by Sir Henry Boyn∣ton slew him with a battle ax which was a signal to the Scotch army for the onset These are material variances from the relations of other authors and in the above work appear unsupported  On the death of  Robert

the commotions subsided when he received restitution of ho∣nours and lands the Isle of Man excepted This restoration was at∣tended with a great solemnity in the presence of the assembled estates of the kingdom The Commons gave thanks to the King in full par∣liament for the favour shewn to the Earl of Northumberland The same day at their request the King commanded the Earls of Northum∣berland and Westmoreland in token of perfect amity to kiss each other in open parliament and to take each other by the hand thrice which they did The same ceremony passed between the Earls of Nor∣thumberland and Dunbar on the d February then following But the death of  Hotspur  and the neglect shewn the Earl of Northumber∣land from the Crown enraged him so much that in the succeeding year he openly joined the northern malcontents and again took up arms against the King The royal army soon appeared in the north seized the Earl's castles of  Alnwick  and  Warkworth  and drove the party to seek refuge in Scotland A scheme was projected to surrender up this turbulent Earl but he gaining intelligence of the design escaped and afterwards levied a sufficient force to enter England and recover his castles

in all  Colling's Peerage  The sixth Earl  Henry  was deeply in love with the fair  Anne Bullen  but by the art of Cardinal Woolsey and even the royal interposition was withdrawn from an attachment which it is said gave great anxiety to the Sovereign Notwithstanding the Earl's early affection for the Cardinal in he was one of the King's Commissioners to arrest him for high treason He was Warden of the East and Middle Marches and one of the Knights of the Garter He married  Mary  daughter of George Earl of Shrewsbury and died without issue  As his brother  Thomas  had been attainted the

consideration of his noble descent con∣stancy of virtues valour in deeds of arms and other shining qualifications  The ceremony of his creation at Whitehall was attended with great pomp  the procession was preceded by    heralds and    trumpeters he was accompanied by the Earls of Pembroke Arundel and Rutland and the Lord Montague walking in the middle dressed in robes of crimson velvet a hat of crimson velvet and a coronet of gold  He was joined with Lord Wharton as Wardens General of the Marches with very extensive powers A D He commanded against the Scots who made an incursion the

prisoner He with his brother  Henry  having entered Scotland in the following year obtained a victory over the Scotch near  Swinton  and the same year engaged the French auxiliaries with equal success near  Grindon  In jealousy of Lord Cecil's power with Queen Elizabeth he entered into the northern conspiracy and at length appeared in open rebellion It would be inconsistent with my plan in this place to speak upon that matter it will suffice to add that the Earl having fled into Scotland was betrayed and delivered up and in the th year of Queen Elizabeth he and his Countess were convicted of high treason and out∣lawed  and on the d of August he was beheaded at  York  avowing with his last breath the Pope's supremacy affirming the realm to be in a schism and the subjects who were obedient to the Queen no better than heretics  Hollingshead Speed and Stowe  He married  Ann  daughter of Henry Somerset Earl of Worcester by whom he had one son and five daughters the son died without issue  The patent of restoration made by Queen Mary having limited the titles and estates to the late Earl's heirs male and in default of such issue to  Henry Percy  the Earl's brother in the th of Queen Eliza∣beth he was summoned to parliament by the distinction of  Earl of Nor∣thumberland and Baron Percy  On his brother's defection he stood loyal to the Queen and with Sir John Forster commanded the troops which on the th of Decem∣ber in the th of Queen Elizabeth routed the Earl of Westmoreland's forces in  the bishopric of Durham  In the th year of Queen Elizabeth being suspected of plotting to set at liberty the Queen of Scots he was committed prisoner to the Tower and on the st of June was found dead in his bed having three shots from a pistol lodged under his left pap his chamber door being fastened on the inside He married  Ca∣tharine  eldest daughter and coheiress of John Nevill Lord Latimer by whom he had issue eight sons and three daughters  Henry  his eldest son succeeded him  the ninth Earl of Northumberland  He was one of those volunteer Lords who hired vessels to accompany Charles Lord Howard Lord High Admiral against  the Spanish Armada  Being suspected as an accomplice in the Gunpowder Plot he suffered a long and grievous confinement in the Tower  Wood in his Athenae Oxoniensis says  That the Rev Mr Nathaniel Torporley a noted Mathematician being made known to the great Earl of Northumberland Henry Percy the generous favourer of all good learning was received into his patronage and had a pen∣sion paid yearly unto him several years from his purse Thomas Hariot went in with Sir Walter Raleigh to Virginia where he was employed in the discovery and surveying thereof After his return into England Sir Walter got him into the acquaintance of that noble and generous Earl who finding him a gentleman of an affable and peaceable nature and well read in the obscure parts of learning he did allow him a yearly pension of l About the same time Robert Hues and Walter Warner two other Mathematicians who were known also to the said Earl did receive of him yearly pensions also but of less value as did Torperley So that when the said Earl was committed prisoner to the tower in Hariot Hues and Warner were his constant companions and were usually called the Earl of Northumberland's  Magi  They had a table at the Earl's charge and the Earl did constantly converse with them and with Sir Walter Raleigh then in the tower  Their prison was an academy where their thoughts were elevated above the common cares of life explored science in all its pleasing

liberty till the th of July having been confined years  In the th year of King Charles I he obtained a confirmation to him and the heirs male of his body of the title and dignity of  Baron Percy  in as ample a manner as his ancestors had enjoyed the same He died at his seat at  Petworth  on the th of November He married  Dorothy  daughter of Walter Devereux Earl of Essex by whom he had issue four sons and two daughters His two eldest sons dying in in∣fancy he was succeeded in title and estates by his third son  Algernon  His Lordship's brother Henry Percy was a representative in parliament for Northum∣berland but was expel'd th December King Charles I for endeavouring to en∣gage the northern army to free his Majesty from the Parliament Fetters "pour mettre le Roy hors de Peine" as he terms it to keep up his Majesty's revenue to maintain Bishops in their rights and functions He was betrayed after a solemn oath taken by Colonel Goring after∣wards a General of horse under the Earl of Newcastle With some difficulty and peril he escaped their vengeance History has drawn his character in most amiable colours His countenance was awful and commanding respect His mind liberal and stored with know∣ledge civil and military This made him as able a General in the field as he was a prudent and wise Counsellor in the cabinet In the former he awed the parliament by his manage∣ment and address and in the latter embarrassed their measures in both firm and intrepid more formidable by his wisdom than his power tho' that was great which he employed with the ardour and zeal of a patriot in the service of a  good Master  who to reward him created him a Peer by the stile and title of Baron Percy of Alnwick th June He also made him Lord Chamberlain and give him in charge a treasure he loved well the conduct of his Queen to Oxford When the power of the parliament was too enormous to oppose he retreated beyond sea leaving behind him a great estate c preferring before them a spotless loyalty and an unwounded honour  Wallis  Algernon the  th  Earl of Northumberland  was about years of age when he succeeded to the honours of his ancestors Lord Clarendon says  that the King took him into his immediate and eminent care and prosecuted him with all manner and demonstration of respect and kindness and as he heard his Majesty himself say courted him as his mistress and conversed with him as his friend without the least interruption or inter∣mission of any possible favour and kindness  On the th May King  Charles I he was installed one of the Knights of the Garter He was made Lord High Admiral for his services against the Dutch in He bore the following titles  Lord of the honours of  Cockermouth  and  Petworth Lord Percy Lucy Poinings FitzAine Bryan  and  Latimer Knight of the

Captain General of the army to act against the  Scots  He at∣tended King Charles I into Scotland on his coronation In the th year of that reign he was installed one of the Knights of the Garter and in the th year he was made Lord High Admiral of England In the th he was made Captain General of the army In his Lordship was at the head of state affairs In a letter to the Earl of Leicester he thus expressed his sentiments of public matters  It grieves my soul to be involved in these councils and the sense I have of the miseries that are like to ensue is held by some a disaffection in me but I regard little what those persons say  In he with the Earls of Pembroke and Salisbury with several Members of the House of Commons were indicted of high treason at  Salisbury  before Judges Heath Forster and Glanvill for assisting the parliament but they could not induce the jury to find the bill On the th of May by order of the Lords the Earl and his Countess were directed to take care of the

family live all the heroic virtues of their ancestors I must give a place to the following oration spoken at Guild∣hall Westminster by the Reverend Mr Bennet on Tuesday July the th on placing the picture of  Earl Percy  in the council cham∣ber of that hall  Gentlemen  Notwithstanding your worthy Chairman has so fully expatiated on the cause of this chearful and respectable meeting I feel myself animated not less from inclination than duty to offer a few words with your permission on the present occasion  Public virtues and singular acts of greatness have ever kindled in the mind of man an ardent desire of beholding the persons or repre∣sentations of those in whom they shone hence examples of great and generous actions have been continually handed down to posterity for their imitation and incitement to gloryhence Caesarhence Cato live and their virtues remain unsullied by the grave amidst the rust of time  Rome had its heroesBritain boasts of hers and when Percy is no more that picture shall record his deeds  At a time when the supreme legislative authority of parliament over the whole British empire was called in question at a time when  discord disobedience nay rebellion itself prevailed in Americaat a time when dissipation and every species of luxury pervaded this great nation and its direful influence was visibly increasingEarl Percy disdaining every consideration that was unconnected with the com∣mon weal boldly stood forth a champion for his country a friend to his King and enemy to those who had fallen from their duty  It was not wealth gentlemen that could urge him to so dangerous an undertakingFortune had placed him above the pursuit of it it could not be ambition for rank and titles were already his own but it was public spirit that called him forthfor he had  all to lose  but  nothing to gain  nothing but the true interest of his country to acquire He gave up his own safety he made a sacrifice of every thingpleasures profit and interestall were subservient to the common good  Without flattery gentlemen I may assert Rome would have gloried in such a real Patriot Rome would have rejoiced to have seen one of their Nobility so strenuous in their country's cause  But this was not all and what I have said would bear but little resemblance to that great man were I not to take notice of his un∣bounded humanity as well as public spirit  His tenderness in a time of the greatest calamity his readiness in sharing whatever his ample fortune afforded him with the common soldier the widow and the orphan has raised his name almost above the reach of praise  Great as his own distress was he overlooked it in commiserating and relieving that of others indeed every humane and generous fea∣ture of the noble Duke his father are clearly seen in the actions of the son  But it is not to be wondered at gentlemen that humanity genero∣sity and magnificence should shine forth with so much lustre in the noble Earl when they are the acknowledged characteristics of  the House of Northumberland  The town of Alnwick  Alnwick Alnewick or Alnewicke in Saxon  implying a town of two fathoms length In the Deanery of Alnwick and in Coquetdale Ward  Randal's Manuscripts  From the Manuscripts of  Roger Gale  Esq Extract of a letter from Mr  Gale  to Sir  John Clerk  th June  I had lately an account from Alnwick of some brass weapons found there by a mason as he was clearing the earth from a rock about a mile N W from that place within the old park  to get up some stone After having dug about half a yard deep in the ground he came to sword blades and spear heads lying close to the top of the rock without any case or cover than the soil The swords were exactly of the same shape as those in the st plate of Mr Gordon's book N  o  and or inches long Some of the spears resembled and in the same but others were broader and cut thro' as in the margin Dig∣ging about a foot lower on the hill side he found brass wedges or chiz∣zels with a ring near their thicker end of which I doubt not but you have seen many and so need not give you any description of them but that they are not unlike N  o  in Mr Gordon's th plate How and for what they were used I will not take upon me to determine absolutely but by their edges which are much broken and battered they seem to have been employed as chizzels for cutting stone I believe they put a wooden shaft in the hollow end of them and so drove them with a mallet  Sir Laurence's System of Agriculture and Gardening where he mentions some of these found in the small joints and  vices of the stone in a quatry near Bishop Weremouth which is no weak confirmation of my conjecture  If the soft∣ness of the metal and consequently its unfitness for such work is objected I answer that when they had not a harder necessity would compel them to use such as they had besides most sorts of stone are so soft when they lie bedded in and at their first coming out of the quarry that they might make a very good shift to cut it and cleave it with their tools while it was under those easy circumstances to which I may add that these brass chiz∣zels are of a much harder temper than we know how to give that metal as are also their swords which are made of it and other weapons  The shaft when not employed might be drawn out of the chizzel and by running a string thro' the ring on their sides several of them might be tied together and conveniently carried by the workman at his girdle or otherwise and one shaft serve them all About eight years ago near a bushel of them were found at Cave upon the banks of the Humber in Yorkshire under a little Tumulus by the highway side and what is very remarkable every one of them was enclosed in a matrix of the same metal or case fitting it so exactly that it seemed to be cast in it and so fresh and whole were the edges of them all as if they had never been used  A little above the place where the swords and spears were buried at Alnwick was deeply and rudely cut in the rock but I cannot think these figures had any relation to what was sound below I have had the good fortune to get a sword and spear and chizzels  The Sword Spear Hea  d and of the Chissels I presented to my Lord H  rtford  for a crown piece the rest were seized by the Duke of Somerset's Steward upon pretence of securing them for his Grace but were never sent to him So many of these brass chizzels have been found in this island and so few any where else and those only in France that they seem almost to have been the peculiar tools of the Britons their near alliance and intercourse with the Gauls easily accounting why they have been sometimes discovered in the antient seat of the latter The swords and spear heads aforementioned being found so near these chizzels and of the very same metal is an argument that they belonged to the same people which I can∣not think to have been Romans who as I formerly ventured to give you my opinion seem to have left off the use of brass in their weapons before their arrival in this island The word Ferrum much earlier than that time denoted in their authors all manner of military weapons and was a general name for them which I think is some additional strength to my former argu∣ments on that subject  I am c R GALE  Sir  John Clerk  's Answer th Aug  I return you thanks for the account you sent me of the Antiquities found at Alnwick their number surprised me much Some of the same kind have been found here in Cairns nothing in Antiquity is more mysterious than the use of these Instruments of brass which resemble small hatchets or chissels I incline to think them warlike instruments as we generally take the stone hatchets to be I have or of both kinds When they came first into my hands I set about reading such accounts as had been given of them and found that one Mr Hearne had taken a good deal of pains to prove they were Roman His dissertation is printed in Mott's Collection of the Transactions of the Royal Society v part p But I cannot be of that gentleman's opinion The Romans understood better the expeditious ways of doing things than to make use of such slight and brittle tools We must then ascribe them to the ancient Bri∣tons who used instruments of brass before iron came to take place What makes me judge they were not chissels is that the Britons made very little use of hewn  The Stones at Stonehenge are hewen  stone and for that reason little or nothing of their stone monuments does remain It is indeed probable they made use of them for repairing their highways for all such instruments found here were in Cairns  Cairus are burying places and therefore usually situated near Highways so that the finding these Tools near Highways is merely accidental  R G  situ∣ated near these ways and those in my possession have induced me to think that our great highways in Britain were not Roman but British  How then were they warlike instruments  I am glad you have got one of the swords I wish I knew how to get one of the same kind from the Duke of Somerset  I am c JOHN CLERK  is irregular being built on the declivities of a hill in various directions the buildings are chiefly modern and  some of them approach to elegance It is  the county town of Northumber∣land  and an unrepresented borough governed by a Bailiff nominated by his Grace his authority derived from the obsolete office of Con∣stable of the Castle and four Chamberlains chosen annually out of the freemen of the town  The freedom  of this borough was one of King John's institutions who in a ridiculous humour ordained that it should be obtained by passing through a deep and miry pond on the Town Moor  Alnwicke Moor formerly bore the name of the Forest of  Aidon  There is a tradition that King John made this foolish institution as a perpetual mark of his displeasure on account of his having been thrown from his horse in the bogs of this forest upon his dreadful visit to the north  upon St Mark's day which still to render more ludicrous the candidate is to perform in white cloathing and sometimes it is ef∣fected with the utmost peril What immunities or privileges are gained by this unhappy mode of accession I never could learn the trade of Alnwick with every advantage of exclusive exercise is insignificant  and the appendages of the borough are of no great moment  Machell

highly finished and decorated the Shambles and Font There is an ancient and immemorial custom retained here on the proclamation of the several fairs Divers adjacent townships which are free of toll in the borough by this service send their Representatives to attend the Bailiff on the eve of the fair when he makes proclamation after which they keep watch all night in every quarter of the town  The

 John Vesey returning from the Holy War is said to have first brought Carmelites into England and to have built a Convent for them here at Holme a solitary place and not un∣like Mount Carmel in Syria But in truth there never was any Convent or Monastery founded at Alnwick or near it by John Vesey there was indeed a Monastery of the Order of the Prae∣monstratenses founded by Eustatius Fitz John father of William de Vesey who had the sir∣name from his mother an heiress But this was done in the year long before the Car∣melites were heard of in England John Bale who was sometime a Carmelite himself tells us that the first convent of that order was founded at Holme Hull they now call it near Alnwick by Ra Fresborn a gentleman of Northumberland who died A D and was buried in the Convent

excluded from those beautiful scenes The way to  Huln  forms one of the sweetest and most romantic rides in the county where nature has left the lands open art has happily disposed her works with the justest taste to supply the vacancy The entrance is by a steep de∣scent to the vale through which the river winds its course The road by traversing the hills obliquely renders the way easy to the passenger it is cloathed on each hand with plantations of various kinds of forest trees mingled with great judgment and so disposed that the pines and evergreens give an agreeable variegation of colour in the foliage without deadening the scene Nothing can be more gloomy than longextended lines of dusky firs which as the Poet  Mason  justly observes  blot the horizon  These plantations are bordered on each side of the road with a variety of flowering shrubs and tufts of flowers After passing this agreeable grove by irregular windings we descended into a plain washed by the solemn stream of sleepy  Aln  which scarce appears to flow so dull it seems in this romantic valley shut in on every hand by lofty eminences covered with wood forming a spacious theatre near two miles in circuit On the right hand the river forms a semi∣circle the opposite shore composed of shaken and perpendicular rocks over whose brink impends a forest of oaks rising shade above shade up to the crown of the mountains As the  Aln  passes away from this sweet vale and glides from under the feet of those romantic rocks she doth not even yield a murmur or a sigh except where constrained by some artificial wears she turns over with indolence and falls again to sleep on the succeeding lake  After passing this plain the vale grows narrow the hills and woods are loftier and the river here and there frets over a few pebbles which im∣pede her passage Here is every sylvan beauty here we tasted enjoy∣ment of all the pleasures of a woody scenethe richness of the forest hues the deep shadow and the refreshing breeze perfumed by wood∣binetogether with that solemnity and stillness which sooth the con∣templative mind  As we winded thro' this deep valley the prospect at length opened upon the scite of  Huln Abbey  on the left hand the landskip was ab∣ruptly closed with rugged mountains of naked white rocks opposed to  which on the right on a grassy eminence stand the remains of the monastery humbly mourning in the lowly garb of solitude and bending down in ruins over which a tower of the Percys bears the melancholy air of unavailing defence and overlooks the mouldering walls with an aspect of despondency in its inability to shield off the strokes of time and devastation We ascended to the summit of the hill and being possessed of the keys by which alone we could have had access to these retreats we flattered ourselves no obstacle could arise that might deprive us of the sight of the ruins of this religious house and every thing curious there but the whole is enclosed with a lofty wall the interior ground being disposed in gardening we found the keeper of this place a little man of a mean and insolent aspect he heard our request with the door in his hand after which with a contemptuous silence he walked in and turned the key against us as if he was afraid we should discover some theft he was committing against his Lord Thus excluded and looking ridiculous enough we could do nothing more than ride round the walls by which we ob∣served that the ruins chiefly consisted of a small chapel wanting little besides a roof the tower a square building with exploratory turrets at each corner is in good repair fitted up as a pleasure room command∣ing a beautiful prospect as we could sufficiently judge from our lower situation  The view from this eminence into the vale which we had passed was singularly beautiful the ragged rocky and barren mountain which now lay on our right afforded a bold contrast to the hanging forests and the planted eminences which intersected the winding val∣ley the Aln was seen in meanders down the nearer and narrow dell and in the extended distant plain the waters formed a fine lucid cres∣cent the canal being then happily touched by the sun's beams the heights cloathed with oaks the lower hills girt with plantations of various hues the bold rocks pushing forth their fronts from out the wood all mingled with that irregularity and wildness nature alone can display in these hilly countries formed this beautiful landskip  Here was one of the first houses of the Carmelites or White Friars in England who were

extant  Hulne  was the first monastery of Carmelite Friars in this kingdom The account of its foundation is thus given by ancient writers Among the British Barons who went to the Holy Wars in the reign of King Henry III were William de Vesey Lord of Alnwick and Richard Gray two eminent chieftains in the christian army led by curiosity or devotion they went to visit the Monks of Mount Carmel and there unexpectedly found a country∣man of their own one Ralph Fresborn a Northumberlandman who had distinguished himself in a former crusade and in conse∣quence of a vow had afterwards taken upon him the monastic pro∣fession in that solitude When Vesey and Gray returned to England they strongly importuned the superior of the Carmelites to let their countryman accompany them home which was at length granted upon condition that they would found a monastery for Carmelites in their own country Soon after their return Fresborn mindful of their engagement began to look out for a place for their Convent After examining all the circumjacent solitudes he at length fixed upon the present spot induced it is said by the great resemblance which the adjoining hill bore to Mount Carmel and indeed whoever looks into Maundril's travels will find that the draught of that mountain given in his book bears a strong likeness to this be∣fore us  The above William de Vesey gave a grant of the ground con∣sisting of twelve or thirteen acres in his park of Holne but Fres∣born is said to have erected the building himself The foundation was laid about A D and Fresborn gathering a proper number of Monks became the first Abbot of the Order and having pre∣sided here with great reputation of sanctity at length died and was buried in the monastery about the year  The original grant of William de Vesey was confirmed by his successors Veseys and by the Percies after their becoming proprietors of Alnwick many additional privileges and immunities were added by the succeeding grants particularised in Mr Grose's work but too  tedious to take place except only such as are singularly curious fol∣lowing  Also all wild bees with their fruits of honey and wax found in Walse and in Holne as well in the park as in the forest for the per∣petual support of the light in their church with a provision against the said Friars being defrauded of the said bees wax and honey by the foresters and shepherds there They shall also have yearly out of the Lord's coney warren of Houghton one truss of conies at Easter and another at the assumption of the blessed Mary And certain quantities of rushes and twelve loads of broom to cover their houses  Henry Percy th Earl of Northumberland built in this abbey a fine tower as a place of refuge for the Monks to retire to in times of danger Near it is this curious inscription in ancient English  I  n the year of Crist Ihu mccccxxVIII  This Towr was bilded by Sir hen Percy  The fourth Earl of Northūberlād of gret hon̄ worth  That Espoused Maud y  e  good Lady

given by Tanner Some of the buildings are fitted up and inhabited by servants who take care of an aviary which his Grace has established here The other parts are decorated with plantations of various trees and shrubs so as to afford a delightful point of view from every station whence they are visible  This Convent at the dissolution says Fuller was at low rates in a cheap country valued at l s per annum but justifies our observation that even Mendicant Friars had houses endowed with revenues  Fuller's Ch Hist p  Robert Lesbury born in Northumberland the d and last Provincial of the Carmelite Order chosen was buried at West Chester  Randal's Manuscripts  From an ancient survey which Mr Grose copies made in it appears  that the cloister is square in the midst thereof groweth a

society  Returning from  Hulne  by the same road we passed down to  ALNWICK ABBEY  now the seat of  Michael Doubleday  Esq    This was formerly an  Abbey  of Premonstratensian Canons Dugdale calls it a Priory dedicated to St James and the blessed Virgin It was founded in by  Eustace Fitz John  who by his marriage with  Beatrix  the daughter of  Ivo de Vesey  became Lord of the barony of Alnwick He endowed it amply  The village of  Hincliff  with its demesnes and wastes with the service of half the tenants Two parts of the tythes of the Lordship of  Tughall  of  Alnham Heysend  and  Chatton  One moiety of the tythes of  Wooler  of  Long Houghton  and  Lesbury  He annexed to it the  Priory and Church of Gysnes  near  Felton  dedicated to St Wilfred to hold in pure alms with all its privi∣leges and endowments a moiety of the tythes and two bovats of land at  Gyson  the church of  Halgh or Haugh  the lands of  Ridley and Morewick Hough  the liberty of erecting a  Corn Mill  on the river  Coquet  and of raising as much Corn on his wastes there as they could plough with liberty to grind it at his own mill mulcture free He also gave the Canons for their table the  tenth part of all the  enison and pork killed in his parks and forests  and  of all the fish taken in his fishery by his order  and a salt work at  Warkworth  William de Vesey his son gave them advowsons of  Chatton Chillingham and Alnham  They also held the advowsons and appropriations of  St Dunstans in Fleetstreet London  and of  Sckenfield in Yorkshire  They had acres of Turbary and liberty of pasturage on  Edlingham  Common Lands at  Chatton  and  Falloden  Also four Tenements and a Garden in  Newcastle upon Tyne  Grose and Wallis  The charter of foundation included in a confirmatory charter of Henry Percy Earl of Northumberland is addressed to  William de Sta Barbara  Bishop of Durham Among the souls for whose benefit it was erected is mentioned that of  Ivo de Vesci  Dugdale and Stephens do not agree touching the time when this order of Religious came first into England From Dugdale's authority it is said that the first of that order came to settle at Alnwick in the year but Stephens from the authority of Raynerus says the order first came over in and settled at Newhouse in Lincolnshire in their monastery built by Peter de Saulia dedicated to St Martialis  In the chronicle of this house preserved in the library of King's Col∣lege Cambridge there is an account of  a Banquet  given by  Walter de Hepescotes  the Abbot A D on the day of the assumption of the blessed Virgin Mary to  Henry the  th  Lord of Alnwick  with the fol∣lowing Knights  William de Acon Richard Tempest Walter Blount Allan de Heton John Coniers John Heron John Littleburum Thomas de Ilderton Thomas de Boynton Ingram de Umfravil John de Dichaunt John de Swyn∣ton Radulphus de Viners  and many others of the chief gentry of the country amounting to all entertained in the refectory beside at a second repast The cloisters too were filled with inferior people of all ages to the number of who were likewise there feasted  Grose  It appears from the same authority that divers of the Percys were in∣terred here particularly  Henry the second Lord of Alnwick  who died in  Henry the third Lord  who bestowed on the Monks l at his death A D also  Mary  his wife daughter of the Earl of Lancas∣ter  Henry the

title by purchase from the Brandlings This is a sweet though deep retirement on the banks of Aln defended by lofty hills to the north and west  ALNWICK ABBEY GATEWAY  depiction of Alnwick Abbey gateway  There are no remains of the  Abbey  but a  Gateway and Tower  which by the architecture and arms sculptured upon the building shew it is of much more modern date than the foundation of the house This tower is not square but oblong having an exploratory turret on each corner The north side is ornamented with a nich canopy'd capable of receiving a statue five feet high most probable it contained the effi∣gies of the dedicatory Virgin Beneath is a figure of an angel in relief with expanded wings Over this entrance are shields of arms a cross supposed to be the arms of the Veseys and a cross molin On the south side in a nich is the figure of one of the Religious of the order of White Friars of Premonstratenses in his proper habilament in pretty good preservation This front is ornamented with shields of arms the arms of Brabant adopted by the Percys with the arms of Lucys quar∣terly the principal and also the arms of Vesey  A gate opens to the east on each side of which are the figures of cherubs supporting armorial shields on this front is also a canopy and nich for a statue Here are the arms of Brabant and the arms of Lucys on separate shields At this entrance as also on the north side were machicolations and in the center of the arching of the gateway is a square aperture from whence the possessors could annoy assailants The masonry of this tower is excellent the gates of lattice braced with iron still remain  Above the gate going into the court of the house is an escutcheon of white marble much injured by the weather but retaining some marks of the Sculptor to distinguish that it once contained the crest of the Doubledays an arm in armour suspending a mullet The antiquity of this piece has been much doubted but the materials determine that point clearly  This seat of  the Doubleday family  has nothing very singular to mark it but the beauty of the retirement under the hanging woods of the river Aln The ground plot of the religious house is now included in the orchard the ruins of which probably afforded materials for the pre∣sent mansion but there are not the least remains to denote the exact scite of the monastic buildings or the place of interment of the illustri∣ous personages before mentioned  Solemn situations like this and the ruins of religious houses always affect my mind with a degree of languishment Such a seclusion such a retirement would have filled my wish The life of the Ecclesiastic is most desirable and seems calculated to be the happiest No natural tendency to indolence and ease prompts this determination but the se∣renity of a Churchman's life under the entire preclusion of all worldly concerns affords that tranquillity of mind so necessary to contemplation and study to philosophic researches and divine meditationwithout the poison of ambition some minds can enjoy a mediocrity with con∣tentwithout an impertinent wish to intermeddle with public affairs some men can sit within the little mansion busied only in pious duties and contemplations and amidst domestic peace living each day in gratitude for the enjoyment of the rural beauties of some sylvan scene the plain the mead the grotto and the streamcall it luxury but the busy world incessantly rolls the heavy wheels of care too near my thresholdI am frequently induced to adopt Horace's description  WARKWORTH CASTLE  depiction of Warkworth Castle  Agricolam laudat juris legumque peritus  Sub Galli cantum Consultor ubi Ostia pulsat  And a thousand times am induced to follow his precept  Rebus omissis  Atria servantem postico falle clientem  We passed from  Alnwick Abbey  to  WARKWORTH  the roads agreeable and the country finely cultivated In the way we had a view of the port of  ALEMOUTH  This was a dependent manor of the barony of Alnwick The town is small but carries on a considerable trade in the export of corn and other produce of the country The imports are chiefly timber and some merchandize from Holland Near the sea on an eminence are the remains of a church in the form of a cross When this edifice was de∣stroyed or by whom is not known The churchyard is still used for sepulture  In the banks as washed away by the violence of the sea have frequently been discovered Bones of an enormous size Ignorant spectators have retained the circumstance without dis∣tinguishing of what animals these were the remains and being found near a place of human interment they are at once conceived to have belonged to men of gigantick stature The con∣stant warfare that distressed these shores for ages might occasion the slaughter of vast numbers of horses and other beasts which after a day of havock may have been thrown into one com∣mon pit The remains of elephants have been discovered in several parts of England and have given the like apprehension to the vulgar that giants once distressed this island  We approached the town of Warkworth by a fine stone bridge of three arches over the river  Coquet  anciently defended by a tower with an iron gate and portcullis  THE CASTLE OF WARKWORTH  stands on a lofty eminence the town of  Warkworth  lying on the nor∣thern inclination of the hill and forming a pleasing though steep ap∣proach to the castle the street is wide and contains some modern buildings This access gives the fortress an august appearance  Werkworthe Castell stondythe on the southe syde of Coquet watar It is well maynteyned and is large It longed to the Erle of Northomberland It stondithe on a highe hille the which for the more parte is includyd with the ryver and is about a mile from these Ther is a prety towne and at the towne ende is a stone bridge with a towne on it Beyond the bridge is Banborowshire  Lel Itin v p  An account of this place published in the Newcastle Courant in the year contains the following particulars  It is about three quar∣ters of a mile from the sea The principal street stands upon a rising ground at the higher end of which upon an eminence are the re∣mains of an ancient castle The market place is in the middle of the town where is a fine stone cross on a spacious area at the meeting of two streets the one leading to the church which is an elegant struc∣ture whose spire is upwards feet high the other to the bridge where is an ancient tower Contiguous to the bridge is a large free∣stone quarry the stones of which are so much esteemed that great quantities thereof are shipped for London The salmon fishery here is carried to a very great extent so that at the mouth of the Coquet in the summer season as well as in the river itself are some thousands caught which gives employment to a number of hands The river which almost surrounds the town directs its course in a straight line for about half a mile then leaving the fine and pleasant villas of Glosterhill and Amble on its southern banks while it loses itself in the ocean In the year it left its old course and forced its way between two sandy hills overgrown with bent that had ob∣structed its passage for ages and is now settled in a very deep channel with a fine clay bottom which makes it navigable for small craft It is said there is upwards of feet of water upon the bar at full sea and continues that depth very near the town so that with a little assistance of art it might be made to admit ships of a consi∣derable burthen and as Coquet Island is situated a little to the south∣ward forms a fine bay at the very mouth of the river The grounds adjoining thereto abound with a fine seam of coal and so plentiful is corn that few counties can equal its fertility From these consi∣derations what pity it is that Warkworth was not made a seaport since nature has almost half finished the design  This little borough is governed by a Mayor who is chosen annually at a Court Leet and enjoys great privileges by an extensive common the property of the village and some little indulgencies from his Grace the Duke of Northumberland and as the town consists all of free burgesses is capable of great improvements  John Fitz Robert in King Henry III obtained licence that the market which had been usually kept upon the  Sunday  at his manor of Werkworth should be held upon the Wednesday every week  Dugd Baron v p  The castle stands on the crown of a rock of an oblong figure the great tower to the north placed on the brink of the cliff above the town is of fine architecture in chiselwork of a singular figure being octangular and from the center of four opposite sides a turret projects of a semihexagonal form from the middle of the building a very lofty exploratory turret arises This part of the castle owes its origin to the  Percys  as appears by the  Lion of Brabant  above the gate and the arms dispersed over the building The western side is formed of various irregular towers and walling of different ages extending along the brink of the cliff whose foot is washed by the river  Coquet  On the south the ground rises gradually to the height of the rocks on which the western buildings are founded This side of the castle fronts to a spacious plain or platform and is defended by a high wall with an outward moat The ancient gateway and chief entrance to the castle is on this side the gate defended by circular towers and a draw bridge The eastern side is placed on the brink of a steep declivity defended by an outward moat and a lofty wall guarded by a square bastion near the center and an angular tower at the south point The walls enclose a spacious area almost square within which the ancient parts of the fortress are very ruinous  The view from hence is so extensive and various that description can carry but a very imperfect idea of its members or its beauties to the east and northeast there is a sea prospect with which you take in all the shore we had traversed with  Dunstanbrough  and  Bambrough Castles  at the most distant point of land the  Farn Islands  lie scattered like patches on the face of the waters The port of  Alemouth  is a nearer object and at a little distance the mouth of the river  Coquet  and  Coquet Island  with its ruined monastery are seen To the north you view a rich cultivated country to  Alnwick  westward the banks of  Coquet  river graced with little woodlands which here and there impend on its winding channel to the south you view an extensive plain in∣clining towards the sea crowded with villages and interspersed with woods the shore indented by many little ports and creeks the higher grounds are scattered over with innumerable hamlets churches and other buildings mingling with a variety highly pleasing whilst on the extreme distance the different teints of the landskip arising from va∣rious objects require colours to convey their picture to the mind  Mr Grose who has given two views of this castle in his excellent work says  nothing can be more magnificent and picturesque from  what part soever it is viewed and though when entire it was far from being destitute of strength yet its appearance does not excite the idea of one of those rugged fortresses destined solely for war whose gloomy towers suggest to the imagination only dungeons chains and executions but rather that of such an ancient hospitable mansion as is alluded to by Milton  Where throngs of Knights and Barons bold  In weeds of peace high triumphs hold  The castle and mote according to an ancient survey contained acres ¾ perches of ground Its walls on the south east and west sides are garnished with towers The great gate of the castle is on the south side between two polygonal towers and is also defended with ma∣chicolations  The keep or dungeon forms the north front its figure is a square with the angles canted off Near the middle of each face of this square there is a turret projecting at right angles its end terminating in a semihexagon these projections are of the same height as the rest of the keep This keep is very large and lofty and contains a variety of magnificent apartments  Mr Grose gives the copy of a survey taken of this castle in of which some extracts may be pertinent here  The Buyldinge of the sayd castell on the sowth parte is thre towres viz the Gatehouse towre in the middle thereof which ys the entrye at a draw bridge over drye moyte and in the same toure ys a prison and porter lodge and over the same a fare lodging called the constables lodgings and in the curtayne is a fayre and comely building a chapel and divers houses of office and above the great chambre and the Lordes lodginge On the west side the posterne towre and the old hall which was very fare at the entrye into the hall for the porche thereof is raysed a little square towre wherein is two chambres and on the foresyd in stone portrayed a lyon verie workmanly wrought and therefore called the lyon towre In the easte syde of the great hall was an ile set owt with pyllers which yet standeth The doungion is in the northe parte of the scyte of the sayd Castell set upon a little mount highyer than the rest of the cowrte steppes of a greas before ye enter to yt and the same ys buyld as a foure square and owt of every square one towre all which be so quar∣terly  squared together that in the syght every parte appeareth five towres very finely wrought of masonwork and in the same con∣teyned as well a fayre hall kytchinge and all other houses of offices verie fare and apteley placed as also great chambre chapel and lodgings for the Lord and his trayn The castell is envyroned on thre partes with the sayd ryver and of the northe parte in an an∣gle within the sayd water is situate a towne called the borough of Warkworth and the parish church c  Warkworth  was formerly the  barony  of  Roger Fitz Richard  who held it by the service of one Knight's fee of the grant of King Henry II He married  Eleanor  one of the daughters and coheiresses of  Henry de Essex  Baron of  Raleigh and Clavering  The name of Clavering is derived from the barony of Clavering in Essex  By the testa de Nevill it appears that Robert the son of Roger held of the King in capite by the service of one Knight's fee the barony of Warkworth with its appurtenances And Roger the son of Richard held the same barony by like service from the time of King Henry the father of King John who gave it to him in fee  John de Clavering was summoned to parliamant as Baron Warkworth and Clavering th King Edward I d King Edward III and the th King Edward III  It continued in this family for several successive generations John in obedience to King Edward I by his command took upon him the surname of  Clavering  In consi∣deration of certain grants of lands in the southern counties he made over to King Edward II the reversion in fee of his  barony  and  castle  of  Warkworth  And also Rothbury Corbridge and Newburn which by a reversionary grant to Henry Lord Percy now are become part of the possessions of his Grace the Duke of Northumberland  provided he should die without issue male This reversion King Edward III granted to  Henry Lord Percy  from whom these pos∣sessions have descended to the present  Duke of Northumberland  The church is a handsome building ornamented with a spire the inside very neat There is a monument with the recumbent effigy of a Knight Templar with an inscription intimating that the personage there interred was  Sir Hugh de Morwick  who gave the common to the town of  Warkworth  In a window of one of the ailes is painted the figures of  St Hilda  and an attendant female  Leland says  Warkworth  was much resorted to by Merchants At present there is no navigation on the Coquet though it is said to be practicable to bring up small craft to the bridge The town is entitled  to a weekly market on Thursday and three annual fairs on the Thurs∣days preceding St George's St Lawrence's and St Martin's days  We passed up the river Coquet about three quarters of a mile to the  HERMITAGE at WARKWORTH  depiction of Warkworth Hermitage  HERMITAGE  The approach is kept in neat order but still retains its original form a narrow walk on the brink of the river which at this place flows without any troubled current leads to the door of the Hermitage  The Poem of the Hermit of Warkworth to which I shall have frequent occasion to resort in the following description opens thus  Dark was the night and wild the storm  And loud the torrents roar  And loud the sea was heard to dash  Against the distant shore  Musing on man's weak hapless state  The lonely Hermit lay  When lo he heard a female voice  Lament in sore dismay  With hospitable haste he rose  And wak'd his sleeping fire  And snatching up a lighted brand  Forth hied the reverend fire  This short extract will shew the Poet's mode of introductions he then leads on the personages to whom the Hermit relates his tale  Ah seldom had their host I ween  Beheld so sweet a pair  The youth was tall with manly bloom  She slender soft and fair  * * * * * *  First tell me father said the youth  Nor blame mine eager tongue  What town is here what lands are these  And to what Lord belong  Alas my son the Hermit said  Why do I live to say  The rightful Lord of these domains  Is banished far away  Ten winters now have shed their snows  On this my lowly hall  Since valiant Hotspur so the north  Our youthful Lord did call  Against fourth Henry Bolingbrook  Led up his northern powers  And stoutly fighting lost his life  Near proud Salopia's towers  One son he left a lovely boy  His country's hope and heir  And oh to save him from his foes  It was his grandsire's care  In Scotland safe he plac'd the child  Beyond the reach of strife  Nor long before the brave old Earl  At Bramham lost his life  And now the Percy name so long  Our northern pride and boast  Lies hid alas beneath a cloud  Their honours rest and lost  No chieftain of that noble house  Now leads our youth to arms  The bordering Scots despoil our fields  And ravage all our farms  Their halls and castles once so fair  Now moulder in decay  Proud strangers now usurp their lands  And bear their wealth away  Not far from hence where yon full stream  Runs winding down the Lea  Fair Warkworth lifts her lofty towers  And overlooks the sea  The towers alas now stand forlorn  With noisome weads oerspread  Where feasted Lords and courtly dames  And where the poor were fed  Meantime far off mid Scottish hills  The Percy lives unknown  On strangers bounty he depends  And may not claim his own  O might I with these aged eyes  But live to see him here  The should my soul depart in bliss  He said and dropt a tear  And is the Percy still so lov'd  Of all his friends and thee  Then bless me father said the youth  For I thy guest am he  Silent he gaz'd then turn'd aside  To wipe the tears he shed  And lifting up his hands and eyes  Pour'd blessings on his head  * * * * * *  But who may this young lady be  That is so wond'rous fair  * * * * * *  Then up and down in hunters garb  I wander'd as in chase  'Till in the noble Nevill's house  Raby Castle  I gain'd a hunter's place  Some time with him I liv'd unknown  Till I'd the hap so rare  To please this young and gentle dame  That Baron's daughter fair  * * * * * *  This evening as the night drew on  Fearing we were pursu'd  We turn'd adown the right hand path  And gain'd this lonely wood  Then lighting from our weary steeds  To shun the pelting shower  We met thy kind conducting hand  And reach'd this friendly bower  lofty perpendicular rocks on the other hand confining the walk to about the width of four feet From the summit of the cliffs a grove  of oaks is suspended giving a solemn shade and at their feet issues a spring of the purest water which formerly supplied the Recluse The steps vestibule and chief apartments of the Hermitage are hewn out of the bosom of a freestone rock whose outside face is about feet high embowered with stately trees which impend from the top of the preci∣pice and fissures of the cliffs One lower and outward apartment is of masonry We entered into this lower apartment by a passage of three paces the doorway marked with the remains of bolts and iron hinges it is built up against the side of the rock about feet square and ap∣pears to have been the kitchen or principal dwelling having a range or fireplace six feet wide On the south side of this apartment opposite to our entrance is a doorway leading to an outward seat formed in the rock and opening upon the walk on the river's brink On this side  of the room are two windows which bear the marks of irongrating and also a closet By holes cut in the rock it seems as if timbers had been lodged therein for the flooring of an upper chamber This struc∣ture is built of ashlerwork and appeared to us of much more modern date than the cells formed in the rock Passing from this outward build∣ing the way we entered we ascended by steps to a little vestibule with a seat on each side capable of holding one person only Above the inner doorway some letters appear the remains of a phrase which may be thus rendered in English  "My tears have been my food day and night"  From thence we entered the principal apartment or  chapel  about feet in length and not more than seven feet and an half wide and of the same height Two pilasters of semihexagonal form project from the opposite walls in the center and one from each corner from whence spring the intersecting groins of the roof the joinings ornamented with roses The pilasters have plain capitals and bases in the old Gothic stile All the work is chiselled and done with mechanic ex∣actness and regularity the wall or outside rock as you enter is left so thick as to admit the vestibule before described At the east end is an altar formed cross the whole apartment ascended by two steps the upper plane edged with a moulding In the center of the wall behind is a nich for a crucifix or image with the remains of a glory On the  right hand as you approach the altar cut out of the thickness of the wall is a nich or cavity like those often described in the progress of this work left in the walls of the ailes of churches within which there is represented a table monument no chink or cavity appearing to give a supposition that it is hollowed to receive any human remains with a recumbent female figure  Mr Wallis's description is in the following words  In the fole of a window at the south end of the altar is the effigies of the blessed Virgin sculptured in stone recumbent another of the child Jesus on her right hand standing his left rested upon her shoulder at her feet in a nich in the wall is the effigies of an Hermit in the attitude of prayer  Mr Wallis is in an error here for the female recumbent figure having its head towards the east lays with the right hand to the chapel if any figure has stood on the side of the effigies it must have been against the pillar which divides the windows There is an absurdity in the idea of  the boy Jesus standing over the tomb of the Virgin Mary  that need not be dwelt upon  the hands and arms of which appear to have been elivated Light is admitted by two small windows behind On the pillar which divides the windows are the remains of some sculpture supposed by many to be that of an hovering cherub but with the utmost attention and a strong desire to coincide with others I could not see any such figure even with an eye prejudiced by such prepossessions  And now attended by their host  The hermitage they view'd  Deep hewn within a craggy cliff  And overhung with wood  And near a flight of shapely steps  All cut with nicest skill  And piercing thro' a stony arch  Ran winding up the hill  There deck'd with many a flower and herb  His little garden stands  With fruitful trees in shady rows  All planted by his hands  Then scoop'd within the solid rock  Three sacred vaults he shews  The chief a chapel neatly arch'd  On branching columns rose  Each proper ornament was there  That should a chapel grace  The latice for confession fram'd  And holy water vase  O'er either door a sacred text  Invites to godly fear  And in a little 'scutcheon hung  The cross and crown and spear  Up to the altar's ample breadth  Two easy steps ascend  And near a glimmering solemn light  Two wellwrought windows lend  Beside the altar rose a tomb  All in the living stone  On which a young and beauteous maid  In goodly sculpture shone  A kneeling angel fairly carv'd  Lean'd hovering o'er her breast  A weeping warrior at her feet  And near to these her crest  This is a bull's head the crest of the Widdrington family All the figures c here described are still visible only somewhat effaced with length of time  if it has ever been the representation of any figure and now wasted by the weather beating through the windows I con∣ceive it was that of a child standing in a weeping attitude over the re∣cumbent effigies At the foot of the recumbent effigies is a bason cut  for holy water and the feet of the effigies rest against an animal most likely a dog as an emblem of fidelity as is usual on monuments of the like form I pay great deference to the opinions of other visitants but cannot agree with the author of the poem that this is a bull's head or the usual place for crests on the contrary according to the virtues of the deceased ancient tombs are decorated with an animal at the foot of the effigies as a lion for fortitude a dog for fidelity c and this same figure appeared to me no other than that of a crouching dog as is to be seen on multitudes of ancient tombs The usual place of the crest on tombs is under the head of the effigies The examples in the northern counties are most likely to point out to us the prevailing fashion The bull's head is in that position on the tombs of the family of Nevils in Brancepeth and Staindrop churches in the county of Dur∣ham and a dog lays at the feet The same on the fine tomb of Ogle in Bothal church and also the Ram's head on the elegant tomb of Gray at Chillingham with many other instances in Northumberland Under the head of the effigies no crest appears a double cushion is the support By length of time and the weather beating through the windows the figures are greatly injured In a nich at the foot of the monument and cut in the wall is the figure of an Hermit on his knees resting his head on his right hand and his left hand placed on his bosom as in a lamenting or pensive posture The author of the poem has racked invention to conceive a cause for our Hermit's vow of severity and retirement  The cliff the vault but chief the tomb  Attract the wand'ring pair  Eager they ask what hapless dame  Lies sculptur'd here so fair  The Hermit sigh'd the Hermit wept  For sorrow scarce could speak  At length he wip'd the trickling tears  That all bedew'd his cheek  Alas my children human life  Is but a vale of woe  And very mournful is the tale  Which you so fain would know  Young Lord thy grandsire had a friend  In days of youthful fame  Yon distant hills were his domains  Sir Bertram  From the advertisement to the Poem  About a mile from the castle in a deep romantic valley are the remains of a hermitage of which the chapel is still entire This is hollowed with great elegance in a cliff near the river as are also two adjoining apartments which probably served for the sacristy and vestry or were appropriated to some other sacred uses for the former of these which runs parallel with the chapel appears to have had an alter in it at which mass was occasionly celebrated as well as in the chapel itself  Each of these apartments is extremely small for that which was the principal chapel does not in length exceed feet nor is more than ½ feet in breadth and height it is however very beautifully designed and executed in the solid rock and has all the decorations of a com∣pleat Gothic church or cathedral in miniature  But what principally distinguishes the chapel is a small tomb or monument on the south side of the altar on the top of which lies a female figure extended in the manner that effigies are usually exhibited praying on ancient tombs This figure which is very delicately designed some have ignorantly called an image of the Virgin Mary though it has not the least resem∣blance to the manner in which she is represented in the Romish churches who is usually erect as the object of adoration and never in a prostrate or recumbent posture Indeed the real image of the blessed Virgin probably stood in a small nich still visible behind the altar whereas the figure of a bull's head which is rudely carved at this lady's feet the usual place for the crest in old monuments plainly proves her to have been a very different personage  About the tomb are several other figures which as well as the principal one above men∣tioned are cut in the natural rock in the same manner as the little chapel itself with all its ornaments and the two adjoining apartments What slight traditions are scattered through the country concerning the origin and foundation of this hermitage tomb c are delivered to the reader in the following rhimes  It is universally agreed that the founder was one of the Bertram family which had once considerable possessions in Northumberland and were anciently Lords of Bothal castle situate about ten miles from Warkworth He has been thought to be the same Bertram that endowed Brinkburn Priory and built Brenkshaw chapel which both stand in the same winding valley higher up the river  But Brinkburn Priory was founded in the reign of King Henry I whereas the form of the Gothick windows in this chapel especially of those near the altar is found rather to resemble the stile of architecture that prevailed about the reign of King Edward III and indeed that the sculpture in this chapel cannot be much older appears from the crest which is placed at the lady's feet on the tomb for Camden informs us that armorial crests did not become here∣ditary till about the reign of King Edward II  was his name  Where e'er the noble Percy fought  His friend was at his side  And many a skirmish with the Scots  Their early valour try'd  Fair Widdrington the maiden's name  Yon tow'r's her dwellingplace  Her sire an old Northumbrian chief  Devoted to thy race  Many a Lord and many a Knight  To this fair damsel came  But Bertram was her only choice  For him she felt a flame  Lord Percy pleaded for his friend  Her father soon consents  None but the beauteous maid herself  His wishes now prevents  * * * * * * * *  When lo a damsel young and fair  Stepp'd forward thro' the hall  She Bertram courteously addrest  And kneeling on her knee  Sir Knight the Lady of thy love  Hath sent this gift to thee  Then forth she drew a glittering helm  Well plated many a fold  The casque was wrought of temper'd steel  The crest of burnish'd gold  Sir Knight thy Lady sends thee this  And yields to be thy bride  When thou hast prov'd this maiden gift  Where sharpest blows are try'd  Young Bertram took the shining helm  And thrice he kiss'd the same  Trust me I'll prove this precious casque  With deeds of noblest fame  Lord Percy and his Barons bold  Then fix'd upon a day  To scour the Marches late opprest  And Scottish wrongs repay  * * * * * * * *  Now closing fast on every side  They hem Sir Bertram round  But dauntless he repels their rage  And deals forth many a wound  The vigour of his single arm  Had well nigh won the field  When ponderous fell a Scottish ax  And clove his lifted shield  Another blow his temples took  And reft his helm in twain  That beauteous helm his Lady's gift  His blood bedew'd the plain  Lord Percy saw his champion fall  Amid the unequal fight  And now my noble friends he said  Let's save this gallant Knight  Then rushing in with stretch'd out shield  He o'er the warrior hung  As some fierce eagle spreads her wing  To guard her callow young  * * * * * * * *  All pale extended on their shields  And welt'ring in his gore  Lord Percy's Knights their bleeding friend  To Wark's fair castle bore  * * * * * * * *  All day o'er moss and moor they rode  By many a lonely tow'r  And 'twas the dewfall of the night  Ere they drew near her bow'r  * * * * * * * *  Six days young Knight are past and gone  Since she set out to thee  And sure if no sad harm had happ'd  Long since thou wouldst her see  For when she heard thy grievous chance  She tore her hair and cry'd  Alas I've slain the comeliest Knight  All thro' my folly and pride  * * * * * * * *  Then mounted she her milkwhite steed  One morn at break of day  And two tall yeomen went with her  To guard her on the way  Sad terror smote Sir Bertram's heart  And grief o'erwhelm'd his mind  Trust me said he I ne'er will rest  Till I my Lady find  * * * * * * * *  Now brother we'll our ways divide  O'er Scottish hills to range  Do thou go north and I'll go west  And all our dress we'll change  * * * * * * * *  One day as he sate under a thorn  All sunk in deep despair  An aged Pilgrim pass'd him by  Who mark'd his face of care  * * * * * * * *  Cheer up my son perchance he said  Some tidings I may bear  For oft when human hopes have fail'd  Then heav'nly comfort's near  Behind yon hills so steep and high  Down in a lowly glen  There stands a castle fair and strong  Far from th' abode of men  As late I chanc'd to crave an alms  About this evening hour  Methought I heard a Lady's voice  Lamenting in the tower  * * * * * * *  These tidings caught Sir Bertram's ear  He thank'd him for his tale  And soon he hasted o'er the hills  And soon he reach'd the vale  * * * * * * * *  All day he sits beside the gate  And pipes both loud and clear  All night he watches round the walls  In hopes his love to hear  The first night as he silent watch'd  All at the midnight hour  He plainly heard his Lady's voice  Lamenting in the tower  The second night the moon shone clear  And gilt the spangled dew  He saw his Lady thro' the grate  But 'twas a transient view  The third night wearied out he slept  Till near the morning tide  When starting up he seiz'd his sword  And to the castle hey'd  When lo he saw a ladder of ropes  Depending from the wall  And o'er the moat was newly laid  A poplar strong and tall  And soon he saw his love descend  Wrapt in a tartan plaid  Assisted by a sturdy youth  In Highland garb then clad  Amaz'd confounded at the sight  He lay unseen and still  And soon he saw them cross the stream  And mount the neighbouring hill  Unknown unheard of all within  The youthful couple fly  But what can 'scape the lover's ken  Or shun his piercing eye  With silent step he follows close  Behind the flying pair  And saw her hang upon his arm  With fond familiar air  Thanks gentle youth she often said  My thanks thou well hast won  For me what wiles hast thou contriv'd  For me what dangers run  And ever shall my grateful heart  Thy services repay  Sir Bertram could not further hear  But cry'd Vile traitor stay  Vile traitor yield that Lady up  And quick his sword he drew  The stranger turn'd in sudden rage  And at Sir Bertram flew  With mortal hate their vigorous arms  Gave many a vengeful blow  But Bertram's stronger hand prevail'd  And laid the stranger low  Die traitor diea dreadful thrust  Attends each furious word  Ah then fair Isabel knew his voice  And rush'd beneath his sword  O stop she cry'd O stop thy arm  Thou dost thy brother slay  And here the Hermit paus'd and wept  His tongue no more could say  At length he cry'd Go lovely pair  How shall I tell the rest  Ere I could stop my piercing sword  It fell and stabb'd her breast  Wert thou thyself that hapless youth  Ah cruel fate they said  The Hermit wept and so did they  They sigh'dhe hung his head  * * * * * * *  My brother alas spake never more  His precious life was flown  She kindly strove to sooth my pain  Regardless of her own  * * * * * * *  Thus pouring comfort on my soul  Even with her latest breath  She gave one parting fond embrace  And clos'd her eyes in death  * * * * * * * *  For me I loath'd my wretched life  And long to end it thought  Till time and books and holy men  Had better counsels taught  They rais'd my heart to that pure source  Whence heav'nly comfort flows  She taught me to despise the world  And calmly bear its woes  No more the slave of human pride  Vain hope and sordid care  I meekly vow'd to spend my life  In penitence and pray'r  The bold Sir Bertram now no more  Impetuous haughty wild  But poor and humble Benedict  Now lowly patient mild  My lands I gave to feed the poor  And sacred altars raise  And here a lonely Anchorite  I came to end my days  This sweet sequester'd vale I chose  These rocks and hanging grove  For oft beside that murmuring stream  My love was wont to rove  My noble friend approv'd my choice  This bless'd retreat he gave  And here I carv'd her beauteous form  And scoop'd this hollow cave  Full fifty winters all forlorn  My life I've linger'd here  And daily o'er this sculptur'd Saint  I drop the pensive tear  In Mr Grose's account of this Hermitage it is alledged that it was universally believed the first Hermit enjoined himself this life of pennance and severity in contrition for the murder of his own brother I must say I was struck with an idea on my first entrance which grew upon me whilst I remained in these sacred vaults and drew on a train of pensive thoughts There needed nothing barbarous savage or mur∣derous to induce a man to such a lifedisappointed love was sufficient of itself to incite it Conceive the personage sculptured upon the tomb or monument to be the devoted bride or beloved wife of the Recluse cut off in the prime of life by some common casualty perhaps after a short life of harmony and love in the marriage state in the instant of bringing into the world the issue of an happy intercourse and the heir of an opulent racethis was cause sufficient Under such circum∣stances we should entertain more feelings for the tender sorrows and disappointed love of the Hermit than we can experience when we see him stained with bloody crimes arising from wrath revenge rashness or indiscretionmad with jealousy even to such a blindness that he could not know his own brother though gone forth in disguise at his instance on the same errand with himself I own my ideas furnished me with a very different picture of the Hermit's woesI stood over the monument with an eye flooded in tears and a mind distressed by the tenderest touches of commiseration After musing for some time I imagined I could hear the distressed inhabitant exclaim  In the dust rests for ever the beloved remains of the best of womenunited to me by love and wedlocthe hopes of my youth the joy of my de∣sire and the felicity of my possession with her I had flattered my mind life would pass away serenely and the evening of the human day advance in peace but alas when my happiness was at its height she was snatched from me and forlornness beset my steps  But to return to my description The west end of the chapel is lighted by a window formed of four conjoining circles above the inner door of the vestibule is a shield bearing the remains of some arms by some taken to be the figure of a gauntlet but as it is generally believed one of the Bertrams formed this hermitage so it is probable this shield the remains of which seem to correspond therewith bore the Bertrams' arms Or an orl azure  The Bertrams were an ancient family in this country they held great possessions under the savour of William the Conqueror with whom Sir Richard Bertram a Norman Knight came over to England He had in marriage as a royal ward Sibel the daughter and heiress of the Mitford family Sir William his son obtained his possessions of Mitford to be created a Barony by King Henry I He married Alice the daughter of Sir William Merley by whom he had issue two sons This Sir William was or Osbertus Colutarius under his grant the foun∣der of Brinkburn Priony afterwards described  On the left hand of the altar a window is formed in the partition of the apartments divided by two mullions the summit of each light or division ornamented with work formed of sections of circles like those seen in cathedrals of the tenth century From the chapel we en∣tered an inner apartment by a neat doorcase over which is sculptured a shield with the crucifixion and several instruments of torture At the east end of this inner apartment is an altar like that in the chapel lighted by the lastdescribed window and through which the person kneeling at the inner altar could view the cenotaph in the chapel this apartment is about five feet wide and nine paces in length here is also a nich or bason for holy water On the northern side of this inner chamber a recess is cut in the rock of size sufficient to hold the couch of a person of middling stature I have seen several of the like form alcoved above and a sole about two feet above the level of the floor to hold the matrass and bedding of the Recluse This recess is so placed that whilst I sat therein to make my notes by a nich cut slantwise in the partition wall which separates the two apartments I had a view of the cenotaph and effigies thereon The nich seemed calculated for this very purpose being cut through the wall assant it could not be conceived intended to convey the light By some it has been imagined to be de∣signed for confession but it is my sentiment that the Hermit was priest and penitent in one and that he had devised those apertures that the effigies should be constantly in his sight In this inner apartment is a small closet cut in the side wall to the north from this interior cham∣ber is a doorway leading to an open gallery having a prospect up the  river but by the falling of some of the rock above this part is greatly damaged It is said by old people that the roof was supported by a fine pillar and formed a small piazza cloister or open gallerysuch galleries are seen in very ancient mansions in the centre of the front one is yet perfect in the remains of Bradley Hall in the county of Dur∣ham the mansion of the eldest branch of the family of Bowes built as it is presumed soon after the conquest  From these cells through a neat doorway there are winding stairs cut in the rock leading to its summit supposed to conduct to the Hermit's olatory or garden A channel is ingeniously formed on the steps to carry off the water  It seems evident that the original hermitage consisted of no more than the apartments hewn in the rock the inner one being the dwellingplace and the little cloister the summer seat facing westward and commanding a beautiful view up the river Coquet which here forms a fine curve in extent near half a mile on this side bordered by rocks on the other by cultivated lands of an easy inclination on the extremity stands a pretty farmhold to terminate the sequestered rural prospect The style of architecture adopted in this hermitage is of the Saxon Go∣thic which proves its antiquity In the postscript to the  poem  of the Hermit of Warkworth the author asserts  that the memory of the first Hermit was held in such regard and veneration by the  Percy  fa∣mily that they afterwards maintained a chantry priest to reside in the hermitage and celebrate mass in the chapel whose allowance uncommonly liberal and munificent was continued down to the dis∣solution of the monasteries and then the whole salary together with the hermitage and all its dependencies reverted back to the family having never been endowed in mortmain On this account we have no record which fixes the date of the foundation or gives any parti∣cular account of the first Hermit  The patent is extant which was granted to the last Hermit in by the sixth Earl of Northumber∣land  Henry Earl of Northumberland c Knowe you that c Have geven graunted and

of the above patent it will perhaps be needless to caution the reader against a mistake some have fallen into of confounding the hermitage near Warkworth with a chantry founded within the town itself by Nicholas de Farnham Bishop of Durham in the reign of King Henry III who appropriated the church of Branxton for the maintenance there of two Benedictine Monks from Durham That small monastic foundation is indeed called a cell by Bishop Tanner but he must be very ignorant who supposes that by the word cell is necessary to be understood a hermitage whereas it was commonly applied to any small conventual establishment which was dependant on another As to the chapel belonging to this endowment of Bishop Farnham it is mentioned as in ruins in several old surveys of Queen Elizabeth's time and its scite not far from Warkworth church is still remembered  A Cell of two Benedictine Monks from Durham for whose maintenance here Nicholas de Farnham Bishop of Durham who died A D appropriated the church of Brankeston which was confirmed by Walter de Kirkham his successor  Vide Angl Sacr Tom p  Tanner  But that there was never more than one priest maintained at one and the same time within the hermitage is plainly proved if any further proof be wanting by the following extract from a survey of Warkworth made in the year viz Ther is in the parke also one howse hewyn within one cragge which is called the harmitage chapel in the same ther haith bene one preast keaped which did such godlye services as that tyme was used and celebrated The mantion howse ys nowe in decaye the closes that apperteined to the said chantrie is occupied to his Lordships use  It appears to me that the Monks who came here in an age in which the severities of a religious life were relaxing founded the good warm kitchen of masonwork at the foot of the rock adapted to indulgencies unknown to the original inhabitant The form of the doors and win∣dows are of a much more modern mode than those above the windows of the hermitage have had no irongrating  After wandering in this sweet sequestered vale so singularly calcu∣lated for contemplation and adapted to a mind fond of serious reflec∣tions till the decline of day warned us of the necessity of our depar∣ture we returned to Warkworth from whence we had a view of  COQUET ISLAND  little more than a mile from the main land and

ordnance  We took our rout to  FELTON  a village on the banks of  Coquet  The scenes near this place are ro∣mantic and beautiful fine rocks and hanging woods form the margin  of the winding river whilst on every side lies a rich cultivated coun∣try At this place the Barons of Northumberland Lord Eustace being one did homage to Alexander King of Scotland to chastise which de∣fection King John

almost entire the great tower is very perfect there are some remains of the dormitory now converted into a cellar Mr Grose observes that  these ruins exhibit one among the many in∣stances wherein circular and pointed arches occur in the same build∣ing and that in parts manifestly constructed at the same time which shews that about the period of its erection there was a kind of struggle between the ancient mode or Saxon and what is called Go∣thic architecture in which neither style then thoroughly prevailed The upper range of windows in this church are all circular those immediately under them are pointed Two doors one on the north the other on the south have circular arches of various members falling back supported on pilasters richly adorned with variety of Saxon ornaments particularly that on the north which has among others the heads of animals These are generally deemed the most ancient decorations of that style The great tower has four pointed arches and others of the same shape are supported by massy octa∣gonal pillars in the body of the church There have been burials here as late as the year At the east end and in the north and south crosses were chapels in one of which are divers fragments of coffins and human bones On the whole though this building ex∣cept about the doors is remarkably plain it has a sober and solemn majesty not always found in buildings more highly decorated Part of this perhaps it may owe to its romantic situation which is the most proper in the world for retirement and meditation Near the south∣west  angle of the church is a house seemingly built out of the offices of the monastery  There are no monuments or inscriptions that we could discover the whole of the little plain on this peninsula is occu∣pied by the church and the priory the latter now converted into a farmhouse and garden  This priory  was founded by Osbertus Colutarius under the grant of Sir William Bertram for Black Canons or Canons regular of St

road to visit it though greatly tempted by the agreeable descriptions given us of the walks of  Hartburn Wood  We arrived at  BOLHAM  a small village of some antiquity being the ancient residence of  Sir Walter de Bolham  to whom it was granted by King John from the Bolhams it came to the family of Raimes in the time of King Edward III and as appears by the escheats of the several reigns of King Richard II King Henry IV King Henry VI Queen Elizabeth and King Charles I remained in that family for many generations We inquired after a camp before described to us of an oblong figure yards long and broad fortified with a vallum and double trench having a raised pass leading to it It appears to be Roman  From the Manuscripts of  Roger Gale Esq  Extract of a Letter from  Mr John Warburton  to  Roger Gale  Esq  January  As I was well assured from the authority of  Mr Camden  for I want languages to derive words that  Clenoventa  was on the banks of the  Went  or  Wentsbeck  in  Northumberland  I carefully examined all places from its source 'till it falls into the sea that had the least appear∣ance of antiquity as likewise those upon the river  Glen Bowent  and  Alne  viz  Anterchester Yevrin  which is Bedes ad Gebrin  Milfield  Bede's Melmin  Brampton  where  Mr Camden  in his first edition of the Britannia placed  Bremenium  but could never satisfy myself until I dis∣covered the  Devils Causeway  and found  Thorntons  standing thereon which though at present but an inconsiderable village shews the Vestigia in it of a remarkable town in former times a high ridged military way runs through the middle of it and a square platform joins to it both which are evidently Roman  I had once made choice of  Bolham  for the ancient  Glanoventa  which is situated upon an emi∣nence opposite to  Thornton  on the other side of the  Wentsbeck  where there are likewise considerable remains of antiquity but on better consideration found that to have been of  the Saxons foundation  Why of  Saxon  foundation  Bolham  might have been the town of  Glenoventa  and  Th  rton  a  Tarris  or  Castelliam  to it  Thor  ton  by Mr Warbarton's map is at least two miles north from  Bolham  See note to Mr Warburton's letter of st Nov  R G  About two miles south of this  Thornton  close by the military way lately mentioned are  two large stones  stand∣ing on their end like those at  Burrowbridge  but not so big and betwixt them a tumulus which I was at the expence of opening and in it found a stone coffin about three feet in length two in breadth and two in depth which was black on the inside with smoke and had in it several lumps of glutinous matter which my workmen would needs have to be pieces of the dead hero's flesh It was covered over with two flat stones and not above a yard in depth from the summit of the  tumulus  but had neither inscription bones coins urns or other remarkable thing about it I opened another larger than this near  Chester in the Wood  and found it much the same  Bedal  th Jan      J Warburton  The Hermanstreet passes over Bolham Moor in many places perfectly to be distinguished  Near it is a tumulus which was opened by Mr John Warburton by which two pillars of stone are placed without any inscription the personage interred totally unknown On the northeast side of the moor is a rock trenched round containing the ruins of interior build∣ings but its history lost in the oblivion of ages Near  Bolham  is a place called  Gally Hill  the place of execution belonging to the ancient Barons Many places of that name are to be seen near the baronial castles in this county  We now took our rout by  MITFORD  to  Morpeth  The ancient castle of  Mitford  is a rude heap of ruins si∣tuate on a considerable natural eminence defended towards the north and west by a deep ditch and on the south the river  Wansbeck  washes the foot of the castle hill the works appear to cover about an acre of ground The principal part of this fortress consisted of  a circular tower  raised upon an artificial mount the chief elevation from the natural level being effected by arches of stone and vaults which in ancient times were used as prisons or places for concealment the tower was defended by an outward wall which ran parallel with it at the dis∣tance of about feet There is a very narrow prospect from this emi∣nence the vale is so shut in on every side What other erections were  within the walls of this fortress cannot be traced the ruins are so con∣fused and most of them covered with grass  It is presumed  this castle  was built before the conquest the first owner and its date are not known  At the time of the conquest it was the possession of  Sir John Mitford  whose only daughter and heir  Sibille  was given in marriage by the Conqueror to  Sir Richard Bertram  a Norman Knight by whom he had two sons William and Roger  William succeeded to the  manor  and  castle  of  Mitford  and by the grant of King Henry I it was created  a Baronage  He married  Alice  the daughter of  Sir William Merley  of  Morpeth  His son Roger desirous of adding greater improvements to  Mitford  paid a fine of marks to King Henry II for a weekly market at his town of Mitford  Roger Bertram  Sir Richard Bertram a Norman Knight  Sir William  Sir Roger  Sir William Ob th King John  Sir Roger Ob King Henry III  Roger  a lineal descendant having joined with the northern Barons in the th year of the reign of King John the Flemish troops commanded by that inhuman ravager in his northern depredations seized this castle and destroyed the town of  Mitford  with fire and sword  A little higher the river Wentsbeck falls into the sea It runs by Mitford which was burnt down by King John and his Rutars when they so miserably wasted this country that age called those foreign auxiliaries and freebooters  Rutars  who were brought out of the low countries and other places to King John's assistance by Falques de Brent and Walter Buc which  Rutarii  or  Ruptarii  are not only mentioned by our Historians in the reign of King John but before his time also in the reign of Henry II and after it under Henry III By all the accounts which we have of them it appears they were mercenary German troops Now in the High Dutch  Rot  whence our English  Rout  is a company of soldiers  Rotten  or  Rottiren  to muster That from hence we are to fetch the true original of the word we are sufficiently taught by Will Newbrigensis who lived and wrote his History in the times of these Rutars This was formerly the barony of William Bertram whose line soon failed in Roger his grand∣son the three coheirs being married to Norman Darcy I Penbury and William de Elmeley  Gibson's Camden  The next year probably whilst the castle remained in the King's cus∣tody it was besieged by Alexander King of Scotland as is mentioned in Leland's Collectanea from a chronicle called  Historia Aurea  Whe∣ther it was taken or not is not mentioned  The barony of  Mitford  was given by the Crown to  Philip de Ulcotes  but upon the King's demise  Bertram  found means to make his peace with King Henry III and for a fine of l obtained a restitution of his lands and afterwards grew into so much esteem with him that he granted on the payment of marks that his annual fair at  Mit∣ford  should last eight days instead of four  His successor  Roger Bertram  was one of the insurgents at  Northamp∣ton  in the reign of King Henry III where he was taken prisoner and his honour and castle of  Mitford  with all his other lands were seized for the King's use The castle was given by King Edward I to  Eleanor Stanour  the wife of  Robert de Stoteville  In the year  There be ruines of a Castle longynge to the Lord Borow at Mydford

was soon after poisoned at Gateshead by some of Middleton's confederates  and others and carried to London and there executed In the year it was taken by  Alexander King of Scotland  who disman∣tled it and spoiled most of its fortifications  The entire  barony of Mitford  was then the property of  Adomer de Va∣lence Earl of Pembroke  By the escheats of the th King Edward II it appears this castle was in ruins having been destroyed by the Scots  This Earl seemed to have a divine interdict impending over him and the immediate vindictive hand of Providence to be upon him and his posterity for his atrocious deeds He was a tool to his Prince and ser∣vilely  submitted to the mandates of the Crown contrary to the dictates of humanity honour and justice He sat in judgment on  Thomas Earl of Lancaster  and impiously acquiesced in his sentence He was a chief instrument in apprehending the famous Scotch patriot  Wallace of Craiggy  in accomplishing his capture by corrupting his bosom friends and by the treachery of his most intimate associates and those in whom he placed his utmost confidence  Sir John Monteith  and others of infamous memory  Adomer  on his bridal day was slain at a tourna∣ment held in honour of his nuptials and left a wife at once a  maiden bride and widow  She was so affected by the loss of her husband that she resigned herself entirely to a reli∣gious and contemplative life and bestowed most of her fortune in acts of piety and charity raising her faithful friends above want and indigence and erecting noble structures in honour of religion and learning with liberal endowments Denney Priory in Cambridgeshire for Nuns of the order of St Clare being of her foundation endowed with the manor of Stroud in Kent and other lands also Pembroke Hall in Cambridge mostly finished about the year and endowed with lands for a warden and fellows some of whom she lived to see preferred to the highest dignities in England in the course of years or upwards She died th March st of King Edward III and was interred in her own Priory of Denney under a marble mo∣nument between the two choirs of the Nuns and Seculars She survived her husband years  Wallis  It

was  an Hospital  at  Mitford  dedicated to St Leonard founded by Sir William Bertram who granted lands for founding Brinkburn Priory and endowed with lands for the maintenance of a Chaplain By an inquisition taken in the reign of King Edward III it appeared that the Abbot of  Newminster  had possessed himself of these lands but King Richard II obliged him to restore them and nominated John de Wenhings Chaplain There was an ancient bridge over the Wansbeck between the church and castle called  Fouse Brig  or  Fees Brig  for the guarding of which on the eve and day of the Ascension  Walter

the area and interior buildings It is placed on a lofty eminence unassisted by art the southern side is very steep and washed by the river Wansbeck the northern secured by a deep valley The tower has formerly had angular turrets at the northeast and southeast corners with a com∣munication by an open gallery which was supported by projecting cor∣bles there is no portcullis In the centre of the arched roof of the gateway is a square aperture calculated to annoy assailants who should gain the outward gate It commands a fine prospect overlooking the town of Morpeth and the banks of Wansbeck where large tracts of woodlands are beautifully disposed Near this tower towards the northeast and on the other side of the deep dell or valley before described is a round  mound of earth  on a natural mount whose height is greatly in∣creased by art It appears to have been raised rather by assailants than as an outwork or defence to the castle for from thence by engines stones and missile weapons might be thrown into the interior parts of the fortress to annoy the garrison and agreeable to the modes practised in early times perhaps this was cast up for an opposing fort and  mal∣voisin  on some blockade No record come to my knowledge proves who  was the first founder of this castle early in the time of the Normans the baronial seat of the Merleys was here and probably they had a stronghold upon the very eminence where the present remains stand the tower was the work of William Lord Greystock who lived in the time of King Edward III as appears by the escheats of that reign

each other the one denoting the hill and the other the valley at length the distinctions subsided in the general ap∣pellation of Morpeth  We do not find in history any thing singular of  Morpeth  in the times of the Saxons it was the ancient  barony  of the  Merleys  but when it was so created or whether the Merleys were in possession before the con∣quest there is no satisfactory evidence By the Testa de Nevill it ap∣pears that the third Roger de Merley held the barony of Morpeth by the service of four Knights fees  "Et omnes antecessores sui tenerunt per iundem servicium post conquestium

of the heiress of the Dacre family to Lord William Howard third son of the Duke of Norfolk from whom they descended to the present Lord Carlisle  We made an excursion from  Morpeth  to visit  BOTHALL  the  baronial inheritance  of the family of  Ogles  distant from  Morpeth  about four miles This ride is extremely beautiful lying within a little dis∣tance of the river Wansbeck the banks of which to the south are lofty and cloathed with fine hanging woods through which here and there you see a bold promontory or rocky precipice All the environs of the river to Bothal are romantic and beautiful The  castle  though placed on a considerable eminence yet stands in a very deep vale hanging woods forming an amphitheatre at the distance of about half a mile Its pre∣sent remains chiefly consist of the great gateway flanked on the north side by two polygonal towers feet high and on the southwest angle by a square turret whose height measures feet From the towers of this gate the outward wall extends along the brink of the eminence in  a circular form enclosing the area and interior buildings of the castle This enclosure contains about half an acre in which are some scattered fragments of the inner buildings now affording no degree of certainty what were their original form and use To the northwest of the gate∣way was formerly another tower pulled down within the memory of persons living which bore the denomination of Ogle's Tower The scite of this castle to the south is very lofty on the brink of a rock whose foot is washed by the river the east and west sides of the emi∣nence have been defended by a moat Mr Grose to his second plate of this castle which chiefly represents the gateway tower says  the wood scene in the back ground slopes to the water's edge here and there skirted by picturesque rocks and in many places the trees overhang the stream which here runs briskly breaking against the huge stones plentifully scattered throughout its channel at once cap∣tivating the eye and by its gentle murmurs sweetly soothing the ear Indeed the banks of the Wansbeck between this place and Morpeth afford a variety of sylvan scenes equal in beauty to any in the king∣dom  I must descend to more minute descriptions of the gateway with its towers  This gateway is of the same model as the gate of Alnwick castle and by its architecture and ornaments appears to be nearly of the same date  they bear a certain appearance of being the most modern parts of this castle the architecture is excellent and the edifice built of a durable stone well drest and in good preservation the ascent from the town is easy and gradual The outward gate was defended by a portcullis in the arching of the roof of the gateway are three square apertures from whence the garrison could annoy the assailants when they had gained the first gate a door on each hand leads to the flank∣ing towers On the right hand is a passage and staircase in the south∣west tower at the foot of the stairs is a door into the prison which is not so horrible an enclosure as most of those seen in baronial castles it is above ground and closely arched having narrow apertures like loop∣holes to admit light and air from the gateway passage Opposite to these stairs on the other side of the gateway is a large hall Passing the winding stairs we entered the stateroom above the gateway this apartment is lighted by four windows none of them of any consider∣able size the principal one is to the north in the centre by means of the thickness of the wall the recess formed for the window is benched  with stone at the sides with seats for six persons at least From this window you view the town the church and a narrow vale through which the river flows On each side of this window is a door leading to the chambers of the flanking towers The fireplace of a very spa∣cious range is to the east on the left side of which is another window with a recess benched like that before described A third window like the two former is to the right of the door as you enter looking into the area of the castle a large window to the west commands the wider part of the vale and the fine hanging woods by which it is is bounded Three large stones cover the apertures in the floor which open upon the passage of the gateway The upper rooms being more ruinous are not so easy to describe or their form capable of being as∣certained I walked these apartments with a veneration proceeding from the tenderest obligations an alliance with a lineal descendant of those illustrious families who for ages possessed this inheritance  In the front of the gateway are several shields of arms arranged in the following order which I apprehend like those at  Alnwick  perfectly point out to us the time when this part of the castle was built In the centre in a large shield are the arms of  England and France  quarterly It is observable that England takes the first quarter a thing I have never observed an instance of before On the dexter side a shield with the arms of  England three lions passant gardant  on the sinister a shield with the arms of the Grays  barry of six argent and azure three torteauxes in chiefe  This denotes that the erection was made in the time of Edward IV whose consort was a Gray mother of Thomas Gray who in the th year of that reign was created Marquis of Dorset Beneath in the  centre the arms of Bertram  Or an orl azure  On the dexter and sinister sides of this are three shields which denote the alliances of the Bertram family  The first on the dexter side the arms of Percy  The second of Dacre  The third of Vesey Or a cross sable  The first on the sinister side of Darcy  The second of Hastings  The third two lions passant gardant in a tressure but to what fa∣mily this coat armour appertains I cannot form any probable assertion  On the tower on the right hand of the gateway are four shields the chief of which is of the Ogles but as they are greatly defaced by time and on my view did not seem to have any material relation to the date or history of this erection I passed them without particular atten∣tion but on considering the matter I am induced to believe that John Ogle the grandson of the heiress of Bertram and who assumed the name of Bertram erected this gateway In the family of Ogles after∣wards mentioned he is particularly noticed  In the centre on the battlement is the figure of a man in stone in the attitude of sounding a horn on the right hand tower is another figure holding a ball between his hands these figures are greatly in∣jured by the weather  The following curious survey of this castle was published in the Antiquarian Repertory  The following extract is copied from a survey called the book of Bothool Baronrye in Nor∣thumberland most beautifully written and in high preservation the property of his Grace the Duke of Portland to whom that barony now belongs It was taken the th day of June by Cuthbert Carnable Robert Maddison and John Lawson tenants to that manor by virtue of a commission granted by Cuthbert Lord Ogle and directed to the aforenamed Cuth∣bert Carnabie Robert Maddison Jacob Ogle Esqrs Anthony Ratcliff and

of  Wansbeck  garrisoned by the first cohort of the  Morini  for it is seated in the range of the wall where the Notitia places it the river's name is  Wantsbeck  and  Glanoventa  in the Bri∣tish tongue signifieth THE SHORE OR BANKS OF VENTA Mr Grose has the following remarks on the  Bertrams  the original possessors of this  castle  Richard Bertram  who lived about the time of King Henry II gave two sheaves or two third parts of the tithes of this barony to the Monks of  Tinmouth  In Bourne's History of New∣castle it is said  being a devout man he gave two shares i e two third parts of the titles of it to the Monks    His son Robert obtained of King Richard I that his manor with its dependencies should be raised to  a barony  and it is mentioned as such in that an∣cient record remaining with the King's Remembrancer in the Ex∣chequer called Testa de Nevil from its being compiled by Jollan de Nevil who was a Justice Itinerant in the th and th years of King Henry III It contains the King's fees through the greatest part of England with inquisitions of lands escheated and serjeantries  This  barony  was held by Robert of the King in capite by the ser∣vice of three Knights fees as his ancestors had formerly held it the said lands being  de veteri feofmento  and paying yearly for the castle guard at  Newcastle upon Tyne  for  cornage  l s d  Robert was succeeded by his son Roger who procured a charter for free warren for all his demesne lands here and at Heburn in this county His heirs enjoyed the barony for some successions without making any additions to its grandeur but  Robert Bertram  being in the reign of King Edward III constituted Sheriff of Northumberland and Governor of  Newcastle upon Tyne  obtained a licence of that King to make a  castle

time only for soon after his father's death with armed men he took forcible possession of the castle under pre∣tence of its being his birthright but on complaint to parliament a writ was issued to the

property antecedent to their intermarriage with the heiress of  Bertram Humphrey Ogle  Esq  lived at  Ogle Castle  at the time of the conquest  William the Conqueror by his deed without date confirmed to Humphrey all the liber∣ties and royalties of his manor of Ogle in as ample a manner as any of his ancestors had en∣joyed the same before the time of the Normans  This family held the manor of Unthank with lands in Gilcroft and Raleigh for several ge∣nerations  Sir Robert Ogle  by marriage with  Helen  the daughter and heiress of  Sir Robert Bertram  in the reign of King Edward III became possessed of the  barony of Bothall  Sir Robert Bertram's Lady survived him and married John De Hatfield  Mr Wallis mentions the following personages which are unnoticed in a pedigree of the family in the author's possession made out at the herald's office  Sir Robert de Ogle who married Johanna the youngest daughter and coheiress of Sir Alan de Heton of Edlingham as by an inquisition taken King Richard II  Sir Robert de Ogle High Sheriff of Northumberland King Henry VI  The title of the first Lord Ogle he says was Baron Ogle of Ogle  There was issue of this marriage  Sir Robert Ogle  who

into a defensible state Newcastle and the castle and haven of Tyn∣mouth raised a regiment of men at his own charge he had a chief command at the battle of Bradford where the forces of Fairfax were routed he took pieces of cannon and many standards at the battle of Marston Moor he was at the head of his regiment where disdaining to ask quarter the Northumbrians sold their lives dear to the parliamentary troops  and being obliged to fly for re∣fuge to foreign parts his estates were put under sequestration and some of them sold he with six others were excepted from the general pardon At the restoration he was reinstated in his possessions and having an only daughter she married  John Hollis Duke of Newcastle  who in her right became possessed of  the castle of Bothall  He died by a fall from his horse A D leaving an only daughter who married  Edward Earl of Oxford and Mortimer  These possessions devolved on their only daughter and heiress  Lady Margaret Cavendish Herley  who married  his Grace William the late Duke of Portland  whose eldest son  now Duke of Portland  is the present proprietor  The parochial church  stands at a little distance from the castle in tablets on the wall in the old black letter are painted the genealogy of the  Ogles  Of whom there were seven Lords and thirty Knights This Genealogical Table begins with  Humphrey Ogle  of  Ogle Castle  at the time of the  Conquest  There is a fine marble tomb of one of the Ogles and his Lady with their effigies recumbent I presume the personages there represented are Sir Robert Ogle and his wife the Baroness Bertram His effigy is cloathed in a coat of mail the hands elevated about his neck a chain with a cross pendant on his bosom his hair cut over his forehead and round by his ears his head supported on his crest a bull's head his feet rested against a curled water dog Her effigy is dressed in a long robe which conceals her feet over her head and shoulders a mantle flowing back her hands elevated her head sup∣ported by a cushion tasselled at the corners kept by two  Esquires  in their proper habiliments each holding a tassel on the lap of her robe a small Italian greyhound A sword sheathed lies between these effigies At the head of the tomb in niches ornamented with tabernaclework are four Ecclesiastics their crowns shaven and with hands elevated at a corner an inclining shield supported on the dexter side by a lion col∣lared and chained and on the sinister side by a monkey chained by the waste The shield of arms is so singular that I have caused it to be engraved with the effigies  On the banks of  Wansbeck  near to  Bothall  are the ruins of an an∣cient chapel or oratory said to be dedicated to the blessed Virgin The situation is admirably calculated for meditation being in a shady so∣litude By the arms on the wall it appears to have been built by the family of Ogles The erection is all of wellwrought free stone its dimensions within eight yards in length and four in breadth the roof now gone to decay was arched with stone after a curious form as appears by its remains It is now grown over with trees which have struck their roots into the joints and chasms of the building  In passing to Ashington the family seat of the  Crows  we had a view of  SHIPWASH  where the Rectoryhouse stands appertaining to the parish of Bothall lately honoured by the residence of  the most excellent Prelate his Grace the Hon and Right Rev Dr Drummond late Lord Archbishop of York  He was the second son of the Right Hon George Hay Earl of Kinnoul and brother to the present whose illustrious ancestors are recorded for their virtues and military atchievements in the annals of their country He was a man of deep erudition an excellent pastor a steady loyalist and a statesman of unbiassed integrity He mixed affability with dig∣nity and at the same time he commanded reverence he was courteous In his archiepiscopal character he was rigid yet easy of access and as he was benevolent so was he slow of condemnation He constantly avoided the bustle of greatness and in his country retreat putting off the dignity of his office he was distinguished as a generous friend an inimitable parent and a gracious neighbour He was a student in Christ Church College Oxford and had the degree of Doctor in Divi∣nity th June He took the name and arms of Drummond as heir intail to his great grandfather William Drummond Viscount Strathallan He married Henrietta daughter of Peter Auriol  Esq  Mer∣chant of the city of London by whom he had issue three sons and two daughters He became Chaplain to King George II in August was installed Prebendary of Westminster th April and consecrated Bishop of St Asaph th April he was afterwards translated to Sarum and made Archbishop of York in in the same year he was made Lord High Almoner to the King and one of his Majesty's Most Hon Privy Council  The mother church it is said formerly stood here At a little dis∣tance lies the port of  CAMBOIS  at the mouth of the river  Wansbeck  a haven with two quays on the north shore for small vessels about tons burthen employed in the export of corn and grindstones and in importing timber  The principal proprietors are Sir Thomas Clavering Bart and Matthew Ridley Esq  Many lime boats from the adjacent coasts resort to this place The cliffs by the sea called the  Hawk's Hugh  are rude and majestic There is a cavern towards the north end well known to smugglers The situation of  ASHINGTON  and the prospect from thence are delightful the banks of  Wansbeck  are finely wooded and on every hand you look upon a rich cultivated country The objects disposed on these scenes are various and beauti∣ful the nearer are woodlands rocks and cultivated eminences scat∣tered over with hamlets the streams of  Wansbeck  enlivened by people employed in the  Salmon Fishery  and graced with the bridge of  Ship∣wash  and the fishing vessels the more distant are Bebside and the port of  Cambois Seaton Delaval  and the sea  Ashington  was one of the dependent manors of the  barony  of  Bothall  Near this place is a spring called St Margaret's well but without any medicinal qualities Its name derived from days of superstition when for every trifle places and things were beatified by the churchmen  Approaching the sea coast we viewed  NEWBIGGIN  a fine bay for shipping secured from the stormy quarters by high rocky promontories and capable of receiving vessels of tons burthen The town is small and chiefly inhabited by fishermen There are several granaries for corn here This whole coast is enlivened by trade and opulence is dispensed on every side by the hand of industry Human nature is capable of vast works the capacity of man is infinite the further it is exerted the more is discovered for the advancement of its occupation The more our faculties are employed the nearer we ap∣proach to a similarity of the divine being in whose image man was created  in the beginning To let our time elapse whilst our rational powers sleep in indolence is highly criminal it is a prodigality of all others the worst denying birth to those good works we owe to ourselves and to mankind at large In the bay ships ride in six or seven fathom of water  The church stands on the north side of the haven on a point of land which projects a considerable way into the sea and it is said there are the remains of a pier there This church was formerly a much more considerable edifice now the middle aile and steeple with a spire only remaining which circumstances give rise to an idea that New∣biggin and its haven were in some former age of more considerable im∣portance The spire is a mark to Seamen of great use to ships coming from the North and Baltic Seas as a direction for their southward course The ornament of the altar seems to have been a devoted gift by some Seaman who had escaped the perils of the ocean being the King's arms carved in wood for the sternpiece of a ship  We passed the house of  CRESWELL  one of the ancient members of the  barony of Bywell  the family seat of  Creswells  from the time of King John  Robert de Cresswell King John  Simon King Henry

place engaged our attention seated on an eminence commanding a view of  Coquet Island  and the sea  Since the Author's tour this fine mansion was destroyed by fire said to be occasioned by the negligence of workmen  This was the ancient seat of the  Widdringtons  and by the attainder of  William Lord Widdrington  in came to the Crown Royal mercy being extended to him he did not suffer death with  Lord Derwent water  and his associates but was divested of his honours and estates  We find by ancient records that  Gerard de Widdrington  Gerard de Widdrington st King Edward I  Sir Roger th

William Lord Widdrington his son On his attainder his effects were computed at l  Henry his son His seat at Stella on Tyne  Wallis  was settled here in the reign of King Edward I and his descendants continued in  possession till the degradation of the family at the abovementioned period  We advanced westward to  CAWSEY PARK  a member of the barony of  Bothall  and the inheritance of a younger branch of the noble family of  Ogle  now the seat of  Bernard Shaw  Esq  by his marrying the widow of  William Ogle  Esq  This was the man∣sion of  John Ogle  who appears to have erected it as the old tower still retains the initial letters of his name  The date thereon  His wife was interred in Bothall church and her tomb has the following inscription  Here lyeth Catharine the wife of John Ogle  of Cawsey Park Esqr daughter of  Robert Woodrington Esqr by  Margaret his wife which Margaret was sister to  Robert the th and Cothbert the th Lord Ogle  She died May d  James their son was interred

collateral branches of the noble family of Ogle whose pedigrees would not be esteemed sufficiently pertinent to hold a place in this work  Henry Ogle  brother of the late  William Ogle  founded a School here for children and endowed it with a small piece of ground and l in money for a stipend for the master  Humphrey of this line of the family of Ogles was Dean of Hereford and one of the Society of Brazen Nose College Oxford where he founded two Scholarships in favour of the heirs of his brother Roger  The house has no great beauty of situation it is surrounded with a cultivated country and has pleasant gardens fishponds and other artificial ornaments which greatly contribute to make it a pleasant retirement  LONGHORSLEY  This manor was given by  Gospatrick Earl of Dunbar  to  Sir Ralph Merley Baron of Morpeth  as part of the dowery of  Julian  his daughter  Roger de Merley  granted part of these possessions to  Adam de Plesis  and the heirs of his body in the reign of King Henry III The family of  Horsleys  held lands within this manor from distant ages  John de Horsley King Edward III  Richard King Edward III High Sheriff  John King Henry VI  Sir John King Edward VI knighted after the victory at Musselburgh  Cuthbert Queen Mary Representative in Parliament for Northum∣berland and for the borough of Morpeth d and d same reign  Edward Horsley Widdrington whose only daughter and heir married Thomas Riddell  Esq  of Swinburn Castle  Wallis  The church stands at a distance from the town and belonged to the priory of  Brinkburn  Mr Wallis says that the Lord of this manor compelled all the tenants within the manor to keep the ways and ditches round their grounds in good order  on pain of being whipped  the day after his court was held As his authority for this strange penalty he quotes the Autographo Perantiquo  Et iste est Rogerus qui subditos suos in Horsley ad vias et fossatas circa Campos de Horsley bene conservandas et diligenter sustentandas tractare statuit Et quod quicunque convictus fuerit de aliquo fragmento in fossatis vel viis praedictis in Campo suo tenetur ibidem in crastino inventionis sanctae crucis et crastino sancti Martini in hieme  et reddet domino suo  pro quolibet  delicto suo  duas  Virgas serveas  quoties inde convictus fuerit  I conceive Mr Wallis has mistranscribed the word  serveas  how he renders the sentence to make it imply such a penalty as he has stated even allowing the word  serveas  to be right I know not The  Virga serrea  was a royal standard measure kept in the Exchequer and it is most probable the penalty inflicted on the tenants of Horsley was a forfeiture meeted by the  Virga ferrea  In our return to  Morpeth  our resting place from these little excur∣sions we viewed  COCKLE PARK TOWER  which stands about four miles north from  Morpeth  In the time of King Edward I it was the mansionhouse of a branch of the family of  Bertrams  built according to the fashion of most of the ancient capital dwellings in this county as a stronghold not only for the family but a place of security for the tenants with their flocks and herds at the times of incursions of the Scots or ravages by the banditti called the Moss Troopers  From  Morpeth  our next tour was by Whalton to Ogle Castle  WHALTON  was the barony of  Walter Fitz William  who came into England with the Conqueror It was afterwards the possession of  Robert de Cramma∣ville  whom King John divested and afterwards gave his estates toge∣ther with  Warkworth  to Roger Fitz Roger an ancester of the noble family of  Clavering  It afterwards came to the family of Scroops of Masham  Sir Henry le Scrope King Edward III  Sir Stephen King Richard II  Sir Henry King Henry IV  Sir John King Henry V  Sir Thomas King Henry VI  Wallis  in the reign of King Edward III and continued therein till the reign of King Henry VI  OGLE CASTLE  was the manor and seat of the family of  Ogles  before the conquest as I have mentioned before it is now part of the possessions of  his Grace the Duke of Portland  having attained  the barony of Bothall  in the de∣scent from  Cuthbert  the th Lord Ogle The situation is good on an eminence on the south banks of  Blyth  There are very little remains of the old castle part of a circular tower adjoins to the east of the present farm house which stands on the scite of the castle the windows of this tower are very small topped with pointed arches the whole remains carrying a countenance of very remote antiquity The ground wherein the chief part of the castle has stood is square guarded by a double moat divided by a breastwork of masonwork The walls are quite levelled with the ground and the moat almost grown up  Mr Wallis says that it appears by an ancient pedigree at  Bothall Castle  transcribed by Robert Treswell Somerset Herald A D by permission of Cuthbert Lord Ogle that  Walter Fitz William  came into England with the Conqueror to whom the King gave the barony of  Whalton  and that Walter by deed granted to  Humphrey de Ogle  all such lands and liberties as he or any of his predecessors had before the coming of the Normans notwithstanding the royal grant of  Whalton  and any claims he might make there under  In the reign of King Henry III and King Edward I  Thomas de Ogle  was possessed of  Ogle Castle  as appears by several escheats  Sir Robert Ogle  in the time of King Edward III resided here before his marriage with the heiress of the  Bertram  family By patent he held the bailiwick of the dominion of Tynedale He had licence from the Crown to  re∣build the Castle of Ogle  In he attended the King in the camp of  Stanhope Park  in he was at the battle of  Nevil's Cross  in he was Governor of  the castle of Berwick  during the siege in which his brother  Alexander  was slain  From Ogle Castle you command a pretty view of Belsey Castle  We passed by  KIRKLEY  a dependent manor on the ancient barony of Mitford for some ages past the seat of a branch of the noble family of  Ogle  now the possession of  Dr Newton Ogle  Prebendary of Durham and nephew to Admiral Ogle The mansion house makes a handsome appearance being a square build∣ing with flanks or wings consisting of offices The south front com∣mands no remarkable prospect the country irregular and not in the highest cultivation without any picturesque scene or ornamental ob∣ject but this is amply compensated by the view to the east which is extensive and affords a landskip equal to any in this part of the county  Kirkley  was anciently the seat of the  Eures  or  Evers  who held great possessions in the county of Durham and had their castle at  Witton  They held this manor by the service of presenting a barbed arrow on St John Baptist's day at the court of the castle of  Mitford  John de Eureaiding the Scots against King Edward II His lands after his death then in possession of Sir John his son were seized to the use of the crown  Sir John doth not appear to have had

converted into beautiful plantations but the great advancement which has taken place here is almost incredible and the noble works which now fill a tract of land that was covered with heath and had all the dreary aspect of barren∣ness and waste are astonishing No man is more valuable to the com∣monwealth than he who applies his opulence in the improvements of agriculture the produce of our lands is a staple of which we cannot be robbed by foreign enemies a treasure which no change in the ba∣lance of Europe can waste an intestine wealth which will give power without the jeopardies attending common merchandize the increase will ever find an efflux to states which cannot support their numbers by the produce of their own land and will ever secure an influx of wealth Our lands afford a perpetual supply of trade the goods derived from manual occupations are the objects of fluctuating taste and when Birmingham and Wolverhampton shall no longer bear the laborious anvil our wool our corn and cattle will remain a lasting source of wealth Manual occupations are transferrable and in future ages may and will be moved from their present seats and take place in other kingdoms and distant quarters of the earth but the produce of lands as they are local so are they universally necessary those of our climate in particular others produce the luxuries we seek but ours the

very particular pedigree of this Gentleman's ancestors entered in Sir William Dugdale's Visitation of Northumberland which commences at the time of the Norman conquest Sir Henrick Delaval second son of Guido Lord of Delaval carried one of the head banners when his cousin William Duke of Normandy conquered England  Robertus  Comes de  Moreton  vel de  Mortaign  frater uterinus  Willielmi

the mother's side to King William I  Hugh Delaval is mentioned in  Dugdale's Baronage  thus "Of this name I find mention in King Stephen  William Maltravers  then paying marks of silver and C £ to be disposed of as the King should think fit for the widow of  Hugh Delaval  with her lands for the term of years and after that time for her marriage and dowery  Guy Delaval is next mentioned by  Dugdale  King Henry II who then possessed  Navesby  in Com Northamp and held Knights fees as it seems for in Henry II upon collection of the aid for marrying the King's daughter it appears that he paid marks viz s d for each In Richard I upon levying the scutage of Wales he paid l for his fees in Yorkshire and upon the aid for the King's redemption in Richard I answered l in the same county s d in Com

Foresta  granted by King John at  Running Mead  confirmed by the Roman Pontiff  After this I find mention of  Gilbert Delaval  which  Gilbert  in Joh was in arms against that King All that I have further seen of him is that he held  Calverdon  in Com Northumb of the King in capite by barony performing the service of two Knights  as his ancestors had done from the time of the conquest  Dugd Baron  Eustace Delaval is thus mentioned by  Dugdale  c  At this time also  Eustace Delaval  held another barony in Com Northum consisting of these Lordships scil Black∣aliddon  Seton  with its

 Hugh Delaval married  Maud  the daughter of  Hugh de Bolbec  and died without issue  Dug∣dale  says  I come to  Hugh Delaval  who in Ed I had to wife  Maud  one of the cousins and coheirs of  Richard de Montfichet  daughter and heir of  Hugh de Bulbec  which  Hugh de Bulbec  also wedded  Margerie  one of the sisters and heirs to the said  Richard  In Ed I this  Hugh Delaval  with other of the great men of that time had summons to fit himself with horse and arms and be at  Portsmouth  on the st day of September thence to attend the King into  France  but further I cannot say of him  Eustace Delaval was heir and successor of  Hugh  but how near in blood my author doth not point out  Robert Delaval married  Margaret  daughter of  William Lord Greystock  William Delaval King Edward III High

his mother's side also who was a grand daughter of  Sir Thomas Hussey  of Doddington in the county of Lincoln which noble house and estate belong to him  In the north front  This princely mansion is built after  Sir John Vanburgh's  plan  of this magnificent structure consisting of five stories the whole of which is built of beautiful stone and of the most excellent masonry there is a flight of steps on each side of the up∣permost landing there are three superb doric columns which by their bold projectures give an extraordinary effect to their richly embellished entablatures immediately over these are placed handsome vases on pe∣destals here the attic story rises having a grand pediment with a tri∣angular tympanum in which the arms of the family and various tro∣phies are carved and so relieved that all their parts are perfectly seen free from its entablature This facade is rendered extremely beautiful by the breaks and fine proportions of its parts and by the excellent sculpture with which it is dressed and the whole is crowned with a ballustrade and proper pedestals on which urns are placed at each end hereof are seen the upper external parts of the grand staircases rising nearly to the height of the apex of the central pediment which afford a very graceful effect being ornamented with a series of round ballusters terminated by pedestals out of which arise in form of urns the tops of chimneys The perron to the portal has two landing places the upper of which is of the height of the basement story constructed boldly in bossagework serving as a basis for the edifice and giving an appear∣ance of great strength to it On each side hereof a corridor unites to the house two noble wings adorned with beautiful arcades extending along the whole length of the fronts These as well as the body of the house are all covered with lead their perfect unity therewith their  SEATON DELAVAL  South Front  depiction of Seaton Delaval  graceful projections niches and pediments form a most grand and pleasing court being terminated with two beautiful pavilions con∣nected also by a corridor The first room which you enter is a most stately hall feet long and feet high here all the ornaments strike by simple but grand uniformity Numerous arches recesses and niches please the informed observer more with the harmony of their proportions than with the splendour of their decorations The floor is of a black and white marble and the chimneypiece finely adapted to the great stile of the room the figures which support it are exquisitely executed as are the basso relievos and all the decorations opposite to the door is a grand music gallery faced with elegant iron ballustrades upon a fine entablature and supported by beautiful consoles in the uppermost niches are statues as large as the life admirably executed by the best Italian Artists with their attitudes and symbols representing Music Painting Geography Sculpture Architecture and Astronomy and in the interstitial solids are the pictures at full length of Sir John and Lady Hussey Delaval and their children The ceiling is extremely elegant to the right and left passages paved with marble leading through lofty arches to handsome rooms wainscotted with mahogany in which are the pictures of  Admiral Delaval  and others of Sir John's ancestors by Sir Godfrey Kneller and other good portrait painters and also to the two grand winding geometrical stone staircases feet in diameter reaching from the bottom to the top of the house of a structure which has been greatly admired by all who have seen them having iron ballusters of a very light and elegant form The hall leads to a splendid saloon front∣ing the pleasure grounds feet long and from the door at which you enter it to the folding glass doors on the opposite side thereof it is feet wide these open into a most magnificent portico of the Ionic order tetrastite of which the columns are three feet diameter In this room there are eight majestic fluted Corinthian columns of the most beau∣tiful stone and the same number of pilasters which divide it into three spaces the ceiling was executed by the famous Italian artist Vercelli and is exquisitely modelled and admirably coloured here are several finely painted whole length pictures of this family At the east end is a small antichamber which leads into a spacious drawingroom and also into a lesser drawingroom contiguous to an an elegant eatingroom beautifully ornamented with festoons of fruit and flowers formed of a most durable composition and so admirably painted as perfectly to re∣semble nature Collateral to these stately apartments are others for re∣tirement and waitingrooms connected with a stone winding staircase  of fine workmanship being ten feet three inches in diameter and com∣municating with the great staircase at every landingplace through either of which you may ascend to a grand gallery on the next floor on each side whereof are several large and finely proportioned bedchambers and from whence you may pass into new rooms lately built by Sir John among which are several stately bedchambers and dressingrooms and he has also highly ornamented the greatest part of this fine mansion with new and rich furniture Most of the best rooms have marble chimneypieces of admirable workmanship All the offices in the base story which are very numerous are arched with hewed stone from whence you may go on the same level to the east and west wings in the former thereof are the noble stables the chief of which is feet long and wide and feet inches high the roof being supported by three superb arches feet inches high the divisions of all the stalls and the niches for the hay are of stone In this wing there is a gallery extending the whole length of its front and several commo∣dious rooms The other wing contains a spacious and lofty kitchen and offices of all kinds on the ground floor and in the second floor se∣veral good apartments and a gallery also reaching along the whole length of it This splendid seat stands in part of the pleasure grounds surrounded by a haha having a wall of hewn stone nine feet high and considerably more than a mile in circumference which is not seen from the house Here are several walks disposed with great taste some of which are shaded as well by lofty old trees as plantations through which various vistas are cut some of them being terminated by elegant stone buildings and others opening delightful prospects to the sea towards the east greatly heightened by ships which are frequently sailing in sight of the windows to the south there is a fine view over a verdant lawn to another bay of the sea where frequently sail of colliers may be seen and enriched with the fine ruin of Tynemouth Priory a grand obelisk and several villages and hamlets interspersed forming a very beautiful landskip to the west there is an avenue of a mile and quarter long and to the north a view of a great part of Northum∣berland extending over a space of miles terminated by the august mountains of Cheviot This house stands within a few yards of the place where  Delaval Castle  the ancient baronial seat of the family for∣merly stood Near the house is  the family chapel  In this chapel are two tombs with recumbent effigies the one a Knight in armour who had made the crusade the other a Lady but there is no inscription to denote the personages they represent  of Saxon antiquity  HARTLEY HAVEN  depiction of Hartley Haven  MAUSOLEUM at Seaton Delaval  depiction of mausoleum  where divine service is constantly performed not far from thence there is an elegant  Mausoleum  which has lately been built by Sir John and Lady Hussey Delaval  to the memory of their late son  who was the delight not only of his parents but of all who knew him his endowments were so pleasing and his manners so captivating that the most able panegyrist would want words to give an adequate idea of this  most admirable young man  No expence has been spared in this pious edifice which has been justly admired by every one who has seen it the perron to the entrance being of the height of the zocle of the building serves as a continual pedestal to it the portico is of the doric order tetrastite the columns of which are each formed of one single stone weighing several tons bearing a handsome pediment with a triangular tympanum the dres∣sing of the whole is elegant and simple a cupola covered with lead rising majestically in the centre produces a very solemn appearance the inside is of the form of a chapel having a nave in the middle with an altar or communion table above which a solemn dome is sup∣ported by semicircular arches opening to an aile on each side in which are several arches and niches for the reception of tablets inscriptions and monuments underneath are catacombs strongly arched and of most durable workmanship they are all founded as is the whole of this structure upon a rock and as all the stones of which it is com∣posed are large and set so close together as not to admit of any wall falling it is calculated to last as long as the work of man can do it is enclosed by a haha wall of feet high and feet thick so wrought and put together as to have a rocky appearance giving the idea of long duration and by forming from its rudeness a strong con∣trast to the building which is all polished as well as stone can be pro∣duces an admirable effect  A delightful shady walk of a mile long leads to Sir John's port of  Hartley  In a periodical publication printed for Snagg in Fleetstreet I find the following ac∣count  Cullicoats  a place otherwise of no great distinction but worthy remembrance in this respect that it is a very commodious little port of artificial construction or as the common people stile it an harbour made by hand It is dry at low water and difficult at the entrance but it serves for coals and salt belonging to the works of particular persons at whose expence it was constructed  Seaton Sluice  was originally of the same kind Sir Ralph Delaval was continually contriving new improvements in the exercise of which he never hesitated at expence and amongst the rest made this port on his own plan and entirely at his own charge for the benefit of his tenants and himself immediately but with∣out excluding others who chose to use it In the construction of this small harbour he found enough to exercise his skill and patience the stone pier which covered it from the north east wind being carried away by the sea more than once and when he had overcome this diffi∣culty by using timber as well as stone he felt a new inconvenience by his port's filling up with mud and sand though a pretty sharp rill ran through it which had so hollowed the rock as to produce the very bason which Sir Ralph would convert into a haven In order to remove this mischief he placed a new strong sluice with floodgates upon his brook and these being shut by the coming in of the Tyde the back water collected itself into a body and forcing a passage at the ebb carried all before it and twice in hours scoured the bed of the haven clean King Charles II who had a great taste for matters of this kind made him collector and surveyor of his own port  whence his coals well known in London by that name are  shipped There are also large salt works and copperas works and like∣wise very considerable glass works which were built by Thomas Delaval  Esq  and purchased of him by Sir John who has cut through a solid and hard rock a new entrance into his harbour which is feet deep feet broad and feet long this great work he did at his own private expence which no person has any share or concern in but him∣self no ships come hither except for his coals salt glass and copperas the three lastmentioned works are carried on here for the sake of con∣suming the small coals of his colliery which would without them be of no value Before this new entrance was effected the opportunity for exportation here was very confined as the ships for want of a suf∣ficient depth of water in the old entrance were obliged to be loaded with keels whereas they can now sail out with their full loadings These works produce to the public  a revenue of above    l a year  and afford Sir John the means of constantly supporting several hundred people who live upon his estate in honest industry in which he and Lady Hussey Delaval take great delight  Sir John has also made a little harbour of refuge in  St Mary's Island  for the safety of the Fishermen upon this coast by which many have been saved who could not possibly in certain winds have reached any other harbour  Conceiving it might prove most agreeable to the reader to find a particular description of  FORD CASTLE  which Sir John Hussey Delaval considers as his sporting seat imme∣diately succeeding that of the princely mansion of  Seaton Delaval  I re∣served it for this place  From  Yevering Bell  and the eminences beyond  Wooler  it has a noble appearance arising from a fine cultivated plain  This Castle  was reedified by Sir John the antique stile being well preserved in the design two towers one on the east flank and one on the west being the only remains of the old castle which are retained in this edifice The work was begun in the year and compleated in two or three years The front is to the south the centre of which is formed by a semi∣hexagonal projection and its terminations are square turrets from whence on each hand a regular wing is advanced On the west side of the area in front is an old square tower of singular form it being composed of two turrets one arising above another the upper one being so much less than that which supports it as to afford a spacious battlement The area is enclosed by a wall embrazured and garnished with turrets the entrance to which is by a spacious gateway the wall is defended by corner towers  This castle is seated on the east banks of the river Till It appears by Madox's Exch p that  Sir William Heron  built it in the th year of the reign of King Henry III A D the estate having come to his family by an intermarriage with the heiress of  Ford  who derived her descent from  Odonel de Ford  as is mentioned in the pre∣ceding page and who was seized thereof in the time of King Henry I  The castle commands a fine prospect up the valley as far as Wooler bounded by lofty eminences which rising swiftly are broken in the most agreeable and romantic manner To the westward at about the distance of a mile and a half you view  Flodden Hill  marked to the eye by a rising plantation of firs  Made by Sir John Hussey Delaval  which crowns the eminence and gives a beautiful object upon the landskip In great floods the Till over∣flows several hundreds of acres of flat ground the extensive sheet of water makes a grand appearance from the castle when it subsides the plain is left covered with a most fertilizing mud by which the soil is greatly enriched  From the happy taste her Ladyship possesses for a rural life Sir John has advanced the more rapidly in those works of improvement which  mark the adjacent country The fair example becomes illustrious by the contrast which is seen in the lives of persons of equal rank and opulence The works which are spread around  Ford  and  Seaton Delaval  whilst they dispense felicity to innumerable laborious families contri∣bute greatly to the general opulence of the state No panegyric can pay due praise to those who thus employ their abundant wealth the effect is not contracted within the circle of Sir John's possessions the example influences as it carries with it conviction and many are thereby induced to cultivate and improve the adjacent estates recovering from a prepossession of ages of ignorance that the nature of the soil and cli∣mate would frustrate their attempts A vast tract of land on which you look from  Ford  was within years last past one continued sheepwalk now intersected and enclosed with excellent quickwood fences the eminences adorned with fine plantations the large and open farms which heretofore gave the country the aspect of poverty and desolation are now subdivided and let out into smaller allotments from l to l a year each by which the country has become well peopled and the lands which for pasturage did not yield above one shilling per acre now let for twentyfive shillings The vice of enlarg∣ing farms destroying villages and thereby depopulating a country was advanced to such enormity in the reigns of King Henry VII and King Henry VIII that it called for a parliamentary inquiry and restric∣tion No language can more strongly express the error than the pre∣amble of the statute of the th of King Henry VIII cha  For as much as divers and sundry persons of the King's subjects of this realm to whom God of his goodness hath disposed great plenty and abundance of moveable substance now of late within few years have daily studied practised and invented ways and means how they might accumulate and gather together into few hands as well great multitude of farms as great plenty of cattle and in especial sheep putting such lands as they can get to pasture and not to tillage whereby they have not only pulled down churches and towns and enhanced the old rates of the rents of the possessions of this realm or else brought it to such excessive fines that no poor man is able to meddle with it but also have raised and enhanced the prices of corn cattle wool pigs geese hens chickens eggs and such other almost double above the prices which have been accustomed by reason whereof a marvelous multitude and number of the people of this realm be not able to provide meat drink and cloaths necessary for themselves their wives and children but be so discouraged with  The FORGE near FORD CASTLE  depiction of forge  misery and poverty that they fall daily to theft robbery and other inconveniences or pitifully die for hunger and cold And as it is thought by the King's most humble and loving subjects that one of the greatest occasions that moveth and provoketh those greedy and covetous people so to accumulate and keep in their hands such great portions and parts of the grounds and lands of this realm from the occupying of the poor husbandmen and so to use it in pasture and not in tillage is only the great profit that cometh of sheep which now be come to a few persons hands of this realm in respect of the whole number of the King's subjects that some have some some some some and some more and some less by the which a good sheep for victual that was accustomed to be sold for s d or s at the most now sold for s or s or s at the least and a stone of clothing wool that in some shires of this realm was accustomed to be sold for d or d now sold for s or s d at the least and in some counties where it hath been sold for s d or s d or s at the most is now sold for s or s d at the least and so are raised in every part of this realm Which things thus used be principally to the high displeasure of Almighty God to the decay of the hospitality of this realm to the diminish∣ing of the King's people and to the let of the clothmaking whereby many poor people have been accustomed to be set on work and in conclusion if remedy be not found it may turn to the utter destruc∣tion and desolation of this realm which God defend  By this law which is still subsisting no farmer under a penalty to be levied by Justices of the Peace should hold more than  two farms  and they to be in one parish where he should reside and no farmer to have above sheep  Not only the pleasure her Ladyship takes in promoting Sir John's at∣tention to the improvements of the adjacent lands she also I am in∣formed was a chief cause of the  Iron Manufactory  carried on near  Ford  being brought to its present significance About a mile down the river a  PlatingForge  was erected in where a large quantity of shovels spades and other plateiron works are made as well for home con∣sumption as for exportation at the ports of Berwick Newcastle c The scheme when carried to its intended extent will be of great con∣sequence to this part of the country The situation of the  Forge  is ro∣mantic and the whole scene picturesque The water to supply the wheels is collected by a dam and forms a fine canal from whence it  breaks over the wear in a beautiful cascade and being intercepted in its lower course by rocks and hillocks divides itself into several streams The buildings for the forge as you look up the river lay to the left on the opposite side is a watercornmill the vale seen above the canal consists of cultivated and enclosed grounds which are highly contrasted by the lofty eminences which bound the prospect finely broken and irregular through which the light streams and gives a singular beauty to the offscape these at the extreme point of view are overlooked by Cheviot awfully supreme and majestic on whose brow heavy vapours are generally seen suspended  The family of Delaval had considerable possessions in  ECHEWICK  Hubert Delaval and Richolda his mother gave a moiety of that manor to the priory of Hexham The priory held lands there of the gift of others one parcel the donation of Thomas de Echewick and another of Peter de Fawdon The abbey of Newminster also had lands in Eche∣wick by the gift of John de Mitford King Henry VI  Roger Fenwick  Esq  of Bitchfield second son of Sir John Fenwick of Wallington by Margery the daughter and heiress of John Harbottle  Esq  married Ursilla daughter of Sir John Heron of Chipchase Knt and purchased of the Crown Echewick Hall with divers lands to be held by fealty only as of the manor of East Greenwich subject to a certain feefarm rent In the year he settled the same on Anthony his second son whose issue in the male line becoming extinct the estate about the year came to Ralph Scourfield  Esq  of Newcastle upon Tyne in right of his mother who was the daughter of Geo Fenwick of Newcastle Merchant Adventurer younger son of Anthony Fenwick Ralph Scourfield of Echewick  Esq  his only son was High Sheriff for the county of Northumberland A D he died Sept and lies buried within the rails of the communion table in the church of St John Newcastle On his decease the estate descended to Edward Bell  Esq  whose eldest daughter and coheiress the present proprietor in the year married George Spearman  Esq  This family of Spearmans derives descent from Le Sire D'Asperemont son of the Count D'Asperemont who accompanied King William the  Conqueror to England The corruption of the name has been attri∣buted by some of the family to an atchievement in the holy wars under Prince Edward afterwards King Edward I The ancestors of George Spearman  Esq  were settled at Preston in the parish of Tynemouth for some centuries John of that family in the beginning of this cen∣tury left by will a chalice for the communion and a yearly stipend for a Schoolmaster in the parish of Tynemouth  But to return from this digressionFrom the mausoleum at Seaton Delaval the walk is extended to  HARTLEY  which place was the possession of  Adam de Jesmont  as appears by the escheats of the reign of King John but in that age it was inconsider∣able when compared to its present state  The river anciently made its course due east until it was within a little way of the sea and then suddenly made a turn and discharged itself in a course due north The sea banks at this point form an angle one side facing to the north and the other almost full east At the point of this angle Sir Ralph Delaval erected his works to secure his little haven at the mouth of the river as mentioned in the foregoing note but Sir John in an age much advanced in mechanic knowledge brought his haven into its present state by cutting through the rock from the point where the river anciently turned towards the north to the sea on the east side of the angle so that the current now discharges itself into the sea in a straight direction almost due east and forms a harbour accessible with every wind and a moorage secure against every storm  Over the cut a

transcribe It appears to me to be the ancient boundary mark of the priory district many obelisks of this kind being fixed on the boundaries of church lands in the northern counties  A gentleman in the neighbourhood remembers it standing though in a tottering condition and much out of the perpendicular he thinks it was then near ten feet high it has lately been thrown down and broken two pieces of it are now remaining one of which measuring three feet and a half has been set up the other of about three feet is the part represented in Mr Grose's plate lying on the ground on the pedestal is the inscription  O horror to kill a man for a pigges head  the characters seem more modern than the obelisk This monument is of a whin stone its plan what is called an ob∣long square it is injured by time and besides which the country people have punched it so full of round holes and otherwise so defaced it as not only to render its ornaments unintelligible but also to make it doubtful whether all its sides or only the two broadest were ornamented  The following traditionary story relative to this monument is also given by Mr Grose  A Monk of this monastery strolling abroad came to the house of Mr Delaval an ancestor of the ancient family of that name who was then absent on an hunting party but was expected back to dinner among the many dishes preparing in the kitchen was a pig ordered purposely for Mr Delaval's own eating this alone suiting the liquorish palate of the Monk and though admonished and informed for whom it was intended he cut off the head reckoned by epicures the most delicious part of the animal and putting it into a bag made the best of his way towards the monastery Delaval at his return being informed of the transaction which he looked upon as a personal insult and  TYNMOUTH  depiction of Tynmouth Abbey  being young and fiery remounted his horse and set out in search of the offender when overtaking him about a mile east of Preston he so belaboured him with his staff called a hunting gad that he was hardly able to crawl to his cell The Monk dying within a year and a day although as the story goes the beating was not the cause of his death his brethren made it a handle to charge Delaval with his murther who before he could get absolved was obliged to make over to the monastery as an expiation of this deed the manor of Elsig in the neighbourhood of Newcastle with several other valuable estates and by way of  amende honourable  to set up an obelisk on the spot where he properly corrected the Monk Elsig was afterwards made the summer retreat of the Priors of Tynmouth  This story like many others of the like kind is very defective in several parts no date is affixed and the abovementioned monument is shewn in support of it it seems difficult to account for this Monk being so far from his monastery especially alone which was strictly prohibited by their rules and this not being of the Mendicant order he could not be going on the quest The only method of reconciling it is to suppose that this personage was a laybrother and servant to the house It however shews how dangerous it was to injure the meanest retainer to a religious house a peril very ludicriously though justly expressed in the following old English adage which I have somewhere met with "  If perchaunce one offende a Freeres Dogge streight clameth the whole brotherhood an heresy an heresy"  The town of  TYNEMOUTH  is well built being a place of great resort in the bathing season The Inns are good and there is every accommodation to render the situation agreeable  The present church stands a mile west from the town and was con∣secrated by Bishop Cosins King Charles II A D  THE PRIORY  lies to the east end of the town on a peninsula formed of stupendous rocks on the north side of the mouth of the river Tyne against which heavy seas break with great vehemence and tumult The approach to the priory in its present state is from the west by a gateway tower of a  square form having a circular exploratory turret on each corner from this gateway on each hand a strong double wall has extended to the rocks on the sea shore which from their great height have been esteemed in former times inaccessible The gate with its walls was fortified by a deep outward ditch over which there was a drawbridge defended by moles on each side The tower comprehends an outward and interior gateway the outward gateway having two gates at the distance of about six feet from each other the inner of which is defended by a portcullis and an open gallery the interior gateway is in like manner strengthened by a double gate The space between the gateways being a square of about six paces is open above to allow those on the top of the tower and battlements to annoy assailants who had gained the first gate By dif∣ferent accounts it appears that there was a place of considerable strength here in very remote antiquity Camden says  there are some appre∣hend that the rampier not the Roman wall went as far as to the very mouth of Tyne and affirm it was called  Penbalcrag  that is  the head of the rampier on the rock  I dare avouch this was in the time of the Romans  Tunnocellum  expressing  the promontory of Tunn or Tyne  where lay the first cohort  Aela Classica  enrolled probably from the name by  Aelius Hadrianus  the Emperor and in pay for sea ser∣vices for the Romans had certain light pinnaces termed  Luforiae  upon the rivers  What it was in the time of the Saxons as a forti∣fication we have little or no evidence to be depended upon The si∣tuation on the  ostium  of so important a river and so well calculated for the command of this shore induced  William the Conqueror  to order it should be converted into a fortress the religious inhabitants were ill suited to this plan and the first degradation of this monastery was by WALTHEOF Earl and Governor of  Northumberland  at the command of his Sovereign who it is known had very little veneration for religious institutions At this period it was fortified with the wall and tower before described  Robert Mowbray  Earl of  Northumberland  made choice of it for his stronghold when he rebelled against King William Rufus But as it usually happens with rebels he had ill success being closely besieged he withdrew himself into the monastery and claimed the be∣nefit of sanctuary a protection presumed to be inviolable in those days Notwithstanding which he was dragged forth by the conquerors car∣ried to Windsor and held in close durance there for a long time before he was put to death  Camden  On its being converted into a fortress it took  The  North West  View of  TYNMOUTH  depiction of Tynmouth Abbey  the name of Tynemouth Castle it belonged to the Earls of Northum∣berland from the time of  Waltheof  for several generations In Peck's  Desiderata Curiosa  Tynemouth Castle is mentioned in the list of castles bulwarks and fortresses garrisoned in the reign of Queen Elizabeth whereby it appears here was a master gunner and six inferior gunners In Camden's time it was in good repair he says  it is now called Tynemouth Castle and glories in a stately and strong castle  It was besieged by the Scots in when the garrison were obliged to sur∣render to the arms of the Parliament and submit to their instructions On this occasion there was delivered up pieces of cannon a great stand of arms with stores of ammunition and provision of very consi∣siderable amount Several of the garrison it is said during a violent storm escaped by the privies A large sum was appropriated by Par∣liament to restore the injury this fortress sustained in the siege and  Colonel Henry Lilburn  was made Governor but he deserting his party the garrison soon after revolted  Sir Arthur Hezelrig  who lay at New∣castle marched immediately to reduce them and took the place by storm the men scaling the walls in the most intrepid manner at the mouths of the cannon entered by the embrazures and portholes and after a short engagement with the garrison within the fortifications soon became masters of it In the conflict  Lilburn  was slain  On passing the gateway the scene is strikingly noble and venerable the whole enclosed area may contain about six acres the walls seem as well calculated for defence as the gateway tower the view is crowded with august ruins many fine arches of the priory are standing the most beautiful part of these remains is the eastern limb of the church of elegant workmanship The ruins are so disunited that it would be very difficult to determine to what particular offices each belonged On the south side adjoining the wall which stands on the brink of the cliff are several spacious vaulted chambers one of which I conceived was the kitchen from the large extended fireplace another the prison with an aperture in the top of the vault by which the miserable cap∣tive descended to his horrid dungeon On the north and east sides the cliffs appear to be about perpendicular fathoms in height at the feet of which on a broken rocky shore the sea beats impetuously From the walls on the south side you have a view of the batteries which command the mouth of Tyne with the barracks for the garrison On the north side is a house built by  Colonel Henry Villiers  once Governor of this fortress together with a lighthouse for the benefit of shipping  passing this dangerous coast These erections being made by licence from government  Villiers  was authorized to receive one shilling for every British vessel and sixpence for each foreign vessel anchoring in Shields harbour which produced a revenue of about l per annum a trifling gratuity for so beneficial a work  His Monument in the prioryyard has the following Epitaph  Hic fitae sunt mortales Reliquiae  Henrici Villiers Armigeri  Stirpe antiqua prognati  Unici  Honoratissimi Comitis de Jersey  Fratris  Nec non hujus presidii  Circiter Viginti annos  Fidelis et perquam dilectus  Praefectus  Vixit

arches comprehending several members in∣clining inwards and arising from pilasters After passing this gate in the area many modern tombs appear the ground being still used for sepulture The west gate entering into the abbey is still entire of the same architecture as that leading to the cloister The ground from the cloister to the south wall is almost covered with foundations of build∣ings which I presume are the remains of the priory Two walls of the east end of the church are standing the end wall to the east con∣tains three long windows the centre window the loftiest is near feet high richly ornamented with mouldings some of rosework and others of the dancette as the figure is termed in heraldry or zigzag a decoration common to old Saxon architecture The divisions or pil∣lars between the windows are enriched with pilasters of five members with highly finished foliated capitals and cornices Above the centre win∣dow is an oval one with like mouldings and the openings of a gallery on each side Part of the south side wall of the choir is also standing illuminated with four windows of like form as those to the east and equally ornamented though not of the same height for above them are an equal number of small windows the divisions or pillars between the larger windows are decorated with pilasters of the same kind as  those at the east end in the divisions or pillars between the smaller windows spring the groins of the arches which formed the roof by their remains shewing they were ornamented with rich mouldings The arches of the windows in this part are circular the blank arches which are thrown upon the wall beneath the windows are pointed The architecture through the whole of this part of the building is singularly light and beautiful the erection consists of a red freestone which en∣dures the weather well in this stormy situation  Beneath the centre window at the east end is a doorway of like ex∣cellent workmanship conducting to a small but elegant apartment which I conceive has contained the shrine and tomb of St Oswine On each side of the door is a human head cut in a stile much superior to that of the general taste of the age in which they are supposed to have been executed The apartment within is feet in length and nine feet in breadth and height On the south side is an entrance from the open yard with two windows on the north side three windows and a cir∣cular window to the east so elevated as to give place for an altar be∣neath there are two niches for statues at the east end a closet for the vessels for sacred offices and a bason for holy water on each side of the window is the figure of a Monk kneeling and two of the emble∣matical animals commonly depicted with the Evangelists the side walls are ornamented with pilasters from whence spring the groins and arches of stone which in various intersections form the roof the joinings of which are enriched with circles of carved work and the interstices of the roof are arched and constructed with thin bricks The circles con∣tain sculptures of the divine Personages with the Apostles of workman∣ship far from being despicable and all the figures are in good preser∣vation Round each sculpture is a circular belt with a sentence in the old English character well raised viz  Sanct Petrus ora P nobis  c each varied by the name of the personage to whom it is inscribed The centre row consists of four circles in one is the effigies of  John the Bap∣tist  with the like sentence in a second towards the west the effigies of our  Saviour  with a Monk kneeling in a third to the east the effigies of the  Supreme  with the Lamb bearing an ensign and in the fourth a representation of the last judgment with this sentence  In die judicii liberare nos  Above the door is the effigies of our Saviour with a globe in his hand with  morit P nobis  subscribed on each side of the door an emblematical figure as to the east There are two escutcheons the dexter one charged with bearings of Vesey a cross sable the si∣nister  the bearings of Brabant and Lucy quarterly  In P Monier's celebrated History of Painting c we have the following remarkable pas∣sages touching the original use of Paintings and Sculptures in the christian churches  One would have thought that the excellence of designing ought to have been kept up at  Rome  by reason that from the beginning of the  Christian Religion  the  Christians  made use of painting and sculpture to represent the histories of the Old and New Testament to adorn their  churches and tombs  St Gregory  In an oration which he made at Constantinople mentioned in the second Nicene Council Ac  Vidi saepius in∣scriptionis imaginem sine larrymis transire non potui cum tam efficaciter eb oculos poneret Historiam  of Nice assures us he could not refrain from tears at the sight of a picture wherein Abraham was represented about to sacrifice his son In his oration of  St Theodore  Pictor artis suae f  res in imaginibus exprimens res Martyris praeclare gefias Labores Cruciatus immanes Tyrannorum espectus impetas ardentem iliam flammas evomentem fer  atem beatissimum Atcletam Christiq certamini praesidentis ac prae  doctis tama  e

afferre  he describes the greatness and magnificence of a temple consecrated to that Saint He takes notice that his martyrdom was extraordinarily well done and that the characters of the grief and constancy of this martyr of the fierceness and cruelty of the tyrant and the assistance of our blessed Lord to crown this happy saint were as legible in this piece as in a book inso∣much that the Pictures on the walls were like a lively and useful sermon  Saint  Basil  confirms the same thing and says that painters do as much by their figures as orators by theirs and that both equally serve to persuade and raise the contemplators to virtue There were some excellent painters among the Greeks in the year for there was nothing more surprizing nor of greater usefulness than a piece of the day of judgment done by  Methodius  which so sensibly affected  Bogoris  Curtpal Ce  en Z  ar  related by Mr H D  Icon  ol  This  Methodius  was a Monk and Painter  Bogoris  employed him to paint a palace he had built He orderd him in general to draw representations of terror taking chiefly delight in pictures that represented the combats of hun∣ters with boars lions bears and tygers  Methodius  finding nothing more terrible than  the day of judgment  he painted it admirably well with all its most horrible and amazing circumstances and above all the reprobates on the left hand of the judge and delivered over by his sentence to devils to be dragged into hell  Bogoris  was so touched at the representation of this picture that he immediately resolved without further delay to turn christian  King of the  Bulgarians  that it converted that prince and afterwards all his subjects to christianity  Images in the christian religion began from the time of  Jesus Christ  the first that was made was by a lady whereof there is made mention in  St Luke  cha v This holy woman as an acknowledgement of her cure erected in the city of  Caesarea  a statue of I C It was of brass and at his feet was the statue of this woman in a supplicant posture She was so acceptable to God that he gave a miraculous virtue to a plant that grew at the foot of this statue and when it was grown high enough to touch the fringe of this image it healed all sorts of diseases  Ni  e Council  d Act  S Greg  a Espist to  Germ Bp of Constant  Several historians record this truth particularly  Eusebius  of  Caesarea  Eusebius  Lib  c  Chap This history is also related by  Antipater Bestrensis  and also by  Nicephorus Cas∣seterat    Metaph  s  There is also a large narrative of all these antient images in the book of  Subterranean Rome  who was an ocular witness of the truth of it and  Sozomen  reports that  Julian  the apostate by rea∣son of the hatred he bore to I C caused this famous statue to be taken away and ordered his own to be set up in its place but he was immediately punished for this sacrilege for light∣ning falling thereon consumed it to ashes  There are other authors who write that from the time of the apostles there were images of the painting of I C  Historiae quoq  says  Damascene proditum est Cum Abagarus Edesse Rex eo nomine pictorem misisset ut Domini imaginem exprimeret neq id Pictor ob splendorem ex ipsius vultu manantem consequi potuisset Dominam ipsum divinae suae ac vivificae faciei pallium admovisse Sicq illud ad Abagarum ut ipsius cupiditati satisfaceret misisse  Jo Damasc de orthod Fid Chap Baron Ann Tom an  and that our blessed Saviour was the inventor of them at the solicita∣tion of  Abagarus  King of  Edessa  who having heard of the miracles of C I sent a painter to draw his picture but when he could not lay down the design of it by reason of the shining rays that issued from his divine looks our Lord to satisfy the request of the King of  Edessa  covered his face with a linen vail whereon he imprinted his divine image and sent it to that prince by virtue whereof he was healed of a disease otherwise incurable In the time of the apostles were also to be seen images of the blessed virgin for St Luke made several of them this is witnessed by  St Gregory  the patriarch of  Constantinople  St Gregory  the writing to  Leo Isaurus  relates the same history and that they came out of all the East to worship this image  Cum Hyerosolymis ageret Christus Abagarus qui tum temporis dominabatur Rex erat urbis Edessen∣orum cum christi miracula audivisset Epistolam scripsit ad Christum qui manus suae responsum sacram glories amq faciem suam ad eum misit Itaq ad illam non manufactam imaginem mitte ac vide Congregantur illic orientis turbae orant  c  in what he writes to the Em∣peror  Leo Isaurianus  Theodorus  Theodoris  in his oration against  Leo Isaurus  Annal T Annal and in the d Council of  Nice  The same relation is confirmed by  Leo  Lecturer of the church at Constantinople who witnesseth the honour that was paid in his time to that image These are his words  Leo Religiosissimus Lector magnae egretiae Ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae dixit ego indignus vester famulus cum descendissem cum regis Apocrisariis in Syriam Edessem petivi venerandam Ima∣ginem non factam hominum manu adorati honorari apopula vide  c  further shews that the Empress  Eudoxia  sent one of these images painted by  St Luke  to  Pulcheria Augusta  Lucas vero qui sacrum composuit Evangelium cum Domini pinxisset imaginem pulcherimam pluris faciendam posteris reliquit  St Theodor Orat in Leo Arm  Teod Lect Collet L  there is also one to be seen at this day at  Rome  made by the same saint which is carefully kept by the religious of Saint  Sylvester  Although the history of the portrait of C I sent to  Abagarus  and that of the portrait of the Holy Virgin painted by  St Luke  are scrupled and contested about by some notwithstanding I thought fit to relate them here to shew the antiquity of images after the example of the second  Nicene  Council Those of the Apostles  St Greogory II  in his epistle to  Leo Isaurus  says of the first christians who painted our Saviour  Qui Dominum cum viderent prout viderant venientes Hierosolymam spectandum ipsum proponentes depinxerunt Cum Stephanum Proto∣martyrem vidissent prout viderant spectandum ipsum proponentes depinxerunt Et uno verbo dicam cum facies martyrum qui sanguinem pro Christo fuderunt vidissent depinxerunt  Confessors and Martyrs have been also painted and engraven in the infancy of the church The same  St Gregory  tells us the same thing as Pope  Adrian  I relates in what he writ to  Constantine  and  Irenaeus  He assures us that there were kept in the  Basilicum  and in the  Vatican  the portraitures  Had    Epist to Const    Irenaeus Baron  Annal to An and to An  of  St Peter  and  St Paul  which are those which  St Sylvester  shewed to the Emperor  Constantine  Constantine  to adorn his new city set up on all the gates the image of the  Holy Virgin  and upon that of his  palace  the image of  our Saviour  which  Leo Isaurianus  caused to be taken away He also caused to be raised in the middle of his palaces fine statutes of  our Saviour  in the form of the good Shepherd and that of the prophet  Daniel  in the lion's den H of the  Iconocl  of  Maimbourg  the Great after he was converted  Many little or∣naments are cut on the inferior roses on the arched work as croslets crescents winged crosses the old Saxon  as the emblem of

monastery was first founded as well as the founder are both uncertain By a passage in Leland's Collectanea vol p it appears that  Edwin  King of Northumberland who began his reign about the year and died in built  a chapel of wood  at Tynemouth wherein his daughter  Rosetta  took the veil and that this chapel was afterwards rebuilt by  St Oswald  with stone  Chronicon autore monacho Albanensi sed

account of this house says  Among the monasteries and churches founded by  St Oswald  the first christian King of Nor∣thumberland this is reckoned to be one though others ascribe its foundation to King  Egfrid  Although the exact aera of its foundation cannot be ascertained there are nevertheless sufficient proofs of its great antiquity insomuch that according to the learned author last cited  it is evident that St Herebald the companion of St John of Beverley was Monk and Abbot here in the beginning of the th century  Before the end of the th century this monastery was plundered by the Danes as it was again by them under Hunguar and Hubba in the next century and by the same Pagans a third time in the reign of King Athelstan The old church was dedicated to the blessed Virgin and seems to have lain desolate till the finding of King Oswin's relicks here a little before the con∣quest when to the honour of St Mary and that King Tosti Earl of Northumberland repaired and endowed

the Monks of Durham the Church of our Lady at Tynemouth with the body of St Oswin King and Martyr there in∣terred and died  Mon Aug v p  From the great disagreement in authors on these facts it is difficult to deter∣mine by whom these several changes were made but from the best au∣thorities I am led to conceive the first degradation of this monastery was by  Waltheof  Earl of Northumberland at the command of his King To shew some colour or pretext for so flagrant an invasion of the rights of the church he pretended it was an unfit situation for devotion  horridus incultus  Mr Wallis's ideas are excellent on this subject I will take them literatim as he gives them in his work  It is so far from being an unfit place for devotion that few can exceed it for presenting the mind with a variety of solemn objects capable of raising it to an adoration and awful reverence of the Deity The very precipice it stands on lofty and almost perpendicular whose semicircular base withstands the fury of the waves must have inspired the religious with a firm reliance on him who is the rock of ages the calmsthe stormsthe ships must all by turns have furnished them with occasions to praise him whose wonders are seen in the great deep  The monastery was dismembered from  Gyrwin  and made a cell to  Durham  Albrius Comes Northumb donationem de Tinemuth confirmavit ecclesiae S Cuthberti  Lel Col vol

Canons from that abbey This was said to be done in resentment as appears by Dugdale for some affront he conceived he had received from the Bishop of Durham It is remarkable that the very altar which he thus presumed to profane he sought to lay hold of as his sanctuary when his unsuccessful plots brought upon him the wrath of his Sovereign It is said by his treason he forfeited Fiefs so princely were his pos∣sessions  The Prior had the privilege of a market on Sunday and the priory had many wealthy endowments which were confirmed by the patents of many of our Kings from King Henry I to King Edward IV  These possessions are thus mentioned by Mr Wallis and Mr Grose  The Priors and Canons of Tynmouth had villas in Northumberland belonging to them with their royalties viz Tynemouth Miluton

situation as alledged by  Waltheof  was amply compensated by an advantage arising from thence the Monks knew well how to avail themselves of it the exalted rock on which this mo∣nastery stood rendered it visible at a great distance at sea in every di∣rection whence it presented itself as if reminding and exhorting Sea∣men in danger to make their vows and promise masses and gifts to the Virgin Mary and St Oswin for their deliverance Vows of this kind were common among the ancients and are to this day it is said made in some catholic states where the walls of churches are covered with the paintings of ships boats and other votive memorials Erasmus in his piece intitled the Shipwreck has very humourously described and ridiculed this custom of bribing heaven in case of sudden emergency In Germany below almost every dangerous fall or passage of the Rhine there is a hermitage whose Hermit or his Agent waits on the pas∣senger in the boat as soon as it has passed over requesting alms as a reward for his prayers to the efficacy of which it is intimated he owes his safety Something like this perhaps might be practised by the Monks from which they would receive many emoluments both in goods and money for the celebration of masses especially as the en∣trance into Shields harbour is at certain times both difficult and dan∣gerous  Many great personages lay interred here  E Libello de

unconnected with St Albans were at the dissolution valued by Dugdale at l s d by Speed l s d  The scite of the priory in the th year of King Edward VI was granted to  John Dudley  Duke of Northumberland but on his attainder reverted to the Crown and remained ungranted until the th year of Queen Elizabeth as is set forth in Tanner's Notitia  The  manor of Tynemouth  is now part of the possessions of his Grace the Duke of Northumberland  Much of the remains of the priory were pulled down by Mr Villars for erecting the barracks lighthouse his own house near it and other  edifices he likewise stripped off the lead which till then had covered the church  Grose  The first day of our abode here was employed in drawing views of the august remains The next morning being remarkably serene awaked me early to revisit the same scene and enjoy the sea breeze I walked towards the cliffsthe sun cast a ruddy gleam over a calm ocean the breeze scarce ruffled the leaping surgethe horizon glowed with clouds tinged with gold and crimson above which the feint blue of the verge gradually deepened into azure as the eye advanced towards the zeniththe sea appeared of a pale green strip'd with silver as the rays of light fell upon the tracks which were becalmedthe scene was enlivened by a fleet of vessels in number of various degrees of bur∣then which then passed in viewover the foreground of this prospect the solemn ruins were disposed in melancholy arrangement wearing a countenance more awful and majestic from the shadows which the eastern sun occasioned to be cast on themon the right hand and left the landskip presented itself full of life and business and to add to the effects this view had on the mind the morning drum was heard from the garrison the hum of the distant voices of busy men and the sound∣ing of the hollow shore beat by an advancing tide  Leaving Tynemouth we passed within sight of the barracks and batteries to  NORTH SHIELDS  which is not improperly compared to Wapping the streets lanes and alleys are narrow dirty populace and noisy It is astonishing what business is incessantly going on here we were told there lay in har∣bour even at that season of the year above sail of ships of consi∣derable burthen The crews of such a number of vessels the carpen∣penters ropers victuallers and men concerned in the merchandizing of such a fleet must necessarily occasion a mighty concourse and bustle to which being added the family of sailors residing here makes the place resemble a hive of bees  Shields has advanced to its present state of populousness trade and riches from a very low estate within the space of two centuries the  church was begun to be built in the year in the beginning of the reign of King Edward I it consisted only of six fishermen's hovels By the arguments in a cause depending between the King and his Bur∣gesses of Newcastle and the Prior of Tynemouth in the th year of that reign it appears that the Prior had built a town upon the bank of the water of Tyne on one side and the Prior of Durham another on the other side where no towns ought to be only lodges for fisher∣men and that the fishermen had there sold their fishes which ought to have been sold at Newcastle and that both the said Priors had caused to be made breweries and fisheries having great ships whereas they ought to have had but boats and had caused bread to be baked there which ought to have been baked at Newcastle It was decreed that neither at Tynemouth or Shields there be any sale of things saleable as in meats drinks c and that ships should not be laden or unladen there This will serve to shew what was the state of this place in the th century  We took a boat to examine this busy scene upon the water the sight of so many vessels and such a concourse of people is very pleasing it consequently brings to one's mind reflections on the powers of human faculties The genius of man is infinite if we could be taught for years we should discover at that period from the learning we had acquired that we had an infinity of subjects yet to learn for the more knowledge man attains the wider circle of objects unattained opens upon him As the scale of numerical calculation is without end as the variations of musical tones are infinite so is man's genius By the use of letters we have accumulated the learning of ages yet after the conclusion of a few centuries all our acquisitions will perhaps appear to posterity as but minute members of the science of mankind Before the use of letters with the fall of empires the accumulated knowledge of ages expired with them but henceforth it will not be so  How wonderfully perfect is all maritime science now to what it was in the most flourishing period of the Egyptian and Phoenician states We are told the timber for building the temple at Jerusalem was floated in rafts This shews the force of the shipping then employed The mariners of antiquity seldom trusted themselves from the sight of the coast The Grecian and Roman fleets were composed of insignificant vessels compared with a British navy The discovery of the magnet has given infinite powers to the Mariner our geometrical principles  have fitted our vessels for swift sailing and the carriage of great bur∣thens The ark of Noah was little better than a huge cask rolling on the face of the deep whose preservation was miraculous and not me∣chanical amidst the perils of an universal ocean The vessels of the Phoenicians were little superior to our limeboats their rigging and devices for sailing greatly inferior and the most excellent of the Roman gallies comparable only to the gilded barges of a Lord Mayor's shew The most superb vessel we read of in antiquity was constructed by Archimedes  it was a whole year in buildinghad twenty benches of oars the enormous pile was fastened together on all sides with huge nails of copper that weighed each ten pounds and upwards the inside had in it three galleries or corridors the lowest of which led to the hold by a descent of stairs the second to apartments and the first to soldiers lodgings  On the right and left side of the middle gallery there were to the number of thirty apartments in each of which were four beds for men The apartment for the officers and seamen had beds and three great rooms for eating the last of which that was at the poop served for a kitchen All the floors of these apartments were laid with small stories in different colours taken from the Iliad of Homer The ceilings windows and all the other parts were finished with wonderful art and embellished with all kinds of ornaments  In the uppermost gallery there was a gymnasium or place of exer∣cise and walks proportionate to the magnitude of the ship In them were gardens and plants of all kinds disposed in wonderful order Pipes some of hardened clay and others of lead conveyed water all round to refresh them There was also arbours of ivy and vines that had their roots in great vessels filled with earth These vessels were watered in the same manner with the gardens The arbours served to shade the walks  After these came the apartments of Venus with three beds This was floored with agates and other precious stones the finest that could be found in the island The walls and roof were of Cyprus wood The windows were adorned with ivory paintings and small statues In another apartment there was a library at the top of which on the outside was fixed a sundial  There was also an apartment with three beds for a bath in which were three great coppers and a bathing vessel made of a single stone of various colours This vessel contained quarts At the ship's head was a great reservoir of water which held an hundred thousand quarts All round the ship on the outside were atlasses of six cubits or nine feet in height which supported the sides of the ship these atlasses were at equal distance from each other The ship was adorned on all sides with paintings and had eight towers proportioned to its bigness two at the head two at the stern and four in the middle of equal dimensions Upon these towers were parapets from which stones might be discharged upon the ships of an enemy that should approach too near Each tower was guarded by four young men compleatly armed and two archers the inside of them was filled with stones and arrows  Upon the side of the vessel well strengthened with planks was a a kind of rampart on which was an engine to discharge stones made by Archimedes it threw a stone of weight and an arrow of cubits the distance of a stadium or paces The ship had three masts at each of which were two machines to discharge stones There also were the hooks and great lumps of lead to throw upon such as approached The whole ship was surrounded with a ram∣part of iron to keep off those who should attempt to board it All round were iron graplings disposed which being thrown by the ma∣chines might catch hold on the enemy's vessel and draw them close to the ship from whence it was easy to destroy them On each of the sides were young men compleatly armed there were as many about the masts and at the engines for throwing stones  Tho' the hold of this ship was exceeding deep a single man could clear it of all water with a machine made in the nature of a screw invented by Archimedes  Hiero having found there was no port in  Sicily  capable of contain∣ing this vessel except where it could not lay without Danger resolved to make a present of it to King Ptolemy and sent it to Alexandria  This is supposed to be Ptolemaeus Philadelphus  This was a more unwieldy and ungovernable mass than Noah's ark the comparison made between them and our shipping excites no small degree of wonder how they could ever perform the navigation for which they were respectively designed  What luxury what ease and splendour doth Britain enjoy from the labour of her Mariners things which we have rendered the common necessaries of our lives are furnished from the distant quarters of the earth even the very lower classes mix the produce of the East and West Indies for their common meal our dwellings are decorated from all the regions of the world and our tables are furnished with the dainties of every climatethe ancient eastern empires did not enjoy one half of our splendour or our luxury  When I compare this scene of man to the Shepherds haunts on the skirts of Cheviot mountains I am astonished on each hand at the wasted life and faculties of the Shepherd and at the extended powers of the busy race before me  We passed by Howden Pans where a large ropery and smithery are carried on  WALL's END  lay in our way formerly belonging to the Monks of Durham given to them by William De Carilepho Bishop of that See in the year a pretty village the name evidently derived from its situation on the extremity of the Picts wall  At the east end of the village is the schoolhouse given by the sister of James Moncaster  Esq  Wallis  At a little distance lies  CARR VILLE  once the seat of the  Cosens's  named by  Mr William Carr  who rebuilt it not many years ago Near it is  the extreme Roman station on the wall  By most Antiquaries it is admitted to be the  Segedunum  of the Romans a name derived from its situation and being a magazine for corn for  the supply of the Roman stations  From the Manuscripts of the late Roger Gale  Esq  Extract of a letter from  Chris Hunter M D  to  Roger Gale  Esq  SIR  Durham  th  May    Give me leave to attempt the recovery of one of the  Roman stations  in this country both re∣quisite for the security of navigation in the northern seas and the protection of their frontiers beyond the river  Tyne  thereby saving the great expence and trouble of building the wall as far as the sea at  Tynemouth  no less than three miles at least I mean that near  South Shields  at the entrance of the said river into the ocean and which cannot but have flourished till the  Danish invasions  as  Mr Leland  has it in his  Collectanea vol  iv  p    E Regione Tinmuthae fuit urbs vastata a Danis Urfa nomine ubi natus erat Oswinus Rex  The communication it had with  Binchester  is visible in several places as is the angle where the paved way goes off from the  military way  leading to  Lanchester  about three miles to the north of  Binchester  and passes to the northeast through  Brancepeth Park  thence a little to the south of  Brandon  and is lost in the cultivated grounds but appearing upon  Durham Moor  in the same direction again passing by  Haghouse  and below upon  Harbrass Moor  is very visible tending past  Lumley Castle  in a direct line towards  South Shields  passing about a mile to the east of  Chester in the Street  without any signs of communication therewith Two elevated pavements in the river  Tyne  the one at the west end of  South Shields  the other on the north side of the river near the end of the  Roman wall  proper for their safe landing at different times of the flowing and ebbing tide fully shews its necessary correspondence with  Segedunum  the first station upon the wall but another military way called  Wreken Dyke  passing from this station to the west has hitherto frustrated the enquiries of our late Antiquaries  Mr Horsley  himself pointing out its  ductus  very justly over  Gateside Fell  where it passed the public road and a little to the west the Roman way going to the south from  Newcastle  to  Chester in the Street  and afterwards running through  Lamesley  and  Kibblesworth Fields  advances to the south∣west over  Blackburn Moor  and through the township of  Hedley  it comes next to  Causey  a vil∣lage which owes its name to it and from thence ascends a high hill and terminates at  a square fortification  upon the top thereof at  Stanley  the seat of the Hon  Sir Nicholas Tempest Bart  who I am told possesses several Roman coins found therein  This place tho' not above three miles from  Chester in the Street  and four from  Lanshester  seems to have had no immediate communication with either of them no vestigia of any paved way appearing upon the adjoining moors and being situated as  Chester  itself at the termina∣tion of a military way gives me convincing reason to believe the use of each has been the same namely to guard  herds of cattle  at grass for the subsistence of the two garrisons of  South Shields  and  Pons Aelii  and for victualling ships resorting to the first place whereas had its elevated situation been intended to form  a castrum exploratorium  then must the advantage of paved ways to the next stations have been necessary for the speedy conveyance of intelligence Tho' this last military way bears the name of  Wreken Dyke  I am apt to believe that name is rather due to the way leading from  Binchester  to  South Shields  especially from the authority of  Ranulph Higden  who says the  Wreken Dyke  or  Reken Dyke  passed from the west of England and ended at  Tinemouth  I dare not fix a Roman name to this our station without the authority of in∣scriptions  I am Sir c CHRIS HUNTER  It lay conveniently for the small vessels employed by the Romans on the coast to scour the seas of pira∣tical rovers From the ruins it seems to have had a quay for the con∣venience of merchandize or perhaps was decorated with some pleasure buildings on the shore It was the station of the first cohort of the  Lergi  In the walls of  Mr Cousins's  seat before it was rebuilt Mr Horsley observed several Roman inscriptions which are preserved in his work  Severus's wall has very manifestly terminated in a square fort or station above a furlong to the east of the mansion called Cousins's House The ruins of a Roman station and town at this place are very discernible though it has all been ploughed and is now a very rich meadow The stones and rubbish of the buildings are levelled and covered with earth and grass but yet the ramparts of the fort may be distinctly traced out both they and the ditch being visible almost quite round  In Mr Warburton's Vallum Romanum and Mr Horsley's Brit Rom are the following particulars which I will transcribe as at the time I visited this station I could not traverse the ground without injuring the crops growing  There are very evident remains of two turrets at the western and eastern entries to the station and of another at the south∣west corner The west entry has been close to the wall and the eastern one directly opposite to it The fort has been about yards or perhaps six chains square and so the contents of it above three acres and an half About yards of the western and eastern sides lie without or to the north of the line of the wall and eighty within it so that the wall falls upon the sides of the station not far from the middle of them The south rampart of this fort is about three quarters of a furlong from the river side and runs along the brow of the hill or at the head of a considerable descent from thence to the river There have been ruins of buildings on this part and to the southwest of the fort but they are now so levelled and covered that little evidence appears above ground yet the stones and remains of rubbish are easily discovered when the surface is any where removed and some of these inequalities in the surface which usually arise from ruins yet remain and may easily be perceived to be hillocks of stones or rubbish  Mr Horsley gives the following inscriptions as belonging to this place  I Cohortis primae centuria Fiari posuit  This stone with the five next as also a piece of an altar and part of a pedestal are all placed in niches in the outside of the wall belonging to Cousins House where they have stood unob∣served and neglected for many years and being exposed to the winds and weather have suffered very much by that means I cannot find that the least notice has been taken of them before the four first are plainly centurial such as were generally placed in the face of the wall and are rarely found in any other station Hence we have one argument that this station was built at the same time with the wall in the reign of Severus The cohorts mentioned in these in∣scriptions were certainly legionary The mark for the century is very clear and distinct in all of them and the names of the centurions as in most others of the same kind are in the geni∣tive For which reason I think that the mark is not to be read centurio but centuria as it is frequently read in Gruter and that  posuit  is to be supplied or understood at the end so that  cohortis primae centuria fiari  is much the same as to say such a Captain's company of such a regiment Indeed  centurio cohortis  or the centurion of a cohort does often occur in inscrip∣tions but does not necessarily imply that the whole command of the cohort was in a single centurion for we have also  centurio legionis  and  miles legionis  which can signify no more than such a person was a centurion or a soldier in such a legion  III  COH X Erected by the century of Justinus Secundus in the tenth cohort  IVSTINI  Erected by the century of Justinus Secundus in the tenth cohort  SECVNDI Erected by the century of Justinus Secundus in the tenth cohort  IVCohortis decimae centuria Siinsi Prisci posuit  This has sustained more damage than the former by being exposed to the weather for the number of the cohort is effaced The mark for the century is also faint and one of the cen∣turion's names very obscure but the other name Priscus is plain and clear the letters being gross tho' short and cut very deep in the stone The former name Siinsus sounds somewhat oddly but there are many as uncouth in Gruter  VI Jovi Optimo Maximo  A small altar no other inscription appearing  Mr Gordon supposes that the wall itself forms almost  a right angle and then is continued down to the side of the river but it is the western rampart of the station which makes that angle with the wall nor does this rampart reach the river though it is likely the town or buildings without the fort may have extended so far On the north side of the station there are some crooked risings and setlings of the ground which at first view appeared to me not unlike a round fort or tower projecting from the station with a triple rampart and ditch The two closes in which the Roman town and station have stood are called Wall Lawes If the name Lawes be owing to the rising ground only the termination Lawes or Lowes which signifies hills so far cor∣responds to the Roman name Segedunum But as there were two dis∣tinct Tumuli observed by Mr Warburton remaining near a place he calls the Beehouses and not far from these closes he apprehends that from them they have borrowed this name a Lawe or Lowe being one of those names by which Tumuli are frequently expressed There was an altar and some centurial inscriptions at Cousins's House in Mr Horsleys time  The wall having left this station passes on westward and at a little distance the remains of a castellum are visible It is feet square like those mentioned in the most western parts of this county it is built close to the wall and wholly within it on the south side From hence the wall passes by Walker or Wallkier or Byker Hill and thence de∣scends to Ewesburn where are some ruinous heaps which may pro∣bably have been the remains of some of the smaller exploratory turrets that have been placed all the way upon the wall Hence the wall seems  to have passed through the house at Red Barns and enters Newcastle at Pandon Gate  Mr Horsley and other authors seem very doubtful of the vestiges of the military way from the wall's end to Newcastle Near the Red Barns and upon the descent from Byker Hill to Ewesburn they con∣ceived the track where it had gone might in some places be traced but the appearance was so very faint and obscure they would not insist upon it  As for Hadrian's vallum Mr Warburton says he could no where in all this space discern the least track of it nor did he ever hear of any traditionary account of its having been there  Mr Pennant  Tour in Scotland vol II p  says  it was supposed to have reached no further than Pons Aelii or Newcastle on the east But by an account he had recently received from Mr Robert Harrison of that town he found it extended on this side as far as the wall of Severus A broken stone has lately been discovered at Wall's End with this inscription  HADR  MVR COND  HOC MARM  POS COSS D  The distance from the station at the end of the wall to St Nicholas's church in Newcastle is exactly three measured miles and five furlongs and in this space there are three castella all visible that which should have been next in course is lost in the station at Newcastle  LITTLE BENTON and LONG

a good taste The following account of this place and its possessors I have extracted from the notes of Mr Bourne's History of Newcastle page  It has been handed down by tradition to the present day that this was a place of retreat for King John when he came into this coun∣try and there are still to be seen the ruins of an ancient building which carries the name of King John's palace On the north side of this old building are the remains of a fortification which 'tis natural to conjecture was built for the safety and security of this house and consequently this house must have been of some great distinction Robert de Gaugy was a great man in the reign of King John and had special trust reposed in him by his Sovereign and it is not im∣probable when the King came to these parts he lodged at this house  The present house was built in the year and is so situated that on the west it overlooks the Town Moor Fenham and part of the lands of the Prior of Tinmouth on the east it faces the Shields road on the north it has a most agreeable prospect to the windings of the Ouse burn of its woods and banks and of the villages situated on it on the south it faces the river Tyne  Hardriding near Haltwhistle is the ancient seat of the Ridley fa∣mily above one of the old doors there a date earlier than the con∣quest appears and the initial letters of the builder N R This was a younger branch of the Ridleys of Willimoteswicke of which branch was John Ridley a Major in the service of King Charles I in the Duke of Newcastle's army  Bishop Nicholas Ridley was of this branch and was born  here  Mr Bourn says I presume he means at Hardriding He was educated  in grammar at Newcastle on Tyne He suffered in near Baliol College in Oxford  "Dr Thomas Ridley was also of this family He

appearance as the very eye of all the towns in this  part of the kingdom ennobled by a fine haven where ships of great burthen lay in security It is situate on the uneven risings of a hill north of the river Tyne over which is a fair bridge on the left hand thereof stands the castle and on the right the Marketplace and principal part of the city in regard to the elegance of its buildings From thence the ascent is very steep to the upper town which is of much greater extent than the lower graced with four churches and fortified with strong walls having eight gates with several towers  This description given by Camden compared with the present state of the town will clearly point out the great improvements made therein since his time  It is admitted by all Antiquaries that this place is of Roman origin  From the Manuscripts of Roger Gale  Esq  Extract of a letter from  Chr Hunter  Esq  M D  to  Roger Gale  Esq  th May  Pliny  is the only author we can gather any thing from remarkable concerning the  Varduli  and that so very concise I think deserves a place here  In conventum Cluniensem Varduli ducunt populos  XIV  ex qutbus Albanenses tantum nominare libeat Nat Hist Lib  III  Ca    Sect  of the last Paris edition and in Lib IV Ca Sect he enumerates the  Verduloruin Op∣pida Morosgi Menosca Vesperies Amanum Portus ubi nunc Flaviobriga Colonia  where  Mr Hardauin  recites the modern names and as  Gruter  's almost infinite collection affords no in∣scription wherein the  Varduli  are named I presume the Roman oeconomy under the Emperor  Trajan  by descent a Spaniard if not sooner had abolished the old distinctions of separate governments and reduced the whole province under one general name  Hispania  which after∣wards the  Notitia Imperii Occidentalis  divides into three consular provinces under the direction of Presidents and places no garrison of the  Varduli  in any fortress in the eastern or western empire  I am Sir  Your's c CHRIS HUNTER  Answer to the preceding letter by  Mr Gale  London  th June  As to the two inscriptions you sent me I will venture to give you my thoughts on them not doubting but you will excuse me where I differ from you since what I offer proceeds only from a love of truth and no spirit of altercation  The first of them is very curious as it gives us the name of a  Legatus Augustalis Propraetor  hitherto unknown in Britain and which ought as I think to be read as follows  Numini Augusti et Genio Cohortis secundae Vardullorum Equitatae Miliariae sub Antistio Advento Legato Augusti propraetore F Tiranus Tribunus dat dedicatque Rite  To read G R in the th line  Gregulium  is not a little doubtful it cannot well be supposed that the tribune of the cohort would dedicate an alter to the deity of the Emperor and at the same time to the genius of the common soldiers exclusive of the genius of the officers of which he himself was one and how to read it otherwise is as uncertain if the letters are G R as in your copy but if they are C R as on the altar given us by  Mr Horsley  Durham No in his Brit Rom and which you say has C very apparent instead of G they may denote  Civium Romanorum  and these  Varduli  a people of Spain admitted to the freedom of the city of Rome for some extraordinary merit or by some Emperor's favour perhaps their country∣man Trajans this was a privilege frequently conferred on foreigners even whole towns and nations and at last communicated by Antoninus Pius  omnibus  Vide Span  Exercit de Civ Rom apud Graevii Thes Tom XI p S C  in commune subjectis  by which it seems as if this altar had been erected before this general grant of that Emperor for it is no great honour or advantage for these Varduli to value themselves upon if they had enjoyed it only in common with all the rest of the world  Monsieur Spanheim  observes  Exercit  ma  ad Constitution Imp Antonini de Civ Rom Quod sub M Antonino Imp Civitate donati essent qui∣cunq in Romani orbis provinciis aut oppidis delecti essent Milites ut Praesidiarii in Imperii limitibus constituerentur  this seems contradictory to the first mentioned grant since it only confers the freedom of the city upon the soldiers in garrison on the frontiers of the empire and the other gives it to all the subjects of the Roman empire without exception perhaps the soldiers had this advantage given them at first and upon finding the encouragement it gave them to defend the countries where they were quartered it was thought adviseable to admit all the subjects of the empire to the same privilege to interest them the more in preserving the whole from the attacks of the Barbarians but there has been no small uncertainty among the learned to which of the  Antonini  this constitution is owing some attributing it to  Antoninus Pius  others to  Marcus Aurelius  and  Mr Spanheim  with great reason to  Antoninus Caracalla  from  Dion Cassius  chiefly who tells us this privilege was granted by him  Omnibus qui in Orbe Romano erant  not so much for the honor and advantage of it to the people as for the filling his treasury since it made them liable to the payment of several taxes from which they were before ex∣empted so that the soldiers had this benefit conferred on them for their services and the rest of the people afterwards most likely to drain their purses  In Gruter's Thesaur p CCCCLV is mentioned  T Antistius Praefectus Alae Sulpiciae  C R  i e Civium Romanorum  and in page CCCCLIX  L Praesentius Praefectus Coh  I  Afr  C R E which is read  Praefectus Cohortis Primae Afrorum Civium Romanorum Equitatae  Vide Urfatus C R  just the same as that at Lanchester only changing  Afrorum  into  Vardulorum A Cohors Equitata  was composed partly of horse partly of foot as  Vegetius  Lib C  informs us  Prima Cohors habet mille centum et quinque Equites Loricator centum triginta duos et appellatur Milliaria  I must own the  Cohors  in this inscription is called  Secunda Vardulorum  but that is only in respect to the  Cohors prima Vardulorum  of which an inscription was found at  Riechester  in Northumberland This second Cohors of the  Varduli  might however be the  prima auxiliaria  of some legion perhaps the VI and in more esteem for some eminent service or fortunate accident than the first not dignified with the honourable title and privileges  Civium Romanorum  and perhaps also independent of any legion and after all the sole reason why one of these Cohorts was called the  first  and the other the  second  might have been from the priority of time when they were first raised  This  Antistius Adventus  seems also to have been  Legatus Augusti Propaetor in Belgium  from an altar found near  Utrecht  upon which he is called  Caius Antistius  Jovi Opt Maximo summano Exsuperantissimo soli invicto Opollini Lunae Dianae Fortunae Marti Victoria Paci Colus Antisius Adventus Legatus Augusti Propraetore Dat  and this justifies my reading of his titles here  Legatas Augusti Propraetore Dat  and not  Legionis Augustae Propraetore  there being no mention of a military body in the  Belgic  inscription besides we never meet with a legion stiled  Augusta  singly without some other adjunctive distinction as the  Legio  II VI or  Antoniniana Augusta  nor could there be any such officer as a  Praetor or Propaetore Legionis  that magistrate being intirely  civil  Sir  Your's c R GALE  but of what importance or magnitude the Roman station was which  occupied a part of this ground no evidence appears Camden adopts the name of  Gabrosentum  which he thinks might be derived from its vicinity to the steeps on the opposite shore of Tyne as being the haunt of herds of goats These etymologies are sometimes so constrained that they rather bewilder than instruct It is as probable the name of  Gabrosentum  might from the same cause extend to the cliffs and hills on both sides of the river The Notitia places  Gabrosentum  within the wall and makes it the station of the second cohort of  Thracians  Other An∣tiquaries  Dr Hunter Mr Horsley Mr Pennant  insist upon its name of  Pons Aelii  where the Romans had a bridge to the southern shore and that it was garrisoned by the  Cohors Cornoviorum  this they attempt to confirm from the traces of a military road discovered in a lineal direction from the bridge to  Chesterlestreet  Dr Stukeley conjectures that this was the station  Admurum  of Richard of Cirencester  Dr Stukely p  in his Map of  Britania Romana  No altars or inscrip∣tions have been discovered to ascertain the name If there was once a Roman station here every vestigia thereof must long since have been destroyed by the works of a large populous and ancient town The remains of the  Roman wall  or wall of  Severus  have frequently been discovered by workmen in digging the foundations of buildings in those parts of the town through which it lay It passed from the west through the Vicarage gardens the Groat Market the north part of St Nicholas's church and from thence to  Pandon Gate  This gate bears singular marks of antiquity the superstructure is of different workmanship and model from any others on the town wall the arches are circular and there appears that natural decay on the whole struc∣ture which might happen in such a number of years Camden says  at Pandon Gate there remains it is presumed one of the turrets of the Roman wall differing in form and workmanship from the others on the walls of the town  By the dimensions which I took of this gateway I find it nearlycorresponds with the other ports or gates in the Roman wall It is said the Carpenters Tower is also of Roman ori∣ginal The reputed antiquity of  Pandon Gate  is denoted in a proverb of common acceptation  "As old as Pandon Yates"  We have no authorities to fix the certain aera when or by whom this place was first inhabited from the evacuation of the Romans or how long it remained deserted after their departure like other strongholds within the defence of the Roman wall it is reasonable to conceive it was very early resorted to by the distressed Britons and was kept up by them as a place of security against the northern rovers The first name we find it distinguished by in history was  Monkchester  which shews that it was noted for being the habitation of religious men  Pennant  What society of religious and whether Saxons or not took up their  residence here at what time they first possessessed the place or when they were expelled are circumstances unknown all the evidence re∣maining is the name only  Bede  in his Ecclesiastical History and Life of St Cuthbert is totally silent relative to them and as his residence was at  Jarrow  situated within a few miles and he died in the name of  Monkchester  and the residence of those religious must have suc∣ceeded his death Mr Pennant says  their destruction must have been early for the venerable Bede takes no notice of the place The ruin therefore of this place cannot be attributed to the Danes whose first invasion did not take place till after the death of that Historian  It appears to me the argument holds the other way for had it been the residence of any religious society who suffered persecution before or in the time of  Bede  he would have noticed it Fiftynine years elapsed between the time of  Bede  's death and the first descent of the Danes on Northumberland in this period of time the increase of reli∣gious houses was very rapid and it is reasonable to conceive such ex∣amples as  Landisfarn  and  Jarrow  had produced would greatly promote like institutions in their neighbourhood From Hollinshead's authority we are induced to believe that on the visitation of  Aldwin Alfrin  and  Remfrid  in  there was not a monastery remaining in this part of Northumberland and scarce a church was left standing  This was a desirable situation for the Danes when they entered the Tyne and to that aera I am inclined to fix the destruction of the reli∣gious society which had settled here and from whose residence the name of  Monkchester  was derived  In when  Robert Courthose  the son of  William the Conqueror  re∣turned from his Scotch expedition he halted here to refresh his army and finding the situation proper for a fortress to command the turbu∣lent Borderers and the river well adapted for the reception of succours by sea as well as trade built a  castle  here to which he gave the name of  Newcastle  in contradistinction it is said to a small circular tower  Bourne  which the Monks held or to the Roman turrets on the wall  From this period we may date the growing importance of the place the protection of a fortress on the banks of so fine a river would draw thither a great number of setlers and trade would soon begin to flourish  under such propitious circumstances There was so rapid a progress in its improvements that before the death of King David I of Scotland who held it as a member of his  earldom of Northumberland  it was be∣come a place of great importance David having founded here two monasteries  Tanner Keith  Tanner says a nunnery was founded here as early as the conquest  Newcastle  was defended by a strong wall and an outward ditch of great depth now much gone to decay From Leland's account it appears that this fortification was begun in the reign of King Edward I and compleated in the reign of King Edward III A rich citizen hav∣ing been taken prisoner in the middle of the town by the hasty irrup∣tion of a hardy band of Scots who would not set him at liberty with∣out a considerable sum for his ransom on his return he set about to secure his native place by a wall his fellowcitizens promoting so important a work for the protection of their merchandize and riches In the th year of the reign of King Edward I the royal licence for fortification was obtained But it is the opinion of some that the northern wall was built in the reign of King John and that the re∣maining part of this fortification began from the above event in the reign of Edward I  Grey's Chorograph  The circuit of the wall rather exceeds two miles  Two miles and yards  it is defended by towers the chief of which are of a cemi∣circular figure machicolated towers are intermixed but not regularly which project a little over the wall and there are also many guerrets  They were decorated with the effigies of men cut in stone placed on the tops of them as though they were watching They had square holes over the walls to throw stones down  There were seven ancient gates  A gate at the Bridge End  Then turning on the right honde to the Key a chapell of the towne withe a macsun dieu  Then a certen houses with a Watar Gate and a sqware haull place for the towne and a chapelle there as I remembar  Then a mayne stronge wall on the haven side to Sandgate to Tynemouthe way  Then towers to Pandon Gate  There harde by dothe Deene water dryve a mille and passithe

hedds of condutes for fresch watar to the toun  Lol Itin v p  the names of which together with those of the towers point out the many contributors to so considerable  a work To these gates two were added in more modern times  Bridge Gate  which guarded the pass of the bridge and  Sand Gate  which opens upon the river's banks The wall formerly extended between Bridge Gate and Sand Gate which part some few years ago was taken down to open the quay an alteration greatly for the convenience of trade The form of the wall there proved it to be of the most modern date of any part of the fortifications there being therein many small gates to give access to the quays Sand Gate had no tower above it as the other gates  THE GATE OF WALKKNOWLE is said by some to be of Roman architecture  The wall upon the Knoul cannot be understood of any other than the Roman wall be∣cause it had this name from very ancient times long before the building of the town wall  Bourne  and part of Severus's work its present superstructure is modern being the hall of the  Carpenters  company  This was one of the Roman towers as was very visible before the taking down the upper part of it for it was of the same size model and stone with the tower of Rutchester in Nor∣thumberland  Ibid  PAMPEDON is the next gate formerly opening upon an ancient town of that name which was united with Newcastle by the grant of King Henry III A D whereby it was ordained  Et quod praedicta villa Novi castri et terrae tenemen predict in Pampedon unica villa etcet sunt et unus Burgus ad uniend et concludend dictam vallam Novi castri in emendationem et augmentationem ejus villae c  It is said that in  Pampedon  was  a palace of the Saxon Kings of Northumberland  Pennant Bourne  This gateway was defended by folding gates of iron  Wallis  the present ascent to the top of the wall is by stairs two  yards wide From the remains of the superstructure it is not at this time possible to gain any certain idea of the form or capaciousness of the Roman turrets  The part of the wall which extends from Sand Gate to  Pampedon  and from thence to the  Austin Fryers Tower  is pointed out by Mr Wallis as being the work of the Burgher who was surprized by the Scots King Edward III granted to the Corporation the duties and customs of the town for the term of seven years to enable them to compleat the fortification but finding them negligent of a work of such importance he revoked the grant and constituted  Henry de Percy Ralph de Nevil John de Fenwick John de Creyk and Robert de Fenwick  then Sheriff of Northumberland Commissioners for keeping the town after which the franchises were not restored to the Burgesses 'till they consented to perfect the work at their own costs  Wallis  In the reign of King Henry VIII this place is said to have exceeded in the strength and magnificence of its works all the cities of England and most places in Europe  Leland's Itin  A small tower called  Corner Tower  Austin Tower  succeeds next in course said to be built by the Friars of the order of St Austin for defence of their monastery which stood near to it It is now the hall of the  Ropers Company  who re∣paired it A D  Carliol Tower  is next deriving its name as it is conjectured from one of the family of  Carliols  who were ancient burgesses here Nicholas carliol was mayor in the second year of the reign of King Edward II during whose mayoralty perhaps this tower was erected It was re∣paired A D and fitted up as a hall for the Company of  Weavers  The next in succession on the wall is  Pilgrimstreet Gate  being the great passage of  Pilgrims  to the shrine of the Virgin Mary at  Jesmond  or Jesus Mount as being one of the principal approaches from the north this is a very strong edifice flat roofed with embrazures a port cullis and iron gates A D it was repaired and made the hall of the Company of  Joiners  Ficket Tower  is next of which nothing remarkable is noted by Bourne and others  Bertam Mon Coucher  tower is next A person of this name was High Sheriff of the county of Northumberland in the th year of of King Edward the Third's reign and for three successive years in the reign of King Richard II but in what manner he was a contribu∣tor to these fortifications or how this tower happened to take his name is not known  New Gate  is next the common prison for which use its works are constructed of superior strength The original gate was supposed to be one of the most ancient parts of this fortification the Roman towers excepted The present edifice is modern the north front being orna∣mented with a statue of King Charles II two wings were added within this century one A D the other A D to enlarge and render the prison more commodious  Andrew Tower

in place of which there is nothing remarkable  West Gate  is a considerable edifice excellently constructed and very strong it is defended by a port cullis and iron grated gates This building is attributed to Roger Thornton  Esq  At the West Gate came  Thornton  in  With a  Hap  and a  Halfpenny  and a  Lambskin  Bourne  whose memory in the annals of this place ought to be greatly distinguished for his munifi∣cence and liberal spirit The Company of  House Carpenters  lately re∣paired and fitted up the tower for their hall  Pink Tower  is next in succession and in the next place a Postern opens upon the Firth  Gunner Tower and Stank Tower  next succeed of which nothing re∣markable is observed The next  West Spital Tower  or Saint Mary's it is said was built by the master and brethren of St Mary's Hospital  The building of  Nevil Tower  is attributed to one of the great  Nevils Earls of Westmoreland  their family mansion stood near it This Tower was repaired A D for the  Masons Bricklayers and Plaisterers  hall  In the next place is a  Postern  called  White Friar Gate  a convenient passage for the  Carmelites  or White Friars to and from their monastery  Not far from thence is the  White Friar Tower  built on the summit of a vast eminence above the street called the  Close  its form is circular it is flagged on the top and embrazured from thence you have the most extensive prospect any part of these fortifications commands you view the whole of the upper town and great part of the lower a vast  tract of country down the river and a landscape as beautiful and ex∣tensive towards the west and north as any in this part of Northumber∣land This building is attributed to the House of Carmelites which stood immediately opposite its eminence is such that from the Close Gate you ascend to it by steps The inner part of the tower con∣tains the Masons hall  The  Close Gate  is near the present extremity of the wall on the banks of Tyne I am inclined to conceive the ancient fortification of this town did not consist of an entire circumvallation but that the walls terminated in two points as they approached the river near to Close Gate and Sand Gate  The town after the compleating of the walls was divided into wards according to the number of the gates and round towers in the wall which towers and gates were wont to be defended in times of hostility with the Scots by the particular wards appropriated to them  Bourne  Having described the walls I must in the next place consider the interior fortress  The  Castle  all authors agree was built by  Robert Carthouse  son of William the Conquerer in the year on his return from his Scotch expedition he perceived the great consequence of such a for∣tress on the frontiers commanding so fine a river and in a situation excellently calculated for assembling the northern levies on any dis∣turbance on the borders The tower built by  Robert  was of great strength square and surrounded by two walls the height of the tower is feet the square on the outside feet by the walls feet thick with galleries gained out of them there was a chapel within the tower  Pennant  The outward fortifications are now defaced and their scite crowded with buildings The tower still remains entire the corners projecting from the plane of the square a mode much practiced in the Norman structures It is situate on a lofty eminence commanding the whole town the principal entrance is on the south What num∣ber of gates were in the outward wall we cannot now determine but from Bourne's account of it which I shall quote in its proper place the area inclosed by this wall contained three acres and one rood The Castle belongs to the county of Northumberland and makes no part of the liberties of Newcastle or its Sheriffdom the government of it st September st of King Henry VII was granted to William  Close  Esq  for life as Constable and in the th year of the same reign it was granted to Roger Fenwick  Esq  with l per annum salary since which time I do not find that any Constable has been appointed but the Sheriffs of Northumberland had custody of the Castle It now serves for the county prison and in the great hall the Judges of assize hold the gaol delivery  Soon after the building of this castle it is said by Bourne that  Robert de Mowbray  Earl of Northumberland when in rebellion against King William Rufus was besieged therein and this fortress after suffering much damage was taken but I confess I do not find sufficient autho∣rities to support this assertion of my author and think it is much to be doubted The Scots by treachery A D in the st year of the reign of King Stephen gained possession of the castle and town which they held to the year when Malcolm IV ceded the northern counties to King Henry II  In the yere of Henry the the King of Scottes had the Erledom of Lancastre yn his handes the cite of Cairluel Bamburgh Castel and Newcastel  Lel Col v p  The castle having suffered much by neglect in that and the succeed∣ing reign King John restored it and added a ditch to the fortifica∣tions in doing which he was obliged to destroy several houses as a compensation to the owners of these tenements he ordered s d rents in escheats to be paid yearly as is set forth in his charter to the town  The records have of late years been strictly kept and much interest must be used to have access to the archieves to me whose intention was chiefly to make a descriptive view such applications were not of such moment as they are to the learned compiler from whom we may in a little time hope to receive a compleat  History  of Newcastle  This castle was considered of such consequence that most of the neighbouring Baronies paid considerable sums towards its support under the articles of Castleward and Cornage the several sums are mentioned in Bourne's history  The Barony of Herons  Dilston  Walton  Bolbeck  Bolam  Gaugye  Marley  Bothal  Delaval  Rosse  Bywell And  Copun  Besides the larger payments several small ones issued from sundry houses and lands in the town  Bourne says  In the th of King Edward III an inquisition was taken at this town whereby it was found that at the time of the battle of Bannockburn which was in the year when John de Kenont Knight was High Sheriff of Northumberland the Castle and all its edifices about it were in good repair that after that time Nicholas Scot Adam de Swinburn William Riddel Johannes de Fenwick Cuthbert de Broughdon Johannes de Fenwick Johannes de Woodhorn Johannes de Lilleburn Willielmus de Tynedale Roger Mauduit and Robertus Darreius were High Sheriffs of Northum∣berland during which time the great tower and also the lesser ones of the said Castle the great hall with the King's chamber adjoining to it together with divers other chambers below in the Queen's mantle and the buttery cellar and pantry the King's chapel within the castle a certain house beyond the gate which is called the chequer house with the bridges within and without the gate with three gates and one postern were l worse than before They also say that there are in the custody of Roger Mauduit late High Sheriff fother of lead they say also that it was thought highly necessary that the Baron Heron of Huddeston the Baron of Walton Lord Robert Clifford of the New Place Chief Lord of the Barony of Gaugie the Lords of the Barony of and Devilston that the Lord of Werk upon Tweed the Lord of the Barony of Bol∣beck alias Bywell the Baron of Bothal and lastly the Baron of Delaval should build each of them a house within the liberties of the castle for the defence of it  There were two great strong walls which surrounded the castle the interior wall was of no great distance from the castle itself as may be still seen in several places The exterior wall surrounds the verge of the castle borders From this outer wall were four gates the great gate and three posterns The north side of the castle is the main gate called now the Black Gate it had two port culicesses one without the gate as may be still seen and another within it at a little dis∣tance from it the ruins of which were to be seen a few years ago There still remains a piece of the old wall which shews its situation to have been where that house is which was lately purchased by Mr Jasper Harrison The shop belonging to this house was dug as I am informed out of the wall just now mentioned On the east side of the castle there was a postern which led down to the street called the Side which is still to be seen it was once called but many years  after it was in decay the Waist of Laurentius Acton On the south side of the castle is another gate which leads down the Castle Stairs to the street called the Close this was the south postern There is a building upon it which was the county Goaler's house On the west side was the postern facing Bailiff Gate now the dwellinghouse of James Lidster  There is an house in the yard which they say was the chapel of of the garrison which is called the chapel house to this day it stands northeast from the chapel its common name now is the Three Bullsheads  By an inquisition taken in the reign of King James I it appears this castle was then much out of repair and in the th of the same reign another having been taken complaint was made that a great dunghill heaped up against the wall on the west side of the castle had done damage to the amount of l it was under the same inquisition com∣plained that the great square tower was full of chinks and crannies and that onethird of it was almost taken away that all the lead and coverings which it had of old were embezzled and carried off inso∣much that the prisoners of the county of Northumberland were most miserably lodged by reason of the showers of rain falling on them The computation made for repairs was l s In the dung∣hill was taken away by Sir John Morley and it is said was used to make a rampart on the town walls against the Scots he also repaired the round tower under the Moothall now called the Halfmoon  Wallis  It has been continues Bourne a building of great strength and no little beauty the vast thickness of the walls speaks the one and the ruins of some curious workmanship the other The grand en∣trance into the castle was at the gate facing the south which leads up a pair of stairs which still shews the magnificence of the builder to a very stately door of curious masonry The room this leads into has its floor broken down close to the castle wall as indeed all the other floors are to the top of the castle so that excepting the floor above the county gaol there is not one left though there have been five divisions or stories of the castle besides this This floored room which I was told was lately flagged by the order of William Ellison  Esq  when he was Mayor in seems to me without any doubt to have been the common hall of the castle because on the north side of the same room there is an entrance by a descent of some steps into a room where is the largest fire place I saw in the castle which plainly speaks it to have been the kitchen At the end of this there are several stairs which lead into a place under the kitchen which I think goes down as low as the bottom of the castle this I take to have been a cellar as I do also that little dark place on the right hand coming up again to have been a sort of pantry The door I mentioned just now on the east of the castle which leads to the first broken down floor is because of its grandeur and beauty an argument that this room has been the most stately one in the whole castle another reason for its being so is because of the win∣dows which gave light into it those of them that face the east are the most beautiful of the whole castle beside On the south of this room there is an entrance into a sort of a parlour or withdrawing room which has a fire place in it and has been a piece of curious workmanship as is visible to this day and this place has no com∣munication with any part of the castle but this room On the north side of this room is a door leading into an apartment where stands a well of considerable depth it was yards before we touched the surface of the water which seems to have been placed there on pur∣pose for the more immediate service of this room There are some little basons on the top of the well with pipes leading from them which conveyed water to different apartments of the castle this is plain from what may be observed in the county gaol at the bottom of the castle the round stone pillar in it having an hollow in the middle of a foot wide with a lead spout in the side of it  In the inquisition made in the th of King Edward III above men∣tioned among other things that were complained of for being ne∣glected one was Capella Domini Regis infra castrum This chapel I have been told stood on that part of the castle yard where the Moot∣hall is but upon searching I found it in the castle itself according to the account of it just now mentioned The door of it is at the bottom of the south wall of the castle adjoining to the stairs which lead into the state chamber It has been a work of great beauty and ornament and is still in the midst of dust and darkness by far the most beautiful place in the whole building the inside of it being cu∣riously adorned with arches and pillars It is easy to observe the dif∣ferent

of it was given by three sisters whose names have long since been ungratefully buried in oblivion  When was the particular time of its building I have met with no account but it is not difficult to give a probable guess The order itself of the Dominicans or Black Friars came into England in the year consequently it must have been founded after that time and that it must have been founded some years before the year is plain to a demonstration for in that year which was the th of King Henry I the Black Friars had licence from the King to break a door through this new or town wall into their garden which proves them a regular settled body at that time and therefore that their priory was built some years before that licence  We are told that this monastery was in old time called the Grey Friars which in my opinion is a thing highly improbable for the Grey Friars or Franciscans came not into England till about the year and if as I have proved above the Black Friars were a set∣tled body some years before how is it possible to have been called of old time the Grey Friars This is therefore a mistake and besides the Dominicans came into England before the Franciscans or Grey Friars and therefore more probably were sooner in this place  It has been a very stately building as appears by the present re∣mains of it The area or grass plot is about feet in length and as many in breadth On the east side of it was the chapel which is now the hall of the company of Smiths in this town On the west side of it is a curious old well which served the monastery with water called our Lady's Well On the south may still be seen the ruins of a curious front on which side is the hall of the Cordwainers in which I saw a pair of winding stairs which they told me before they were walled up led by a vault as far as the nunnery of St Bar∣tholomew On the north of it were their gardens a part of which was the Warden's Close before the building of that part of the town wall This appears by the charter granted to the monastery in the reign of Edward I about the breaking out that narrow gate in the wall between Westgate and Newgate in which grant it is said that the wall went through the middle of their garden The monastery was dependant on the priory of Tynemouth  In the reign of Edward II the brethren of this monastery had li∣cence granted them for the building of a draw bridge beyond the new ditch of the castle  Who were the Priors of this monastery what eminent men be∣longed to them or what things were transacted by them from their beginning till their dissolution were things undoubtedly preserved among themselves whilst they were a body but after their surrender were either destroyed or have not yet come to light  One of the Priors of this monastery was one Richard Marshall I take this gentleman to have been the last Prior of this monastery for in the th of King Henry VIII a grant of a tenement near the White Cross signed by Friar Richard Marshall Doctor and Prior and Friar David Simpson and Friar John Sourby was given to An∣thony Godsalve upon his paying to the said priory or monastery s per annum This grant is now in the possession of Mr Thomas Mar∣shall of Newcastle Joiner who purchased this tenement and has lately rebuilt it He pays the same rent to the town of Newcastle which the tenement paid to the monastery About two years after the signing of this deed in January the th of this reign this mo∣nastery surrendered It consisted of a Prior and Friars  What became of the brethren of this friary after their surrender what they had allowed them annually for a maintenance or whether they had any thing allowed at all does not appear Some account in∣deed I met with afterwards of the Prior himself but none of the Friars  It is this which follows  Richard Marshall Prior of the Black Friars in Newcastle about the year went into Scotland and preached at St Andrew's that the Paternoster should be addrest to God and not to the Saints Some Doctors of the university being disgusted at this assertion pre∣vailed with one Tofts a Grey Friar to undertake to prove that the Paternoster might be said to the Saints whose ignorance in doing the same was so manifest that he became the common jest and quitted the town  After the surrender of this monastery the Black Friars was granted to the town of Newcastle in consideration of l s d The annual value of it was l s d  The King says in his grant that he gives to the Mayor and Bur∣gesses of Newcastle the whole house and scite lately a priory or house of brethren called vulgarly the Black Friars in Newcastle upon Tyne the chapelhouses edifices gardens c the hall two chambers a chamber called the Cross Chamber and two gardens with their ap∣purtenances and the whole close within the Westgate and another close near the scite of the said priory on the north and a close con∣taining three acres and a house in the same close without the walls of the said town and a house called the Gatehouse situated near the said street It also appears from the first grant that the King re∣served to himself and successors the bells and lead that was upon the church belonging to this friary and the other buildings of it the lead in the gutters together with the stones and iron of the church c  The Nine Crafts of this town had their meetinghouses or halls in it and still have except two of them the Taylors and the Cordwainers who have bestowed these upon some poor widows and got themselves others in their places These halls are of great service to this ancient building in preserving it from intire ruin Such is the hall of the Smiths which was repaired by them in the year the hall of the Dyers the hall of the Bakers and Brewers which was repaired by them in the year these halls are on the east side of the friary Such also are those on the west side of it viz the hall of the Sadlers which was repaired by them in the year and the hall of the Skinners and Glovers which was repaired by them in the year Such are those also on the south side of it viz the Cordwainers hall which was turned into apartments for three widows in the year the hall of the Butchers and the hall of the Tanners were repaired in the year  By the means of these halls there is still some visage of the friary remaining which had otherwise been intirely in dust 'Tis a pity that those people who are permitted by the companies to reside in some of those rooms are not threatened into more cleanliness  This still remains a matter of complaint for it is abominably filthy and the curious pass through it amidst those unseemly annoyance of which some animals are peculiarly delicate in their concealment  and that the companies themselves are not at the expence of repairing the area Were these things done it would be a beautiful piece of an∣tiquity  and the entertainment of the curious from whence soever they come  Browne Willis in his History of Abbies says Roland Harding was the last Prior of

others who had also a salary paid them out of the town and continued in the like manner till the late civil wars  The salaries were not one and the same but added and increased as the town thought fit Upon this first settlement they had those salaries out of the town for preaching in the forenoon and the parishes contributed for their preaching in the afternoons Some time after the town of Newcastle made an addition to the former salaries and gave them an allowance for preach∣ing both forenoon and afternoon after which augmentation the parishes gave no further con∣tribution In this state have the Lectureships continued ever since with an alteration still of salaries more or less as there was occasion and at the will and pleasure of the patrons and when any vacancy happened in any of the said churches the Mayor Aldermen and Common Council of Newcastle have from time to time chosen another in such room and stead and the Bishop of Durham for the time being did always hitherto allow and approve of by his licence such person so chosen being duly qualifiedNote the Lecturers of St Nicholas and Allsaints have this further advantage in it which makes it the more valuable that this preferment does no ways disqualify or incapacitate them from holding other livings with the cure of souls  Randal's Manuscripts  The church is a stately building placed on a fine elevated

light and open lanthorn graced  with pinnacles of extraordinary beauty the whole has the most uncom∣mon and pleasing appearance not unlike a magnificent imperial crown It is justly allowed by all travellers to be the finest piece of masonry of the kind in Europe This tower most authors agree was built in the time of King Henry VI by one Robert Rhodes On the bottom of the bellfry is this inscription Orate pro anima Roberti Rhodes  Great disputes have arose who this Robert Rhodes was Grey says he was Prior of Tyne∣mouth in the time of King Henry VI Others suggest he was one of the Justices of the Bishop of Durham and quote a register at Durham to prove Robert Rhodes and Agnes his wife lived about the year but Bourne with great propriety fixes on an eminent Merchant in New∣castle and gives powerful arguments for his determination  Bourne tells the following remarkable Story  That when the Scots besieged the town in the civil wars and made ineffectual efforts to reduce it they sent a message threatening to destroy this fine steeple in consequence of which the Mayor ordered it to be filled with Scotch prisoners then in the town which being made known to the besiegers they forbore to shed the blood of their countrymen and the elegant edifice was saved  from thence it is conjectured by several that this was the name of the founder  Pennant vol p  The

for one age at least drop a tear whilst his expe∣rienced benevolence gives the estimate of his loss and on whose im∣mortal character future ages will contemplate with veneration and Joy the great

at the foot of Pilgrimstreet it was built before the year This is said to be one of the largest cures in the king∣dom  Grey is of opinion that it was dedicated to All Hallows or All Saints from the antient name of that part of the town  Pampedon  which he says was so called from  imagining I suppose that it was so called of the Romans after the temple of Rome the Pan∣theon which was dedicated to all the Gods  The church is yards ¼ foot long and yards feet broad a square tower the bells were founded in of the metal of the statue of King James II removed from Sandhill The name of Robert Rhodes

loft erected for that purpose just over the passage out of the church into the chancel out of this mystery it is said that the church represents the church militant and the chancel the church triumphant and who will pass out of the former into the latter must go under the Rood loft that is they must go under the cross and suffer affliction This image was wont to have the Virgin Mary on one

spout which hangs from the top of this quire This was a conveyance for an artificial dove on the day of Pentecost to represent the descent of the Holy Ghost That there were such things in churches though in none that I know of in this town but this is matter of fact For thus we are told that on Whitsunday they began to play a new interlude then sent down a dove out of an owls nest devised in the roof of the church but first they cast out rosin and gunpowder with wildfire and that must needs be the Holy Ghost which cometh with thunder and lightning  Bourne  In the church yard on a elegant

to it and the Mastership of St Mary's Hospital is generally annexed The Master of the school hath a convenient dwellinghouse belonging to it  The charity school of the parish of St Nicholas was opened

principal edifices before mentioned there are several pub∣lic buildings here  The Town House and Exchange on the Sandhill originally founded by Roger de Thornton In the year this public edifice was re∣built by the Corporation on the present plan  The Exchange contains a variety of apartments and also the Courts of justice for the town Is of the architecture of the period of James I The builder Robert Trollop is buried opposite to it in the churchyard of Gateshead His statue pointing towards the Exchange stood formerly over his grave with these lines under his feet  Here lies Robert Trollop  Who made you stones rollup  When death took his soulup  His body fill'd this holeup  Pennant  The story of the statue is believed to be fabulous an anonymous writer has said lately in his strictures on the above publication that the Epitaph has always been said to be made by Daniel De Foe whilst at Gateshead on some occasion and adds  At present there is neither inscription  nor  statue  nor  do I believe there ever was on Trollop's monument  Whether Mr Pennant's known veracity will go further than the splenetick froth of a man who dares not subscribe his name to his  belief  the reader must determine  the front towards the  river being ornamented with two series of columns The expence a∣mounted to l l of which was advanced by the Corpora∣tion and l a donation from Alderman Weimouth compleated the work The area in front was ornamented with an equestrian statue in copper of King James II the horse in a vaulting attitude supported by a pedestal of white marble This statue was by an outrageous mob pulled down AD and appropriated to furnish bells for the church of Allhallows or Allsaints The statue was said to be of ex∣cellent workmanship and cost l An elegant plate was published of it in  The Trinity House at the Head of the Broad Chair In it are apart∣ments for persons to whom s per month with coals and cloath∣ing are given it also contains a spacious hall and a neat chapel Dal∣ton's Place stood upon this ground It is not known when or by whom the monastery of the Trinity was founded The original insti∣tution of the order of the Holy Trinity was in in the time of Pope Innocent III and was for the redemption of captives from slavery The Trinity House we are now speaking of appertains to the fraternity of Mariners who have received three several royal charters one in the d year of King James I the second by King Charles II and the third by King James II  Randal  The Mansion House in the Close the temporary place of residence of the Mayor It is an elegant modern building with a spacious area on the banks of Tyne  The Freemen's Hospital in the Manors founded by the Corporation in for a Master and poor Freemen or their widows The  Master's annual allowance l each of the Brethren l The building is handsome three stories in height ornamented with a piazza yards in length an open area with a fountain in front  Davison's Hospital for six widows of Clergymen or Merchants The building was erected at the expence of the Corporation and the endow∣ment was made by Mrs Ann Davison the relict of a Merchant of this town The allowance to each is s quarterly  The Barber Surgeons Hall  The Maidens Hospital built by the Corporation in and en∣dowed by a donation of l from Thomas Davison  Esq  of Ferryhill in the county of Durham and his sisters and the like sum of l from the munificent Sir Walter Blackettfor the reception of six maiden women and six poor men  The Keelmen's Hospital a square building with cloisters near Sand∣gate built in by a contribution of d each tide from every Keel∣man plying upon the Tyne within the liberties of Newcastle It con∣tains upwards of chambers but is said to be neglected and without endowment It is wonderful this laborious and useful race of men whose toils help to contribute such immense wealth to Newcastle should not have claimed the attention of the Corporation from whose revenue more donations issue in charitable and religious appropriations than any other Corporation in the North of England can boast  The Infirmary stands in an airy elevated situation behind Westgate and near the public walk called the Forth It was founded by subscrip∣tion for the relief of the sick and lame of Newcastle and the counties of Durham and Northumberland To this excellent foundation Sir Walter Blackett gave l out of the interest money arising from which donation he appointed l a year should be given to a Clergy∣man to do duty there So happy a relief has this charitable institution proved that from the time of its commencement to April patients have been discharged cured  To these may be added the Hospital for Lunatics and the Hospital for Married Women lyingin as also the fund raised for the support of those who liein at their own houses  An elegant Hall  has lately been erected in High Friar Chair by the society of  Free and Accepted Masons  of the Lodge of St John it is richly ornamented and has an excellent organ for their solemn rites It was dedicated in the year to attend which ceremony there was the most respectable and numerous convention of that order that ever ap∣peared in the northern parts of this kingdom The music was per∣formed by an excellent band the vocal parts of which were done by the best voices from the quire of Durham cathedral A pathetic exhor∣tation was delivered by Mr Huntley and an elegant oration display∣ing the antiquity progress and excellence of the order by the Rev Dr Scott of Simonburn The festival was held in the new assembly room when at three tables near of the brethren dined together at which time that regularity order and harmony were maintained for which this society above all others in the world is remarkable where men of all ranks political opinions and religious persuasions meet without envy or contention and preserve a unanimity and bro∣therly love in despite of the frailties and fickleness of the human heart  The history of this place is very dark antecedent to the time of Ro∣bert Carthouse and the building of the castle from whence it is pre∣sumed the name of Newcastle was derived The advantages of a fine navigable river with a situation defended by so strong a fortress would soon induce Merchants and others to fix there yet we find no record of any royal charter liberty or franchise granted to the settlers till the reign of King Henry II when they obtained a royal charter which is said to have comprehended great privileges  Gardiner ch p  but of what nature these were our author is silent King John in the d year of his reign confirmed the above charter on payment of marks and two palfreys  Madox Firma Burgi p  In the th year of his reign he greatly enlarged those li∣berties and powers and expressly  in consideration of the loyalty and faithful services of his burgesses there  he granted them several ex∣clusive privileges among which are an exemption from the power of the Sheriff of the county at large and that they should be amenable to the Courts only within their own jurisdiction except in matters rela∣tive to the rights of the Crown The government of the borough was then under four Bailiffs only  King Henry III by charter appointed a Mayor to preside in the government of this borough together with four Bailiffs From this Prince the Burgesses derived two most excellent bounties viz the Castle Demesnes containing acres for free pasturage with liberty of win∣ning coal and stone as also a plot of ground called the Forth contain∣ing about acres Here the Infirmary stands a portion of the ground is inclosed and converted into a public walk One thing very singular in this royal charter is the prohibition against Jews residing within the borough  This was one of the boroughs that received the

borough it was returned that by  the custom established within the borough the real estates of freemen within the borough had always been considered in the nature of chattels and as such were disposed by will which special custom was accordingly confirmed  King Edward III confirmed all its franchises and privileges and added thereto an exemption from the jurisdiction of the Constablery Marshalsea and Admiralty of England within the port and limits of the borough He gave the Town Moor to the Burgesses in perpetuity  he also gave licence to the Burgesses to purchase lands he confirmed many bylaws made by them for wellgoverning the borough directed the mode of electing Mayors Magistrates and Officers he settled the measure to be used in the sale of coals and made the Burgesses tollfree for their merchandize throughout his dominions  King Richard II in the first year of his reign A D con∣firmed the charters before granted to the Burgesses he afterwards granted them ground for roads and a bridge  This was to enlarge and render more commodious the access to the bridge  In he gave li∣cence for a sword of state to be borne before the Mayor  It was not till the reign of King Henry IV that Newcastle received the most distinguishing marks of royal favour on the accession of this Prince the borough received a confirmation of all ancient liberties and immunities besides which he also granted that this borough should for ever thereafter be independent of the county of Northumberland that it should have a Sheriff as being a county of itself a district not above miles in circuit which Sheriff should supply the duty of the Bailiffs whose office was from thenceforth revoked and annulled that the Sheriff should hold his county within the liberties of the borough on Wednesday

that the Burgesses should hold the Conservatorship of the river Tyne from Sparrow Hawk to Hedwin Streams with the royalties thereof a space of miles within which limits no ship should load or unload any sort of goods but at the quays of Newcastle The present quays are esteemed equal to any in England being upwards yards in length King Edward II granted the Conservatorship of the river Tyne to John Earl of Hampstead but the same was soon revoked on its being represented an infringement on the rights of Newcastle  King Edward VI on the dissolution of the Bishopric of Durham by act of parliament A D granted to Newcastle the town and li∣berties of Gateshead he also proposed to have erected a Bishopric at Newcastle out of part of the revenues of the dissolved See  The preamble of the act sets forth "That this Bishoprick being then void of a Prelate the gift thereof was in the King's pleasure and the compass of it being so large as to extend itself into several shires far distant it could not be sufficiently served by one Bishop and since the King by his godly disposition was desirous to have God's holy word preached in those parts which were wild and barbarous for lack of good preaching and good searching there∣for he intendeth to have two good Bishopricks for that diocese the one at Durham which should have marks yearly revenue and another at Newcastle with and also found a cathedral church at the latter place with a Deanery and Chapter out of the revenues of the said Bishoprick therefore the Bishoprick of Durham is utterly extinguished and dissolved and authority given for letters patents to erect the two new Bishopricks together with a Deanery and Chapter at Newcastle with a proviso that the rights of the Deanery Chapter and Cathe∣dral of Durham should suffer nothing by this act"  but these purposes were defeated by the death of the King and on the accession of Queen Mary the Bishopric of Durham was restored  The preamble sets forth "That certain ambitious persons taking advantage of the late King's minority made an interest by sinister practice to procure the dissolution of the Bishoprick that it was done out of mercenary views to enrich themselves and their friends by seizing the lands of the See rather than upon just occasion or godly zeal that Tunstall Bishop of Durham was deprived upon unjust furmises and false accusations and that the process against him was foul and illegal that upon a full examination of the matter by the Queen's commissioners the sentence of deprivation was declared void as may be seen at large by an authentic instrument that the Queen had new founded the Bishoprick by her letters patents and restored all the lands in her possession But that neither the sentence of deprivation nor the Queen's letters patents were of sufficient force to recover the honours lands c to the See of Durham therefore to restore the Bishoprick to its former interest privileges and revenues the two dissolution statutes of the last reign are hereby repealed"  Queen Elizabeth confirmed to the Burgesses all the liberties and im∣munities granted by her predecessors and added thereto many privileges by her charter dated as Mr Wallis says on the d March in the d year of her reign but as it appears by a note to Bourne's History in the st year of that reign It was then declared to be a free town with power to the corporate body to purchase lands to them and their successors in fee and perpetuity and to grant and demise the same and that they should have a common seal that they should exercise an Admiralty Jurisdiction within their own liberties exclusive of any au∣thority of the Lord High Admiral  The Corporation is now governed by a Mayor Sheriff and Al∣dermen the Borough sends two Members

inflicted on the disturbers of the peace here are worthy notice  A common Drunkard was led through the streets as a spectacle of contempt covered with a large barrel called a Newcastle cloak▪ one end being out and the other having a hole made through it sufficient for the offender to pass his head through by which means the vessel was rested on his shoulders  The Scold wore an iron engine called the branks in the form of a crown it covered the head but left the face exposed and having a tongue of iron which went into the mouth constrained silence from the most violent brawler  The trade of this place is very great to enter upon an exact de∣tail would exceed the limits of my work the exports chiefly consist of coals wrought iron lead glass salt bacon corn salmon butter tallow and grindstones its situation is such as necessarily renders it the place of supply for an extensive country in articles of imported merchandize In the summary I have given of the trade of the county in the succeeding pages the importance of this place will appear In Mr Pennant's work it is stated that in the year the shipping mentioned in the following table were entered here with imports     ships  carrying tons  from foreign parts     ships  carrying tons  coasting trade  Total    tons     Here are glasshouses three sugarhouses several soapboileries a considerable manufactory of steel and iron also a manufactory of broad and narrow woollen cloaths carried on with great success Sel∣dom less than firkins of butter and hundreds of tallow are annually exported from hence  The chief article of export is coal  Great disputes have arose touching the time when coals were first used in this island  Our Antiquaries have conjectured that the Romans knew how to win them and their use yet in the discovery of their hippocausts and of the vaults where the remains of sacrifice have been found it is not asserted by any that the remains of any coal fires have been discovered  Matthew Paris mentions  Carbo Marinus  In the st year of the reign of King Edward I mention is made  de Carbonibus Maritimis  and their measure  In the st year of that reign a complaint was made of the public nuisance the burning of coal was in the city and suburbs of London by corrupting the air by the stink and smoke and a proclamation was issued to prohibit its use and afterwards a Commission of Oyer to punish those who used it in defiance of the proclamation  Pryn's Animadvers Coke's Institutes p  By a charter of King Henry III A D licence was given to win coal in the Castle Field and Forth  In the th of King Henry V a duty of twopence a chaldron being paid to the King the burthen of keels was limited by statute to chaldron and the keels were directed to be sealed by the King's officers to prevent frauds in the duty St K Hen cha  In a charter of the th of King Henry IV  De privilegijs Libert Epi Dun  A charter of the th of King Richard III is recited  De Carbonib aliis Merchandizis vendendis  Queen Elizabeth granted a charter to the Fraternity called Free Hostmen for the vending of Coals reserving a duty of d a chaldron  By the stat King Charles II Commissioners are appointed for regulating the duties on coals c  The quantity of a Ten of coals is uncertain and not always the same but commonly Newcastle chaldrons make a ten Two keels also make a ten and waggons a keel Each waggon contains bolls and upwards at gallons to a boll and bolls or thereabouts go to a fother and three fothers and a quarter make a chaldron corves to a score and fother make a ten  A square yard of solid coal contains eight bolls  An acre of ground contains square yards of solid coal which is near equal to tens at chaldrons to a ten which is near equal to chaldrons of coals  Three square yards and a quarter go to a chalder  Waggon ways were first used in this neighbourhood soon after the revolution by Mr Allan of Flatts in the county of Durham and on the Tyne by Charles Montague  Esq  at Stella  ships of great burthen take in their lading at Shields the coals being carried thither in large un∣wieldy lighters called keels limited by government to the burthen of chaldrons being nearly circular in form and very flat bottomed sometimes navigated by a square sail at other times managed with the advantage of the tide by one oar plied at the side and another at the stern which serves as a sculler and rudder Near of these  vessels find constant employ on this river No vessels exceeding tons come up to the Quay  The collieries which supply this exportation about in number lie at considerable distances from the river From the mines the coals are sent to the places of lading in large unwieldy carriages or waggons of the form of a common millhopper carried on four wheels of iron the fellies or rims of which are hollow so as to run upon strings of wood adapted thereto with which the roads are laid By this means these carriages on an easy descent run without horses and sometimes with that rapidity that a piece of wood called a tiller is obliged to be applied to one wheel and pressed thereon by the weight of the at∣tendant who sits on it to retard the motion by the friction of which frequently the tiller and sometimes the carriage is set on fire  In the course of the year chaldrons of coals were im∣ported in the port of London from Newcastle and Sunderland on the the river Wear in the county of Durham which is chaldrons more than the year and chaldrons more than in the year In the year chaldrons were imported at London  A manuscript note in the margin of Bourne's History of Newcastle in Fisher's Circulating Library p  In ships were cleared at the Customhouse of Newcastle of which were coastways and for foreign parts being upon the whole less than in the year  The great export of this place is coal for which it has been noted for some centuries It is not exactly known at what time that species of fuel was first dug It is probable that it was not very early in general use That the Romans sometimes made use of it appears in our for∣mer volume p but since wood was the fuel of their own country and Britain was over∣run with forests it was not likely that they would pierce into the bowels of the earth for a less grateful kind But it was exported to foreign parts long before it was in use in London for London likewise had its neighbouring forests We find that in King Henry III confirms to the good people of Newcastle the charter of his father King John granting them the pri∣vilege of digging coals in the Castle Moor and converting them to their own profit in aid of their feefarm rent of one hundred a year which moor was afterwards granted to them in property by Edward III The time of the first exportation of coals to London does not appear In the th year of Edward I they were considered in the capital as a nuisance for on the repeated complaints of Prelates Nobles Commons of Parliament and Inhabitants of Lon∣don against the stench and smoke of coals used by Brewers Dyers and other Artificers the King issued out his proclamation against the use of them which being disregarded a com∣mission of Oyer and Terminer was issued to punish the disobedient with fines for the first of∣fence and for the second by the destruction of their furnaces In we find that their use was not only tolerated but their consumption made beneficial to the state for in that year a duty of sixpence per ten each quarter of a year was imposed on ships coming from Newcastle In the trade became so important as to engage the regulations of government and or∣ders were given about the lengths of the keels so that the quantity of coal might be ascer∣tained From that period the commerce advanced continually  Pennant vol II p     Ships  Tons

allowance to the Mayor during his year is very ample  The exact amount of the revenue and allowance to the Mayor is not easily gained by a traveller it must be got by particular confidence  a

guttural pro∣nunciation in which words containing the letter R are articulated with difficulty This seems to be derived from the Danes In a degree the same guttural pronunciation takes place through all Northumberland  Newcastle was the seat of many remarkable occurrences and events On the incursion made by David I King of Scotland A D in the reign of King Stephen he took Newcastle and obliged the inhabi∣tants to swear allegiance to the Empress Maude as their Queen David having made this place his head quarters remained there till a truce was entered into with King Stephen who lay with his army at Dur∣ham  On the restitution of Newcastle to the Crown of England King Henry II confirmed to the burgesses and inhabitants their estates and granted them an exemption from tolls and duties  King John and William the Lion King of Scotland about the year met at Newcastle and held a conference The Scotch King lay ill here for a considerable time  In or the King of England and Alexander King of Scot∣land had a conference at Newcastle on the demand made by the Scotch King for restitution of Northumberland Westmoreland and Cumber∣land The Queen of Scotland also was presentChron Mailross  In the year King Henry III assembled a great army and marched to Newcastle whilst the King of Scotland marched to Ponte∣land There were horse among the English troops finely armed In the Scotch army were horse with armour of iron or network to which were added foot but no engagement ensued as Alex∣ander who before had denied King Henry's supremacy now submitted to acknowledge Henry as his liege Lord and agreed to bind himself not to enter into any league with any of the enemies of the King of England  In the year Newcastle had its first Mayor Petrus Scott Knt  In on the eve of St Nicholas great earthquakes were felt here accompanied with dreadful lightnings and thunders the appear∣ance of a fiery dragon in the heavens and a blazing star  In the year after the Regency of Scotland was dissolved Baliol swore fealty to King Edward I in the castle of Norham in the pre∣sence of many of the Nobility of both nations The next day the royal commission was issued directing John St John to place Baliol in the royal chair at Scone according to the ancient mode of inauguration of the Kings of Scotland in which duty St John represented Duncan Earl of Fife then a minor whose hereditary office it was gained by his ancestors for their distinguished services This ceremony was soon after performed on St Andrew's day after which Baliol passing into England did homage to King Edward on Christmas day at Newcastle in the hall of the castle  In the year an open rupture taking place between the two kingdoms the Scots professing to throw off the English yoke King Edward appointed the st day of March for his rendezvous at New∣castle  and was there on that day accompanied by his Nobles and an army of foot and heavy armed horsemen besides the small army belonging to the Bishop of Durham consisting of foot and horse  In the year the English army was ordered to muster at New∣castle to proceed against the Scotch when there assembled heavy armed horsemen light horse and above foot  In the beginning of May King Edward II being at Newcastle with his favourite Gaveston Lancaster the Lords H Percy and Robert Clifford in association with many other Nobles accompanied by nu∣merous attendants came by surprize upon them intending to take the devoted Minion even from the embraces of the Sovereign but they made their escape to Tynemouth and from thence by sea to Scar∣brough where Gaveston being left by the King as in a place of the utmost security he was besieged by Lord Pembroke and others and obliged to surrender upon stipulated terms but Lancaster Hereford and Arundel the heads of the junto not approving of the submission Lord Pembroke had accepted they seized Gaveston and put him to death as a traitor  In Gaveston's baggage left behind him in his precipitate retreat were found many jewels which belonged to the Crown and of which an exact inventory was taken They were re∣stored to the King after Gaveston was beheaded  Rapin  The whole militia of England by advice of a parliament held at Lincoln were ordered to rendezvous at Newcastle King Edward II in order to proceed on a Scotch expedition every village in the kingdom sent one stout man with armour and travelling money as also wages at d per day during the service  Bourne in a note to the year says  there was a grievous fa∣mine and mortality insomuch that the quick could hardly bury the dead and a great corruption of cattle and grass Some eat the flesh of their own children and thieves in prison devoured those that were newly brought in and greedily eat them half alive  In the year King Edward having sustained the most disgraceful defeats and disappointments in Scotland a congress of Commissioners  was agreed to be held at Newcastle on the th of December when a truce for two years was concluded  Four Conservators were appointed for Northumberland  A congress was held here at Candlemas in order to establish the terms of reconciliation between the nations Besides the conserva∣tors of the truce for England and Scotland there were present as aids and mediators two Envoys from Philip King of France and two Nuncios from the Holy See but each party insisting on rigorous articles the congress broke up without effecting any thing  In October King Edward II was at Newcastle where he ren∣dezvoused a great army and therewith marched from thence to relieve Norham Castle that was then besieged by the forces of King Robert Bruce but the country being naked and the Scotch having driven their cattle and flocks into the mountains and strongholds King Edward in his progress into Scotland lost many men by famine  Walsingham  A peace was concluded upon here between England and Scotland in the year by the Commissioners of King Edward II and King David Bruce for years Among the English Commissioners were Adomar Earl of Pembroke and Hugh de Spencer Lord High Cham∣berlain Among those from Scotland the Bishop of St Andrew's and the Earl of Murray  In Nov th the Commissioners of both nations met at New∣castle and concluding a truce such preliminaries for a settled peace were agreed upon as were deemed worthy a parliamentary considera∣tion and accordingly a parliament was summoned to assemble at York at Candlemas following in which was given the memorable recognition of the right of Robert Bruce and his heirs to the Crown of Scotland and the renunciation of all claim and right to the dominion or sove∣reignty of the kingdom by King Edward III and his successors Kings of England and that the said kingdom should be held for ever divided and distinct from the kingdom of England and in all respects inde∣pent of it and to that end all writings and evidences to the contrary should be deemed null and void and on the part of King Robert Bruce l was stipulated to be paid by Scotland in three yearly pay∣ments to King Edward's officers at Tweedmouth  In King Edward III remitted to the Burgesses of Newcastle all debts and arrears due to him or his progenitors  Mador Firm Burg  King Edward III having placed Edward Baliol on the throne of Scotland kept his Whitsuntide A D at Newcastle with great splendour and magnificence In the month of June in quality of So∣vereign Lord of Scotland he received there in a public and solemn manner the fealty and homage of the Scotch King at the same time Baliol ceded to him large Scotch territories in satisfaction of the ex∣pences sustained in restoring the Crown to him as its hereditary claim∣ant By the following passage in Lel Col vol I p it appears that greater cessions were made by Baliol  And this Edwarde Baillol condescendid with Eduarde King of England after that he had done the accustomid services that if he died without heyres the realme of Scotlande should remayne to King Edwarde of England and his heyres for ever And this pact was made at Newcastle upon Tyne  Through the interposition of the King of France Edward consented to a truce with David Bruce's party who had opposed Edward Baliol on the expiration of which about Midsummer both Kings held their rendezvous at Newcastle with a powerful army preparatory to their entry into Scotland  In the year King Edward met the Scotch Delegates at New∣castle when he acceded to proposals made by the Pope's Nuncio for a further time of truce  In it was granted that no goods be sold until a plank be laid to the ship on forfeiture of the goods  In David King of Scots having committed horrid ravages on his march through Northumberland came before Newcastle with a powerful army amounting in numbers as some authors insist to foot and horse John Lord Nevil who commanded in the castle made a sally with chosen lancemen who entering the Scotch camp surprized the Earl of Murray one of the chief in command in bed and dragged him forth naked returning to the castle with their pri∣soner  and much booty not having lost one man The Scotch enraged at the disgrace began a fierce but irregular attack and were repulsed with great slaughter The bravery of the garrison induced David to raise the siege and march towards Durham which city he took by storm and with the most savage barbarity put the inhabitants to the sword without distinction of age sex or condition  Barns's Hist King Edward III  In Newcastle furnished ships and mariners for the siege of Calais a force superior to that provided by any northern port in England but Yarmouth

two sons viz Sir Henry and Sir Ralph to Newcastle to which place the county were appointed to come where∣upon ensued several light skirmishes betwixt the English and them  and many proper feats of arms done Amongst others there fought hand to hand the Earl Douglas and Sir Henry Percy and by force of arms the Earl won Sir Henry's penon Whereupon Sir Henry and all the English were sore displeased the Earl saying to him Sir I shall bear this token of your prowess into Scotland and shall set it on high on my castle of Alquest that it may be seen afar off which so provoked the Percys that after divers bold adventures against the Scotch forces at length they obtained the victory and slew the Earl James Douglas but Sir Ralph Percy was therein wounded and taken prisoner by a Scotch Knight

attacked it vigorously on two sides at once The Marquis of Newcastle then Governor for the King maintained the place though the enemy gained part of the outworks and some un∣fortunate sallies were made In the succeeding year the Scots took it by storm Sir John Merlay then Mayor retired to the castle with about men which he held till terms of capitulation were obtained The inhabitants saved the town from being plundered by payment of a large sum of money The Parliament disfranchised the body corporate and ordered the Mayor to be tried by a court martial Sir Henry An∣derson  one of the Representatives in Parliament was expelled the House for joining the royal army The town at the time of these ca∣lamities was also visited by the plague  In the year the King came from Lumley Castle in the county of Durham and put himself under the protection of the Scotch General Leven  A sermon was preached before him by the Scotch Metropolitan who was so little touched with the presence of suffering Majesty and had so little a portion of the grace of modesty that after his discourse was ended he called for the d psalm which begins "Why dost thou tyrant boast thyself thy wicked works to praise" His Majesty that moment stood up and called for the th psalm which begins "Have mercy Lord on me I pray for men would me devour The congregation sung his Majesty's  Clarendon  Whilst they

houses remained for some time suspended in an amazing manner over a dreadful chasm sustained by the compact∣ness of its materials and its timber and clinging by a small part of its foundation on one of the piers from which the arch was broken down  From thence the miserable inhabitants looked on the raging waters and the horrid ruins with distraction and sent forth cries of despair to mul∣titudes  of spectators who could not lend them aid At length the fatal moment arrived that closed the tremendous spectacle the house with its inhabitants sunk and were swallowed up in the destructive torrent  The ancient bridge was of wood and in the d year of the reign of King Henry III was destroyed by fire The late bridge was con∣structed of stone and consisted of arches three of which on the north were closed up and used as cellars It was built about years ago Walter Kirkham  He came to the See  Bishop of Durham being a great contributor thereto  The original superstructure of this bridge was probably of wood like that over the Danube and continued made with the same material for several centuries Notice is taken of it in the reign of King Richard I when Philip Poictiers Bishop of Durham gave licence to the Bur∣gesses of Gateshead to give wood to whomsoever they pleased to be spent about the river Tyne which is supposed to mean in the repairs of the bridge and quay on the part belonging to Dur∣ham for one third belongs to the Bishop and two to the town so that after it was destroyed in by a furious fire the Bishop and the town united in the expence of building the stone bridge of which this calamity was the origin The Prelate Walter Kirkham had the ad∣vantage in this for armed with spiritual powers he issued out indulgences from all penances to every one that would assist either with money or labour The town also applied to other Bishops for their assistance in promoting so good a work and they in consequence granted their indulgences but then the Clergy of the North were directed by their Archdeacon to prefer the indulgences of their own Prelate to any other In the end both parties succeeded and the money raised was given to Laurentius Master of the Bridge  Pennant vol p  It was crowded with buildings Near the middle was a tower with an iron gate which the Corporation used as a town prison This tower was of considerable service some years ago in preventing the further communication of a fire which consumed many houses ad∣joining it At the south end was formerly another tower and a drawbridge A blue stone near the middle of the bridge denoted the boun∣dary of the town's liberty the southern end of the bridge appertaining to the See of Durham In the year a claim of the Corporation to the whole bridge occasioned a suit in which the right of the Bishop of Durham to the southern part was established Thomas Ruthal Bishop of Durham in the reign of King Henry VII repaired the southern part  This part of the bridge was repaired by Thomas Ruthal Bishop of Durham famous in the reigns of King Henry VII and VIII not only for being the richest subject then in Britain but for the unfortunate mistake he made in delivering the book of his own private affairs to the aspiring Cardinal Wolsey instead of one he had wrote on the state of the kingdom by the desire of his Sovereign whereby the Cardinal effected his ruin and stepped into his Bishoprick  Wallis  A strong building crossed the bridge which was used as a magazine for the town On the south front was an elegant statue of King Cha II  with this motto  Adventus Regis Solamen Gregis  There was an open∣ing in the battlements of the bridge railed with iron for the conveni∣ence of passengers to look upon the river and shipping Mr Bourne re∣lates a story that from thence one  Anderson  an Alderman dropt his signet ring into the river that some time afterwards his own servant having bought a salmon for his table in opening the fish the ring was found in its intrails and was in his days in the custody of a descendant of Mr Anderson  Herodotus  gives an account of a similar circumstance happening to  Polycrates  King of  Samos  who was called  the favourite of Fortune  On the th of June the workmen began to pull down the west end of St Thomas's chapel in order to open the passage to the bridge  In the inundation th Nov the water was supposed to be at its height about seven in the morning and to have risen upwards of feet above high water mark in spring tides From Tyne Head in Aldston Moor to Shields was a continued scene of horror and devas∣tation  An act of parliament passed d June to enable the Bishop of Durham and his successors to raise a competent sum of money to be applied for the repairing improving or rebuilding such part of Tyne Bridge as belongs to the See of Durham  On the th June one Stephenson contracted to build a tem∣porary bridge over the Tyne in four months time under a great pe∣nalty which was performed  On Tuesday th April the first stone of the south pier of the new bridge within the boundaries of this Corporation was laid by Sir Matthew White Ridley Mayor  From the evidence of the ancient name of Pons Aelii and the Roman road from Chester leading thereto it is conjectured that the Romans had a bridge here  Mr Pennant is of opinion  that part of the Roman bridge remained till the late inundation for from the observation of workmen upon the old piers those as well as the piers of the bridge at Bywell seem originally to have been formed without any springs for arches This  was a manner of building used by the Romans witness the bridge built over the Danube by Trajan at Severin whose piers he believes still exist Adrian was probably the founder of the bridge at New∣castle which was called after his family name Pons Aelii in the same manner as Jerusalem was styled Elia Capitolina and the games he instituted at Pincum in Maesia Aeliana Pincensia The coins disco∣vered on pulling down some of the piers in confirm my opinion Several were discovered but only three or four rescued from the hands of the workmen All of them are coins posterior to the time of Adrian probably deposited there in some later repairs One of them is a beautiful Faustina the Elder after her deification Her fore∣head is bound with a small tiara her hair full twisted and dressed  a la moderne  round is inscribed Diva Faustina On the reverse is  Ceres  with a torch in one hand and ears of corn in the other The inscription  Augusta S C  The next has the laureated head of  Antoninus Pius  On the reverse  Apollo  with a  patera  in one hand and a  plectrum  in the other the le∣gend so much defaced as to be illegible  The third is  Lucius Verus  like that of Faustina after consecration On the reverse is a magnificent funeral pile and the word  Consecratio S C  Within a little distance from Newcastle lies  JESMOND  A corruption of JesusMount  an ancient Hospital with a chapel appertaining to it dedicated to the Virgin Mary King Edward VI granted this place to the Corporation of Newcastle who sold it to Sir Robert Brandling The hospital is now used as a dwellinghouse and the chapel is converted into a stable  There was a well at Jesmond greatly resorted to by persons labour∣ing under infirmities for its salutary qualities It had as many steps down to it as there are articles in the Creed Many pilgrimages were made to Jesmond to visit the shrine of the Virgin and to partake of the miraculous virtues of the sanctified spring The superstition of paying reverence to salubrious springs seems to be derived from the Romans  In the first year of the reign of King Henry VIII a mob headed by several of the Aldermen and principal inhabitants of Newcastle assem∣bled here with intent to slay the Prior of Tinemouth The cause of this outrage my author doth not mention  Bourne notes p  From the same authority it appears that soon after Jesmond became the property of Mr Coulson he enclosed the well and converted it into a bath but in a short time the water forsook the well which a∣larmed the superstitious much But whilst the cry against this pro∣fanation was warmest the waters returned and the miracle was washed away  ELSWICK  is about a mile west from  Newcastle  the seat of  John Hodgson  Esq  formerly part of the possessions of the  manastery of Tynemouth  Soon after the dissolution it

a few years ago in a field east of the house the pave∣ment was not in chequer work or Mosaic but in unequal irregular figures red and white a composition of  Caluviva  and brick resembling a pebble marble Of the true Musive or Mosaic I have not heard of any yet being discovered in the Roman structures of this or the other stations with us though I make no question but the Romans of quality had them here as well as in the more southern stations of Britain They are of great antiquity invented by the luxurious  Asiatics  the builders of  Babylon  of  Palmyra  of  Persaepolis  of the famous  Piramids  of  Memphis  the just wonders of the world At  Susa  they had a royal banquet on a  Lythostraton  composed of rich and curious stones Esther Ch I At  Jerusalem  our Sa∣viour had his sentence passed on him by Pilate from a throne in a place called by way of eminence  the Pavement  From  Asia  these  Lythostrata  passed into  Greece  from  Greece  to  Rome  The first made at  Rome  was in the temple of  Fortune  laid by  Sylla  years before the christian aera  From  Rome  they came to  Britain  into the palaces of Princes the state rooms and tents of Generals the sacred temples magnificent  thermae  and other places of elegance and plea∣sure The  Balnaeum  and  Lithostraton  according to  Varro  made a compleat and elegant  villa Baths  and  shady piazzas  were first introduced here by  Agricola  Two  millstones  were found here one of ragstone the other factitious of potters work A small  golosum fictile  or drinking cup of Roman pottery and the neck and handle of a  cruise  of brown pottery unglazed  Wallis  Benwell was the  Condercum  of the Romans  In Mr Horsley's works the following Roman Antiquities found at this station are mentioned  No VII  Jovi Optimo Maximo Dolicheno et Numinibus Augusti prosalute Imperatoris Caesaris Titi Aelii Hadriani Augusti Pii patris patriae et legionis secundae Augustae Marcus Liburnius Fronto Centurio Legionis ejusdem votum solvit libens merito  Between  Cousins  House and  Benwell  I could not meet with any Roman inscriptions or sculp∣tures I never heard of any found at  Newcastle  nor is this much to be wondered at con∣sidering how large a town it has long been and how easy it is to suppose that all that was Roman has been lost some ages ago amongst such numerous buildings I therefore proceed to the inscriptions at  Benwell  There are three belonging to this fort of which this and the next have been published only I think by Mr Gordon That part of the two first lines which is lost in the break of the stone is so supplied by Mr Gordon as if the whole had been  Jovi Optimo Maximo et numinibus c  and as if the words  Optimo Maximo  had been wrote at large so as to fill up the whole vacancy but these words are seldom found at length upon an altar and will by no means consist with the letters  HENO  which are very plain and distinct The reading I have given seems to answer as to the letters and to fill up the space with the greatest exactness and it will be hard to find another word into which the letters  HENO  will enter nor is there any occasion to search for any other since  Jupiter Dolichenus  had not only several altars dedicated to him in other places but one or two likewise in  Britain Caesar  in the short Natural History he gives of  Britain  tells us  "The inland countries afford tin and the mari∣time iron tho' no great plenty of it"  This passage of  Caesar  may give us some light into the reason of these altars being dedicated to  Jupiter Dolichenus  when compared with another inscription to the same deity published by  Reinesius  and referred to in  Camden  The inscription is this  Jovi Op∣timo Maximo Dolycheno ubi Ferrum nacitur Sempronius Rectus Cent Frumentarius D D  Reine∣sius thinks  Jupiter  had this name given him from  a town of  Epirus  or  Macedonia  which country  Strabo  represents as rugged and mountainous and productive of metals among which  Reinesius  supposes there was  iron  If this was the case though  Strabo  I think does not men∣tion  iron  the words  ubi serrum nascitur  may seem to intimate that  Jupiter Dolichenus  had some particular concern in  iron mines  and so might well be applied to for assistance and con∣duct by those who entertained hopes of making beneficial discoveries in that way now  Ben∣well  is not many miles from the sea and this country abounds with mines of coal that bring yearly a very large sum of money into it and the Romans from Caesar's account and other circumstances might expect to find  iron mines  in these parts and upon that occasion pay their devotion to  Jupiter Dolichenus Montsaucon  has given us one image of this deity found at  Marseilles  clad in armour and standing upon a  bull  which seems to agree very well with this account but another image represents him in a rustic habit with an  ox  under him and  Stephanus  who calls him  derives his name from  Dolochene  a city of  Camma∣gene  in  Asia  which  Strabo  describes as a fruitful country well planted with  trees  and  vines  it is not unlikely therefore he might be worshipped at both these places and that the words in  Reinesius's  inscription  ubi Ferrum nascitur  might be designed as descriptive of the  Graecian Deity  it may not be improper to remark that there is a coalry not far from  Benwell  a part of which is judged by those that are best skilled in such affairs to have been wrought by the Ro∣mans The  Legio Secunda Augusta  for whose preservation together with that of the Emperor this altar was erected must at this time have been upon the wall in Northumberland which very probably if  Pausanius's  account be true might be after they had defeated the  Brigantes  and taken from them a great part of their land  The words which I read  Centurio Legionis ejusdem  are by Mr Gordon read  legatus ejusdem  which mistake he seems to have been led into by not observing the  centurial mark  so that here is no foundation to suppose a new  Propraetor  or  Lieutenant M Liburnius Fronte  from this in∣scription this curious altar has on one side  the sacrificing knife and ax  on the other side both the  Patera  and  Praeferi  ulum  This and the following were in the collection of  Robert Shaft    Esq  No VIII  Centurio Legionis vicestmae valentis victricis votum solvil libens merito  This is an imperfect inscription upon the lower part of a broken altar found in the same place with the preceding and as that was erected by a centurion of the second Legion called  Augusta  so this by another such officer of the  twentieth Legion  called  Valens Victri    the mark for the  Centurion  is very plain and distinct upon the stone though omitted by  Mr Gordon  nor do I remember an instance in Britain of an altar erected by a  whole Legion  though it was fre∣quently done by a  Cohort  My reason for reading  Valens Victrix  and not  Valeria or Valeriana  I have given before  No IX  Victoria August  r  Nostrorum secit Nepot Softi Senecionis consulis Felix alae primae Asterum Praefectus  I first discovered this inscription on the side wall of a house at  East Denton  which village stands upon the wall about a quarter of a mile west from  Benw  ll Fort  The house was after∣wards demolished and this stone thrown among the dirt and rubbish but being again reco∣vered by a curious gentleman of my acquaintance is now in my possession Tho' the word  secit  as synonimous with  p  sant  is frequently applied to an altar or monument and therefore does not certainly prove that the legion was at this time employed in building the wall or the  val∣la    yet as no person is named in the inscription to whose honour this monement was erected the word  fecit  may possibly refer to some other work than purely setting up such a stone and to none more likely than building that part of the wall but this I have considered in its pro∣per place It is somewhat rare and curious to have the name of the  legion  and the number of the  cohort  set down both together so distinctly as here There are some other parallel in∣stances of legionary cohorts in Britain but not very many In a memorandum left by the late  Dr W  dward  f  Cre  a  n  e  this stone is s  d to have been found on the Roman Wall near  Newcastle upon Tyre  and to have been sent to him by  Dr Ca  of that town The monument correspondents so exact▪ to the description I had from an eyewitness of one found at  Benwell Fo  t  and preferred for some  re at  Benwell  se  that there can remain no doubt but it must be the very  me I am told it was first presented by the present  Mr Shasto  's grandmother during the mi  or  y of the late  Mr Shafto  at  Benwell  to the late  Dr Ca    a learned and cu∣rious Physician of  Newcastle  by whom it was transmitted to London since the death of  Dr Woodwa    and the  posal of h  s co  es  in  in which I saw it it is now in the possession of  Mr West  The distinct mention ma  e  th  s monument of the  Ala prima Astorum  renders it highly curious and valuable as it c  nfr  the Roman town and fort upon the wall at  Benwell∣  to be the ancient  Cond  rcu    the third station  per  neam Val  i  where according to the  No∣titia  this  Ala  was in garrison I was agreeably surprized at the sight of it because it is a fur∣ther confirmation of the scheme I had advanced concerning these stations I was also pleased to discover the small  o  at the end of the last line which is sufficiently distinct and certain and proves the word to be  Astorum  not  Asturum  in which it agrees with the  Notitia  That part of the stone which is near the  M  in the bordering is imperfect and broken I make no doubt but the letters  RV  have been before the  M  and that it is to be read  Astorum  the  PRA  on the other side can be nothing else but  Praefectus  there is no appearance left of any cross strokes of the  E  after  Ala  in the last line but as these may have been worn out I am of opinion that it was at first  ALAE  and that the monument was set up by  Felix  the commander of this  Ala  it seems plainly to have been erected  Victoriae Augustorum  for the word  Victoriae  is compleat and distinct the upper parts of the two  G G  are yet visible and  Dr Woodward  had put a  V  before them in his copy though I could not discern any vestige of it on the stone I suppose a stroke or two in the next letters are now effaced and that they were originally a double  N  conjoined for  nostrorum  and whosoever considers the frequent va∣riation of letters we often meet with in the same monument won't think it strange that the first stroke is more oblique here than in one or two instances of the same letter afterwards the letters  F E  at the end of this line must in all probability stand for the word  Fecit  If my reading be allowed the monument must have been erected by  Felix  who was the grandson of  Socius Se∣necio  the consul and the commander of the first wing of the  Asti Mr Ward  chuses to read the third and fourth lines thus  Numerius Sosius Senecio Nepos Consulis Felix  The letter  N  put for a  praenomen  signifies  Numerius  according to  Diomedes Sosius  was one of the consuls names who is called  G Sosius Senecio  in the  Fasti Consulares  and  N  for  Nepos  is very common upon inscriptions as to the situation of the words  Nepos Consulis  'tis usual in inscriptions to insert such words as express any relation or other circumstance of those who erect them before the last name but  N S  in  Goltzins  is made to stand for  Numerius  as well as  N  alone This being admitted we may read  Numerius Senecio Nepos Consulis Felix  but I much incline to the reading that I have given which occurred to me at the first 'tis evident that no regard is had in this inscription to the usual order of the words in others there seems rather to be an af∣fected singularity as to this matter  Senecio  who is mentioned in an inscription or two found at  Brugh  in  Richmondshire  the originals of which are now lost was probably of the same family though rather too late to be the same person with him who is described in this monu∣ment for he as appears from these inscriptions I have referred to lived under the reign of  Commodus  and continued at least till the joint reign of  Severus  and  Caracalla  is later than a grandson of  Sosius Senecio  the consul can well be supposed to have lived for  Sosius Senecio  was the fourth and last time consul in conjunction with  Licinius Sura  in the year under the reign of  Trojan  from whence to the beginning of the joint reign of  Severus  and  Caracalla  is little less than a  century  for the same reason it is not so probable that the two Emperors here intended are  Severus  and  Caracalla  but rather  Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus  who as well as the others carried on a war with success against the  Britons  and  Calpurnius Agricola  was their  Legate  whose name we meet with in some inscriptions found near the Roman wall and as he began to reign jointly above thirty years before the other two that time suits better than the other so that upon the whole I take this monument to have been erected to the honour of the Emperors  Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus  upon occasion of some victory they had gained over the northern  Britons  by  Calpurnius Agricola  their  Legate  in which this  Felix Senecio  had the command of the first wing of the  Asti  The  Asti  according to  Pancirollus  were the inhabitants of the  Asta  a colony in  Ligu  ia Asta  is mentioned by  Pliny  and others no doubt they were distinct from the  Astures  a people of  Spain  The four inscriptions which follow are on stones built up in the walls of houses in the village of  Benwell  No IX  Dis Manibus Aurelii clae primae Astorum  This is a funeral monument but imperfect and has been much abused I have given the best reading of it I could it is now built up in the front of  Mrs Lion's house  near the door There appears something like a stop after the  A  in the last line but yet I incline to read it  alae primae  and most probably  Astorum  for this was the only  ala primae  stationed on the principal line of the wall This seems to be of  the lower Empire  and more strongly proves this fort to be the ancient  Condercum  No IX  Centuria Peregtini  This of  Peregrinus  is now built up in the fore wall of the house of William Gill  No IX  Legionus secundae Augustae cohors decima  This is very useful and curious though it contains only the name of the  Legio secunda Augusta  and the number of the  Cohort  namely the  tenth  for this farther confirms what I had from other reasons and inscriptions conjectured before that this Legion was employed on the east end of the wall and this Cohort of that Legion in particular the  Sea Goat  and  Pegasus  at the top are not uncommon and seem to denote the maritime situation of the country on the one hand and the swiftness of the Roman victory on the other There is a branch in the upper part of the stone which was mistaken by a very learned Antiquary for a Roman  Vexillum  and we have a Roman  Vexillum  supported by a  Pegasus  and a  Sea Goat  at  Little Chesters  on the wall This stone is now in the fore wall of the house of  Joseph Wallis  near the door  No IX  Centuria Arrii  This of  Arrius  is in the back wall of the house of  Matthew Garret  both the stone and let∣ters are very coarse  Arrius  is a Roman name  Horace  has it once and again  No IX  Centuria Herenniani  This stone was found near the highway side by  Denton  and is now in my own possession  Herennius Herennianus  occurs in a remarkable inscription found in  Spain  and published in the Transactions The name on this stone is plainly  Herrennianus  This station on  Benwell Hill  has furnished a good many inscriptions but I remember not to have seen or heard of any  Roman coins  found here nor can I say in the general that Roman coins are so frequent in the stations on the wall as in some other places but  the fine urn  which they now preserve in  the Library at Durham  was found at this place The cut of the letters in the inscriptions belonging to  Benwell  is tolerably good and the inscriptions themselves are not so much perplexed with ligatures of letters as those of later dates often are though these are not wholly free from them But the most curious inscriptions have been removed out of this county many were carried off by  Sir Robert Cotton  several of which are yet remaining at  Connington  near  Stilton  in  Hantingdonshire  but they also are going to ruin for the summerhouse where they were carefully placed by  Sir Robert  being now uncovered and in a ruinous state the stones and inscriptions have already suffered very much  Mr Warburton  had made the largest collection who was at a great deal of pains and expence to collect the most curious Roman stones he could find in this county but he unhappily broke many of them in order to make them more portable and so carried off only that part of the stone which had the inscription by this means it has happened that many of the stones col∣lected by him are only faces of altars and in several instances the inscriptions themselves have suffered damage by this unhappy frugality What this gentleman had collected together at  Hexham  have since been removed to  the Library at Durham  Mr Warburton  in his  Vallum Romanum  justifies himself against this charge in the following manner  The editor in vindication of himself from this unjust accusation of a parsimonious incuriosity denies the charge in every part and as a proof of the truth thereof refers himself  to the draughts of the altars he discovered as the same are represented in the plates That the Romans frequently broke and defaced altars on particular occasions is evident and is usually observed to have been practised on Revolutions in the Empire or upon a persons falling into disgrace who is mentioned in the inscription  Observations  on the inscriptions near  Walbottle  The three following are at a place upon the wall called  Walbottle  No X  Centuria Mucieni Posuit  This is Centurial and is now in the sore wall of a cowhouse in this village it contains nothing distinct but the character and name of the  Centurion  No XI  Cohors octava Posuit  This contains only the number of the  Cohort  I believe there never has been any thing more inscribed on it and am apt to think it was the  eighth Cohort  of the  Legio secunda Augusta  the same as that before in the inscription at  East Denton  No XII The inscriptions contained under this number are only some obscure and doubtful remains of numeral letters The two first viz V and IX have most probably been and denoting the numbers of the  Cohorts  they are in the corner of the stone wall through which a small brook passes a little west from the town and of the same sort with these are the rest but placed in several parts of the inside of the wall which incloses the field There were two or three more of the same sort and size with No I upon them and another also with No V besides those which I have described  the distinct remains of the station appear on  Benwell Hill  The observations made thereon and the course of the wall from  Newcastle  to  Rutchester  by Mr Horsley  and Mr Warburton are to the following effect No appearance of either of the Roman walls can be expected as far as the buildings of  Newcastle  extend but as soon as they are well ended some feint ves∣tiges  of both or of what has belonged to them begin to shew them∣selves for just at the end of  Westgate  on the south side of the highway Hadrian's Ditch seems pretty visible and near the  Quarry House  some  feint marks of the Ditch and north Agger begin to appear but chiefly of the latter and this state of the Vallum extends to  Benwell Fort  As to Severus's Wall little or nothing relating to it can be discovered be∣tween  the town and the Quarry House some visible remains of a cas∣tellum are discoverable just behind the Quarry House and the line of the wall appeared to go through the midst of the house The castellum is conveniently placed for prospect and is the only one that is visible between  Newcastle  and the next station by the distance there should have been another but it is quite demolished From the  Quarry House  to  Elswick  Windmill Severus's wall is difficult to trace but from thence to the fort on  Benwell Hill  the appearance of the ditch is fre∣quently very distinct and the track of wall which keeps much upon the high road pretty certain  From the station at  Newcastle  which is placed by these Antiquaries near the castle to  Benwell Hill  is near two miles and a furlong and no inscriptions have been discovered in this space at least none now remain nor even the remembrance of any  The situation of the station on  Benwell Hill  is high and the prospect considerable the ramparts are large and distinct but the ditch scarce to be discerned Hadrian's vallum seems to have fallen in with the south side of it and Severus's wall strikes upon the east and west sides so as to leave three chains to the north and six to the south but there is no appearance of the wall and its ditch being continued through the fort though  Mr Gordon  has so represented it There are stones in the road that now crosses this fort but these seem only to have been taken  out of the ruins to repair the highway This station falls in course to be  Condercum  the name given in the  Notitia  to be the third in the se∣ries where the  Ala Prima Astorum  was quartered  From the station at  Benwell Hill  Severus's wall and ditch in going down to  Denton  continue much in the same state as before but Ha∣drian's work on this side begins to appear more conspicuous both the walls pass to the north of the hill and village of  Benwell  from  Denton  to the  Chapel Houses  both the walls and their ditches are almost all the way visible and distinct overagainst  West Denton Hall  there seemed to be the visible remains of a castellum and somewhat like the ruins of a Turret not very far from it  Near the  Chapel Houses  about a furlong south from Severus's wall and less from Hadrian's are somewhat like the ruins of a rampart it is called  the Castle Steads  the name usually given to those castella that are regularly placed along Severus's wall but this besides its being at some distance from the wall which the others never are appears to have been of a quite different form and dimensions for it is about four chains long with an interval in the middle that looks like a gate and so makes it appear very like the south rampart of a small fort but if there have been ramparts on the other sides no traces of them ap∣pear at present The prospect here especially to the south is very con∣siderable perhaps it has been an exploratory tower belonging to Ha∣drian's work and prior to Severus's and so neglected in his time The usual castellum belonging to Severus's wall is about a furlong west from the  Chapel Houses  and visible there so that the other can neither be one of these nor intended to supply the place of one From the name  Chapel Houses  one would expect to find some ruinous  chapel  there and I should have suspected somewhat of these ruins to have been of that nature if the name  Castle Steads  had not determined against it  From  Chapel Houses  to  Wallbottle  both walls and ditches are pretty visible and continue so to  Newburn Dean  but on the descent from the  Chapel Houses  to  Wallbottle  Hadrian's north Agger becomes very con∣spicuous and holds so for the most part to  Newburn Dean  Between  Wallbottle  and this  Dean  is a castellum still very visible and from the Dean to  Throcklow  Hadrian's vallum and ditch are discernible but not very large and Severus's wall not quite so plain  Overagainst  Throcklow  in a convenient high place there seems to be the ruins of another castellum but near the village the vallum is very obscure From  Throcklow  to  Heddon on the Wall  Severus's wall and ditch are very conspicuous and Hadrian's vallum and ditch near as visible The north Agger is also discernible for part of the way and near  Heddon  it is very considerable Before we come to  Heddon  there is on the north side of the wall another place of the same nature with that at  Chapel Houses  and called likewise  Castle Steads  The re∣mains are very confused and as it is altogether on the north of the wall and detached a little from it it seems to be a castellum erected prior to the wall and neglected after the building of it The prospect from this place is very good which makes it the more likely to have been of the exploratory kind However there seems to have been an usual castellum in Severus's wall very near to these ruins which is a further proof that the other has not been used after the wall was erected It seems to have been twice as large as one of Severus's cas∣tella and yet not large enough for a station Three sides the north east and west may be traced out but the other is entirely levelled  HEDDON  commonly called  Heddon on the Wall  was part of the barony of Hugh de Bolbeck who gave the appropriation and advowson of the church here to the Abbey of Blanchland  In Nov the workmen employed in making the military road which leads from Carlisle found a great number of curious Roman coins and medals in the ruins of the Roman wall here They had been deposited in wood boxes which were almost decayed several of the medals were fresh and fair as if but newly struck some of them are of silver but most part of copper and mixt metal They are thought to be as valuable a collection as has been discovered for some centuries past  Near  Heddon on the Wall  somewhat appears like Severus's military way pretty near to his wall but it is rather probable this appearance is nothing but the stones and ruins of the wall and that the military ways have here coincided because the north Agger is so large though in a ploughed field not far from this place there have been some re∣markable  Tumuli  The village  Heddon Lawes  which stands upon a  hill has no doubt had its name from such  Tumuli  There is yet re∣maining one very great heap of stones besides other  Tumuli  and a re∣markable one farther to the east called  Dewly Lawe  with a smaller one near it The whole hill is like the ruins of a quarry but curious and worth the seeing If regard be had to the distance of miles from the sea  Heddon on the Wall  would seem to be Bede's VILLA AD MURUM and not either  Wall's End  or  Wall Town  From  Heddon  to  Rutchester  both the walls and their ditches are dis∣tinct and a little before we come to  Rutchester  Hadrian's north Agger is distinct Here is another castellum the remains of which are very visible and an oval fort though it seems not to be Roman near it The whole distance between the station at  Benwell Hill  and this at  Rutchester  is six measured miles and three quarters in this space there are six visible castella in a series without interruption and the constant exact measure between them is six furlongs and three quar∣ters and the whole distance between the two stations six measured miles and three quarters the two castella that have been next the fort at  Benwell Hill  have no visible remains  We passed in view of  Denton Hall  a seat of the ancient family of  Montagues  to  NEWBURN  a borough given by King John to Robert son of Roger de Clavering Baron of Warkworth John the last Lord Clavering having granted the reversion of it to the Crown in the th year of the reign of King Edward I it was given to Henry Lord Percy by King Edward III in the second year of his reign and is now part of the possessions of his Grace the Duke of Northumberland The village is chiefly inhabited by Miners The impropriation and advowson of the church of New∣burn was given by King Henry I together with St Nicholas in New∣castle to the Church and Canons of St Mary in Carlisle The church is in the form of a

amongst the poor inhabitants of the four following parishes To Newburn l to Heddon on the Wall l to Stamfordham l and to Ponteland l  Newburn was a place of consequence and note preceding the con∣quest Copsi who was created Earl of Northumberland by King William was put to death here Osulf the preceding Governor expelled by the Conqueror to give place to Copsi being forced into the woods and de∣serts lay concealed till he had collected a few hardy troops with these he besieged Copsi and at length obliged him to take refuge in the church Osulf disregarding all veneration for things sacred when put in competition with his desperate fortune and revenge set fire to the holy pile and as Copsi endeavoured to shun the flames he was seized and his head severed on the spot  At this village on the th of August King Charles I A D Lord Conway with an army of foot and horse opposed the passage of the Scots over the river Tyne led by Lesley  In Rushworth's Historical Collections there is a very particular relation of this affair p  On the twenty seventh of Aug in the forenoon his Majesty received intelligence from the Lord Conway that the Scots would that night be near Newcastle with their army craving his Majesty's pleasure and directions about the disposing of his army to the interrup∣tion of the march of the Scots  The King immediately called the Gentry of Yorkshire then at York together to wait upon his Majesty to whom the Earl of Strafford made a speech presently after he prepared a pacquet to be sent post to the Lord Conway then understanding the Scots were come near Newcastle and the author of these Collections being newly come post from London to York and hearing a pacquet was about to be sent to Newcastle took the opportunity to bear the messenger company therewith but when the author and the messenger with the pacquet came to Newcastle upon the th of August in the morning they were informed that the Lord Conway was gone to the army near Newburn whither we went immediately and found the Lord Conway and the Field Officers at a Council of War at Stella half a mile dis∣tant from the army and delivered the Lord Conway the pacquet which being opened it contained special orders to prepare the army for an engagement with the Scots Whilst  they were in debate in this matter an Herald came in all haste from the army to acquaint the Lord Conway and Council of War that the army was already engaged with the Scots which seemed strange to them because orders were given not to fight but upon the defence  On the th of August  The Scots pitched their tents on Heddon Law above Newborne from whence there went a continued descent to the river of Tyne In the night time they made great fires in and round about their camp on an open moorish ground having coals plenty thereabouts so that the camp seemed to be of large compass and extent  That night and the next morning they suffered any Englishman to come into their camp and made them welcome with expressions of great love and protestations of doing harm to none but those who should oppose them in demanding justice of the King against incendiaries  The same night part of the King's army consisting of foot and horse were drawn forth into a plain meadow ground which was near a mile in length close on the south side of Tyne called Newborne Haugh or Stella Haugh to hinder the Scots from pas∣sing the river in the night time where were two several sconces or breastworks raised by the English against the two fords which the Scots might pass over at low water for 'till then they could not pass the Tyne and into each sconce were put four hundred musqueteers and four pieces of ordinance  The horse were drawn into squadrons in the said Haugh at some distance from the foot in this posture horse and foot guarded the river all that night and the next day till the engagement  The Scots all the forenoon watered their horses at one side of the river and the English on the other side without affronting one another or giving any reproachful language  The Scots having the advantage of the rising ground above Newborne easily discerned the posture and motion of the English army below in the valley on the south side the river but the posture of the Scots army the English could not discern by reason of the houses hedges and inclosures in and about Newborne The Scots brought down cannon into Newborne town and planted some in the church steeple a small distance from the river Tyne their mus∣queteers were placed in the church houses lanes and hedges in and about Newborne  The skirmish began thus as the author of these Collections was informed being then upon the place a Scottish officer well mounted having a black feather in his hat came out of one of the thatcht houses in Newborne and watered his horse in the river Tyne as they had done all that day an English soldier perceived he fixed his eye towards the Eng∣lish trenches on the south side of the river fired at him whether in earnest or to fright him is not known but wounded the Scotchman with the shot who fell off his horse where∣upon the Scottish musqueteers immediately fired upon the English and so the fight begun with small shot but was continued with great shot as well as small  The Scots played with their cannon upon the English breastworks and sconce the King's army played with their cannon to beat the Scots out of the church steeple thus they con∣tinued firing on both sides 'till it grew to be near low water and by that time the Scots with their cannon had made a breach in the greater sconce which Colonel Lunsford com∣manded wherein many of his men were killed and began to retire yet the Colonel prevailed with them to stand to their arms but presently after a Captain a Lieutenant and some other officers were slain in that work then the soldiers took occasion to complain that they were put upon double duty and had stood there all night and that day to that time and that no soldiers were sent from the army at Newcastle to relieve them but Col Lunsford again prevailed with them not to desert their works but another cannon shot hitting in the works amongst the souldiers and killing some more of them they threw down their arms and would abide in the fort no longer  The enemy on the rising ground above Newbourne plainly discerned the posture of the King's army and how the souldiers had quit the great work and being low water the Scots commanded a forlorn party of horse being gentlemen of the College of Justice Troop to pass the river which they did with some swiftness their orders were only to make discovery in what posture the souldiers were about the uppermost work but not to come to close engagement but fire at a distance and retreat  The Scots playing at this time very hard upon the furthermost trench forced the English  foot to retreat from that work also which the Scots discerning on the rising ground at Newborne commanded by Sir Thomas Hope and two regiments of foot commanded by the Lord Craford Lindsey and Lord Lowdon waded through the river and General Lesley at this instant of time played hard with nine pieces of cannon from a new sconce which they had raised on a hill to the east and so galled the King's horse drawn up in plain meadow ground that it much disordered them and sending more forces over the river a retreat was sounded and Colonel Lunsford drew off the cannon Immediately Commissary Wil∣mot son to the Lord Wilmot Sir John Digby a Romish Recusant and Daniel O'Neal an Irishman jointly engaged the enemy and had a sharp encounter with their horse they being commanded to bring up the rear whilst the foot retreated up Ryton and Stella Banks but the Scots with their fresh supply newly come over the river environed these three com∣manders and took them and some others of their troops prisoners General Lesley treated these commanders nobly in the Scots camp and afterwards gave them their liberty freely to return to the King's army  In this engagement Cornet Potter son of Endymion Potter of the Bedchamber was slain and during the whole fight about men more as the Scots told us after the cessation of arms was agreed unto for the Scots buried the dead and afterwards they further told us that most of them that were killed lay about the works how many of the Scots were slain we know not  After this retreat the Lord Conway called a Council of War and it was there resolved at twelve at night that the whole army should retreat to Durham horse and foot and train of artillery and to quit Newcastle  The Scots  with great intrepidity passed the river breast deep in the face of the English army who were drawn up on the opposite banks Three hun∣dred Scotch horse were obliged to repass the river being opposed by a  body of foot covered by a breastwork but Lesley getting nine pieces of cannon  Said to have been concealed in some brushwood previous to the army fording the river  to play upon the English lines a panic seized the whole line of infantry they threw down their arms and fled with the utmost preci∣pitation leaving the horse under Commissary General Wilmot accom∣panied by many Gentlemen of rank exposed to the enemy's artillery and the united force of the whole body of Scots till overpowered by numbers and having sustained a loss of men and upwards they were obliged to retreat The foot were soon ashamed of their flight wishing to repair their disgrace and revenge it on a foe who hardly credited their own success but the timid General uninfluenced by the same sense of honour never afterwards turned his face to the enemy  Clarendon  Lord Clarendon calls this defeat an irreparable rout The General's conduct was inquired into on his coming to York where he told the story of his defeat to the King he was accused of cowardice and trea∣chery and though he used his utmost art to put a gloss upon his con∣duct  yet the strongest shew of conscious guilt was discoverable in his manners and the confusion of his language and countenance  Whitlock's Memoirs  I now repassed the Tyne and entered into the Bishopric of Durham  Having compleated my view of each

On the banks of Tweed excellent cattle are bred of which some have come to the weight of stone lb to the stone the ordinary cattle in the interior parts of the  country are of a middle size and mixed breed between Dutch and Scotch which are very beautiful and yield abundance of milk smaller cattle of the Highland kind are bred in the mountainous parts The  hills afford fine sheep walks and the flocks are numerous in some parts of the county of late years they have been much improved by the in∣troduction  of Leicestershire and Lincolnshire sheep by which cross the fleeces are become much better and the sheep feed to an improved weight Few of the large sheep are kept in this county  Improved husbandry makes a rapid progress and enclosures take place of the wide extended tracts where many Herdsmen were hereto∣fore necessarily employed to keep the cattle and flocks within their bounds  For so large a tract of land there are few considerable woods of tim∣ber trees and planting seems to proceed but languidly except in the vale of Whittingham and some other tracts where a laudable example has been given  The rivers abound with salmon and trout and the coasts with cod ling turbot soles place whitings haddocks crabs lobsters muscles and cockles  The great staple of Northumberland is coal By the following tables the importance of this county to the state at large will appear in its  exports and numbers of ships From that concise plan the produce is immediately deduced in all its articles of trade By the imports is  shewn how few foreign articles are wanted to contribute to the pleasures and luxuries of life other than those produced within its own limits  Exports at Berwick in the year  To foreign parts Corn qrs Salmon barrels  In the coast trade Wheat qrs Oats qrs

Customs prevail in this County the familiarity or outward insignificance of which occasion them to pass without much attention but as they are the strongest traditional memorials of antiquity I thought them worth collecting and present them to the Reader with some short Conjectures on their origin and the historical facts to which they have relation  Mr Bryant's words are  We talk indeed of ancient times and times of Antiquity but that time is most aged which has endured longest and these are the most ancient days in which we are ourselves conversant We enjoy now an age of accumulated experience and we are to make use of the helps which have been transmitted to dispel the mist which has preceded  Let∣ters have afforded the accumulation before their use the dissolution of every state was the dissipation of its science and wisdom arts and collective know∣ledge were destroyed with the empire in which they flourished and only a few scattered fragments and distracted ruins remained to save them from total oblivion By letters we possess the wisdom of all quarters of the earth times which have preceded their use left us chiefly traditional fragments scattered abroad in national customs and provincial names and phrases  In the course of this Collection I shall remark whatever Mr Bourne in his "Popular Antiquities" has noticed with some of the illucidations and judi∣cious constructions given by his late Editor the Rev Mr John Brand  BABBA  The common and most tender appellation of an infant is  Babba  This name Mr Bryant in his Analysis of ancient Mythology says is derived from the exclamation made by the congregation during the ceremony of purification by passing infants through the fire of Molock Fire worship was used in this country and in the Druidical rites such ceremony might be retained for they held many customs so similar to those of the Hebrews that it strengthens the idea greatly they were communicated by the Phoenecians or introduced from Germany where the Amonians most certainly were well known The Saxons also introduced their customs they were worshippers of fire and might hold such office of purification  GIFTS to INFANTS  Children when  st sent abroad in the arms of the nurse to visit a neigh∣bour are presented with an egg salt and fine bread The egg was a sacred emblem and seems a gift well adapted to infancy Mr Bryant says  An egg containing in it the elements of life was thought no improper emblem of the ark in which were preserved the rudiments of the future world hence in the Dionusiaca and in other mysteries one part of the nocturnal ceremony consisted in the consecration of an egg By this as we are in∣formed by Porphyry was signified the world It seems to have been a favourite symbol and very ancient and we find it adopted among many nations It was said by the Persians of Oromasdes that he formed mankind and inclosed them in an egg  Cakes and Salt were used in religious rites by the ancients The Jews probably adopted their appropriation from the Egyptians  And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour c  Lev ii  With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt  Ibid  There was a custom in the Romish church of making a cake in honour of the Holy Virgin's time of childbirth which was condemned by a canon in the Council of Trullus  Bou  P  p Antiq p  quoted Can Trul Bal  DOUBLING the THUMB  Children to avoid approaching danger are taught to double the thumb within the hand This was much practised whilst the terrors of witchcraft remained and even in the beginning of the present century much of those unhappy prejudices possessed the minds of the vulgar It was a custom to fold the thumbs of dead persons within the hand to prevent the power of evil spirits over the deceased the thumb in that position forming the similitude of the character in the Hebrew Alphabet which is commonly used to denote the name of God  NEW YEAR's DAY  The celebration of New Year's Day is preserved in this country as a rural festival Gifts are made to children servants and dependants called New Year's Gifts Mr Bourne quotes what Stillingfleet says  That among the Saxons of the northern nations the feast of the New Year was observed with more than ordinary jollity  and from Hospinian says  It was an ancient custom of the Heathens and afterwards practised by the Chris∣tians  Servants were exempt from their labour and partook of the feast and rural sports with their masters they were presented with tokens of appro∣bation and favour On certain festivals the Romans gave pieces of money to travellers and strangers who were present at the sacrifice On our day of festivity mirth is excited by a rustic masquerading and playing tricks in dis∣guise the hide of the ox slain for the winter cheer is often put on and the  person thus attired attempts to shew the character of the devil by every hor∣rible device in his power All the winter sports seem to express a strong opi∣nion of the ancients that Genii of very contrary natures prevailed on earth that the one was constantly concomitant to light as the other was to dark∣ness and this image of the devil which is frequently permitted to expel the inhabitants and take possession of the house is typical of the power of the evil genius in the season when the sun is longest absent from our hemisphere This corresponds with the lamentation used by those who held the Elusinian mysteries and mourned for Adonis It is very difficult to make any probable determination to what people we owe these customs In the Roman Saturnalia and Sigillaria this kind of frolicking was practised Among the observations made by Mr Brand on Bourne's XIV Chap he remarks that there was an ancient custom for young women to go about with a waffail bowl that is "a bowl of spiced ale" on New Year's Eve with some sort of verses that were sung by them in going from door to door Waffail is derived from the Anglo Sax  that is "Be in health"  TWELFTH DAY  The twelfth day after the day of our Saviour's birth is attended with great festivity There are diversions used in the southern parts of England which have not reached this northern county The mirth of the day here consists of feasting and a social intercourse between neighbouring families Mr Brand makes a happy quotation from Collier's Eccl Hist vol I p in his obser∣vations on Bourne's Chap XVII  In the days of King Aelfrid a law was made with relation to the holydays by virtue of which the days after the nativity of our Saviour were made festivals  So much as these feasts have been decried I cannot see them in the despicable light many modern authors have been pleased to place them They were the occasion of gathering neigh∣bours together in good humour with each other and the means of keeping them on terms of intimacy friendship and benevolence were thereby increased and good offices multiplied public matters at such times were discussed and amicably determined and those happy effects resulted which tended not only to the advantage of the individual but to the good of society at large This age is refined into insipidity few of the old hospitable days return sociability is sickened into unmeaning ceremony In ancient times the bard was brought to the festive hall to rehearse the Excellencies of our ancestors to fire the breast with emulation to inspire noble and bounteous sentiments and lift us through example into an adoption of the character of those heroes and men of honour from whom we were descended then it was the genial spirit was roused and benevolence prevailed The name of friendship is retained in our language and the real character is somewhere still found to exist but it is chiefly in middle life the great and opulent in general have little experience of it each apparently separates himself from community and is involved in his own circle The distinguishing characteristicks which in former days pur∣chased a man fortune and fame are become intrinsic trifles with which he  may amuse himself but purchase little patronage the vice is contaminating it is creeping into the vitals of lower life and where the insipidity will end is beyond modern magic to divine What would be the consequence should adverse ages ever bring on exigences of state The old popular influence of the great no longer existing the distances between ranks of men still extend∣ing their separation The celebrated fable points out the politics which would prevail with the lowest classes of men  If we are only to be regarded for servility it is indifferent to us to whom we are servants  There is nothing keeps this part of the state within rule but the fear of still worsning the condition  BLACK MAILE PAYMENT  This customary collection of money corn and cattle was taken away in consequence of the accession of King James I There was a law indeed made in the d year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth to restrain the Black Maile Payment and correct the enormities from whence it arose but whilst the contentions between the nations continued it had little effect This was a levy made within this county by the chieftains on the borders for protections against the depredations made by the robbers and spoiltakers afterwards called Moss Troopers The receivers were in league with the banditti  HEAD PENCE PAYMENT  This was an exaction made by the Sheriff of Northumberland amounting to l or more twice in seven years It was received for an exemption from attendance at the Sheriff's torn and thereupon the Lords of Manors held their leet where the suitors for their greater convenience were permitted to attend and make what in the law books is called their  Suit Royal  This exaction was totally surpressed by the Statute made in the d year of King Hen VI c  I have noticed these two obsolete customs because not only their names but also some memorials of them remain on the borders and in the moun∣tainous parts of the county  CANDLEMAS DAY  It is little noted in this county but by name Several religious rites were made peculiar to it in the Romish church In the quotation of St Gregory's Letter in the notes to p in the second volume of the work a reason is given for not abolishing the Pagan ceremonies in countries where conversion was taking place but it was commanded to adapt them to christian ceremo∣nies and this seems to carry with it a strong reason for the similarity there was in many of the ceremonies of the christian church in the first ages and the Pagan rites Mr Brand in his observations on Bourne's XIX chap from  Bacon's Reliques of Rome fo makes a quotation which informs us that the Romans in the service of their God Mars and his mother Februa made processions in the city of Rome with lighted torches the remains of which custom still existing with the vulgar in the time of Pope Sergius he com∣manded that it should be converted into an holy office of the christian church and that the congregation on the same day made their approach to the high altar with lighted tapers in honour of the Holy Virgin Those who sigh for the sanctity of the church in such reviews of her ceremonies must consider this was done to conciliate the minds of those long used in such spectacles and solemn shews and that an austerity which should at once have abolished such acts to which almost every mind was prejudiced would have greatly re∣tarded if not totally prevented the progress of conversion  St AGNES' FAST  It is not yet pointed out when or where this had its rise It is a fast kept by women desirous of dreaming of their lovers and thence to derive pro∣pitious indications touching wedlock It is the remains of the old super∣stition of divination but why fixed to the day of St Agnes is not to be accounted for  VALENTINE DAY  is an anniversary day of divination by lots It is a common saying that birds on this day choose their mates It may have relation to some domestic birds and also rooks and pigeons The custom now is that the names of young people are wrote on scrols of paper and each draws one confident that marriages are made in heaven and in full hope the lot of life will be pointed out What particular attention the allotted swain in former days was obliged to pay the fair one to whose hands his name had fallen I have not discovered Mr Brand in his observations on Bourne's XXth chap quotes a passage in Moresin to this purpose  That at this festival the men used to make the women presents as upon another occasion the women used to do to the men but that in Scotland on this day presents were reciprocal  Mr Pen∣nant speaks of this custom in Scotland by which young people try prognosti∣cations of their future fortunes in the nuptial state The first inventor of this custom must have been some benevolent female who studied to encourage the intercourse of the sexes for by such means intimacies might arise productive of love and marriage engagements or otherwise the first design of those lots was that those who shared in the dances and diversions might have their proper partners assigned without hazarding the confusion and displeasure which must necessarily arise in the liberty of choice  There was a religious sect of Valentinians but I find no ceremony used by them or tenet they embraced which could have any relation to these customs  SHROVE TIDE  It is particularly observed Shrove is derived from  Shrive  confession a preparation enjoined in the Romish church previous to the duties of Lent It was particularly prescribed that all offences should be mutually forgiven and reconciliation take place before they entered upon the solemnities of Lent and this was consequently a day of mutual intercourse and amity In several ancient Roman Catholic families the kitchen is opened and every neighbour and passenger is permitted to enter and fry a pancake for which the necessary provision is made ready This seems to be derived from a custom in the refectory of religious houses where the table was spread on this day for all pilgrims travellers and visitants In Newcastle Durham and other places the great bell of the church is tolled the servants have holyday and whoever partakes of the pancakes of the day must fry them a circumstance which occasions high kitchen mirth In the keeping of the vigils of all solemn days the ceremony began at noon The ringing of the great bell at noon was a signal to clear the larder of flesh meat from which time its use was prohibited In Mr Brand's Appendix to Bourne's Pop Antiq he says  A kind of pan∣cake feast preceding Lent was used in the Greek church from whence probably we have borrowed it  One of the chief diversions of the day is fighting of cocks Moresin says this was derived from the Athenians who exhibited cock fightings on one day in each year an institution of The∣mistockley and that those of the Romish church derived the custom on this day from thence The inference is ridiculous It was a general holyday and this was one of the vulgar dissipations no otherwise peculiar to the season than that the animal was in good feather at this time of the year and in condition for the greatest exertion of powers  ASH WEDNESDAY  The name only remains the peculiar customs are forgotten Penitents expressed their humiliation by sackcloth and ashes Fuller in his Church Hist p mentions a custom  Of giving ashes on Ash Wednesday to put in remembrance every christian man in the beginning of Lent and Pennance that he is but ashes and earth and thereto shall return  In the protestant church the commination or service contains a public rehearsal of those curses which we find denounced in the scriptures and which with an impious arro∣gance we interlard with an amen not with a petition for eversion assuming a right of denunciation and judgment when humiliation contrition and tears would better befit the congregation in the rehearsal of the very curses by which the most of them probably stand condemned  CARLING DAY  The second Sunday preceding Easter is called Carling Sunday The peculiar custom is the serving up parched peas to the table This seems to be derived  from the severities of the Romish church in the early ages at this period in Lent in their abstinence and mortification using such food This was called Passion Sunday and Mr Brand quotes Marshall on the Saxon Gospels vol I p where it is said Care or Carr Sunday was not unknown to the English in his time Mr Brand adds It was usual to give away beans in the dole at funerals both with the Heathen and the people of the Romish church They are used as a kind of mourning dole on this day Erasmus mentions an observation of Pliny's concerning Pythagoras's Interdiction of the use of Beans "that they contain the souls of the dead" Thence they were used in the Parentalia Plutarch held that pulse was of the highest efficacy for in∣voking the manes The adoption by Christians can only be reconciled by the preceding arguments touching Heathen rites The modern Greeks carry in funeral processions parboiled wheat  PALM SUNDAY  On this day is still retained the ancient usage of dressing windows with evergreens c in commemoration of our Saviour's entry into Jerusalem It was the custom of the ancient Christian church to represent by solemn shews even the most tremendous occurrences in the history of our Saviour a procession with palms was used In this country the buds of the saugh which is one of the earliest marks of vegetation the trees of the climate shew are gathered and adopted for branches of palm Mr Bourne says the branch of palm was used in the country near Jerusalem as an emblem of victory Our adoption of the saugh buds may arise from their being the first bloom the woods wear after winter is subdued and might be used also typically from their bearing testimony of renovation as a sacred emblem of victory over death  EASTER DAY  is attended with several singular customs The people rise before the sun in hopes to see the great luminary ascend the horizon dancing for joy This has been an innocent artifice to draw forth the vulgar to early devotion and what could be more powerfully typical and figurative to ignorant minds that conceive few images of the resurrection of our Lord than that of a glo∣rious and resplendent sun rising from a gilded horizon dispelling every gloom and shade and dispensing light beauty and joy over the face of the earth It was a season and a spectacle under the immediate impressions of which well adapted and pathetic exhortations would take a deep root The Druids and Saxons both had made it a chief object of worship and the time of sun rising the chief season for their religious rites and adorations of these strong prejudices would remain with the vulgar Bourne says the salutation of the eastern church on this day was "The Lord is risen" and the usual answer was "The Lord is risen indeed" and no doubt they were peculiar to the morning  The children have dyed and gilded eggs given them which are called  Paste Eggs  a supposed corruption of  Pasche Eggs  Eggs were held by the Egyptians as a sacred emblem of the renovation of mankind after the deluge The Jews adopted it to suit the circumstances of their history as a type of their depar∣ture from the land of Egypt and it was used in the Feast of the Passover as part of the furniture of the table with the paschal lamb The Christians have certainly used it on this day as retaining the elements of future life for an emblem of the resurrection Mr Brand has many well chosen quotations on this subject among which is a prayer extracted from the ritual of Pope Paul the Vth made for the use of England Ireland and Scotland  Bless O Lord we beseech thee this thy creature of eggs that it may become a wholesome sustenance to thy faithful servants eating it in thank∣fulness to thee  on account of the resurrection  of our Lord Jesus Christ who with thee  c c  He quotes from Dr Chandler's Travels in Asia Minor a passage in which it appears those of the Greek church on this day presented coloured eggs In Russia there is the like custom which he shews in two quotations one from the Abbè d' Auteroche in his Journey to Siberia and the other from Hakluyt's Voyage But from all the quotations no determination is drawn why the  painted Eggs  were used on this day peculiarly and especially being no part of the day's repast The field of conjecture is open and at large to every one It seems as if the Egg was thus decorated for a religious trophy after the days of mortification and abstinence were over and festivity had taken place and as an emblem of the renovation of life certified to us by the resurrection from the regions of death and the grave  Mr Brand p gives us the following note  Erasmus speaking of the proverb  Mea est Pila  that is  I have got the ball  tells us that it signifies  I have obtained the victory I am master of my wishes  The Romanists certainly erected a standard on Easter Day in token of our Lord's victory but it would perhaps be indulging fancy too far to suppose that the Bishops and Governors of churches who used to condescend to play at  hand ball  at this time did it in a mystical way and with reference to the triumphal joy of the season Cer∣tain it is however that many of their customs and superstitions are founded on still more trivial circumstances than even this imaginary analogy  It was an ancient custom for the Mayor Aldermen and Sheriff of New∣castle accompanied with great numbers of the Burgesses to go every year at the feasts of Easter and Whitsuntide to the Forth the little mall of the town with the maces sword and cap of maintenance carried before them The young people of the town still assemble there at this season particularly play at hand ball dance c but are no longer countenanced in their innocent festivity by the presence of their Governors who no doubt in ancient times  used to unbend the brow of authority and partake with their happy and con∣tented people the puerile pleasures of the festive season  It was also usual among the sports of the day to have foot courses c the prize being a  tansey cake  It has been alledged that the use of  tansey  was adopted from the Jewish mess of bitter herbs at this season A discussion of this practice of the Jews would be too tedious in this place and articles of mortification seem not to correspond with the universal festivity of the time I rather conceive that the prizes were the ancient sweet bread concerning the use of which I shall have occasion to make some remarks in the sequel and that  tansey  was used for its flavour and salubrity only  Mr Brand quotes Durand Lib c for a very singular and unreason∣able custom  That on Easter Day wives used to beat their husbands and on the day following husbands their wives" and he adds "There is a custom still retained at the city of Durham on these holydays on one day the men take off the women's shoes which are only to be redeemed by a present and on another day the women take off the men's in like manner  This custom is not a peculiarity of the city of Durham only but extends into other parts of that county as well as Northumberland As it seems to be the remains of some religious ceremony if peculiar to the cathedral it would pro∣bably travel with the See from Lindisfarn by Chester to Durham and its re∣mains would be found scattered through this passage In Lancashire the cus∣tom of the day is to lift the passenger from the ground this shews of itself of what it is emblematical But our custom leaves us wide and indeterminate conjectures In the cathedral of Durham there was a custom on Good Friday for the Monks to approach the high altar then decorated with all the solemn emblems of that tremendous day on their knees being bare footed On Easter Day they made a solemn procession when all the spectators pulled off their shoes as treading on holy ground King Canute approached the shrine of St Cuthbert from Garmondsway the distance of five miles with all his re∣tinue and attendants barefooted when he gave great territories and donations to that church Lel Col vol I p These are the most memorable circum∣stances I have been able to collect Preparatory to the passover our Saviour washed the feet of the Disciples after which he gave them this ordonance "For I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you" The Monks of Durham are said to have washed the feet of the poor within the cloister in commemoration of our Saviour's act In the ages immediately suc∣ceeding the conversion of the Britons an inveterate hatred and contempt was shewn to all Jews who by shipwreck or other casualty came among them even to a greater bitterness the aversion was carried than against the uncon∣verted Heathen The order of the passover ceremonies as set forth in the th chapter of Exodus enjoins the Jews to have their shoes upon their feet per∣haps in contradistinction or in reproach of the Jews the shoes of passengers are pulled off  SWEET BREAD  I intimated in the preceding pages an intention of remarking the  Sweet Bread  used in religious rites Small loaves of bread peculiar in their form being long and sharp at both ends are called Buns This name takes place where old religious ceremonies have been solemnized derived from the consecrated sweet bread which was offered on high festivals It is of the highest antiquity according to Mr Bryant  the offerings which people in ancient times used to present to the Gods were generally purchased at the entrance of the temple especially every species of consecrated bread which was denominated accord∣ingly One species of sacred bread which used to be offered to the Gods was of great antiquity and called  Boun  The Greeks who changed the  Nu  final into a  sigma  expressed it in the nominative  but in the accusative more truly  Boun  Hesychius speaks of the  Boun  and describes it  a kind of cake with a representation of two horns  Julius Pollux mentions it after the same manner  a sort of cake with horns  Diogenes Laertius speaking of the same offering being made by Empedocles describes the chief ingredients of which it was composed "  He offered up one of the sacred liba called a Boun which was made of fine flour and honey  It is said of Cecrops  he first offered up this sort of sweet bread  Hence we may judge of the antiquity of the custom from the times to which Cecrops is referred The prophet Jeremiah takes notice of this kind of offering when he is speaking of the Jewish women at Pathros in Egypt and of their base idolatry in all which their husbands had encouraged them the women in their expostulation upon his rebuke tell him  Did we make her cakes to worship her  c Jer xliv lb vii  Bryant's Analysis vol I p The sacred cakes which were offered at the Arkite temples were styled  Boun  and were presented upon every seventh day Bryant vol II The custom of hot  Cross Buns  in London on the morning of Good Friday seems to have relation to these ancient practices We only retain the name and form of the  Boun  the sacred uses are no more  HAGMANA  The Rev Mr Lambe Vicar of Norham Editor of the poem of Flodden Fight in his ingenious notes thereto says  We may find in the North the traces of some words left us by the Romans For example the month of of December is called  Hagmana  derived from the Greek  Hagia mene  the holy moon  ISCA  When the Shepherds call their Dogs it is usual with them to cry  Isca Isca  which is evidently an abbreviation of  Lycisca  the name of the Roman Shepherd Dog  Multum latrante Lycisca Virg Ecl  HOCKTIDE  Hockdays Þucxdaeg Dies irrisorius a time of scorning or triumphing a festival of the common people held soon after Easter The servants had liberty of divers sports and diversions and in compensation for the loss of time in their service the masters were intitled to a gratuity It was held in com∣memoration of the day on which the Danes were massacred A D and such were the licentious enormities committed therein the servants deeming themselves during this festival under no law of subordination that it was pro∣hibited by the church in the fifteenth century under pain of excommunica∣tion The remains of this festival seem to be retained in our  fools day  the st of April when all sorts of ridiculous tricks are practiced to render the person you meet with a scoff and jest it may be presumed the persons who from their connections and intercourse with the Danes lamented the horrid slaughter were thus scoffed and ridiculed and those who were ignorant of the event sent on fruitless errands to their dying friends weltering in gore Such was the savage barbarity of the times and the ferocity of our progenitors These errands are called  Sleveless Errands  which Skinner con∣strues  Lifeless Errands  MAYDAY  It still retains some of its ancient sports The young people of both sexes go out early in the morning of the st day of May to gather the flowering thorns and the dew of the grass which they bring home with music and acclamations and having dressed a poll on the towngreen with garlands dance around it The dew was considered as a grand cosmetick and pre∣served the face from wrinkles blotches and the traces of old age the hap∣piest gift Flora could bestow on her votaries It seems from these remains that this festival was introduced by the Romans who observed it in honour of Flora What particular rites originally attended it with that people we shall not enquire at present it is celebrated only with mirth innocence and love The Druids who were the priests of the God of nature and celebrated every remarkable period in the change of seasons left a memorial of their reli∣gious rites on this day very different from those instituted in honour of the notorious divinity Flora that is a Beltein rural sacrifice It is to be traced in the mountainous and uncultivated parts of Cumberland among the Cheviots and in many parts of Scotland Mr Pennant gives a particular description in his Tour in Scotland  On the first of May in the Highlands of Scotland the herdsmen of every village hold their Beltein they cut a square trench in the ground leaving the turf in the middle on that they make a fire of wood on which they dress a large caudle of eggs butter oatmeal and milk and bring besides the ingredients of the caudle plenty of beer and whisky for each of the company must contribute something The rites begin with spilling some of the caudle on the ground by way of liba∣tion  on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal upon which are raised nine square knobs each dedicated to some particular being the supposed pre∣server of their flocks and herds or to some particular animal the  al destroyer of them each person then turns his face to the fire breaks off a knob and flinging it over his shoulder says this I give to thee preserve thou my horses this to thee preserve thou my sheep and so on After that they use the same ceremony to the noxious animals this I give to thee O fox spare thou my lambs this to thee O hooded crow this to thee eagle when the ceremony is over they dine on the caudle  c  We retain something of this kind in the syllabub prepared for the May feast which is made of warm milk from the cow sweet cake and wine and a kind of divination is practised by fishing with a ladle for a wedding ring which is dropt into it for the purpose of prognosticating who shall be first married  Mr Brand in his Observations on Bourne's XXV chap makes several quo∣tations from a pamphlet intitled "The way to things by words and to words by things" He says  We gather from him that our ancestors hold an anniversary assembly on Mayday the  Column of May  whence our May Pole was the great standard of justice in the  Eycommons  or fields of May Here it was that people if they saw cause deposed or punished their Governors their Barons their Kings The garland or crown when hung on the top of the  May  or Pole was the great signal for convening the people This was one of the ancientest customs which from the remotest ages has been by repetition from year to year perpetuated  It was considered as the boundary day that divided the confines of winter and summer allusively to which there was instituted a sportful war between two parties the one in defence of the continuance of winter the other for bringing in the summer The youth were divided into troops the one in winter livery the other in the gay habit of the spring The mock battle was always fought booty the spring was sure to obtain the victory which they celebrated by carrying triumphally green branches with May flowers proclaiming and singing the song of joy of which the burthen was in these or equivalent terms  "We have brought the summer home"  PAROCHIAL PERAMBULATION  was a practice introduced by and adopted from the Romans who held an annual feast of  Terminalia  they were singularly observant of the bounds of their property and there as the most solemn mode of distinction made their places of sepulchre and erected altars In later ages the companies who went on the perambulation were attended by the parish priest and at every boun∣dary mark which was distinguished by a stone cross a prayer was put up for a fruitful season and protection against the evils of pestilence and dearth This custom and prayer have lately been disused since we grew afraid of ap∣pearing religious least we should be accused of having superstition  MIDSUMMER  The ceremonies of the eve and day of Midsummer were various and worthy attention In all these festivals it was the custom to keep the wake as it was called or watch 'till after midnight and to begin the sports and ceremonies of the day in the first hour of the morning  The summer  o  tice was the grand festival and jubilee of the Druids and all those who retained any of the Amonian rites of which we trace several in the religious ceremonies of the Saxons This day was celebrated with peculiar magnificence and solemnity when the adored luminary was at his greatest altitude It has been alledged by some that the Elusinian rites in celebrating the return of Proserpine gave part of the ceremony of this day and that the use of garlands is derived from the custom of the initiated in the Elusinian misteries being crowned with flowers  It is usual to raise fires on the tops of high hills and in the villages and sport and dance around them this is of very remote antiquity and the first cause lost in the distance of time Many reasons have been assigned in different periods Bourne quotes a passage of Durand to the following purport  In ancient times the dragons being incited to lust through the heat of the season did frequently as they flew through the air spertmatize in the wells and fountains by this means the water became infected and the air pol∣luted so that whoever drank the waters was either tormented with a grievous distemper or lost his life As soon as the physicians perceived this they ordered fires to be made every where about the wells and fountains and those things which occasioned the noisomest smell to be burnt knowing that thereby the dragons would be driven away and forasmuch as this cus∣tom was observed about the time we now celebrate St John Baptist's feast it is therefore still observed among some people  In this enigmatical and misterious account we plainly trace the fires were originally kindled for sacred rites and sacrifice in order to avert the horrors of pestilence which in early ages frequently attended the advancing heat of summer in a country covered with forests and swamps whose respiration and exhalations brought on various distempers of which Epilepsies was one of the most general to prevent which the darkness of those times had received few discoveries of medi∣cine In Scotland they used to run about the mountains and higher grounds with lighted torches like the Sicilian women of old in scarch of Proserpine The prophetesses in Mona at the approach of the Romans ran about with dishevelled hair in a frantic mode with lighted torches performing various rites to execrate the enemy It was a custom not many years ago in this county for the villagers to run with burning firebrands round their fields and then in a forcible manner taking the ashes from some neighbouring fire they used to exclaim  "We have won the flower alias flour of the wake"  Moresin conceives we trace the ancient  Cerealia  in this ceremony It is not  to be wondered that the Druid rites should in course of time be mixed with the Roman Mr Borlace speaking of this custom in Wales says  He takes it to be the remains of the Druid superstition  Moresin is of opinion the custom of leaping over the fires is a vestige of the ordeal and those perform∣ing these feats were shewing tokens of innocence and virtue by being neither burnt or sullied The act of leaping through the flames was certainly a reli∣gious one and was meant as a kind of purification and not merely a sport and display of agility Mr Pennant mentions another remarkable custom in Scotland of which he was an eye witness they take the new baptized infant and wave it three or four times gently over a flame saying thrice  "Let the fire consume thee now or never"  this seems to be the direct act of purification in passing the fire of Molock Like other heathenish customs appropriated to festivals of the christian church these are adopted on the day of St John or rather used on the same anniversary and the name of that Saint assumed to give them new sanctity Mr Brand quotes several passages from  Gebelin's Alle∣gories Orientales  Can one says he overlook here the St John fires kindled about midnight on the very moment of the solstice by the greatest part both of ancient and modern nations A religious ceremony which goes backward thus to the most remote antiquity and which was observed for the prosperity of States and to dispel every kind of evil  Divinations were also used on the vigil of this day  Men and women were accustomed to gather together in the evening by the sea side or in some certain houses and there adorn a girl who was her parent's first begotten child after the manner of a bride Then they feasted and leaped after the manner of bac∣chanals and danced and shouted as they were wont to do on their holidays after this they poured into a narrow necked vessel some of the sea water and put also into it certain things belonging to each of them then as if the devil gifted the girl with the faculty of telling future things they would enquire with a loud voice about the good or evil fortune that should attend them upon this the girl would take out of the vessel the first thing that came to hand and shew it and give it to the owner who upon receiving it was so foolish as to imagine himself wiser as to the good or evil fortune that should attend him  Bourne p  Another custom used on this day is to dress out stools with a cushion of flowers A lair of clay is placed on the stool and therein is stuck with great regularity an arrangement of all kinds of flowers so close as to form a beauti∣ful cushion these are exhibited at the doors of houses in the villages and at the ends of streets and cross lanes of larger towns where the attendants beg money from passengers to enable them to have an evening feast and dancing This custom is evidently derived from the  Ludi Compitalii  of the Romans this appellation was taken from the  Compita  or cross lanes where they were in∣stituted and celebrated by the multitude assembled before the building of Rome  Servius Tullius  revived this festival after it had been neglected for many years It was the feast of the  Lares  or houshold Gods who presided as  well over houses as streets This mode of adorning the seat or couch of the  Lares  was beautiful and the idea of reposing them on aromatic flowers and beds of roses was excellent The chief port of the ceremonies and solemnities of this feast used by the Romans as we are told by the Poets and Historians was exhibiting the houshold Gods crowning and adorning them with chaplets and garlands of flowers and offering sacrifices up and down the streets The British remains of the ceremony are more refinedthat of reposing them on those delicious beds Suetonius tells us that Augustus ordered the  Lares  to be crowned twice a year We are not told there was any custom among the Romans of strangers or passengers offering gifts Our modern usage of all these old customs terminates in seeking to gain money for a merry night  SHEEPSHEARING  The Sheepshearing festival retains nothing singular and is too well known to require any animadversions  The WAKE  The Country Wake or Feast Day called in some places the Hopping is the ancient Feast of Dedication Vide notes vol II p  MELL SUPPER  After harvest the Heathens are said to have sacrificed to the Deity Vacina or Vacuna who was supposed to preside over Rest and Ease It is now a custom on the last day of reaping to dress up an image of the corn and bear it home in triumph which is called the Kern properly Corn Baby In some places I have seen an image apparelled in great finery crowned with flowers a sheaf of corn placed under her arm and a scycle in her hand carried out of the village on the morning of the conclusive reaping day with music and much clamour of the reapers into the field where it stands fixed on a poll all day and when the reaping is done is brought home in like manner This they call the  Harvest Queen  and represents the Roman Ceres The servants having performed the most valuable part of their labour are entertained by their masters when all distinction is laid aside This feast is called the MellSupper at which there are dancing masquing and disguising and all other kinds of rural mirth The name of this supper is derived from the rites of  Ceres  when an offering of the firstfruits was made the word  Melle  being a provincial word and signifies in this country  mingled  implying that the cakes used at this festival are mingled or made of new corn and that it is the feast of the first mingling of flour of the new reaped wheat The Romans held a solemn day after harvest dedicated to Ceres and Ops the accustomed victim a boar but we cannot from any part of the above rural feast gather the least Roman remains save only the season and the image of the Goddess The re∣joicing after harvest may have an origin as high in antiquity as reaping itself The first instance we read of is in the th chapter of Genesis ver  SEMESLINS  We have a kind of cake mixed with fruit called  Semeslins  The Romans prepared sweet bread for their feasts held at seed time when they invoked the Gods for a prosperous year In Lancashire they are called  Semens  We have the old French word still in use in heraldry semèe descriptive of being sown or scattered  Many Customs are retained in Winter  ALLHALLOW MASS  The st day of November seems to retain the celebration of a festival to Pomona when it is supposed the summer stores are opened on the approach of winter Divinations and consulting of omens attended all those ceremonies in the practice of the Heathen Hence in the rural sacrifice of Nuts propitious omens are sought touching Matrimony if the Nuts lie still and burn together it prognosticates a happy marriage or a hopeful love if on the contrary they bounce and fly asunder the sign is impropitious I do not doubt but the Scotch fires kindled on this day anciently burnt for this rural sacrifice  MARTINMAS  has no peculiar celebration now remaining We are told by Moresin that the Heathen held the festival of Bacchus at this season and without remembering the jolly God the jovial service long remained in the northern counties Within half a century it was held as a season of great mirth and jollity  CHRISTMAS  has still many peculiar customs The  Saltatio Armata  the Pyrrhick or Military Dance of the Romans is still preserved men dressed out with ribbands per∣form a  Sword Dance  and gather gifts for a merry night  Others in the same kind of gay attire draw about a Plough called the Stot Plough and when they receive a gift make the exclamation  Largess  but if not requited at any house for their appearance they draw the plough through the pavement and raise the ground of the front in furrows I have seen men in the yoke of one plough  These are perfect remains of Roman customs Mr Brand quotes the follow∣ing passage  Aratrum inducere moris fuit Romanis cum urbem aliquam evertissent ut eam funditus delerent  Vocab utriusque juris a Scot J C in Verb Aratrum It may have been practised by the Romans in commemoration of the founding of Rome or some cities in Britain  "Interea Aeneas urbem designat aratro"  Virgil Aeneides lib p l  Quem Cato in originibus dicat morem fuisse condituri enim civitates taurum in dextra vaccam in sinistra jungebant et cincti ritu sabino id est togae parte capitis velati parte succincti tenebant stivam obliquam ut glebae omnes intrinsecus caderent et ita sulco ducto loca designabant murum ara∣trum suspendentes circa loca portarum Unde territorium dictum est quasi tritorium tritum bubus et aratro  The Stot Plough has been conceived by some to have no other derivation than a mere rural triumph the plough having ceased from its labour  YULE CLOG  On the eve of the Nativity the peasants place upon the fire a large piece of wood called a Yule Clog some have looked upon this as a rural sacrifice the beast being stalled there is no further use for the tether clog by which he was prevented straying in the summer from his pasture It has had a more distant implication and intended to keep up the wake and drive away malevolent spirits and spirits of darkness The Druids held a solemn festival at this time and fires were lighted to fill up the space between the last night and first morn∣ing of the year that the evil genius might not prevail The Elusinian myste∣ries were typical of the renewing year and the howlings and lamentations made in the hours of darkness for the loss of Adonis were like our solemn wake over the yule clog which was to banish the spirits of darkness whilst the sun was in his deepest recess In those rites the return of Adonis or the sun was represented by the approach of a Priest with a lighted torch thereby dispelling the horrid darkness in which the prevalency of the evil genius was described by horrid noises and all the dreadful spectacles ingenuity could de∣vise to secure the superstition of the assembly Among all nations there has appeared a prevalent superstition touching good and evil spirits one superin∣tending the hours of light the others darkness one the guides of man's recti∣tude and virtues the other his malevolence and vice  On the word Yule or Gule there have been innumerable controversies with the learned from whose arguments I am induced to believe it is a word de∣rived from the old British language and implies a Festival and thence that Yule Clog expresses the festive fuel  The Yule Baby was a sweetmeat image given to children in commemora∣tion of our Saviour's nativity  The windows are dressed with evergreens as typical of our Saviour who was called the Branch of Righteousness that liveth for ever also as memorials of his promises and our victory over death  CHRISTMAS BOX  Gifts to servants and mechanics for their good services in the labouring part of the year The paganalia of the Romans instituted by Servius Tullius were celebrated in the beginning of the year an altar was erected in each vil∣lage where all persons gave money This was a mode originally devised for gaining the number of inhabitants  The DEAD  Customs attending Death and Funerals are well known and their origin of no very distant antiquity so that I will avoid a subject so peculiarly melan∣choly and affecting save only the Arvel Dinner  On the decease of any person possessed of valuable effects the friends and neighbours of the family are invited to a dinner on the day of interment which is called an Arthel or Arvel Dinner Arthel is a British word and is frequently more correctly written Arddelw In Wales it is written Arddel and signifies according to Dr Davise's Dictionary  Asserere  to avouch This custom seems of very distant antiquity and was a solemn festival made at the time of pub∣licly exposing the corps to exculpate the heir and those intitled to the pos∣sessions of the deceased from fines and mulcts to the Lord of the Manor and from all accusation of having used violence so that the persons then convoked might avouch that the person died fairly and without suffering any personal injury The Dead were thus exhibited by ancient nations and perhaps the custom was introduced here by the Romans  FINIS
