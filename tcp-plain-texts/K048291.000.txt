 The  WOODMAN  A Comic Opera BY M  R  BATE DUDLEY  THE WOODMAN A  COMIC OPERA  IN THREE ACTS AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN WITH UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE  BY MR BATE DUDLEY  London PRINTED BY T RICKABY FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND  DEDICATION  TO BAMBER GASCOYNE ESQ  RECEIVER GENERAL OF HIS MAJESTY's CUSTOMS c  DEAR SIR  THE following OPERA is inscribed to you from two motivesGratitude and Selfinterest My best feelings are indulged by this acknowledgment of the many obligations I owe to youand my vanity I confess will derive no inconsiderable gratification from the world being informed that you have long classed me in the respectable list of your private friends  The scenes of  dramatic fiction  are not perhaps the best calculated to display the sincerity of personal regardbut my attachment is not the novelty of a day and depends not therefore on the form of a public offering  The WOODMAN indeed has on this occasion some sylvan pretensions of his own doing "Suit and Service" in that antient  HAINAULT FOREST in ESSEX  FOREST over which you exercise a joint jurisdiction he may be allowed at least a feudal claim to your protection I should pay but an ill compliment to your classical taste which I admire to suppose he will be the less welcome because he approaches you in the unaffected garb of  Pastoral Simplicity  I am Dear Sir With great Regard Very faithfully your's H B DUDLEY  BRADWELL LODGE  April    th    The following Statement proceded the Book of  SONGS  in the first Night's Representation explanatory of the Writer's Views  ADVERTISEMENT  THAT the OPERA of THE WOODMAN has been hastily put together its defects will but too plainly point out To excite the admired talents of a MUSICAL FRIEND superseded every other consideration in this undertaking In an endeavour to sketch his scenes from Nature if the Writer has failed the demerit must be entirely his own In this case he can only lament that the genius of a great LYRIC COMPOSER should have been misguided by his inabilitybut the pride of having first introduced the modest merit of Mr SHIELD to the Theatrical World he must still retain  He was advised to shelter himself under an assumed name from some friendly apprehensions on the score of party prejudice but this he thought unnecessaryThe decision of an English Audience is seldom regulated by unworthy motives and personal resentment is so invariably disclaimed by candid Criticism that to deprecate it on the present occasion would degrade even the humility of a DRAMATIC AUTHOR  To the friendly and liberal attention of  Mr HARRIS  and the zealous exertions of all the  PERFORMERS  the  AUTHOR  feels himself much indebted  From a combination of the most effective powers of the Theatre the  WOODMAN  derived that correct and animated Performance which secured to the Piece so flattering a reception  {inverted ‚ÅÇ}  The words adapted to two or three old  AIRS  unavoidably partake of a bro  irregular measure  Dramatis Personae  MEN

the day  if I can  between Sir Walter and his rantipole cousin Dinahthen to act as umpire at the archeryand at nightreceive a smile from Dolly as a recompence for all my toils  AIR I  In the World's crooked path where I've been  There to share of life's gloom my poor part  The bright sunshine that soften'd the scene  Was  a smile from the girl of my heart  Not a swain when the lark quits her nest  But to labour with glee will depart  If at eve he expects to be blest  With  a smile from the girl of his heart  Come then crosses and cares as they may  Let my mind still this maxim impart  That the comfort of man's fleeting day  Is  a smile from the girl of his heart  SIR WALTER  Calling behind  Medley why Matt Medley where are you I say  MEDLEY  Yes yes just as I thought the old Buck's noddle can't rest for dreaming of this little fawn at the Woodside  Enter  SIR WALTER  SIR WALTER  Good morrow Medleyhow are you Matt always chanting with the first cockeh you rogue  MEDLEY  I love to be

entitle me to  DOLLY  I don't know that  FAIRLOP  Welland so  EMILY  Being the constant observer of her brother's increasing worth my esteem for him insensibly grew with it till at length I listen'd too fondly to his professions of regardwhich probably I ought to have discouraged  FAIRLOP  I don't know how that should have been but that's all over child  DOLLY  Lord father does not love always beget love as I've heard my poor dear mother tell you a hundred and a hundred times to that  FAIRLOP  And so thou hast Dollybut go on my dear  EMILY  In short a mutual vow of inviolable affection was

time he has written to me in terms of unaltered affection I learnt that Wilford was on his return to EnglandTo prevent therefore the fatal effects to him of even a supposed renewal of our attachmentI
