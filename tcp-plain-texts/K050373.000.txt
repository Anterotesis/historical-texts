 THE MAGIC PICTURE A PLAY  ALTERED FROM MASSINGER  BY THE REV H BATE  Beware of JEALOUSY  It is a greeney'd Monster which doth mock  The meat it feeds on  SHAKESPEAR  LONDON Printed for T and J EGERTON Charingcross T DAVIES Russellstreet Coventgarden KEARSLEY Fleetstreet E MACKLEW Haymarket and R BALDWIN Paternosterrow PRICE ONE SHILLING AND SIXPENCE  DEDICATION TO JOHN STRUTT ESQ MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR MALDON  DEAR SIR  MY admiration of your unfeigned patriotism was not excited but confirmed by that singular and manly instance which made you revered by all who could feel for the tarnished glory of their countryTo that public virtue in the individual I esteem this Play is disinterestedly inscribed  I am Sir With great truth and regard Your sincere and Obedient servant  H BATE  BRADWELLLODGE  Nov    th    ADVERTISEMENT  TO prepare MASSINGER'S TragiComedy THE PICTURE for a modern entertainment proved a more arduous task than was at first conceived After giving a different turn to the drama by making the changes of the Picture the effects of  Eugenius  's jealousy instead of the magic art of  Baptista  and expunging the gross indelicacies which overran the play it was found that most of the characters required a little fresh modelling to complete the design of the present undertaking Hence the necessity of newwriting no inconsiderable part of the dialogue in imitation of the old Dramatist Though enamoured with the beauties of the antique structure the Alterer set about its reparation with the utmost dissidence fearing like an unskilful architect he might destroy those venerable features he could not improve What has been his success the public decision must determine  The same kind of irregular and broken measure through necessity still prevails except where the language could be reduced to the heroic verse without impairing the spirit of the dialogue  As to the  unities  being so totally disregarded by MASSINGER himself no use could possibly be made of them in the present alteration  The performance of the MAGIC PICTURE was every thing that an Author could expect or wish for The friendship and liberality of Mr HARRIS were zealously exerted on the occasion Mr SHIELD aided it with his harmonic powers and every performer by a well sustained character united in it's support but Miss YOUNGE'S SOPHIA was too striking a representation not to demand a particular acknowledgmentTo this fortunate combination of talents THE MAGIC PICTURE chiefly stands indebted for the very flattering reception with which it has been honored  London  Nov    PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr AICKIN in the Character of the Ghost of MASSINGER  WRITTEN BY W PEARCE ESQ    A Bell tolls    REGARDLESS of yon bell which strikes mine ear  I troubled shade of  Massinger  appear    Ghost rises  What frenzy cou'd impel the daring thought  To seize the PIECE my lab'ring fancy wrought  The PICTURE glowing with selected  dies    O 'tis a deed to make a  Spirit  rise  But why shou'd I meet favor from an age  That martyrs even  Shakespear  in its rage  How late had princely  Hamlet  cause to rave  Depriv'd of clowns to dig  Ophelia's  grave  Where was the  skull  whose fate remembrance wept  And where the turf on which poor  Yorick  slept  By temp'rance sooth'd each murmur here shall end  'Tis dang'rous with a  Gownsman  to contend  One charter'd over spirits giv'n to riot  Whose pow'r can lay me in the  Redsea  quiet  For now I'm quite bereft of Magic arms  And what could  Merlin  do without his charms  The Sorc'rers art is lostAnd yet this age  Exceeds the  feats  of Royal James's  Demonologia a treatise written by James the First  page  He  wrote of wizzards visiting the moon  But what are  broomsticks  to an  air balloon  Not all the scenes describ'd by  Tasso's  verse  Where Daemons met their rituals to rehearse  Could match the horrors of that crimson day  When ELLIOT'S  machinations  were at play  And the  Enchanter  CURTIS whirl'd amain  By  spells  of fire the batteries of Spain  But softThe brazen voice of War is mute  And sounds of Peace are heard in each salute  View  me  then as an herald of her way  And in this wreath the  olive  crown survey  Bend with obedience to her soft'ning strains  Nor arm against poor  Massinger's  remains  Dramatis Personae  EUGENIUS  Mr WROUGHTON  LADISLAUS  Mr WHITFIELD  EUBULUS

let the laughing sun  Imprint a burning shame upon thy forehead  HILLARIO  rises  Look if you are a man and see their tender parting  What sighs and countless kisses they've exchang'd  And full as quick as my poor heart repeats 'em  HILLARIO  You should be let blood Corisca  Love's raging fever is abroad my girl  Let's feel thy pulse one two three four  Ay galloping like mad as I suspected  Why thou hast all the symptoms of the malady  CORISCA    Placing his hand on his forehead  Count there my busy Doctor and you'll find  The pulse of folly wildly beat for shame  Thou wert not wont Hillario to be blind  I marvel would you prosper in the world  That you your betters do not imitate    Pointing behind to  EUGENIUS  and  SOPHIA  HILLARIO  Imitation 'tis but a scurvy business at the best  And in kissing it savours still more vilely  Lacking the spirit that should keep it warm  CORISCA  Peace they approach  HILLARIO  Mute as a pickled sturgeon  Enter  EUGENIUS  in a warlike habit and  SOPHIA  EUGENIUS  Since we must part my love farther to pass  Is not alone unwise but even dangerous  For on yon frontier height the Turkish camp  Extends 'twixt us and the Hungarian line  Be now discreet as ever and pr'ythee wed  Thy understanding to thy constant patience  SOPHIA  You put it to the utmost trial now    Weeping  EUGENIUS  Nay no melting  For the necessity that thus divides us  Full oft have we recounted and the cause  Wash'd with our blended tears  SOPHIA  If blest the hour that ratified our union  How can Eugenius leave me  EUGENIUS  Not as some think for mere desire of fame  Or to be cry'd up by the public voice  For a brave soldier do I appear in arms  Such airy humours strike not me Alas  Too well thou know'st with what a scanty hand  Fortune has dealt out our demeans 'tis she  Enjoins it  SOPHIA  In you alone my lord  I've all abundance  EUGENIUS  In your own language I would answer you  For thou hast been a right obedient wife  And to my power tho' short of your desert  I hope I have not fail'd in th' indulgent husband  We have long enjoy'd the sweets of love  Yet my Sophia  We must not live such dotards in our pleasures  As still to hug them to a certain loss  SOPHIA  Have you in me  Found any sign of discontent my lord  EUGENIUS  No my Sophia  Nor shalt thou e'er have reason to repent  Thy constant course in goodness if heav'n smile  Upon my honest undertakings 'Tis for thee  That I turn soldier and cheerfully embark  Upon this sea of action there to trade  For rich materials nobly to adorn  Thy lovely person and to th' admiring world  Display it in full lustre Oft I've blush'd  That other ladies inferior ev'n in beauty  And outward form but in the harmony  Of the soul's ravishing music not to be nam'd  With thee in splendour should outshine thee  While you devoid of these past unregarded  SOPHIA  If I'm so rich in your opinion why for me  Would you additions borrow  EUGENIUS  Why Should I not be justly censured  Of ignorance possessing such a jewel  Above all price if I forbore to give it  The best of ornaments Therefore Sophia  In few words know my pleasure and as briefly  As you have ever done obey me to your discretion  I leave the government of my family  And our poor fortunes to the uttermost  Of what is mine live plentifully  And ere the remnant of our store be spent  I hope with my good sword to reap for you  A harvest that shall make a merry winter  SOPHIA  Since you are not  To be by me diverted from your purpose  Go when you please my poor impatient soul  Must follow after you To tell you  What in your absence I will do would shew  But poorly my actions best will speak it  It were to doubt your love should I request  That I might hear from you but by night or day  No courier unexamin'd shall pass by  Adieu    throwing herself in his arms  If thus within your arms I dwell too long  Think of the cruel fast that must succeed  This short dear feast and you'll excuse it  Pray turn from me all that I can is spoken    Exit  SOPHIA  EUGENIUS  Follow thy mistress strait Corisca  Forbear your wishes for me Those let me find  At my return in your prompt will to serve her  HILLARIO  Fly Corisca  For my own poor part Sir I will grow lean with hard study  To make my mistress merry    Exeunt  HILLARIO  and  CORISCA  EUGENIUS  I'm strangely troubled yet why nourish thus  A fury here and with imagin'd food  Having no real grounds on which to raise  A doubt she ever was or can be false  In this I do but foolishly enquire  The knowledge of a future sorrow    Muses  Enter  BAPTISTA  BAPTISTA  Aside  Still brooding o'er imaginary ills  Which Fate herself might ne'er decreeMy scheme  May cool this selfrais'd fever in his mind  If to that credit I have gain'd in th' arts  Credulity but lend the lover's ear  Friendship at least approves of the device  EUGENIUS  I've consulted with a friend of mine  One deeply read in Nature's hidden secrets  And tho' with much reluctance him have won  To do as much as Art enables him  To resolve me of my future fate    Seeing  BAPTISTA  Here to my wish he comes  Now my Baptista  BAPTISTA  If you can  Proportion your desire to any mean  I'd pronounce you happy I have found  By certain rules of Art your matchless wife  Is to the present hour unspotted  EUGENIUS  Good  BAPTISTA  In reason therefore you should be content  And make no search of what may fall hereafter  EUGENIUS  O Baptista  'Tis not in me to master so my passions  I must know farther or you have made good  But half your promise While my Love stood by  Holding her's uprighthow thus untempted  Could she give proof of welltried constancy  But when I'm absent and my coming back  Uncertainshe without controul or curb  The absolute disposer of herselfnay more  By strong temptations press'd on ev'ry side  If then she holds out  BAPTISTA  As no doubt she will  EUGENIUS  These doubts must be made certainties  By your assurance or your boasted Art  Will lose its admiration  BAPTISTA  I cannot dive into her hidden thoughts  And learn her close intents with all my skill  But what I can I readily will do  Will it content you if while distant far  You there shall know as if you then were with her  When and how far by Love she e'er be wrought on  EUGENIUS  I ask no more  BAPTISTA  Take then this little model of Sophia  With more than human skill pourtray'd  Each line and lineament of the drawing  So punctually observ'd that had it motion  'Twould ev'n dispute originality with her    Gives him the Miniature  EUGENIUS  It is indeed an admirable piece  Whence came it  BAPTISTA  Of that no matter now  EUGENIUS  But if it have not some concealed charm  Of which I know not wherefore must I bear  Her lovely counterfeit  BAPTISTA  I'll instruct you  Carry it still about you and as oft  As you have wish to know how she's affected  With curious eye peruse it while it holds  The beauteous image that it now presents  Entire and perfect know that she remains  Not only innocent but unattempted  But if th' harmonious colouring should change  And from its softly blended white and red  Incline to jealous yellow rest assur'd  She is with ardor woo'd tho' yet unconquer'd  Should it assume a fatal sable hue  Her virtue and your honor are no more  EUGENIUS  Thanks my Baptista  So much have you engag'd me by this favor  That the service of my life will scarce repay it  Adieu  BAPTISTA  Not yet for I have more t' impart  That as we ride along for I'm not quite so old  But I may see you join th' Hungarian troops  And with the rising Sun behold the conflict  EUGENIUS  As my better angel then  You shall direct and guide meCome  Our chargers there    Exeunt  EUGENIUS  and  BAPTISTA  SCENE II  The  COURT  of  LADISLAUS  Enter  UBALDO  and  RICARDO  RICARDO  Came the courier from the camp last night  UBALDO  Yes as 'tis said with a letter  From the General Ferdinand  RICARDO  Sans question then it is of moment  UBALDO  To those who carry lives in either army  RICARDO  Was it chearfully received by the King  UBALDO  So sosoon however as assur'd  The lines approach'd within each other's view  He dispatch'd an officer to Ferdinand  With absolute authority from him  To try the fortune of the day  RICARDO  The General then no doubt will fight it bravely  Heav'n prosper him This military art  I grant to be the noblest of professions  And yet I thank my stars I never was  Inclin'd to learn it for that bubble honor  The pretty nothing for which these soldiers fight  Is in my judgment of too dear a purchase  UBALDO  Give me our court warfare eh Ricardo  The danger's not so great in the encounter  Of a mistressthe conflict there costs no limbs  Thou by thy own report Ricardo  Wast a wag when young and since that time  Hast studied every rank from the night trader  I' th' street with certain danger to thy pocket  To the gay highflier in the cabinet  RICARDO  You talk Ubaldo as though you would appear  A novice in love's mysteries or perhaps  My better genius gives you cause for envy  UBALDO  No thanks to my stars I no man envy  From my own want or his abundance  To tell thee plainly being as you see  The likelier man and of much more experience  There's no beauty  But yields ere it be summon'd and as nature  Has stamp'd me the monopolist of maidens  There's no man can buy till I have made my market  RICARDO  Ha ha ha  UBALDO  As I live I jest not Why I'd part  With half my estate nay travel o'er the globe  To find that only Phoenix in my search  That could wing out of my sure shot  RICARDO  Who will dare doubt the dexterity of him  That twangs so long a bow Pray what d'ye think  Of the Queen  UBALDO  No no Ricardo I never yet did aim  At the liproyalthat I still except  Yet were she not our Sov'reign's own soft dove  I would venture this neck to a halter  To write her in my am'rous catalogue  RICARDO  Have you but mark'd with what reserve she looks  When the King himself makes his approach to her  As she were still a virgin and his life  But one continued wooing  UBALDO  Yes and how she oft has swoon'd when she has heard  Of other women fam'd for charms or honors  RICARDO  I marvel that she does not banish hence  All other female virtue from her court  UBALDO  Well where 'twill end I know not for the King  Is so indulgent to her humours that ev'n now  When both his crown and life are at the stake  He only studies her contentand when  She's pleas'd to shew herself music and masques  Are with all care and cost provided  RICARDO  This night she promis'd to appear  UBALDO  She did and will no doubt for prithee mark  The bustle of her royal harbinger  Enter  LADISLAUS EUBULUS  and Attendants with perfumes  LADISLAUS  These rooms are not perfum'd as we directed  EUBULUS  No Sir I am sure the od'rous incense  Cost treble the price of the whole week's provision  Spent in your royal houshold  LADISLAUS  How Eubulus when my Honoria  Descends to sanctify a place and make  For me a temple say were it not profane  To deck it only with a careless hand  EUBULUS  Well since you so closely hug your fetters  In love's name wear them you are King and that  Concludes you wisefor me I do subscribe  LADISLAUS  Do and looking up behold this wonder  The Scene rising to soft music discovers  HONORIA  in State under a Canopy attended by the Court  RICARDO  Wonder it is more great Sir  UBALDO  Rapture enchantment  What think you    To Eubulus  EUBULUS  As the King thinks that is the surest guard  At least for you court butterfliesfor me  I can see a handsome woman an' she be so  Without spectacles  But yet to adoration look not on her  Heav'n how he fawns  And with what assured gravity she takes it  As if it were his duty  Oh she at last vouchafes  Her hand and as if he had suck'd nectar from it  How he's exaltedShe's about to speak  What oracles shall we hear now  HONORIA  Since you are pleas'd  With such assurances of love and favour  To grace your handmaid but in being yours Sir  A matchless Queen  I'm bound in gratitude to deserve  The grace conferr'd upon me  LADISLAUS  You transcend in all things Madam  And 'tis my glory to depose myself  From absolute commandsurrendering up  My will and faculties to your disposure  And here I vow not for a day or year  But my whole life  That whatsoever I in justice may  Exact from these my subjects you from me  May boldly challengeAnd when you require it  In sign of my subjection as your vassal  Thus will I pay my homage    Kneels to her  HONORIA  O forbear Sir  Let not my lips envy my robe on them  Print your allegiance often I desire  No other tribute  LADISLAUS  Gracious Sov'reign  Boundless in bounty  EUBULUS  Is not here fine fooling  Aside  He's questionless bewitch'd  RICARDO  There's dainty picking  For all that  Aside  EUBULUS  'Though my old life I forfeit  For it yet I must speak By your good leave Sir  I have no suit to you nor can you grant one  Having no power You are like me a subject  Her more than serene Majesty being present  And I must tell you 'tis ill manners in you  Having depos'd yourself to keep your hat on  And not stand bare as we do Gentlemen ushers  It does belong to you to see 't reform'd  He has given away his crown and cannot challenge  The privilege of his bonnet    Tauntingly  LADISLAUS  Do not tempt me  RICARDO  Aside  A devilish rough councellor this  UBALDO  The King seems all amazement  RICARDO  The Queen too has her share  Of deep imaginations Eubulus  Hath put both to't  UBALDO  Now she seems resolv'd  RICARDO  I long to know the issue  HONORIA  Give me leave  Dear Sir to reprehend you for appearing  Perplex'd with what this privileg'd old man  Hath in his taunting irony applied  You know it was your own delight  To sue to me with more humility  Than I desir'd yet 'twas my duty to obey  I do but act the part you put upon me  And though you make me personate a Queen  And you my subject when the play your pleasure  Is at an end I then am what I was  Still your humble wife and you my King  RICARDO  Admirable on my troth  HONORIA  To Eubulus  And now to your wise Lordship  Hath my King  Cause to repent th' excess of favor to me  Which you dislike speak nay boldly too  For I'm not ignorant what I can deserve  And may with justice challenge  EUBULUS  This I look'd for  After a seeming humble ebb I knew  A gushing tide would follow  Aside  HONORIA  By my birth  And liberal gifts of nature as of fortune  From you as what's beneath me I expect  What's due to Majesty in which I am  A sharer with your Sov'reign  EUBULUS  Good again  HONORIA  And as I am most eminent in place  In all my actions I would appear so  LADISLAUS  You need not fear a rival  HONORIA  I hope not  And 'till I find one I disdain to know  What envy is  LADISLAUS  You are above it Madam  HONORIA  For beauty without art discourse and free  From affectation with what graces else  Can in the wife and daughter of a King  Be wish'd I dare prefer myself  EUBULUS  Does the Court afford  No oiltongu'd parasite that you are forc'd  To be your own gross flatterer  LADISLAUS  Be dumb  Thou ceaseless spirit of contradiction  Or thy age with all its boasted bluntness  Will not another hour protect thee    A Trumpet  RICARDO  A courier my Liege  LADISLAUS  Bid him enter  EUBULUS  Here's one I fear unwelcome as myself  Enter  OFFICER  LADISLAUS  From the camp Sir  OFFICER  Ay my dread Liege this from the general    The King reads the letters  LADISLAUS  'Tis well my Queen the gallant Ferdinand  Doth here inform us that by rapid march  He hath so gain'd upon the Turkish lines  That ere the setting of the sun the fate  Of either Kingdom must be known Let's in  And there in Council wait th' approaching tidings    Exit King  c  ACT II  SCENE I  Enter  HILLARIO  and  CORISCA  HILLARIO  SO you like my speech  CORISCA  If you give it good action i' th' delivery  HILLARIO  If oh how I pity you  Why I've play'd the fool before now  CORISCA  There I do agree with you  HILLARIO  Well if I put not our mistress the Lady Sophia  Out of her dumps with laughter I look not  For preferment  CORISCA  Do and thou shalt be the best of Hillarios  For she hath drank too oft the bitter cup  A pleasant one must now restore her  But think you she'll endure a jest about his death  Since for his absence only she so grieves  HILLARIO  Um that is a question which a widow  Only can resolve and therefore worth the trying  There be who in their husband's sickness have wept  Their pottle of tears aday but being assur'd  At midnight he was dead i' th' morning  Dry'd up their handkerchiefs and thought no more on't  CORISCA  Tush she is none of that race if her sorrow  Be not true woman ne'er wept in earnest  She has made herself a prisoner to her chamber  Dark as a dungeon in which no beam  Of comfort enters  HILLARIO  And yet there may be mischief done  In a dark bedchamber nay I've heard  As much  CORISCA  Pooh she admits no visits  This hour she takes the air with fondest hope  To receive assurance from some that may pass by  Of the success and safety of her Lord  Now if your device will take  HILLARIO  Ne'er fear it  I am provided capapee having  I' th' summerhouse my properties ready  A courier's habit and his sounding horn  Found 'mongst our useless armoury  SOPHIA  speaks within    Bring my veil there  CORISCA  Be gone I hear her coming  HILLARIO  I vanish but if I don't appear  And what's more appear perfect hoot at me    Exit  HILLARIO  Enter  SOPHIA  SOPHIA  I was flatter'd once I was a star but now  Like a prodigious meteor I appear  Hung in the air between my hopes and fears  And ev'ry hour  That yields a waning light to dying comfort  I do expect my fall and certain ruin  In wretched things more wretched is delay  Dreams and fantastic visions walk their round  About my widow'd bed and ev'ry slumber's  Broke with loud alarms Can these be then  But sad presages girl  CORISCA  You make 'em so  And antedate a loss shall ne'er befal you  Such pure affection such mutual love  A house without contention in two bodies  One will and soul like to the rod of concord  Kissing each other cannot be short liv'd  SOPHIA  O Corisca  Too well I know thy reasons like thy wishes  Are built upon a weak foundation  To raise me comfort since my Eugenius  Embark'd himself upon a sea of danger  In his dear care of me I've naught but sorrow known  'Tis strange methinks no tidings yet have reach'd us  CORISCA  Ill news Madam  Is swallowwing'd while good but creeps on crutches    A horn sounds  SOPHIA  Ah what's that  CORISCA  This should be a courier from the camp  As I take it    Sounds again  SOPHIA  It maketh this way still and nearer yet  The messenger appears and in strange armour  Heav'n if it be thy will  Enter  HILLARIO  disguised  HILLARIO  'Tis no boot to strive  My horse being tir'd I'll walk me on foot  And that the castle which is very near  To give me entertainment may soon hear me  I will another lusty blast then drawing nigh  Ask for the Lady who's 'yclep'd Sophia  CORISCA  He names you Madam  HILLARIO  for to her I do convey  Thus clad in arms news of a gallant soul  By name Eugenius  SOPHIA  From my Lord 'tis I  I am that brave Eugenius's wife  So may Mars favour you in all your battles  As you with speed unload me of the burden  I labour under till I am confirm'd  Both where and how you left him  Have you no letters from him  HILLARIO  No all mere word of mouth  I' the camp we use no pens but write with swords  Know he's in health and what's more full of glory  And now I will proclaim his matchless deeds  But tremble not while I relate the wonder  Tho' I declare it in a voice of thunder  SOPHIA  This is some counterfeit braggard  CORISCA  Nay hear him Madam  HILLARIO  The rear march'd first which follow'd by the van  And winged with the swift battalia  No man durst stay to shift his shirt  Or disencumber it of its hopeful stock  Yet e'er the armies join'd that pickled elf  Thy dainty duckling bold Eugenius  Advanc'd with gallant stride like Hercules  A hundred thousand Turks it is no vaunt  Assail'd him with their bashaws of nine tails  But how did he receive e'm With his keen lance  He did so cut and carbonade 'em that  One half fledbut t' other wanting legs  And arms could neither fight nor follow  SOPHIA  This is ridiculous  HILLARIO  I must take breath  Then like a nightingale I'll sing his death  CORISCA  His death  HILLARIO  On my troth I'm out my wit forsakes me  Aside  CORISCA  Recover dunderhead  Aside  HILLARIO  How he escap'd I should have sung not died  For tho' a knight when I said so I fibb'd  Weary he was and scarce could stand an end  When looking round for some courageous knight  To rescue him as one perplex'd in woe  He call'd to mehelp help Hillario  CORISCA  He has spoil'd all  Aside  SOPHIA  Are you the man of arms Then I'll make bold  To take off your martial beaver you had fool's hair  Enough without itslave how dar'st thou make  Thy sport of what concerns me more than life  In such an antic fashion Am I grown  Contemptible to those I feedYou Corisca  Had a hand in't too as it appears  CORISCA  We did it only for your mirth Madam  HILLARIO  For myself I hope  I have spoke like a good soldier at least  SOPHIA  Hence buffoon  I never but with reverence name my Lord  And shall I hear him by thy tongue profan'd  But since you are  Transform'd and turn'd knighterrant take your course  And wander where you please for here I vow  By my Lord's life an oath I will not break  Till his return or certainty of his safety  My doors are shut against thee    Exit  SOPHIA  CORISCA  You have made  A fine piece of work on't how do you like your reward  You had a foolish itch to be an actor  And may now stroll about where you please  HILLARIO  Will you buy my share o'th' profit Corisca  CORISCA  No I fear I have already  Too much of mine own  And so dear Don Quixote taking my leave  I leave you to your new fortune    Exit  CORISCA  HILLARIO  Have I cudgell'd  My poor brain for this rare invention  To be thus rewardedI could turn  Tragedian and roar amain but that I fear  'Twould get me too large a stomach having  No meat to satisfy her cravingsAh poor me  I cannot beg in armour that would dishonour  More than myself and steal I dare not  My end must be to stand in a corn field  And fright away the crows for bread and cheese  Or find some hollow tree in the highway  And there sell switches till my Lord's return    Exit  HILLARIO  SCENE II  Enter  EUBULUS RICARDO  and  UBALDO  with wands of Office  EUBULUS  I like the issue of this stubborn battle  Are the officers gone as by the King directed  To receive the gallant General  RICARDO  Long since and ere this have greeted him  EUBULUS  You know your office Lords on his arrival  UBALDO  Who we oh fear not us my Lord I pray  We know our distance and degrees  RICARDO  The state were miserable truly if  The court had none of her own breed familiar  With all the gaits of form and punctilio  To receive its visitors  UBALDO  'Tis a great pity  That such as sit at the helm provide no better  For the training up of the gentryin my judgment  An academy erected with large pensions  To such as miraculously speak  I'th' congees cringes postures and the phrase  Proper to every nation  RICARDO  O it were  An admirable piece of work  UBALDO  And yet rich fools  Throw away their charity on hospitals  For beggars and lame soldiers and ne'er study  The due regard to compliment and court breeding  EUBULUS  Our court needs no aid this way since it is  A school of nothing else There are some of you  Whom I forbear to name whose coining heads  Are the mint of all new fashions that have done  More hurt to the kingdom by superflous foppery  Which the foolish gentry imitate than a war  Or a long famine all the treasure by  This foul excess is got into the hands of  Silkmen tailors and embroiderers  Nay the third part of the land too our nobles  Engrossing titles only  UBALDO  My Lord you are bitter  RICARDO  Sharp as a hoarfrost    A trumpet  Enter a  SERVANT  SERVANT  The general is alighted and now enter'd  RICARDO  Were he ten generals I am prepar'd  And know what I will do  UBALDO  Pr'ythee what Ricardo  RICARDO  Why I'll fight at compliments with him  UBALDO  Will you then I'll charge him too on the same gage  EUBULUS  Take care gallants you do not find this  A more desperate service than you think for    Flourish  Enter  FERDINAND EUGENIUS  and attendant Officers  FERDINAND  To an Officer  Captain command the Officers to keep  The troops still dress'd in rank and file  Till they have further orders    Exit  OFFICER  EUBULUS  Here's one speaks  In a different key this is no canting prattle  Taught in your academy of compliments    To Ric and Ubal  FERDINAND  Nay I will present you to the King myself  EUGENIUS  That is a grace will go beyond my merit  FERDINAND  You undervalue what I cannot set  Too high a price on  EUBULUS  With a friend's true heart  I congratulate your return  FERDINAND  Next to the favour  Of my Prince I'm happy in your friendship  UBALDO  By courtliness coarse enough on both sides  FERDINAND  Pray you receive  This stranger by our knowledge on my credit  At all parts he deserves it  EUBULUS  Your report  Is a strong assurance to meSir most welcome  EUGENIUS  The reverence of your age commands me  To believe it  RICARDO  This was pretty  UBALDO  But now for my attack    apart    You'll second me  RICARDO  I cannot stoop so low to do your Excellence  That due observance which your fortune claims  EUBULUS  The prig forgets his virtue and his valour  RICARDO  For being as you are the soul of soldiers  And bulwark of Bellona  UBALDO  The protection  Both of the Court and King  RICARDO  And the

Look on our court delights but first from your  Relation with delighted ears I'll hear  The music of your war which must be sweet  Ending in victory  FERDINAND  Not to trouble  Your Majesties with the description of a battle  Too full of horror for the place I'll be as brief as possible  It was well fought on both sides and almost  With equal fortune it continuing doubtful  Upon whose tents plum'd victory would take  Her glorious stand Impatient of delay  With the flower of our prime gentlemen I charg'd  Their main battalia and with their assistance  Broke in but when I was almost assur'd  They were routed by a stratagem  Of the subtle Turk  Rallying up his troops on either side  I found myself so far engag'd for I  Must not conceal my faults that I knew not  Which way with honor to retreat  EUBULUS  I like  A general that tells his faults and is not  Ambitious to engross unto himself  All honor as some have in which with justice  They could not claim a share  FERDINAND  Being thus hemm'd in  Their scymetars rag'd amongst us and my horse  Kill'd under me I every minute look'd for  An honorable end and that was all  My hope could fashion to me Circled thus  With death and horror as one sent from heav'n  This man of men with some choice horse that follow'd    To Eugenius  His brave example did pursue the track  His sword cut for them and but that I see him  Already blush to hear what

bravely came on  By him I was remounted inspir'd  With treble courage and such as fled before  Boldly made head again and to confirm 'em  It suddenly was apparent that the fortune  Of the day was ours Each soldier and commander  Perform'd his part but this was the great wheel  By which the lesser mov'd and all rewards  And signs of honor to him alone belong  LADISLAUS  And they shall  Deservedly fall on him  To the banquet nowprepare to entertain 'em    The Masques retire repeating the Chorus  HONORIA  Permit me Sir to hope  That your commanders  Especially this stranger may as I  In my discretion shall think good receive  What's due to their deserts  LADISLAUS  What you determine  Shall know no alteration  EUBULUS  The soldier  Is like to have good usage when he depends  Upon her

thousand crowns your hand dear Sir  And this shall be thy warrant    Takes off the King's Signet  Are you pleas'd Sir  With what I've done  LADISLAUS  Yes my Queen and confirm it  With this addition

can wish  EUGENIUS  If wealth were my ambition by the Queen  I am made rich already to th' amazement  Of all that see or shall hereafter read  The story of her bountyIf to spend  The remnant of my life in deeds of arms  No region is more fertile of good Knights  From whom my knowledge that way may be better'd  Than this your warlike Hungarybut alas Sir  I am not my own being by destiny  Which I

Deliver'd of you by the General  Which sinks too deeply in a woman's heart  Join'd to your presence might beget some scruple  In a meaner manbut more of this hereafter  For mine's a softer themewhen I

from whom  Such a mass of wealth was first deserv'd then gotten  Cunningly steals in upon me I have practis'd  For my certain resolution with these courtiers  Promising private conference to either  And at this hour if in the search of truth  I hear or say more than becomes my virtue  Forgive me my Eugenius  UBALDO  Now I advance    Aside  Madam as you commanded me I attend  Your pleasure  SOPHIA

seen a madam  Wear jewels of that water and dimensions  SOPHIA  What madam Sir  RICARDO  Nay nothing yet methinks  I should this ruby know yes it is the same  This chain of orient pearl and this bracelet  Have been worn before  SOPHIA  Why Sir how were they gotten say  RICARDO  Not in the field with his sword upon my life  EUBAL  hems  Plague on't how fast the minutes glide away    Aside

potent that I  Cannot resistWhy I will tell you Madam  And to how many several ladies you are  Beholden for your pretty trappingsThis was  The necklace of  Paulina  a rich Courtezan  Worn but a day when she married old  Gonzago  And left off trading  SOPHIA  Oh my heart  UBALDO  This chain  Of pearl was a great widow's that invited  Your Lord to a masque and the weather proving foul  He lodg'd in her house all nightand merry they were  But how he came by it I know not  SOPHIA  Perjur'd man  UBALDO  O there's not a single gem or jewel in the court  But may be at his command  SOPHIA  Agitated

innocence aid me for I am a creature  So forfeited to despair hope cannot fancy  A ransom to redeem me I begin to  Waver in my faith and make it doubtful  Whether the Saints so canonized for  Their holiness of life sinn'd not in secret  Since my Eugenius is fall'n from his virtue  In such an open fashion Could it be else  That such a husband so devoted to me  So vow'd to temp'rancefor unhallow'd gifts  Should thus to wantons sacrifice his fame  Was't for this he left me  Was it not enough to cloath me with the shame  But he must make me wear their am'rous spoils  Here will I tear them off and with my tears  Their poison wash awayYet hold who knows  But these are false and wanton knaves who  Traduce his honor with the basest views  His longtry'd love a different tale relates  And bids me not too rashly censure him  At least these Lords with keener eye I'll read  Ere I impute to him so foul a deed    Ex  END OF ACT THE THIRD  ACT IV  SCENE I  Enter  EUGENIUS  EUGENIUS  THIS is a desperate straight there's no avoiding  I must compliance feign to all  Her passion urges oror what only  That with my life my miseries will end  But were the pointed axe uplifted now  My neck upon the block I would not buy  An hour's reprieve by such a faithless barter  Yet after all Sophia may be false  The visit of these silken courtiers  Much alarms me for they've been early train'd  In all the soft and wanton gallantries  That shake the easy faith of yielding woman  I almost dread to ask for council here    Looks on the Picture  Ha sure I do not sleep or if I dream  This is a terrible visionI'll clear  My eyesightperhaps melancholy makes me  See that which is not  Enter  BAPTISTA  BAPTISTA  What is it there you see  EUGENIUS  Indeed Baptista 'tis but too apparent  I grieve to look upon'tbesides the yellow  That does assure she's temptedI think I see  A sable colour spread its baneful hue  O'er ev'ry line of her once lovely face  Confirming both her own and my dishonor  BAPTISTA  Aside  Well may they say that monster Jealousy  Creates the food it feeds onIndeed  I see no alteration  EUGENIUS  Fact Baptista  Make not yourself a pandar to her vices  In labouring to palliate what a mask  Of impudence can't coverDid woman e'er  In her will decline from chastity but found means  To give her passion scopemore possible  Is't with my single arm to underprop  A falling tow'ror in its violent course  To stop the forked lightning than to stay  A wanton woman  BAPTISTA  Pray you temper the violence of your passion  EUGENIUS  Oh my Baptista I am headlong thrown  Into a gulph of misery and find  Myself past hopethis figure of my idol  So late that chaste and lovely mirror  Is to a magic glass transformed and shews  Nothing but horror and deformity  BAPTISTA  I'm sure you do her wrong  EUGENIUS  Have I refus'd a Queen  Whose soft beauties had ravish'd at first sight  A hermit from his beads and chang'd his pray'rs  To am'rous sonnets to preserve my faith  Inviolate to thee with the hazard of  My death with tortures to be thus requited  Yet holdI will not curse thee Sophia  Nor for thy falshood rail against the sex  'Tis poor and common I'll only  Whisper unto myself howe'er they seem  Nor present past nor ages yet to come  Have heretofore can now or ever shall  Produce one constant woman  BAPTISTA  This is more  Than the satirists wrote against 'em  EUGENIUS  There's no language  That can express the poison of these aspics  These weeping crocodiles and all too little  That hath been said against 'embut I'll mould  My thoughts into another form and if  She can outlive the report of what I'll do  Enter  HONORIA  BAPTISTA  The Queen Sir  EUGENIUS  In sign of deep contrition for their error  My lips that shunn'd the last night profer'd bliss  Thus on your footsteps seal their willing duty  Chimerican darkness would not let me see  What now with adoration I behold  HONORIA  This is more  Than I could hope for my beauty still admits  No rival    Aside  Wait our command at distanceyou too have  Free liberty to depart    To Baptista  BAPTISTA  I am poor in manners  But thank you Madam for the favour  HONORIA  Have you taken  Good rest in your new lodgingsI now expect  Your last resolve but advise maturely  Before I hear it  Pray you rise  Your late neglect I freely pardon  EUGENIUS  My soul's on fire  HONORIA  Yet to give some allay  To this new fervor 'twere good to remember  The King whose eyes and ears are ev'ry where  And what might follow a discovery  EUGENIUS  Danger's a phantom Madam tho' the King  In our embraces stood a looker on  His torturers too with ready cruelty  To drag me from your arms it should not fright me  HONORIA  Pause yet a little  The bounties of the King and what weighs more  Your boasted constancy to your matchless wife  Should not too soon be shaken  EUGENIUS  The whole fabric  When I but look on you is in a moment  Overturn'd and as flowing rivers lose  Their names when by the ocean swallow'd  In you alone all faculties of my soul  Are wholly taken up my wife and King  Are nought but things forgotten  HONORIA  Can this be possible Fortune here I thank thee  For my purpose now is gain'd    Aside  EUGENIUS  Wherefore stay ye Madam why muse ye so  HONORIA  To think how poor an empty nothing  Is man's constancy  EUGENIUS  Your beauties make it so  In me sweet lady  HONORIA  And 'tis my glory  I could be coy now as you were but I  Am of a gentler temper However  In a just return of what I've suffer'd  In your disdain with the same measure grant me  Equal deliberation I e'er

my noble guests  Enter  HILLARIO  and  CORISCA  HILLARIO  The elder Madam  Is drinking by himself to your Ladyship's health  In muskardine and eggs and for a rasher  To 'tice his liquors down he hath got a pye  Of marrowbones potatoes and eringoes  With many such ingredients and 'tis said  He hath sent his man in post to the next town  For perfumes plunder'd from the hunted civet  CORISCA  And for the younger such a fuss he makes  To prune and dress himself as if this night  He were to play a bridegroom's part but why  I marvel much  SOPHIA  Are these same lodgings both prepar'd and deck'd  As I directed  CORISCA  To the tittle Madam  SOPHIA  Then fail not in a circumstance therein  Set down as you respect my future favor    Gives a paper Hillario and Corisca retire to read it  HILLARIO

SOPHIA  For your sake  I've put him off he only begg'd a kiss  And so we parted  RICARDO  He did not touch your lip  SOPHIA  Why sure there was no danger in the touch  RICARDO  No Quickly eat these scented lozenges  Of forty crowns an ounce or you're undone  SOPHIA  Wherefore what can be th' virtue of 'em  RICARDO  I am compell'd to use 'em in abundance  E'en when I talk with him or else be poisoned  But I'll be free with youhe was once a creature  It may be of Heaven's making but long since  He is turn'd to a druggist's shop the Spring and Fall  Hold all the year with him that he  lives  he owes  To Art not Nature she has giv'n him o'er  He moves like the fairy king on screws and wheels  Made by his doctor's recipe and yet still  They're out of joint and each day want repairing  In a frosty morning  You may thrust him in a pottle pot his bones  Rattle in his skin like beans toss'd in a bladder  If he but hear a coach fumigation cannot save him  From the chin evil In a word he is  Not one disease but all but being my friend  I would forbear his character as I would not  Wrong him in your good opinion  SOPHIA  The virtues you bestow on him to me  Are mysteries I know nothowever  Since my partiality for you in vain  I would concealthis sigh declares me your's  RICARDO  Poorblind  Ubaldo  He must take the maid  SOPHIA  Hillariobe it your immediate care  To uncloath the

RICARDO  SOPHIA  I was much to blame to credit their reports  Touching my Lord who so traduce each other  And with such virulence tho' I presume  They both are base enough and yet I hope  The means I have devis'd will shortly lead  To their recovery    Exit  SCENE III  A miserable Lodgingroom  Enter  UBALDO  in his flannel Waistcoat  UBALDO  What dost thou mean wench  Why dost thou shut the door upon me Ha  My cloaths are ta'en away too must I starve  Is this my lodging I'm sure the Lady talk'd  Of sacks and possets and a courtly chamber  But rain water pelting thro' the lattice  A torn petticoat to shroud this pallet  And an old woman's biggen for a nightcap  Are all the comforts they've doom'd me to  Slight 'tis either a pigstye or a prison  The windows are double barr'd with iron  And if I could leap down my neck were snapt  I am betray'd Rogues Villains let me out  I am a Lord by the King's courtesy  Ah that won't dothat title's now too common    Exit  SCENE IV  Another miserable Room into which there is a Casement from  UBALDO  's  RICARDO  discovered rising on his Hands and Knees  RICARDO  Zounds have you trapdoors thro' which you like  To tumble men three stories

where I cannot help myself and yet  I fain would see your visageUbaldo  Oh then thou hast chous'd thy friend and fortune's smiles  Upon thee thou'st brib'd that wanton lacquey  To throw me thus in durance vile while thou  Hath stolen into the perfum'd robes and gain'd  The costly vestments she design'd for me  UBALDO  Yes truly and in their bounty somewhat more  RICARDO  An upper blanket which thou well can'st spare  Kick'd from thy wanton chamber would befriend  Me much in this extremity  UBALDO  A what Ricardothou art mad  RICARDO  Why hast thou not  My scented night cap and my sattin vest  UBALDO  Who I Bare as a winter robinredbreast  Have they stript me Prithee throw me  Thy cloak to cover me for I m almost  Frozen to death  RICARDO  My cloak I've none left  I'm strip't as bare

RICARDO  Your'e not in earnest I presume fair dame  SOPHIA  Judge as you find and feel and now attend  To what I do irrevocably purpose  Forgetful of all hospitable duties  You with the defamation of my Lord  Would fain have wrought upon my woman's weakness  To yield my honour to your lawless sports  HILLARIO  Mark that I pray my wanton masters  SOPHIA  In doing this I blush while I relate it  You have transgress'd against the dignity  Of man who's bound by virtue to defend  And not to violate fair female chastity  But in the toils ye set you're caught yourselves  And therefore do not hope to find from me  The common sentence for offending man  Such usage you have forfeited therefore  Like the most slavish of your sex shall you be treated  UBALDO  How do you mean to use us  SOPHIA  Ease and excess of feeding made you wanton  A pleurisy of ill blood you must let out  By labour and spare diet refill your veins  Or perish with hunger Bring here a distaff  Tho' no Omphale or I do mistake it  Nor you a second Hercules fetch it    Exit Servant  As you spin well at my command and please me  Your wages in the coarsest bread and water  Shall be proportionably encreased  UBALDO  I'll starve first  SOPHIA  That's as your Lordship pleases  RICARDO  I marvel  What will be the destiny of poor Ricardo  SOPHIA  You shall have gentler work I've oft observ'd  You proud to shew the fineness of your hand  And softness of your fingers you shall reel  What he doth spin deliver their materials  Now that you know your penance fall to work  Hunger will teach you to subdue your passions    Exit  SOPHIA  and Servants  UBALDO  I shall spin a fine thread here  I cannot look  Upon such devices but they'll put me in mind  Of ropemakers  HILLLARIO  A good conceit truly  For if you are industrious enough  You'll just spin rope enough to hang you both  Against my master does return from camp  To pass this honorable sentence on you  RICARDO  Let me have my cloaths again I pr'ythee  I was bountiful unto thee  HILLARIO  Oh fie  Forget such vanities my livery there  Will serve you well enough to work in  Besides they're past the wearing of a Lord  Nay mine by promise you yourself do know  You have no holidays coming nor will I work  While these and this  purse  lasts and so if you please  Shut up your shop and take yourselves to rest    Scene closes on  UBALDO  and  RICARDO    Exit

dark  She's bound to it by her canons  LADISLAUS  Still tormented  With thy impertinence  HONORIA  By yourself dear Sir  I was ambitious only to overthrow  His boasted constancy in his consent  But for fact I contemn him I was never  Unchaste in thought I labour'd to give proof  What pow'r dwells in this beauty you admire so  And when you see how soon it hath transform'd him  As strait you shall  And with what superstition he adores it  Determine as you please    Exit  LADISLAUS  Well I'll observe the issue  EUBULUS  How had  you  took this General in  your  wife  FERDINAND  As a strange curiosity but Queens  Are privileg'd 'bove subjects and 'tis fit    Exeunt  SCENE V  Enter  EUGENIUS  and  BAPTISTA  BAPTISTA  I'm glad you're so convinc'd for she is true  Or art and Nature both are leagued against us  EUGENIUS  Fool that I was to doubtI know she's constant  And in my loving ne'er look'd so fair    Looks at the picture  In short Baptista I've a vision seen  This morning makes it

 Enter'd the lists  EUGENIUS  And I prepar'd to meet her  BAPTISTA  I know my duty    Going  HONORIA  Not so you may stay now  As a witness of our contract  BAPTISTA  I obey  In all things Madam  HONORIA  Where's that reverence  Or rather superstitious adoration  Which captivelike to my triumphant beauty  You paid last night No humble knee nor sign  Of vassal duty then you freely swore  Your certain loss of life in the King's anger  Was far too mean a price to buy my favor  And that false glowworm fire of constancy  To your wife extinguish'd by a brighter light  Shot from our eyes  EUGENIUS  I do remember  I once saw such a woman  HONORIA  Ha  EUGENIUS  And then  She did appear a most magnificent Queen  And what's more virtuous tho' somewhat shaded  With pride and self opinion  EUBULUS  Call you this courtship  EUGENIUS  And she was happy in a royal husband  Whom envy could not tax unless it were  For his too much indulgence to her humour  EUBULUS  Pray Sir observe that touch 'tis to the purpose  EUGENIUS  You yet retain  Some part of her angelic form but when  Envy to the beauty of another woman  One she had never seen but in this picture  Had spread infection thro' her veins  HONORIA  I like not this    Aside  EUGENIUS  Desire in all th' enticements it could steal  From majesty however disguis'd had took  Sure footing in the kingdom of her heart  Once the throne of chastityhow in a moment  All that was gracious great and glorious  Like seeming shadows wanting real substance  Vanish'd  HONORIA  How his reasoning works upon me  EUGENIUS  Retire into yourself fair Queen  There your own breast is strongly nerv'd by virtue  Be but as you  were  and there is no office  So low to which a man may stoop  But I will gladly bow to  But as you play and juggle with a stranger  Varying your shapes like  Thetis  tho' beauties  Such as are by poet's raptures painted  Were all in you united you would pass  Pity'd perhaps but not by one regarded  HONORIA  I'm disenchanted  And ever from this moment shall despise  The flatterers who've deceiv'd me  LADISLAUS  I'm charm'd  With what I've seen and heard    They come forward  HONORIA  How have I wander'd  Out of the track of honour and mislead  By the o'erweening pride and flattery  Of fawning sycophants  Could never meet till now a passenger  That in his charity would  Stay me in my precipice to ruin  How ill when you know all  Have I return'd your goodness to me  The horror in my thoughts oft turns me marble  What can I do to shew my deep contrition    Kneels to the King  LADISLAUS  Pray you rise  HONORIA  Never till you have forgiv'n and receiv'd  Unto your love and favour a chang'd woman  My state and pride turn'd to humility  Henceforth shall wait on your commands  LADISLAUS  All is forgot and this fair change shall prove  A second and a happier union to us  HONORIA  Why did you make me rise my loving Lord  Till with a free confession of a crime  Unknown as yet to you I ask'd a suit  LADISLAUS  Whate'er it be my lips do thus confirm it    Kisses her hand  HONORIA  Know then in envy of this good man's wife  I did suborn those ready courtly slaves  Ubaldo and Ricardo to corrupt her  EUBULUS  I marvell'd if the mischief were all out  HONORIA  How far I have prevail'd I'm ignorant  But my request good Sir in fine is this  That you for th' honour of this gallant knight  Would let us travel thither the journey  Being but short to call them home  LADISLAUS  This hour  We will put on  BAPTISTA  I if you please your royal harbinger    Exit  EUGENIUS  And I your faithful follower  LADISLAUS  I thank you  Let me infold you in my arms your service  'Gainst the Turk compar'd with this weighs nothing  EUGENIUS  I am still your humble soldier  LADISLAUS  My true friend  FERDINAND  And so you're bound to hold him  EUBULUS  Such a plant  Imported to your kingdom and here grafted  Wou'd yield more fruit than all the idle weeds  That suck up your reign of favour  LADISLAUS  In my will  I'll not be wantingprepare for our journey  Hence to the winds all doubts and jealous fears  For now  Honoria  like herself appears    Exeunt  ACT V  SCENE I  EUGENIUS  's Castle  Enter  SOPHIA

HILLARIO  I do remember that they stopp'd their noses  At the fight of beef and mutton as coarse feeding  For their fine palates but now their work being ended  They leap at a barley crust and hold cheeseparings  With a spoonful of pall'd wine pour'd in their water  For festival dainties  CORISCA  When I examine  My spinster's work he trembles like a 'prentice  And takes a box on the ear when I spy faults  And botches in his labour as a favour  From an angry mistress  HILLARIO  The other too reels well  For his time and if your Ladyship would please  To see 'em they'd much delight you  With their hungry dialogues  SOPHIA  But should they grow rebellious in their prison  When we enter  HILLARIO  Ne'er fear't I'll undertake  To lead them out by th' nose with a coarse thread  Of the one's spinning and make the other  Reel after without grumbling  CORISCA  Dear Madam  'Twill help to drive away your melancholy  SOPHIA  And so they've voluntarily confess'd  That by the Queen they're sent

kissingI have lips too  However cold ones Madam  SOPHIA  I will warm 'em  With the fire of mine  EUBULUS  And so she hasI thank you  I shall sleep the better all night for't  EUGENIUS  You express  The boldness of a wanton courtezan  And not a matron's modesty take up  Or you're undone for ever  SOPHIA  How Is that  The Queen so careful of me in your absence  She knew how tedious 'twas for a young wife  To pass away her melancholy hours  Without good company so cull'd me out  Two sprightly Lords from her own courtly store  To do me all good offices as such  Employ'd by her I hope I have receiv'd  And entertain'd them nor will they depart  Without th' effect arising from the cause  That brought 'em hither  EUGENIUS  Monstrous impudence  SOPHIA  I beg your Royal pardon  While I go out and bring those to your presence  Who shall attest what I have said    Exit  SOPHIA  and Attendants  LADISLAUS  How now turn'd statue Sir  EUGENIUS  Fly quickly fly  From this curst habitation or yon gorgon  Will make you all as I am on her tongue  Millions of adders hiss and every hair  Upon her wicked head's a snake more dreadful  EUBULUS  These are the fruits  Of marriage an old Bachelor as I am  And will continue so is not troubled  With these vagaries  LADISLAUS  It suits not with your fortitude  To let your passion thus transport you    To  EUG  HONORIA  Reflect that you were once deceiv'd in me  EUGENIUS  Hath she not all confess'd and vilely fled  To fetch her pamper'd paramours  Deck'd out in triumph o'er my soul disgrace  See where they come but this shall  EUGENIUS  draws his sword but starts back on the nearer approach of  SOPHIA  who leads down  UBALDO  and  RICARDO  attended by  HILLARIO  and  CORISCA  How's this more mysteries in store  EUBULUS  What have we here  SOPHIA  You must come on and shew yourselves  UBALDO  The King  RICARDO  And Queen too  LADISLAUS  I remember  This face when it was in a better plight  Are not you Ricardo  RICARDO  I was once so please  Your Grace  HONORIA  And this thing I take it  Was once Ubaldo  UBALDO  I am now I know not what  RICARDO  We thank your Majesty for employing us  To this subtle Circe  SOPHIA  You see Madam  How I have cur'd your servants and what favors  They with their gallantry have won from me  You may as they are physic'd I presume  Now safely trust them they have learnt besides  Their several trades to live by and paid nothing  But cold and hunger for them and may now  Set up for themselves for here I give them over  UBALDO  Then hang all trades  I'll find a new one that is to live honest    Exeunt Ubaldo and Ricardo  HILLARIO  I am sorry for this general gaol delivery  These are my fees however so I'm content    Exit strutting in his fine cloaths  SOPHIA  As for you Sir    To Eugenius  EUGENIUS  Which way shall I intreat you  I am not worthy of it my Sophia  My best Sophia here before the King  The Queen these Lords and all surrounding us  I do renounce my error and embrace you  As the great example to all after times  With reverence to imitate  SOPHIA  Not so Sir  I still hold off although I here have clear'd  My doubtful innocence  When you went to the wars  I set no spy upon you to observe  Which way you wander'd though our sex by nature  Is subject to suspicions for I fix'd  My confidence on your try'd loyalty  But to deal as you did 'gainst your reason  With magic nonsense to survey my actions  Was more than woman's weakness therefore know  And 'tis my boon unto the King I do  Desire a separation from your bed  For I will spend the remnant of my life  In pray'r and meditation  EUGENIUS  O take pity  Upon my weak condition or I am  More wretched in your innocence than if  I had found you guilty Have you shewn a jewel  Out of the cabinet of your rich mind  To lock it up againShe turns away  Will none speak for me Shame hath robb'd me  Of the use of utterance  LADISLAUS  Since you have conquer'd Madam  You wrong the glory of your victory  If you use it not with mercy  EUBULUS  Have I liv'd to see  But one good woman and shall we for a trifle  Have  her  turn nun I'll first pull down the cloysters  'Tis not enough sweet Dame that you are good  We must have some o' th' breed  Shew me but two such more  I'll love myself and may bemarry  HONORIA  She that yet  Ne'er knew what 'twas to bend but to the King  Thus begs remission for him  SOPHIA  O dear Madam  Wrong not your greatness so  ALL  We are all suitors  SOPHIA  I perceive  There's no resisting your entreatiessince  My own fond heart demands his restoration  But should I pardon what's already past  Who can secure me that he will be free  From hideous Jealousy hereafter  EUGENIUS  I  Will be mine own securityGo ride  Feastrevelbanquetand with whom you please  I'll set no watch upon you and from hence  Blushing to think how passion has misled me  This cheating semblance of thy beauteous self  I throw away  And only bow to nature and to thee    He tears the Picture from his n  k and kneels to  SOPHIA  BAPTISTA  If from her sov'reignty you ne'er had swerv'd  No stratagem of mine had been devis'd  To practice aught on your credulity  EUGENIUS  Blind as I was  BAPTISTA  But since it lur'd you from that fatal gulph  To which suspicion blindly leads her train  I do applaud me for the deed  SOPHIA  And I  My plaudits join for now my mind's at ease  And every soft idea bids him welcome  Within great Prince our humble board is spread  And waits the honor'd sanction of your presence  LADISLAUS  We will attend youYour hand fair hostess  Unless it feed the good man's
