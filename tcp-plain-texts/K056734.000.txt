cap  II  Last night a little bowzy  With whiskey ale and cyder  I ask'd young Betty Blowsey  To let me sit beside her  Her anger rose  And sour as sloes  The little gypsy cock'd her nose  Yet here

tall so he's over five feet  Not dull nor too witty  His eyes I'll think pretty  If sparkling with pleasure wherever we meet  II  Tho' gentle he be  His man he shall see  Yet never be conquer'd by any but me  In a song bear a bob  In a glass a hob nob  Yet drink of his reason his noddle ne'er rob  This is my fancy  If such a man can see  I'm his if he's mine until then I am free  Dar  Have I not

my boon  Arise to partake of the chase  And Sol lends a ray to chaste Dian's fair moon  And a smile to the smiles of her face  For the sport I delight in the bright queen of love  With myrtles my brows shall adorn  While Pan breaks his chaunter and skulks in the grove  Excell'd by the sound of the horn  The dogs are uncoupled and sweet is their cry  Yet sweeter the notes of sweet echo's reply  Hark forward my honies the game is in view  But love is the game that I wish to pursue  II  The stag from his chamber of woodbine peeps out  His sentence he hears in the gale  Yet flies till entangled in fears and in doubt  His courage and constancy fail  Surrounded by foes he prepares for the fray  Despair taking place of his fear  With antlers erected a while stands at bay  Then surrenders his life with a tear  The dogs are uncoupled c  Enter  NORAH  AIR VI  The meadows look chearful the birds sweetly sing  So gaily they carol the praises of spring  Tho' nature rejoices poor Norah shall

bliss in possessing  How blest when 'tis love that insures us a blessing  Caress'd ah what rapture in mutual caressing  What joy can I wish for was Norah but mine  II  The feasts of gay fashion with splendor invite us  Where luxury pride and her follies attend  The banquet of reason alone should delight us  How sweet the enjoyment when shar'd with a friend  Be thou that dear friend then my comfort my pleasure  A look is my sunshine a smile is my treasure  Thy lips if consenting give joy beyond measure  A rapture so perfect what joy can transcend  Norah  Pray Sir permit me to withdraw as
