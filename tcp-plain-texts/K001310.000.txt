 Daniel Defoe  ADVICE TO ALL PARTIES  By the Author of  The Trueborn Englishman  LONDON  Printed And are to be Sold by  Benj Bragg  at the  BlueBall  in  AveMaryLane  MDCCV  THE PREFACE  THese Sheets having with their unhappy Author fall'n into the Barbarous and Unjust Hands of the late Ministry had never seen the Light had not Providence seem'd to reserve them for two Ends  As a standing Monument of the dext'rous Management of a certain most Exquisite Statesman whose strictest Scrutiny all these Papers past and yet came home as Things relating to the Author's private Concerns and with them several other Manuscripts which no body but such an overvigilant Minister would ha' parted with  As a Subject for which there was yet a more proper Juncture coming when it would be more than ordinary useful  bition of all his Actions  He is sure it cannot be  rinciple is the Good of  Country they that want Advice it may do good to they that want it not  can do no harm to  The Tendency of this as of all he writes is the general Peace of Parties a Subject never to be sufficiently pursued and embrac'd by all honest Men in this Nation as that without which we are undone at Home ruin'd Abroad and must at last fall a Prey to the Invading Power of Popery and Foreigners  Advice to all Parties  HE that gives his Advice before it is ask'd expects no Fee for his Counsel and so the Author of these Sheets stands clear from the Scandal of Bribery  If the Gifts of the Spirit qualify a Man for Teaching his Neighbours by the same Rule if any Man knows more than another he may tell him his Mind and then every one is free to do what he pleases  The Author tho' he is no profess'd Statesman may pass for a gifted Brother that way If he says nothing to the purpose yet hear him and if he says any thing that is to the purpose hear him and no more  Whatever the World may say of him they cannot imagine him to be such a Fool as to think he shall please every Body What suits the Wise Man won't please the Fool If the Honestman is contented the Knaves will murmur Peace won't please the Soldier nor Plenty the Farmer Truth will please the Wiseman and he that cannot discern it is a Fool worth no Body's Notice  The World is made up of a Conjunction of Contraries and the Harmony is the more Admirable So the Times dilcover a Conjunction of opposite Parties which if they can be brought to keep the Peace the Union wou'd be something wonderful  Before we come to talk with the Gentlemen concern'd 'will be needful to separate the Parties Sheep and Goats Birds of a Feather set every Sort by themselves with their Characters and Descriptions that all People may look out and know them and look in and know which sort they belong to  We are at present the most divided Nation in  Europe  the Jest of all the World The  Polanders  are Fools to us We have among us as some have observ'd three or four and thirty sorts of Religions and twelve or thirteen Severals in Politicks In Religion here are  Christians  and  Jews    Papists  and  Protestants    Heathens    Pagans    Idolaters  and  Atheists  worse than any of them  Deists    AntiDeists    Socinians    Arminians    Pelagians    Gnosticks    Donatists    Adamites    Sweetsingers    Enthusiasts    Families of Love    Arians    Antinomians    Freewillers    Seventhday Men    Universal Redemptioners    Asgelites    Quietists    Lutherans    Calvinists    Hugonots    Church of  England  Men  of several Sorts  Puritans    Presbyterians    Independants    Anabaptists    Quakers    FifthMonarchyMen  and the D  and all  If but one Sort of these are in the right God knows which Sort that is and the Lord have Mercy on all the rest If all Sorts may be in the right than  'tis no Matter what Sort a Man's of and there's no need of any Strife about the Matter  In Matters of Politicks the numerous Kinds have obtain'd the Sirnames of  Courtparty  and  Countryparty    Tories    Whigs    Trimmers    Loyalist    Royalist    Commonwealthsmen    Williamites    Jacobites    High Church    Low Church  and  No Church    NonJurants  or  ChurchDissenters    Church Whigs  and abundance of other Sorts which the Custom of the Times have been pleas'd to give Titles to  But when all these Names are made use of with many more by way of Contempt upon one another to shew our Want of Goodnature as well as Want of Manners the real unhappy Differences of this Nation seem to lie among the Parties at Court that lately had the Ministry and those that have it now between the Furioso's in the Church who are for carrying all before them and the Moderate Men in the Church who are for Peace joyn'd with the Dissenters who are for the Liberty they enjoy being preserved  To these Gentlemen the following Advice is directed If they think 'tis good they'll accept the Hint or come under the Class of  Solomon  's Fools that hate Instruction If they contemn it they ought to shew a Reason for it or else they are in  Solomon  's Reach again  He that judges of a Matter before he hears it 'tis Folly and Shame unto him  Temerity in Politicks is certainly the most impolitick thing in the World Too much Haste may do Harm but seldom does Good and and one would think the late Reign of King  James  might be a  Memento mori  to all the Sons of  Jehu  either in Church or State  He is certainly the Friend of such men who advises them to check their Career before they go too far because such Tempers always run on to their own Confusion as well as other People's  But to tell who I mean without going far about There's a sort of People among us who after their  Tears of Joy  for the Death of King  William  were dry'd up began to be comforted very early with the Halcyon Days of Queen  Ann  and as if they had made their Conditions with her before Hand they gave a Loose to their Passions and discover their Satisfaction in the Country CoffeeHouses in Terms like these  Well Boys  Now  we shall have brave Times again  Brave Times says his honest Neighbour who was melancholly still for the Nation's Lois  Why what's the Matter  Matter why  we have got a Church of  England  Queen and all these damn'd Phanaticks will go down again  We'll have them all  turn'd out now  We'll have  no more Canting within the Noise of our Church Bells  no  TubPreaching  no  Barnmeeting  no  Whiggish Justices now that a poor Man can't get a Cup of Beer in his Crown of a Sunday after Sermon but his Neighbour shall be plaguing him with the Stocks And if he happen to swear an Oath or so to be teaz'd with Informers that a Man can't take a Glass of Wine after Sermon but he shall be Fin'd and Expos'd for it here has been such  a  plutter with your  Reformation of Manners  and your  Dutch  Government We have an  English  Queen and a true Church of  England  Queen and down you go We'll have your MeetingHouses about your Ears quickly  That this is Matter of Fact that this was the Discourse not in the Mouths of here and there a Fool but of a whole Party I'll at any time set my Name to the Charge And I suppose no Body need put me upon the Proof  Nor was Her Majesty's Declaration to her Council or Speeches to the Parliament or Her Answers to the Dissenters Addresses of any Weight with these sort of People tho' Her Majesty took exceeding Care on all Occasions to make all Her Subjects easy by giving them Assurances First That She would be a Religious Observer of Her Royal Word And then giving Her Royal Word that She would Maintain the Toleration and give Her Protection to the Dissenters  Let me tell those Gentlemen that they are guilty of two Crimes First great Indiscretion in shewing their Teeth before the Muzzle which the Laws have put upon them is taken off and that they have no Power to bite Secondly So much want of Manners and Respect that shou'd the Author write half so much Satyr upon the Queen in this Book 'tis to be thought he wou'd write himself into  Newgate  and very well he wou'd deserve it  What can the English of such Language be other than this That the Queen made such Promises of Protection to the Dissenters and continuing the Toleration only to quiet their Minds at Her first Accession and 'till She is Settled in the Throne or perhaps 'till the War abroad is over but She does not design to keep her Promise with th  m but they shall all be suppress'd as soon as Opportunity offers And  truly Gentlemen Her Majesty is very much beholden to you  The short Advice the Author thinks fit to give such People is to hold their Tongues and have more Manners than affront the Queen at so Impudent a Rate and since they have shown their good Will let them be quiet till their  comes  Her Majesty being inform'd of their rudeness shou'd think fit to give the Nation a further Assurance of Her Justness to Her Promises by punishing them for their raising a Scandal upon her Veracity  A second sort of People which the Author pretends to give Advice to are such as upon the Queen's Dissolving Her first Parliament and Calling a New one pretended to tell us what brave things that approaching Parliament would do for them  We have now gotten a ChurchParliament a Loyal Churchof  England  Parliament say they and now we will do your Business and this Parliament shall  us all to Rights again Now we'll dismount the Two  Bulwarks of Whiggish Hopes for this Parliament shall repeal the  of Toleration and the Settlement of the Crown They shall leave the  English  Throne to be as it always was Hereditary and let Right Line and Descent take place that  English  Loyalty may flourish and the Prerogatives of Princes be no more invaded nor the Nation be govern'd by  Dutch  Men and Foreigners  I believe no Body will dispute with me the Truth of Fact that this was the Talk not of a Single Person or of a few but of a Party their Common their Table their CoffeeHouse Discourse  How to comment upon such Insolence I hardly know This  is an Iniquity to be punished by the Judge  And if the House of Commons did not take Cognisance of such People it was because they restrained their Resentment of such Affronts more than any House of Commons ever did before them  As to the last Parliament the Author has no Business to say any thing of their Religion But I think all our Parliaments have been ChurchParliaments nor is there any Doubt but they always will be so But what sort of Doings is this with Parliaments if they are to be anticipated led by a Party and told beforehand what they shall do  If this sort of People conferr'd with the Members and concerted with them beforehand what should or should not be done if so we had then such a Parliament as never was before  But if these Gentlemen did this only to inflame Parties only to let us see what they would have done what Design they were driving at 'tis time for the Nation to open their Eyes and Examine who they are  The Act of Settlement is the Foundation on which the Nation stands 'Tis the Sacred Pillar of the present Goverment and on it may be very well plac'd the  Scotch  Motto  Nemo me Impune Lacessit  'Tis the  Sanctum Sanctorum  near which no Man may approach without a Blast from the Breath of the whole Community This is the  Ark of our Israel  before which the  Dagon of the  Jure Divino  Men  is fallen with his Head and his Hands knock'd off 'Tis the Pedestal of the  English  Throne which if it be remov'd the whole Column of the Government sinks and the Capital which is the present Queen must fall with it Her present Majesty can have no Right to the Crown if King  James  left a Son  but by the Act of Settlement  Now 'tis worthy of Remark that the Gentlemen who talk of repealing the Act of Settlement don't do it barely because the Crown is not thereby limited to their liking But they are for repealing it as a thing not legal in its own Nature they would have the Parliament disown the Right of Limiting the Crown and acknowledge a Right of Succession  Jure Divino  That Kings of all Religions or Principles must be submitted to if they come of the Race That the Right Line must succeed and 'tis not in the Power of the People of  England  either Collectively or Representatively  to question their Princes or to oppose their Oppressive unjust ProceedingsThe latent Consequences of this will come in at the last  viz  That the late Revolution was an Act of Rebellion against God and the King That it was a Violence offered to God's Vicegerent against Justice and Allegiance That King  William  was an Invader of another Man's Right an Usurper and a Tyrant and so we are all acomming Gentlemen to the old Point against  Passive Obedience    NonResistance    Dispensing Power  and all the Absurdities and ridiculous Contradictions of the late Reigns come into Play again and we have spent thirteen Years War a Mass of  English  Money and a Sea of  English  Blood to a fine purpose  This is one Design in striking at the Act of Settlement another is to supplant the House of  Hanover  because forsooth they don't like them They are ashamed to own what they would have but the Case is so plain that it needs no Comment A late Author has published the Life of King  James  and taking no Notice of this Act says "King  James  died and left one Son and two Daughters Now what is the Language of this Party  If we must submit to the Queen's reigning before her Brother because she is Crown'd and has Possession we can't help it but we are  next Oars  and there is no reason to expell the rest of his Family Here is  a Son  and a  Daughter  we may have them home make Protestants of them and never run up into  Germany  for an old Woman and her  Dutch  Progeny to Reign over us  Here is the plain  English  of the Design a Design which aims at the Root and Fundamental Part of our Constitution And tho' there is no great Danger of the thing yet 'tis plain they push at it with all their Might  As to this Act of Settlement First The Queen who Reigns by Virtue of such a Settlement has not once but several times given Her Royal Promise to maintain it So that if ever such an unhappy Time shou'd come that a Parliament shou'd offer to disannul it we have Her Majesties Honour which we trust will never forsake her to have recourse to as a Check to the fatal Mischief And if both Queen and Parliament shou'd be so mistaken and so much Blindness from above shou'd in Judgment to them be their Portion the Native Original Right of the People of  England  as the Fountain of Power and Government will come up and give a Negative to the Execution What will any new Settlements of the Crown that may be made amount to if the People of  England  who have an undoubted Right to the Government themselves shou'd contradict them at the Time they wou'd Enter upon the Possession with this general Negative  We will not have this Man to Reign over us  The Safety of the  English  Nation rests in and depends upon themselves  The People of England  are a Security to  the People of England  for a Preservation of all their own Essential Right and among the rest this is the chief to be govern'd by  Princes of their own Nomination  and Laws of  their own making  No Prince can Reign here but by the Consent of the People and by  no Laws  but such as become Laws by the Consent of the People It has been in vain attempted to bugbare the Nation into Villenage and Vassalage but the Liberties of  England  has always been like the Stone in the Gospel whosoever has fallen against them has been broken to pieces and on whomsoever they have fallen has been groun'd to Powder  The  English  Nation has not many more Liberties than they had before but they know them better than they did  We know now that  our Princes are circumscrib'd  by the Laws and Constitutions of the Nation are oblig'd to Govern justly and perform the Stipulation of Government declar'd in two Acts of Parliament We know that if they Issue out illegal Commands 'tis no Treason to disobey If a Prince should Levy Money by Arbitrary Authority any Freeholder may refuse to Pay it and be guilty of no Crime If 'tis Levied by Force he may oppose it with Force and yet be no Rebel  We know the very Parliament themselves can't dispence with the Law but in a Parliamentary Way No Law can cease to be a Law till repealed by the same Power that made it and nothing can have the Force of a Law in  England  but what has the People's Consent in Parliament  The Power of Parliament and how far the Members are accountable to their Principals is not for me to determine but this I venture to say that without Doubt a Member of Parliament is to have some Regard in Honour to the Inclination of the People he serves at least not to act what he knows is contrary to their Desire  'Tis plain that the Act of Settlement is the most Valuable thing in the Government as the Security we have against future Slavery  'Tis the Account we are to give to our Children of our Care for their Safety  'Tis the Bulwark of the Nation against Popery and Tyrany and none but the Enemies of our Liberties can wish to see it Repeal'd 'Tis our double Security  First  as it is an Acknowledgment of the People's Power to limit the Crown and  Secondly  as it has effectually declared the Right of the Subject their Liberties and just Priviledes under such as shall Reign hereafter  Some have thought that the Party in a certain House who made it their business to limit thwart and affront the late King  William  particularly as to the Matter of the Army and afterwards the Grants of Lands in  Ireland  while they carried on their private Pique at the King involuntarily and unwarily set their Hands to the Peoples Liberties and made such Declarations of the Rights of the Subject as they wou'd be glad to have now undone if they could if they were led into this by another Party they were trick'd with a Vengeance But a Learned Gentleman who was formerly a great  Jure Divino Man  was pleas'd to say of it with an Oath  We are going to make our selves all Kings only to cross one King  But let the Design ha' been what it will the People's Liberties were Recognized by some Gentlemen who if it should ha' been told them formerly  that they should ha' done so and so  wou'd ha' answer'd with the  Assyrian  Captain  Is thy Servant a Dog  that he should do these things  To these and all the Gentlemen of that Party who aim at altering the Act of Settlement our Advice is short  Have a Care Gentlemen what you do  Methinks you should not have the Face to expect or the Impudence to desire the Queen to break her Word the ParliamentMen to Act contrary to the Interest and Inclination of the People that chose them a Papist set upon the Throne a rupudiated Impostor Acknowledged an Abjur'd Race receiv'd 'Tis true all Acts of Parliament may as Acts be repeal'd by Parliament but some things are in their own Nature to be continued this can't be repeal'd if the Queen shou'd break her Word which 'tis base to suppose even if the Parliament shou'd consent  Who shall absolve us of an Abjuration Oath  Who shall reconcile the Nation to a  French  and Popish Prince The meaning is only Confusion and Distraction and the End will certainly be the destruction of all that shall ever attempt it and therefore I think it as kind a piece of Counsel as can be given  Gentlemen have a Care  for you will certainly miscarry in the Attempt Popery and Slavery will never go down with this Nation Popery is so formidable a thing that the very Name of it wou'd set the whole Nation in an Uproar Those that do not understand it hate it by Tradition and I believe there is a hundred thousand plain CountryFellows in  England  wou'd spend their Blood against  Popery    that do not know whether it be a Man or a Horse  Let such People therefore  have a Care  the People of  England  provok'd are not easily appeas'd Let them remember the Consternation they were in Years ago when the Resentment of the People of  England  hung over the Heads of a whole Party And let them rest assur'd  The Act of Settlement and Limitation of the Crown with the Recognition of the Peoples Rights are the very things the War the Revolution and the Dismission of King  James  were made for These were the Port the whole Nation steer'd for and  this Nation will never part with them  Now  they are safe  they can never have any Tyrant  but by their own Consent  and if they are Slaves again they must do it themselves and  no body will pity them  The next sort of People to whom these Sheets are directed by way of Caution or Advice are  First  The late Ministry  To you Gentlemen the Author directs himself without any thing of Satyr which considering how you treated him you might reasonably expect but stating your Case as it really is refers you to your selves to reflect upon the profound Policy of your Ways  Her Majesty taking you for wise Men as well as honest Men comcommitted to your Conduct the guiding of her Affairs War abroad  Peace at home Her Majesty's Glory the Nation's Happiness were all in your Power You had what  Solomon  calls a Price put into your Hands and  Solomon  not I shall tell you what you ought to be thought for not making such Improvement of it as God and the Nation expected from you  That you were the honest Men the Queen expected you to be let the Answers you gave to the Proposals for relieving the  Camisars  the Expedition to  Cadiz  the Management of the VictualingOffice the Army and Navy in too many Particulars to be innumerated here speak for you if they can the Forfeiture of your Honour and Word on sundry Occasions the Conniv'd Correspondencies with the Enemy and the like let them answer for the Matter That your Consummate Wisdom deceiv'd her Majesty whose Goodness had Entertain'd better Thoughts of you than your Merit gave Reason for will too plainly appear in the weak Attempts made to cover the farther Dishonesty of your Designs in pushing this Nation into all manner of Feuds Heats Animosities and Strife of Parties to the no small Confusion of the Publick Affairs and hazarding the Publick Peace  How you would have extricated her Majesty and this Nation out of the Labyrints of Error and the Impolicies you were driving the Publick Affairs into we thank her Majesty's Prudence that she did not think fit to expect not thinking it safe to run the risque of calling you Fools at the Price of some Mischiefs too gross to be born with and too late to be remedied  It is sufficient that her Majesty finding both the Dishonesty and Folly of your Management and foreseeing the precipiece on which you had brought the Public Affairs had both the Wisdom and the Courage to take the Reins out of your Hands before you had quite overturn'd the Chariot of the State and before you had hurried both us and your selves into Gulfs of irretrievable Confusions  The humble Advice of the Author of these Sheets to you is To sit down and be quiet thank God on your Knees Night and Day that you had a mild a merciful and a gentle Mistress that let you fall softly and did not tye the Weight of the Law to your Heels which would have sunk you to the Bottom of that Gulf in which false Favourites have generally fallen in all Ages of the World  Thank God and the Queen That Her Majesty did not give you time to ruia your selves but took the Knife out of your Hand before you did that Mischief with it that must at last have fallen with a double Weight on your own Heads  Madmen and Fools are always taken care of by their Friends mischievous Weapons taken from them and if they are not peaceably dispos'd are frequently lock'd up from any Capacity of injuring themselves or others  Her Majesty could never have answer'd it to her own known Prudence and Judgment to have committed the Power of your own Ruin and the Nation's Disturbance any longer to you For when once the StateFrenzy appear'd and all the fatal PlagueTokens of Lunacy and National Distraction  broke out in your Behaviour the Queen as a true Nursing Mother to you gave you a Recess from Public Employment that you might have time to shave your Understandings discipline your Tempers and put your politick Capacities under a Course of State Physick might recover your Senses a little and if possible with Time and Reflections come to your selves again  How kind has her Majesty been to you Gentlemen that when you had absolutely hang'd your selves in the StateNoose had actually tied the Rope of Causes and Consequences about your Necks and had you gone on but a few moments more must have been hamper'd irretrievably and been quite strangl'd with the Extension of your own Politicks at once the kind hand of your Sovereign cut you down before your breath was quite gone brought you to Life again and delivered you from those dangerous Wildernesses and Mazes of StateAffairs the Conduct of which you never understood and has now given you the Happiness of a calm Recess and fair Warning not to meddle any more with Things out of your Sphere  Keep the Anniversary of your Deliverance Gentlemen and let it never be forgotten Remember it with Thankfulness to the Queen to the Glory of her Majesty's Lenity and Tenderness and think sometimes how impossible it had been but that the Mischiefs and Distractions you were pushing this Nation upon must have ended in Committing you  the Instruments of it  to the Hands of that Justice which some of you by the unexpected Happiness of RevolutionClemency had the good Fortune to escape from once before  My third Advice is to the Church of  England  Possibly the Clergy may disdain to be advis'd at least by me as Persons whose Province it is to give not receive Admonition But none ought to refuse Advice but he that has never been mistaken  and I hope Gentlemen you will not pretend to be the Men  You have now your Day  as  Ashton  said lately    every Body has  The Queen has declared her self of your Side and that tho' others shall have her Protection you shall have her Favour  The humble Advice to you Gentlemen is  First  To Deserve it  Secondly  Be contented with it  Deserve it by being Faithful to her and to your Native Country for 'tis a most certain Truth no Man can be a Faithful Subject to the Queen who is not intirely in the Interest of his Native Country  By this I mean for I desire to be understood No Man can be a Faithful Subject to the present Queen and deserve her Favour who designs or desires to overthrow the Peace of the Nation she Governs to overthrow the Foundation on which it stands that wou'd endeavour to bring in a Popish Race to Reign over us and consequently involve the Nation in Blood and Confusion 'Tis not enough to say they design no Alteration during the Queen's Life but to keep out Foreigners There is nothing so Foreign to this Nation as Popery The Church of  England  were the Men which threw it out and how it can be that the Church of  England  Men shou'd run a Venture of its returning is past my Understanding  'Tis true every thing that is done by the Members of the Church of  England  is not done by the Church a lame Shift lately made use of by a certain Gentleman to throw off the Scandal of PassiveObedience  But with submission to that Gentleman he might have answer'd the Author of the New Test of the Church's Loyalty better than so or he had as good have said nothing For I think in Arguing we may take the Principles of a Church from the Writings of her Doctors who are the Explainers of them as well as from her Confession of Faith Now he owns that the Doctors of the Church have Preached such a Doctrine if it be a Doctrine not agreeable to the Canon then they ought to have been reprov'd by the Diocesan and Punished by Suspension or otherwise But however 'tis sufficient to the Argument  and therefore the Distinction was needless  that whether it is an Article of the Church's Faith or no 'tis a Doctrine was Preach'd by the Learned Doctors of the Church universally received by the Members of the Church defended openly profess'd and acknowledg'd by those Gentlemen that have been and are still esteem'd Fathers and Pillars of the Church and this is sufficient to the Point  Now in this respect what is done by the Members of the Church of  England  and none else is in the Sense of the Argument done by the Church tho' it be not a publick Act of Convocation or an Act of Delegates from the Church  In this Sense the Church of  England  Deposed K  James  and yet they never made an Act of Convocation for it but 'twas the Church of  England  part of the Nation did it and thus I am to be understood here without putting any one to the Trouble of Exercising his Logick upon the Point  In this Sense too I desire to be understood of the Church of  England  in all I shall say of 'em or to 'em I am not Discussing their Articles of Faith I like them very well and wish they wou'd stick close to them themselves nor am I singling out their Clergy to Reproach them with their Immoralities of which perhaps there may be cause enough  aye    and in other Clergy too  but I'm directing my discourse to the whole Body of this Nation who call themselves of the Church of  England  and 'tis to them I say that whoever goes about to Introduce a Popish Succession to the Crown of this Protestant Nation whosoever designs to restore the Abdicated Line of the late King can't deserve the Favour which her Majesty has promis'd them and which I can't but suppose she promis'd them  with a SubIntelligitur  of their Faithfulness to her and the Nation  The Protestant Succession is the Foundation on which her Majesty and the Nation now stands and without which they cannon stand of which may be said without Prophaneness as is said of the Gospel  other Foundation can no Man lay than that which is laid  As I would advise the Church of  England  to deserve this Favour of their Prince so I advise them to be contented with it  It seems a Manifest Affront to the Queen's Declaration that when she has promis'd them her Favour and the Dissenters her Protection they shou'd  not be contented with the First without depriving tother of the Last What shall we say that while the Queen declares she will protect her Dissenting Subjects in their Liberty of Worship it shall be hindred from the Pulpit and afterwards from the Collegiate Press at  Oxford  that 'tis the Duty of all true Chur of  England  Men to Erect a Flag of Defiance against the Dissenters or Phanaticks till they are Rooted from off the Face of the Land Why what's the matter Gentlemen won't you let the Queen keep her Word with them she has promised upon her Royal Word to preserve the Toleration and you declare she shall not This is very scoundrel usage of her Majesty and a sorry return for the Favour she has promis'd you I question not but you will come in with the Shift just now mentioned That this is not an Act of the Church of  England  but Gentlemen as you ought to be asham'd of it let us see you Correct it or else we suppose your tacit acknowledgments is an Assent  Here are in  England  by a modest Estimation above two Millions of Dissenters I would fain ask the hottest headed Church of  England  Man in Town what he wou'd have done with them  Hang'd  all  Hang'd    says furioso  Ay Sir if you cou'd fight as well as talk it may be you might do it  But they won't be Hang'd  and how will you make them 'twas try'd once and nothing was got by it but Blows and that Two for One  Suppose you would Banish them and  Suppose they wou'd go  'twou'd Ruin you all to part with them See what a Condition  Spain  brought it self to by sending Families of Marescoes away  They're not only Numerous but Wealthy your Trade wou'd remove with 'em they'd carry with 'em so much of your Cash and Wealth you'd be in a worse Case than the  Israelites  left the  Egyptian  Ladies in without their Jewels  I cannot see the Policy of the Church of  England  Men in suppressing the Dissenters 'tis certainly more for the Nations Good to Unite all Parties there can be but one thing in it Convert them they can't I never read of any Conversion brought about by Persecution but in  France  and what are New Converts turn'd to only to submit for Fear  Now without pretending to Prophesy I may say the Dissenters in  England  are not to be brought to that the only thing that remains is they wou'd have the restraint of the Law taken off that they may be loose upon them to harrass and plunder them this is what is aim'd at  Well Gentlemen when you have this Liberty you dare not put it in Practice further than the Law will give you leave if you do the Law gives them leave to resist you and in either there is half your own Party will be against you Nay those who are properly the Ch of  England  will be against it all the Men of Honour Conscience Charity and Mercy will be against harrassing and dragging their Neighbours about for Points of Conscience Nay the Mob of your own Party will stone your Informers and who are you that are left if the other shou'd stand Neuter can you Force the  Queen to break her Word are ye able to fright her into it and if you cou'd when you have driven all the Nation into Confusion can you defend your selves against the Laws and the Party  To what purpose than is all this Huffing is it not only that you want to be Plundring your Neighbours Why if you are for Plunder take Arms a God's Name and go and Plunder the FrenchBut I ask Pardon I forgot your Principles  you are for Plunder without Fighting  The farther Confirmation of this Advice is drawn from the plain Conviction which the powerful Arguments of Peace Temper and Moderation have forc'd on the Minds of Men  You now see Gentlemen the Queen the Head of your own Church the Bishops a numerous part of your own Body the Men of the Gown they are all convinc'd  'Tis impossible for Wise Men to resist Demonstration the consequence of things has brought I had almost said all the Wise Men of the Church and I would to God it were true to see the absolute necessity of Peace to see that a Union of Parties is the only step to this Nations Settlement that a Recess from Party Rage and healing the Wounds of the State is the only Method to prevent the Nations falling into Convulsions Feavers Calenturs and Death  And why Gentlemen will you stand out it were to be wish'd you would a little consider how is it possible you can Erect your own Judgments against a whole Nation the Queen the Nobility Thousands of your best Parishoners born bred in and ever true to the Church are convinc'd and will you not be mov'd to Examine the Case  What prospect of Injury or Mischief can you see in Peace what damage can accrue to the Church or State to put but a Negative upon your Zeal and not suffer it to outrun the Law or Fight with your knowledge  As you Love the Church your Prince and your Country listen to Peace listen to the Voice of the Nation and of the Queen and the Voice of Reason and the Nature of the things all concur to call upon you to Unite with your Brethren and no more let small things divide us no more let our Enemies beat us with our own Hands and destroy us by our own Assistance  If you will not give Ear to this Cordial Advice give the Author leave to determine two Things which without any pretence to the Spirit of Prophesy he thinks he may presume to assure you of  This Nation whose Eyes are now open to their own Safety and Deliverance will do the Work without you the People of  England  aided by the Laws encouraged by the Nobility the principal Gentry a great Body of the Clergy and back'd by the Queen joining in this mighty work this glorious attempt to establish a Party Peace will do the work without you  You will fix this Eternal Brand of Infamy on the  English  Clergy that they were the principal Opposers of the Nation's Peace that in Contempt  of the Blessed healing and heavenly Spirit of Peace in spight of the Royal Exhortations and Invitations of their Sovereign in Defiance of the noble Example of their Brethren they even they only are at this Day the wideners of our Breaches the Encouragers of Divisions and the daily prompters of the Ignorant People to abhor their Brethren to hate their Neighbours and to keep up the unnatural Divisions of this Nation  A blessed  Memorandum  this will be to the Honour and Glory of our Inferiour Clergy to remain to Posterity when our Children shall say We had been a happy Nation if the Clergy of the Church had not hindred the general Peace in when the Queen the Nobility the Gentry nay and the very Bishops offer'd to join in a happy Union when they all invited them to it when all Circumstances concurr'd to make them easy and when the want of it let in Slavery and Bondage upon our Fathers and entailed it upon us their Postery  To the moderate Gentlemen of the Church the Author of this sees but little Occasion to speak the whole need not the Physicians he that is in the right Way needs no Guide Peace has brought some Scandal upon you but 'tis from such Mouths whose Breath is all Scandal and whose Throaths is an open Sepulchre  Pursue Gentlemen with the same Courage and Candor the same happy Resolutions and successful Measures you have begun how easy is the Work of Peace in  England  when by wise Hands back with the Encouragement of Power it is once set on foot  Go on Gentlemen with Success Peace is always the first Act of wise Counsels What Confusions have our State Mountebanks runs us into Our  N  ms  our  S  mours    H  s    B  ms    Gra  ls    Ro  rs  and the Rabble of  Jehu  's Polititians whither were they hurrying this Nation by Civil Confusions while at the same time we were involv'd in a cruel a formidable and threatning War abroad  You have rescued the Nation God Almighty by infusing Principles of Peace Moderation Union and Temper into the Heads and Hearts of the Queen and you has sav'd us from the Ruin contriv'd for us by the Devil and unwarily propogated  to treat them with Charity  by our own Impolitick and thoughless Managers  The Dissenters  are another Branch of those who this Author with submission to their politicks thinks may accept of some Advice tho' perhaps they may be of another Opinion  However whether they will hear or forbear he takes the Freedom to speak to them tho' in general only referring a further Explication of his Meaning to another place  You have always and above all Parties pretended to peace Now shew the reality of your Design  You are divided in some Steps which  you think needful  from the Church let the Spirit of Charity remain and divide no farther than you really know to be needful  In Matters of Religion enjoying your Liberty be content with it and study to let there be no more Difference between you and the Church than there really is  We are all Christians all Protestants all Englishmen let us be all Brethren and act like such on all Occasions  The Church of  England  and the Dissenters have but one Interest one Foundation and but one End The Moderate ChurchMen and the charitable Dissenter are the same Denomination of Christians and all the Difference which now lookt at near the Eye shows large if view'd at the distance of Heaven shows not it self neither will Catholick Christianity in that Realm of Light appear in any Partycolour'd Garment  In Civil Affairs 'tis your Interest your Safety and your Glory that the Government should be in the Church of  England  and even this is a Security to the Dissenters against all that Clamour rais'd at them of their pulling down the Church The Dissenters cannot wish the Downfal of the Church of  England  Governments without proving themselves Lunatick and all the Sense of their own Interest must forsake them  In all Occasions therefore with all possible chearfulness join with the Men of Peace of the Church carefully choose them to represent you boldly rescue them from the Scandals and Calumnies of their own Clamouring high Party and heartily assist them upon all Occasions in their honest and just Endeavours for the Nation's Security  What if every body you suspect or dislike is not turn'd out or every body you like put in What if Her Majesty is willing to try some Men longer than others and give Knaves an Opportunity to turn honest what if the Revolution of  England  from Madmen and Fools in the Ministry to honest and wise Men be acted like the Moderation we recommend with Temper sedately gradually and with due Consideration to Circumstances Being once fully satisfy'd with the sincere Resolution of the Queen and Ministry to pursue the Nation's Peace acquiesce in Her Majesties Methods Her Designs being so just fear not but the Methods will be as judicious Our Saviour's Redemption was all compleat tho' he did not Answer the hasty Expectation of the Disciples who thought he must needs  just then  restore the Kingdom of  Israel  The Queen has sufficiently declar'd Her glorious Resolution for Peace pray let us leave Her Majesty to Her own Methods It is not two Year ago since we we should have thought our selves happy with what we now see let us look on our present Liberty and Peace with Satisfaction and wait with Joy and Pleasure for the Remainder which in its Time and Season we have great Reason to hope will be perfected to the Settlement of that lasting Calm in these Nations which Good Men have so long pray'd for  FINIS
