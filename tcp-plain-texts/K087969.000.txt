explanatory of great and important events And so great and important do I consider the discovery of this precious fragment of history which I now give to the public that I am persuaded I need offer no apology for minutely relating the manner in which it so accidentally and so happily fell into my hands  My father having having pursued the profession of a pinmaker with great success acquired a very handsome fortune with which he purchased  GrubHatch  the  ancient seat of the family of the  Polesworths  At his death I succeeded to that estate and wishing to live as became a person of my  rank  and  fortune  I determined like other young  gentlemen  to pull to pieces modernise and adorn so  commodious  but so  antiquated  a house  Unluckily I was not acquainted with any fashionable architect and was determined not to be so  vulgar  as to employ a  city surveyor  I concluded therefore that my best way was to consult my  Cook Maid  upon this occasion who I had always found to be a very shrewd sensible woman and who besides had a damned good taste of her own Accordingly having mentioned the subject to her one day she told me That she had formerly lived with a family in Marylebone and that in one of the streets there she remembered to have seen a very  tasty  house built on a  new principle  by a very famous and fashionable  Architector  whose name she had forgot but she remembered to have often admired his house as being uncommonly  crips and nic't  and not in the least like a  dwelling house  for it looked for all the world like a chapel From this account which pleased me I determined to enquire after this great artist and having gone on purpose to look at his house I saw it answered precisely to my  cook maid's  description I next went to look at an addition by him made to a great man's house adjoining to the river and from the skill and dexterity with which I observed the artist had there avoided all regularity proportion taste and elegance I concluded he must have a perfect knowledge of his art to enable him to deviate from all its rules and all its beauties with such ingenuity and correctness I did not therefore hezitate a moment in determining that this was the proper person for me to employ  Accordingly he came to my house and gave me a monstruous beautiful design for taking away all my old towers turrets and battlements and every thing else which gavemy house an appearance of antiquity  or of old fashioned magnificence and in their stead he substituted venetian and palladian windows ballustrades and pilasters and in short every thing that is handsome modern and tonish I was perfectly charmed with all this when an accident happened which had nearly made me frantic and curse my architect for an illiterate booby who deserved to be buried in one of his deepest foundations  I am sure the public will forgive my rage when I relate that one day my workmen in pulling down part of a round tower came to a small concealed closet in the wall in which was lodged a very old iron chest with a rusty padlock upon it  They immediately concluded they had found a treasure and proposed to take an oath of secrecy to each other respecting the contentsbut one of them cried out  "Damn it let us first see if there is any thing in the chest worth swearing about  let us open him and examine his belly"  This they did by striking off the padlock when upon lifting up the lidlo there was nothing to be found but a parcel of old musty papers in manuscript much decayed from age very damp and almost perished for want of air At this critical moment my architect entering the tower enquired of the workmen what they were about They being extremely disappointed at neither finding gold nor silver told him they had just discovered a parcel of old dirty papers not worth a td Let me see them says he and then turning over some leaves he reads on the title page  "The history of  John Bull  "  but the ignorant nincompoop never having before heard of the name of that illustrious person exclaimed  "Ay this is a cock and a bull story indeed"  And reading still farther he came to those beautiful and well selected lines of Ovid upon which he observed  "That this was some damned greek or latin jargon"  which he thanked God he knew nothing about  "and therefore  says he as the paper is very  nice  and  soft  I will carry it to town with me and shall do what perhaps the author could not have done for himself for I shall certainly transmit his work to  posterity  "  Having pronounced this witticism with an air of selfapplause he began to bundle up his papers when by the most accidental stroke of good luck I came sauntering into the place  "What have you got here"  good Sir says I  "Nothing worth looking at"  replied the artist telling me at the same time where and how these old fusty papers as he was pleased to call them had been discovered This raised my curiosity and having read the title page and the learned historian's quotation from Ovid I jumped for joy and exclaimed  "By God I have found a treasure"  upon this I observed both my architect and workmen began to stare at me and at oneanother like so many stuck pigs At length the artist addressing himself to me  "Are these Sir"  said he  Title deeds which we have now discovered"  "Title  devils"  replied I  you had nearly ruined me by your ignorance but thank God I came in time to save this valuable work"  and then collecting the mouldy sheets away I capered to my study in a transport of joy and immediately set myself down to read over this admirable performance  I soon perceived that the air began to have a sensible effect upon the sheets of my manuscript as they became so tender it was with difficulty they could bear turnning over I was therefore under the necessity to set about transcribing the whole with great care and fidelity altering not a word nor a syllable nor even a letter of this excellent and justly admired historian  I may therefore boast with great truth that such as I found it I give it to the world uninjured unaltered unimpaired At what time this fragment was originally wrote I leave to the conjectures and investigation of the learned and ingenious Neither shall I pretend to decide what period of the life and transactions of  the illustrious  John Bull  is here narrated I do not mean to indulge conjecture Our historian has himself hinted that he treats of a period of that great man's existence when he was rather verging towards dotage Indeed the inconsistency of his conduct as here related with the whole tenor of his former life and conversation affords but too good ground to justify our author's observation Nor does even his nuptials with the young the proud the haughty and assuming Miss Prerogative in any way disprove but rather confirms what our author has advanced  But what above all serves to establish this fact is the visible decline of that great man's mental faculties to that degree as to allow himself to be compleatly deceived and led blindfold by the nurse of whom he was wont to entertain so rooted a jealousy and to permit her without opposition to employ for his steward an ignorant school boy altogether unacquainted with mankind and unskilled in  businessAnd this at a time when  John  's affairs were much embroiled and his finances almost exhausted by continual expensive and vexatious litigations So that really if there was in his family one man with more wisdom experience and knowledge than another this was undoubtedly the time to have called for an exertion of his abilities  Be that as it may we all know that  John  's great failings from his infancy were rashness and precipitancy and that he was credulous to a degree scarcely consistent with common sense These foibles exposed him sadly to the malicious and fabricated reports of talebearers gossips slanderers and liars and are prominent features of his character which our author has here most admirably depicted  I once proposed to have presented the english reader with a translation of our author's quotation from Ovid but not finding myself quite equal to the task I applied to our parson who is reckoned a  very  pretty  scholar However his version did not altogether please me and I dropped my design He for instance had translated  Occasus Ireland  and  Ortus  the  EastIndies  This I objected to observing that although Ovid might very probably have heard of the  EastIndies  yet I could not imagine that he had ever heard or read much about  Ireland  And for this and other reasons I determined to lay aside all thoughts of an English version  I have only farther to add that although I have considered it as a pious duty which I owed to the manes of so great an historian to give his work to the public without hazarding the smallest alteration yet I am not so blinded by the brilliant merit of this celebrated writer as not to confess that many inaccuracies have crept into his work which in candour and fairness we ought surely to attribute to his not having had sufficient leisure before his death to reduce it into a state of finished correctness We must therefore view this little fragment of history as the precious and spirited  sketch of a great painter which had not yet received the last and most corrective strokes of his pencil and where unhappily for mankind too few of the wished for  pentimenti  appear and where still more unhappily the ample canvas is left unfilled with the grand and glorious composition  If the perusal of this curious and interesting fragment should afford as much entertainment and satisfaction to the public as it has done to me I shall esteem myself amply rewarded for all my trouble in the publication  PEREGRINE PINFOLD  GrubHatch  April  THE DEDICATION To the Rt Hon William Pitt First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer c c c  Most sublime and wonderful SIR  I Once intended to have given to the Public the following fragment of the history of that most excellent and eminent tradesman  John Bull  Esq  without seeking for any great or powerful patron under whose protection it might be ushered into the world with greater lustre and eclat I had indeed almost persuaded myself that so authentic an history of that great man written by so admirable an author as  Sir Humphry Polesworth  whose  character as an able and faithful historian has been long established beyond all the effort of cavil and criticism could not require any such extraordinary recommendation to a nation of tradesmen whose chief glory consists in having like the celebrated  John Bull  made their way thro' all difficulties by a most assiduous and laborious industry  But whilst I was ruminating upon this matter it suggested itself to my imagination that it would be much more fashionable to prefix a dedication to this most inestimable workFashion sir which has such influence over great minds at once determined me and I could not help recollecting with pleasure that even you yourself was during last session of parliament prompted by this powerful motive to save the national credit by paying the navy and victualling billholders at par which no other consideration on earth but fashion could have induced you to have done  This sir has also prevailed upon me to attempt this daring measure of dedication But how to approach you in terms of adequate eulogy is that which creates my greatest difficulty I am sensible that I cannot possibly say any thing very new upon a subject where you yourself and so many other ingenious statesmen and orators have been exhausting  all  the most pompous expressions and fulsome figures to bestow praise  In this dangerous situation coming over t  lfsame ground I am afraid I may  ntly incur the reproach of plagi  sm Sir Richard Hill for instance that sublime Prophet Preacher and Poet has unhappily anticipated a very grand idea which I had formed concerning you and which indeed neither he nor I need to plume ourselves much upon since it must be obvious and will naturally occur to every one who will give themselves a moment's reflection I mean that sublime  idea by him so beautifully expressed  "That Old England and the Son of Old Chatham must fall together"  It is indeed a very true but a very mortifying consideration to think that both these melancholly events cannot be at any great distance  Durum sed levius fit patientia  Quidquid corrigere est nefas  But great sir allow me to say that however true and however sublime this idea yet was it extremely imprudent in our friend Sir Richard to have mentioned this matter in so public an assembly when it is well known that there is one Person in the kingdom still greater than yourself who may have taken the alarm at this position and who I verily believe would be the most miserable of mankind did he consider you as a fixture to the premises not moveable at pleasure The very essence of authority for which he has been struggling with so much zeal  vigour and duplicity ever since you was born  Besides by thus divulging the grand arcanum of the empire the worthy baronet has exposed us to our enemies who I have no doubt should you fall would be ready to invade us by sea and land nay perhaps by air thus rendering by means of balloons our insular situation no security against our aerostatic foes  But while I thus descant upon your amazing utility to the state I forget the principal purport of this dedication which was to declare to you that you may depend upon me as being attached to you and you alone for the rest of my life unless any thing of greater advantage than your patronage should tempt me to seek for protection elsewhere In which case I am sure even your little knowledge of mankind will prevent you from expecting any farther friendship from me Indeed almost all of your present fast friends  may from past experience teach you this important lesson The Treasurer of the Navy after trying all parties clings to you as most useful to himself and  to the state  The Lord Chancellor Lord Gower the Duke of Richmond the Rat Catcher and all Lord North's quondam band of  illustrious contractors  understand this maxim compleatly and permit me to add the greatest of all examples virtuous and immaculate sir that you yourself when interest and ambition lead the way can wheel from privilege to prerogative with a crane neck on a new principle by letters patent  under the Great Seal  And what was so well said of a former popular minister in this country may with equal justice be applied to your immaculate Self  Now he'll command and now obey  Bellows for liberty today  And roars for power tomorrow  But again I forget myself on this bewitching subjectI forget that I write a dedication and allow myself to be hurried down the rapid stream of dissertation Permit me only to add in your own classical and elegant stile that if I have missed any portion of praise I should have bestowed I do assure you it was not from any intention of  blinking  this favorite subjectConsider it great Sir as a mark of my impotence rather than any failure of my desires  I have the honor to be with the most profound veneration and adoration divine and immaculate SIR your most devoted and obsequious servant PEREGRINE PINFOLD  CONTENTS  PART IV  EXORDIUM to

period of the history of the admirable and inimitable  John Bull  which teems with the greatest and most interesting events of that great man's life I should think myself perfectly inexcusable if in imitation of other celebrated historians I did not here pause in order to inform my gentle reader that I am highly sensible of the dignity and importance of my subject and that no pains have been wanting on my part to search for truth wherever she could be found I have not only examined every author who has treated of these complicated transactions but I have conversed with many persons of great consequence in  John Bull  's own family and have compared  their accounts with what I found narrated in the annals and other authentic records of the times carefully rejecting what appeared to me either false or spurious  Barely to mention the numberless volumes which I have found it necessary to consultThe pamphlets magazines newspapersspeeches never spokenstatutes never understood those which have been repealed and those which ought never to have passedpetitions remonstrances representations and addressesThe ballads songs squibs and epigramsBarely to enumerate these learned authorities would form a catalogue as voluminous as my history itself and might appear in me an effect of extreme ostentation and a vain parade of science which I would at all times wish to avoidWhether I have succeeded in accomplishing this great and important task with skill and ability becomes not me to determine but I shall certainly await the decision of a well informed public with a  long  and  respectful  silence  CHAPTER I  John Bull's ageHis pensive and sensible soliloquySome prominent features of his character described  JOHN BULL  was now arrived at that time of life when people begin to suspect that some of the follies incident to human nature may not improperly be imputed to a sort of premature dotage Be that as it may there was no person of acute penetration but might perceive that this great and good man was rather verging towards the wane of lifeThe tedious irksome and unsuccessfull lawsuit which he had carried on with his ungrateful and rascally tenants in the west country who in order to cast  John  had been supplied both with cash and with counsel by his old and inveterate enemy  Louis Baboon  and others had fretted  John  to the very guts and then the disgraceful manner in which that business had been compromised by  Malagrida  his late steward had hurt his feelings very much For to say truth  John  was e'en as humane a good hearted fellow as you would see amongst a thousand He was frequently seen walking in a pensive mood backwards and forwards through his  hall at  Bullock's hatch  and was often overheard muttering to himself somewhat to the following purposse  Zounds My people might at least have taken some care of those poor tenan's of mine in the west country who really befriended my cause but to leave them to be turned out of their farmsTo be dragged from their houses and homes nay even to have many of their throats cut by those inhuman and lawless banditti their neighbours appears to me a most shocking businessOh  John BullJohn Bull  thou art sadly disgraced by thy servantsBut damn it what could I expect from that infamous hardened scoundrel  Malagrida  I suppose he found it necessary for himself that matters should be made upNo doubt he and his associate that supple loon  Harry Mac Bumbo  have filled their pockets by it  Well I do really think one of the best things ever my poor wife did for me was the dismissing of those knaves from my service I know the nurse has a sort of sneaking kindness for that fellow  Malagrida  for he has a cursed artful wheedling tongue can flatter ye by the hour and lie like the very devilWhen it serves his purposeFor my own part I can't  say I ever had a good opinion of the dogI like people of my own temperfair open and above board nothing hidden or concealed At the same time I must confess I am so far of the nurse's way of thinking that it appears to me a very ridiculous thing to see my old friends  Boreas  and young  Renard  so cordial and shaking hands together after giving one another the lye so often in my wife's hearing and calling one another all the bad names they could invent This to be sure is somewhat very extraordinary and almost convinces me that these gentry fall in and fall out just as their own interest directs them without much minding my good or that of my family I believe verily they are all rogues together that I take to be the plain English of itNot but that I must needs confess I think both  Boreas  and  Renard  are very clever fellows as any ever I had within my doors  Boreas  I always took to be a good humoured droll facetious fellow with a vast of wit great parts and great experience in my affairs and had always a deal to say for himself He was once as well with the nurse as any man alive that is while the obeyed all her orders implicitly much against his own inclination But now I know she hates him like the devil for his junction with  Renard  and the more he acts like a man of honour in his new connection she will like him the worsefor she's a proud obstinate vindictive old b as ever existed Well hang her if I care a damn whether she's pleased or no if they agree so as to manage my affairs to good purpose for I am sure they never required more care attention and ability than at present to get me out of the cursed scrape I am now in for which I have to thank her pride and obstinacy and be damned to her leading me in to all this foolish absurd litigation with such a set of rascally ungrateful scoundrelsAnd now I have got a compleat verdict against me with exorbitant costs of fuit and where all this immense sum is to come from God only knows  Thus  John  went on in a soliloquy that had no end when he was in these gloomy pensive moods and these recurred but too frequently of late for he really felt his situation grievous unsuccessful in his lawsuit and up to the eyes in debt What was his only confort and I sincerely believe he felt it as a real comfort at this time was to think that his affairs were now both in active and able hands for although he was at first somewhat hurt at the  sudden coalition of  Boreas  and  Renard  yet he was soon reconciled to it and used to confess what was true that it was very much his own temper to forgive injuries and forget animosities  "I can easily suppose says he that being both open frank and good humoured they have agreed to meet with some mutual friends over a bottle and to shake hands and forget all former quarrels"  Besides says  John  "My wife who is a very discreet sensible woman has a high opinion of them both and has frequently told me she was perfectly sure that it was their sincere affection for me that prompted them to so unexpected a reconciliation for that they could not bear to see my affairs so bungled and bedeviled as they were by that sad dog  Malagrida  and his profligate associate  Harry Mac Bumbo  with young  Pam  his apprentice"  Such was the language which  John Bull  used to hold once and again on this subject But alas his satisfaction and peace of mind were not long lived as we shall see by the sequel of this useful and authentic history  For there it will be found that though  John Bull  was as sensible and as well meaning a tradesman as any you would wish to see or converse withal and one who understood his  own business thoroughly and had a sort of a smatter of every thingYet had he a most unfortunate temper for his own interest by which means he often marred the best concerted plans and even so it happened now  John  with a very large share of good sense was of all mankind the most credulous You could by art and persuasion and a competent portion of effrontery make him swallow down any thing however absurd and improbable This unlucky temper had made  John  the constant dupe of every quack of every profession who could get acquainted with him Should any man say and assert it boldly that he could go into a quart bottle  John  would immediately give ear to it Ay and would have rode or run a hundred miles to have seen this admirable trick performed If another would pretend that he could pay off all his debts in the course of a few years  John  would gape and listen to him with the greatest attention  This foible of  John  's was well known in the family and not this foible only otherwise it might have passed unnoticed as not being attended with any very bad consequences but added to this  John  was of that violent and precipitate temper that without the least examination into the reasonableness or truth or  probability of what he heard he would immediately set to work and enter upon the execution of any new project with as much ardour and zeal as if he had the best authority for it Nor would he hear a single syllable from any friend who advised him to think of the matter and to take time to deliberate and consider what he was about Many a scoundrel had taken great advantage of these failings to their own emolument and  John  's disgrace Yet he never grew wiser from experience but the next comer that would talk beg enough and boast of his own knowledge and talents was sure to meet the most favorable reception from  John  who swallowed every species of rodomontade as if it had been gospel and never would give himself time to reflect on the consequences of such egregious folly and nonsense  CHAP II  Boreas  and  Renard  set themselves in good earnest to arrange  John Bull's  affairs Short His+tory of the East country clerksTheir extreme vigilance and avarice describedSerious intention to cleanse the countinghouse which is prevented by  John Bull's  nurse  NOT only the senfible and thinking part of  John Bull  's own family but likewise all the neighbours to a man agreed that he had been extremely lucky in having his affairs put into such able hands as those of  Boreas  and  Renard  and those who really wished him well were happy in congratulating him upon this event an event which he owed entirely to the good sense prudence and discretion of Mrs  Bull  who in every action of her life had shown great dignity and independence and an unremitting zeal for her husband's welfareNobody knew better than her the embarrassed situation of  John  's affairs and it was universally allowed that she could not have put them into better or abler hands than into those of  Boreas  and  Renard  who to their talents and experience added great zeal to exert themselves in arranging  John  's finances in settling his  books ballancing his accompts and in extending and regulating his trade But what most of all required their immediate attention was the strange business and abuses that had crept into  John  's counting house where a set of his clerks had been carrying on a rare spot of work and finding that  John  was too much engaged in law to give them any great attention they had entered into the saddest scenes of peculation plunder knavery and oppression that ever were heard of in a christian country These fellows contrived a plan by which they thought they might be considerable gainers without hurting  John  in the smallest degree Observing therefore that there was a set of lazy lubbardly Eastcountry squires who were not cleverly supplied with  John  's goods and who had also many commodities the produce of their farms which they imagined would be useful to  John  in return they proposed to take the carrying on this traffic off  John  's hands to free him from the trouble and expence of it promising at the same time to bring the whole produce and profits to  Bullock  's  hatch  by which not only they but also  John  himself would reap very great advantage  This project pleased  John  hugely and his wife still more for the ladies are always captivated by wonderful adventures and romantic and difficult exploits which I am convinced may have been partly the cause of their great and ardent desire of travelling into  Scotland  with so much rapidity and eagerness as has often happened in former times  John Bull  and his wife were therefore perfectly agreed in granting to these same crafty clerks an exclusive privilege to carry on this traffic with the aforesaid 'squires To work went the clerks with a greedy industry and traded away at a vast rate till they acquired great riches and a greater name Then it was that many of the young servants about  John  's family wished to be sent out that they also might have opportunities of pushing their fortunes And accordingly great numbers of sprightly younkers were sent who being extremely intent upon the neatest way of filling their purses they bethought themselves that trade was not the only method by which large fortunes could be acquired but that it might be to the full as good and as expeditious a way to get rid of the eastern squires altogether by foul or by fair means no matter which and  so to take possession of their estates for themselves  This succeeded to a miracle for in a short space of time our spirited  Younkers  stabbed some shot others poisoned sold imprisoned betrayed bribed bullied and trampled down to such a pitch that they made themselves absolute masters of whole parishes And so powerful and so rich were they become by this management that nobody in that part of the country and far less at  Bullock'shatch  dared to say a word against them or find any fault whatever with their proceedings  In this way you would often see strange lowlived fellows such as cheesemonger'sboys waiters at taverns alehousekeeper's sons and the like after they had been some years in the east country and being what the  Scots  call sharp loons they would pillage and peculate and plunder and cheat their poor opprest tenantry to such a degree that in the course of two or three years they would return to  Bullock'shatch  with great evergrown fortunes where you might often have seen them strutting about the  hall  and the parlours and giving themselves incredible airs as if  John Bull  himself had been nothing compared with them Nay they were even so amazingly pert and forward from their success that they would have had the impudence to take out a gold pass key which they usually brought home with them and wore in their breeches pocket with which they would at times turn the latch of Mrs  Bull  's chamber door and walk in with the greatest ease and familiarity and would then set themselves down upon the first seat that came in their way without so much as saying with your leave or by your leave If Mrs  Bull  took no notice of them it was nothing to those gentry if she or any of her servants spoke to them they would begin and chatter away as fast as any of the family could do for their hearts or souls  Now it so happened that just at this time those cunning clerks were running a fine career of rapine perfidy and peculation greatly to their own emolument but to the eternal disgrace of  John Bull  and his family In somuch that not only  John  's wife family and friends but likewise all the neighbours were crying shame upon him for not better regulating the conduct of his servants There seemed therefore to be an universal desire in  the family to see an end put to these sad scenes of plunder and oppression devastation and ruin  But nobody was more sensible of the necessity of a reform than  Boreas  and  Renard  Mr  Whigman  the steward a very honest man had it also much at heart and promised all his assistance to carry on this measure Nor did any one about the family pretend more zeal for it than  John  's nurse a person of a very singular character who in order to indulge in one favorite passion could with pleasure sacrifice to it every consideration and compleatly disguise every other feeling of her mind To this ruling passion was owing the part we shall now see her play in  John  's affairs the extraordinary means she used to prevent the proposed reform and the curious steps she took to overset Mr  Whigman Boreas Renard  and the rest of  John  's ablest and most trusty servants  CHAP III  Birth parentage and education of  John Bull's  NurseShe is enraged but dissembles her angerShe determines to trip up the heels of  John's  best servants and thus to gratify her revenge  BEFORE I proceed to this part of my authentic history it is very necessary for the better understanding of future events that I should here relate a few particulars respecting  John Bull  's nurse and the great sway she bore in his family  Mrs  Herenhausen  for that was the name of the nurse was by the father's side of  German  extraction and of an exceeding good family both by father and mother and very sensible was she of it herself and very vain of such preeminence Her father died when she was yet a child and so the care of her education fell to her mother and to one  Sawney Macthane  a queer proud pompous and pedantic fellow formerly of sister  Peg  's family This task  Sawney  undertook with great pleasure and instilled many of his own extravagant and fantastic  notions into the girls headby telling her that she might expect one day or another to have great power in  John Bull  's family and how she ought to manage to drive or lead himand how she ought to have all his servants of her own chusing and never to permit either  John  or his  Wife  to make choice of any  "And if ever it so happens"  said  Sawney  "that they should claim such privileges you should never rest night or day till you can get them dismissed and new ones put in their places for that is the only rule for maintaining absolute power in  John  's family"  And indeed it must be confessed that this maxim of  Sawney  's was not a bad one for procuring and maintaining power in any private family  It fell out just as  Sawney  had foretold for he like many more of  Peg  's family was endued with a curious talent called the second sight In short the  nurse  got a place in  John  's house and she so improved it what from her own natural temper what from  Sawney  's instructions that she soon acquired great sway there and her word passed for a law amongst all the servants who stood much in awe of her and cringed curtsied and bowed to her more than they did to  John Bull  himself  This naturally increased the  nurse  's pride and high notions of her own dignity and importance And  Sawney  's maxim respecting the management of the servants had made such an impression upon her mind that it was never absent from her imagination So that from the love of sway and  John  and his  Wife  's easy tempers the old woman was become extremely insolent imperious and so obstinate withal that you might well see she had a good portion of the  German  blood in her veins  From this arrogance and pride she had first engaged  John  in that fatal lawsuit with his tenants in the  west country  her cursed obstinacy was the cause of its being carried on and her damned passion for choosing every person in  John  's service was the reason why she also took upon her to name  John  's lawyers and attorneys and so furnished him with as compleat a set of rogues and pettyfoggers as any poor litigious man was ever blessed with  Never was there a plainer or clearer case than that of  John  's and if it was necessary to go to law which many sensible men thought neither necessary nor prudent yet certainly the action being once brought and the suit commenced every one must acknowledge  John  was confoundedly ill used by his counsel who run him to immoderate expence without having genius or capacity and without even inclination to take one decisive step that might bring this affair to a fortunate issue  However all those rare gentry were the choice of the nurse and therefore tho'  John  growled he was determined to see it to an end but Mrs  Bull  being at length heartily tired and complaining most grievously of the immoderate expence she was fully determined to bring matters to a speedy conclusionand the nurse seeing she could not help herself employed  Malagrida  to compromise the affair which he did in so scandalous and bungling a manner as both to disgust Mr and Mrs  Bull  which occasioned his disgrace and dismission from his service  Then it was that old  Boreas  and  Renard  determined gloriously to save  John  and the family from more mischief by making up all their former quarrels and forgetting or forgiving past injuries Mrs  Bull  who was as well conditioned a woman as ever lived was extremely happy at this reconciliation for she saw the great advantage it would be of to her husband's affairs But  John  himself was not near so clear about it and used to reason and  growl concerning it exactly in the manner we have described above sometimes he thought it perfectly right sometimes he thought it quite wrong and alledged that it was highly indecent and improper for two goodnatured men to make up their former quarrels in order to serve him and his family  Mrs  Bull  however in this matter judged much more dispassionately and sensibly and knowing the great merit of the parties she strongly recommended their being employed in the future settlement of  John  's affairs which was accordingly done  It is not easy to conceive how much the nurse was enraged at this proceeding for tho' she had been made privy to it and had coldly assented yet she had not been the person to propose the measure In short the proposition came from Mrs  Bull  to whom she had a very great dislike as we shall see more fully hereafter And altho' she had borne her no ill will whatever still it was Mrs  Bull  's and not her own proposal  However as she was from her infancy a perfect mistress of dissimulation she pretended intire satisfaction and acquiescence with all  the family arrangements now taking place affected great good humour and put on the air of compleat reconciliation and complacency  All this time however she harboured vengeance in her mindshe vowed revenge for being naturally extremely vindictive she waited with impatience a favourable opportunity when she might put her designs into execution and soothe her implacable resentment as we shall see by the sequel of this eventful history  CHAPTER IV  The Nurse makes choice of Pam as the instrument of her vengeanceHis education and characterHe converses with Mrs BullIs disconcerted at his cool receptionIs comforted by his Cousin Trim Stutter  THE nurse immediately fixed her eyes upon a young lad bred in  John  's comptinghouse as a fit instrument for her purposed revenge And so he was a very proper agent for her present purposes The young man I mean whose name was  Pam  was son to  Namby Pamby  an eminent  quack  who had practised in the  neighbourhood with great success and had acquired thereby a mighty reputation for cures in desperate cases Certain it is that he was a very impudent presumptuous and pompous fellow and used to harangue the multitude with great effect so that they would stand with their mouths open and swallow down for gospel all his hubble bubble jargonIf says he there are any distempers raging in  America  I will cure them  "by ordering some large doses of my pills to be sent over to  Germany  "  This sort of rodomantade nobody understood and to be sure nobody could understandand yet it was swallowed down with wonderful avidity by the populace who admired the bold asseverations of the man and even gave him credit for his unparralelled effrontery Such was the fire of a most promising son who if he had been bred to his father's profession would have outstripped any empiric of any age or countrynever was youth so well calculated by nature for this important science Nobody was better qualified for the happy practice of every trick and deceit requisite for succeeding in this ingenious profession No body could have distributed the pill or nostrum with a better grace or more selfsufficiency Nobody could have better amused the multitude with founding sentences equally  devoid of sense or argument But there is a peculiarity of fate attends every man so that instead of being brought up to the external stage it so fell out that young  Pam  for so his name was familiarly contracted was bound apprentice to a grocerBut this crafty youth aspiring to greater things and feeling in himself the seeds of a towering treachery and chicane soon broke his apprenticeship and  John Bull  for his father's sake for he had cured him of a bad rupture gave the lad a very snug birth in his  comptinghouse  where he was put under the immediate and instructive tuition of one  Harry MacBumbo  and he together with his preceptor had been aiding and abetting in framing the late infamous compromise respecting the long litigated affair of the  west country  tenantry  Young  Pam  of whom we shall have occasion to speak more at large hereafter was a youth of pregnant parts and as I have before observed had excellent talents for haranguing the multitude Though I am apt to think they were much overrated and that his own view of them was through a large magnifying medium Add to this he enjoyed a very handsome portion of superciliousness great arrogance great obstinacy great pomposity of expression  together with great craft cunning duplicity and meanness of mindTo these were joined a preposterous ambition not for power but for the mere shadow and semblance of it To gratify this strange equivocal passion he would have sacrificed every consideration human or divineTo enjoy this phantom there was no degree of meanness he would not submit to Nor did he feel sore at the necessity of flattering fawning and crouching to those who were in possession of the real object of his desires  Such was the person fixed upon by the  nurse  for the management of her proposed enterprize when time should have properly matured matters for action for which she waited with a fever of impatience Nor was the youth and inexperience of  Pam  any serious objection in her eyes for what she required was implicit obedience without either reflection or knowledge  She also communicated her secret intentions to some other chosen associates among whom was one  Surly  a leading conspirator to whom it is said  Pam  owed his present promotion having been recommended by him as the most proper tool for such a transaction  Surly  was by nature formed for a conspirator of a stern and capricious turn of mind he was as  Shakespear  phrases it fit for treason stratagem and spoil and took upon himself the great direction of this disgraceful business  Things were now beginning to ripen and the  nurse  and  Surly  had settled their plan The  nurse  therefore sent for  Pam  informing him of what great things she would do for him if he would undertake this business The boy's head was perfectly turned with this unexpected piece of good fortune by which he saw plainly that he should have the appearance of enjoying great power and preeminence in the familyaccordingly he did not require a moment to consider of what was prudent and proper for him to do or what he really was able forall that was perfectly out of the question and his usual presumption determined him at once to embrace this tempting offer of the  nurse  She finding she had hit upon the fittest tool in the world for her purpose advised him to go without loss of time to Mrs  Bull  's apartment and call upon her to exert herself in concerting and carrying through a compleat reform and regulation of those clerks who had taken upon  themselves the transactions of the  East country  trade  Pam  went accordingly and executed his commission with a good grace He told Mrs  Bull  that such a licentious conduct in a set of clerks ill became that character for humanity and that reputation for regularity which Mr  Bull  had acquired in the trading world that it was a great disgrace upon him and upon the whole family and that for his part he wished of all things to see a proper reform set on foot Not a trivial enquiry a palliative or half measure but a strong manly and decided determination to stem that torrent of villainy and abuse of power which were become shameful not only in the eyes of Mr  Bull  and his family but also in those of all the neighbours  Renard  happened to be in Mrs  Bull  's chamber when  Pam  held this discourse and said candidly openly and ingeniously that he was truly ashamed he had never yet stirred in a business which he felt so essentially necessary to the reputation and prosperity of Mr  Bull  and the house and as one of his confidential secretaries he reckoned it his duty to prepare and lay a plan before Mrs  Bull  for her opinion and approbation  Accordingly comes Mr  Renard  in a few days with his plan and a very sensible and well digested one it was and extremely well calculated for the purpose  Pam  was present when  Renard  read it over to Mrs  Bull  and was chuckling and perfectly happy to think he had now got  Renard  to propose an affair which he was fully convinced would ruin him for ever Mrs  Bull  he knew had a little penchant towards the present establishment and he was in the highest hopes that she would reject the plan proposed by  Renard  which plan he thought would throw him into perfect disgrace with  John Bull  his family and countinghouseBesides  Pam  well knew that many of Mrs  Bull  's servants were clearly in the interest of the  east country  clerks from motives of selfinterest and from douceurs which they had either touched or were in hopes of touching Nay it was even shrewdly suspected in the family that the  nurse  herself and some of her nearest connections had at times felt something of an itching palm and that she had no greater aversion than her neigbours to the lustre of oriental gewgaws of which little frailties female minds are wonderfully susceptible How far this may have been the case at present I  will not take upon me to determine but if it was so it must be allowed that upon this as well as on other occasions she perfectly understood how to dissemble for she not only agreed to the necessity of a reform but even approved of the proposed plan as effectual  Pam  was however egregiously mistaken with respect to Mrs  Bull  who saw with her usual good sense that trifling regulations would not do the business and that it required such vigorous measures as  Pam  himself had proposed and  Renard  had planned  Never was poor wretch so humbled and so crest fallen as was Mr  Pam  when he heard Mrs  Bull  's sentiments upon this subject He left the apartment quite in despair having no consolation remaining but in the support and obstinacy of the  nurse  Just as he was going through the lobby with a heavy heart fortunately for him he met with one  Trim Stutter  a near relation of his own to whom he briefly related what had passed  Trim  who was a man of intrigue bid  Pam  be of good cheer for so long as he had the patronage and protection of the  nurse  he said he had nothing to fear I will go to her this very night says  Trim  there is a private back way I have of getting at her apartment and I will then propose a scheme by which I think  Renard  's plan may yet be defeated and he and his friends be laid on their backs  CHAP V  How Trim Stutter mounts the back stairs and gets into the Nurse's private apartments The curious conversation which there ensued A conversation well worth the strictest attention of statesmen and others  TRIM  was as good as his wordAs soon as it was dark away he goes to the back door which leads to a pair of back stairs that go up to the  nurse  's apartment groping his way as well as he could at last with the help of a dark lanthorn he finds out the place and being very thin and lank he squeezes himself up the narrow winders with great stillness and alacrity Having now reached the  nurse  's apartment he made an apology for disturbing her at that unseasonable time of night and signified that nothing but the importance of the business could have made him take the liberty of approaching her person but that being extremely  attached to her he could do no less than represent the danger which threatned her  "What What"  said the  nurse  as her manner was when she wished to have any thing repeated Perhaps on this occasion she might have perfectly understood her informer but she was happy to hear the repetition of a subject so agreeable  What madam said  Trim  can your ladyship for  Trim  was a very courtly person and understood flattery well be ignorant that should this plan of  Renard  's take place for the reform of the  East country clerks  your power in this family will be annihilated for ever  Nurse  What what  Trim  Don't you plainly perceive madam that this plan puts it out of your ladyship's power ever to name any of the servants for the management of the  East country  business The whole is put into the hands of a few of  Renard  's particular friends and they will have so much in their power and so many good things to give away that it must establish on the surest footing both  Renard  's and  Boreas  's influence in the comptinghouse and in the family insomuch that nobody will ever pay court to your ladyship  again and you must remain a cypher for ever after  Nurse  Very just Mr  Stutter  very just indeed but how can I prevent this evil what is to be done  Trim  Nothing so easy madam go to Mrs  Bull  and let her know that in such a case you can by a long established right which you enjoy absolutely stop the further progress of this abominable plan  Nurse  That is true Mr  Stutter  I know I can but I do not like it You know I have already approved of it and therefore to fly directly in its face would not have a very good look for a person of my family and characterNo that won't do but if you can suggest any indirect means of stifling this plan I am very well inclined to adopt that method  Trim  Perfectly right an't please your ladyship But there is still another way which is indirect and consequently better suited to your disposition What I would propose is that your ladyship should give me a few lines to Mrs  Bull's  servants in her upper apartment where  Renard  's plan now lies and I know that with your authority and a few shiners properly  applied together with promises of some of those pretty coloured ribbons white sticks and other toys which you used to make presents of I shall get her servants to break their words betray their trusts and throw all the papers out of the window and make them give out that they have been lost or mislaid God knows how  Nurse  I thank you my good cousin  Stutter  this is an excellent idea of yoursBut what is next to be done for this fellow  Renard  is indefatigable You may depend upon it he will have another plan of the same kind prepared and laid before Mrs  Bull  who in the humour she is now in will again approve of it and recommend it to  John  Trim  Certainly madam all this will be done if your ladyship permits it but Lord how easy is it with your power and influence to prevent any such thing  Nurse  How how Mr  Stutter  I am all impatience  Trim  How why set  Whigman Boreas  and  Renard  and all their adherents a packing without any ceremony  Nurse  Yes that I would do with all my heart Mr  Stutter  but what would  John  and what would his  Wife  say to it  Trim  As to  Bull  madam you well know what a clodpated numsculled beastly fellow it is Surely you have not lived so long in this family without learning how easily he may be hoodwinked and convinced that black is white  Nurse  For God'ssake explain yourself for I will do any thing from hatred and revenge  Trim  Ay madam these are indeed princely passions and ought to be indulgedWas I in your ladyship's place I would never forgive those two infamous scoundrels  Boreas  and  Renard  for basely forgetting past injuries and daring to coalesce for the good of  Bull  's affairs This shows more than any thing what damned milky blooded villains they are I beg pardon for swearing in your ladyship's presence but I always grow warm on this subject  Nurse  But good Mr  Stutter  I pray you point out my path to vengeance and let me know how I must manage that beastly monster  Bull    Trim  The easiest thing in the world madam I shall have a set of profligate hirelings taken into pay in order to spread a parcel of the most confounded lies that ever were invented I'll have rumours carried into every coffeehouse tavern and alehouse that  Bull  frequents For instance I'll have it given out that  Renard  had formed a plot against your long established authority in this family and that he  Whigman  and  Boreas  had conspired to annihilate your power That in order to do this more effectually they were going to have assumed to themselves all the power and possessions of the  East country clerks  and that they were going by their new plan under pretence of reformation to have seized and confiscated all their property to have stolen the written agreement formerly made signed sealed and delivered and that this was only a prelude to their making away with every other agreement deed and charter in the possession of  John Bull  by which he holds his lands liberties and franchises I shall also have it given out that this same  Renard  was absolutely caught picking the lock of  Bull  's strongroom where the titledeeds were lodged and even the greatest of all deeds by  old Glorious  stiled  Magna Farta  and that if it had  not been for your ladyship's watchful eye and maternal care of  John  's concerns there is little doubt but the villain would have made away with the whole and got clear off  Nurse  This is a most admirable stratagem sweet Mr  Trim  there is no end to your wonderful fertility in expedients I have no doubt but this will go down and succeed with  Bull  for he is most comfortably stupid  Trim  Go down madam I'll pledge myself it shall go down for if he should not believe it at first as to be sure it is somewhat incredible yet I will have a set of fellows hireed ycleped garreteers and scriblers who shall force it down his throat so that he shall either swallow or choak upon it  Nurse  Ha ha ha My dear cousin  Stutter  though I am very poorly with a bilious complaint yet I must laugh at your way of expressing yourself there is no resisting your sterling humour I now see my way distinctly I shall get compleat revenge of those worthless scoundrels who wanted to govern this family by means of Mrs  Bull  forsooth as if her word was to be a  law  No truly this family and all mankind shall see that Mrs  Herenhausen  is somebody  Trim  Somebody madam Why if you know yourself you are every body and every thing and should and shall absolutely command this family from head to foot  Nurse  My dear cousin you shall know all the feelings of my soul I will not attempt to conceal any of them from you Love of sway desire of revenge and a little squeeze of malice here and there by way of relish are what I like with all my heart and therefore to indulge these at present I would give up any consideration whatever I would even sacrifice  Bull  and his affairs and allow them to go to the devil I could be reconciled to my most detested enemies so they could be aiding to my present purpose On such an irresistible occasion I could embrace with cordiality the once loathsome  Jack Squintum  the blasphemer of his God the libeller of his King and the traducer of my mother's fair fame  Trim  Very noble very generous indeed madam every word every feeling shews what a great soul you are possessed of    Nurse  But Mr  Stutter  allow me to say there is still one great desect in our plan for though we may and I trust we have contrived to blindfold  Bull  compleatly yet we have a much more difficult task to reconcile his wife to our plan for she no doubt is a sensible woman and is most sincerely attached from good opinion both to  Boreas  and  Renard  and consequently may take their dismission extremely ill out In this case perhaps she may dispute the point with me and if she gets  John  to side with her he may play up old gooseberry with us for you well know what a furious ungovernable animal it is  Trim  I perfectly foresee this difficulty and do think with your ladyship that it is not impossible but Mrs  Bull  may opiniatre the matter a littleand no doubt this requires management But Mrs  Bull  is not inflexible she may be coaxedWe must keep well with her servantsVeils Madam veils will do a great dealand then as I before observed your ladyship has so many pretty things to giveHonours and prefermentsand increase of wages and to the maidservants ribbons stars and garters and such like toys with these you may depend upon it we shall bring Mrs  Bull  over to our interest  Nurse  I have great confidence in your opinion Mr  Stutter  But if I should be disappointed what is next to be done  Trim  Why then Madam there is but one way  Nurse  What is it Mr  Stutter what is it  Trim  To poison or to stab her at once  Nurse  Alas Mr  Stutter  that I would do with all my heart but what would the coroner's inquest say to it  Trim  Pooh pooh Madam leave that to me I will settle that matter without much trouble In the first place when the murder is done I will lay down the bloody weapon by her side and shall hire some physicians and ruffians the former of whom will swear that Mrs  Bull  was perfectly out of her mind and fit only for Bedlam The latter will swear that they saw her put an untimely end to her own existence  Nurse  You quite transport me Mr  Stutter  I long to be in at the death But what will  Bull  say to all thisperhaps he will ride restive and have the matter fully investigated  Trim  BULL MadamLord how little your ladyship is acquainted with the character of  Bull  I will engage to convince him that his wife was not faithful to his bed that to my certain knowledge she had been too familiar with and too fond of both  Boreas  and  Renard  that she had a strong propensity to your portly corpulent men like  John  himself and that she was often heard to confess that there was no resisting the persuasive eloquence of either of her two favorites  Bull  who is naturally abundantly credulous will give ear to all this and I shall confirm his suspicions by a thousand circumstancesSo that I doubt not but he will soon damn her to  Hell  for an abominable strumpet and think himself extremely lucky in having got rid of her  Nurse  That is a very happy idea besides I have bethought myself of a way to conciliate  John  's affections and good wishes and to rouse his apprehensions For you know cousin though I have the most sovereign contempt for this great blustering Oaf yet I have always pretended vast regard and affection for him and great zeal for his welfare Now I doubt not but he is compleatly gulled by my professions and as he is a good natured beast I have great reason to think that he has a tenderness  and goodwill towards me Taking advantage of these I'll give it out that being totally disgusted with the insolent behaviour and contumely of Mrs  Bull  that I have come to the determination to quit his family for good and never more to set foot within his door I'll go further for I ll have a boat ordered to come to  Bullock's Hatch Stairs  as if I was ready to set off God knows I have no such intention but I know this will move  John  and many of his old servants will take the alarm and begin seriously to regret my departure fearing that matters may go worse without me  Their compassion and their fears once up we may then venture to do with Mrs  Bull  what we please and I am convinced we may then get all inquest concerning her madness and death properly made up  Trim  A most admirable plan indeed Madam your ladyship has hit this off wonderfully well you ladies have more invention at these little strokes of intrigue than we men have But now we are upon these subjects will you permit me to ask your ladyship if you have any other cause of resentment to the present set of servants beside the attempt they have now made to deprive you of your usual influence  Nurse  Yes surely Mr  Stutter  I have many good reasons for the rooted aversion I bear them Did they not come in in a manner selfappointed through the influence of Mrs  Bull  Do you think a woman of my dignity ought to bear that interference with my authority But this is not allWere they not men of abilities in whom  John  and his whole family placed great confidence and were they not determined to do what was right and useful without implicitly obeying my commands Could any mortal in my situation bear this  Trim  Abominable indeed MadamBut  Boreas  was surely accustomed to obey you and would doubtless have continued to have done so  Nurse  You are quite mistaken cousin He had already declared he had seen his error respecting the conduct of the  West Country Lawsuit  and had determined to act as he judged most expedient for the advantage of  John  's affairs You cannot imagine how much I tried him upon this subject I next tried to sow dissention between him and  Renard  but the fellow pretended strict honour and would not break his promise Curse on his honour I think he  should have laid that aside where I was concerned But I will now be even with him and his colleagueThey may plume themselves now if they please upon their strict honour  Trim  To be sure it was perfectly ridiculous in them to think of honourBut all the world must allow them abilities  Nurse  Confound their abilities it is for these I hate them I hate abilities wherever I find them They always make men proud and independent the things in the world I most detest in those who fill subordinate stations  Trim  Well Madam I can venture to assure you that my cousin  Pam  with all his abilities has not the least idea of dignity or independence I shall be quite deceived if your ladyship does not find him to have a very mean submissive and pliant mind quite suited to your purposes He certainly has ambition but then it is altogether of that grovelling kind which does not court power but merely the semblance of it with leave to boast of it and for that supreme indulgence I promise you he will do every thing you wish He will cringe to old  Surly  and even tho' that's extremely low I  will venture to say he will stoop to take any orders from your waiting maid Mrs  Jenky  Nurse  Upon my word cousin  Stutter  you give me a very high character of Mr  Pam  which I do assure you impresses me with the most favourable opinion of the young man But it is now full time I should give you the messages to Mrs  Bull  's servants  CHAP VI  Extraordinary consequences of an extraordinary conversationPam's plan is burnt by Mrs BullTrim recommends murderMrs Bull is saved by the preposterous vanity of Pam  THUS ended this very extraordinary conversation to the mutual satisfaction of both parties  Trim  took leave in order to go and deliver his messages to Mrs  Bull  's servants and at the same time gave them to understand what they were to expect for the service required of them Some of them however fought shy upon the subject and said they had promised  Renard  to take particular care of his papersOthers who were sincerely attached to  Boreas  and  Renard  said no harm should come to the papers if they could possibly prevent it But far the greatest part of them being naturally of the most  accommodating  turn of  mind  took  Trim  aside and told him not to give himself any further trouble for tho' they had promised  Renard  to take care of his plan yet they had such respect for the  nurse  's opinion in all these mattersthat he might rest assured the plan should never more be seen in that apartment  Trim  was now perfectly overjoyed He returned the following nightby the same dark path to the nurse's apartment carrying along with him his cousin  Pam  who was now made steward in the room of Mr  Whigman  and  Trim Stutter  for his good services was made one of  John  's secretaries along with one  Tim Simper  a poor cuckoldy kind of a fellow who knew nothing whatever of business but was placed there very malapropos to  fill a gap  It might now be very properly said that the  Nurse  was as happy as a  king  She therefore no longer kept any terms with  Whigman  or  Boreas  or  Renard  but was determined to send them all apacking together  Being however ashamed of this dirty and deceitful business she would not face the principal but sent a message by  Trim  desiring to have the keys of the  house compting house cellars pantry  and larder c delivered up to her which was immediately complied with by the parties  Upon hearing of this extraordinary proceeding  Boreas  and  Renard  went immediately to Mrs  Bull  to enquire the cause of it She declared she knew nothing of the matter and was as much surprised as they themselves had been  Renard  complained to her loudly of this sort of treatment and said It was singular that people going about their business with all the attention imaginable and doing every piece of drudgery should be undermined by  secret influence  and  backstair visits  and turned out of doors without a month's warning or a month's wages and all this without any reason assigned  Pam  now came by order of the  Nurse  to pay his respects to Mrs  Bull  and to inform her of his promotion He was prodigiously elevated on the occasion and was become very high and mighty and extremely pompousHe told Mrs  Bull  that the reason of the dismission of  John  's late servants was their attempt to carry thro'  the  East coutury  business in so absurd a manner as to ruin the whole of the  poor clerks  who had been engaged in that trade by confiscating their property and seizing their goods and warehouses and depriving them not only of their chartered rights but also of their possessionsBut that this was not all for that  John Bull  himself was extremely alarmed considering this only as a prelude to deprive him of all his rights and franchises whatsoeverand also taking from the  Nurse  the power and patronage which was her due and which she had so long enjoyed in the family with the universal approbation of all good men  Renard  who set by and heard all this harangue was perfectly astonished at such amazing effrontery and misrepresentation from so young a dogand opening upon him with his usual ability and eloquence he so belaboured and bespattered and bedeviled him that Mrs  Bull  cried shame upon him for a worthless young cur she would have nothing to do with himBut  Pam  who was presumption and arrogance personifiedtold Mrs  Bull  that he would prepare a plan for regulating the clerks and trade of the  East country  infinitely superior to that of  Renard  for it was to have all the effect without any of the faultsAccordingly  he brought his plan to Mrs  Bull  and having read it to her both  Boreas  and  Renard  disapproved so much of it that Mrs  Bull  ordered it to be thrown into the fireThis however did not dismay our striplingwho was now in the secret and knew he had only to brazen it out till Mrs  Bull  was dispatchedMrs  Bull  herself knowing the  Nurse's  character and her extreme vindictive disposition felt some forebodings of her fate and used to communicate her suspicions to  Renard  and  Boreas  and her other friendsNay she even charged  Pam  to his face with having some evil intentions towards herBut like master like man they say for  Pam  was now become a compleat master of dissimulation and swore himself black in the face that there was not the least intention to touch a hair of her head  Trim  however insisted both with the  Nurse  and with  Pam  that now or never was the time for dispatching the good old lady who he insisted would thwart them in all their views and he declared his fingers were itching for her blood But  Pam  who was young and not yet innured to murder and assassination begged of them to spare her life and having a very high opinion of his own eloquence he said he would try what that could do to bring her over to his  way of thinking And truly it must be confessed that for an innocent and immaculate young creature yet  unhacknied  in the ways of men nobody could set about this business with a better address or with more forcible or persuasive arguments But having now all the affairs of his stewardship upon his hands it could not be supposed he could manage every thing by himself and therefore he found it necessary to employ agents to transact all those matters of bribery and corruption which he found it absolutely necessary for him to carry on in order to gain over Mrs  Bull  's servants And it must be allowed he made a very good choice of men who were every way qualified for that purpose  CHAP VII  Pam's liberal and ingenious plan of bribery and corruptionCharacter of his principle Agents  IT is highly necessary for the better understanding this my authentic history that I should here give a true and faithful character of those two singular agents who were appointed by young  Pam  to the management of all that liberal and generous branch of business  which is vulgarly denominated bribery and corruption This  Pam  determined with his usual noble way of thinking to carry on upon a far more extensive and solid plan than had ever before been attempted even in the golden times of old  Robin  The first of his runners in rank and in talents was his former master  Harry MacBumbo  Alias starvation  Harry  alias  Harry Hurlythrumbo  alias East country  Harry  alias North country  Harry  for he was a cunning rogue and like other desperados had taken various names the better to disguise himself and prevent detection He had been heretofore in the service of  John Bull  's own sister  Peg  where he had had the run of her kitchen but finding that fare vastly too scanty for his eager appetite and seeing nothing but starvation staring him in the face he was determined to shift his ground and look out for somewhat more lucrative He hastened therefore to a scene of action much more suitable to his talents and entered into the service of  John Bull  and was by means of his wife placed under the direction of  Boreas  during his stewardship  MacBumbo  who was a sly bustling fellow soon recommended himself to  Boreas  by assiduity activity and zeal and was  by him liberally rewarded for his trouble insomuch that  Harry  vowed attachment to his benefactor for life an oath he always readily made on such occasions  When  Malagrida  suceeded to the stewardship he paid his court very successfully to him who finding him useful and ready at all sorts of work and that if well paid he would turn his hand to any thing be it ever so dirty he continued him in the countinghouse and gave him a very snug birth For which as before he swore an attachment for life to  Malagrida  When  Malagrida  was dismissed by Mrs  Bull  for his abominable compromise as we have before related  MacBumbo  did not think he was likely to be taken much notice of in future either by  Boreas  or  Renard  seeing that they knew him and knew exactly by what steerage he shaped his course He therefore pitched upon young  Pam  for his future patron to whom he once more sold himself for life soul and body as thinking  Pam  stood well with the  Nurse  and trusting that this was far the surest and nearest road to present pay and good quarters  MacBumbo  was a rare talkative fellow in his northern jargon and discoursed with great apparent manliness openness and  boldness which was altogether to be attributed to manner for at bottom he was false and hollow He certainly had considerable talents but they were accompanied with grat rashness imprudence and precipitation He was prodigal in his expences and dissolute in his way of life so that he was always in debt and in difficultiesbut as he could not live without his pleasures he was glad to procure them at any price Money therefore he must have and it was his established maxim  "No pay no swiss"  It was no wonder then if  MacBumbo  always devoted himself to the best bidder  Pam  tho' yet  unbacknied in the ways of men  plainly perceived that  MacBumbo  was likely to be damned useful where much dirty work was to be done  Nor was  Pam  less successful in his choice of a second agent A man whom history sensible of her own dignity stoops with incredible reluctance to describe The meanness of his mind could only be equalled by the lowness of his birth His progenitor was a melter of tallow He was reared in the service of a  famous shipbuilder  and never in any transaction in his life lost sight of a job He was recommended to  Boreas  by his former master but his gratitude to him for that service never sat  heavy on his stomach He improved his opportunities under  Boreas  to great advantage For he being steward in the time of the lawsuit when great sums were annually expended there was much money to be borrowedgreat fees to be paid to counselgreat bills to attorneys open table was kept for them and this occasioned a vast expence in cooks scullions firing and God knows what allNothing of this immense detail escaped the jobbing vigilance of  Jack  the  Ratcatcher  for that was his name and designation He used to sweat every guinea that passed through his hands and much good bread and butter cheese and beer did he make away with Besides it was shrewdly suspected that he run  snips  with all the butchers bakers brewers brokers and contractors of the times till he acquired a fortune more than  Ministerial  Renard  when in office wanted very much to have enquired into the state of this man's illgotten gains but  Boreas  from friendship interfered and prevented it As to  Jack  himself he rose up before Mrs  Bull  and her whole company and swore upon the holy Evangelists that he had only pocketed a very small sum which he said he had scraped together by great penury  and attention And this he did with what the Irish call a very pretty presence of mind at the same time that almost every body present knew he was living in the greatest splendor and profusion Whether Mrs  Bull  really gave much credit to his assertions I never could learn but this I know that few besides believed him However he was ably defended by  Boreas  for whose veracity and disinterestedness Mrs  Bull  had the highest respect But  Jack  like a compleat scoundrel lived to turn tail on his Maker and betray his liberal benefactor He had however found means to ingratiate himself much with the nurse and had received from her some marks of her favour  CHAP VIII  Mrs Bull proves refractory notwithstanding all the artifices of MacBumbo and Jack the RatcatcherAn altercation takes place between her and the NurseA meeting of mutual friends is held at the Old Wrestlerswhich breaks up  re infecta  Alarm of Mrs BullIs comforted by Boreas and RenardJohn reasons on the state of affairsThe boat trick is tried without effect  SUCH were the runners now in the service of  Pam  and he employed them according  to their genius and talents Finding Mrs  Bull  strongly bent against his appointment to the Stewardship as considering him a mere  Schoolboy  inexperienced in business bookkeeping and accounts and without knowledge of mankind he was however determined if possible to win her over to his side and so set  Mac Bumbo  and  Jack  to work to corrupt all her servants by foul or by fair means Some they bribed others they intimidated and to some they promised little annuities for life or posts or ribbons or stars or white wands and such like baubles which were all to be furnished by the  Nurse  who had a neat assortment of this kind of Gewgaws This to manly minds may appear a species of corruption that could but little avail but it should be remembered that they were not ill adapted to the maidservants and other low cattle about Mrs  Bull  's family  However all this could not move Mrs  Bull  who continued inflexible in spite of every argument that could be used with her servants or that her servants could use with her  At last it came to very severe heartburnings between her and the  Nurse  who complained grievously that Mrs  Bull  was of a most incroaching disposition for it has been her province  time out of mind to appoint  John  's domesticks and that now Mrs  Bull  wanted most unwarrantably to arrogate the whole power to herself Besides says she what fault can she find with the young man I have appointed has she any crime to lay to his charge if she has let her name it  On the other hand Mrs  Bull  protested that she did not wish to encroach on the  Nurse  s province of appointing the servants on the contrary it would be to her a very troublesome and a very invidious task but at the same time she was obliged to keep the purse and to lay out  John  's cash to the best advantage and with the greatest management and oeconomy she therefore thought it would be very hard indeed if she had not at least a negative voice and a power of representing her opinion about new servants and of saying such a person will never do I cannot trust himwhich is says she all I alledge with respect to  Pam  who tho' I do not charge with any crime yet I must and do insist upon it that I cannot put confidence in himin short he is too young and inexperienced he is a mere schoolboy who can know nothing of men or of affairsNow tho' I cannot trust to this boy surely I do not mean to name any body in his place let the  Nurse  choose whom she pleases and if I think he is really qualified for the management of  John  's affairs I am sure I shall raise no objection whatever But where there is many to choose from I confess I should be very sorry to see a very bad choice made  Such was the stile in which both parties talked of each other and as it always happens on such occasions the more they talked the more they became irritated at length Mrs  Bull  was advised by her friends to write a civil letter to the  Nurse  to explain her sentiments at large This she did in a very polite manner but the  Nurse  as her temper dictated was as obstinate as a mule and would not yield a jot She however thought it requisite to give a civil answer to Mrs  Bull  's letter which she did in the most shufling and deceitful languageSome mutual friends then interposed and by various meetings at the Old Wrestlers tried to accommodate matters between the parties but this also failed of success for they could get nothing out of the  Nurse  but equivocal propositions couched in the most obscure terms  It was then the good old lady Mrs  Bull  began seriously to apprehend danger to herself and communicated her ideas thereon to  Boreas  and  Renard  who both assured her she had nothing to fear at present because both the  Nurse  and  Pam  knew that her life was of the greatest importance to her husband and to the existence of the whole familyFor she must surely know that she had in her possession a sum of money which could not be touched or disposed of without her consent and approbation which sum was absolutely necessary to save  John  from immediate bankruptcy  Besides said they you have another hold over the  Nurse  and  Pam  which is the arrears due to the counsel and lawyers and the settlement of their business which it is well known they require annually which with their other pressing demands cannot be finally adjusted without your consent and approbation and who in case of any delay or want of punctuality in their payment and such like would bring both the  Nurse  and  John  himself over the coals in the twinkling of an eyeYou may therefore depend upon it nothing can be attempted against your life while you wield these weapons in your own hand  All this while  John  who had heard of this miff and who had not at first concerned himself much about it thinking it only a foolish squabble  between two old women began now to look upon it as a more serious matter than he was aware of and felt rather uneasy about it To be sure quoth  John  Mrs  Bull  is my lawful wife and as such is my representative in this family and is entitled to the respect and attention of the best of them But at the same time I would not have the  Nurse  maltreated or degraded neither She's an old friend and I must not see her wronged but I know she's damned obstinate when she takes any freak in her head O as for that one might as well try to move the great  Germanic  empireBut continued he I don't like this huge familiarity between my wife and  Boreas  and still worse her late gossipings with this same squire  Renard  Hang it I am not naturally jealous neither but yet there is a wonderful sort of a flirtation goes on in that quarterpoh poh it cannot be my wife is too old and too sedate to think of these pranks in her old daysBut damn it who knows she may still have a colt's tooth in her head I did get such a hint from one of my best friends and one who I am sure wishes me well  Just as  John  was running over a variety of circumstances pro and con in his own mind  and trying which way the balance inclined the scale of suspicion seeming rather to proponderateHis lucubrations were all at once interrupted by a flying report that there was a boat gone up to the stairs at  Bullock'shatch  in order to take the  Nurse  and all her luggage aboard that she might go home to her own native country  John's  uneasiness and apprehensions were rather increased upon this however he plucked up a spirit and observed That if she was tired of him and his family she might go he would keep the boy  George  who he was very sure would be glad to stay with him This being faithfully reported to the  Nurse  nettled the old woman not a littleAnd tho' she laid aside all thoughts of carrying the boat trick any farther lest it should be carried too faryet there were other stratagems in store and more artillery to be played off  CHAP IX  Jemmy MacOssian is put at the head of a gang of ThievesHe propogates falshoods as gross and palpable as the father that begat themSome curious anecdotes of his life character and conversationMrs Rumour informs John of his Wife's death  THE next trick to be tried was to have a gang of lying prating thieves who were to disperse themselves in the coffeehouses taverns and alehouses and wherever  John  was to be seen and there to drum it eternally in his ears as how  Renard  had been seen with Mrs  Bull  at all hours of the night and as how he had been overheard proposing to her to break open the strong room and make off with  John's  titledeeds and as how she being too great with  Renard  did not seem to objectand also as how they had sometimes with them a long robeman who encouraged them in this plan by telling them  That titledeeds and even Magna Farta itsels were nothing to signify for that they were only pieces of parchment with seals dangling to the ends of them  All this curious fabrication of falshood misrepresentation and  mischief was put under the direction of one  Jemmy Mac Ossian  a very cunning crafty loon as ever sister  Peg  bred in her garret His father had been catched tried and hanged for malpractices and maroding on the outskirts of  John's  landsYoung  Hopeful  had been brought up a scholar and taught his bare bottomed compatriots greek and latin at s Scotch per Quarter Being however a stout lad and pushing his fortune he made his way into  John's  kitchen where he fattened on  sippets  soaked in the dripping pan which he got from the maids for writing songs and talking baudy with them At last he felt a  strong itch  to translate his native  bare broad Erse  into a good  English dress  he came now to carry his head a little higher and got acquainted with some of the clerks of the countinghouse particularly  Jack  the  Ratcatcher  who employed him to write briefs for the counsel in the  West country  lawsuit At length being always awake to his own interest he got himself foisted into an  East country  agency by which means he acquired great wealth and was one of those who dreaded nothing so much as the regulation of those affairs by which an end might be put to pilfering peculation and perfidyIn all of which he was too deeply interested  and too succefsfully engagedThis was the Captain of that band of infamous storytellers who were now employed by  Trim  and  Pam  to spread the alarm to  John  and so industrious were they and so often did they repeat their fabrications that a person less credulous than  John  would have given some credit to them But it was not  John's  character to be duped by halves when he was gulled he was most compleatly so and on this occasion  MacOssian  and his gang were much an overmatch for him Upon hearing the same thing repeated over and over again in every placewithout considering the probability of what was so boldly and so roundly asserted  John  exclaimed By God what every body says must be true I did suspect says he that there was some damned villiany going on and now the matter is come out as clear as day Well I do say it is impossible to know womankind I thought I could have trusted my wife with my honour with my puise with every thing dear to me and here I find that she and  Renard  were laying their plan to cuckold me in my own house and then to run off with my titledeedsAh  John Bull John Bull  you have made a narrow escape Lord Lord how deceitful is womanNobody looks half so composed or so decent  so meek or so motherly as my wifeand yet at her time of life to go astray well well this shews what opportunity and importunity will do with womankind  Just as  John  had pronounced this wise observationHe was accosted by old  Mother Rumour  who kept the Coffeehouse and who civilly asked him if his Worship had heard that Mrs  Bull  was deadDead says  John  what my wifeMrs  Bull  dead Yes replied Mrs  Rumour  an't please your Worship your wife Mrs  Bull  is certainly as dead as  Harry  the VIIIth Why you astonish me says  John  she was in perfect health last night what did she die of Nay sir as for the matter of that said Mrs  Rumour  to be sure there are various and sundry reports concerning this affair some say she died of a  poplectic fit  some say that the poor woman was beside herself and that she  permitted a fellow of the sea  upon her own bodyOdds bodikins quoth  John  I am afraid it was a  fellow of the land  that she  permitted  on her own bodyBe that as it may I must go and enquire into this very singular and critical event  FIFTH PART  CHAPTER I  A true narrative of  Mrs Bull  's tragical exit with the unhappy fate of her favourite sisterSome remarks on her daughter and a sketch of her willA curious account of the Coroner his inquest and verdict  JOHN BULL  was not in that humour at present to be much grieved at the death of his wife who as we have above related he began to harbour a very so so opinion of He therefore gave himself but little trouble to find out the cause of her sudden departure and of her sister's misfortune a catastrophe which did not seem to affect him more than it does the common run of fashionable husbands  This however is an event of which we as an authentic historian of the  res gestae  of those times cannot omit giving a most circumstantial account as faithfully and as correctly as it  been wanted to us on the great tide of contemporary writers  The  Nurse Trim  and  Pam  were now convinced from experience that Mrs  Bull  was far too honest too disinterested and too faithful to her husband to allow herself to be detached from what she thought his real good They therefore determined without further deliberation to bring her to an untimely end But first it was found absolutely necessary to get her to settle the two points above mentionedFor this purpose they chose to dissemble their hatred and even went so far as to cajole the good woman a piece of deceit and duplicity which cost none of them very dearA young friend of  Pam  's of whom Mrs  Bull  was known to have a good opinion was now charged with a message to her when assurances passed of the  Nurse  's great regard for her and how far it was from her thoughts to have any bad intentions towards her with a thousand such friendly expressions  It is very difficult to say what passes in any body's mind on most occasions But as Mrs  Bull  was a very sensible woman with an uncommon share of penetration we think it more than probable that she was not altogether  blinded by those professionsHowever they certainly made a great impression but what with her made a much greater was the very nice and critical state of  John  's credit which must have suffered an irrecoverable shock if Mrs  Bull  had not given her consent to the payment of those sums of money which now lay at her disposal And further she dreaded extremely the consequences of not satisfying the counsel and other law folks lately employed in her long vexatious suit for she well knew that this sort of people could not be put off but upon the least demur might bring an action of trespass against  John  These considerations with the assurances given by  Pam  and his friends made her at length come to the fatal resolution of parting with her own security and no sooner was that done but measures were instantly concerted between the  Nurse Trim  and  Pam  how and at what time the horrible deed should be perpetrated All this being fixed the  Nurse  sent word that she was coming to wait upon Mrs  Bull  about business of consequence She went accordingly dressed out in great parade and having talked over the business in the usual waythe  Nurse  before she retired whispered to  Surly  who was near her upon which he stepping forward and pulling forth a mortal instrument  at one blow put a period to the existence of the best of wivesThe bloody scene did not end here for there was in the room at the time a younger and favourite sister of Mrs  Bull  'sMiss  Darling Priviledge  who seeing the fatal blow aimed run to embrace and protect her sister To her the murderers imagined  John  was extremely attached and that she would do every thing in her power to prompt him to view this execrable transaction in its true colours and to punish it with severity For this reason it was that the  Nurse  determined to get rid of her also Besides she knew that this young lady had been very instrumental in instigating Mrs  Bull  to resist her wishes She therefore impressed with the deepest resentment and hoping at once to lay these formidable foes prostrate at her feet drew from her breast a Stiletto with which rushing eagerly upon the mild and blooming maid she plunged the dreadful weapon into her lovely bosom She fell upon the body of her expiring sister where swooning away she was thought to be dead by every person presentand such a report was universally propagated however she was afterwards found with some signs of life and being privately conveyed to the country her friends began to entertain hopes that her weakness was occasioned only by  loss of blood and that with skill and care she might yet be recovered from the dreadful effects of that stunning blow which she had received  Thus fell the unfortunate Mrs  Bull  one of the best of women who had bestowed true pains to retrieve her husband's embarrassed affairs and to restore them to their usual flourishing condition to which there is no doubt but she would have greatly contributed had she not thus fallen a Martyr to the vindictive disposition and ruling passion of the  Nurse  Mrs  Bull  left behind her one daughter named  Reformia  who tho' not a beauty was what may properly be called a bouncing girl she had several admirers of whom we shall have occasion to speak more fully hereafter  Mrs  Bull  bequeathed to this young lady all the savings she had made in the regulating and settling of  John  's affairs This patrimony was very differently spoken of some calling it a very ample fortune and others perhaps with more justice alledging that it was a very inconsiderable sum  Mrs  Bull  together with her blessing bequeathed to  John  a case of choice cordials  which she alledged he would have great occasion for when she was no more What the particular virtues of these cordials were we have never been able to learn  The coroner's inquest was now come to sit on the body of the defunct The coroner himself was a person of notorious infamy and therefore extremely fit for the present purposeHis name was  Lungs  he was a  Mountebank  and in his travels thro' foreign countries he had acquired all the effrontery and all the grimace and jesticulation of that pleasant professionFrom professional habit he was extremely addicted to speechifying on all occasionsand as his contortions and writhings were ridiculous in the extremenobody who saw him could refrain from laughter But the derision and the contempt of the croud made no impression upon his brazen countenance or callous mind which was dipt in gaul and steept in depravity to the very brim There was no species of vice he was not capable of so he could but guard himself against the annimadversion of the law If a murderer was wanted  Lungs  was the man to perpetrate such a crime in the most hidden manner and with the most subtile poisons Was a perjured evidence required to bolster up a bad cause  Lungs  was the man who for money would go compleatly through with it and stop at nonothing In short his mind was formed for every thing base and mean and for every thing detestable This wretch had already received his cue from  Pam  to whom he was some how alliedand having packed his inquest and called for evidence properly instructed they brought in their verdict respecting Mrs  Bull  felo de se and taking it for granted her sisteralso was dead they thought it proper to bring that in lunacyImprobable as these facts might appear to every judicious person yet certain it is that  John Bull  either did give faith to them or seemed so to do  CHAP II  The Nurse is taken ill Is cured by a glyster of Pam's prescribingThe severe duty of Mrs Jenky the waiting maidCritical observation of the historian  I Have already observed that the impatience which had seized the  Nurse  to get rid of servants who were not altogether of her own choosing but who had been strongly recommended  by the late Mrs  Bull  and also that extreme disgust and rage which she had felt at the resistence made by Mrs  Bull  to her appointment of  Pam  had so preyed upon her constitution that she was for sometime labouring under the dreadful effects of a lingering and bileous feverThis increasing with the irritation of fresh events had rendered her extremely costive and bound in the belly Nor could she ever be prevailed upon during the servitude of Mr  Whigman  or his friends to take proper medicines for her complaints  The late sudden changes which she had so artfully contrived and so outrageously accomplished had occasioned a revulsion in her whole frame and  Pam  seeing this encouraged the change of habit by a glyster made up after a quack receipt of his father'sThis coming powerfully in aid of the natural revulsion abovementioned failed not to procure her most copious and fetid evacuations which her physician very sagaciously foretold must do her a great deal of service Indeed such was the uncommon abundance of putrid and corrupted matter that flowed from this noxious source that her apartment stunk most infamously in the noses of every one who had any sense of smelling  And to that degree was the stench of corrupted corruptible and contagious faeces over the whole house that it was almost insufferable in Mrs  Bull  's apartments as well as in the  Nurse  's and absolutely pestilential from top to bottom of the back stairs  John  himself could not but be sensible of it but at this time the  Nurse  and the young quack  Pam  stood so very high in his good graces that it passed for little more than a strong and not unpleasant  hautgout  with poor  John  who never was very remarkable for having a good nose or for looking a great way before it and who on this occasion did not foresee the very bad effects and infectious distemper which such a nuisance might one day create in the familyBut to return to the  Nurse  who we left upon her closestoolThe heat of the matter thus evacuated was so great and in such abundance that it caused a wonderful irritation in the orrifice and circumjacent parts So that the physician recommended the proper application of almond oil and other emolients to soften and cool the parts These were administered with great tenderness and admirable address by the waiting maid Mrs  Jenky  who tho' a tall awkward figure stooped to this operation with a vast deal of grace and deterityBut alas all  this would not do the heat and irritation encreasing the parts became extremely tender and delicate and an inflamation ensuing it was thought absolutely necessary that Mrs  Jenky  should lick with her tongue the place affected a task which she undertook and bent her long back to perform with a suppleness and plyability which excited admiration in every beholder It was however alledged that Mrs  Jenky  tho' long accustomed to the dirtiest of work did grudge her labour in conveying away this nauseous commodity which it is said was by her handed privately to young  Pam  who saw it slyly disposed of in a nasty sink belonging to Mrs  Bull  's upper apartment  We hope we shall be excused this short digression from the thread of our history in order to describe the nature of the  Nurse  's complaints which we have been more particular in narrating as trivial circumstances of this nature often serve to illustrate the state of affairs in private families better and more distinctly than  nobler  or more splendid events  CHAP III  John goes to pay the Nurse a visit and congratulates her upon the dismission of his late servantsShe talks to John about the death of Mrs BullPraises his present servantsAdvises him to think of looking out for another WifeAnd proposes a match which she thinks would fit him to a hair  JOHN  now thought that seeing all exterior forms respecting his late Wife were now fully satisfied that he might go and wait on the  Nurse  in her own apartment Accordingly away steps  John  and having tapped gently at the door was bid to walk in  John  made one of his best bows to the  Nurse  and she on her part affected prodigious kindness and cordiallity to  John  and truly it was no wonder for never had mortal so devoted himself and his interest so implicitly and compleatly to the will and inclinations and passions of another as  John Bull  had done on this occasion to those of his  Nurse  John  up and told his  Nurse  as how he was come after his late loss to congratulate the  Nurse  upon the change of his late abominable servants whose roguery and treachery were so well known that it made it very unnecessary for him to say any thing more upon the subject but only to return her his best thanks for the maternal and tender care she had taken of his nearest and dearest concerns  On the other hand the  Nurse  who had a most thorough pace contempt for  Bull  was however extremely happy at this visit because it quite silenced all suspicions and future enquiries and complaintsShe therefore assured him that next to doing what she reckoned her duty nothing gave her half so much pleasure as to find that he approved of her conduct on this occasion which she said was the only means left in her power to save the family the estate and titledeeds which indeed had been in the utmost jeopardy from that lawless vagabond crew which the late Mrs  Bull  had recommended to him Here  John  thought it would be but decent in him to clap his dirty handkerchief to his eyes upon the pretext of wiping away the falling tearBut the  Nurse  let him to know that she thought it very unbecoming in him to lament the loss of any person who could recommend and patronise such servants as his late ones who could use her in so rude  and so brutal a manner by crossing her inclinations in the very thing which of all others she wished mostthe choice of good and useful and honest servants for his family  "You may observe"  continued the  Nurse  "what infinite pains I have taken on this occasion to select for your business the very ablest and best of men I have put young  Pam  at the head of them because of his great  parts and experience in affairs  his  vast knowledge of mankind and the purity of his intentions  Very true madamvery true replied  John  young  Pam  's tender years and  want  of  opportunity  to commit any enormous crimes makes it most natural to imagine that he is very  spotless and unhacknied in the ways of men  and as to his experience in affairs and knowledge of mankind I think I see in this youth a sort of premature abilities that I am persuaded will answer my purpose vastly well much better indeed than all the boasted acquirements of riper yearsBesides he seems to have a deal of steadiness and determinationHe won't easily be put out nor does he seem to want for a very  proper and becomimg confidence  in his own talents  "You are perfectly right said the  Nurse  I am very sure Mr  Bull  that both you and I shall be well satisfied with this young man of whom I have conceived a very high opinion indeedAs to your two secretaries I have equal reason to be well pleased with them I will indeed fairly confess to you that they are not reckoned men of the most shining talents but what of that they are men who will do what they are ordered without hesitation which I take to be the first rate quality in any servant There are some aukward untaught and unmannerly boobies who will stand and consider and pretend to think for themselves what is best to be doneI will venture to say that the present ones are not of that kidney for as they have no ideas of their own they will be very ready to hear any that we shall suggest they will adopt them with eagerness and execute them with pleasure"  "Indeed Madam said  John  every thing you say is a new proof of your wisdom and penetration I was foolish enough formerly to be a little jealous of your power and influence in my family but I protest I now see my own stupidity and in the mind I am now in I think I shall leave the management of all my affairs to you in future and having such an excellent  woman to take a charge of my domestic concerns I am sure I of all men have least reason to regret the loss of my Wife who by the bye I have some reason to believe was no better than she should be  "Better rejoined the  Nurse  she was worse than it is possible for me to painta cross peevish cursed vixenwithout common sense or common civility I am sure she behaved to me in a most insolent indecent and disgraceful manner I can never think of it without the blood boiling in my veins and therefore I must avoid the subject least I should bring on a fresh fit of my late complaint which I seriously believe would have done for me had it not been for the great skill of young  Pam  and the greater care and kind offices of mother  Jenky  good creature"  "Well said  John  Madam let us shift this disagreeable subjectwe have now all before us and thank God you have at length found me a set of honest and upright men who will serve me with honour and conscience"  "Aye said the  Nurse  that I have Mr  Bull  so that you may rest perfectly easy and seeing we are now upon these domestic subjects let me recommend it to you to have an eye to some girl of good family for your future spouse and  not connect yourself and contaminate your blood with a vulgar low bred pitiful draggle tailed dowdy like your last WifeYour character as a tradesman stands very high and though to be sure your affairs are at present somewhat embarrassed yet you are too young to lay aside thoughts of matrimony Besides let me tell you without flattery that mankind have a good opinion of you as an honest industrious good natured fellow who have already made a good husband to a very unworthy match and who of course will make a good husband to a girl of family who might both bring you money and great connexions"  John  could not help smiling at this conversation but brushing up a little at the compliments paid him by the  Nurse  he modestly observed  "That sure no girl of good family and fortune would think of having such an old fashioned clumsy fellow as himself"  "You are mistaken said the  Nurse  good husbands are not so easily come at now a days but for God's sake let me advise you not to think of any future intermarriage with that flaunting tawdry trolloping lowlived family of the  Privileges  I am sure you have had enough  of them to sicken any manNow there is a very fine girl that I have often seen at chapel who I think would suit you prodigiously well a tall genteel majestic elegant looking woman who would do honour to any family a woman of high birth and fashion you will no doubt guess that I point at the charming Miss  Grace Prerogative  "  "Odds bodikins quoth  John  who though no chicken had yet a colt's tooth in his head Miss  Prerogative  is a charming woman sure enoughbut would it not have a very strange appearance to the neighbours for me to make up to a young lady whose family I have always been quarrelling with as a most incroaching and dissatisfied set of people"  "That is the best reason in the world replied the  Nurse  for your making up to the daughter for that will settle all differences and heal old sores"  "By Gingo I believe you are in the right Madam said  John  I have a great mind to give her a call tomorrow morning by way of reconnoitring the premises"  "Indeed said the  Nurse  you are perfectly in the right there is no time to lose for so fine a woman with such genteel connections cannot be long in the market"  "Well by the Lord I'll have a brush at her quoth  John  so good b'ye to ye Madam good b'ye to you"  Away flung  John  and left the  Nurse  as may easily be supposed in a rapture of joy so that she could not help exclaiming  "By the living God I don't believe there is upon earth so good natured or so stupid a mortal as  John Bull  I think I have him snug he is compleatly gulled compleatly duped and compleatly bedeviled"  CHAP IV  John Bull is totally captivated by the charms of the lovely and lofty Miss PrerogativeThe marriage settlementsJohn gives a grand entertainmentThe Nurse is of the partyPam makes the punchJohn gets half seas over is extremely noisy and exposes himself to his guests The Nurse proposes a Foxchase to John who readily agreesand proposes figuring on a drayHorse  JOHN  was not a man who relished any circumbendibus in his mode of acting He always moved straight forward to his point without much manoeuvering an accomplishment which is now found so essential towards the forming great modern sea officers Having been a Buck in his younger days he on this occasion clapped on a very smart suit of cloaths a neat dressed perriwig white silk stockings and a most exorbitant large pair of buckles as was the fashion in those times and away he marched to squire  Prerogative's  It is alledged however that by the way he felt some few compunctions and qualms of conscience as if he had been  acting inconsistently with all the former tenor of his conduct He felt also a little gleam of remorse at connecting himself with a family which had been at constant variance with his former Wife and all her connections and who had at times used them in the most contumelious manner  "Damn me says  John  I wish after all that this is not a rash piece of business I am engaged in I may perchance get into a cursed scrape here and yet she is a fine creature too  this bere Miss Prerogative  a most desirable piece of goods faith with as tight a leg and foot as ever a man laid a long side ofWell e'gad it don't signify I can't see why I should not please myself as well as another a Wife I must have and when I am about it why should not I indulge my present passion I love the girl that is enough"  Urit grata protervitas  Et vultus nimium lubricus aspici  Thus  John  vindicated his passion by a classical quotation for he had been a scholar in his youth and still retained the recollection of a few latin sentences which he sported on proper occasions  We are sorry to observe that contemporary historians have left us totally in the dark as to what passed between  John  and his  Mistress  at  this first interview Perhaps indeed this may have been an effect of their great judgment and decorum and they may have chosen to draw a vail over what it might have been highly improper to discloseFor to say truth we have heard from undoubted authoritythat the young lady in question was as forward a Piece as any in the parish and very likely to allow  John  to take great liberties even at opening the preliminaries  Suffice it therefore to say that  John  was compleatly enamoured and very soon obtained the fair lady's good graces as also the consent of parentsAfter which the settlements were the only remaining obstacle in the way to felicity  John  therefore with the  Nurse  's advice and at her  tance appointed three persons of experienced ability and  distinguished integrity  to superintend this businessThese were  MacBumbo Mother Jenky  and  Jack  the  Ratcatcher  With three such adepts what business could prove difficultIn short they so  smoothed enforced and softened things  that the whole affairs were settled before you could say  Jack Robinson  John  and the  Nurse  had now appointed the day for the celebration of the NuptialsAnd  John  and  She  had invited all the guests who were vastly too numerous to mentionAnd a deal of good wholesome eatables and drinkables there was according to the fashion of  John  s table which never consisted of fricassees and ragouts and whipt syllabubs like Louis Baboon'sbut was a solid substantial steady feedThe punch was excellent and very  nappy  it was of  Pam  's composition who was accounted a  dab  at mixing the ingredientsAnd  John  being in rare spirits drank about pretty freelyAt last he got very noisy and very voiceferous on the occasionand sitting near the  Nurse  he filled her glass till she herself inspite of all her prudence and decorum got a little  pogy  She then proposed a hunting match to  John  of which diversion she said she was distractedly fondNow says she there is a damned sly  Fox  upon these grounds which I have long been after and I should have great pleasure to unkennel and have a compleat course with him and I warrant you says she snapping her fingers one day or other I will have the damned rogue hip and thigh  John  protested he would be one of the party and although says he I have long since parted with all my huntersby George I will mount my  DrayHorse  rather than not attend  you on such precious sport From this time and full of this noble idea  John  began to grow most damnably drunk and insisted upon singing a hunting song the chorus of which was certainly not the first rateflight of poetical fancy  "Let us crush traitor  Fox  tally ho tally ho"  This he roared so confounded loud and so long and so much like a man who was passed all power of sentiment sense or reflection that many of his guests who were in their sober senses were quite disgusted and scandalized at the ridiculous absurd and beastly manner in which he exposed himself not only to the company but to all the neighbours who were perfectly astonished at  John  's childishness and folly on this occasion and holding up their hands confessed that they never had seen him make so wretched a figure in all their lives The sober and decent part of the company now slipt off by degrees and left the  Nurse  and mother  Jenky  to put  John  to bed  Here the new married couple were as we suppose left in the dark as we have also been by contemporary historians Nothing having ever yet transpired respecting a consummation which was so devoutly wished for by the  Nurse  and all her associatesAll therefore that a  faithful historian can do is to supply the defects of certainty by the most probable conjectures supported by circumstances  John Bull  was undoubtedly drunk and a drunken man cannot be supposed to be the most agreeable bedfellow to a young woman of high blood and warm imagination Be this as it mayand altho' the young Bride appeared rather gloomy and disconcerted on the ensuing day yet she had so many fine things given her by  John  and the  Nurse  such dresses such jewels such laces and ribbons and favours and other fine things that in short she became wonderfully satisfied and elevated with her new situation  CHAP V  The custom that prevailed of choosing servants for John's WifeRenard puts up for that honour Is eagerly opposed by the Nurse and young Pam the East country clerks old Padagra and Pelf but is as warmly supported by most of his old friends and many new acquired onesSister Peg and John's first cousin Paddy Shillaily both strive to serve him and John himself feels a sincere love and regard for himHis character and that of his rival Pam  IT is highly necessary to acquaint my readers with a circumstance relating to  John  's family which perhaps they may never before have heard of and that is the singular custom of choosing servants for Mrs  Bull  It is no doubt common in most private families for the lady to choose her own servants But that was not the case in  John  's where it had been customary from time immemorial to leave the choice intirely to the family at large  Among many who put up for the honor of serving Mrs  Bull Renard  was one of the most conspicuous and so he went about to solicit  the vote of every one individual in the house It will no doubt appear extremely singular to those who read this extraordinary history that not withstanding the ridiculous and extravagant fancy  John  took of blaming of  Renard  merely out of complaisance to the  Nurse  and young  Pam  yet he could not help loving him sincerely There was to say truth a great similarity in their characters in many respects For  Renard  with the most uncommon talents joined extreme good nature an openness a frankness and sincerity which are extremely engagingHe was ambitious it is true but he was very disinterested and careless to a fault about money Every transaction with him was above board and he strove not even to conceal his own follies He followed the dictates of his passions and pursued his point without any dissimulation or affectation  On the other hand his rival  Pam  was artificial from top to toe every action every jesture were the effects of deliberation and studyHis talents were not contemptible but they were brought into play before they were ripe and those premature parts partook so much of hardness and acerbity that it seemed extremely doubtful if ever they would mellow so  as to become fit for any useful purposeHis great talent and that indeed in which he shewed a peculiar felicity was his collecting and keeping together a gang of the most cosummate scoundrels that ever infested any private familyknowing nothing of mankind he was tempted to supply that deficiency by cunning deceit and duplicity which in the end cut him up by the rootsHe was extremely vain presumptuous and selfsufficient These created the most compleat arrogance insolence and petulance so that he spared neither rank age abilities nor experience These disgustful passions naturally predominant in haughty minds were much increased by the great notice and sudden preferment procured him by the  Nurse  This he attributed wholly to his own superiority little thinking that the  Nurse  was as cunning and deceitful as himself and that it was not his abilities that recommended him but because she knew he was young and was in great hopes he might be implicitly led in all his conduct by herself and mother  Jenky  This was the true cause of the preference and most certain it is that the more mean the more plyable the more humble and subservient the more likely he was to become and to continue a favorite with the  Nurse  who valued  no talents but such as were useful to herselfwho felt no attachments but to those who were devoted to her will and who never had a friend she would not sacrifice or betray whenever he should differ in opinion from herselfor presume to act contrary to her inclination  Pam  however was really not known to  John  who had taken him into his service merely by the  Nurse  's recommendation who spoke of him in the highest terms and  John  when questioned by any of his friends about this ridiculous choice and when they alledged to him that it was absolutely impossible for a schoolboy to manage his complicated affairsused to to reply  "It signifies not a groat I have a good opinion of the boy and he has never yet done any harm nor has he been guilty of any trick that I know of and am persuaded he'll come to understand my business as well as the wisest of them give him timegive him time says  John  he'll do he'll doI warrant him"  But notwithstanding this strange harum scaram conduct of  John  'sstill he could not forget his old friendship for  Renard  and therefore he wished to see him in his Wife's service although he had approved of his dismission  from his ownaccordingly he assisted him all he could as did many belonging to sister  Peg  's family and also to the family of  Paddy Shillaily John  's first cousin In short they so bustled and so laboured and so canvassed that they succeeded against all the intrigues of the  Nurse  and  Pam  and the  East countryclerks  and the old  Counts Padagra  and  Pelf  who had joined in order to oppose himBut the most curious part of the story is that after  Renard  had carried his point  Pam  in order to ingratiate himself still more with the  Nurse  denied the fact and swore manfully that he was not chosenas did also  Loyd  the  Baker  and several other perjured vagabonds who as a cloak to their knavery pretended great knowledge of old rules and ordersand others again assumed a mighty tenderness of consciencewhich is the old stale pretext of the most consummate rogues and hypocrites  Notwithstanding all which  Renard  won the day to the great distress and vexation both of the  Nurse  and  Pam  whose character suffered much by his glaring malicious and rascally conduct in this affair  John  himself who had been so compleatly blindfolded began now to open his eyes to this obstinate and deceitful stripling  but he had been too much taken in by him and had gone too far in his foolish admiration to retreat all of a sudden and therefore he found himself under the necessity of still vindicating him from any bad intentionsbut affairs soon occurred which opened his eyes very compleatly as we shall have occasion to relate more at large in the sequel of this most useful history which I verily believe to be the real mother of wisdom  CHAP VI  Pam and Strumbolo the Coal Merchant make love to the late  Mrs Bull's  daughter ReformiaThey are very coldly received  I Have before related that the late excellent woman Mrs  Bull  left behind her one daughter who was to say truth both a comely and a bouncing wench as one could set their eyes upon and being now in the bloom of youth she failed not to attract a numerous suite of admirers  I will not pretend to say that these no more than other modern lovers were all passionate and disinterested adorersFar from it most  of them had heard of the great supposed fortune left by her mother's willand besides they knew that of late years she was become a mighty favorite with  John  himself who had been often heard calling lustily for her to come and attend him as much as she could  This being the case it was naturally enough for those who were desirous of ingratiating themselves with  John  to make up to his young favourite and amongst those who at present stood forward to recommend themselves most to Mr  Bull  was the famous  Strumbolo  the coal crimp a person fully blacker in his mind than in his professionHe was one of those dull industrious plodding fellows who are eternally employed in investigating profoundly the mereest trifles and are never happy but when they are pocking their heads into some nasty enquiry about other peoples affairs and this always under the pretext of preventing  John  from being imposed uponSometimes he would be going about to see how all the shirts sheets and stockings of the family were washed and spying with his magnifying glass to see if any stains were left or if the laundress adhered strictly to her contract At another time you might see  Strumbolo  busy in getting warrants to arrest some old and faithful servants of  John  's who had passed their days and risked their lives in his serviceThe tryal and punishment of that sort of men for little petty offences and oppressing them by the weight of his authority was a supreme delight to  Srumbolo  who had a mortal antipathy to that valour and intrepidity in others which he knew he had not in himselfLike an old maid who repines to see the young and the gay in possession of those enjoyments she can never taste and whose envy and malice exerts itself to embitter their pleasuresAt another time you might see this archfiend with a great stick in his hand knocking down and otherwise abusing all the poor superannuated pensioners who were worn out in the service of  John  and his family  "You damned scoundrels says  Strumbolo  you coming here and get your bellies filled and carry home victuals for your families and all forsooth upon the ridiculous pretext that you have served the family for sixty or seventy years and are no longer fit for labourA fine reason truly quoth  Strumbolo  because I maintain a man twenty years I must perforce maintain him twenty years more whether I have any use for him or noI'll allow no such abuses and impositions go and get your living where you canYou pretend that at your time of life you are not able to work why the devil then should we pay you for what you cannot do"  Then  Strumbolo  never saw a tradesman approach the house but what he would have a squeeze at him  "You dog you says he you overcharge your bills I know you do I could have the same business done for the one hundredth and fifty sixth part of a penny cheaper than what you have done you are a very great impostor and I'll have you turned out of your employment for ever you may go and starve you and your familyBut I suppose you have taken care of that you have already feathered your nest I have been informed by two or three of your neighbours with whom you have quarreled that you have saved money so that you must certainly be a very sad scoundrel indeed"  Now all this time while  Strumbolo  was thus grinding the face of the poor he was pocketing a very handsome perquisite by his coaltrade which from every mean minute and dirty detail he was hoarding up and accumulating to an amazing sum so that the fellow who had really the mean mind of a coal crimp was now become as rich as a lord  Amongst others of  Srumbolo  's good qualities he was a strange wrangling fellow and loved disputation and bustle and business such as it wasFrom this love of business he sometimes  led  John  into needless expence and if any of the family found fault with it and he saw himself in any scrape and that an action was brought against him he had art enough to contrive to pack his jury and to be chosen foreman himself by which means it was easy to see that no harm could ever befall him  This respectable personage was some how or other allied to the  Nurse  by the wrong side of the blanketsand it was by means of this connection that he had been let into his profitable perquisitesHe was himself very vain of the connectionBut she on the other hand though she carried fair with him yet did she hate him most cordially  Strumbolo  was exceedingly desirous of being well with  John  a thing which was not very likely to be for his character was one of those that  John  most detested and despisedBut in order to get into his good graces he now made love to  Reformia  with all the assiduity and vigour he was master of  Strumbolo  was not however of that turn of temper or disposition that could make much impression upon a young handsome girl's heartHe was naturally serious rigid and austere and had nothing  like mirth or good humour about himIt is true he could be extremely well bredbut he never exerted his politeness so much as when wanted to do an injury to deceive and betray or when he was afraid of the resentment of the person he was treating withA feeling which he was indeed very susceptible of for nobody had greater apprehensions about his own personal safety than  Strumbolo  who had been compelled on various occasions to make very mean and humiliating submissions rather than expose his person to a hearty drubbing which he often had occasion to dread but always had  an alacrity  to shunNow whether  Reformia  had discovered this failing of  Strumbolo  's I will not pretend to sayCertain it is the fair sex are very fond of that virtue which seems to be the distinguishing mark of a manly character and as there were public proofs of the infamous cowardice of  Strumbolo  all his prossessions of profound admiration and all his flattery had no effectHowever the dog knew what importunity would do and therefore he continued to lay hold of every occasion to tell the lady that she was the most perfect beauty in the world that every body admired her that he for his part wished to see her in every public place diffusing her benign influence universally  over all ranks and conditions of men that there was grace in all her steps heaven in her eye in every gesture dignity and love  Pam  too was a rival lover but even less serious and less sincere perhaps than the former He was however no less desirous than  Strumbolo  to make his court to  John Bull  through the young favourite He therefore made his addresses inform and attacked the fair one with all the pomp of words for not being a passionate admirer he could better command his expressionsand used to pour forth her praise in words of sixfeet longBut alas his reputation among the ladies had not quite as many inches in lengthBesides notwithstanding the pretended violence of his passion he never went to her alone but had always some friend along with him as if he had been afraid of too private an interviewsometimes he carried along with him  Jack  the  Ratcatcher  sometimes  MacBumbo  and rather than go alone he would even take mother  Jenky  and what is very odd while he was discoursing his mistress in the most lofty expressions of admiration and  Eulogy  he was all the while making damned faces apart to his friends with now and then a sly wink and nod as much as to say don't you  believe I am serious this is a mere farce I am carrying on only to secure  John  's good opinionBut I know the  Nurse  hates  Reformia  Mrs  Bull  considers her as a step daughter and has no affection for her and I myself would rather be crucified than have any thing do with her  It is shrewdly suspected the young lady saw through all this grimace and hypocricy of  Pam  and conceived a great dislike to him besides his charcter among the fair sex did not  stand very high  on the contrary he was rather considered as a frigid friend to the sex and one who was too great an admirer of himself ever to make a warm lover or a kind husbandIt was likewise currently reported that at this time  John Bull  who was not remarkable for seeing farther into an unbored millstone than his neighbours began however to perceive that  Pam  was only toying with his daughter merely for the sake of pleasing him and that he was in fact like many others only a cake and pudding wooer However such was  John  's prepossession at this time or rather his dislike to appear to have been compleatly taken in by this pompous and petulant  Younker  that rather than expose his weakness and folly he chose to disguise or conceal his own growing disgust  CHAP VII  A short account of John Bull's first Cousin Paddy ShiliailyHis characterHis ill treatment by John in his youthHis good sense and great care of his estateHe takes advantage of John's long litigation with his Westcountry tenantry to get rid of those shackles John had unjustly imposed upon him  BEFORE I proceed further in the history of  John Bull  it is necessary I should here inform my courteous reader that  John  had a first cousin by the mother's side whose name was  Paddy Shillaily  He though somewhat younger than  John  was educated at the same school with him and together with very good talents had something infinitely droll about him He was a very faithful friend and had on all occasions showed himself much attached to his cousin even in the worst of times  John  who felt himself stronger than  Paddy  had gained a vast ascendency over him and I must confess did not altogether use him with that liberality and generosity which so strongly marked his character in his dealings with others Not but that he would  have defended him from the insults or abuse of any other person to the last drop of his blood But on the other hand he himself assumed the privilege of maltreating and greatly oppressing  Paddy  and so buffeted and crushed him and knocked him about that it was the opinion of every body that he had in some measure stunted the poor lad's growth and had prevented him from applying with spirit to his book and to his profession which was somewhat in the nature of  John  's own line in the manufacturing branch  Notwithstanding all this however  Paddy  turned out a fine promising lad He was as brave as steel and would rather have a quarrel upon his hands than otherwise He was a good scholar and a very sensible man but had a queer defect in his opticks which often prevented him from seeing his object very correctly or in its proper point of view  The same inaccuracy was remarkable in his modes of expression and  Paddy  's elocution was often so embarrassed so perplexed and blundering that it frequently afforded much mirth and fun to his companions But it was very necessary for them to make it appear that they were laughing with him and not at him  otherwise they must take the consequences  Paddy  's sentences like the oracles of  Delphi  would generally admit of various interpretations but it truly might be said of him that if his utterance was bad his meaning was good He had a species of sarcastic wit peculiar to himself and his vein of humour however pleasant was seldom without its sting He was by nature prone to be somewhat rude boisterous and forward nor were an over diffidence or bashfulness ever ranked amongst the number of his foibles but when he was sufficiently justled and rubbed about in the world which he certainly required to take off his rust and rough corners no metal could take a brighter polish and one might surely pronounce him to be a clever manly and generous fellow as any you would wish to see  Paddy  's paternal estate which was very considerable lay just over against  Bullock'shatch  on the other side of the river and  John  and  He  lived together in terms of intimacy and good neighbourhood keeping up a very pleasant and friendly intercourse excepting when little differences happened upon matters of self interestAnd what relations friends or neighbours do not frequently differ upon that subject  John  sensible of his own superior strength  and the ascendency he had acquired at school always took the upperhand and would allow of no interference in his branches of trade If however  Paddy  was inferior to  John  in point of strength or trade or income he made up for these difficiences by a very commendable virtue which was a strict and rigid oeconomy When  John  was engaged in any of his ridiculous lawsuits  Paddy  did not grudge to lend him all the assistance he could But he would never run himself in debt or mortgage his estate as  John  had done so that he had a great advantage over him in going to market with ready money by which means he got every thing much cheaper and people would work for him at lower wages knowing their pay was sure and no deduction to be made on account of law expences or interest of money borrowed or the like which was a very common custom with  John  who used to squeeze his weavers and other manufactures with stoppages in such a manner that at the end of the week they had not two thirds of their wages to receive which greatly distressed them and their families  The day was now come when by means of these cursed expensive litigations  John  's nose was most damnably in the dirt for  Lewis Baboon Lord Strut Nic Frog  and  Yankey  were all upon  him at the same time so that he was really sore beset and his finances very low  Paddy  then bethought himself that now or never was the time for a great exertion to set himself free and to get entirely out of  John  's clutches  This he executed in a bold and masterly manner and told  John  fairly that he would no longer be bound and tied down by rules and regulations of his making but would make them for himself in future and he now claimed many privileges from which he had hitherto been debarred  John  at present felt himself fairly down and therefore made a virtue of necessity by yielding many points which he thought might be useful to his Relation without much injuring himself These well judged concessions were first managed by  Boreas  and afterwards by  Renard  with the advice and consent of the late Mrs  Bull  ever watchful for  John  's interest and were the cause of great cordiallity and mutual satisfaction to both parties  CHAP VIII  A brief narrative of the state of sister Peg's health and how she stood affected on the present occasionMacBumbo tampers with her Chaplain who conducts himself with great good sense and dignity  IT is now full time I should give some little account of the tender state of health the occupations and sentiments of  John Bull  's own sister  Peg  who for some years past had been subject to the most grievous and oppressive fits of a lethargic disposition whieh had often rendered her in a manner senseless and stupid and unfit for business This shocking distemper did not however prevent her from attending to her own domestic concerns to which she was now become extremely attached  Instead of law divinity and literature which had formerly engrossed all her attention she had become very seriously engaged in the cultivation of her paternal estate in building huts for weavers in spinning and carding bucking and bleaching and such like  Peg  notwithstanding in her lucid intervals was roused at times when she heard that  John  's affairs were in danger or distressFor she well knew that at present whatever affected him must very essentially affect herself She was therefore much concerned when she was informed of the untimely death of the late Mrs  Bull  and the unhappy fate of her sister  Darling Privilege  who every body concluded had perished along with her Many illjudged and oppressive things were also done by  Pam  to  Peg  's weavers and other manufacturers which helped very much to disgust her However  MacBumbo  who as I have related was formerly in  Peg  's service did every thing in his power to flatter and coax her And he likewise from time to time gave her some little paultry presents which had always a great effect with her who from habits of poverty and oeconomy was now become if possible more selfish and interested than ever Though she had certainly less occasion than formerly having by attention and industry filled her pockets pretty handsomely But in this weakness she was not singular since every body knows that it is the way of the world for mankind to become more stingy and avaricious as they become more opulent  Amongst others who were in high favour with  Peg  was her chaplain a very honest pious and learned person in whom  Peg  placed great confidence and had very justly great regard and friendship for him Indeed she had another reason for her attachment to him besides those I have here mentioned For it is well known that  Peg  was extravagantly fond of preaching and praying and singing of psalms and all manner of spiritual songs and in these her chaplain indulged her completely giving her from time to time such dozes of them as would have perfectly surfeited any moderate christian  To him therefore  MacBumbo  paid great court and wished very much to have had him send a letter of congratulation to the  Nurse  on her having so successfully accomplished her plan of dismissing  John  's late servants  MacBumbo  was perfectly aware that the chaplain had always been very sincerely attached to the  Nurse  and her family and really wished her well he did not therefore doubt but he could have persuaded him to have given his sanction by approving of her conduct on this occasion But he was infinitely mistaken for the worthy and pious man rejected the proposal  with great disdain and with much dignity and good sense he absolutely refused to countenance a measure which he thought reflected so little honor upon the perpetrators of it  CHAP IX  Pam proposes setling all matters of trade between John Bull and Paddy ShillailyPam is infected with the distemper in Paddy'  s  opticksHe opens his proposal to Paddy and then to Mrs BullJohn starts and bouncesPam opiniatres itHis childish and ignorant method of conducting business  PAM  was so much pleased with his impotent and ineffectual plan for setling the  East country business  That he thought it would do him  equal honor  to carry through  as great  and  as wi  e  a measure for adjusting and finally arranging the affairs of  John Bull  and  Paddy Shillaily  In contemplating this grand and glorious object  Pam  was struck all of a heap with the giddy staggers in his head which confounded his opticks to that degree that one would have sworn he had been  compleatly infected by  Paddy  In short he felt himself so perplexed and so blunderheaded that he was quite at a loss which end of the business he should begin with or whether it might not be better to begin in the middleafter due deliberation this last plan pleased him mostSo he was determined to open the business to  Paddy  by informing him that if he would be pleased to accept of all  John  's weaver's looms and manufactures whatsoever that he was sure in the present disposition in which  John  and his Wife were he would be answerable he should get them persuaded to assign over to him and his heirs for ever the whole of those advantages and that without any fee or reward excepting only that he meant to ask for  John  by way of reciprocity the surplus of a fund which had hitherto proved and always would prove deficient until  Paddy  should totally destroy and annihilate  John's  manufactures and commerce at which time he observed that from his wonderful penetration and sagacity he could foresee that this deficient fund would prove a productive one This proposition was so much beyond what  Paddy  had either wished or expected that his ears began to crow like chanticleer and he really doubted whether the young manager was not laying some snare for  him and that he meant to take him in for at this time every body began to suspect his sincerity however having viewed it on all sides he could see no bad consequence from receiving a great deal for which he was to pay nothing but the surplus of a deficiency which  Paddy  concluded could not be very ruinous to him as it would not probably take  much of his ready money  out of his pocket  He therefore determined to accept and told  Mr Pam  so  Pam  who had thus begun in the middle was now determined to take matters by the right end and so he goes next to  Mrs Bull  with whom he still continued to be a wonderful favourite for she knew he and his runners had had a great hand in making the match for herHe up and told  Mrs Bull  in the presence of a large company what he had done and of the proposals he had made to  Paddy  and how ready and obliging he had been in accepting what was so much to his advantageand he did not at all doubt but that  John Bull  would approve of his plan as it was much better to give his trade his looms and every thing to  Paddy  rather than live in ill humour with so near a Relation He then told  Mrs Bull  in his usual way and with a modesty peculiar to himself  for he had borrowed a little of what  Paddy had to spare  that his plan was one of the best that ever had been thought of by any human Creature  Boreas  he said and  Renard  and the late  Mrs Bull  had perfectly botched this business for they had agreed to give away all that he intended to give but they were to get nothing in return whereas he had secured a very useful reciprocity by engaging  Paddy  to pay  John  the surplus of a deficient fund which  Paddy  had very readily agreed to knowing that such a sum could not possibly hurt him and that in matters of such magnitude a sum like that was neither here nor there nor  any where at all at all  Pam  was so enchanted with his own superior wisdom in transacting this melancholly piece of business that in short there was no end to the praise and panegyric he bestowed on himself and the reproaches he threw out upon his predecessorsAnd as for  Mrs Bull  she was so charmed with the sound of his voice that to her it was of no consequence whether he spoke sense or nonsense or whether  she heard him or no  she made it a rule always to agree with him and I verily believe that if  Pam  had dared to propose to have incarcerated her husband or  even to have castrated him she would readily have assented by declaring she had so much confidence in  Pam  that she was sure that these or any other thing which he should propose would be for  her own  and her husband's advantage  John Bull  having been made acquainted with all this began now as well he might to be most seriously alarmed He had for some time been opening his eyes towards the conduct and character of  Mr Pam  and this compleated the businessHe therefore began to growl and bounce and swear like the devilThe weavers and manufacturers particularly had reason to complain seeing they were to be done for compleatlyThey therefore waited on  Mr Pam  and remonstrated bitterly  Pam  with his usual art and duplicity gave them all fair words assuring them that he would take the most tender care of their interest This assurance however  Renard  with that shrewdness which was natural to him soon discovered to be a mere trick and deception in order to keep them quiet till all was irrevocably fixedWhen this discovery was made these poor people who now perceived they had been compleatly duped  by this little cunning stripling began forthwith to solicit  Mrs Bull  and all their friends in her familyrepresenting in the strongest terms their distress and the danger and ruin to which they their wives and children would be exposedIn vain did  Boreas  and  Renard  and many other sincere friends of  John Bull  and his family interpose with his wife to mitigate the rigour of this ill concerted plan  Pam  was obstinate and of course  Mrs Bull  who was a mere creature of  Pam  's remained inflexible in spite of every thing that could be said upon the subject In short still mindful of his paternal profession for nature will out  Pam  now flattered himself he had found a nostrum and infallible specific for curing all heart burnings between  Paddy  and  John  Even Sir  Samuel Hannay's  famous specific is not more powerful or more effectual in preventing evils than was  Pam  's in his own opinion who was determined to risk every thing precious on this desperate experimentthe Constitution Vitals Body and Soul itself were all to be sacrificed to this boyish rage for prescription and quackery  And here it must be observed that when  Pam  was hard driven on any subject by the superior  abilities of  Boreas  and  Renard  there were two subjects to which he always had recourse to rouse the prejudices of  John  and his  Wife  and under which he run for shelter as a small frigate will do under the guns of a fortress when chased by a ship of superior force These favourite themes were the  West Country  litigation conducted by  Boreas  and the plan for regulating the  East Country  business proposed by  Renard  On which occasions there was a regular repetition of the stale story of encroaching upon the power and patronage of the  Nurse  of annihilating the old balance and regulations so long established in the familyof purloining all  John Bull  's charters and of confiscating the property of the  poor East Country Clerks  and all that endless Gibberish which had neither sense nor argumentAfter an exordium of this kind  Pam  next proceeded to praise his own amazing abilities and incorruptible integrity and from thence took occasion to attack with infinite insolence arrogance malice and spleen every person who should happen to differ from himself on any subjectand at the same time that he turned every thing they said into perfect ridicule and sneered at and reprobated  whatever they proposedyet was he very attentive all the while to catch up their ideas to mend his plan and would eke and patch up his crude abortions by degrees so that in the end they began to have something of form and feature and if not beautiful or correct they became at least less deformed and capable of being seen without abhorrence or detestation and in this shape they were imposed upon the world as his own progeny  And so it fared with his present plan for settling all affairs with  Paddy  A for the  Nurse  these were matters in which it was pretended she had no swayIt was however very well known that she was privately consulted by  Pam  and it was as well understood that she gave him her directions through mother  Jenky  and that he obeyed them as implicitly as he was obeyed by  Mrs Bull  In this business no body precisely knew the sentiments of the  Nurse  as she was at pains to conceal them but as she had a great hatred and contempt for  John  and that  Pam  continued obstinate her opinion on the subject is scarcely to be doubted  The singularity of the situation into which this extraordinary personage had now brought  herself is well worth the observation of the curious not only of the present but of all future agesAll her jerks her writhings windings and turnings in order to command had in fact wrought a very different effect from what she wished or expected It is true she enjoyed the supreme gratification of a little present revenge and the sovereign satisfaction of apparent power but to those who look into and examine affairs more intimately it will plainly appear to what a dilemma and into what trammels the  Nurse  had precipitated herself by her own egregious absurdity and follyWith better management she might have preserved equal sway by working one set of servants against the other and still have maintained her own power but by totally discharging the ablest the most responsible and those who were best supported by the old established and wealthy yeomanry on  John  's lands she was creating an endless fund of powerful and irresistible opposition to her plans Besides she was now compleatly at the mercy of all those proud and petulant spirits who then commanded in the counting house  She had thus left herself without alternative and was exposed to the caprice of the daring  and stern  Surly  to the vanity and petulance of the supercilious and pompous  Pam  to the insolence and obstinacy of the vexatious and malignant  Strumbolo  So that her sole consolation was her having in the rest of the servants a set of eminent  Ninnies  wholly at her command because unable  Caetera desunt
