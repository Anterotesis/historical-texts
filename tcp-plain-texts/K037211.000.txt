In magnis voluisse sat est  LONDON Printed for L DAVIS and C REYMERS in Holborn and J  AYN  in PaternosterRow MDCCLXVI  ADVERTISEMENT  THE success which a juvenile sketch of this Play hath met with in publication having induced the Author to bring it on the stage he flatters himself the alterations which were thought necessary to accommodate it to a theatrical audience will not give less satisfaction to the reader than such scenes as he was obliged on that account to reject  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr DODD in the Character of MERCURY  Mercury descends from the clouds flying across the stage Reenters followed by a servant carrying a counsellor's gown and wig  A LA MERCURE  equipp'd from top to toe  My godship's name and quality you know  Commission'd from Apollo I come down  T'attend this bench of justices the town  Assembled here all members of the quorum  To lay a matter of complaint before 'em  The errand's not in character 'tis true  But what our betters bid us we must do  Therefore t'appear with decency at session  I've stole you see the garb of the profession  This gown and band belong to serjeant Prig  And thisour brother Puzzle's learned wig  Putting on the gown c  Dress makes the man Sirs  vestis virum facit    Sonow to businessHem  si vestris placet    May't please your worshipsForgery which is grown  To such a height as ne'er before was known  I say a forgery hath been committed  By which king Pluto's mirmidons outwitted  Certain choice spirits in theatric shape  Have suffer'd from Elisium to escape  Of Shakespeare's offspring and ideal train  Sprung Pallas like from an immortal brain  Their namesI have 'em downbut to be brief  Shall only just enumerate the chief  Imprimis with Madeira swell'd and sack  There's Sir John Falstaff alias call'd Plump Jack  Next captain Pistol a notorious bully  And Miss Dol Tearsheet fam'd for jilting cully  The widow Quickly vintner bawd and whore  With Bardolph Peto Nym andseveral more  Link'd in a gang each cutpurse with his crony  All arrant thieves and  Dramatis Personae    Bent as suppos'd to prostitute to shame  Th' aforesaid Shakespeare's honour name and fame  I shall not trespass on your worship's time  T' explain at full the nature of this crime  But Poets having an exclusive right  To bring their mental progeny to light  This right's invaded by the party 'peach'd  Who  vi et armis  hath th' old bard o'erreach'd  By counterfeiting of his hand do ye see  Feloniously to set these vagrants free  With base design t'adopt them for his own  Tho' Shakespeare's property and his alone  Such is the factA critic were an ass  No doubt to let such imposition pass  Nor could a cheat so palpable succeed  But that the captain of the guard cou'dn't read  No not for laughing tho' to've sav'd his soul  The scene and circumstances were so d roll  Pistol with yellow nightcap patch'd with red  With Mother Quickly was retir'd to bed  And waking swore by Styx he would not come  Sans preparation pike and beat of drum  Of  aquavitae  having stole a flaggon  Bardolph and Nym were playing at snapdragon  Sometimes proceeding from hard words to blows  As by mistake Nym seiz'd on Bardolph's nose  With Falstaff sat Dol Tearsheet cheek by joll  And while she buss'd his chin and scratch'd his poll  Slipp'd from his thumb his grandfire's copper ring  For love not for the value of the thing  Then stole his empty purse but no abuse  'T was only done to keep her hand in use  He swearing he'd be damn'd as soon as trust his  Round belly more with Hall or his chiefjustice  But this is wandering

Cupid in the neighbourhood 'sblood my legs will fail me ere I reach a tavern PhooPhooIt is some comfort however I escap'd with my life The greenapron'd rascals crouding after the procession had well nigh made an end of me  SCENE II  Enter BARDOLPH  Bar  O Sir John I'm glad I have found ye I was in the fearfullest quandary for you in the world I hope your honour has got no hurt  Fal  Not its death's wound I hope though Hal indeed look'd somewhat cold upon me  Bar  Cold Sir John I am afear'd we shall be in limbo shortly for my Lordchiefjustice  Fal  Hold thy illomen'd croaking If faithful services are thus requited I will turn cordwainer yea cobler and heel piece old shoes ere I have to do with bloodroyal again Ingratitude I hate it  Bar  To be sure Sir John what you say is right for as the song says ingratitude is worse than the sin of witchcraft But I hop'd your honour got no personable harm in the mob you was carried off the terras for all the world like a danghil from Millbank by a springtide  Fal  Bardolph away with thy filthy comparisons I am ill at ease and more dispos'd to spleen than to merriment I prythee look out and see if there be a bawdyhouse at hand  Bar  What here so near the court Sir John  Fal  Where better 'Sblood dost think there are no whores at Court Are there no dames of honour Dost think Hal hath banish'd them too Look out look out  Bar  I will Sir John  Exit  Bardolph  SCENE III  Sir JOHN FALSTAFF solus  I would I were in Eastcheap Mine hostess hath a most excellent cordial and I never stood in more need of it than now The gross indignity Hal hath put on me sticks in my throat and in the end may go near to choak me I shall never gulp it down that's flat unless indeed a full cup of sherris help to clear the way And then how I shall stomach it how I shall digest it heaven knows At present both my person and knighthood are in jeopardy my Lordchiefjustice to whose care I am commended holding me not altogether in good liking But no matterif I am to be provided for what avails it who is my caterer I could wish nevertheless old white wine stood higher in his Lordship's favour that I may not be stinted at table or in my bydrinkings I like notsuch splenetic temperaments such phlegmatic constitutions greybeards that never make allowances for the continual waste of radical moisture'Sblood  I am as foundered and as sore as a blind horse in a millBardolph where a plague art thou gotten to caterwauling  SCENE IV  Enter Mrs QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET  Quick  O Sir John Falstaff  Doll  O sweet Sir John  Fal  How mine hostess and my good vestal Mrs Tearsheet save ye gentlewomen both goodmorrow  Host  Godild ye Sir Johnwell I vow and protest an I didn't say he would take as civil notice of his old acquaintance nay tho'f he was created by my lordmayor of London  Doll  What talk ye of lordmayors and fusty citizens gossip Quickly Sir John is a courtier and to be sure we must gratulate him now as one of the greatest knights in the nationO sweet Sir John  Fal  Truce with your formalities Mrs Dorothy Pray have you seen none of our followers by the way Pistol nor Peto  Quick  No verily Sir John not oneWe have seen nothing of any of them to day They are all gone to the coronation I warrant and indeed we should have been there too hadn't it been for that wicked villain constable Fang that by a mistake of the beadle of our ward would have carried us to Bridewel this morning  Fal  How mine hostess and my fair Dorothy to Bidewel  Quick  Even to Bridewel I can assure ye  Fal  But how how dame Quickly to Bridewel a  ecent churchgoing widow and a modest maiden I  hould say single gentlewoman to a house of correction  hy what  Quick  So I said Sir John Nuthook Nuthook says  do you know what you do says IHave me to Bride  l says II say to Bridewel indeed a ruptable house  keeper that has paid scot and lot and born the burthen of half the parish any time these twenty years  Fal  That thou hast hostess of the male half I'll be sworn for thee  Quick  Besides says I do you know Sir John Falstaff says ITouch a hair of Mrs Dorothy's head says I and Sir John will make you smart for it says I ev'ry bone in your skin says I  Fal  And what said the rascal to that  Quick  Said Sir John he stood mumchance and spoke never a living syllable but set his vinegarvisag'd catchpoles upon us who fastened their claws into Mrs Tearsheet's best kirtle and tore it into as many rents and tatters as there were in the old tapestry hangings I pawn'd to fit your honour out for the last expedition  Fal  Pshaw  Dol  Yes indeed Sir John made a mere tatterdemallion of me But we did so tongue the leatherear'd vultures  Fal  That they were glad to loose their gripe to get rid of you I suppose  Quick  Nay Sir John I was obliged to perduce an angel to convince them we were not the parties indicted  Fal  Infidel rogues would nothing less than the testimony of an angel convince them  Quick  Ay I knew how Sir John would take it O how soundly will the knave constable be swing'd for this a jackinoffice rascal we shall cure the blueskin'd runnion of his itch for whipping I warrant ye  SCENE V  Reenter BARDOLPH  Bard  I have been looking all about Sir John but I cannot find one  Quick  What is it Sir John wants Mr Bardolph  Bar  A bawdyhouse mistress  Quick  O JesuMaria Mrs Dorothy  Fal  How sirrah what call'st thou a bawdyhouse  I sent thee to look out for a house of civil entertainment where I might repose myself after my fatigue Why what you rogue would you make of me  Quick  Marry come up indeed a bawdyhouse truly but as to a house of civil entertainment Sir John here is one hard by where the knights and lords and all the great gentlemen of the court are entertained both by night and by day as civilly as at their own homes and by gentlewomen as kind to them I warrant ye as their own ladies themselvesA house of civil entertainment a bawdyhouse Why I keep a house of civility myself and I would have you to know Mr Bardolph  Bar  Nay nay 'tis all one what Sir John pleases  Quick  Yes by my truly and so I think it ought for if Sir John recommends you to the king  Dol  Nay were I Sir John I'm sure I would never promote such a clown as Bardolph at court  Bar  Ah Dol Dol I am afraid our promotion will be at the gallows If Sir John has any interest with the hangman he may get me preferr'd perhaps to the top of the ladder  Dol  Why how now varlet  Quick  Do you hear do you hear sweet Sir John  Fal  Ay hostess Bardolph is somewhat blunt but as for the king  Quick  Heav'ns bless him a sweet young prince he was and to be sure a gracious king he is But what of him Sir John  Fal  Why marryhang him hostessTreason must out as well as murder  Quick  I am 'maz'd Sir John why how is this what a goodness whenwhere  Dol  How is this good Bardolph  Fal  Why I will tell ye how it is That same ungrateful speaking pitiful rascal we are speaking of is turn'd fanatick  Quick  Fanatick the king a fanatick  Fal  Ay fanatick presbyter bishop if you will Let his crown be his mitre I care not  Dol  We don't take your meaning Sir John  Fal  You must know then Dol that after having in pure love and affection ridden post day and night fourscore and odd miles to congratulate him on his accession and condole with him on his father's death instead of bidding me welcome to court he preached me my own funeral sermon  Quick  A funeral sermon  Fal  Ay hostess for at the end of his discourse he order'd me to be buried alive at ten miles distance from the court And to make this unnatural interment the surer he has appointed my Lordchiefjustice his undertaker to see to the disposal of my corpse  Quick  Buried alive quoth he what what is in all this  Fal  In plain terms dame Quickly your gracious king hath banished me the presence and till he grows a graceless prince again I am forbidden to approach his person within ten miles on penalty of being hang'd Take ye me now  Quick  O Jesu is it possitable  Dol  Ah ha is it so sits the wind in that quarter  Quick  Well as I am an honest woman who would have thought it it is a world to see  Dol  And so Sir John is in disgrace still plain Jack Falstaff and one of us ha ha ha poor blown Jack  Quick  A sad disappointment indeed Sir John but in good faith things fall out so odd and the world goes so wrong and the times are so hard that here there why no longer ago now than yesterday was I obliged to pay the lordknowswhatall away for one thing or other and then my misfortune to day an angel to the constables and besides this comes the day after to morrow when I must make up a sum for the winemerchant wherefore if your honour would but discharge your score in Eastcheap because as why your honour knows  Fal  How's this dame Quickly  Quick  Because I say as why your honour knows seventy odd pound is a great deal of money for a poor widow woman to lose  Fal  What talk you of losing hostess  Quick  True Sir John as you say to be sure I shall not be willing to lose it for the law is open and I know which way to get my money  Fal  I am glad thou dost hostess as in that case I need not give myself the trouble to pay thee The law is open say'st thou Ay like a mousetrap on the catch for nibbling clients Enter thy action and I will hold thee a gallon of sack thy departed husband will get out of purgatory ere thou out of the hands of thy lawyer  Quick  Nay Sir John you need not twit me upon that You need not fling my poor husband's soul in my teeth He has not been gone so long tho' for the matter of that he might have been in heav'n before now hadn't I lent you the money Mr Dumb should have had to say masses for him Yes Sir John you have put into that great belly of yours what should have got my poor husband out of purgatory and now you reproach me for it Had he been still alive you would not have us'd his disconsolate widow thus You wouldn't Sir John  Fal  No I'll be sworn I should not  Quick  Well then Sir John out of charity if it were nothing else you ought to repay the money Nay if you don't I'll pray night and day that you may be haunted by his ghost Heav'n rest his soul I would he might  ever sleep quietly in his grave till he has made you  ay me  Fal  Go to thou art a foolish woman with good  ords thou may'st be paid  Quick  No Sir John good words will not do I must  ave money Sir John The priests won't get a soul out  purgatory without money Besides Sir John good  ords are no payment I can get no body to take them  od words will not do with me  Fal  Well well I say you may be paid  Quick  May Sir John I mustYou have thus  ffled off and on me a good while but I must I must  paid I must  Fal  Heigh heigh wilt thou raise the neighbourhood on us If thou art clamorous I will have thee duck'd  in the Thames for a bawd What aplague art thou drunk On the honour of my knighthood thou shalt be paid Dost thou doubt mine honour  Quick  Why Sir John to be sure nobody would scruple to conside in your honour's honour but then you know Sir John nobody better what honour is It will buy neither coals nor candles nor will my landlord take it for rent nor the merchant for sack or sherry But would you give me only the half in money and leave the rest to honour so that a body might keep open house Sir John That would be doing something  Fal  Nay if thou wilt be advis'd I will do more for theeBardolph forget not to go when I send thee to the cashier with whom I left a thousand pound this morning and tell him to satisfy Mrs Quickly forthwith  Quick  A thousand pound  Fal  The times are not so bad hostess thanks to our friend Shallow but we may yet have a merry bout in East cheapHow says my Dol  Dol  Nay you know sweet Jack I was always at your pleasure there  Quick  That I will say for her and a sweeternatur'd better hearted creature never lay by the side of a true man Bat goodness heart why do we tarry here when Sir John complain'd of his being fatigued and was looking for a house of civil entertainment I will shew you the way incontinently Sir John  Fal  I thank thee hostess I am now somewhat recruited and will endeavour to reach Eastcheap And ye a cap of sack by the way I think would not be amiss  Exeunt  SCENE VI Tavern in Eastcheap  Enter PISTOL and NYM  Pistol  Hang Pistol up with line of hempen string Ere he in rabbethutch be close immuredSeize the stiff cramp upon the fangs of justice  Nym  Marrytrap we shew'd his myrmidons a light pair of heels tho' I wonderwhat is become of Sir John They have certainly nailed his fat paunch We must not venture to the Fleet to see They'll nab us there and for the matter of that I suppose they'll be running the humour upon us here too I will incontinently go and shut myself up The storm may blow over when we are found uninventible  Pistol  Pistol disdains to skulk  Nolens  'tis fate But who would  volens  be incarcerate  Nym  we must eat and money have we none  Nym  True  nolus volus  as you say we must eat I like to starve like a rat behind the arras as little as another man But what shall we do if Sir John be in limbo  Pistol  Or  in  or  out  his follower I no more  Invention's mother is necessity  And Pistol's demon is an imp of wit  Merc'ry suggests and Pallas doth approve  The great Ponjardo del Stilletto's dead  Professor of the art of selfdefence  His broken foils his daggers belts and blades  The stock in trade I'll purchase upon tick  My face disguis'd with an usurped beard  These jutting eyebrows turn'd from black to red  Shall skreen from knowledge Thou shalt too assume  A borrowed excrement and partner be  In stock and block since fighting's grown a trade  Pence are pick'd up by masters of the blade  Nym  The thought is lucky Angels will ensue But must we not transmutify our names  Pistol  My brain's my godfather and at the font Me Don Anticho del Pistolo called  Nym  And pray what did this same godfather call me  Pistol  Signior Nymwego  Nym  Good Signior Nymwego and you

BARDOLPH  Quick  Is Sir John at hand Bardolph  Bar  He will be here incontinently hostess I only stept before to let you know he was a coming  Quick  But is it veritably true Bardolph that Sir John has got a thousand pound by him  Dol  Ay is that true Bardolph  Bar  True upon honour he had it of justice Shallow of Gloucestershire and it lies now in master Gingle cash the banker's hands But Sir John will be here momentably Is ev'ry thing ready  Quick  In a minute we are all clear Run good Dol and receive the knight at the door Francis what Francis  Fran  without Anon anon Sir  Quick  Light

quarters A glass of sherris Francis  Dol  And how do you find yourself my sweet knight  Fal  Tolerably thirsty  Drinks  I can drink and that is all the bodily functions I am capable of I am as sliff  ev'ry part about me as a walking taylor or Don Diego on a signpost  Dol  Nay Sir John if that be the case it is not over with you yet Give me a buss  Fal  Go Dol you are riggishget you gone you water wag tail you I am not merrily dispos'd  Dol  But will you give me a new kirtle at Bartlemew    Fal  I  ill DolNay I cannot bear you on my  ee  Dol  Why how came you so terribly maul'd my leman  Fal  Did not I tell ye  Quick  No indeed Sir John your honour spoke of fatigue but did not descend to particles  Fal  Well then I will tell ye now Give me first a glass of sherris  Drinks  You must know that after the king hang him for a sheepstealing cur gave me that rebuff I told you of he stalk'd majestically away and left me to the mercy of the multitude when as I stood parleying with mine antient mine arms a kembo thus a knot of elbowing carls bore me down before them with the impetuosity of a torrent Lo there was I jamm'd fast in the midst of a vile groupe of mechanics as if we had grown together in a body corporate and in this jeopardy was I carried along sometimes bolster'd up on all sides at the confluence of several turnings like a Maypole and at others wiredrawn between two stone walls as if they meant to make chitterlings of me now this fair round beliy taking the form of a Christmas pye and by and by press'd as slat as a pancake It is a miracle I did not burst in the midst of them Had it nor been for the sufficiency of my buff doublet I should have certainly bursted  Dol  If you had Sir John you would have went off with a report like a bladder  Fal  A bladder ye jade a demiculverin at least I should have died an hero my exit would have made some noise in the world  Quick  Heav'n forbid Sir John you should ever die a virulent death I say  Dol  I hope indeed sweet knight you will never be press'd to death That must be an odd end and yet methinks I could bear much  Fal  I'll be sworn thou could'st Dol but thou art a woman and made to bear  Quick  Yes in good sooth poor woman is made to bear ev'ry thing She must suffer all a man's ill humours let 'em lie never so heavy upon her and by my truly some men are nothing else But to be sure Sir John you was most unhumanly used Would no body take pity upon you  Fal  Pity the most remorseless rascals they made no more of me than if I had been a lump of dough they were kneading to make dumplings of and to expostulate with the villains would have been preaching to the winds  Dol  Why did not you exert your courage Sir John draw upon them  Fal  Draw sayst thou I could not come at my rapier to be master of a kingdom And as for good words in return for the few I gave them they let fly their jests so thick at me and pepper'd me so plaguly with small wit that I was dumbfounded  Dol  I thought you could never have been overmatch'd that way Sir John  Fal  Yet so it was Doll They were holidaywits and  ame loaden with chokepears bur indeed I was overcower'd by numbers Two to one Doll you knowThey pelted me from all quarters Will you hear I wiil give you a spice of their farcasms a sample of the gibing  ellets they threw at me As I was thus stemming the  de and crying out for the lord's sake a dried eel'ss  in  f a fishmonger ask'd me how I could complain of the  oud  Is a porpoise ill at ease said he amidst a glut of sprats and herrings  I had not time to answer the  elt before a barbersurgeon the very model of the skeleton  in his glasscase offered to tap me for the dropsy and to make us all elbowroom by letting out a puncheon of canary at my girdle Right cries a third at the word canary  I'll be hang'd if any thing be in the doublet of that fat rogue but a hog'sskin of Spanish wine  and incontinently they roar'd out on all sides  Tap him theretap him master surgeon  'Sblood I was forc'd to draw in my horns and be silent lest the villains being thirsty should force the shaver to operation The knave indeed was five weavers off and so could not well come at me I might otherwise have been drunk up alive  Dol  And pray how cam'st thou off at last Sir John  Fal  By mere providence for after the barbarous rascals had squeez'd the breath out of my body they buffetted me because I could not roar out God save the king At length I know not how they threw me down in the cloisters where falling crosswise and the way being narrow I fairly block'd up the passage upon which for they could not straddle over me they took another way a plague go with them for fear of losing the show And thus was I left to take in wind and gather myself up at leisure  Dol  And did the mangy villains so play upon thy sack but a parcel of sapless twigs dry elms fit only for fuel  I would I had the burning of them  Fal  Wouldst thou fire them Dol Ha art thou touch wood still Dol  Dol  Nay Sir John not so  Quick  No I'll be sworn Sir John to my carn  knowledge if there be truth or faith in medicine  Sir John what would your honour please to have supper  Fal  Another glass of sherrisfill me out Bardol I cannot eat I have lost my appetite by the way Put egg into a quart of mull'd sack and give it me when abed I will to sleep  Dol  Would you have your bed prepar'd strait John  Fal  Ay on the instant good Dol Hostess go thou and see to the brewage of my sack  Exeunt  Dol  and  Mrs Quickly  SCENE XI Tavern continued  Enter PISTOL and NYM  Pis  Sir Knight I bring thee news loud same reports My lordchiefjustice hath recall'd his warrants  Fal  I would he were choaked with his warrants ere he had issued them But I thank thee for the tidings The serjeants will not disturb my rest at least tonighr But what comes here  Pis  From duckingpond escaped in dripping plight  The crookedfinger'd cutpurse Peto hight  SCENE XII  Enter PETO leaning upon GADSHILL  Fal  What's the matter Peto  Gad  Matter Sir Knight and master of mine Matter faith enough The mob at Westminster had like to have murder'd poor Peto here  Fal  And how so  Gad  Why Sir John as he was getting upon a cobler's pulk to see what was become of your honour arawbon'd waggering serjeant coming by whipt hold of him by the  eg and threw him on the people's heads where they shoulder'd him about from post to pillar as they would have done a hedgehog or a dead rabbit that had been shrown among them I saith I thought they would have  ill'd him  Fal  How was that Peto I saw the bustle at a distance  and wonder'd what the porters and 'prentices had got to make sport withal By the Lord Peto I have a fellowfeeling for thy sufferings  Pis  And I But say is merit thus repaid Shall fortune play the jilt with men of mould Go Peto lay thy head in Parco's lap  Fal  Good Peto let me advise thee to go to bed And lay thy head on a pillow Bardolph see to him Pistol and Nym good night  Pis  and Nym Good night Sir John  Fal

well  Pis  Well Nym and thou and I o'er cup and can  Will go and schemes of operation plan  Exeunt  End of the First ACT  ACT II  SCENE I A Street  Enter Justice SHALLOW and Master SLENDER  Slen  I Wonder now Coz when you know what a desperate kind of a horrible man Sir John is you shou'd  Shal  Tut tutI fear him not there's ne'er a Sir John Falstaff in the nation shall over reach me  Slen  But what's done can't be help'd Coz he overreach'd you now as I take it when you lent him the money  Shal  Well cousin of mine then it is my turn now to overreach him and get it again  Slen  That indeed cousin Shallow to be sure would be quite right tit for tat as we say in the country but then he is such a bloodyminded caitiff you know he broke my head once for nothing at all and if he should get an inkling that you are going to law with him O Lord O Lord I shall never sleep in quiet again  Shal  Poh you chit if he breaks the peace I shall know what to do with him I warrant ye  Slen  Ay there indeed cousin ecod I did not think of that If I am in fear of my life I can answer taking him up with a warrant and binding him over to his good behaviour Suppose therefore Coz we swear the peace against him first and lay him fast by the heels before we enter the actionAnd yet I don't know if I might advise ye I would wash my hands of him  Shal  Talk not to me I tell thee I will spend half my estate ere the rascally knight shall carry it off so I had rather the inns of court should share the money among  them than that the gorbellied knave should feast his enormous guts at any freecost of mineI will to my council immediately and if the law will not avail me my sword shall do me justice  Slen  You know best cousin Shallow to be sure but  Shal  But me no buts I say but come along  Your cousin Shallow puts up no such wrong  Exeunt  SCENE II A Street  Enter an Officer of the King's Houshold and a FRIAR  Offic  There good friar thou hast it it would little conduce to raise the king's wisdom in the general estimation of the world to have it thought in the power of such unworthy men as Falstaff and his fellows to lead him implicitly into all those extravagances under which the character of his youth suffer'd and yet so it would go near to be suspected if his highness should now act towards them with an illtimed severity My lordchiefjustice hath therefore retracted his hasty orders for their imprisonment  Fri  Son well observed and I commend his lordship's prudence in treating their vices as infirmities and will readily undertake to commune with them on the grievous enormity of their dissolute lives  Offic  His lordship would have you apply first to Sir John Falstaff the ringleader of this vicious troop If you can dispose him to good the rest may follow  Fri  I will attend these reprobates and use the means  Offic  His lordship requires that you would bring Falstaff over to retire to a monastery if possible that being concealed from the eyes of the world he may not daily remind it of what is past Farewel good father I will see thee again at the Priory  Exit officer  SCENE III Street continued  FRIAR solus  I will go but I fear my mission will prove as fruitless as that of many other Apostles sent among Infidels As there is no danger of martyrdom however I am contentPersuade Sir John Falstaff to turn monk could I work miracles indeed and like St Thomas turn an Ethiop white something might be said for it bur as it is I despair of converting an old deboshee from two such prevailing heresies as the whore and the bottle  Exit  SCENE IV Tavern in Eastcheap  Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH  Fal  Two found naps of eight hours apiece have something recruited me Bardolph my morning's whet Is it prepar'd  Bar  'Tis here Sir John  Gives  Falstaff  a tankard  Fal  Here's to our better fortune  Drinks  Bar  Ah Sir John I am afeard our fortune hath been at its highest stood We have seen our best days  Fal  So the world goes Bardolph Up and down But is it not hard now I that havebut that's nothing I hate boasting It is however well known what pains I have taken to make a man of that Hal Nay you yourself are privy to many the good offices I have done him Before the younker knew me he could not drink sack made conscience of going to church on holidays and blush'd like a scarlet cloak at entering a bawdyhouse I  nstructed him in all the manly exercises I was content to win his money to teach him gaming to get drunk myself  o try to make him so Nay setting rotten limbs and dignity aside have I not even pimp'd for the bashful rogue  Such a prince of Wales by my troth I was asham'd of him Had it not been for me the milksop might have been crown'd before he had lost his maidenhead  Bar  And that would have been a pity Sir John to be sure  Fal  It was I first taught him to waylay the trueman for I knew him when he durst not cry  stand  to a turkeycock nay a gander of the ordinary size of a greengoose had it met him on a common would have made him run for it I went farther yet and not only embolden'd his actions but taught him the manly arts of conversation In the stile military for instance or swearing  Bar  Sir John I believe there you forget yourself the prince wanted no assistance of you in that for when he was a little crack he would swear ye as well as a man six foot high  Fal  Right Bardolph you are right I remember me swearing indeed he knew for tho' but a king's son he would as thou say'st rap out an oath like an emperor But then for the quintessence of all elocution the use of the hyperbole vulgarly call'd lying there I am a master yet what a deal of pains it hath cost me to teach Hal to lie▪ and all thrown away upon him He would never do it roundly He had no genius that way  Bar  You know Sir John the prince never could away with lying He us'd to say 'twas beneath a gentleman and a soldier  Fal  Well well he will never shine in the recital of his own exploits as Xenophon Caesar and I have done  Bar  Why Sir John to be sure you have done something  Fal  Something the services I have done him and his father are out of number Methinks my behaviour in the ever memorable action at Shrewsbury should make him blush at his ingratitude Who kill'd Hotspur Did not I give him his death's wound in the thigh Was i  not I who took prisoner that fiery dragon Coleville and that even alive And am I thus requited Is this the  guerdon of my great atchievements Hang valour I'll hack my sword no more▪ Thus has it ever been the fate of merit to be rewarded Alcibiades and Bellisarius for that  Bar  Ay Sir John they were tall fellows they were sadly us'd indeed I have heard of them But that was in king John's time I think  Fal  They were the Falstaffs of antiquity Bardolph  Bar  Like enough Sir John they were before my time to be sure though Pistol told me t'other day that general Bellisarius was his god father  Fal  Pistol is an ignorant braggard an ass I have injur'd my dignity by associating with rascals not worthy to wait at my heels What tell'st thou me of Pistol  Bar  Nay Sir John I meant no harm I do think you deserve to be made a lord of indeed  Fal  I expected nothing less I can assure ye And then for my wellknown oeconomy to have had the sole management of the exchequer at least  Bar  And instead of that to be banish'd  Fal  I know not if I heard the word banish I was forbidden indeed to come near the king's person by ten miles but I was not at that distance when those injunctions were laid on me Quere now it might pose a casuist let me tell ye whether I am thereby injoin'd to march right out ten miles an end whether the negative  not come  amounts to the positive  go  I will not understand it so and if that be my lord ch  ef justice's construction by the Lord I will put him to the trouble of carrying of me I will be la  d up with the gout ere I budge a foot  Bar  Indeed Sir John the king did say banish  Fal  Admit it unless he means to reside for ever in a place and be in his own proper person as immoveable as a church I hold my life on a damn'd precarious tenure He must give me timely notice of his motions that I may regulate mine accordingly otherwise if he be travelling my way we may happen to encounter and I get myself hang'd through inadvertency I do not think it safe therefore to stir out of town without more explicit orders Give me another draught  Bar  The tankard is out Sir John Shall I replenish  Fal  No I'll toward St Paul's a gentle perambulation this morning may refresh me  Exeunt  SCENE V A Street  Enter Justice SHALLOW Master SLENDER and a LAWYER  Shal  Well master Pleadwell are you still of that opinion If so my money's gone  Law  Indeed I am still of that opinion justice Shallow  Shal  What how that my money's gone  Law  Nay I know not that I say I am of opinion you should have taken a bond or obligation at the time of lending it friend Shallow A thousand pound on the bare word of a courtier and that courtier Sir John Falstaff ne'er an alderman in the city of London would have lent a thousand pence on such security  Slen  Oh that ever a country 'squire should have less wit than a city alderman  Law  A thousand pound Mr Shallow is  Shal  A thousand pound I know it is master Pleadwell I know it well But pray now is there no method in the law to recover it He cannot have spent it yet cannot we compel him to restitution Arrest himarrest him Mr Pleadwell  Law  But should he deny the debt how will you prove it and who knows on such an emergency what Sir John Falstaff will not do  Shal  Nay he will lye that's the truth on't  Slen  Ay Coz and that most consumedly too  Shal  I can prove his receipt of the money  Law  But the conditions justice ShallowWhat have you to shew that he is engag'd to return it and when  Shal  Nothing I was weak enough to lend it him on his bare word  Slen  Nay cousin Shallow not so neither I'll be sworn he borrow'd it upon his oath He swore upon the honour of a true knight to give him a thousand pound again and besides that the comingsin of a better thing in his majesty's court at London  Law  Ah Master Slender these knights have just honour enough to swear by but for any thing further I am apprehensive we shall find him one of those honourable knights whose word is as good as their oath But see if I mistake not yonder he comes this encounter may perhaps save us the trouble of attending him at home Let us speak him fair and persuade him if possible to sign an obligation for the money If we can do that we may trounce him Let me alone with him  Slen  O would you could Mr Pleadwell what would I give methinks to see him well trounc'd if it was only for giving me once a bloody coxcomb  SCENE VI Street continued  Enter FALSTAFF  Fal  How Master Shallow consulting with his lawyer are ye thereabouts friend Shallow would you hamper me with an action  Aside  I will pass them by  Going  Shal  Sir John Sir John a word with you if you please  Fal  O my good friends Robert Shallow  Esq  and Master Slender how fare ye gentlemen both  Law  Sir John Mr Shallow here has  Fal  Ha what mine old acquaintance Master Wheedlepoint how is it with your health Master Wheedlepoint  Law  Pleadwell is my name Sir John  Fal  RightI cry you mercyRoundabout Pleadwell think My memory is not so retentive as  Law  No offence Sir John that is not the case  Fal  Marry but it is Mr Pleadwell a treacherous memory is my great defect and a misnomer in law thou knowest  Law  Would be matter of consequence Sir John But that is not our business at present Mr Shallow here hath put a case  Fal  Ay Master Shallow should know something of the law too Was not he at Clement's inn when thou wert first enter'd there That must be many years ago Mr PleadwellLet me see How many years ago must that be Master ShallowWhy you carry your age well Mr Pleadwell  Shal  Pretty well pretty well Sir John but that  Fal  Nay marry I say very well Master Shallow And pray what is become of young Puzzlecause and Dick Silvertongue your fellowstudents there they were call'd to the bar I suppose That Dick was a prateapace rogue and a devil among the bona robas He and Master Shallow here were two with the wenches Ha Master Shallow  Shal  No matter Sir John at present we would confer on other business  Fal  Nay gentlemen if ye are on business I crave your pardon and leave ye I am not used to be impertinent  Law  You are not going Sir John it is with you our business lies  Fal  Business with me  Shal  Yes about the thousand pound Sir John  Fal  What mean you Master Shallow  Shal  That you borrow'd of me Sir John  Slen  Yes Sir John the thousand pound you borrow'd of my cousin Shallow Sir John  Fal  Take me with ye gentlemen both let me understand ye You presented me indeed with a thousand pound to promote your interest at court Master Shallow and may depend on it if I can serve you  Shal  Fiddle faddle Sir John I expect my money again your interest at court is not worth a farthing  Fal  I cannot help that the more is my misfortune Mr Shallow you see my heart is good  Law  If so Sir John you will not refuse to give Mr Shallow something to shew for his money under your hand  Fal  How dost thou know that Mr Pleadwell I must consult my counsel in this case  Law  There is no need Sir John I will draw up a little instrument to which thou wilt set thy hand immediately  Fal  Not while I have a head Master Pleadwell I like not running hand over head in these matters By latter Lammas or St Falstaff's day I may perhaps bethink me  Law  I know of no saint of thy family in the kalendar Sir John  Fal  Well well there may be saints of a worse Our merit hath not stood in the way of promotion that's all and yet there are as many whoremasters there as lawyers I believe Bun I cannot tarry now to hold farther question with thee fatigued as I am and earnest to reach my lodgings yonder  Law  If thou wilt there sign the instrument Sir John we will attend you thither  Fal  Wilt thou it is a notorious bawdyhouse  Law  No matter Sir John  Fal  No matter sayst thou Is it then no matter for one of the grave sages of the law to be seen in a public bawdyhouse Lord Lord what will this world come to My conscience however is more tender I should be sorry to give such occasion of scandal  Law  Please you Sir John to be serious Let us rightly understand each other  Fal  With all my heart good Master Pleadwell then to be plain with you I find you do not know me You talk to me of restitution and conditions did'st thou ever know Sir John Falstaff make restitution on any conditions  And dost thou think me so unpractis'd a courtier as to return the perquisites of my calling because I am turn'd out or to restore the purchase of my goodwill because I am not likely to get in What take ye me for a younker a geck Go toyou cannot play upon meMaster Shallow rest you content your money is in good hands and if I do not spend it like a gentleman never trust me with a thousand pound again  Shal  Oh that I ever did trust such a caitiff  Law  But pray were these the conditions Mr Shallow Was you to be repaid by a place at court  Slen  To be sure Why what do you think Mr Pleadwell cousin Shallow was fool enough to lend a thousand pound for nothing Why I myself was to be made a great man too and that into the bargain  Shal  Cousin Slender speak in your turn I pray you  Law  Were these terms specified  Fal  Not indeed on parchment  signatum sigillatum  Mr Pleadwell A courtier's promise is not indeed very good in law But I can tell ye the posts I should have procur'd for these noble 'squires and by'r lady thou wilt say they would have been well occupied Having a little pique or so at my Lordchiefjustice and Mr Shallow here thinking himself qualified I promis'd him my interest for his worship's removal from the quorum to his lordship's place on the bench Was it not so Mr Shallow  Shal  Don't belye me Sir John don't cheat me of my money and laugh at me too Robert Shallow esquire will not put up with that  Fal  Then for Mr Slender here I purpos'd for his address and elocution to have got him appointed orator to the house of parliament or otherwise in consideration of his figure and magnanimity to have made him a staff officer or captain of horse at the least  Slen  Nay Sir John you did not tell me what but I expected some notable place I'll assure ye for I look upon myself plain 'squire as I stand here to be somebody  Shal  Coz coz you are an ass coz  Slen  Why why I didn't lend him the money I  Law  Justice Shallow this is a very simple affair I am sorry it is not in my power to serve you in it Sir John if you had either honour or honesty you would restore the money but as you make pretensions to neither I leave you  Exit  Lawyer  SCENE VII Street continued  FALSTAFF SHALLOW and SLENDER  Fal  Well my masters you hear the counsel learned in the law Will you to dinner with me You shall see I am no niggard If you will lodge with me in Eastcheap you shall see the thousand pound fairly spent in sack you shall share with me to the utmost farthing But for dry restitution I have not been accustom'd to it of many years You would not have me a changeling at this time of day I hope Master Shallow  Shal  Changeling no Sir John thou art no changeling but depend on it I will not put up this wrong Robert Shallow  esq  will neither eat nor drink with thee If the law will not help me I will take other methods I will have my money depend on't I will have my money  Exit  Shallow  Slen  Ay ay we shall find means to get the money ever fear  Exit  Slender  SCENE VIII Street continued  FALSTAFF solus  Nay I fear it notat least before I shall have found  ans to spend it and then get it who may it concerns  t me We shall see however whose business will be  done first Mine will go merrily forward Ah shallow Master Shallow But who could have thought the snipe would have went to counsel to get himself laugh'd at Then to see how demurely Sir Slyboots angled for me as if I had been a gudgeon How cunningly the rascally barrador would have hook'd me on his instrument But I was even with the methodical knaveMy friend Shallow will never bring it to bear an action at law and if he should I am on the right side of the hedge Indeed were I to go to law for a mint of money I would chuse to have it all in my possession There is nothing like it Possession is the very life's blood of a bad cause on the strength of which in mine I will home to dinner  SCENE IX A fencing school  Enter PISTOL and NYM disguised  Pistol  Is this not better

FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH  Fal  BARDOLPH How is it with Peto to day  Bar  Why he's in a bad way Sir John  Fal  That allwhen was he otherwise who ever knew Peto or thee in a good way  Bar  And yet Sir John we are your followers you know  Fal  Well said BardolphI see thy wit is improv'd I lead you the way it is true but you follow me like spaniels with damnable circumvolutions But whom have we here  Bar  It is the doctor Sir John that has been up to see Peto  Fal  O doctor Caius Mithridate the apothecary a precious limb of GalenAt Windsor he was a physician and starved by prescribing poisons but now he is turned apothecary and thrives by administering them  SCENE II  Enter Dr CSIUS  Fal  So master Doctor thou art a man of merit I seeThou art sought afterPray how many patients may'st thou have

him must be a bad one to somebody A man of any conscience or humanity knows not how to salute fellows of such an occupation for who would wish the rest of mankind lame and blind sick and sorry to find them employment forsoothPoor Peto I would not lose him methinks for tho' he be a worthless knave he is an old acquaintance and I never could find in my heart to part with my old acquaintance merely because they were good for nothing King Hal is another sort of a man to what I am to abandon his old friends in his prosperity thus Poor Peto  Bar  Ecod Sir John it happen'd lucky for me I can tell ye that I came off so well as I did yesterday  Fal  Ay by'r lady thou playd'st fair to get off in a whole skin and leave thy friend and master in extremity  Bar  Nay 'pon honour Sir John I did my utmost  to keep up with you but 'twas unpossible and indeed it was very fortunable that I was not myself trod to death by the populous  Fal  Thou tell me the moon is a Suffolk cheese or a Windser pear Thou have I not seen thee clear the ring without a staff at a bearbaiting Thou might'st make thy way through a legion nay the millions of a croisade why who would come within a fathom of that firebrand thy nose It is a flaming twoedged sword Wouldst thou make me believe the villains would come near thee to burn their holiday cloaths Thou wouldst have set them ablaz'ng like stubble and have consumed the whole procession of heralds like men of straw A plague upon them it was by their avoiding thee I suppose that I had like to have died a martyr to corpulency  Bar  Sir John you are always plaguing me about my face what would you have me do with it  Fal  Do with it If there were water enough in the Thames I would have thee quench it But water I fear can do nothing for thee since I remember when we rode last from Canterbury when the rain beating full in our faces thou cam'st into the Borough with thy nose and cheeks glowing redhot although they had been hissing all the way like a tailor's goose God forgive mebut when thou runn'st behind the hedge in fear of the officer I could not help comparing him and thee to Moses and the burningbush But thou wilt in time be consumed thy fire must out  Bar  I would it were out so be I might hear no more on't In troth Sir John if I must always be your butt I shall seek another service I assure you  Fal  Nay nay good Bardolph that must not be I speak not in disparagement heav'n knows for I mean to cherish thee against the lack of fuel or the visitation of a Dutch winter  Bar  'Sblood Sir John I'll bear it no longer  Going  Fal  Hold Bardolph where art thou going thou  glowworm in magnature with thy tail upwards thou pumpionheaded rascal stay or  Bar  Give me good words then Sir John Why pumkin head pray now  Fal  Hast thou never seen a scoop'd pumpion set over a candle'send on a gate post to frighten ale wives from gossiping by owllight That is a type of theethat is thy emblem thy head being hollow full of light and easily broken as thou shalt experience if thou offer'st to fly thy colours till disbanded by authority I shall need thee I tell thee to keep me warm under the coldness of the king's displeasure  Bar  Indeed Sir John burnt sack and ginger will do you more good for whatsomever light I may give I am fare set aside choler I am as cold as e'er a whiteliver'd younker in town  Fal  Cold sayst thou thy face would condemn thee for an incendiary before any bench of judicature in the kingdom thou wouldst carry apparent combustibles into court with thee Tell not me of cold Thou wouldst certainly have been hang'd long ago had not the sheriff been afraid thou wouldst have fir'd the hangman or the gibbet  Bar  Why Sir John I have been your attendant off and on these twenty years come Candlemas and I don't find I have had any such effect on you  Fal  The cause you rogue the cause am not I oblig'd to keep a pipe of Canary constantly discharging on me Are not the tapsters perpetually employed the sackbuckets for ever a going to keep me from blazing And yet at times my skin is shrivell'd up like an April pippin Mark me but walking an hundred paces with thee glowing at my heels if I do not broil and drip like a roasting ox  Bar  Ah you are pleased to be hard upon me Sir John but I am sure my face never hurt a hair of your head  Fal  No look at 'emhath it not turn'd them all  grey Twenty years ago before they were calcin'd by thy fire my locks were of a nutbrown  Bar  Why you grow old Sir John  Fal  Old what call ye old I am a little more than threescore and Methusalem liv'd to near a thousand Why may not I be a patriarch and beget sons and daughters these hundred years myself  Bar  Then you must get a wife Sir John for your common fields you know never bear clover  Fal  Marry what to be made a cuckold of I warrant ye  Bar  Why Sir John if you should marry you would not like to be singular I suppose  Fal  Nay for the matter of that all's one but who will have me Your dames of breeding are too fine and finicking tor me to bear with them  Bar  Ay or for them to bear you either Sir John  Fal  Nay whoever has me she must be no tenderling she must be none of your gingerbread lasses that will crumble to pieces in the towzling She must be none of your wishywashy panada gentry neither your curd and whey gentlefolks that cannot support the embraces of a soldier I must have a kicksywicksey of more substantial stuff  Bar  Why Sir John what say you to Madam Ursula your old sweetheart You have courted her to my knowledge these twenty years last past I suppose you know her great aunt is dead and has left her four hundred marks a year  Fal  No by the lord I heard nothing on't She sent me a letter indeed into Gloucestershire but I was over a bottle and would not interrupt the glass to read it I knew it was hers by the superscription which by the way however was as unintelligible as the handwriting on the wall It had never reached me had not the bearer been a decypherer Go Bardolph and fetch it you will find it among other trumpery in my cloak bag  Exit Bardolph  SCENE IV Tavern continued  FALSTAFF solus  Four hundred marks a year quoth he It were not an unreasonable competence were not sherries comparatively so dear But if the female incumbrance on it should turn out a shrew the Lord have mercy on me in thus paying off the sins of my youth Let me bethink me Four hundred marks a year I have it is true small hopes from Hal and shall grow old some time or other These aches in my limbs forebode it I cannot hold out for ever that's certain Were it not good therefore to make a virtue of necessiry and take up while I am in case to reap the credit of reformation Could I reconcile it to my interest I believe my inclination would follow  SCENE V Tavern continued  Reenter BARDOLPH  Bar

it  Reads on  HumhumRepayment of the money  or the performance of my engagements Hoo am I then to be married on compulsion That will go most damnably against the grain But holdif I marry her money will be mine if nor she may cease to lend when she pleases and the fortune of that man is always at the turning of the tide who depends on the caprice of a woman  Bar  Why marry her then Sir John I dare say she has heard nothing of your disgrace at court so that she won't stand upon terms  Fal  Marry Bardolph and I am half resolved to do so Yea by the Lord and I will too She has besides two thousand pounds in money I will courageously make the attack and mount the breach of matrimony If I sall into the hands of Philistines why good night It is but going into purgatory a few years before

sincere  Brid  A sure sign you lov'd him madam  Urs  And yet to be sure before I receiv'd his letter I thought I never should hear from him again and had almost come to a resolution to cast him entirely off  Brid  In good sooth madam that is very prudent to cast off a lover when we find he will leave us  Urs  I think so and not a little imprudent to do it before for one of my years at least  Brid  Why madam you are not so old  Urs  Indeed but I amold enough to know I ought not to part with one lover till I am sure of another  Brid  To be sure madam a bird in the hand is worth two in the

Sir John God save ye  Fal  Thank thee good father What is your reverence's will  Fr  I think thou dost not know me Sir John It is indeed many years since our personal intimacy your way of life and mine  Fal  Were something different father to be sure and tho' I may have seen you before it is so long since I have been at shrift that I must crave your pardon if I have totally forgot you And yet your reverence may be ray ghostly father for ought I know  Fr  Fy fy Sir John a man of your age and gravity  Fal  Hoh if your business be to chide me I shut mine cars  Fr  If you will not admit your wound to be prob'd how can you expect to be cured Sir John  Fal  Cur'd 'sblood I took thee for a priest and I find thou art a surgeon  Fr  A spiritual one Sir John and such as your disorder requires  Fal  Dost thou know my case then A spiritual surgeon sayst thou I am not given over by the surgeons bodily yet Who call in the divine till they have sent out the doctor  Fr  I know your case well Sir John It is perhaps less your body than your mind that is infected  Fal  Nay like enough I have indeed been damnably dispirited ever since the king's coronation A confounded melancholy hangs upon me like a quotidian ague  Fr  It is that melancholy and the cause of it Sir John I would remove  Fal  And how wouldst thou remove it By providing  me with a charge of horse and restoring me to the king's favour I know no other way  Fr  By inducing thee to repent and be restor'd to the favour of the King of kings which thou hast forfeited by a dissolute and abandoned life Dost thou not think thou art in a state of reprobation  Fal  Pray friar by what authority dost thou take upon thee to catechise me Dost thou come out of mere charity or art thou employ'd by thy superiors  Fr  Suppose the former Sir John  Fal  Suppose the former father friar why then the devil is so strong in me that I should be tempted to throw thee headlong down stairs for thy charitable impertinence  Fr  Thy illmanners Sir John would be inexcusable were it not to be supposed the consequence of an habitual antipathy to every thing that is good But I will not lay claim to greater merit than is my due I am come by order of my Lordchiefjustice who is so much your friend as to interest himself in your reformation  Fal  My Lordchiefjustice that's another matter I cry thee mercy reverend father I find thou'rt not the man I took thee for Your reverence does me honour and I profess I am much indebted to his lordship's kind love and regard to my soul's health  Fr  You'll hear me then Sir John  Fal  Yea heav'n forbid I should notwhat I said was meant against those officious zealots who are so forward to pry into men's consciences that will not bear the looking into  Fr  Sir John we know your failings and shall not put you to the trouble of auricular confession at present  Fal  There friar thou winn'st my heart Come sit thee down Wilt drink a glass of sack  Fr  I never do Sir John  Fal  I cry thee mercy then Here is to your reverence's health and now I'll tell thee whatI do protest I sit me now upon the stool of repentance and have been honestly deliberating some time past to change my course  of life I am heartily tir'd of it Indeed I am good father  Fr  I am glad to find thee in such promising dispositions and think thou couldst not do better than to betake thyself agreeable to his lordship's intentions to some monastery where thou wilt be secluded from temptations and have all spiritual assistance to encourage thee to mortify the desires of the flesh  Fal  Hold thee there good father Let me understand thee What would his lordship make a monk of me I must there beg his pardon A monk and to mortify the flesh For heav'ns sake good father consider what a mortification indeed that must be to me who have fix times the quantity of any other man If I must be included within the pale of the church why not make a canon of me not indeed a minor canon but a prebendary or a bishop now Something might be said for either of these But for a monk I know not any thing I am less fit for unless indeed his lordship had meant to make a running footman of me  Fr  Nay Sir John his lordship will not use compulsion in this He will not so far lay a restraint on your inclinations  Fal  O if I ever find myself that way inclin'd his lordship may depend on it I shall be as ready as ever to follow my inclinations But the lesson of lean and sallow abstinence is very long and hard good father I am not gotten halfway through the first chapter yet  Fr  Some steps however Sir John you must take toward a more reputable way of life and that speedily too otherwise you will be stript of the honours of knighthood and the king's sentence of banishment will be strictly put into execution against you  Fal  As to the matter of knighthood once a knight and always a knight you know The king may make as many knights as he pleases but he will not so easily unmake them again My title will not depend on the king's courtesy but on that of my followers I am notwithstanding very desirous to give his lordship satisfaction  and do assure thee on the honour of a soldier of the sincerity of my repentance  Fr  And yet this may be only a transitory fit of penitence owing to your late disappointment What reason canst thou give me to hope this state of mind will continue  Fal  Why father what I am shortly going to do is an act that has confin'd many a man to a state of repentance which hath continued to the last hour of his life  Fr  This Sir John is saying something Pray what are you going to do  Fal  I have taken a resolution father toWhat dost thou think now it is I have resolv'd upon  Fr  Some commendable act of penance no doubt  Fal  Nay it may well be call'd so I believe I am determin'd good father to marry  Fr  Call you that an act of penance Sir John Is marriage a state of mortification  Fal  I wish I may not find it so  Fr  Well Sir John marriage is a holy state and in some degree I approve your resolution but in the estimation of the church it is also an holy act and ought not to be enter'd into unadvisedly Your repentance should precede your receiving the benefit of that sacrament  Fal  O doubt not but I shall repent me sufficiently afterwards  Fr  Ah Sir John Sir John I fear me you are no true penitent but however it may be lawful to salve what cannot be effectually cur'd I did not expect to make a convert at the first interview If thou takest any measures that tend toward reformation thou shalt have my prayers and best assistance therein Another time I will hold farther conversation with thee  Fal  In the mean time good father let me stand fair in your report to my Lordchiefjustice and his majesty  Fr  Thou shalt stand fairer than I fear thou deservest Farewel  Exit  Friar  SCENE V Tavern continued  FALSTAFF solus  Fare thee well good father friar What an hypocritical puritan Would not drink sack Not with the ungodly I suppose But I am damnably mistaken if he be not indebted for that rosy countenance and the gout to the penetrating qualities of old sherris  SCENE VI  Enter BARDODPH  Fal  Well Bardolph what news dost thou bring  Bar

and master Slender For my own part I'm out of the plot but if I find the contrivance is deep the 'squires are caught Pistol and Nym are somehow at the bottom of it That's all I can learn  Fal

villainous machinations of these runagates Bur now attend me forth  Excunt  SCENE VII  Enter URSULA and BRIDGET  Urs  Now Bridget mark me well That errant knave Our Spanish suitor will anon be here

familiarity with so little grace as Majesty hath done I do invite ye all therefore to supper with me And if you cannot laugh over the success of your own contrivances be merry on the consummation of my nuptials  Come spouse tho' long indeed hath been our courting  We're not quite past the days of love and sporting  'Tis true a younger bridegroom had you sped  He might have been less prone to sleep in bed  Yet ev'n in autumn some spring flowers may grow  As there are lillies in September blow  Youth's wild oats sown 'tis ne'er too late to mend  The worst once past the better is the end  The END  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs PRITCHARD  Enters reading a Card  THE muse of Shakespeare's complimentsA card  T'excuse this evening's enterprizing Bard  Great his presumption to confess the truth  But as he pleads the passion of his youth  Together with the magick of her charms  Attracting him resistless to her arms  Tho' somewhat by surprize she owns she suffer'd  Yet as no actual violence was offer'd  She's willing if the audience should agree  For this one time to set th'offender free  We women soon forgive if not forget  The crimes our beauties make the men commit  Especially when once we're past our prime  And Shakespeare's muse like me's the worse for time  For tho' she charm with fancy ever young  Tho' heav'nly musick dwell upon her tongue  Lost many an artless smile and dimple sleek  Which sat alluring on her virgin cheek  Beauties that faded on the gazer's eye  And no coldcream of comment can supply  As for what Merc'ry in the Prologue told ye  Pray let not that from clemency withhold ye  That Hermes was of old a lying blade  And practic'd in imposture as his trade  The patron he or classic lore deceives  Of cheats forestallers higglers hucksters thieves  Besidesto tell you a stagetrick of ours  But you'll not spread the secret out of doors  The man was no more Mercury than I am  Queen Hecuba the wife of Trojan Priam  A messenger from Phoebus He a god  I can assure you all 'twas Mr Dodd  His dropping from the clouds was all a sham  And his pretended errand but a flam  We've heathen gods of pasteboard made to fly  On hempen cords across the painted sky  Those canvass clouds that dangle there above  Inveloping the throne itself of love  His tale fictitious too tho' told so glib  For take it on my word 'twas all a fib  Old Falstaff in ElysiumTo my thinking  So great his natural tendency to sinking  That to the shades if he had once descended  To bring him back not Atlas had pretended  Dramatic sprites at least they tell me so  Dwell not with saints above nor devils below  But form'd th' imagination to engage  During their shortliv'd passage o'er the stage  As mere ideal characters exist  And stand as cyphers mark'd on Nature's list  To genius giv'n a delegated power  To form these transient beings of an hour  Which from this mimic world whene'er they go  Are free to range in fancy's pimlico  A limbo large and broad which in the schools  Is call'd by some the Paradise of Fools  Feroe naturoe  THERE their preservation  Is purchas'd by no game association  The poaching plagiary alone denied  A priviege granted to each bard beside  Who tho' a cottager to try his skill  May shoot or course or hunt them down at will  In his own paddock may the strays receive  And scorn to ask a lordly owner's leave  Not but that  bere  the Author of the play  By me begs leave submissively to say  "None more than he reveres great Shakespear's name  "Or glows with zeal to vindicate his same"
