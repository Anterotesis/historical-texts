 A SHORT TREATISE ON THE ENGLISH TONGUE  A SHORT TREATISE ON THE ENGLISH TONGUE  Being an Attempt to render the Reading and Pronunciation OF THE SAME More EASY to FOREIGNERS  LONDON Printed for R HORSFIELD in Ludgate Street and I ALLIX in Glanville Street Rathbone Place  MDCCLXVII  INTRODUCTION  IT is generally allowed that the most easy method of attaining any living language is to associate and converse with those who speak it Nevertheless when a foreigner has by this means so far acquired the English tongue that he shall be able to speak it and under∣stand it when spoken tolerably well he will yet find himself greatly at a loss when he at∣tempts to read because the manner of ex∣pressing sounds by letters in his own language is so very different from ours that many English words which he is well acquainted with by ear will not appear to him to be the same when he sees them in writingFor not only various sounds are expressed in the English language by the same vowels but also in many particular words a kind of ar∣bitrary  pronunciation is used which cannot easily be reduced to rule and is therefore most commonly taught merely by ear or imi∣tation  This latter difficulty I am afraid cannot be removed but I think it may be relieved in some degree by separating all such words from those which are capable of being taught by rule This I have attempted and have accordingly collected all or the greatest part of such kind of words under their proper heads as exceptions to the several rules given in the following pages together with a short explanation of their soundBy this means a learner may have his task before him and may easily refer to any particular word as he shall have occasion which will greatly relieve his memory  I have not taken notice of all the deriva∣tives and compounds which properly belong to the several exceptions but for the most part of primitive words only for the sake of brevity which I hope will be thought suffi∣cient  the others being naturally comprehend∣ed therein Many words indeed are varied according to the different position of the ac∣cent which not only shortens the articula∣tion of the succeeding syllables but in some words causes them to be so indistinctly pro∣nounced that it is sometimes difficult to de∣termine what vowels are sounded therein yet if the learner is but careful to give the ac∣cented syllable its proper pronunciation ac∣cording to the following rules he will natu∣rally fall into the customary utterance of the other syllables which as they are pronounced quick need not be studied so particularly  The rules treat only of the general power of the vowels and diphthongs because in these consist the most material differences between the English pronunciation and that of foreign∣ers but I have added thereto by way of ap∣pendix a short treatise drawn up and com∣municated by a friend for the explanation of such particularities also of the other letters as are peculiar to the English tongue  All which together I flatter myself will be sufficient to enable a foreigner to read and pronounce any English words with ease and certainty when the syllables of the same are properly divided according to the learned Dr Lowth's excellent rule for spelling given in the th page of his English grammar viz  The best and  only sure rule  for dividing the syllables in spelling is to divide them as they are naturally divided in a right pronunciation without regard to the deri∣vation of words or the possible combina∣tion of consonants at the beginning of a syllable  Mr John Gignoux likewise particularly re∣commends and explains this method in the preface to his spellingbook intituled  The Child's best Instructor in Spelling and Read∣ing  A title which it seems well to de∣serve on account of the division of the seve∣ral syllables according to the manner abovementioned by which it is rendered in my opinion at least the most useful book of the sort that has hitherto been published  I must however observe that the author in his  Table of Words written very different from their Pronunciation  at page has too much followed the common London pro∣nunciation which tho' perhaps in general the best yet has some very exceptionable particu∣larities Among which are  Potticary  for Apo∣thecary  Athist  for Atheist  Awkurd  for Auk∣ward  Riccolas  for Auricolas  Belcony  for Balcony  Carrin  for Carrion  Sirket  for Cir∣cuit  Crowner  for Coroner  Gorjus  for Gor∣geous  Hankerchur  for  Handkerchief I'urn  for Iron  Ilan  for Island  Spanel  for Spaniel  Stum∣much  for Stomach  Sound  for Swoon  Thusty  for Thirsty  Vawt  for Vault  Venzun  for Veni∣son  Verdit  for Verdict c  Also in page he signifies that the termi∣nations  tial cial cian tious cious tient  and  cient  make each of them  but one sound or syllable  But however common such pro∣nunciation may be it ought not by any means to be taught or laid down as a rule because the English language loses much of its ele∣gance  when it is expressed in so careless a manner that any of the abovementioned ter∣minations shall seem but one syllable  The  i  in all these terminations has the sound of the English  e  and though it is pronounced quick yet it ought to be distinctly expressed as in  Partial Social Grecian Captious Gracious Quotient Ancient  c There fore I hope that the author in his next edi∣tion of that useful book will make some al∣teration in his explanation of these particu∣lars  Others besides Mr Gignoux have been misled by the indistinct manner in which some particular syllables are sometimes uttered even by good speakers Mr James Buchanan in particular has given himself much unneces∣sary trouble and has carried his refinements a great deal too far concerning syllables of this kind which in quick pronunciation have seemed to him to partake of an articulation different from the real spelling This has un∣fortunately not only added great difficulty to  his  An Essay towards establishing a Standard for an ele∣gant and uniform Pronunciation of the English Language as practised by the most learned and polite Speakers  performance but rendered it almost in∣capable of answering the good purposes in∣tended by it For he has frequently substi∣tuted an imaginary articulation of one vowel for the inarticulation or rather the short and indistinct sound of another not considering that the expressing of an accented syllable in many particular words does almost unavoid∣ably cause the succeeding syllable or syllables to be so indistinctly pronounced that it is sometimes difficult to determine what vowels are sounded therein as I have before ob∣served  But when words are so pronounced that in∣stead of the short or indistinct sound of one vowel a manifest articulation of another dif∣ferent vowel may be distinguished it then be∣comes a fault in speech which howsoever common it may be ought by no means to be  imitated much less taught because the ge∣nerality of people are naturally too liable of themselves to acquire it without being led thereto by written instructions  The following examples taken from Mr Buchanan's book will illustrate what has been said viz He has substituted ĭl for the ter∣minations al ial and el as  Năivĭl Neu∣trĭl Kŏmĭk  l Joodeĕshĭl Spĕshĭl Quărĭl  c for Naval Neutral Comical Judicial Spe∣cial Quarrel c  Mr Peyton's  "New Vocabulary or Grammar of the true pronunciation of the English"  is not less liable to cen∣sure for the same words are there rendered Naivel Ni  u  trel djŏudĭchiel Spechiel Couârril c  in  for an as  Heumin Orgĭn  c for Human Organ c  ĭnss  for ance and ence and  ĭnt  for ant and ent as  Abundinss Rĕvĕrinss Contentmĭnt Com∣mandmint  c instead of Abundance Re∣verence Contentment Commandment c  fŏol  for ful as  Faithfoŏl  c  iss  for ess as  Heedlĭss Hăppĭnĭss  and a great abundance of such other syllables equally distant from the true pronunciation  As I have no other motive for giving my opinion so freely concerning this gentleman's performance than the desire of removing all unnecessary difficulty from the learning of English I hope he will excuse me even though my remarks should not have sufficient weight to convince him  He may likewise assure himself that though I think an uniformity of pronunciation through∣out the British dominions is more to be wished than hoped for yet I should have as much real satisfaction as himself in the completion of that  "great moral end"  which as he sup∣poses in his preface would be promoted thereby viz the removal of  national preju∣dice  an effect equally to be desired by all lovers of their country whether South or North Britons  It would be much to the advantage of all those who learn the English tongue if the  syllables in all future editions of English dic∣tionaries were divided according to the  A very useful little dictionary on this plan was printed in for J Nourse and S Hooper in the Strand intituled "the Complete English Spelling Dictionary upon an entire new Plan" the author Mr J Carter  me∣thod recommended by Dr Lowth and Mr Gignoux before mentioned and likewise if the words which are not properly English were distinguished by an asterisk or some other par∣ticular mark placed before them that foreign∣ers may not conceive our language to be un∣necessarily copious and difficult  The coining of new words from other lan∣guages to express any thing which might as concisely and elegantly be explained in proper English words is a kind of pedantry which all writers should endeavour to avoid unless we be allowed to except those who treat of na∣tural philosophy medicine surgery or such other subjects as are supposed to be read by none but those who are acquainted with other languages or at least have some knowledge of  the Latin tongue For it ought to be the study of every writer to make his meaning as plain and intelligible in the proper language in which he writes as he possibly can Yet so many of our most eminent writers have oc∣casionally been guilty of the fault above men∣tioned that the ingenious Mr Johnson has thought himself obliged to insert a great abun∣dance of such coined words into his excellent English dictionary and the reverend Mr Entick likewise into his very useful new pocket dictionary But I cannot suppose that such kind of words were admitted by these gen∣tlemen as proper English words but merely that they might explain them to English rea∣ders who without the knowledge of other languages cannot otherwise possibly understand them which is a sufficient proof that they are not at all intitled to the name of English words  For how should an English reader I mean a reader merely of English be supposed to under∣stand that  Ablepsy  signifies blindness  Acetosity  sourness  Anhelation  panting  Arcanum  a  secret  Obesity  fatness  Papilio  a butterfly  Neoterick  modern  Paranymph  a brideman  Rugose  wrinkled  Squalor  nastiness  Terreous  earthy  Tenebricose  dark  Tripudiation  dancing  Tumefy  to swell  Turm  a troop and a thou∣sand other such words which are found in both dictionaries  It is much to be wished that all such new coined words which have only been used by a few authors were distinguished by some mark from the common and proper English words as I have hinted above in all future editions of these useful dictionaries lest so many un∣couth and pedantick expressions should be adopted into the English tongue by dictionary authority Because when a person sees them ranged with other words in an English dic∣tionary he may be induced to make use of them as proper English words in his writing and discourse which would at first cause no small impediment to the understanding of his ordinary readers and hearers  The accents used in these dictionaries are particularly useful for keeping up an uniformity in pronunciation and it would be well if the double accents were also added to some parti∣cular words as in Mr Gignoux's spelling book for the purpose mentioned in page of his preface viz To denote that  the consonant that begins the next syllable must be also sounded at the end of the syllable where the double accent is as a″tónement man″gle intan″gle which words must be sounded as if written attonement manggle intanggle  so in con″queror con″cubine c  The same would also be particularly useful in words wherein g and c are softened by the vowels e and i fol∣lowing them in the next syllable as in neglig″ent vorac″ity c  In my search for such words as are inde∣pendent of the following rules I made use of the Rev Mr Entick's new spelling dictionary and though I examined the same so carefully  that I believe I have not made many omissions yet the whole number of particular exceptions exclusive of their compounds and derivatives amount to no more than  There are indeed foreign words besides see page which are not included in this number because as they still retain their original pronunciation or nearly so they cannot properly be accounted exceptions to English rules  which number bears a very small proportion to the number of words in that dictionary which I compute to be upwards of This I think ought to prove that the English pronunciation is not so very irregular as it is generally thought to be which a careful examination of the fol∣lowing pages will more particularly shew  A SHORT TREATISE ON THE ENGLISH TONGUE  THE English vowels a e i o and u have each of them  The vowels may indeed be said to have more sounds than because a different pronunciation from the sounds here spoken of is given to each of the vowels in a few particular cases which are hereafter noted but at present I am only speaking of their general power    sounds  commonly called  long  and  short  The sounds of the three first vowels a e and i when long seem to be peculiar at present to this nation wherefore they may properly be called the English sounds  And the short sounds of these three vowels may for the sake of distinction be called the foreign sounds because they are uttered with scarcely any difference except that a and i are pronounced short from the French arti∣culation of the same vowels which shall be more fully explained by  See the examples to the d rule  examples here∣after  I think it necessary to observe in this place that the English sound of the following vowels diphthongs and terminations cannot easily be expressed in foreign letters and should there∣fore be learned by ear viz  i long  There are ways of sounding the long i and y though both long the one a little different from the other and requiring a little more extension of the mouth as may be seen by comparing the following words viz I and Aye High and Highho By't or by it and Bite Sigh'd and Side Strive and Strife c but this dif∣ference being so nice is not to be attained but by much practice neither is it very material  as in Bible Mitre Nitre Pirate c  o and u short before a consonant in the same syllable as in Odd Nod Lord c and in Mud Strut Stun Urn c  oi and oy which have both the same sound as in Oil Boil Coil Boy Coy Hoy c  ou and ow not like the French ou in the pronunciation of which the lips are almost closed but with an open articulation as in Pound Our Gown Power c  Also the following Terminations viz  ire  tion  cious  tious  as in Dire Fire Salvation Deli∣cious Fictitious c  The English
