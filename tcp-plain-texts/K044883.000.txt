PATERNOSTERROW MDCCXCI  TO THE MEMORY OF SAMUEL JOHNSON LL D  THE SUBLIME AND MORAL IMITATOR OF JUVENAL THE FOLLOWING POEM IS INSCRIBED BY A FRIEND WHO LOVED HIM LIVING WHO HONOURED HIS VIRTUES NO LESS THAN HIS GENIUS AND NOW ENDEAVOURS WITH UNEQUAL STEPS TO FOLLOW HIS BRIGHT EXAMPLE NON ITA CERTANDI CUPIDUS QUAM PROPTER AMOREM QUOD TE IMITARI AVEO  ARTHUR MURPHY  MAY  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Thirteenth Satire of Juvenal has been always admired by the ablest judges not merely for its elegance and poetical spirit but as a sublime composition containing the purest and most useful moral doctrine such as goes home to the breast and business of every man in society The Author launches out with his usual indignation against the reigning vices of the times and particularly FRAUD and PERJURY He introduces his subject with an apparent intention to console a friend who had deposited a sum of money in the hands of a man base enough to deny the trust and support his fraud by a daring Perjury  He observes in the outset that the guilty are never at peace they have no rest from their own relentless thoughts and yet deceit and treachery and injustice prevail in the mass of human life He paints forth the vices of mankind in glaring colours and having by way of contrast mentioned the times of innocence commonly called the Golden Age he takes occasion to place in a ridiculous light the whole system of the Heathen Mythology The wit and pleasantry with which this part of the poem is executed are truly beautiful but there is reason to fear that the whole passage would now be thought an unseasonable digression and for that reason it was judged advisable in the English Poem to substitute ideas drawn from modern manners  Juvenal proceeds to observe the intrepidity with which perjury is often committed The fear of detection  by human evidence he says is the only restraint secure from that danger the offender is ready as Shakespeare has it  to jump the life to come  Of this depravity two causes are assigned in the first place Atheism and secondly even among believers the delusive hope of escaping punishment or of expiating the sin by repentance at a future day The Poet after this exhibits a black list of crimes and in such a general corruption of manners exhorts his friend to appease resentment in his own particular case Revenge he says is a little passion He recurs to his first proposition namely that the Perjurer even though he may elude the hand of justice is sure to suffer the selfcondemning award of his own conscience He describes in bold relief the horrors of a guilty mind He traces the progress of vice beginning with a petty fraud and rushing on with apparent success till at length some foul enormity  calls down the sentence of the law and gives full proof to the world that a superintending Providence watches over the deeds of men and finally overtakes the offender with slow but certain vengeance  Such is the moral that inspires and animates the whole of Juvenal's admirable performance It may be called A POETICAL STATUTE OF FRAUDS AND PERJURIES A composition so truly valuable ought not to remain in the hands of the scholar only like a sword in the scabbard as Tully has it  tamquam in vaginâ reconditum  The doctrine should be impressed on every mind For this purpose the mode of imitation was thought more eligible than a direct and close translation Mr Pope had led the way and the late Doctor Johnson followed him with distinguished applause The fine use which he made of the Third and Tenth Satires of Juvenal in LONDON  a Poem and THE VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES is well known to every reader of taste In fact those two pieces are finished with such vigour of sentiment and such strength and harmony of language as may well preclude in the present writer all hope of competition It is to be regretted that so fine a Moral Poet did not employ a portion of his time upon the Satire now before us The author of the following lines endeavoured at various times to excite him to the undertaking but the answer always was "I WISH IT WAS DONE" The reader will no doubt wish the same and by the pen of DOCTOR JOHNSON To supply the deficiency is the design of the piece now offered to the public It is at least a well intended attempt and requires no apology  Seventeen Hundred and Ninety One  A POEM  IN IMITATION OF THE THIRTEENTH SATIRE OF JUVENAL  Exemplo quodcumque malo committitur ipsi  Displicet auctori prima haec est ultio quod se  Judice nemo nocens absolvitur improba quamvis  Gratia fallaci praetoris vicerit urnâ  YES it is true so nature's laws ordain  Guilt on its author still returns with pain  Conscience that awful judge of all mankind  Erects a dread tribunal in the mind  Nought there can warp the sense of wrong and right  No glossing advocate turns black to white  Though the pack'd jury set the culprit free  He stands convicted by his own decree  Bitter remembrance charges ev'ry sin  The worm that never dies corrodes within  Such the sad lot of guilt and you my friend  Though wrong'd have still this justice in the end  What though a perjur'd knave retain your pelf  His own tormentor still he goads himself  Casus multis his cognitus ac jam  Tritus et e medio fortunae ductus acervo  Ponamus nimios gemitus flagrantior aequo  Non debet dolor effe viri nec vulnere major  As fortune turns her giddy wheel around  Oft in life's lottery such blanks are found  Then rouse your strength and act on reason's plan  Feel your distress but feel it like a man  Of your misfortune fairly state th' account  Sum up the whole and what is the amount  You serv'd a friend and trusted him alone  Sacrum tibi quod non reddat amicus  Depositum  No witness near and he denies the loan  This chafes your spleen yet by experience form'd  Stupet haec qui jam post terga reliquit  Sexaginta annos Fonteio consule natus  Born ere brave Vernon Porto Bello storm'd  Can you near sixty summers roll'd away  Thus stand at gaze in wonder and dismay  Magna quidem sacris quae dat praecepta libellis  Victrix fortunae sapientia Dicimus autem  Hos quoque felices qui ferre incommoda vitae  Nec jactare jugum vitâ didicere magistrâ  Go to the stoic hear the ancient sage  And draw pure wisdom from the moral page  Wisdom that conquers pain and toil and strife  And tow'rs above the accidents of life  Go read mankind he fairly claims the prize  Who in that school finds leisure to be wise  Who sees the various ills that round him press  Smiles at the storm and triumphs in distress  Quae tam festa dies ut cesset prodere furem  Perfidiam fraudes atque omni ex crimine lucrum  Quaesitum et partos gladio vel pyxide nummos  What day so holy but it brings to light  The foul misdeeds and horrors of the night  The prowling highwayman no sabbath keeps  Whole droves to jail each trading justice sweeps  Read Newgate's Calendarwhat lists you find  Of frauds and villanies to plague mankind  The perjur'd caitiff who no God believes  Bawds swindlers murderers receivers thieves  By ev'ry crime the ruffian's treasures grow  By secret poison and th' assassin's blow  Life teems with ills where now the upright man  Go with your lantern find him if you can  Compute the muster of your valued file  Rari quippe boni numero vix sunt totidem quot  Thebarum portae vel divitis ostia Nili  Say does it equal the sev'n mouths of Nile  With care this habitable globe survey  And view the deeds done in the face of day  Nona aetas agitur pejoraque saecula ferri  Temporibus quorum sceleri non invenit ulla  Nomen et a nullo posuit natura metallo  Vice now surpasses with resistless rage  What poets fabled of their iron age  To mark the times within her inmost veins  No metal base enough the earth contains  Yet you at trifles struck with wild surprize  To rage and tumult bid your passions rise  And if his plighted faith a traitor break  You storm the world and bid Olympus shake  Nos hominum divumque fidem clamore ciemus  Quanto Fessidium laudat vocalis agentem  Sportula  Not with such noise when some new play appears  Bad poets and worse critics stun our ears  Not half so loud pit box and gall'ry roar  When the soft warbler prompts the dear ENCORE  Not half so loud the rabble strain their throats  When the chair'd member bows for venal votes  And must you still pour forth the plaintive strain  Reason will ask you have you liv'd in vain  Has time whose hand has silver'd o'er your head  Brought no experience no reflection bred  Dic senior bullâ dignissime nescis  Quas habeat veneres aliena pecunia nescis  Quem tua simplicitas vulgo risum moveat cum  Exigis a quoquam ne pejuret et putet ullis  Esse aliquod numen templis araeque rubenti  Greyheaded novice must you now be told  How strong th' allurement of another's gold  Go preach at Jonathan's your musty rule  Each broker there will hiss you for a fool  A fool to think when lucre is in view  That sacred truth can avarice subdue  Man now my friend man plays th' impostor's part  And calls on heav'n an atheist in his heart  Ev'n in the temple at the sacred shrine  He feels no sanctions of the will divine  Thinks there's no eye to pierce the perjur'd band  No God to grasp the thunder in his hand  Wouldst thou controul this epidemic rage  Then bid old time roll back the golden age  Or good King Alfred's reign once more renew  And give those days of glory to our view  Quondam hoc indigenae vivebant more  All then was innocence content and ease  While yet simplicity had pow'r to please  Wit had not learn'd to gloss and varnish crimes  Nor was vice call'd the fashion of the times  Nulla super nubes convivia caelicolarum  Prandebat sibi quisque Deus  To clubs at Bootle's Arthur's none could roam  Each hospitable baron liv'd at home  Beneath his roof the welcome guest might stay  Unplunder'd of his all at midnight play  Leagu'd at a Faro bank no sharpers sat  Nor for a wager could devour a cat  Hoyle had not taught his rules of cards and dice  Great legislator of a nation's vice  On morning wings no news abroad could fly  To blot out truth and propagate the lie  Nec rota nec furiae nec saxum aut vulturis atri  Poena sed infernis hilares sine regibus umbrae  No pamphlet scatter'd from a traitor's pen  Raw metaphysics and false rights of men  From France no agent of a desp'rate band  Could spread his froth and venom through the land  Atheists Socinians Puritans unknown  No fierce Republicans to shake the throne  No wars envenom'd by religious hate  Nor Whig nor Tory to convulse the state  All were one party in their country's cause  And the King reign'd a subject of the laws  Love then in mutual bonds mankind could draw  Nature their guide simplicity their law  Pure health and peace sincere contentment gave  The women virtuous and their husbands brave  Lo now an heiress weds fair smiles the hour  That lights her onward to the nuptial bow'r  The gentle loves attend each genial night  Till the fell serpent poisons their delight  Cards and the piquetfriend engross her cares  His time her lord with grooms and jockeys shares  And while her pinmoney his lands produce  She brings him nothing for his sep'rate use  To Doctors Commons soon they wing their way  And publish mutual shame in open day  To the adult'rer she resign her charms  Her lord lives joyless in a strumpet's arms  Till fame health wasted in the dregs of life  He advertises for a pregnant wife  But where the bard to paint in varied rhymes  The manycolour'd guilt of modern times  Nunc si depositum non inficietur amicus  Si reddat veterem cum totâ aerugine follem  Prodigiosa fides et Tuscis digna libellis  Quaeque coronatâ lustrari debeat agnâ  Egregium sanctumque virum si cerno bimembri  Hoc monstrum puero vel mirandis sub aratro  Piscibus inventis et foetae comparo mulae  Now if by chance you meet a man that's just  True to his friend and faithful to his trust  All prodigies must yield to one so rare  The Ouran Outang and the Panther Mare  To see the miracle what crowds will go  Lever's Museum has no equal snow  Who while the truth no witness can attest  Who hears the voice that whispers in the breast  The book the perjurer takes without dismay  False as the hypocrite in Gibber's play  Secure from mortal ear and mortal eye  Though Heaven behold him Heaven he can defy  Tam facile et pronum est superos contemnere testes  Si mortalis idem nemo sciat Aspice quantâ  Voce neget quae sit ficti constantia vultûs  Per solis radios Tarpeiaque fulmina jurat c  With eyes upturn'd as angels they would meet  With features marshall'd to disguise the cheat  Of human laws if he escape the rod  Safe from the pillory he braves his God  What if he shine with modern doctrines fraught  By Toland Tindal and Spinoza taught  Sunt in Fortunae qui casibus omnia ponant  Et nullo credunt mundum Rectore moveri  Naturâ volvente vices et lucis et anni  Atque ideo intrepidi quaecumque altaria tangunt  Of the First Cause he shakes th' eternal throne  And plastic nature rules the world alone  Unbid the seasons in their turn advance  And day and night are regular by chance  A gay freethinker all his doubts suppress'd  And in rank fate his willing heart at rest  He owns no ruling Mind in yonder sky  Nor fears lest matter overhear his lie  Yet some there are form'd in a softer mould  On whom religion still maintans her hold  Hic putat esse Deos et pejerat atque ita secum  Ut sit magna tamen certè lenta ira Deorum est  Si curant igitur cunctos punire nocentes  Quando ad me venient Sed et exorabile Numen  Fortassè experiar solet his ignoscere multi  Committunt eadem diverso crimina fato  Ille crucem sceleris pretium tulit hic diadema  Who think Eternal Wisdom guides the ball  And that the crimes of men for vengeance call  Before their eyes yet vain illusions play  And by false reas'ning they themselves b  tray  Hear Harpax speak "Yes punishment" he cries  "Pursues the man of guilt where'er he flies  "But when or where will justice strike the blow  "Severe though Heaven may be its wrath is slow  "Since pray'rs are wafted to the throne of grace  "Welltim'd repentance may each crime efface  "That guilt has various lots the fact is known  "One cuts a Nabob's throat and then his own  "While the poor villain by the halter dies  "Rich with illgotten spoils contractors rise  Decernat quodcumque volet de corpore nostro  Isis et irato feriat mea lumina sistro  Dummodo vel caecus teneam quos abnego nummos  "Better with loss of ears a plum to hold  "And gain by perfidy a nation's gold  "Than pass in dull morality my days  "To gain the cold benevolence of praise  "Through life unfriended starve for worthless fame  "And leave in chizzled stone a beggar's name"  Thus thinks the man whom avarice inspires  Whom guilt incites and mad ambition fires  Tum te sacra ad delubra vocantem  Praecedit trahere imo ultro et vexare paratus  Creditur a multis fiducia  Cite him to swear he'll to the altar fly  Attune his voice and teach his looks the lie  Intrepid falsehood gains upon the ear  And bids ev'n fraud with dignity appear  Tu miser exclamas ut Stentora vincere possis  While you astonish'd roar with lungs of brass  Lungs that e'en Homer's Stentor can surpass  For you all nature must forget her laws  And warring elements assert your cause  To lance their thunder if the gods forbear  With Epicurus you deny their care  Aspice quae contra valeat solatia ferre  Et qui nec Cynicos nec Stoica dogmata legit  Curentur dubii medicis majoribus aegri  Tu veniam vel discipulo committe Philippi  But still to soothe your woes hear reason's rules  Rules from no ancient from no modern schools  Through your parch'd veins when burning fevers fly  To  Peirson Turton Brocklesby  apply  Your trust in  Myersback  you now may place  Send him your vial and he'll know your case  Si nullum in terris tam detestabile factum  Ostendis taceo nec pugnis caedere pectus  Te veto nec planâ faciem contundere palmâ  Quandoquidem accepto claudenda est janua damno  Et majore domûs gemitu majore tumultu  Planguntur nummi quam funera Nemo dolorem  Fingit in hoc casu vestem diducere summam  Contentus vexare oculos humore coacto  Ploratur lacrymis amissa pecunia veris  Of fraud can life no more examples shew  If none rave on and aggravate your woe  Yes bar your door and pierce with shrieks the air  Your panting bosom beat and rend your hair  Such scenes are play'd when a rich father dies  Such scenes are play'd when husbands close their eyes  At fun'ral rites such sorrows oft appear  For gold none shed the counterfeited tear  For gold men ransack earth and sea and air  For gold they forge vote lie defraud forswear  Go seek the courts to Westminster retire  Where Jews give bail and evidence for hire  Sed si cuncta vides simili fora plena querelâ  Si decies lectis diversâ ex parte tabellis  Vana supervacui dicunt chirographa ligni  Arguit ipsorum quos litera gemmaque princeps  Sardonychum loculis quae custoditur eburnis  There in the place where Justice holds her scale  Against all truth see villany prevail  One gives his bond th' attorney if you sue  Proves it discharg'd and finds the witness too  Is the debt obsolete and out of date  A tale suborn'd th' attorney can create  With glav'ring smile he talks with you apart  Professing candour with a treach'rous heart  And then for hire his promise can deny  Licens'd to practise to betray or lie  For hire th' attorney goes where wild despair  And moonstruck phrenzy rend the howling air  With pious leer there draws his venal quill  And in the name of God begins a will  Sets for the moment the strait waistcoat free  Earning by dark iniquity his fee  Calls to his aid the keeper of the den  And for a lunatic conducts the pen  Observes all forms and in the hour of need  Swears THE INTESTATE understood the deed  Such crimes abound yet delicately nice  Tene O delicias extra communia censes  Ponendum quia tu Gallinae filius

of crimes  Confer  Conductum latronem incendia sulphure coepta  Atque dolo primos cum janua colligit ignes  The ruffian here by hope of plunder led  With silent pace at midnight seeks your bed  There the old servant who should guard your life  The murd'rer brings and arms him with the knife  This binds th' insurer for his stock to pay  His stock the following night conveys away  He steals unseen to wake the ambush'd fire  Till through the dome the curling flames aspire  From house to house the conflagration spreads  And the roofs topple on the sleepers heads  The infant wakes amidst surrounding woes  And clinging to its mother closer grows  But ah no help the elements conspire  And wretches doom'd by villany expire  What place is safe no check the plund'rer feels  Confer et hos

This night he robs the Chanc'llor of the Seals  Next in the mansion of the Pow'r Divine  Pilfers the chalice from the sacred shrine  Or the thin gilding from the altar breaks  And the poor curate's tatter'd surplice takes  See where the murd'rer meditates his plan  In secret practice on the life of man  His deadly aconite infus'd with art  Invites the lip and rushes to the heart  In gilt buffets oft hovers instant fate  And LAURELWATER aims at your estate  The gayfac'd gambler burnishes in vice  And loads at once his pistols and his dice  Haec quota pars scelerum quae custos Gallicus urbis  Usque a Lucifero donec lux occidat audit  More felons swarm in each revolving year  Than BOND can seize or Sir John Hawkins clear  Hawkins has enumerated fourteen or fifteen ways by which felons may escape    At mercy's call if justice spare a few  What Bay of Botany can hold the crew  In the wide waste ye mariners explore  Some hidden islands some untrodden shore  Where rear'd and foster'd by Britannia's care  Their rebel issue may for war prepare  In time forgetting spite of ev'ry tie  Their fathers did not on a gibbet die  Nullane perjuri captis fraudisque nefandae  Poena erit  But still shall guilt know neither shame nor awe  Shall fraud shall perjury escape the law  Law without morals nothing can avail  Blunt is her sword and useless hangs her scale  Your penal code ye legislators pen  You may make hypocrites not honest men  But let the pillory exalt you cry  The perjur'd knaveyour rage he'll there defy  The culprit there for favour never begs  But worth a plum enjoys his

reason'd on th'immortal soul  To his accuser give the poison'd bowl  Your pangs my friend revenge can ne'er requite  Quippe minuti  Semper et infirmi est animi exiguique voluptas  Ultio  Revenge of little minds the low delight  Cur tamen hos tu  Evasisse putas quos diri conscia facti  Mens habet attonitos et saevo vulnere pulsat  Occultum quatiente animo tortore flagellum  Yet think not that the wretch who finds a flaw  To baffle justice and elude the law  Unpunish'd lives he pays atonement due  Each hour his malefactions rise to view  Vengeance more fierce than engines racks and wheels  Unseen unheard his mangled bosom feels  Poena autem vehemens ac multo saevior illis  Quas et caeditius gravis invenit et Rhadamanthus  Nocte dieque suum gestare in pectore testem  What greater curse can earth or heaven devise  Than his who selfcondemn'd in torture lies  From agony of mind who knows no rest  But bears his own accuser in his breast  What charm shall bid these horrors rage no more  Heal the hurt mind and gentle peace restore  That charm is virtue virtue can supply  Comfort in life and courage when we die  Virtue the purest blessing can impart  The conscience clear and selfapplauding heart  Spartano cuidam respondit Pythia Vates  Haud impunitum quondam fore quod dubitaret  Depositum retinere et fraudem jure tueri  Jurando quaerebat enim quae Numinis esset  Mens et

loiter and insipid grow  In vain for him the banquet spreads its store  The rarest banquet now can please no more  In vain for him the mellowing years refine  The precious age of the pure racy wine  In vain gay wit calls forth her magic train  He flies the scene to think and dwell with pain  No respite from himself with cares oppress'd  Nocte brevem si fortè indulsit cura soporem  Et toto versata

eyes  The temple bends its arches o'er his head  And the long isles their umber'd twilight shed  He sees the altar perjur'd where he trod  The violated altar of his God  He groans he rises but the conscious mind  Wakes to worse horrors than he left behind  Of his fix'd doom each object is a sign  A visitation from the Pow'r Divine  Hi sunt qui trepidant et ad omnia fulgura pallent  Cum tonat

 No more the tempest springs from gen'ral laws  The winds have now a preternatural cause  'Tis God in wrath that spreads his terrors round  'Tis God who now his enemies has found  'Tis God's right arm that shakes the distant poles  Wings the red lightning and the thunder rolls  Soon as the warring elements subside  And nature smiles with renovated pride  Remorse and horror now no more appal  'Tis Chance not Providence that rules the ball  Praeterea lateris miseri cum febre dolorem  Si coepere pati missum ad sua corpora morbum  Infesto credunt a Numine saxa Deorum  Haec et tela putant  A fever

where conceal'd he lies  Trac'd and detected in his mean disguise  He's dragg'd in fetters to the dungeon's gloom  Condemn'd in anguish there to wait his doom  Tandemque fatebere laetus  Nec surdum
