The Trader John a landsman brave  Left the dry ground to try the wave  But here the poet must rehearse  In soft and sweet and tender verse  How gentle Johnny had a wife  The joy and solace of his life  The sharer of his griefs and cares  Privy to all his great affairs  One who when ty'd in wedlock's noose  Had prov'd a helpmate sit for use  One whom he marriednot for whim  But who could keep his house in trim  No highslown miss or Belle or Beauty  A simple Girl that knew her duty  Had well obey'd her Father Mother  And counsell'd well her younger Brother  Healthy when young and rather stout  Moralnay more she was devout  And now a Christian quite at heart  She carefully fulfils her part  Well skill'd alike her house to guide  And serve the shop at Johnny's side  See now she works to help the trade  And now instructs her under maid  But 'tis her chief and special care  Her Husband's daily toil to spare  When sick or weary and opprest  To ease the troubles of his breast  To soothe his sorrows calm his fears  And help him thro' this vale of tears  Remind him where his treasure lies  And point to realms above the skies  Where when this shifting scene is o'er  The faithful meet to part no more  Now twenty summers or above  Have glided by and prov'd her love  And though they may have marr'd her face  Have ripen'd many a Christian Grace  Hence it may now be fairly guess'd  Her latest days shall be her best  John knows her worth and nowadays  He grows quite eager in her praise  For ev'ry calling friend is told  "My Wife is worth her weight in Gold"  To this blest couple there was born  One Daughter cheerful as the morn  A Maiden she of spotless fame  E'en in her mirth quite clear from blame  Train'd in Religion's "narrow way"  Her mind untainted by a Play  She hates your giddy glitt'ring scenes  Tho' long since enter'd on her teens  Sees all things in a proper light  And vice quite puts her in a fright  Prompt and obedient from a Child  Obliging humble meek and mild  Still before strangers as a mouse  Yet vastly useful in the House  Toils for the shop tho' seldom seen  Ahthere she sits behind the screen  There like some flower both sweet and gay  She shuns as yet the blaze of day  Well does her praise adorn my tale  A newblown Lily of the Vale  Now should perchance some fool draw near  And get to whisper in her ear  Of Plays and Balls and Fairs and Races  Fine midnight Routs and public Places  And wonder how she can endure  A life so useful and so pure  Extol her form her piercing Eyes  And tell a hundred flatt'ring lies  While the sweet praise he thinks she sips  The tortur'd Maiden bites her lips  Thinks his fine flatt'ry mere pretence  And longs to tell him to talk sense  Yet dreads to take the dunce in hand  Lest he should still not understand  But should he let his  vice  peep out  The meekey'd Girl can then turn stout  For once 'tis said in terms direct  A spruce and saucy spark she check'd  She grew so solemn in her speeches  The Bucks give out that "Nancy preaches"  And once put on the sweetest air  And begg'd a Carman not to swear  Thus while she spends her peaceful days  Her parents' care she well repays  Honors her father loves her mother  She'll prove methinks just such another  And tho' scarce seen except at church  The men won't leave her in the lurch  Some honest Christian man she'll strike  No Buck or Bloodfor like loves like  Next in my song of equal fame  Comes a good honest antient dame  John's motherwith no fault but one  I meanshe doated on her son  For when her own dear spouse was gone  Her whole affections fell to John  'Twas then the widow's age so great  Her prospects small her income strait  That Johnny weighed the matter well  And took her to his home to dwell  No cost or trouble did he grudge  For John had rightly learn'd to judge  That people once of little fame  But now of high and mighty name  Oft owe the glory of their station  To the mere help of Education  Quoth he"Were all men good and true  "Their wealth methinks might half be due  "To some good dame who now is found  "Quite thrust upon the mere back ground  "Besides he added half in tears  "A child is always in arrears  "In debt alas o'er head and ears"  Oh with what joy what thanks and praise  To the Great Length'ner of her days  What feelings not to be outdone  Tow'rds her dear John her only son  Did the good parent take her station  And kindly own the obligation  And now his tenderness she pays  By helping in a thousand ways  Deck'd in her best she comes in view  And serves the shop from twelve to two  Knows not each price perhaps quite pat  Yet keeps the croud in civil chat  Till John himself comes up to sell  A yard of lutestring or an ell  Next to the Cook her aid she brings  And does a hundred little things  Loves her own self to lay the cloth  To dress the sallad skim the broth  At shelling peas is quick and nimble  Tho' now grown tardy with her thimble  And always puts you quite at ease  Walks out and leaves you if you please  Plain as she seems has much good sense  And hence she never takes offence  And all agree for all are lenient  The good old Lady's quite convenient  Yet let me add if things go wrong  Madam soon shews her fears are strong  And then she gives a certain spice  Of plain and downright good advice  Talks in a most convincing tone  "Of what  she's  seen and what  she's  known"  And in a way that vastly wins  Will warn you of her own past sins  Tranquil at eve in elbow chair  Tells what her former follies were  Recounts her dangers nice escapes  Sad sufferings once and aukward scrapes  And while she paints her varied life  Adds wisdom e'en to Johnny's wife  John warn'd of her each matter weighs  And Nancy trembles and obeys  Thus some old seaman once so brave  And buffeted by wind and wave  Of the rude seas too long the sport  Enters at length some peaceful port  Rejoices now no more to roam  Yet acts as Pilot nearer home  END OF PART II
