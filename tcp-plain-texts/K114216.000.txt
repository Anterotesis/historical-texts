 LAWTRACTS  BY JOSEPH RITSON OF GRAYS INN BARRISTER  ET IN ARCADIA EGO  LONDON M DCC XCIV  CONTENTS  I THE OFFICE OF CONSTABLE  II THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT LEET  III A DIGEST OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE COURT LEET OF THE MANOR AND LIBERTY OF THE SAVOY  THE OFFICE OF CONSTABLE BEING AN ENTIRELY NEW COMPENDIUM OF THE LAW CONCERNING THAT ANCIENT MINISTER FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE PEACE  CAREFULLY COMPILED FROM THE BEST AUTHORITIES  WITH A PREFACE AND AN INTRODUCTION CONTAINING SOME ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY OF THE OFFICE  LONDON PRINTED FOR WHIELDON AND BUTTERWORTH FLEETSTREET  MDCCXCI  PREFACE  A SINCERE wish to benefit the com∣munity by furnishing its most ancient most constitutional and most useful officer with a compendious system or manual of his duty and powers carefully extracted from and upon an actual perusal of the best autho∣rities has produced the following sheetsa mere epitome in fact of the original com∣pilation But the utility of the measure seemed upon second thoughts to be more favoured by a pamphlet affording the fullest information in the narrowest compass than by a volume which the verbose prolixity of mo∣dern statutes vying as it were with each other in conveying the simplest regulation in the most embarrassing manner and greatest possible number of words would have ex∣tended to a size and price little calculated to invite the class of readers for whom it was principally intended The decision therefor was in favour of the briefest summary such a one as men who have little money leisure or capacity one or other or indeed all of  which are unfortunately too often met with in the composition of a modern constable might buy read and if possible understand  A small tract published under the direction of "the society as it is called for carrying into effect the kings proclamation" since the following pages were prepared for the press has not appeared to supersede the present attempt Of former publications on the subject it may be sufficient to observe that all or most of them have been looked into  The language however is generally that of the authority quoted and the books referred to which it may be occasionally necessary to consult are to be found in many booksellers shops and in the libraries of the four law so∣cieties few barristers at the same time are without all or most of them and some jus∣tices of peace it is presumed may possess "The Statutes at Large" It is undoubtedly a serious consideration that the persons and property of almost all but professional men should be subjected to laws which they are totally ignorant of and do not even know where to find or how unless by dearbought and fatal experience to get acquainted with and of which the mere study is sufficient em∣ployment for the best part if not the whole of a long life These "Statutes at Large" which while they preserve many acts that are  not and many more that ought not to be in force do not contain above half the number that are actually so  The private and local acts every where in force and no where to be met with are at least as numerous "How is this" exclaimed a lawyer one day "why all these proceedings of yours are manifestly illegal con∣trary to  Magna Charta  to the Bill of Rights to the li∣berty of the subject to " "Sir" says his client who was a churchwarden "we have got an act of par∣liament" And thus it is every little dirty parish in the environs of London must have a law for itself The churchwardens or overseers can provide the money the attorney wants a job the justice looks forward to the pe∣nalties and the  gemmen of the westry  like authority an act of parliament is accordingly obtained and being an admirable compound of ignorance and knavery cannot fail of proving exceedingly beneficial to the community To the statutes which  are not  and  ought not to be in force  may be added those which are altogether doubtful and till they come in question cannot be positively said either to be in force or not The drawer of a modern act of parliament seldom troubles himself about former laws on the same subject he erects the new house and leaves the old one standing It is a wellknown observation of a grave and learned serjeant that an act of parliament was much wanted to repeal all the laws made for thirty years past This to be sure would be pretty well but a retrospect of two or three hundred would be infinitely better Lord Coke complains bitterly of the injudi∣cious penners of acts of parliament in his time "over∣laden" as he says " with provisoes and additions and many times on a sudden penned or corrected by men of none or very little judgment in law" Those acts however which gave such just offence to this truly learned and eminent lawyer will appear perspicuous as light and "brief as womans love" when compared with the endless and inextricable parliamentary labyrinths of the present century See also Black Com  are comprised in no less  than  sixteen closely printed quarto volumes  the Common Law is dispersed through near  two hundred folios  exclusive of every other size many of which exist only in a barbarous gibberish peculiar to the profession  It was long since objected as a fault to the profes∣sors of the law that they wrote their reports and books of the law in a strange and unknown tongue which none could understand but themselves to the end that people being kept in ignorance of the law might the more ad∣mire their skill and knowlege and esteem and value it at a higher price Preface to Sir John Davis's Reports published in  even a very imperfect  abridgement  of it filling no less than  twentyfour  This however is a com∣plaint which has been so frequently and so in∣effectually made  Bishop Burnet near a century ago pronounced the law "the greatest grievance of the nation" And the great lord Bacon who complains that the laws were then "subject to great incertainties and variety of opi∣nions delays and evasions" delivered a formal propo∣sition to king James I for their amendment and this at a time when the statutes were in  two  volumes and beside the year books there were but  four reporters  ex∣tant  that one must have pa∣tience  till the mischief every day increasing shall remedy itself till in short "there is A DROP TOO MUCH"  Sir William Blackstone observes that con∣sidering what manner of men are for the most part out into the office of constable it is per∣haps very well that they are generally kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers  Com  an observation to which it may be readily con∣ceived the compiler of the following Digest does not subscribe In fact he has ever re∣garded it as equally sarcastic illiberal and unbecoming and only to be accounted for by the professional character and habits of the writer who doubtless thought that  law  like  religion  being a  mystery  the  scriptures  should in both cases be locked up in an  unknown lan∣guage  or  unintelligible jargon  Com and Benthams Fragment of Govern∣ment Preface p xxxv  that the  pro∣fane  ought to know no more than the  initiated  may think fit to communicate and that in short the most ignorant are the most trac∣table and consequently the fittest for good Christians and good subjects If the powers which the law has vested in the constable be so large that it is even dangerous he should know them why were they given him why  are they not taken away why is he to be punished for neglecting duties of which it is best he should be ignorant Would it not be full as well considering what manner of men are for the most part put into the office of justice of peace if they too were to be kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers This indeed it may be is already the case though they do not on that account seem the less inclined to abuse them But wherefor is it that such "manner of men" are put into the Office of Constable Because upward of a hundred acts of parliament which few ever see and still fewer comprehend  The emperor Caligula it is said caused his laws to be written so small and placed so high that though all might clearly see none could possibly read The English law is thought by some to bear in many instances a great resemblance to the Roman And it seems a maxim in both that  ignorantia legis non excusat  Others have not hesitated to say that British statutes resemble cobwebs placed in darkness and obscurity for the purpose of en∣trapping the smaller flies in order to glut the  bottledspiders  of Westminster Hall with their blood But these no doubt are the ravings of beggered suitors and con∣sequently not to be regarded  added to the arbitrary and capricious decisions of some courts and the ignorance and innovation of others have redered it so burthensome ser∣vile vexatious and expensive that they who possess or usurp the power of filling it select  those who have nothing to recommend them but the willingness with which they receive the yoke and the patience with which they bear it The reason given for this partiality is that  no  GENTLEMAN can accept  such an office  poverty both in purse and in spirit being looked upon as the proper qualification for a consta∣ble These same GENTLEMEN it should seem are  highmettled horses  who would kick and wince and play the devil in short if you at∣tempted to put them in the shafts the VUL∣GAR are  asses  who tamely submit to every in∣dignity But gentleman or no gentleman he who can best afford to lose his time and mo∣ney who has spirit and ability to sustain fa∣tigue and resolution to oppose insult and op∣pression is the fittest person to discharge the Office of Constable To confer it from what∣ever motive upon people of base or inferior condition was long ago reprobated by lord Bacon as "a mere abuse or degenerating from the first institution  Law Tracts  " And certainly the ne∣cessity of a man who depends upon his daily employment for the daily bread of himself and his family and whose time is of course the most precious ought to be a sufficient excuse in any court of justice why he should not be  compelled to serve this office only it would probably cost him more to obtain the deter∣mination than he can value his time at It is doubtless a very scandalous insinuation that justices of peace who have some how or other acquired the power of making constables se∣lect the meanest and most ignorant by way of magnifying their own wisdom and conse∣quence gems it is well known which re∣quire no foil to increase their lustre  It is by no means a less abuse when a person every way fit for the office is pitched upon to admit in his stead any worthless fellow that he can procure base enough to serve the duty for a few guineas What integrity or pro∣priety of conduct can be expected from one whose necessity renders every shilling that is offered him an irresistible temptation The great Shakspeare has satirised this practice with admirable pleasantry in his play of  Mea∣sure for Measure  where he introduces the character of a foolish substitute bringing a charge before one of the dukes deputies  Escalus  Come hither to me master Elbow come hither master constable How long have you been in this place of constable  Elbow  Seven years and a half sir  Esca  I thought by your readiness in the office you  had continued in it some timeAlas it hath been great pains to you they do you wrong to put you so oft upon it Are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it  Elbow  Faith sir few of any wit in such matters as they are chosen they are glad to choose me for them I do it for some piece of money and go through with all  There is another not overwise constable in the Comedy of  Much ado about Nothing  and again in that of  Loves Labour Lost  It is to be hoped such a character is not so very common now a days    If the preservation of peace and good order be the interest of society the legislature would essentially contribute to that end in extending more effectual protection and encouragement to the constable This would be done by causing all the laws which authorise or oblige him to do particular acts or any way concern the execution of his office to be reduced into a single statute conceived in plain intelli∣gible language  A resolution of all the judges would answer the same purpose Something of this kind it is true was formerly attempted by a chief justice but being hastily carelessly and every way badly done was deservedly re∣jected by his brethren  and by requiring every court at the election of a constable to put a  copy of it into his hands in order that hav∣ing his power and duty constantly under his eye he might be without excuse in neglecting the one and without danger in exercising the other If it be true that every man who serves the public ought to be paid by the public it is most unreasonable and unjust that a duty should be imposed upon any one which if attended to as it ought to be would demand the greatest part of his time not only without making him the slightest recompence but even obliging him to be at what is to him a considerable expence for even the mere "consumption of time to him who lives by the sale of his time is equivalent to expence" Suppose therefor that every person duly elect∣ed a constable were during his continuance in office not exceeding one year exempt from all taxes and impositions parliamentary or lo∣cal and in case of actions against him touch∣ing his office the dread of which is one great obstacle to its due execution should be al∣lowed to defend not  in forma pauperis  but some really unexpensive mode  The defence of actions by an  innocent man  requires the fortune of a  rich one  Even a  pauper  who is to swear himself not worth  five pounds  in the world will have to provide  ten  or possibly  fifty  times that sum to prosecute or defend his suit  This if not an  adequate compensation would be a great re∣lief and in some cases at least an indemnity to persons serving the office would induce them to accept it with cheerfulness and ex∣ecute it with spirit conscious that in so doing they were benefiting society without injuring themselves  In some parts of the north the constable is intitled to an ancient  cess  charged upon certain lands which has formerly amounted to a pretty considerable sum  One cannot however have the satisfaction to think that a suggestion so ad∣vantageous both to the community and to the individual stands the least chance of ever passing into a law If indeed the proposal were for a productive tax upon constables or for the purpose of making bad worse or of heaping oppression upon the oppressed there would be little fear of its being adopted This therefor is another of those selfre∣forming grievances which must be patiently suffered to attain their  worst  state  To conclude If the following pages prove at all instrumental toward making a single constable more active confident and secure in the discharge of such of the powers and duties of his office as are any way beneficial to society for the less he attends to the others  the better the compiler will have reason to flatter himself that his efforts though humble have not been useless  ERRATA  p xxii  for  ordnance  read  ordinance  p  for  Mod  read  Mod  for  Freeman  read  Mod  p  after  Styles  add  Barnard  after

CONSTABLE which some etymologists have errone∣ously sought for in the Saxon language  See Lambard Sir T Smith and others  is un∣doubtedly to be found in the  Comes Stabuli  of the Eastern empire hence the  constabularius constabu∣lus  c of barbarous Latinity the  connestable  of the French the  conestabile  of the Italians  See Spelmans Glossary  voce  CONSTABULARIU    This  comes stabuli  was at first as his title imports no more than prefect or superintendant of the imperial stables or in other words the emperors master of the horse but having in process of time obtained the command of the army his name corrupted into  constabulus  and  constabularius  began to signify a commander and with this signification appears to have been introduced into England at the Norman Conquest or perhaps sooner since in fact some such officer seems to have been already known un∣der the title of  Stallarius  § THE CONSTABLE or LORD HIGH CON∣STABLE OF ENGLAND was an officer of the highest dignity and importance in the realm He was the leader of the kings armies and had the cogni∣zance of all contracts and other matters touching  arms or war  R z st c See also Madox's History of the Exchequer p c  This office which appears to have been granted by William the Conqueror to Walter earl of Gloucester or according to others to William Fitzosbern or Roger de Mortimer be∣came afterward hereditary in two different families as annexed to the earldom of Hereford and in that right after a lapse of near two centuries several persons enjoying the title and authority in the mean time was revived by judgement of law in the per∣son of Edward Stafford duke of Buckingham but Henry VIII thinking the office too high and dan∣gerous for the hands of a subject took the first op∣portunity of putting an end to it by cutting off his head Since this period there has been no lord high constable except  pro hac vice  as Robert earl of Lindsey was appointed in to determine the appeal of lord Rea against Ramsey and as some person or other is created at the coronation of a king or queen  § We had also CONSTABLES OF CASTLES that is keepers or governors so called of the castles of the king or great barons whom the French term  châtellains  from the Latin  castellani  and who were frequently hereditary and by feudal tenure such were the constable of the tower the constable of London or Baynardscastle the constables of the castles of Dover Windsor Chester Flint c some of which offices though not now hereditary are re∣maining to this day These are the constables in∣tended in  Magna Charta  cc and who in the statute of Westminster the first E c  are called constables of sees and there considered as keepers of prisons a constituent part indeed of all ancient castles Lord Coke observes that be∣fore  Magna Charta  these constables of castles had the like authority within their precincts as the sheriff had within his bailiwick and commonly sealed with their portraiture on horseback  Inst See also W c  The statute of H c which recites that by colour of their commissions as justices of the peace they took peo∣ple to whom they bore evil will and imprisoned them in their castles till they made fine and ransom for their deliverance and ordains that none be im∣prisoned but in the common jail seems to have put an end to a race of tyrants so odious to the people as to be usually represented in romances under the character of monstrous giants who not content with the property would eat the flesh drink the blood and grind the bones of the unwary and un∣fortunate traveler  § There was likewise formerly a CONSTABLE OF THE EXCHEQUER of whom we may read in the  Dialogus Scaccarii  l c in the statute  De Districtione Scaccarii  H st in Fleta l c and in Madox's History of that Court p c We also find mention made in some old sta∣tutes of THE CONSTABLE OF THE STAPLE See E c R c H c  § We now come to THE CONSTABLE OF THE HUNDRED OR HIGH CHIEF OR HEAD CON∣STABLE as he is otherwise called of whom we shall have a little more to say By the statute of  Wynton or Winchester E c it is or∣dained that in every hundred or franchise there shall be chosen two constables to make the view of ar∣mour as directed in the preceding part of the chap∣ter and that the constables aforesaid shall present before the justices assigned the defaults of armour and of the suits of towns and of highways and shall also present those who harbour strangers in up∣land towns for whom they will not answer They are likewise to present sheriffs or bailiffs who do not follow the cry of the county  It is agreed by Mr Lamberd  On Constables  by sir Edward Coke  Inst  and by sir Matthew Hale  P C  that con∣stables of the hundred were first introduced by this statute And though Fitzherbert  J P b  and Crompton after him  J P b  have asserted that they were conser∣vators of the peace at the Common Law and though it is said in other books that "notwithstanding the opinions to the contrary" the high constable was an officer at the Common Law and that the statute of Wynton only enlarged his authority  Keble Salk Mod L Rav  yet no one has hitherto produced the least evidence in support of such assertion On the other hand beside the au∣thority of Coke and Hale it has been expressly held from the Bench that a high constable is not such an officer nor conservator of the peace whereof the  Common Law takes any notice that he is not men∣tioned in any book and that in fine he is only by custom and for conformity  Cro Eliz where it is said that in the North they had no high constables which appears from Nordens  Description  p to be the case in Cornwall  It must be con∣fessed that the first mention made of the high con∣stable in any statute subsequent to that already cited is by E c  He afterwards occurs in H c H c H c c  And though sir William Blackstone has in one place attempted to carry up his antiquity as high as king Henry II  Com The  praepositus hundredi  whom the learned author has mistaken for the high constable seems to have been the bailiff of the hundred as  praepositus comitatus  is the sheriff and  praepositus manerii  the bailiff or reve of the manor  Vide  Spelman  in voce  The  praepositus hundredi  is frequently mentioned in Domesday Book  he in an∣other expressly mentions him to have been first or∣dained by the statute of Winchester  Com  After all however nothing can be more certain than that the constable of the hundred or high constable whether he be allowed an officer at the Common Law or not was instituted long before that statute This curious fact is ascertained by a writ or mandate of the th year of king Henry III preserved in the  Adversaria  to Wats's edition of Matthew Paris and from which chapters and of the statute of Wynton are evidently taken though it has hitherto escaped the notice of every writer or speaker upon the subject By this writ it is provided that in every hundred there should be constituted a CHIEF  CONSTABLE at whose mandate all those of his hun∣dred sworn to arms  i e  to have such arms accord∣ing to the quantity of their lands or chattels as there directed should assemble and be observant to him for the doing of those things which belong to the conservation of the kings peace  In singulis vero hundredis constituatur  UNUS CAPITA∣LIS CONSTABULARIUS  ad cujus mandatum omnet jurati ad arma de hundredis suis conveniant cis sint intendentes ad fa∣ciendum ea quae spectant ad conservationem pacis nostrae  No men∣tion it is believed of this officer can be any where found prior to the date of this instrument which however it may be contended no more determines the question as to his original creation than the sta∣tute of Wynton appeared to do the language in both cases being imperative and the only difference consisting in the word  eleus  chosen for  constituatur  constituted Be this as it will the discovery ought at least to teach not antiquaries alone but even lawyers and judges to look a little into matter of record and trust less to opinion which ought no more to be law upon the Bench than it is off it  § The CONSTABLE OF THE VILL or PETTY CONSTABLE as to distinguish him from the con∣stable of the hundred he is frequently called has been repeatedly acknowleged by the law to be "one of the most ancient officers in the realm for the conservation of the peace  Popham and below p  " and is declared by lord Coke to be as ancient as torns or leets be and not to have begun about the beginning of E as some have supposed  Inst His lordship here alludes to the opinion of Mr Lambard who says "About the beginning of the reign of K Ed petty constables were devised in towns and parishes for the aid of the constables of the hundred" An opinion which certainly detracts from the character of Mr Lambard as an industrious or judicious antiquary Lord Bacon on the contrary who allows the great antiquity of petty constables doubts that the high constable was not  ab origine  and only introduced for conveniency sake "when the authority of the justices of the peace who did not exist before the first year of Edw was enlarged by divers statutes" Law Tracts An idea equally erroneous  It must be confessed  however that no mention of him by this identical name is any where found to occur anterior to the writ or mandate already mentioned of king Hen∣ry III whereby it is provided that in every villate or township there should be constituted a constable or two according to the number of the inhabitants  In singulis verò villatis aliis constituatur  UNUS CON∣STABULARIUS  vel duo secundùm numerum inhabitantium provisionem praedictorum  It is nevertheless pretty certain that lord Cokes idea is right and that this officer is actually owing to the institution of the frankpledge usually attri∣buted to king Alfred and was in fact originally the senior or chief pledge of the tithing or  decenna  In support of this position we may observe that the constable or an officer resembling him is in many places at this very day called the  headborough tith∣ingman  or  borsholder  all names belonging to the chief pledge and to be found in numerous statutes in company with and as synonimous to  constable  See H c now repealed in which we have likewise a  thirdborough  See also Sir T Smith Com∣monwealth of England and Lambard on Constables  passim    that the statute of E c in which the name of  this  constable first occurs the words are "BURGHALDRES CONESTABLES  et gardeins de la pees  " and lastly that in the stat of H c the "CONSTABLES TITHINGMEN and CHIEF PLEDGES of every town are required to aid the venders of goods in disputes with the kings purveyors" It was therefor rightly adjudged in  B R    C  that "  decennarius prima facie  is the same with a con∣stable and differed little in the execution of that office" though Hale who has elsewhere told us all he knew about the matter said he was not the same officer  Ven It should seem indeed from Lambard and others that where there is a constable as well as a tyth∣ingman headborough or thirdborough in one and the same place the office of the latter is inferior to that of constable In Shakspeares comedy of  Much ado about Nothing  two of the characters are a "constable" and a "headborough" but though it is sufficiently evident that Master Dogherry the con∣stable takes a great deal more upon him than his "comp  t∣ner" yet as he supposes himself by much the wiser man it is not perfectly clear that he was invested with any greater degree of authority It is allowed however that where there is only a headborough thirdborough or tythingman his of∣fice does not at all differ from that of constable One is there∣for at a loss to conceive why the court Gould J should on the trial of Power for murder O B Sep ask one of the witnesses "What are you a  constable  or a  headborough A  I am  headborough  of Aldgate" "Was there  any consta∣ble  in the passage at that time  A  There was not" Since the arrest being illegal for want of a  warrant  it could make no difference what he was nor whether any constable sup∣posing Aldgate had  both  constable and headborough were present or not Sly the drunken tinker in the  Taming of the Shrow  is threatened by his hostess with the  "third∣borough"  and the term not being familiar to the London edi∣tors got corrupted into  headborough  which is evidently in∣congruous and absurd "  Third or fourth  or  fifth  borough" says he "I'll answer him by law" In  Loves Labour Lost  Goodman Dall says he reprehends the duke own person and calls himself "his grace's  tharborough  " Norden in his  Description of Cornwell  p tells us that "tythinges have  therdbarows  in some places  hedborows  in some  borrowsheds  and in the weste partes a tything man" And Ben Jonson in his  Tale of a Tub  introduces the "high constable of Ken∣tishtown" the "headborough" of Islington the "petty con∣stable" of Hamstead the "thirdborough" of Belsise and "the high constables man" This  thirdborough  is supposed by Blount a corruption of the Sax  n  freoborg  or freepledge but if one may be allowed the conjecture it  s not improba∣ble that as the  headborough  or chief pledge was the  first  man of the  ten  or  decenna  and had the s  q  r  authority so the first man of each of the r  maining  threes  that is the  first fourth  and  seventh  of the  nine  might have had some subordinate juris∣diction as his assistants and hence receive the name of  third∣boroughs  The common pledges were called  handbarrows  It therefor follows that the above ord∣nance  of Hen III far from instituting the office merely enlarged the number of officers placing them in towns and villages instead of franchises since it might frequently happen that a manor of great ex∣tent had only a single constable for several town∣ships a case exactly similar indeed sometimes oc∣curring at this day where a township comprehend∣ing several hamlets equally populous it may be with itself has only one constable for the whole  The book of  Villa  um  in the Exch  quer sets out all the vills and there cannot be a constablewick created at this lay unless by act of parliament M  d  We find the constable beginning to be familiarly known by that name in the time of king Edward I though  it is not a little extraordinary that not to mention Bracton who wrote toward the end of the reign of Henry III there should not be a word about him in either Britton  He seems to mean constables in chap by  gardeins de villes  or the Mirror and that he should be only incidentally named by the author of Fleta  He is supposed to have been one of king Edward the First's judges and by him committed to the  Fleet  Britton also is thought to have been a judge if not a bishop in the time of the same prince The Mirror was compiled by one Horne citizen and chamberlain of London in the reign of Edward the Second  who has express chapters on the different and most inferior ministers of the law in his time In certain articles of inquiry at the Eyre perhaps or Trailbaston certainly in the time of Edward I  Coll Madox Mus iii  are the following items  ¶  De ceus ke sunt  CONESTABLES DE VILLS  ou baylifs le roy ke unt lor garsouns ovek eus de atacher les felouns e il les fount garnir avant par quey lez comandemens le roy ne peussent estre tenuz en nul poynt  Of those who are constables of vills or bailiffs of the king who have their men with them to attach felons and cause them to give notice beforehand by whom the commands of the king could not be kept in any instance or it may mean and cause them the felons to be forewarned  i e  of the com∣ing of the justices whereby the kings commands cannot be observed c    ¶  De ceus ke desturbent les  CONESTABLES DE VILLS  ou bailifs ou autre ministre kil ne poent lor office fere  come il sunt charget per le roy pur la pes de sa terre garder  Of those who disturb the constables of vills or bailiffs or other ministers that they cannot do their office as they are charged by the king for keeping the peace of his realm    He seems also to be meant by the two following chapters of the Eyre as given in Fleta l c §§  De vic'  CONSTABULARIIS  vel aliis qui retonsores ceperint vel attachiaverint cum retonsura cruda vel cum platis seisitos qui pro mercede eos deliberaverint attachiamentum illud concelaverint  Of sheriffs constables or others who shall have taken or attached clippers or coiners seised with or possessed of the thing clipped or coined fresh or with or of unwrought silver and for reward shall have let them go and concealed the attachment    De vic'  CONSTEBULAR'  ballivis quibuscunque qui mercedem ceperint per sic quod pacerent fingerent attachiare suspectos vel qui eos attachiaverint sive Christianos sive Judaeos pro levi suspitione quos non in∣venerint seisitos cum retonsura ipsos pro mercede de∣liberaverint  Of sheriffs constables and bailiffs whomsoever who shall have taken reward for this that they should connive at and feign to attach suspected persons or who shall have at∣tached them whether Christians or Jews for a light suspicion and not finding them seised with the thing clipped shall have let them go for reward    Several of these charges or articles of inquiry even of the time of Hen III are extant in old chronicles but none of them has been found to make any mention of the constable  He is named in the statute of E c already  mentioned for the first time and in those of E c E c E st c and E st c in several statutes now repeal∣ed or obsolete in the reigns of R H and H in the H c c c  In the  Vision of  i e concerning  Piers the Plow∣man  are the following lines which may serve to give us some imperfect idea how he was considered in the time of that writer  i e  about the year  The king swore by Christe and by his crowne both  That wrong for his werkes should woo thorowly  And commanded A CONSTABLE to cast him in yrons  AND set hym not these seuen yeres see hys fete once  Fo xviii b  This passage is the rather curious as we do not elsewhere find that the constable had any power to put people in irons much less to detain them for so considerable a length of time Possibly however it is to be understood of the constable or keeper of a castle before mentioned although in must be con∣fessed that the expression would in this case have been more accurately THE  constable  since there could not well be more than  one  such officer attending the court  § Notwithstanding any thing that has been said or omitted in the course of this enquiry it seems highly probable that at the Common Law and be∣fore the mandate of Henry III the constable of the hundred and the constable of the manor were offi∣cers of the same nature and authority originating at the same time and differing only as to the extent of their several districts In short that they bore to each other the same analogy as subsisted between the  bailiff of the hundred and the bailiff of the manor and consequently that the local jurisdiction of the constable of the hundred was commensurate with that of the torn or leet at which he was elected be∣ing such part of the division only as was not com∣prehended within the jurisdiction of any other leet It follows therefor that the constable of the hundred neither possessed nor could have exercised any more authority within the precinct of the leet than the constable of one manor possessed or could have ex∣ercised in another the manor being to all intents and purposes exempt from and excluded out of the hundred  See Inst It should hence seem that at this day a warrant directed to all constables generally cannot be legally executed by the high constable within the limits of any petty constablery  The preeminence therefor which the constable of the hundred is supposed to have or may think proper to assume over the constables of manors or townships within the hundred is alto∣gether unfounded and imaginary and might with equal justice or propriety be claimed by the bailiff of the hundred or sheriff of the county over the bai∣liff of the manor or in short by any one constable over another whose district was more circumscribed for though as lord Bacon observes the high con∣stables authority hath the more ample circuit "yet I do not

subject to a particular leet shall not excuse a man from serving the office of constable of the hundred seem  to have been decided upon a wrong principle and to use an expression of sir Edward Coke "for want of the knowlege of antiquity  Keble Freeman Mod  "  All this however is spoken with an exception not of acts of parliament only which tinkerlike for one flaw they pretend to remedy make a hun∣dred  To offer advice to the legislature may be a pre∣sumptuous but is certainly a useless measure It would however lessen the mischief which almost every act of par∣liament unintentionally does if a general saving or proviso were introduced as is usual in private acts whereby every right law or custom not expressly taken away or altered by such act should continue in force  but also of the powers and pretensions exer∣cised or asserted by the quarter sessions which being generally composed of men who neither know nor care what the law is and who therefor consider themselves as a sort of legislative body and at li∣berty to do whatever they pleasefinding it per∣haps much easier to make new laws than to become acquainted with those already madehas in direct opposition to a positive rule

peace  THE costable was ordained to repress felons  E Cromp J P Inst  and to keep the peace of which he was and is a conservator by the common law  Conservators of the peace by the common law were in respect of their offices constituted for the purpose Those in respect of offices were and still are the king the chancellor or keeper of the great seal the lord high steward the lord marshall the lord high constable the justices of the court of Kings Bench the lord trea∣surer the master of the Rolls N B the last two are doubtful the sheriff the coroner and the pet∣ty constable Those constituted for the purpose and instead of whom are the modern justices of peace were ordinary extraordinary The ordinary were by tenure by election by prescription Those by tenure were such as held lands of the king by this particular service amongst others of keeping the peace within a particular district Those by election were such as were chosen to this office in pursuance of the kings writ by the freeholders in the county court And those by prescription were such as claimed this power by im∣memorial usage in themselves their ancestors predecessors or those whose estate they had in certain lands The extraordi∣nary were persons especially commissioned by the king in times of imminent danger to take care of and defend a particular district and to preserve the peace within the limits thereof The general authority of all these conservators was the same being that which the petty constable has at this day But none might award process or take recognizance for the surety of the peace beside the king the great officers already named and judges of record though all might take such surety by obligation See Hawk P C new edition and the authorities there cited    His office is  Hale P C  therefore original or primitive  Conser∣vator  as a conservator of the peace ministerial and rela∣tive to justices of the peace  Minister of the jus∣tice c  coroners sheriffs c whose precepts he is to execute  He is  Hale P C Comb Carth Salk L Raym Mod Foster n Black Rep H Black  however an officer only for his own pre∣cinct  Local juris∣diction  and cannot execute a warrant directed "to the constable of the vill" or "to all constables" gene∣rally out of that particular jurisdiction for he is a constable no where else nor is he compellable to do it though the warrant be directed to him by name but he may if he will and so may any other person  By G c in case any person against whom a warrant shall be issued shall escape into or be in any other county c it shall be lawful for any justice of that county c upon proof on oath of the handwriting of the justice who granted the warrant to indorse his name thereon which shall be a sufficient authority to the person bringing the warrant and all others to whom it was originally directed to execute the same in such other county c But even under this act a constable is not compellable to go out of his district  Comb  He is an officer of the court of quarter sessions  Officer of the Sessions  over whom they have power  This power seems to be given to the justices of the peace by the second clause of their commission "We have also as∣signed you and every two or more of you of whom c our justices to enquire the truth more fully by the oath of good and lawful men of the aforesaid county of all and all manner of felonies c And also of all sheriffs bailiffs stewards CONSTABLES keepers of gaols and other officers who in the execution of their offices  about the premisses  have unduly behaved themselves or have been care∣less remiss or negligent in our aforesaid county"    CHAP II OF HIS QUALIFICATION  Idoneus home  THE common law requires  Rep  that every con∣stable should be  idoneus homo  i e apt and fit to execute the said office and he is said in law to be  idoneus  who has these three things honesty knowlege and ability honesty to execute his of∣fice truly without malice affection or partiality knowlege to know what he ought duly to do and ability as well in estate as in body that he may intend and execute his office when need is diligent∣ly and not for impotency or poverty to neglect it for if poor men should be chosen to this office who live by the labour of their hands they would rather suffer felons and other malefactors to escape and neglect the execution of their office in other points than leave their labour by which they their wives and children live and the commonwealth consists  in the wellordering of particular towns and order will not be well observed in them but where the officers are  idonei  i e honest knowing and of ability And if one be elected constable who is not  idoneus  he by the law may be discharged of his of∣fice and another man who is  idoneus  appointed in his place  Better sort  The petty constables in towns ought to be of the better sort of resiants  Bacons L T  save that they ought not to be aged or sickly but men of able bodies in

do or dare not do what they should or are not able to spare the time to exe∣cute this office they are therefor to be able men  Able men  and to be chosen of the abler sort of parishioners and are not

CHAP IV OF HIS POWER AND AUTHORITY  Chief Jus∣tice  THE constable hath as good authority in his place as the chief justice of England hath in his  Roll Rep  Arrest of felon  ex officie  Where a felony is committed he may  ex officie  without a warrant arrest and imprison the felon till he can conveniently be conveyed to a justice of peace  H  le P C    or to the common jail And it is all one wherever the felony was committed if the felon be within his precinct  Killing felon  And if felon resists or flies  Hale P C Hale P C  whether after arrest or before and cannot be taken he may kill him and such killing is not felony nor causes forfeiture  Arrest on suspicion  Where a felony has been actually committed  Cromp J P Hale P C Mod Douglas Leadwith v Catchpole E G B R  the constable upon probable grounds of suspicion even from information of others may lawfully apprehend the suspected person and carry him before a magi∣strate And so may a private person do without a constable  Causes of suspicion  Now probable causes of suspicion are very many  Cromp J P Owen Rep Hale P C Bulstr  as for instance common fame hue and cry levied having part of the goods found upon him being in∣dicted of the like refusing to shew cattle charged to be stolen  Breaking open doors c  In case of a felony committed  Hale P C    or in danger to be committed as if  A  wounds  B  so that he is in danger of death the constable either upon complaint or upon a justice's warrant or hue and cry may break open the doors to take him if upon demand and notice he will not yield himself or entrance be refused And in that case if the constable kill the felon who cannot be otherwise taken it is no felony  Arrest in discretion  If  A  lose goods  Clayton  and charge  B  with stealing them and the constable searches  B's  house but finds none of the goods yet upon the charge and at the request of  A  he may arrest  B  but this is discretion∣ary since he had found no cause of suspicion on his search  Dismission or detainer  If the constable  Keilwey  having arrested a man for suspicion of felony finds that no such felony hath been com∣mitted the opinion of Keble Conisby and Frowike  was that he might let his prisoner go But by their opinions if a man be killed in fact and one is ar∣rested for that felony or for suspicion thereof al∣though the constable afterward finds that prisoner is not guilty still he may not let him go but he ought to be delivered by due course of law  Common jail  He may carry that he has arrested for felony to the common jail  E c E E Hale P C  and the jailor is bound to re∣ceive him  Imprisoning to prevent felony  He may imprison to prevent a felony by his office  Moore Pop  as if he see two with weapons drawn ready to fight in preservation of the peace and to prevent manslaughter which might ensue he may set both in the stocks Or if a man in fury be purposed to kill maim or beat another the constable seeing it may arrest and imprison him till his rage be passed for the conservation of the peace  Arrest in danger of felony  Where one beats another almost to death  Br Faux Imprison∣ment pl Cromp J P  and hue and cry is raised the constable may arrest the party and if he refuse the arrest may take power to arrest him and may beat him till he obey the arrest and may imprison him till he perceive whether the other will live and may then let him at large  Felonious intent  He may arrest and imprison one for a felonious intent  Moore Pop  as where a man had led away an infant of two years old into a church and there left it to perish for want of sustenance and the constable took him and set him in the stocks Also if a man lay an infant which cannot help itself upon a dung∣hill or in the open field so that the beasts or fowls may destroy it or where no one is bound by law to take it up but he who brought it thither whereby  the infant might perish the constable seeing it may commit the party so doing to prison  Affray c  If he see one making affray  Cromp J P  or assaulting another or breaking the peace or hear or know one to menace or threaten to kill wound maim or beat another he may take and set him in the stocks or

name  E Br Peace pl Br Suertie pl Cromp J P Inst Cro Eliz  but not otherwise and may certify it at the sessions  According to Lord Bacon he was to send it to the Exche∣quer or Chancery whence process

upon affray and such like he may raise the people of the realm to cause the peace to be observed  Commit∣ment for af∣fray  He may commit during affray in his own view  Cro E Br Faux Impris  but not after affray to compel the party to find surety of the peace as he cannot take any mans oath that he is in fear of his life  Hale P C  But he may upon complaint arrest the party and bring him before a justice of the peace to find surety or for appearance  Affray within doors  If men be making affray in a house  Cromp J P b Hale P C  and the doors are shut the constable may enter and see the peace kept And if manslaughter or bloodshed is likely to ensue and entrance upon demand is refused he may break open the doors to keep the peace and prevent the danger  Affray and flight  And if he who made the affray flies to a house and shuts the door  Cromp J P b  the constable may follow and take  him by fresh suit or otherwise where the other party is in danger of his life  Impending affray  And if he perceive that persons are about to make affray  Cromp J P  he may command them to disperse upon pain of imprisonment and if it appear likely to be a great affray may commit them to prison for a short time to prevent it  Stocks or jail  But he may not set one who hath broke the peace in the stocks  E  if he can have him to the next jail for the night  Watch  He hath power  ex officio  to keep a watch for the purpose to raise or pursue hue and cry upon robberies committed  Hale P C  by the statute of Winton c to search for lodgers in suburbs of cities that are suspicious persons which is to be done every week or at least once in days by the same statute c for such as ride or go armed by the statute of E c for night walkers and persons suspicious either by night or day by the statute of E c And it is in his power to hold such watches as often as he pleases and the watchmen are his ministers and assistants and are under the same protection with him and may act as he doth and regularly he ought to be in company with them in their walk and watch  A watchman hath a double protection of the law  viz  As an assistant to the constable when he is present or in the watch Purely as a watchman set by order of law and the law takes notice of his authority and the killing of a watchman in the execution of his office is murder Hale P C    Disorderly house  If there be disorderly drinking or noise at an unseasonable time of night  Hale P C  especially in inns taverns or alehouses the constable or his watch demanding entrance and being refused may break open the  doors to see

action sur le case Cromp J P  the constable upon complaint may oblige him  Quare  How He may present him indeed at the sessions or leet but the book should seem to imply something more as the man may be lost or starved for want of a lodging Inn∣keepers are in such case likewise subject to an action for da∣mages at the suit of the party grieved Godb Palm Roll R and it is a great pity their insolence is not now and then corrected by one or other of these methods    Night wal∣kers  He may apprehend night walkers  And so may his watchmen and commit them to custody till the morning Hale P C

what justice he will  Going armed  He may arrest persons coming before the kings justices with force and arms  E c  or who bring force in affray of the peace or go or ride armed  This is to be understood of going or riding armed with harness and weapons in an unusual warlike and terrific man∣ner Every man has by law a right to carry ordinary arms for the defence of his person and property and if necessary to kill those who offer violence to either    Deputy  He may make a deputy to execute his office in his absence  Cromp J P Bacon L T Moore Bol Roll R Roll A Sid W M c § Burr  and such deputy may execute warrants directed to the constable and do all other things per∣taining to the office of constable though he be not sworn  But he must be answerable for his deputy upon any

defective for supposing an offender who has committed a crime in Middlesex to escape from county to county till he gets into Northumberland the warrant being in∣dorsed by a magistrate of each he passes through whoever car∣ries the warrant to be last indorsed and by virtue thereof appre∣hends the offender must personally carry either the prisoner or his recognizance back to the original county and it will not be sufficient that he deliver either to a constable of the next ad∣joining county and so on nor in case he does deliver his pri∣soner to such constable will the warrant be any authority to him to carry the body forward Therefor let the constable in any case take heed how he acts  Disorderly houses  If two inhabitants of any parish or place paying scot and bearing lot give notice in writing to the constable of any person keeping a bawdy house  G  gaming house or other disorderly house in such parish or place he is to go with them to a justice of the peace and upon their making oath that they believe the contents of the notice to be true and entering into a recogni∣zance to give or produce material evidence enter into a recognizance in £ to prosecute such person for

to the chief constable requiring him to give notice to the constable of each parish c of the number of men appointed to serve and at another meeting are to issue an order to the chief constable to direct the constable to give notice to every man chosen to serve in the militia to appear at the next meeting when the constable is to attend and make oath of the service of the notice  And the constables are to cause the notice they re∣ceive from the chief constable of the time and place of exercise to be fixed on the church door  §  And constables  §  c are to billet militiamen when called

issue his warrant to the  chief constable or to the constables of the parishes c through which the militia is to march to pro∣vide carriages and drivers  And in case of actual invasion  §  or imminent danger thereof or in case of rebellion the lieutenant or deputy lieutenants are to issue orders to the chief constable who is to forward the same to the consta∣bles and they on receit thereof are to give notice to the militia men to attend at the time and place mentioned in the order  Highways  On the d of September in every year  G c  the consta∣bles churchwardens surveyor of the highways and householders are to assemble and make a list of ten inhabitants having an estate in the parish c of £ a year or personalty of the value of £ or being occupiers of house or land of £ a year to serve the office of surveyor of the highways and the constable is three days after to transmit a  duplicate  of the list to a justice of peace and return the  original  to the special sessions for the highways in the week after the Michaelmas general quarter sessions and is also within three days to give notice to the persons named in the list that they may appear at the special sessions to accept the office ten days notice of the time and place of holding the same being to be given to the constable by the justices And the constable is upon requisition of the justices to return an account in writing of the sum which an assessment of sixpence in the pound has raised or will raise within the parish c  Suspected thieves  Constables  G c  beadles and watchmen are to appre∣hend those suspected of conveying between sunset and sunrise any goods or chattels suspected to be stolen and carry them before a justice  Soldiers  The constables are to quarter and billet the officers and soldiers in

make and deliver to the justices upon oath signed lists of all houses liable to receive sol∣diers with the number billeted in each house And  Justices being duly required are to issue their warrants to the constables to make provision of car∣riages for troops on march  Warrants  Though the constable is not named in and W M c  Salk  nor appointed to be the officer to exe∣cute the warrants yet the justices may command him to execute them  The reason given is that "as at common law the consta∣bles were subordinate officers to the conservators of the peace so they are now the proper officers of the justices" But the pre∣misses are false and of course the conclusion bad they were conservators of the peace themselves    Present∣ments  A constable must either return his warrant  Salk  or certify what he has done upon it  He ought not to return the warrant but keep it for his own justificationSee G c    He should present all offences within his own knowlege  Dalton J P Fitz J P  which concern the peace as defaults of watching disorderly houses affrays c c at the leet tourn or quarter sessions And such present∣ment is as available as one made by twelve men  But he is not obliged to present a highway sworn before him by two witnesses to be out of repair  Vent  even though demanded so to do by the quarter sessions and may tell them plainly that he will not present it  N B  Although it be said in the pamphlet entitled "The Duty of Constables c" Gloucester that  they  "as well as other parish officers are to take care as much as in  them  lies that the  sabbath  be not  profaned  " the constable is no more concerned in preventing such  profanation  except in levying the penalty or inflicting punishment under the justice's warrant than any other person and as that part of the act C c which makes it penal for a man to exercise his trade or calling on what is called the Lords day savours a little too much of bigotry and Calvinism it will be most commend∣able and perhaps most adviseable if he in all such cases  wait for the warrant  What is innocent one day cannot well be criminal another    Discharge  He is not discharged of his office till his successor be sworn  Freeman  because the district cannot be without an officer  CHAP VI OF HIS PROTECTION INDEMNITY ALLOWANCES ADVANTAGES AND REWARDS  Aid of the country  THE constable shall have aid of the country to pacify affray  Cromp J P  Constables are usually summoned by the sheriff to attend at the quarter sessions and assizes to make presentments c which though not warranted by any express law must be allowed a very ancient usage but the following practice seems to be per∣fectly unjustifiable The grand inquest for the county of Middle∣sex previous to their sitting and before they are sworn issue a warrant under their hands and seals to the high constable com∣manding him to summon the petty constables who on making default are presented by the inquest and compelled to  appear  to the presentment in the crown office and take a copy of it which is attended with an expence of between and shillings and  here  the proceedings uniformly stop And this is done every term but surely without the privity of the Court of Kings Bench which can never sanction so illegal and oppressive a con∣duct No grand jury has the least power by law to require the attendance of a single person for any purpose whatever even after it is sworn and yet here is one which assumes that power even before it exists The warrant is sent to the high constable who is no officer of the Court of the Kings Bench and has no business to obey it And yet if any one thus irregularly called upon does not appear he will be subject to the above  fine  in the crownoffice For though the court would doubtless quash the presentment yet the getting it quashed would cost him a great deal more he is therefor obliged to submit to an unconstitu∣tional and oppressive measure because the remedy is worse than the disease See the warrant in the Complete Constable p If it be necessary for the constables to make their pre∣sentments to the grand inquest the court of Kings Bench should issue its writ for that purpose to the sheriff  Action  He is not suable out of the county for what he does in the execution of his office  Sty  General issue  If he be sued for any thing done by virtue of his office  J c  he  Double costs  and all who assist him may plead the gene∣ral issue Not guilty and give the special matter in evidence and on a verdict for the defendant or de∣fendants or on the plaintiffs becoming nonsuit or discontinuing the defendant or defendants shall have double costs  Cromp J P  And so of a deputy constable  But in this case the judge who tries the cause must order the  postea  to be marked  Ven Douglas  and certify that the de∣fendant was acting in the execution of his office  Murder▪  If in the execution of his office  Hale PC  after competent notice that he is constable he or any that come to his assistance be killed it is murder although the party killing do not know his person  But then as has been already observed he must be acting in his own district or division For if the constable of  A  come into the vill of  B  to suppress any disorder and in the tumult be killed this is only manslaughter because he had no authority in  B    Hale P C  The constable of St Margarets parish in Westminster having a search warrant directed to the consta∣bles of that parish came into the parish of St Paul CoventGarden and took a woman in the street near the theatre and carried her to the roundhouse where he was assaulted and killed by some who wanted to rescue her and this killing ad∣judged only manslaughter Because it was a sudden action without precedent malice Because the constable had no au∣thority at all in CoventGarden nor supposing he had any was the woman guilty of any disorderly act and it is not a constables suspecting that will justify his taking up any person but it must be just grounds of suspicion and it would be hard that the liberty of the subject should depend on the will of the constable or his not liking a womans looks be any cause of suspicion The prisoners had a sufficient provocation for it one be imprisoned upon an unlawful authority it is a suffi∣cient provocation to all people out of compassion much more when it is done under a colour of justice and WHERE THE LIBERTY OF THE SUBJECT IS INVADED IT IS A PROVOCATION TO ALL THE SUBJECTS IN ENG∣LAND By HOLT C J L Ray  There are other instances of a constable or his assistant being killed where he has been too officiously or imprudently because ignorantly acting as such and exercising an authority not given him by law which of course will in such case afford him no more protection than a common man See the trial of Wil∣liam Power for the wilful murder of John Wilkinson Sessions paper p where Gould J having consulted two of his brethren in directing the jury said  the thing being over it was unwarrantable in these people to seize this man thus quiet without having an authority from a justice of peace he was therefore illegally assaulted and arrested by these men when a man therefore is deprived of his liberty and does an act that causes the death of the assailant in any manner whatever certainly by law it reduces the offence to manslaughter  and so of course the jury found The de∣ceased had sent for the constable and given him charge of the prisoner for having drawn a knife on him twice and threaten∣ing his life and in helping the constable to force him away was unfortunately stabbed See also Leaches Cases in Crown Law These little accidents should operate to make every con∣stable more familiar with his actual powers which wherever there may be danger he ought always for his greater security to execute with sufficient assistance or properly armed since the hanging of his  murderer  though it be all the law can do will hardly restore him to life or recompence his family for his loss let him therefor learn to protect himself and let others also when he is usurping an illegal authority be taught to protect themselves against him  At present by G c the Westminster consta∣bles are to be appointed out of the different parishes for the whole city and liberty In London also by ancient custom the constables though appointed in particular wards of which there are twentysix have power to serve warrants and execute their office throughout the city    Notice  Coming to appease a sudden affray in the daytime in the place where he is constable  Hale P C  it seems every  man is bound to take notice that he is constable but it is not so in the nighttime unless there be some notification that he is constable But whether it be day or night it is sufficient notice if he declare him∣self to be the constable or command the peace to be kept in the king's name or the like  Trespas  If two men are combating  Cromp J P  and the constable come to part them and is hurt he shall have action of tres∣pass and if he hurt them they shall not have action against him  Hale P C  And so of those who aid him every man who is assisting to the constable in the execution of his office having the same protection that the law gives to the constable  Unjustly removed  If he be removed without just cause  Bulstr  the court of Kings Bench will by rule of court order him to be restored to his place  Cursing and swearing  If he be sued for seizing or prosecuting persons who swear or curse in his hearing  G c  he may plead the general issue and give the special matter in evidence and if he get a verdict or plaintiff be nonsuit or dis∣continue he is to have treble costs  Warrant  A justice of pe  ce's warrant is a sufficient justifica∣tion of a constable in a matter within the jurisdiction of such justice  Strange  Action  No action shall be brought against a constable  G c  or  any one acting by his order or in his aid for any thing done in obedience to a warrant under the hand or seal of a justice of peace until demand of the perusal and copy of such warrant and refusal or neglect for six days And if after demand and compliance an action be brought without making the justice a defendant the jury shall give a verdict for the defendant or defen∣dants notwithstanding any defect of jurisdiction in such justice And if such action be brought jointly against justice and constable the jury on proof of the warrant shall find for the latter And no action shall be brought against a constable unless com∣menced within six months  Note The above act extends only to actions of tort and therefor where an action for money had and received was brought against an officer who had levyed money on a convic∣tion by a justice of the peace the conviction having been quashed it was holden that a demand of a copy of the warrant was not necessary Bullers N P And although this act may afford the constable protection in a civil suit yet if the warrant be plainly illegal as for instance to apprehend a man for  adultery  or  incest  it seems the party may legally resist and if in defence of his li∣berty he kill the constable such killing is not murder but if on the other hand the constable should kill him he shall be ad∣judged guilty of murder  ☞ Of the above description perhaps are the warrants put into the hands of an uninformed constable who sup∣poses every thing to be legal which comes from a justice of peace who may possibly at the same time be as ignorant as himself for the searching after and IMPRESSING OF SEA∣MEN a practice in direct violation of every constitutional princi∣ple and certainly unsupported by any positive law Let the constable therefor who too officiously engages in a business so de∣servedly unpopular seriously reflect of the risk he runs let him dread the consequences of a spirited resistance He murders if he kill it is justifiable homicide or at most manslaughter if he be killed The law very properly encourages and invites all men to repress an act of illegality and violence and the rather as we have just seen if it be done under colour of justice See the case already cited in Lord Raymonds Reports and that of Hop∣kins Hugget in Sir John Kelyngs Cases of much greater consequence and authority than the flimsy reasoning used in de∣fence of presswarrants Observe also what is said by Lord Hale on this subject in his History of the Pleas of the Crown and consider whether the life liberty and happiness of the subject are to be blown away by an insidious sidewinded act of parlia∣ment It is no place here to enter into a discussion of the arguments used by Sir Michael Forster and Mr Butler on this subject which however might be easily refuted upon the most solid and legal as well as constitutional principles The practice is  very far from ancient  but were it ever so  NO DEGREE OF ANTIQUITY CAN GIVE SANCTION TO A USAGE BAD IN ITSELF  Bur    Militia list  Any

what he has done under it for he ought to keep the warrant for his own justification the sessions may fine him  It is said in Mod that a constable may be fined by the leet but not by the sessions considering him it should seem as an officer of the former court in which he is elected and not of the latter And it is to be observed that the commission of the peace gives the justices power to enquire of the misbehaviour of constables  by good and lawful men  and not to punish them in a summary way  Ideo quaere  And  vide  Gib  But the court of Kings Bench will not grant a  manda∣mus  Escape  If he wilfully lets a felon escape out of the stock  Hale P C    and go at large it is felony  Offender brought to the watchhouse  It is a misdemeanour in him to discharge an offen∣der brought to the watchhouse by a watchman in the night  And  per  Wilmot J though without a positive charge The principle of this doctrine is not altogether apparent The watch are by law assistants to the constable not the constable servant to the watch The watchman may be drunk the charge frivolous as that in the case was for "walking the streets  to pick up men  " or the like The only reason for charging the constable seems to be the actual offence of the party not the bare delivery by the watchman In many cases as affrays for instance or even a supposed felony he may lawfully discharge his prisoner whether arrested by himself or others and why not a man taken by the watch It is nevertheless a perilous privilege and ought to be cantiously exercised But to say he shall in no case whatever

the means of checking and by degrees that reformation may be produced by the fear of punish∣ment which the commands of the Supreme Being alas are too weak to effect"Alas and if a man were to stand cursing and swearing for a day together who except himself would be the worse for it If the Supreme Being have prohibited this practice which remains to be proved he will undoubtedly adapt a fit

supposed to have and in fact frequently found to assume a degree of authority over those who are called petty constables which is not given him by law For although some acts of parliament have impowered the justices to direct their warrants to him commanding him to issue his precepts to the constables who are subjected to a penalty for disobeying them yet even this gives him no authority his office being simply mi∣nisterial And in all cases where the justices make out such gene∣ral warrant not being empowered thereto by express statute it is conceived that the constables in disobeying the precepts of the constable of the hundred are not liable to punishment not∣withstanding any "faulty precedent in Burn" See the In∣troduction and Bacons Law Tracts p and Burns Justice    APPENDIX  N

INSTITUTION  VELUT UMBRA  LONDON PRINTED FOR WHIELDON AND BUTTERWORTH IN FLEETSTREET AND P BRETT OPPOSITE ST CLEMENT'S CHURCH IN THE STRAND  MDCCXCI  ADVERTISEMENT  IT was originally intended that the compilers publica∣tion on the subject here treated of should have comprised all that to his knowlege had been said or in his judge∣ment could be said upon it Large collections were made for the purpose and the work partly proceeded in but the bulk of the volume and the scanty sale it was likely to experience effectually discouraged him from proceeding with that plan and produced the Introduction and Analysis now presented to the public  INTRODUCTION  TO the concise view attempted in the following pages of the jurisdiction of the Court Leet it may not be improper to prefix a few words upon the name antiquity nature and present state of this ancient and venerable tribunal  I The name or stile of this court  NAME  as formally entered in its own proceedings is the "Court Leet and View of Frankpledge" The word  Leet  which it is very remarkable is to be found neither in the Saxon law nor in Glanvil Bracton Britton Fleta or the Mirror our most ancient law writers nor in any statute prior to the th year of King Ed III  C After which it does not appear again till the E c See also E c  though it is allowed to occur in the Conquerors charter for the foundation of Battle Abbey and not unfrequently in Domesday book  Spelmans Glossary  v Leta  seems to be derived from the Saxon leoð  plebs  and to mean the  populi curia  or folk mote as the Sheriffs tourn or Leet of the county at least appears to have been once actually called  Spelman  v  Folkesmote Kennets Parochial Antiquities Glos  v  Falmote  in contra∣distinction perhaps to the Halmote or Court Baron  which consisted of the free tenants only who being few in number might conveniently assemble in the Lords Hall whereas the Leet which required the attendance of all the refiants and concerned the administration of public justice was as there will be hereafter occasion to mention usually held in the open air The "view of Frankpledge"  visus franciplegii  means the examination or survey of the freepledges of which every man not particularly privileged was anciently obliged to have nine who were bound that he should be always forth∣coming to answer any complaint The better to under∣stand this we are to be informed that the kingdom being divided into countys or shires and each county into hundreds and each hundred into tithings each tithing containing ten families or households the heads of these families were reciprocally bound and responsible for each other so that in fact of every ten householders through∣out the kingdom each man had nine pledges or sureties for his good behaviour  Of these pledges the eldest or most respectable and first sworn was called the headborough or chief pledge and had a degree of authority over the rest not now exactly ascertained It was however in all probabi∣lity much the same with that of the constable who was formerly a character of great consequence and is to this day in many places called the  headborough  a word which according to Sir William Blackstone too implicitly following Sir Thomas Smith bespeaks its own etymology and means "the discreetest person in the  borough  " Great lawyers how∣ever are sometimes indifferent etymologists the word in fact implys nothing more or less than the chief pledge from borg borh or borhoe  fidejussor  a pledge or surety He was also called the  borsalder  borges  alder  i e  the eldest of the pledges and the  tithing man  Both  tithing man  and  borsholder  are to be found in modern statutes as synonimous with  constable  and  headborough  But at what period the constable became a distinct officer and the chief pledges were metamorphosed into a grand jury is a point which must be left to a more successful enquirer  This is the famous system of King Alfred so much applauded by both ancient and  modern writers which produced such singular effects among a barbarous and disorderly people that a man might have hung his purse by the side of a public road and found it untouched a month after or might have ridden with much treasure and no other weapon than a white wand from one end of the kingdom to the other  Ingulphus W Malmesbur Rob Glouc Lambard on Con∣stables Inst Roll R Hale P C Sir W Temples works vo III  Since however this so excellent and admirable institution is from whatever cause sunk into total disuse there not having been any freepledges in the kingdom for two or three centuries the words "View of Frankpledge" in the stile of the court seem now altogether unnecessary and improper It is also called a  Lawday  H c H cc P M c

indeed have got his information by attending the court when his father was  Bailiff    ANTIQUITY  II That the Leet is "the most ancient court in the land" for criminal matters that is the Court Baron being of no less antiquity in civil has been pronounced by the highest legal authority  H b Roll R  For though we do not meet with the  word  among the Saxons there can be no doubt of the existence of the  thing  The venerable chief justice who lately retired from the elevated situation  in which he had so long presided found this court "coeval with the establishment of the Saxons here" and its activity "marked very visibly both amongst the Saxons and the Danes  Bur  " In those times whoever possessed a vill or territory with the liberties of  soc sac  c a long string of barbarous words was the lord of a manor had a court leet court baron and in a word every privilege which it seems to have been possible for the monarch to bestow or for the subject to acquire  Vide  Spelman  v Manerium  The position used by Fineux in H that the Leet is derived out of the Sheriffs Tourn is not intitled to any particular notice being a mere unsupported  dictum  to which neither Lord Cokes adoption Inst nor that of Lord Mansfield Bur can add any weight Much matter and many authorities must be sacrificed throughout this little enquiry for the sake of brevity As to the rest the word Leet though generally appropriated to the court of a manor has in fact nothing essentially distinct from the Tourn but the being upon a smaller scale See however Britton c E E c Those writers therefor who suppose the Leet of a hundred or manor inferior to or subject to the controul of the Tourn or Leet of the County are egregiously mistaken the jurisdiction of the latter being con∣fined to so much of the county or hundred as is not comprised within the precinct of the manor See Inst It is indeed repeatedly said in our old books that things of which the Leet of a manor that is omits to enquire shall be enquired of in the Tourn which may well be and the reason is that the lord has forfeited his leet for the time  quoad  the parti∣cular object it being very clear that when the Leet of a manor is by any means lost the resiants owe suit to the tourn and that although they should be within a hundred in the hands of a private person    III  NATURE  The Leet is a court of record for the cognisance of criminal matters or pleas of the crown and necessarily belongs to the King though a subject usually the Lord of a Manor may be and is entitled to the profits consisting of the essoign pence fines and

See also Keble It is however said that presentments of constables at the Sessions and of course it  presumed in the Leet shall be as good and available as a presentment made by men Fitz J P  This practice in substance at least is of prodigious anti∣quity and is perhaps the only perfect representation still  extant of the criminal part of the constitution Before the conquest and probably for some time after this court of the Leet was if not the sole at least the most usual dispensary of criminal justice in the kingdom No crime in those remote ages appears to have been punished by death unless it were that of open theft where the offender was taken with the  mainour  that is with the thing stolen upon himand of this crime and this only the cogni∣sance did not belong to the Leet  The elucidation of this circumstance would form a curious if not an interesting article but could not be easily compressed within the com∣pass of a note and in fact belongs more properly to a different work  All other offences of what nature or degree soever subjected the party to a mulct or pecuniary fine which was in many cases de∣terminate and fixed "For two hundred shillings" observes an ingenious writer "you might have killed a peasant for six times as much a nobleman for sixandthirty times as much you might have killed the king A king in those days was worth exactly shil∣lings  Benthams Introduction p clxxvi It should be observed how∣ever that the King valued himself Friend Panurge did not think King Anarchus worth quite so much when he made him a cryer of green sauce  " This pecuniary composition with respect to certain capital offences was abrogated and the punish∣ment of death substituted in its place by K Henry I  Spelman  v Felo  Wilkins LL Sax In fact there is a  ordinance to this effect among the laws of Canute William the conqueror considering punishment by death as too lenient and merciful ordered of∣fenders to be mutilated  Eruantur oculi abscindantur pedes vel testi∣culae vel manus c  Neither does the law of Henry I appear to have been invariably observed if indeed it were not actually repealed See Mr Reeves's learned accurate and interesting History of the English Law Vol I pp Glanville after enumerating hightreason the concealment of treasuretrove pleas of the kings peace broken homi∣cide arson robbery rape forgery and the like adds which crimes are punished by death  ultimo supplicio  or mutilation  memb  o  um trun∣catione  l c  How far this alteration might affect the Leet we are not now able to discover But it is not improbable that the distinction of  indictments  for felonies and  presentments  of inferior offences owes its origin to the above measure It is still doubtful however what became of a person indicted at the Leet for a capital offence before the in∣troduction of the petty jury as it is now called in the reign of Edward I or Henry III  This second jury was originally and for many years considered merely as witnesses See an excellent account of this institution in the valuable work just quoted  as it should seem that supposing an indictment positively affirming such a one to have committed a capital crime had been returned to the kings justices at the  iter  or jail delivery  Dr Hickes thought that Justices itinerant were originally insti∣tuted by Henry II  Dis Epis  p But Mr Madox has pro∣duced evidence of their existence in the reign of King Stephen Hist Ex p  the punishment must have been awarded without further pro∣cess or any plea traverse or answer from the party of course that they had nothing to do but to pronounce sentence of death a presentment of any fact upon the oath of twelve men judicially appointed to enquire there∣of being always conclusive by the ancient law as indeed it is in many cases particularly with respect to offences  of which the enquiry as well as the punishment still belongs to the Leet at this day  In aid of Eyres says the Mirror are turns of Sheriffs necessary and views of frankpledge and when that good men at such inquests in∣dicted any of mortal sin Kings used to destroy them without answer which usages still remain in Germany but by warrant of pity and of mercy and for that the frailty of man cannot be held from sining it is accorded that no one appealed or indicted be destroyed without answer c f The more general mode however of proceeding against cri∣minals was by appeal the consequence of which was either duel or purga∣tion if a freeman by fire  per ferrum callidum  or if a rustic by water death or mutilation and banishment awaiting the unsuccessful And it must be confessed that by Constitutions of Clarendon to which it is possible the Mirror may allude it should seem as if the party indicted by the inquest of a Leet would have been subjected to the same purgation Wilkins LL Sax c Hist of the English Law i See also Glanville l cc The subject which is singularly perplexed and obscure both demands and deserves the most copious and minute inves∣tigation from the learned and sagacious antiquary But this is not the age of a Spelman a Selden or a Hickes  It has been said by Sir Edward Coke and repeated by the noble judge already mentioned that by the clause  Nullus vicecomes  c in the Great Charter  No Sheriff Constable Coroner or other  our  Bailiffs shall hold pleas of our crown c And whether they did so became an article of enquiry at the  Eyre  And yet in a writ issued in  H  for the inter∣pretation of another clause in this Charter it is expressly admitted that pleas of the Crown might be held at the Hundred and Wapentake courts "  nisi ita sit quod ad Hundreda illa et Wapentakia fieri debet inquisiti  DE PLACITIS CORONAE  sicut de morte hominis thesauro invento et hujus∣modi  " Prynnes Animadversions In short it is very well known that both Sheriff and Coroner have held pleas of the crown ever since the granting of the great charter and do so at this day It appears however from Glanville that the crime of theft at that time belonged wholly to the Sheriff and was to be pleaded and determined in the  county court  And that he had also cognisance of medleys or affrays batteries and wounds unless where the addition was made of the Kings peace broken l c l c These therefor one might think were the plea  of the crown taken away by  Magna Charta  that is the criminal jurisdiction of the county court if it did not appear both from Fleta l c and Hengham Magna c that such sort of pleas were still held by the Sheriff In any case it is nothing to the Leet  "the  jurisdiction of the Leet was abridged its power to hear and determine taken away" but it has been said and repeated without due attention either to the nature and constitution of the Court or to the law of the time No offence it is well known is at this day or for aught that appears ever was heard and determined in the Leetnor before the period refered to by any other criminal court in the kingdomotherwise than upon the presentment of twelve menor what we now in most courts call the Grand Jury This presentment as has been already observed found and established the fact and judgement whether of  misericordia  mutilation or death followed as an incident or matter of course precisely indeed as the punishment does at this day on the ver∣dict for the king of the petty jury In fact therefor the jurisdiction of the Leet was not in the least abridged or affected by that charter nor is it at all probable that the Barons would either seek or suffer the diminution of their own privileges of which on the contrary there is an express saving  That this court has no power to enquire of the death of a man or of rape  Lete Hundr Br Leete  is a more ancient but not less erroneous opinion The contrary is most directly and expressly held in the  Statutum Walliae  in Britton Fleta the Mirror and the statute or whatever it is of Ed all much older and better authorities than the book of Assises  E pl A doubt is suggested in H whether the Leet can enquire of high treason and an opinion given in Br Ley Gager against its power but this as my lord Coke observes on a similar occasion happened "for want of the knowlege of antiquity" See Inst It is a no less extraordinary  dictum  in Dyer b that an indict∣ment of assault and battery found in the Leet  without blood shed  is void the principal case being a  fine  for an assault  in disturbance and contempt of the Court  He might possibly allude to the book case of E which by no means supports his doctrine as the plaintiff whose counsel makes that allegation took nothing by his writ  in which that opinion first appears If in∣deed  the reason of the exception be that the enquiry of these two crimes belonged properly to the Coroner it may be readily admitted without impeaching the jurisdic∣tion of the Leet The Coroner took cognisance of death  super visum corporis  and of rape as well as other offences by appeal only It follows therefor that in every in∣stance either where he could not or did not act the enquiry must be in the Leet otherwise the offender should have escaped without punishment which would be absurd They who suppose Rape as a  felony  to be excepted be∣cause it has been made so by act of parliament and allow it to be enquired of as a trespass  Tourne de Viscount Lete Hundr' Br Leete c c  seem to have forgot that it is a trespass by act of parliament  W E c  and a felony at common law  Vide  the following summary in the margin  they should have also recollected the general rule that where a trespass is by statute turned into felony the trespass is merged  Bullers Nisi Prius If indeed the statute of W operated a an alteration of the common law and was not virtually repealed by that of W E st c it would seem to follow that Rape cannot be enquired of at all in the Leet either as felony or trespass    It is indeed unaccountable how such groundless assertions come to be made There is no point better settled than that the Steward of a Leet may award to prison persons either indicted or accused of felony before him or  uilty of any contempt in the face of the court And  et lord Coke has not hesitated to assert that the Leet  hough a court of record hath no power to imprison  Rep b Roll Rep    n assertion in which he is positively contradicted by every  uthority ancient or modern  W c H H H Cromp J P b Owen Possibly however lord Coke meant to con∣fine the disability of imprisoning to offences presented and punishable in the Leet which except in the case of bakers c can only be punished by amerciament The reason whereof is that this Court was established long before imprisonment was adopted as a mode of punishment And indeed how far any other court was authorised to inflict it by the com∣mon law might have been once a question  These errors are pro∣bably owing to the imperfect knowlege judges and law∣yers are content to acquire upon certain uprofitable sub∣jects "From Magna Charta to this time" says the  ate illustrious chief Courts Leet "have been  always abridged never enlarged  Burr  " It is an incontestable fact that the jurisdiction of the Leet has been  enlarged by several statutes  and was  never abridged by one  It was the same great character who decided in opposition to the united authority of ages see before p xi or rather to the law itself that a presentment in the Leet of a common offence is liable to be traversed But in short it seems to have been the leading principle of his long life and continuance on the bench to unsettle that law of which the chief and too often the only merit is its certainty    PRESENT STATE  IV Though the Leet from being principal cri∣minal court in the kingdom is now considered as the  owest the greater part of its business having been trans∣fered to other more extended jurisdictions yet it must not be supposed that the power and authority of the court is thereby diminished and gone On the contrary there is no offence which it ever did or could enquire of and  punish which it may not equally enquire of and punish at this day That the tourn and the leet have been so long in a declining way is not however at all owing to the cause refered to by a learned writer  Black Com    i e  the dis∣charge granted by the statute of Marlbridge in which by the way the Leet is not mentioned to all prelates peers and clergymen from their attendance on these courts since the county court and court baron which they are still com∣pellable to attend at least by attorney are scarcely in a more flourishing condition Neither is it perfectly clear that "experience has shewn the wisdom of widening the circle of both civil and criminal jurisdiction"  Burr  Changes may be for the worse as well as for the better True it is that the business of the Leet hath for the most part gra∣dually devolved upon the quarter sessions  Black Com  but many reasons may be given for this circumstance much more plausible than those already mentioned In the first place the increased population and more commercial turn of the country and the consequent increase of offenders and of∣fences required the dispensaries of justice to be if not always at least frequently open whereas the Leet is seldom held more than twice and sometimes but once in the year though it may certainly be kept open by ad∣journment from month to month from week to week or even from day to day Secondly the jurisdiction of this court is upon whatever principle confined to offences at the common law which are become less numerous than those created by act of parliament A third reason may be the Steward of a Leet seldom resides upon the spot justices of peace on the contrary are every where to be  met with and by keeping in a manner open shop make their profession and powers familiar to the people who love to buy law one would think as they do any other commodity The learned commentator is therefor in the right where he reckons "the almost entire disuse and contempt of the courtleet and sheriffstourn the kings ancient courts of common law formerly" he observes "much revered and respected" among the mischievous effects of the change in the administration of justice by  ummary proceedings before justices of the peace  Black Com  a change which as it places the liberty and property of the subject in the power of a single too often an insolent and oppressive and not unfrequently an interested and corrupt man  It is a notorious fact that many of these gentlemen particularly in and about the metropolis act solely for the sake of the emoluments of their office whence the odious appellation of  trading justices  And though they are sworn to send the fines c that happen before them to  he Exchequer for which in certain cases other funds have been su  sti∣  ted by act of parliament it appears from a late enquiry that some of  hem at least think it better policy to put what they get into their own  ockets but one can never believe that men  so very honorable  keep in pay  gang of vile informers much less that they will now and then convict  n innocent man for the sake of the penalty His Majestys Attorney Ge∣neral should look a little into this business which he undoubtedly will  oif he be well paid for it  as it is destructive of trial  per pares  Trial per pares  by ones equals is not only a more ancient but a  o  e proper phrase than  trial by Jury  as it is by no means necessary in  ompliance with a relique whether of Christian or of Pagan superstition  at men should either in this or in any other case  e  upon oath  The  i  ors of the Court Baron like the Peers in Parliament are never sworn  and only favorable to a system of tyranny and arbitrary power cannot be sufficiently reprobated  To the circumstances already noticed may be added the practice adopted in the quarter sessions and other superior courts of allowing and trying a traverse to the Grand Jurys presentment  In cases of  felony  the party is upon his plea of  not guilty  instantly put upon his trial In  misdemeanors  he is required to find surety for trying his traverse at the next sessions at his own expence the consequence  which is that if he have neither money nor friends he must remain in j  untryed and is of course in a much worse situation than the more heino  offender The editor has on such an occasion known the worshipful be  persuade the defendant to retract his plea and confess himself GUILTY and thus enable them to inflict what some might conceive under such cir∣cumstances a not very slight or trifling punishment for what in fact was  an indictable matter But then they got rid of an aukward business and such sort of people are seldom known to complain and much seldomer to obtain redress It is indeed frequently an object to be convicted since even the  honour  of an  acquittal  as Mr Bearcroft told the jury in  Steward  v  Powler  K B Sittings after M T had cost his client a  p  ¦porter  no less than  eight pounds  The trial of  Mr Hastings  let the eve  be what it will is expected to cost him not less than  one hundred thousand▪  a proceeding to which whethe  it be good or bad the primitive constitution of the coun∣try is an utter and total stranger It gives occasion how∣ever to a number of offices a long list of fees and af∣fords employment to a multitute of lawyers and attorneys a description of men unknown to the tourn or leet on  may add also in former times to the country court an  court baron and consequently to the ancient law which was too simple to need their interference and possibly too just to suffer it  If the excellence of municipal law consist in the number and ad∣vantages of those who make it a profession then undoubtedly the mo  voluminous obscure perplexed unintelligible and inconsistent it is the more in short matter is sacrificed to form and simplicity to complexed¦ness the nearer it will approach to perfection a point to which English jurisprudence seems in a fair way to arrive "Happy the nation"  claims the enlightened Beccaria "where the knowlege of the law is not science" Where the people not "being ignorant of the consequences of their own actions" do not "become necess  ly dependent on a few who are the interpreters of the laws which instead of being public and general are thus rendered private and particular"  The proceedings in the Lee  are without expence the suitor pays no fees and advo∣cates or attorneys of course never enter it A publicspirited prosecutor cannot here be at a charge of forty or fifty pounds to get an offender in whose punishment he is no more concerned than any other member of society fined so many shillings or perhaps pence  It is the practice of the Court of Kings Bench and thence of the Judges of Oyer and Terminer and ja  ldelivery and of the court of Quarter Sessions to assess an  arbitrary Fine  upon persons convicted of certain offences in those courts and compel the payment thereof upon pa  n of  mprisonment for li  e which in fact is frequently the consequence How far such a practice is reconcileable to the libe  ty of the subject to the principles of the constitution to the law of the land and in particular to  he th chapter of MAGNA CHARTA is submitted to the honorable and worshipful magistrates concerned See also Black Com In the mean time it seems of very little importance when contending with the Crown by whom a man is tryed if the measure of his punishment is to  e le  t to the DISCRETION of the  Kings ministers  This is obvious in  lmost every thing that comes in a criminal way before a certain court of which the judges seem as glad to get a culp  it into their clutches as the  urr'd law cats of Rabelais  Personne n'eschappe de cea  s sans y laiss  du  til or ça ou de la peau le plus souvent or ça  Pantagruel  l    c    nor will one of a different disposition find in this court an oppor∣tunity of gratifying his malice The punishment of the guilty is not aggravated nor the acquittal of the innocent purchased by the payment of heavy costs or court fees Twentythree men do not here upon their oath find a man guilty of an offence of which twelve others likewise upon their oath immediately afterward acquit him nor do those who are sworn to enquire with diligence and present the truth refuse to hear half the evidence In fine public justice is not in this court sacrificed to private  lucre nor a criminal process turned into an action fo  damages  See Black Com  NB  All the references to this wor  are to the vo edition of  The reader must not from any thing here suggested collect an opini  that a man should be hanged upon the secret enquiry and ba  e presentment of a Grand Jury The evidence ought in all cases to be publicly take  and as well for the accused as for the crown See Hale P C St  Trials iv Add to this that to put a man to death by form  law for any c  me or upon any pretence whatever is nothing more or  than a cool and deliberate MURDER which no necessity can require and which an irrational prejudice in favour of ancient barbarism a cal  magistracy and an indolent unfeeling legislature will never justify Th  magistrate indeed hardened as he is may be in some measure excusable since he studies in a school where even murder will appear an act of gen∣tleness and humanity when contrasted with the more than savage barbarit  of a system he is taught to admire as the perfection of human jurispru∣dence In HIGH TREASON this mildest and most boasted of crimi  codes adjudges a virtuous perhaps and most amiable characterwh  has offended no moral or social dutywho has been guilty only of ad∣hering with a laudable fidelity to the cause of an unfortunate sovereign of prefering at the worst the title of a tyrant

their opinions and not their actions See the "Memoirs of Mis∣sionary Priests" c a curious work which every one who wishes to form a perfect idea of the charitable and tolerating disposition of the govern∣ment law and church of England would do well to peruse He will there find that our pious Protestant ancestors understood the use of torture  as well as an Inquisitor General or Amboyna Dutchman  to be drawnoriginally naked with his feet tyed to a horses tailafterward on an oxes hideand lastly it may be curio  to remark the progress of judicial compassion on a hurdle or sledge  Cuthbert Maine a priest "was to be drawn a quarter of a mile to  he place of execution and when he was to be lay'd on the  sledge s  m of  he justices  moved the she  iffs deputy that he would cause him to have his head lay'd over the ca  e  that he might be dashed against the stones in drawing  " These good Christians upright magistrates and loyal subjects doubtless thought this ingenious contrivance would be as acceptable to God as they knew it would be agreeable to the judges and the Queen  to the place of execution there to be hanged by the neck but not till he is deadno that would be cruelhe is to be cut down alive  In Caxtons Chronicle c is an instance of a pardon granted to five traitors after they were hanged and cut down  his privy members cut off and his heart and bowels ripped out and thrown into the fire before his face then his head is to be cut off and his body divided into four quarters which are to be  at the Kings disposal  The execrable grant who first devised ordained or pe  mitted this horrid butchery  ou  d probably eat them rawAnd yet we talk of the HURONSBut a grant is not to be sat  ated even with blood nor appeased by the immola∣  ation of agonizing vict  ms he adds the basest rapine to the most atro∣  ious murder s  izes the dowry of the disconsolate widow the patrimony of the helpless orphan and devotes to ages of misery the innocent and the  nborn In PETTY TREASONfrom a refined attention to the delicacy of the fair s  x a woman is only to be burnt aliveof late indeed the  manity of the executioner  of the  common hangman  has been proof against the bar  a  ous insensibility of the legislature and  at the risque of  is own life  she is p  eviously strangled  This punishment has been altered to hanging since these pages were prepared  or the press See G c  And yet the authors of the Bill of Rights so undeservedly applauded thought it necessary to protest against "new and unusual punishments" as if the most diabolical imagina∣  ion could suggest any equal to those already established  At this time too there existed a species of torture equal if not superior  n point of cruelty to any practised in the Inquisitionand in one respect  t least much worse since it only terminated with the death of the mi∣  erable sufferer This was the  peine fo  t et dure  by which a prisoner who in order to secure his little property to his family refused to plead was gradually pressed to death in a dungeon by heavy weights upon h  beast his only sustenance in the mean timethat is during two or three daysfor so long have some unhappy wretches supported this excruciati  rmentbeing the foul and loathsome water which the place afforded  y way of prologue or preface to this torture the judges had a pleasant  actice of tying the culprits hands together with whipcordand while  e wretch fainted with agony and the blood spouted from his fingers  ould coolly order him away to consider how he should like something  orse All this in the great mercy of the legislature has been lately  anged to  immediate death  Punishment is only necessary or justifiable so far as it is beneficial to the community it induces the prevention of crimes and the reformation of the crim  that of death in itself a crime however ins  icted answers neither p  ∣pose confounds all degrees of criminality and makes no difference be∣tween a man and a wolf "Is it not absurd"they are the words of  humane and philosophic Beccaria"Is it not absurd" says he "  the laws which detest and punish homicide should▪ in order to preve  murder publicly commit murder themselves What must men th  when they see wise magistrates and grave ministers of justice with ind  ∣ference and tranquility dragging a criminal to death and whilst a wre  trembles with agony expecting the fatal stroke the judge who has con∣demned him with the coldest insensibility and perhaps with no sm  gratification from the exertion of his authority quits his tribunal to enjoy the comforts and pleasures of life"  The hungry judges soon the sentence sign  And wretches hang that jurymen may dine  It is not however to prevent murder alone that the law of England com∣mits it since according to Sir William Blackstone its express panegyn  "among the variety of actions which men are daily liable to commit  less than an HUNDRED AND SIXTY have been declared by act of parliament to be felonies without benefit of clergy or in other words to be worthy of instant death So dreadful a list" he adds "instead of diminishing increases the number of offenders" Com This "dreaful list" since considerably augmented and every session continues to produce law breathing the spirit of Draco and written in letters of bloodTo return All that is here contended for is that the Grand Jury so called under proper regulations appears to be the most constitutional mode of tri  and as favorable in every respect to the innocence of the accused as the petty jury than which in regard to the unanimity required from exactly twelve men upon oath nothing can be more absurd nor have a mo  obvious tendency to perjury and injustice The only difficulty seems to be in the form or manner of the accusation which in fact is all that the finding of the Grand Jury now serves for a difficulty which were this  proper place for further discussion would not prove insurmountable    The peculiar excellence of this most ancient and re∣spectable tribunal is that it does what is usually called every bodys business and nobodys business The juro  are to enquire of such offences or disorders as may happen within their own neighbourhood under their own obser∣vation  in order that if they cannot be avoided by timely interference an adequate penalty may prevent their rep  ∣  tion  They are to be themselves vigilant to see with  eir own eyes to hear with their own ears and if the evidence of others should as it may sometimes in offences  lready committed happen to be necessary to receive it  partially  Much of this can only be understood of those courts in which it is  e custom to swear the jury in for the year where they are discharged  e same day it should seem necessary for them to proceed chiefly upon  vidence and indeed there is generally if not always a proclamation  or that purpose  A jurisdiction of which the end is jus∣  ce will abhor the use of baseness in the means to attain  this of which we are now speaking affords neither  ncouragement nor countenance to a common informer  ho seems to be to Law what the jackall is said to be to  e Liona servile and dependent monster employed to  scover and hunt down the prey of an indolent and vora∣  ous tyrant  To conclude Whether it be now too soonfor it  eems impossible that the day should never arrive when  he people at large will be convinced that even what is  alled law may be unjust tyrannical and oppressive and  hat it is essential to their happiness to have justice admi∣  istered in its utmost simplicity free of expence and as  ear as possible to their own doorsBut whether it be  oo soon or too late to expect that the Leet however  enerable for its antiquity honorable for its constitutional  rigin excellent in its institution and useful in its effects  should ever recover its ancient influence and extende  jurisdictionunless by a remedy which might prove eve  worse than the diseasethe introduction of fees pleading lawyers and attorneysit is at the same time much  be desired that the exercise of those powers which it  still retained and which apply to the punishment and pre∣vention of such offences as being the most frequent a  possibly the most generally injurious or at least vexa∣tious may be enforced with vigour and efficacy and society thereby receive a benefit which is only undervalue perhaps because it is not paid for and its source too litt  beholden to distance and mysteryqualitys it would seen equally necessary to ensure reverence to Religion and  Law  THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTLEET  c  I CRIMES

refusing so to do for which they were amerced  l  each"  {inverted ⁂} This amerciament was affeered but without necessity as the constables by neglect and refusal had  ipso facto  incurred the pain set at the for∣mer court which would have been good without affeerment  Note That it appears from the above order that the ancient custom was that the constable of each ward should be a person

Quitting the Liberty  M C "At this court it was found by the jury that Joseph Wright sworn constable for the Royal Ward is removed out of the said mannor and liberty whereupon Thomas Ricketts being presented by the said jury as a proper person to serve the said office for the remainder of the year was elected by the steward and sworn in accordingly"  M C Two similar entries  Substitute  The practice of swearing in substitute constables is of late years become so common as even to be re∣garded as a matter of course The difference be∣tween an  assistant  a  deputy  and a  substitute  seems to be that in the two former cases the principal is responsible in the latter case he is discharged But  quaere  See  Assistant  Usurping the Office  E C Robert Evans "for takeing upon him the office of a constable and exerciseing the same with∣out the leave of this court" amerced  s  reduced to  s  See  Disorderly Houses  Contempts  Departing without Leave  E C John Ashley for "apearing at this court and in contempt therof departing without lycence" fined  The difference between a fine and amerciament is that the former is the sole act of the court the latter must be grounded upon the presentments of the jury and must likewise be affeered  i e  ascertained or reduced to certainty by indifferent persons sworn for that purpose and who are generally but not necessarily taken out of the jury See E C and instances of the affeerers not being jurymen It seems requisite however that they should be ac∣quainted with the nature of the offence in respect whereof the amercia∣ment is imposed A fine on the contrary needs no affeerment being imposed by the steward as judge for offences committed within his own view or the defaults of the officers of the court A fine on an officer is likewise called an amerciament or amerciament royal but does not on that account require any affeering Unless therefor John Ashley was in office this fine was illegal  Till the year M C the amerciaments were always set by the jury in their presentments at an express sum which was afterward affeered But this practice being thought irregular was then altered upon due deliberation and good advice so that then and thencefor∣ward the amerciament was and has been set by the court indefinitely "and therefor he is amerced" answering to the  Ideo ipse in misericordia  of the old precedents and afterward affeered at a precise sum It should be noticed however that some instances have been since discovered where an amerciament is set upon the presentments of the aleconners c in the very language now adopted "and therefore he is amerced" which may induce one to believe that it is but a re∣storation of the ancient practice See E C M C and E C    s  Misbehaviour  E C John Willson "for

the custom of which there is similar evi∣dence at almost every court down to the year  See the  Special Entries  Summoned upon Pain  E C Six persons "being summoned vpon paine to bee chosen into an office for having made default" amerced  l  apiece  E C Four persons "for not apearing at this court being sumoned upone paine of fiue pounds" amerced  l  apiece  E C Ten persons amerced for default  l  each Note These amerciaments occur almost every Easter Court down to the present time and this amerciament being the "pain" intended by the summons it does not seem to be in power of the affeerers either to mitigate or to increase it  From the preceding entry in it may be conjectured that the pain was formerly specified in the summons in this case affeer∣ment was certainly superfluou  and

put any inhabitant into any of the ward offices in less then three years clear from their haveing served any one ward office as alsoe not to putt any inhabitant on any office till he has been an inhabitant for full three years in the liberty but notwithstanding that this has been observed by several jurys yet for want of its being inserted in the jurys book the said rule has very offten been broke into to the detriment and very great hardship of several of the inhabitants aforesaid several of which have very often been put into two offices within the space of or years at most while great numbers of the other inhabi∣tants of the said liberty have escaped from serving any one office at all for or years To remedy this hardship therefore we doe here leave it as our oppinion and judgment and as a very great peice of justice doe recom∣mend it to all suceeding jurys That it the time of their chooseing the officers and jury to succeed them that they  would take the trouble carefully to over look this book and only to put in such as have enjoyed three clear years besides the year they were in any office the jury alsoe recommend it farther to their successors to cause this said representation or some other such as in their judgment will answer the purpose designed in writeing at the end of their years account in this book for the good and just advantage not of themselves

end of the New Church which stood till the year when being looked upon as an unsightly object by virtue of an order of the Duchy court and with the consent of the burgesses it was taken down and by

beginning at the southwest corner of TempleBar and  from thence 'goeth' along by the wall of the Middle Temple on the south and from thence 'extending' west∣ward and thence again towards the south as the said wall goes along to the river passing by a boundary stone with the mark of an anchor thereon till it falls into the River of Thames and from thence 'extending' along by the said river westward by several wharfs on the bank of the said river till it comes to Milford Lane and thence northward up the middle of the said lane comprehending the buildings on the east side thereof till it shoots out into the Strand and from thence stretching over towards the northwest till it comes to the southwest corner of Saint Clements Church and from thence passing by the west door of the said church till it comes by the corner of a row of houses on the north side of the churchyard comprehending the said houses and going though a passage there to the middle of a street 'called the Backside of' St Clements and from thence extending eastward through the middle of Butcher Row by the kennel there till it comes opposite to the Ship Tavern just beyond the east end of the Butcher Row and from thence crossing over the way as the kennel now goes to the southward opposite to Cross Keys Court till it comes to the kennel next without the footway there and from thence going eastward to TempleBar where it first began  The MIDDLEWARD begins at the kennel on the north side of the Strand without the footway there opposite to Milford Lane and from thence extending down by the middle of the said lane to the River Thames being bound∣ed all the way on the east side by the Royal  W  ard before described and extending from the bottom of Milford Lane  all along by the River Thames as the said river runs to∣wards the northwest till it comes to Strand Bridge Stairs including the same and from thence turning northward up Strand Bridge Lane by the wall of Somerset House garden and Somerset House the boundary towards the west till it comes into that part of the highway called the Strand where the kennel runs without the footway on the north side of the said highway and then turning east∣ward from that part of the said kennel which is opposite to the northeast corner of the front buildings in Somerset House all long by the said kennel till it comes opposite to Milford Lane where the boundary first began  The SAVOYWARD begins at the northeast cor∣ner of the buildings in the front of Somerset House in the Strand and from thence extending by the wall or boundary of Somerset House and garden to the River of Thames be∣ing bounded all the way on the east side of the MiddleWard before described until it comes to Strand Bridge and from thence extending all along by the River of Thames as the said river runs to the northwest till it comes to a stone marked with an anchor in the wall next the river at the bottom of Cecil Street  and from thence extending in the same manner till it comes to Ivy Bridge and from thence comprehending the said bridge turning northward all along by Durham Yard within the liberty of Westminster the boundary towards the west end of the Duchy Liberty till it comes into the middle of the high street called the Strand comprehending the buildings described in the map to be the ancient scite of Salisbury House and from the middle of the high street opposite to Ivy Bridge  And the said jurors on their oaths aforesaid do further say and present that it appears to them by authentic copiers of two several surveys of the sand man  or liberty duly proved and given in evidence on this  quisition that is to say one a copy of a survey or return of a commission under seal of the said Duchy of Lancaster and remaining of record in the Duchy Office for bounding her then ma∣jesty's manor of the Savoy beating date the sixth day of February in the fortyfourth year of the reign of queen Elizabeth and the other a copy of a survey taken by ordinance of parliament in the year remaining of record in the Augmentation office that the bounds of the said manor liberty or franchise at the respective times of taking the said several surveys did extend towards the west to the middle of Ivy Lane opposite to Ivy Bridge and therefore the said jurors no contrary evidence having been given to them on their oaths aforesaid do say and present that the boundary of the said manor and liberty ought not to terminate to the westward at the middle of Cecil Street but ought to extend opposite the middle of Ivy Lane aforesaid according to the surveys aforesaid and as in the map or plan herein before mentioned is expressed and declared"  This inquisition is in many respects an admirable record and the plan very accurately and neatly delineated The jurors however were undoubtedly misled by the survey of Eliz for in fact there is no mention of Ivy Lane in that of Whether there were any blame in not enquiring more minutely into a matter so important as evey this is which men have to deliver upon oath as a guide to posterity and upon whom it ought to fall we cannot well say But the reason and cause of this serious mistake was in truth as follows Soon after the th Eliz which was the year being the last of her reign the ancient lane called Ivy Lane or Ivy Bridge Lane was by virtue of a grant under the Duchy seal and of a writ of  ad quod dumnam  and an inquisition thereon taken away or blocked up by Sir Robert Cecil afterward Earl of Salisbury who in lieu thereof opened a new lane or passage from the Strand to the river on the west side of his house which retained the old name of Ivy Lane as a bridge at the bottom of it did that of Ivy Bridge  The ancient bridge was of a very different nature Both Ivy Lane and Strand Lane were originally low subterraneous passages somewhat resembling it is thought the present arched cartways to the Adelphi wharfs the bridges themselves being in the high street  Vide  Stows Survey by Strype  ic c It is wonderful that the translation of Ivy Lane should have escaped the re∣searches of this industrious edito  S  e works was originally published in  This proceeding which was confirmed by a private act of parliament in the d year of K James I could not however affect the boundary of the liberty and as the middle of Cecil Street has ever since it was made been looked upon and perambulated as the west boundary it seems highly probable that the middle of this street is the identical ground which at the time of taking the survey of the th Eliz was the middle of Ivy Lane Instead therefore of the words in italies we ought to read the following  and from thence turning directly northward up the middle of Cecil Street the boundary towards the west end of the Duchy liberty till it comes into the middle of the high street called the Strand and from the middle of the high street opposite to the middle of Cecil Street  extending eastward till  it comes opposite to the middle of Burleigh Street near Exeter Change and from thence extending up the middle of Burleigh Street till it comes to a corner extending  towards the northeast to the corner of a building about eighty foot in length near which is placed in the front the mark of an anchor and from thence going on by the ancient scite of Burleigh House on the northeast side thereof till it comes to the north side of a house fiftyfive foot distant from the front thereof now in the Strand in the possession of Mrs Nicholson pewterer and from thence proceeding on to the kennel on the north side of the Strand next without the footway there eighteen foot or thereabouts distant from the front buildings there and from thence extending to the eastward along by the said kennel leaving the church of Saint Mary le Strand on the south till it comes a little beyond the east end of the said church and from thence stretching over as the said kennel in part goes to the middle of the highway called the Strand opposite to the northeast corner of the front buildings of Somerset House on the northwest end of Strand Bridge Lane where the boundary first began  The CHURCHWARD begins a small distance from the end of Holywell Street and from thence extending southward to the highway called the Strand till it comes to the boundary of the Middle Ward almost opposite to Strand Bridge Lane being bounded towards the west by part of the end of the Savoy Ward before described and from thence extending eastward along the said highway called the Strand being bounded towards the south by the Middle Ward before described till it comes almost op∣posite to the end of Milford Lane and from thence stretching northward and northeastward near the corner of Saint Clements Church being bounded towards the east by the Royal Ward before described and going through the passage from Saint Clements Churchyard near the said church till it falls into the kennel in the middle of the said street called the Backside of Saint Clements and from thence extending towards the west all along by the kennel in the middle of Holywell Street comprehending the buildings on the south side of the said street till it falls into a cross kennel towards the west end of the said street where the boundary first began  FINIS
