 Edward  and  Eleonora  A TRAGEDY As it was to have been Acted at the THEATREROYAL IN  COVENTGARDEN    By Mr  THOMSON  Suspicione si quis errabit suâ  Et rapiet ad se quod erit commune omnium  Stulte nudabit Animi Conscientiam  PHAEDRUS  LONDON  Printed for the AUTHOR and sold by A MILLAR overagainst St  Clement's  Church in the  Strand  MDCCXXXIX  TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE Princess of  Wales  MADAM  IF I take the Liberty once more to crave the Protection of your ROYAL HIGHNESS for another Tragedy of my writing it is because I am led almost unavoidably to it by my Subject In the Character of ELEONORA I have endeavoured to represent however faintly a PRINCESS distinguish'd for all the Virtues that render Greatness  amiable I have aimed particularly to do justice to her inviolable Affection and generous Tenderness for a PRINCE who was the Darling of a great and free People  Their Descendants even now will own with Pleasure how properly this Address is made to your ROYAL HIGHNESS I am with the profoundest Respect  MADAM    Your  ROYAL HIGHNESS'S  most humble and most devoted Servant  JAMES THOMSON  PROLOGUE  By a FRIEND  IN former Times when fierce religious Rage  And priestly Sway deform'd each suffering Age  All manly Wit all useful Learning lay  In Darkness lost nor hop'd returning Day  Religion then was stain'd by cruel Deeds  And freeborn Reason stoop'd to Craft and Creeds  But happier WeAnd tho' tonight we show  What fatal Ills from blind Devotion flow  'Tis not that we such Rage renew'd can fear  Or dread the Hand of Persecution here  Our Scene would wide Humanity impart  Would breathe extensive Candour thro' the Heart  Show true Religion even to Error kind  And claim the perfect Freedom of the Mind  If too the Poet paints a noble Strife  'Twixt the fond Husband and the generous Wife  If all the Father in  his  Voice complains  And all the Mother in  her  tender Strains  If these best Passions prompt the pleasing Woe  Indulge it freelyNature bids it flow  Where Parent Nature leads you cannot stray  And what she wills 'tis Virtue to obey  Fond of  BRITANNIA  's Fame and just to  YOU    He bids  old English Honour  live anew  And calls your great first  EDWARD  up to view  But if his Line too weak his Stroke too faint  The graceful Figure in full Light to paint  In candid part his honest Meaning take  And spare the Poet for the Hero's sake  EPILOGUE  By a FRIEND  THese Poets are such FoolsThe Man behind  Who wrote this Playa simple Soul I find  Believes with all his Heart there was a Wife  Who needs would dieto save a Husband's Life  He in the printed Chronicles has read it  And true it isSir  Richard Baker  said it  Why what an Ass these Books do make a Man  Read Naturethen believe ityou who can  Look round this Townthe question is notwhether  Spouse  dies  for Spouse but who will  live  together  Of old they say a Husband was a Lover  But thank our Stars these foolish Days are over  To such substantial Prudence are we come  We wed not Heart to Heartbut Plumb to Plumb  What Sense what Beauty are not now the Things  But can  he  settle  up  to what  she  brings  Yet in this easy allforgiving Age  Bear with such moral Foolerieson the Stage  Perhaps too there may be some gentle Soul  Who rather likes to weepthan win a Vole  Who thinks that there  are  Charms in generous Love  And would to  Edward Eleonora  prove  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Representation of this Tragedy on the Stage was prohibited in the Year  One Thousand Seven Hundred and ThirtyNine  The PERSONS  EDWARD Prince of  England  Mr DELANE  Earl of

 SCENE  EDWARD  'S Tent in the Camp before  Jaffa  a City on the Coast of  Palestine  Edward  and  Eleonora    A TRAGEDY  ACT I SCENE I  Prince  EDWARD    THEALD  Archdeacon of  Liege  Earl of  GLOSTER  EDWARD  I Will no longer doubt 'Tis plain my Friends  That with our little Band of  English  Troops  By all Allies all western Powers deserted  All but the noble Knights that guard this Land  The Flower of  Europe  and of Christian Valour  Nought can be done nought worthy of our Cause  Worthy of  England  's Heir and of the Name  Of  Lionhearted  RICHARD whose Renown  After almost a Century elaps'd  Shakes thro' its wide Extent this Eastern World  What else could bend the  Saracen  to Peace  Who might with better Policy refuse  To grant it us Yes to the Prince of  Jaffa  I will accord the Peace he has demanded  And tho' my Troops impatient wait the Signal  To storm yon Walls yet will I not expose  In vain Attempts Valour that should be sav'd  For better days and for the public Welfare  Rash fruitless War from wanton Glory wag'd  Is only splendid MurderWhat says THEALD  Approves my Reverend Father of my Purpose  THEALD  EDWARD illustrious Heir of  England  's Crown  I must indeed be blinded with the Zeal  Of this our holy Cause to think your Arms  Thus allforsaken thus betray'd sufficient  To reach the Grandeur of your first Design  And from the Yoke of Infidels to free  The sacred City Object of our Vows  Yet this methinks this  Jaffa  might be seiz'd  That still were something an auspicious Omen  Of future ConquestBut unskill'd in War  To you my Lord and GLOSTER'S wise Experience  I this submit  EDWARD  Speak GLOSTER your Advice  Before I fix my latest Resolution  GLOSTER  You know my Lord I never was a Friend  To this Crusado My unchang'd Advice  Is strenuous then for Peace Nor this alone  From your deserted Circumstance I urge  But from the state of our unhappy Country  Behold her EDWARD with a filial Eye  And say is this a time for these Adventures  Behold Her still with deep Commotion shook  Beneath a false delusive Face of Quiet  Behold Her bleeding still from Civil War  Exhausted sunk drain'd by ten thousand Arts  Of ministerial Rapine endless Taxes  Illmanag'd Expeditions Strangers Legates  Italian  Leeches and insatiate  Rome    That never rag'd before with such gross Insult  With such abandon'd Avarice Besides  Who knows what evil Counsellors again  Are gather'd round the Throne In Times like these  Disturb'd and lowring with unsettled Freedom  One step to lawless Power one old Attempt  Renew'd the least Infringement of our Charters  Would hurl the giddy Nation into Tempest  Return my Prince You have already sav'd  Your Father from his Foes from haughty LEISTER  Now save him from his Ministers from those  Who hold him captive in the worst of Chains  EDWARD  You GLOSTER sav'd us both  GLOSTER  I did my Duty  Even while I join'd with LEISTER did my Duty  I hope I didHe who contends for Freedom  Can ne'er be justly deem'd his Sovereign's Foe  No 'tis the Wretch that tempts him to subvert it  The soothing Slave the Traitor in the bosom  Who best deserves that Name he is the Worm  That eats out all the Happiness of Kingdoms  EDWARD return lose not a Day an Hour  Before this City Tho' your Cause be holy  Believe me 'tis a much more pious Office  To save your Father's old and broken Years  His mild and easy Temper from the Snares  Of low corrupt insinuating Traitors  A nobler Office far on the firm Base  Of wellproportion'd Liberty to build  The common Quiet Happiness and Glory  Of King and People  England  's rising Grandeur  To you my Prince this Task of right belongs  Has not the Royal Heir a juster Claim  To share his Father's inmost Heart and Counsels  Than Aliens to his Int'rest those who make  A Property a Market of his Honour  One Reason more allow me to suggest  For Peace immediate Peaceshould blind Misfortune  In this fardistant hostile Land oppress us  A Chance to which our Weakness stands expos'd  What EDWARD of thy Princess would become  Thy ELEONORA she whose tender Love  Thro' stormy Seas and in fierce Camps attends thee  What of thy blooming Offspring charg'd with these  To give our Courage scope were cruel Rashness  EDWARD  Enough my Lord I stand resolv'd on Peace  And will to  England  straitBut where alas  Where shall we cover our inglorious Heads  When gay with Hope the People round us press  To hear by what Exploits we have sustain'd  The Fame of RICHARD and of  English  Valour  Shall I my generous Country I be rank'd  With those weak Princes who consume thy Wealth  And sink thy Name in idle Expeditions  Perfidious  France  Be this the ruling Point  Of my whole Life the Passion of my Soul  To humble thee proud NationMeantime GLOSTER  See that the captive Princess be restor'd  DARAXA to the Sultan of this City  Whose Bride she isWe wage not war with Women  SCENE II  EDWARD    THEALD    GLOSTER  An Officer belonging to the Prince  OFFICER  One from the Prince of  Jaffa  Sir demands  Your secret Ear on some important Message  EDWARD  Conduct him to my Tent  Officer goes out  He brings I judge  The Sultan's last Instructions for this Peace  Here wait I may your faithful Counsel want  SCENE III  THEALD    GLOSTER    THEALD  Whatever Woes of late have clouded  England    Yet must I GLOSTER call that Nation happy  On whose Horizon smiles a dawning Prince  Of EDWARD'S Worth and Virtues  GLOSTER  True my Friend  EDWARD has great has amiable Virtues  That Virtue chiefly which befits a Prince  He loves the People he must one day rule  With Fondness loves them with a noble Pride  Esteems their Good esteems their Glory his  One Instance it becomes me to recount  That shows the genuine Greatness of his Soul  Tho' I have met him in the bloody Field  He fighting for his Father I for Freedom  Yet bears his Bosom no remaining Grudge  Of those distracted Times to me his Heart  Is greatly reconcil'dVirtue beyond  The little unforgiving Soul of Tyrants  Now will I tell thee THEALD whence I stoop  To wear the gaudy Chains of CourtAttendance  At these grey Years that should in calm Retirement  Pass the soft Evening of a bustling Life  And plume my parting Soul for better Worlds  Amidst his many Virtues youthful EDWARD  Is lofty warm and absolute of Temper  I therefore seek to moderate his Heat  To guide his fiery Virtues that misled  By dazling Power and flattering Sycophants  Might finish what his Father's weaker Measures  Have try'd in vain And hence I here attend him  In Expeditions which I ne'er approv'd  In holy Warsyour Pardon Reverend Father  I must declare I think such Wars the Fruit  Of idle Courage or mistaken Zeal  Sometimes of Rapine and religious Rage  To every Mischief prompt  THEALD  You wrong my Lord  You wrong them much To set this Matter only  Upon a Civil Footing say what Right  Had Robbers rushing from  Arabian  Desarts  Fierce as the Suns that kindled up their Rage  Thus in a barbarous Torrent to bear down  All  Asia    Africk  and profane their Altars  And to repel brute Force by Force is just  Nay does not even our Duty Int'rest Glory  The common Honour of the Christian Name  Require us to repress their wild Ambition  That labours westward still and threatens  Europe  GLOSTER  Yes when they burst their Limits let us check them  And with a firmer hand than those loose Christians  The most corrupt and abject of Mankind  Slaves doubly Slaves who suffer'd these  Arabians    In Virtue their Superiors as in Valour  To measure Conquest with a Traveller's Speed  By Rage and Zeal 'tis true their Empire rose  But now some settled Ages of Possession  Create a Right than which I fear few Nations  Can shew a better Sure I am 'tis Madness  Inhuman Madness thus from half the World  To drain our Blood and Treasure to neglect  Each Art of Peace to set Mankind adrift  And all for what By spreading Desolation  Rapine and Slaughter o'er the other half  To gain a Conquest we can never hold  I venerate this Land Its sacred Hills  Its Vales its Cities trod by Saints and Prophets  By GOD himself the Scenes of heavenly Wonders  Inspire me with a certain awful Joy  But the same GOD my Friend pervades sustains  Surrounds and fills this universal Frame  And every Land where spreads his vital Presence  His allenlivening Breath to me is holy  Excuse me THEALD if I go too far  I meant alone to say I think these Wars  A kind of Persecution And when that  That most absurd and cruel of all Vices  Is once begun where shall it find an end  Each in his turn or has or claims a Right  To wield its Dagger to return its Furies  And first or last they fall upon our selves  EDWARD behind the Scenes  Inhuman Villain is thy Message Murder  THEALD  Ha heard you not the Prince exclaiming Murder  GLOSTER  Should this Barbarian Messenger  Moving towards the Noise  'Tis so  SCENE IV  THEALD    GLOSTER  to them Prince  EDWARD  wounded in the Arm and dragging in the Assassin  EDWARD  Detested Wretch And does the Prince of  Jaffa  Send base Assassins to transact his Treaties  Theretake thy Answer Ruffian  Stabs him with the Dagger he had wrested from him  Blow too hasty  I should have sav'd thee for a fitter Death  ASSASSIN  I would have triumph'd Christian in thy worst  For know thou vile Destroyer of the Faithful  That tho' my erring Dagger miss'd thy Heart  Yet has it fir'd thy Veins with mortal Poison  Whose very touch is DeathALLAH be prais'd  O glorious Fate Prophet receive my Soul  Dies  EDWARD after a short Pause  Why stare you pale Amazement on each other  Are we not Men to whom the various Chance  Of Life is known  GLOSTER  Ha Poison did he say  Then is at once my Prince and Country lost  O fatal Wound to  England  THEALD  Quick my Lord  Retire and have it drest without delay  Ere the fell Poison can diffuse its Rage  And deeply taint your Blood  EDWARD  The Princess comes  O save me from her Tenderness  SCENE V  EDWARD    THEALD    GLOSTER  to them the Princess  ELEONORA    ELEONORA  My EDWARD  Support meOh  EDWARD  She faintsMy ELEONORA  Look up and bless me with thy gentle Eyes  The Colour comes her Cheeks resume their Beauty  And all her Charms reviveHence spurn that Carcass  A Sight too shocking for my ELEONORA  ELEONORA  And lives my EDWARD lives my dearest Lord  From this Assassin sav'dAlas you bleed  EDWARD  'Tis nought my lovely PrincessA slight Wound  ELEONORA  But ah methought I entering heard of Poison  Tainting the BloodWhat was the Dagger poison'd  Ha ssilent all will none relieve my Fears  GLOSTER  Madam restrain your Tenderness a moment  The Prince delays too longLet him retire  Meanwhile the troubled Camp shall be my Care  Lest the base Foe should make a sudden Sally  While yet our Troops are stun'd with this Disaster  EDWARD  I thank thee noble GLOSTER Nor alone  Support my Troops go rouse them to Revenge  Tell them their injur'd Prince will try their Love  Their Valour soonAnd you my Friend good THEALD  Attend the PrincessChear thee ELEONORA  I cannot will not leave thee long to vex  Thy tender Soul with aggravated Fears  THEALD  Behold DARAXA the false Sultan's Bride  SCENE VI  ELEONORA    THEALD    DARAXA    DARAXA  Princess of  England  let me share thy Grief  Whence flow these Tears and what this wild Alarm  This Noise of Murder and Assassination  ELEONORA  Alas the Prince is wounded by a Ruffian  And with a poison'd Dagger as I fear  Yet none will ease me of this racking Thought  Nay tell me THEALD since to know the  Is oft a kind of miserable Comfort  What has befal'n the Prince For this slight Wound  Could never thus o'ercast the Brave with Terror  THEALD  I dare not Princess dally with your Fate  An impious Villain from the Sultan SELIM  Pretended to the Prince a secret Message  About the Peace in Treaty Dreading nought  He left us here and to his Tent retir'd  There to receive this execrable Envoy  Strait with the Prince alone the fierce Assassin  Attempted on his Life but in his Arm  He took it seems the Blow and from the Villain  Wresting the Dagger plung'd it to his Heart  This last we saw and heard th' inhuman Bigot  Who deem'd himself a Martyr in their Cause  Boast as he dy'd the Prince's Wound was poison'd  ELEONORA  Then all I fear'd is true then am I wretched  Beyond even Hope  DARAXA  A Villain from the Sultan  ELEONORA  Ah the distracting Thought And is my Life  My Love my EDWARD on the brink of Fate  Of Fate that may this moment snatch him from me  DARAXA  What SELIM send Assassins and beneath  A Name so sacred SELIM whose Renown  Is Incense breathing o'er the sweeten'd East  For each humane each generous Virtue fam'd  SELIM the Rock of Faith and Sun of Honour  ELEONORA  O complicated Woe The Christian Cause  Has now no more a Patron and Restorer  England  no more a Prince in whom she plac'd  Her Glory her Delight her only Hope  These desolated Troops no more a Chief  No more a Husband a Protector I  A Friend a Lover and my helpless Children  No more a Father  DARAXA  Pardon gentle Princess  If in this Whirlwind of revolving Passions  That snatch my Soul by turns I have forgot  To pay the Tribute which I owe thy Sorrows  But I my self alas am more unhappy  ELEONORA  What Woes can equal mine who lose thus vilely  The Best the Bravest Loveliest of Mankind  DARAXA  You lose the Lover I must learn to hate him  To scorn what once wasall my Pride and Transport  Should EDWARD die by this accursed Crime  Which Heaven forbid he dies admir'd belov'd  In the full Bloom of Fame and spotless Honour  To you the Daughter of illustrious Grief  Your Tears remain and sadlysweet Reflection  You with his Image with his Virtues still  Amidst the pensive Gloom may Converse hold  While IAh nothing meets my blasted Sight  But a black View of Infamy and Horror  What is the Loss of Life to Loss of Virtue  And yet how can this heavenly Spark be lost  No Virtue burns with an immortal Flame  He is bely'dsome Villain has abus'd him  THEALD  I honour Madam this your virtuous Grief  But that the Sultan did employ th'Assassin  Is past all doubtBehold the false Instructions  By which he gain'd Admittance  Giving her the Letter the Prince had dropt  DARAXA  Ha'Tis so  His Hand his SealFrom my detesting Heart  I tear him thus for everPerish SELIM  Perish the feeble Wretch who more bewails him  That were to share his GuiltUnhappy Princess  Now let me turn my Soul to thy Assistance  There is a Cure 'tis true  ELEONORA  A Cure DARAXA  O say what Cure  DARAXA  No it avails not Madam  None can be found to risque it  ELEONORA  None to risque it  Quick tell me what it is my dear DARAXA  DARAXA  To find some Person that with friendly Lip  May draw the Poison forth at least its Rage  And mortal Spirit This will bring the Wound  Within the Power of Art but certain Death  Attends the generous Deed  ELEONORA kneeling  Then hear me Heaven  Prime Source of Love Ye Saints and Angels hear me  I here devote me for the best of Men  Of Princes and of Husbands On this Cross  I seal the cordial Vow confirm it Heaven  And grant me Courage in the Hour of Trial  THEALD  O Tenderness unequal'd  DARAXA  Glorious Princess  ELEONORA  Go THEALD quickly find the Earl of GLOSTER  And with him break this matter to the Prince  As for the Person leave that Task to me  I with DARAXA will your Call attend  O all ye Powers of Love your Influence lend  End of the First ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  GLOSTER    THEALD    GLOSTER  NO THEALD no he never will consent  I know him wellhe ne'er will purchase Life  At such a Rate besides in aid of Love  His generous Pride would come and deem it Baseness  THEALD  Then is yon Sun his last The blackning Wound  Begins already to confess the Poison  Meantime my Lord both Friendship and our Duty  Demand at least the Trial Well I know  That poise his Life with hers he would as nothing  Esteem his own but sure the Life of Thousands  The mingled Cause at once of Heaven and Earth  Should o'er the best the dearest Life prevail  GLOSTER  Alas my Friend you reason EDWARD loves  How weak the Head contending with the Heart  Yet be the Trial madeBehold he comes  SCENE II  EDWARD    GLOSTER    THEALD    EDWARD entering  O

resplendent Orb of Day  To that dear Spot of Earth my last Farewel  And thee Eternal Providence whose Course  Amidst the various Maze of Life is fix'd  By boundless Wisdom and by boundless Love  I follow thee with Resignation Hope  With Confidence and Joy for thou art good  And of thy rising Goodness is no end  Well met my dearest FriendsIt was too true  The Villain's Threatning and I nearly touch  That awful Hour which every Man must prove  Yet every Man still shifts at distance from him  Come then and let us fill the Space between  These last important Moments whence we take  Our latest Tincture for Eternity  With solemn Converse and exalting Friendship  NayTHEALDGLOSTERwound me not with Tears  With Tears that fall o'er venerable Cheeks  What could the Princess moreAh there indeed  At every Thought of Her I feel a Weight  A dreadful Weight of Tenderness that shakes  My firmest ResolutionWhere is she  THEALD  She burns with fond Impatience to attend you  EDWARD  And how brave GLOSTER did you leave the Camp  GLOSTER  The Camp Sir is secure each Soldier there  From Indignation draws new Force and Spirit  O 'tis a glorious an affecting Sight  Those furrow'd Cheeks that never knew before  The Dew of Tears now in a copious Shower  Are bath'd Around your Tent they various croud  Rank over Rank some pressing for a Look  Some sadly musing with dejected Eye  Some on their Knees preserring Vows to Heaven  And with extended Arm some breathing Vengeance  " Base  Saracens  they cry perfidious Cowards  " But Blood shall wash out BloodAh poor Atonement  " Did the whole bleeding City fall a Victim  EDWARD  What unbought Love and generous Valour fire  The freeborn HeartYet moderate their Zeal  And let the Sword of Justice only strike  The faithless SELIM and his guilty Creatures  My newdeparted Spirit just escap'd  From the low fev'rish Passions of this Life  Would grieve to see the Blood of Innocence  With that of Guilt confounded stain my Tomb  THEALD  Permit me Sir the Hope that you your self  I speak it on just Causemay live to punish  This Breach of all the sacred Rights of Men  EDWARD  Why will you turn my Thoughts from Earth enlarg'd  To soft enfeebling Views of Life again  THEALD  Not to a vain Desire of Life my Lord  I would re  them but inspire each Hope  Advise each Possibility to save it  And there is yet a Remedy  EDWARD  Delusion  THEALD  The fair  Arabian  Princess mention'd one  EDWARD  She oneDARAXAsomething to compleat  Her Lover's Crime  THEALD  You could not wrong her thus  Had you beheld the Tempest of her Soul  Her Grief her Rage Confusion when she heard  Of SELIM'S Baseness had you seen that Honour  That glorious Fire that parted from her Eyes  'Till in a Flood of virtuous Sorrow sunk  She almost equal'd ELEONORA'S Tears  EDWARD  What was it she propos'd  THEALD  It was my Lord  To find some Person who with friendly Lip  Might draw the deadly Spirit  EDWARD  I have heard  Of such a Cure but is it not good THEALD  An Action fatal to the kind Performer  THEALD  Yes surely fatal  EDWARD  Name it then no more  I should despise the paltry Life it purchas'd  Besides what Mortal can dispose so rashly  Of his own Life Talk not of low Condition  And of my publick Rank when Life or Death  Becomes the Question all Distinctions vanish  Then the first Monarch and the lowest Slave  On the same Level stand in This the Sons  Of equal Nature all  THEALD  Allow me Sir  If 'tis a certain an establish'd Duty  Than Duty more the Height of human Virtue  To sacrifice a transitory Life  For that kind Source from whence it is deriv'd  And all its guarded Joys our dearest Country  To sacrifice it in the Cause of Heaven  Author of every Good by the same Reason  It may be justly sacrific'd for Those  On whom depends the Welfare of the Public  And there is one my Lord who stands devoted  By solemn and irrevocable Vows  To die for you  EDWARD  To die for meKind Nature  Thanks to thy forming Hand I can myself  Chearful sustain to pay this Debt I owe Thee  Without the borrow'd Sufferings of Another  No THEALD urge this Argument no more  I love not Life to that Degree to purchase  By the sure Death of some brave guiltless Friend  A few uncertain Days that often rise  Like This serene and gay when with swift Wing  A Moment wraps them in disastrous Fate  GLOSTER  Did we consult to save your single Life  Was that the present Question thy Refusal  Were just were generous But my Lord this Person  Who stands for you devoted should in That  Be deem'd devoted for the Christian Cause  The common Cause of  Europe  and thy Country  For That this Martyr dies dies for thy Children  Dies for the brave Companions of thy Fortune  Who weeping now around thy Tent conjure Thee  To live for them and  England  's promis'd Glory  O I must give it way My Heart is full  Of Thee my Country and my aged Veins  At Thought of Thee resume the Fire of Youth  If Honour Glory can exalt the Mind  Above the common Passions that involve  The groveling Race of Men if the first Beauty  If Virtue drest in her divinest Charms  All Nature's mingled Tenderness the Parent  The Brother Lover Friend can touch the Heart  O save our Country EDWARD save a Nation  The chosen Land the last Retreat of Freedom  Amidst a broken WorldCast back thy View  And trace from farthest Times her old Renown  Think of the Blood that to maintain her Rights  And nurse her sheltering Laws has flow'd in Battle  Or on the Patriot's Scaffo'd Think what Cares  What Vigilance what Toils what bright Contention  In Councils Camps and welldisputed Senates  It cost our generous Ancestors to raise  A matchless Plan of Freedom whence we shine  Even in the jealous Eye of hostile Nations  The happiest of MankindThen see all This  This Virtue Wisdom Toil and Blood of Ages  Behold it ready to be lost for ever  Behold us almost broken to the Yoke  Robb'd of our antient Spirit sunk in Baseness  At home corrupted and despis'd abroad  Behold our Wealth consum'd those Treasures squander'd  That might protect and nourish wholesom Peace  Or urge a glorious War on Wretches squander'd  A venal Crew that plunder and disgrace us  In this important this decisive Hour  On Thee and Thee alone our weeping Country  Turns her distressful Eye to Thee she calls  And with a helpless Parent's piercing Voice  Wilt thou not live for Her for Her subdue  A graceful Pride I own but still a Pride  That more becomes thy Courage and thy Youth  Than Birth and publick Station Nay for Her  Say wouldst thou not resign the dearest Passions  EDWARD  O there is nothing which for Thee my Country  I in my proper Person could not suffer  But thus to sculk behind another's Life  'Tis what I scarce have Courage to support  It makes a kind of Coward of me GLOSTER  And yet the Reasons urg'd I must acknowledge  Demand a deep RegardWellbe it so  Ere to this Instance of amazing Friendship  I can submit let me behold the Friend  Perhaps my Bounty may requite his Love  To those he holds much dearer than himself  Conduct him hither THEALD  SCENE III  EDWARD    GLOSTER    EDWARD  Ah my GLOSTER  You have not touch'd on something that here pleads  For longer Life beyond the Force of Reason  Perhaps too powerful pleadsmy ELEONORA  To Thee my Friend I will not be asham'd  Even to avow my Love in all its Fondness  For Oh there shines in this my dearer Self  This Partner of my Soul such a mild Light  Of careless Charms of unaffected Beauty  Such more than Beauty such endearing Goodness  That when I meet her Eye where cordial Faith  And every gentle Virtue mix their Lustre  I feel a Transport that partakes of Anguish  How shall I then behold her on the Point  To leave her GLOSTER in a distant Land  For ever in a stormy World to leave Her  There is no Misery to be fear'd like That  Which from our greatest Happiness proceeds  SCENE IV  EDWARD    GLOSTER    THEALD  presenting the Princess  ELEONORA  as the Person he went to bring  DARAXA

rise my ELEONORA  ELEONORA  Let me fulfil my Vow  EDWARD  O barbarous Vow  ELEONORA  Let me preserve a Life in which is wrapt  The Life of Thousands dearer than my own  Live thou and let me die for Thee my EDWARD  EDWARD  For methy Words are Daggers to my Soul  And wouldst thou have me then thus meanly save  A despicable Life a Life expos'd  To that worst Torment to my own Contempt  A Life still haunted by the cruel Image  Of thy last Pangs thy agonizing Throws  The dire Convulsions of these tender Limbs  And all for oneO Infamyfor one  By Love by Duty bound each manly Tie  Even by a Peasant's Honour to protect Thee  ELEONORA  This ne'er can blemish Thee I know full well  There is no Danger Pain no Form of Death  Thou wouldst not meet with Transport to protect me  But I alas an unimportant Woman  Whose only Boast and Merit is to love Thee  Ah what am I with nameless Numbers weigh'd  With Myriads yet unborn All Ranks all Ages  All Arts all Virtues all a State comprizes  These have a higher Claim to thy Protection  Live then for themO make a great Effort  What none but Heroes can bid the soft Passions  The Private stoop to Those that grasp a Public  Live to possess the Pleasure of a God  To bless a People trusted to thy Care  Live to fulfil thy long Career of Glory  But just begun To die for Thee be mine  I ne'er can find a brighter gentler Fate  And Fate will come at last inglorious Fate  O grudge me not a Portion of thy Fame  As mix'd in Love O raise me to thy Glory  EDWARD  In vain is all thy Eloquence The more  Thou wouldst perswade I with encreasing Horror  Fly from thy Purpose  ELEONORA  Dost thou love me EDWARD  EDWARD  OhIf I love TheeWitness Heaven and Earth  Angels of Death that hover round me witness  Witness these blinded Eyes these trembling Arms  This Heart that beats unutterable Fondness  To what delightful Agony I love thee  ELEONORA  Then wilt thou save me sure from greater Pain  EDWARD  O that I could from all engross thy Sufferings  Pain felt for Thee were Pleasure  ELEONORA  Hear me EDWARD  I speak the strictest Truth no Flight of Passion  I speak my naked HeartTo die I own  Is a dread Passage terrible to Nature  Chiefly to those who have like me been happy  But to survive TheeO 'tis greatly worse  'Tis a continual Death I cannot bear  The very ThoughtO leave me not behind thee  EDWARD  Since nought can alter my determin'd Breast  Why dost thou pierce me with this killing Image  ELEONORA  Ah selfish that thou art with thee the Toil  The tedious Toil of Life will soon be o'er  Thou soon wilt hide thee in the quiet Grave  While I a lonely Widow with her Orphans  Am left defenceless to a troubled World  A false ungrateful and injurious World  Oh if thou lov'st me EDWARD I conjure thee  By that celestial Flame which blends our Souls  By all a Father all a Mother feels  By every holy Tenderness I charge thee  Live to protect the Pledges of our Love  Our Children  EDWARD  Oh  ELEONORA  Our young our helpless  EDWARD  Oh  DistractionLet me go  ELEONORA  Nay drag me with thee  To the kind TombThou canst not leave our Children  Expos'd by being thine beyond the lowest  Surrounded with the Perils of a Throne  EDWARD  Cruel no more embitter thus our last  Our parting Moments Set no more the Terrors  Of these best Passions in Array against me  For by that POWER I swear Father of Life  Whose universal Love embraces all  That breathes this ample Air whose perfect Wisdom  Brings Light from Darkness and from Evil Good  To whom I recommend thee and my Children  By him I swear I never will submit  To what thy horrid Tenderness proposes  GLOSTER  My Lord  EDWARD  Ohthese Emotions are too much  I feel a heavy Languor steal upon me  Death or his Image Sleep weighs down my Soul  Conduct me to my CouchAh ELEONORA  If

Who make the Dwellings of Mankind delightful  What is vain Life an idle Flight of Days  A stilldelusive Round of sickly Joys  A Scene of little Cares and trifling Passions  If not enobled by such Deeds of Virtue  And yet this matchless Virtue what avails it  Th' afflicting Angel has forsook the Prince  And now pours out his Terrors on the Princess  Forsook him said INo he must awake  To keener

 Father of Health be prais'd  EDWARD  The Moment that I sunk upon my Couch  A sick and troubled Slumber fell upon me  Chaos of gloomy unconnected Thought  That in black Eddy whirl'd made Sleep more

DARAXA  Oh 'tis too much  I can no more support it  GLOSTER  Generous Mourner  How is it with the Princess ELEONORA  DARAXA  Struck by the Poison on her Couch she lies  A Rose softdrooping in  Sabean  Vales  Beneath the fiery Dogstar's noxious Rage  O Christian Chief I never shall forget  The Scene these melting Eyes have just beheld  With mingled Tears of Tenderness and Wonder  GLOSTER  How was it Madam  DARAXA  When this Pride of Woman  This best of Wives which in his radiant Course  The Sun beholds when first she sickening felt  Th' imperious Summons of approaching Fate  All rob'd in spotless White she sought her Altars  And prostrate there for her departing Soul  The Prince her Husband and her OrphanChildren  Implor'd th' ETERNAL MINDAs yet she held  Her swelling Tears and in her Bosom kept  Her Sighs repress'd nor did the near Approach  Of the pale King of Terrors dim her Beauty  No rather adding to her Charms it breath'd  A certain mournful Sweetness thro' her Features  But as th' increasing Bane more desperate grew  Wild to her Bed she rush'd and then indeed  The lovely Fountains of her Eyes were open'd  Then flow'd her Tears"Connubial Bed she cry'd  " Chaste Witness of my Tenderness for him  " To save whose Life I unrepining die  " In Bloom of Youth farewelThou shalt perhaps  " Receive a fairer a more happy Bride  " But never a more faithful never one  " Who loves her Husband with a fonder Passion  Here flow'd her Tears afresh with burning Lip  She press'd the humid Couch and wept again  At last while weary Sorrow paus'd she rose  And fearing lest immediate Death might seize Her  Demanded to be led to see the Prince  But Fear of chasing from his Eyes too soon  The salutary Sleep that heal'd his Pangs  Restrain'd her trembling Footsteps On her Couch  Abandon'd to Despair she sunk anew  And for her Children call'd Her Children came  A while supported on her Arm she ey'd them  With Tears pursuing Tears adown her Cheek  With all the speechless Misery of Woe  I

Mother's last Embrace  When strait reflecting that the piercing Poison  Might taint their tender Years she sudden shrunk  With Horror back"O wretched ELEONORA  " She weeping cry'd and must I then not taste  " The poor remaining Comfort of the Dying  " To see a Husband clasp my dearest Children  " And mix my parting Soul with theirs I love"  Her sad Attendants that till then had mourn'd  In silent Sorrow all at This gave way  To loud LamentsShe rais'd her languid Eye  And casting on them round a gracious Smile  To each by Name she call'd even to the lowest  To each extended mild her friendly

him  To treat of Peace And as I read his Letters  The Villain stabs meThis if This wants Light  There is no Certainty in human Reason  If This not shines with allconvincing Truth  Yon Sun is darkAnd yet these Cowards come  With lying Shifts and low elusive Arts  O it inflames my Anger into Madness  This added Insult on our Understanding  This treacherous Attempt to steal away  The only Joy and Treasure of my Life  Sweet sacred Vengeance for my murder'd Princess  SELIM  The cursed Wretch who did assail thy Life  O King of  England  was indeed an Envoy  Sent by the Prince of  Jaffa  This we own  But then he was an execrable Bigot  Who for such horrid Purposes had crept  Into the cheated Sultan's Court and Service  As by the Traltor's Papers we have learn'd  For know there lives upon the craggy Cliffs  Of wild  Phenician  Mountains a dire Race  A Nation of Assassins Dreadful Zeal  Fierce and intollerant of all Religion  That differs from their own is the black Soul  Of that infernal State Soon as their Chief  The Old Man so they stile him of the Mountains  Gives out his baleful Will however fell  However wicked and abhorr'd it be  Tho' cloth'd in Danger the most cruel Death  They swift and silent glide thro' every Land  As fly the gloomy Ministers of Vengeance  Famine and Plague they ly for Years conceal'd  Make light of Oaths nay sometimes change Religion  And never fail to execute his Orders  Of these the Villain was these ruffian Saints  The Curse of Earth the Terror of Mankind  And the Engagement Prince in this Crusado  That was the Reason whence they sought thy Life  EDWARD  False false as Hell the Lye of guilty Fear  You all are Bigots Robbers Ruffians all  It is the very Genius of your Nation  Vindictive Rage the Thirst of Blood consumes you  You live by Rapine thence your Empire rose  And your Religion is a meer Pretence  To rob and murder in the Name of Heaven  SELIM  Be patient Prince be more humane and just  You have your Virtues have your Vices too  And we have ours The liberal Hand of Nature  Has not created us nor any Nation  Beneath the blessed Canopy of Heaven  Of such malignant Clay but each may boast  Their native Virtues and their Maker's Bounty  You call us BigotsOh canst thou with that  Reproach us Christian Prince What brought thee hither  What else but Bigotry What dost thou here  What else but persecuteThe Truth is great  Greater than thee and I will give it Way  Even thou thyself in all thy Rage wilt hear it  From their remotest Source these holy Wars  What have they breath'd but Bigotry and Rapine  Did not the first  Crusaders  when their Zeal  Should have shone out the purest did they not  Led by the frantic Hermit who began  The murderous Trade thro' their own Countries spread  The Woes their Vice could not reserve for ours  Tho' this exceeds the Purport of my Message  Yet must I thus insulted in my Country  Insulted in Religion bid thee think  O King of  England  on the different Conduct  Of  Saracens  and  Christians  when beneath  Your pious GODFREY in the first Crusado  Jerusalem  was sack'd and when beneath  Our generous SALADIN it was retaken  O hideous Scene my Soul within me shrinks  Abhorrent from the ViewTwelve thousand Wretches  Receiv'd to Mercy void of all Defence  Trusting to plighted Faith to purchas'd Safety  Behold these naked Wretches in cold Blood  Men Women Children murder'd basely murder'd  The holy Temple which you came to rescue  Regorges with the barbarous Profanation  The Streets run dismal Torrents Drown'd in Blood  The very Soldier sickens at his Carnage  Couldst thou O Sun behold the bla  ing Sight  And lift again thy sacred Eye on Mortals  A ruthless Race Who can do This can do it  To please the general Father of Mankind  While nobler SALADIN  EDWARD  Away be gone  With thee vile Dervise what have I to do  I lose my Hour of Vengeance I debase me  To hold this Talk with Thee  SELIM  While Truth and Reason  Speak from my Tongue vile Dervise as I am  Yet am I greater than the highest Monarch  Who from blind Fury grows the Slave of Passion  Besides I come to justify a Prince  Howe'er in other Qualities below thee  In Love of Goodness Truth Humanity  And Honour Sir thy EqualYes thy Equal  EDWARD  What How compare me with a damn'd Assassin  A matchless VillainHa presumptuous Dervise  Thou gnawst thy quivering LipA smother'd Passion  Shakes thro' thy FrameWhat Villainy is That  Thou dar'st not utterWert thou not a Wretch  Protected by thy Habit this right Hand  Should crush thee into AtomsHence away  Go tell thy Master that I hold him base  Beyond the Power of Words to speak his Baseness  A Coward an Assassinating Coward  And when I once have dragg'd him from his City  Which I will straitway doI then will make him  In all the Gall and Bitterness of Guilt  Grinding the vengeful Steel betwixt his Teeth  Will make the Traitor own it    SELIM  discovering himself  Never  EDWARD  Ha  SELIM  Thou canst not haughty MonarchI am He  I am this SELIM this insulted SELIM  Yet clear as Day and will confound thy Passion  EDWARD  Thou SELIM  SELIM  I  EDWARD  Was ever Guilt so bold  SELIM  Did ever Innocence descend to fear  EDWARD  This bears some Shew of Honour Wilt thou then  Decide it by the Sword  SELIM  I will do more  EDWARD  How more  SELIM  Decide it by superior Reason  EDWARD  No weak Evasions  SELIM  If I not convince thee  If by thy self I am not of this Crime  Acquitted then I grant thee thy Demand  Nay more yon yielded City shall be thine  For know hot Prince I should disdain a Throne  I could not fill with Honour Were I guilty  I would not tremble at thy threatning Voice  No 'tis my self I fear  EDWARD  What shall I think  SELIM  Hear but one Witness and I ask no more  To clear my Name The Witness is a Woman  Her Looks are Truth fair uncorrupted Faith  Beams from her Eyes Thou ne'er canst doubt such Beauty  For 'tis th' Expression of a spotless Soul  EDWARD  Curse on thy mean luxurious Eastern Arts  Of Cowardice Thou wouldst seduce my Vengeance  But I detest all BeautyBarbarous Sultan  Ah thou hast murder'd Beauty thy fell Crime  Haste GLOSTER hasteIn sight of Camp and City  Prepare the ListsNow show thy self a Prince  Or dy in shameful Tortures like a Slave  SELIM  I came not hither or to dread thy Wrath  Or court thy Mercy  GLOSTER  Sir you cannot justly  Refuse him his Demand The servent Soul  Of undissembled Innocence methinks  Is felt in what he says First hear this Person  And if she gives not full Conviction then  Have then Recourse to what should always be  The last Appeal of reasonable Beings  Brute Force  EDWARD  Well then conduct Her hither Sultan    SELIM  goes out  Ah my disorder'd Mind from Thought to Thought  Uncertain toss'd the Wreck of stormy Passion  This Rage awhile supports me but I feel  It will desert me soon and I again  Shall soon relapse to Misery and Weakness  O ELEONORA little didst thou think  How deeply wretched thy dire Gift of Life  Would make me  SCENE IV  EDWARD    GLOSTER    THEALD    To them  SELIM  conducting  ELEONORA    DARAXA    SELIM  Raise thy Eyes O King of  England    To the bright Witness of my blameless Honour  EDWARD  No Beauty shall no more engage my Eyes  It shall no more profane the Shrine devoted  To the sweet Image of my ELEONORA  Let her declare her Knowledge in this Matter  ELEONORA  Will not my EDWARD bless me with a Look  EDWARD  What Angel borrows ELEONORA'S Voice  O thou pale Shade of Her I weep for ever  Permit me thus to worship theeThou art  Amazing HeavenThou art my ELEONORA  My ELEONORA'S Self my dear my felt  My living ELEONORAWhatto whom  Owe I this Miracle this better Life  Oppressive Joyowe I my ELEONORA  ELEONORA  To him that generous Prince who put his Life  His Honour on the desperate Risque to save me  When number'd with the Dead who brought himself  A swift and powerful Remedy by which  I am to Light restor'dto thee my EDWARD  EDWARD  To him to himO monstrouswhom I thus  Have with such Inhumanity insulted  O blind O brutish O injurious Rage  They they are wise who when they feel thy Madness  Seal up their Lips And canst thou then forgive me  Thou who hast o'er me gain'd that noblest Triumph  The Triumph of HumanityThou canst  'Tis easier for the Generous to forgive  Than for Offence to ask it  SELIM  Use not Prince  So harsh a Word More than forgive I love  Thy noble Heat thy beautiful Disorder  O I am too much Man I feel myself  Too much the charming Force of human Passions  E'er to pretend with supercilious Brow  With proud affected Virtue to disdain them  EDWARD  How generous Sultan how shall I requite Thee  HereTake thy lov'd DARAXA whom I meant  To have restor'd when this Misfortune happen'd  But secretworking HEAVEN ordain'd her Stay  To save us all  SELIM  Wert thou the Lord of Earth  Thou could'st not give me moremy dear DARAXA  EDWARD  Hence to the Camp my GLOSTERBid the Soldiers  Forsake the TrenchesLet unbounded Joy  Reign fearless o'er the mingled Camp and City  Go tell my faithful Soldiers that their Queen  My ELEONORA lives A Prize beyond  The Chance of War to give She lives to soften  My too imperious Temper and to make them  To make my People happyO my Soul  What Love e'er equall'd thine O dearest best  Pride of thy Sex inimitable Goodness  Whenever Woman henceforth shall be prais'd  For conjugal Affection Men will say  There shine the Virtues of an ELEONORA  Transporting BlissHow bountiful is Heaven  Depressing often but to raise us more  Let never those despair who follow Virtue  LoveGratitudedivide meOnce more Sultan  Forgive me pardon my mistaken Zeal  That left my Country cross'd the stormy Seas  To war with thee brave Prince to war with Honour  Now that my Passions give me leave to think  The Hand of HEAVEN appears in what I suffer'd  My erring Zeal has suffer'd by a Bigot  SELIM  It does O King And venerable Christian  I know thy Moderation will excuse me  But since by ruling WISDOM who unweigh'd  Unmeant does Nought Men are so various made  So various turn'd that in Opinions they  Must blindly think or take a different Way  In spite of Force since Judgment will be free  Then let us in this righteous Mean agree  Let holy Rage let Persecution cease  Let the Head argue but the Heart be Peace  Let all Mankind in Love of what is right  In Virtue and Humanity unite  The END
