herself depart  Can she forget the darling of her heart  The little darling whom she bore and bred  Nurs'd on her knees and at her bosom fed  To whom she seem'd her ev'ry thought to give  And in whose life alone she seem'd to live  Yes from herself the mother may depart  She may forget the darling of her heart  The little darling whom she bore and bred  Nurs'd on her knees and at her bosom fed  To whom she seem'd her ev'ry thought to give  And in whose life alone she seem'd to live  But I cannot forget whilst life remains  And pours her current thro' these swelling veins  Whilst Mem'ry offers up at Reason's shrine  But I cannot forget that GOTHAM's mine  Can the stern Mother than the brutes more wild  From her disnatur'd breast tear her young child  Flesh of her flesh and of her bone the bone  And dash the smiling babe against a stone  Yes the stern Mother than the brutes more wild  From her disnatur'd breast may tear her child  Flesh of her flesh and of her bone the bone  And dash the smiling babe against a stone  But I forbid it Heav'n but I can ne'er  The love of GOTHAM from this bosom tear  Can ne'er so far true Royalty pervert  From its fair course to do my people hurt  With how much ease with how much confidence  As if superior to each grosser sense  Reason had only in full pow'r array'd  To manifest her Will and be obey'd  Men make resolves and pass into decrees  The motions of the Mind with how much ease  In such resolves doth passion make a flaw  And bring to nothing what was rais'd to law  In empire young scarce warm on GOTHAM'S throne  The dangers and the sweets of pow'r unknown  Pleas'd tho' I scarce know why like some young child  Whose little senses each new toy turns wild  How do I hold sweet dalliance with my crown  And wanton with dominion how lay down  Without the sanction of a precedent  Rules of most large and absolute extent  Rules which from sense of public virtue spring  And all at once commence a PATRIOT KING  But for the day of tryal is at hand  And the whole fortunes of a mighty land  Are stak'd on me and all their Weal or Woe  Must from my Good or Evil Conduct flow  Will I or can I on a fair review  As I assume that name deserve it too  Have I well weigh'd the great the noble part  I'm now to play Have I explor'd my Heart  That labyrinth of fraud that deep dark cell  Where unsuspected e'en by me may dwell  Ten thousand follies Have I found out there  What I am fit to do and what to bear  Have I trac'd ev'ry passion to its rise  Nor spar'd one lurking seed of treach'rous vice  Have I familiar with my nature grown  And am I fairly to myself made known  A PATRIOT KINGWhy 'tis a name which bears  The more immediate stamp of Heav'n which wears  The nearest best resemblance we can shew  Of God above thro' all his works below  To still the voice of discord in the land  To make weak faction's discontented band  Detected weak and crumbling to decay  With hunger pinch'd on their own vitals prey  Like brethren in the selfsame int'rests warm'd  Like diff'rent bodies with one soul imform'd  To make a nation nobly rais'd above  All meaner thoughts grow up in common love  To give the laws due vigour and to hold  That sacred ballance temperate yet bold  With such an equal hand that those who fear  May yet approve and own my justice clear  To be a Common Father to secure  The weak from violence from pride the poor  Vice and her sons to banish in disgrace  To make Corruption dread to shew her face  To bid afflicted Virtue take new state  And be at last acquainted with the great  Of all Religions to elect the best  Nor let her priests be made a standing jest  Rewards for Worth with lib'ral hand to carve  To love the Arts nor let the Artists starve  To make fair Plenty through the realm increase  Give Fame in War and happiness in Peace  To see my people virtuous great and free  And know that all those blessings flow from me  O 'tis a joy too exquisite a thought  Which flatters Nature more than flatt'ry ought  'Tis a great glorious task for Man too hard  But not less great less glorious the reward  The best reward which here to Man is giv'n  'Tis more than Earth and little short of Heav'n  A task if such comparison may be  The same in nature diff'ring in degree  Like that which God on whom for aid I call  Performs with ease and yet performs to all  How much do they mistake how little know  Of kings of kingdoms and the pains which flow  From royalty who fancy that a crown  Because it glistens must be lin'd with down  With outside show and vain appearance caught  They look no farther and by Folly taught  Prize high the toys of thrones but never find  One of the many cares which lurk behind  The gem they worship which a crown adorns  Nor once suspect that crown is lin'd with thorns  O might Reflection Folly's place supply  Would we one moment use her piercing eye  Then should we learn what woe from grandeur springs  And learn to pity not to envy kings  The villager born humbly and bred hard  Content his wealth and Poverty his guard  In action simply just in conscience clear  By guilt untainted undisturb'd by fear  His means but scanty and his wants but few  Labour his business and his pleasure too  Enjoys more comforts in a single hour  Than ages give the Wretch condemn'd to Pow'r  Call'd up by health he rises with the day  And goes to work as if he went to play  Whistling off toils one half of which might make  The stoutest ATLAS of a palace quake  'Gainst heat and cold which make us cowards faint  Harden'd by constant use without complaint  He bears what we should think it death to bear  Short are his meals and homely is his fare  His thirst he slakes at some pure neighb'ring brook  Nor asks for sauce where appetite stands cook  When the dews fall and when the Sun retires  Behind the Mountains when the village fires  Which waken'd all at once speak supper nigh  At distance catch and fix his longing eye  Homeward he hies and with his manly brood  Of rawbon'd cubs enjoys that clean coarse food  Which season'd with Good Humour his fond Bride  'Gainst his return is happy to provide  Then free from care and free from thought he creeps  Into his straw and till the morning sleeps  Not so the Kingwith anxious cares oppress'd  His bosom labours and admits not rest  A glorious Wretch he sweats beneath the Weight  Of Majesty and gives up ease for state  E'en when his smiles which by the fools of pride  Are treasur'd and preserv'd from side to side  Fly round the court e'en when compell'd by form  He seems most calm his soul is in a storm  CARE like a spectre seen by him alone  With all her nest of vipers round his throne  By day crawls full in view when Night bids sleep  Sweet nurse of Nature o'er the senses creep  When Misery herself no more complains  And slaves if possible forget their chains  Tho' his sense weakens tho' his eye grows dim  That rest which comes to all comes not to him  E'en at that hour CARE tyrant CARE forbids  The dew of sleep to fall upon his lids  From night to night she watches at his bed  Now as one mop'd sits brooding o'er his head  Anon she starts and borne on raven's wings  Croaks forth aloudSleep was not made for kings  Thrice hath the Moon who governs this vast ball  Who rules most absolute o'er me and all  To whom by full conviction taught to bow  At new at full I pay the duteous vow  Thrice hath the Moon her wonted course pursu'd  Thrice hath she lost her form and thrice renew'd  Since blessed be that season for before  I was a mere mere mortal and no more  One of the herd a lump of common clay  Inform'd with life to die and pass away  Since I became a king and GOTHAM'S throne  With full and ample pow'r became my own  Thrice hath the Moon her wonted course pursu'd  Thrice hath she lost her form and thrice renew'd  Since Sleep kind Sleep who like a friend supplies  New vigour for new toil hath clos'd these eyes  Nor if my toils are answer'd with success  And I am made an instrument to bless  The people whom I love shall I repine  Theirs be the benefit the labour mine  Mindful of that high rank in which I stand  Of millions Lord sole ruler in the land  Let me and Reason shall her aid afford  Rule my own spirit of myself be lord  With an ill grace that monarch wears his crown  Who stern and hard of nature wears a frown  'Gainst faults in other men yet all the while  Meets his own vices with a partial smile  How can a king yet on record we find  Such kings have been such curses of mankind  Enforce that law 'gainst some poor subject elf  Which Conscience tells him he hath broke himself  Can he some petty rogue to Justice call  For robbing one when he himself robs all  Must not unless extinguish'd Conscience fly  Into his cheek and blast his fading eye  To scourge th' oppressor when the State distress'd  And sunk to ruin is by him oppress'd  Against himself doth he not sentence give  If one must die t'other's not fit to live  Weak is that throne and in itself unsound  Which takes not solid virtue for its ground  All envy pow'r in others and complain  Of that which they would perish to obtain  Nor can those spirits turbulent and bold  Not to be aw'd by threats nor bought with gold  Be hush'd to peace but when fair legal sway  Makes it their real int'rest to obey  When kings and none but fools can then rebel  Not less in Virtue than in Pow'r excell  Be that my object that my constant care  And may my Soul's best Wishes centre there  Be it my task to seek nor seek in vain  Not only how to live but how to reign  And to those Virtues which from Reason spring  And grace the Man join those which grace the King  First  for strict duty bids my care extend  And reach to all who on that care depend  Bids me with servants keep a steady hand  And watch o'er all my proxies in the land  First  and that method Reason shall support  Before I look into and purge my Court  Before I cleanse the stable of the state  Let me fix things which to myself relate  That done and all accounts well settled here  In Resolution firm in Honour clear  Tremble ye Slaves who dare abuse your trust  Who dare be Villains when your King is Just  Are there amongst those officers of State  To whom our sacred pow'r we delegate  Who hold our Place and Office in the Realm  Who in our name commission'd guide the Helm  Are there who trusting to our love of ease  Oppress our subjects wrest out just decrees  And make the laws warp'd from their fair intent  To speak a language which they never meant  Are there such Men and can the fools depend  On holding out in safety to their end  Can they so much from thoughts of danger free  Deceive themselves so much misdeem of me  To think that I will prove a Statesman's tool  And live a stranger where I ought to rule  What to myself and to my State unjust  Shall I from ministers take things on trust  And sinking low the credit of my throne  Depend upon dependants of my own  Shall I most certain source of future cares  Not use my Judgment but depend on their's  Shall I true puppetlike be mock'd with State  Have nothing but the Name of being great  Attend at councils which I must not weigh  Do what they bid and what they dictate say  Enrob'd and hoisted up into my chair  Only to be a royal Cypher there  Perish the thought'tis Treason to my throne  And who but thinks it could his thoughts be known  Insults me more than He who leagu'd with hell  Shall rise in arms and 'gainst my crown rebell  The wicked Statesman whose false heart pursues  A train of Guilt who acts with double views  And wears a double face whose base designs  Strike at his Monarch's throne who undermines  E'en whilst he seems his wishes to support  Who seizes all departments packs a court  Maintains an agent on the Judgement Seat  To screen his crimes and make his frauds complete  New models armies and around the throne  Will suffer none but creatures of his own  Conscious of such his baseness well may try  Against the light to shut his master's eye  To keep him coop'd and far remov'd from those  Who brave and honest dare his crimes disclose  Nor ever let him in one place appear  Where Truth unwelcome Truth may wound his Ear  Attempts like these well weigh'd themselves proclaim  And whilst they publish baulk their Author's aim  Kings must be blind into such snares to run  Or worse with open eyes must be undone  The minister of Honesty and Worth  Demands the Day to bring his actions forth  Calls on the Sun to shine with fiercer rays  And braves that trial which must end in praise  None fly the Day and seek the shades of Night  But those whose actions cannot bear the Light  None wish their King in Ignorance to hold  But those who feel that knowledge must unfold  Their hidden Guilt and that dark mist dispell'd  By which their places and their lives are held  Confusion wait them and by Justice led  In vengeance fall on ev'ry traitor's head  Aware of this and caution'd 'gainst the pit  Where Kings have oft been lost shall I submit  And rust in chains like these Shall I give way  And whilst my helpless subjects fall a prey  To pow'r abus'd in Ignorance sit down  Nor dare assert the honour of my crown  When stern REBELLION if that odious name  Justly belongs to those whose only aim  Is to preserve their Country who oppose  In honour leagu'd none but their Country's foes  Who only seek their own and found their Cause  In due regard for violated laws  When stern REBELLION who no longer feels  Nor fears Rebuke a nation at her heels  A nation up in arms tho' strong not proud  Knocks at the Palace gate and calling loud  For due redress presents from Truth's fair pen  A list of wrongs not to be borne by men  How must that King be humbled how disgrace  All that is royal in his name and place  Who thus call'd forth to answer can advance  No other plea but that of IGNORANCE  A vile defence which was his All at stake  The meanest subject well might blush to make  A filthy source from whence Shame ever springs  A Stain to all but most a Stain to Kings  The Soul with great and manly feelings warm'd  Panting for Knowledge rests not till inform'd  And shall not I fir'd with the glorious zeal  Feel those brave passions which my subjects feel  Or can a just excuse from Ign'rance flow  To Me whose first great duty isTo KNOW  Hence IGNORANCEthy settled dull blank eye  Wou'd hurt me tho' I knew no reason why  Hence IGNORANCEthy slavish shackles bind  The freeborn Soul and lethargy the mind  Of thee begot by PRIDE who look'd with scorn  On ev'ry meaner match of thee was born  That grave Inflexibility of Soul  Which Reason can't convince nor Fear controul  Which neither arguments nor pray'rs can reach  And nothing less than utter Ruin teach  Hence IGNORANCEhence to that depth of Night  Where thou wast born where not one gleam of light  May wound thine eyehence to some dreary cell  Where Monks with Superstition love to dwell  Or in some college soothe thy lazy pride  And with the Heads of colleges reside  Fit mate for Royalty thou can'st not be  And if no mate for kings no mate for me  Come STUDY like a torrent swell'd with rains  Which rushing down the mountains o'er the plains  Spreads horror wide and yet in horror kind  Leaves feeds of future fruitfulness behind  Come STUDYpainful tho' thy course and slow  Thy real worth by thy effects we know  Parent of Knowledge comenot Thee I call  Who grave and dull in college or in hall  Dost fit all solemn sad and moping weigh  Things which when found thy labours can't repay  Nor in one hand fit emblem of thy trade  A  Rod  in t'other gaudily array'd  A  Hornbook  gilt and letter'd call I Thee  Who dost in form preside o'er A B C  Nor Siren tho' thou art and thy strange charms  As 'twere by magic lure men to thy arms  Do I call Thee who thro' a winding maze  A labyrinth of puzzling pleasing ways  Dost lead us at the last to those rich plains  Where in full glory real SCIENCE reigns  Fair tho' thou art and lovely to mine eye  Tho' full rewards in thy possession lie  To crown Man's wish and do thy fav'rites grace  Tho' was I station'd in an humbler place  I could be ever happy in thy sight  Toil with thee all the day and thro' the night  Toil on from watch to watch bidding my eye  Fast rivetted on SCIENCE sleep defy  Yet such the hardships which from empire flow  Must I thy sweet society forego  And to some happy rival's arms resign  Those charms which can alas no more be mine  No more from hour to hour from day to day  Shall I pursue thy steps and urge my way  Where eager love of SCIENCE calls no more  Attempt those paths which Man ne'er trod before  No more the mountain scal'd the desart crost  Losing myself nor knowing I was lost  Travel thro' woods thro' wilds from Morn to Night  From Night to Morn yet travel with delight  And having found thee lay me down content  Own all my toil well paid my time well spent  Farewell ye MUSES toofor such mean things  Must not presume to dwell with mighty Kings  Farewell ye MUSEStho' it cuts my heart  E'en to the quick we must for ever part  When the fresh Morn bade lusty Nature wake  When the Birds sweetly twitt'ring thro' the brake  Tun'd their soft pipes when from the neighb'ring bloom  Sipping the dew each Zephyr stole persume  When all things with new vigour were inspir'd  And seem'd to say they never could be tir'd  How often have we stray'd whilst sportive Rhime  Deceiv'd the way and clipp'd the wings of Time  O'er hill o'er dale how often laugh'd to see  Yourselves made visible to none but me  The clown his Work suspended gape and stare  And seem to think that I convers'd with Air  When the Sun beating on the parched soil  Seem'd to proclaim an interval of toil  When a faint languor crept thro' ev'ry breast  And things most us'd to labour wish'd for rest  How often underneath a rev'rend oak  Where safe and fearless of the impious stroke  Some sacred DRYAD liv'd or in some grove  Where with capricious fingers FANCY wove  Her fairy bow'r whilst NATURE all the while  Look'd on and view'd her mock'ries with a smile  How we held converse sweet how often laid  Fast by the Thames in HAM'S inspiring shade  Amongst those Poets which make up your train  And after death pour forth the sacred Strain  Have I at your command in verse grown grey  Put not impaired heard DRYDEN tune that lay  Which might have drawn an Angel from his sphere  And kept him from his office list'ning here  When dreary NIGHT with MORPHEUS in her train  Led on by SILENCE to resume her reign  With Darkness covering as with a robe  This scene of Levity blank'd half the globe  How oft' enchanted with your heav'nly strains  Which stole me from myself which in soft chains  Of Musick bound my soul how oft' have I  Sounds more than human floating thro' the Sky  Attentive sat whilst NIGHT against her Will  Transported with the harmony stood still  How oft' in raptures which Man scarce could bear  Have I when gone still thought the Muses there  Still heard their Music and as mute as death  Sat all attention drew in ev'ry Breath  Lest breathing all too rudely I should wound  And marr that magic excellence of sound  Then Sense returning with return of Day  Have chid the Night which fled so fast away  Such my Pursuits and such my Joys of yore  Such were my Mates but now my Mates no more  Plac'd out of Envy's walk for Envy sure  Would never haunt the cottage of the Poor  Would never stoop to wound my homespun lays  With some few Friends and some small share of Praise  Beneath Oppression undisturb'd by Strife  In Peace I trod the humble vale of Life  Farewell these scenes of ease this tranquil state  Welcome the troubles which on Empire wait  Light toys from this day forth I disavow  They pleas'd me once but cannot suit me now  To common Men all common things are free  What honours them might fix disgrace on me  Call'd to a throne and o'er a mighty land  Ordain'd to rule my head my heart my hand  Are all engross'd each private view withstood  And task'd to labour for the Public Good  Be this my study to this one great end  May ev'ry thought may ev'ry action tend  Let me the page of History turn o'er  Th' instructive page and heedfully explore  What faithful pens of former times have wrote  Of former kings what they did worthy note  What worthy blame and from the sacred tomb  Where righteous Monarchs sleep where laurels bloom  Unhurt by Time let me a garland twine  Which robbing not their Fame may add to mine  Nor let me with a vain and idle eye  Glance o'er those scenes and in a hurry fly  Quick as a Post which travels day and night  Nor let me dwell there lur'd by false delight  And into barren theory betray'd  Forget that Monarchs are for action made  When am'rous SPRING repairing all his charms  Calls Nature forth from hoary Winter's arms  Where like a Virgin to some letcher sold  Three wretched months she lay benumb'd and cold  When the weak Flow'r which shrinking from the breath  Of the rude North and timorous of Death  To its kind Mother Earth for shelter fled  And on her bosom hid its tender head  Peeps forth afresh and chear'd by milder skies  Bids in full splendour all her beauties rise  The Hive is up in armsexpert to teach  Nor proudly to be taught unwilling each  Seems from her fellow a new zeal to catch  Strength in her limbs and on her wings dispatch  The BEE goes forth from herb to herb she flies  From Flow'r to Flow'r and loads her lab'ring thighs  With treasur'd sweets robbing those Flow'rs which left  Find not themselves made poorer by the theft  Their scents as lively and their looks as fair  As if the pillager had not been there  Ne'er doth she flit on Pleasure's silken Wing  Ne'er doth she loit'ring let the bloom of Spring  Unrifled pass and on the downy breast  Of some fair Flow'r indulge untimely rest  Ne'er doth she drinking deep of those rich dews  Which Chymist Night prepar'd that faith abuse  Due to the hive and selfish in her toils  To her own private use convert the spoils  Love of the Stock first call'd her forth to roam  And to the Stock she brings her booty Home  Be this my PatternAs becomes a King  Let me fly all abroad on Reason's wing  Let mine eye like the Light'ning thro' the Earth  Run to and fro nor let one deed of Worth  In any Place and Time nor let one Man  Whose actions may enrich Dominion's plan  Escape my Note be all from the first day  Of Nature to this hour be all my prey  From those whom Time at the desire of Fame  Hath spar'd let Virtue catch an equal flame  From those who not in mercy but in rage  Time hath repriev'd to damn from age to age  Let me take warning lesson'd to distill  And imitating Heav'n draw Good from Ill  Nor let these great researches in my breast  A monument of useless labour rest  Nolet them spreadth' effects let GOTHAM share  And reap the harvest of their Monarch's care  Be other Times and other Countries known  Only to give fresh Blessings to my own  Let me and may that God to whom I fly  On whom for needful succour I rely  In this great Hour that glorious God of Truth  Thro' whom I reign in mercy to my youth  Assist my weakness and direct me right  From ev'ry speck which hangs upon the Sight  Purge my mind's eye nor let one cloud remain  To spread the shades of error o'er my Brain  Let me Impartial with unweary'd thought  Try Men and Things let me as Monarchs ought  Examine well on what my Pow'r depends  What are the gen'ral Principles and Ends  Of Government how Empire first began  And wherefore Man was rais'd to reign o'er Man  Let me consider as from one great Source  We see a thousand rivers take their course  Dispers'd and into diff'rent channels led  Yet by their Parent still supply'd and fed  That Government tho' branch'd out far and wide  In various Modes to various lands applied  Howe'er it differs in its outward frame  In the main Groundwork's ev'ry where the same  The same her view tho' different her plan  Her grand and gen'ral view the Good of Man  Let me find out by Reason's sacred beams  What System in itself most perfect seems  Most worthy Man most likely to conduce  To all the purposes of gen'ral use  Let me find too where by fair Reason try'd  It fails when to Particulars appli'd  Why in that mode all Nations do not join  And chiefly why it cannot suit with mine  Let me the gradual Rise of empires trace  'Till they seem'd founded on Perfection's base  Then for when human things have made their way  To Excellence they hasten to decay  Let me whilst Observation lends her clue  Step by Step to their quick Decline pursue  Enabled by a chain of Facts to tell  Not only how they rose but how they fell  Let me not only the distempers know  Which in all States from common causes grow  But likewise those which by the will of Fate  On each peculiar mode of Empire wait  Which in its very Constitution lurk  Too sure at last to do its destin'd work  Let me forewarn'd each Sign each System learn  That I my people's danger may discern  E'er 'tis too late wish'd Health to reassure  And if it can be found find out a cure  Let me tho' great grave Brethren of the gown  Preach all Faith up and preach all Reason down  Making those jar whom Reason meant to join  And vesting in themselves a right divine  Let me thro' Reason's glass with searching eye  Into the depth of that Religion pry  Which Law hath sanction'd let me find out there  What's Form what's Essence what like vagrant Air  We well may change and what without a crime  Cannot be chang'd to the last Hour of Time  Nor let me suffer that outrageous zeal  Which without knowledge furious Bigots feel  Fair in pretence tho' at the heart unfound  These sep'rate points at random to confound  The Times have been when priests have dar'd to tread  Proud and insulting on their Monarch's head  When whilst they made Religion a pretence  Out of the World they banish'd common sense  When some soft King too open to deceit  Easy and unsuspecting join'd the cheat  Dup'd by mock Piety and gave his name  To serve the vilest purposes of shame  Fear not my People where no cause of fear  Can justly riseYour King secures you here  Your King who scorns the haughty prelate's nod  Nor deems the voice of priests the voice of God  Let me tho' Lawyers may perhaps forbid  Their Monarch to behold what they wish hid  And for the purposes of knavish gain  Would have their trade a mystery remain  Let me disdaining all such slavish awe  Dive to the very bottom of the Law  Let me the weak dead letter left behind  Search out the Principles the Spirit find  Till from the parts made master of the whole  I see the  Constitution  's very Soul  Let me tho' Statesmen will no doubt resist  And to my eyes present a fearful lift  Of men whose wills are opposite to mine  Of men great men determin'd to resign  Let me with firmness which becomes a King  Conscious from what a source my actions spring  Determin'd not by worlds to be withstood  When my grand object is my Country's Good  Unravel all low Ministerial scenes  Destroy their jobs lay bare their ways and means  And track them step by step let me well know  How Places Pensions and Preferments go  Why Guilt's provided for when Worth is not  And why one Man of merit is forgot  Let me in Peace in War Supreme preside  And dare to know my way without a Guide  Let me tho' Dignity by nature proud  Retires from view and  swells  behind a cloud  As if the Sun shone with less pow'rful ray  Less Grace less Glory shining ev'ry day  Tho' when she comes forth into public sight  Unbending as a Ghost she stalks upright  With such an air as we have often seen  And often laugh'd at in a tragic queen  Nor at her presence tho' base Myriads crook  The supple knee vouchsafes a single look  Let me all vain parade all empty pride  All terrors of Dominion laid aside  All ornament and needless helps of art  All those big looks which speak a little Heart  Know which few Kings alas have ever known  How Affability becomes a Throne  Destroys all fear bids Love with Rev'rence live  And gives those Graces Pride can never give  Let the stern Tyrant keep a distant state  And hating all Men fear return of Hate  Conscious of Guilt retreat behind his throne  Secure from all upbraidings but his own  Let all my Subjects have access to Me  Be my ears open as my heart is free  In full fair tide let Information flow  That evil is half cur'd whose cause we know  And thou where e'er thou art thou wretched Thing  Who art afraid to look up to a King  Lay by thy fearsmake but thy grievance plain  And if I not redress thee may my Reign  Close up that very Momentto prevent  The course of JUSTICE from her fair intent  In vain my nearest dearest friend shall plead  In vain my mother kneelmy soul may bleed  But must not changeWhen JUSTICE draws the dart  Tho' it is doom'd to pierce a Fav'rite's Heart  'Tis mine to give it force to give it aim  I know it Duty and I feel it
