 AN EPITOME OF THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE INSECTS OF INDIA AND THE ISLANDS IN THE INDIAN SEAS  COMPRISING UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY  FIGURES AND DESCRIPTIONS  OF THE MOST SINGULAR AND BEAUTIFUL SPECIES SELECTED CHIEFLY FROM THOSE RECENTLY DISCOVERED AND WHICH HAVE NOT APPEARED IN THE WORKS OF ANY PRECEDING AUTHOR  THE FIGURES ARE ACCURATELY DRAWN ENGRAVED AND COLOURED FROM SPECIMENS OF THE INSECTS  THE DESCRIPTIONS ARE ARRANGED ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM OF LINNAEUS WITH REFERENCES TO THE WRITINGS OF FABRICIUS AND OTHER SYSTEMATIC AUTHORS  By E DONOVAN  AUTHOR OF THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE

PATERNOSTER ROW    ADVERTISEMENT  ABOUT four years since the Author published an Epitome of the Insects of China precisely in the same form and nearly on the same plan as those of India which are now submitted to the public Of the encouragement he experienced on that occasion it might be highly improper to speak with confidence at this moment lest the sincerity of his motives should be misconceived Whether he is entitled to expect the like degree of countenance as before must rest alone with the candid reader to decide For his own part he will be content to say that the favourable reception which the Epitome of the Insects of China met with was an irresistible inducement with the Author to undertake a similar illustration of the Insects of India and that whatever may have been ultimately his success he has not been less soli∣citous to render it in every respect as interesting and complete as the former work  Various arguments might be adduced in behalf of the present publication to one of which we cannot refrain adverting It becomes our peculiar province at this time to awaken the public curiosity to a subject of no mean importance we are about to consider with atten∣tion the entomological productions of a country for which we ought to cherish the liveliest and deepest interest as being connected intimately with the prosperity the dignity and honour of the British empirein a word of British India that invaluable portion of terri∣torial domains so long retained in our possession and finally confirmed to us by the brilliant career of glory that has so recently crowned the exertions of British valour in the eastern world Not that the Author can be disposed to attach any greater degree of consequence to the subject of Indian Entomology in particular than it may really merit from the con∣templation of events of such vast political magnitude as those alluded to he is only inclined to entertain the opinion that a work professedly treating upon the Natural History of a country in which as a nation we have such an immediate interest will not be thought des∣titute of some legitimate claim to public protection Further still he must believe that a work which from the extent of its design and style of embellishments is calculated to display the Entomology of India to advantage will not prove unacceptable and as no attempt has been hitherto made to elucidate this beautiful tribe of creatures in a similar manner that the present work may become hereafter of some utility at least to many individuals who reside in India as well as to the naturalist in this country  That the Epitome of Indian Insects is not entirely confined to those found in such parts of India as are in the British possession should be clearly stated since it embraces on the con∣trary the most choice selection possible of those which inhabit every other part of that vast continent and also the islands situated in the Indian seas The far greater number of insects included in this selection are described and figured from specimens in the cabinet of the Author that were originally collected by the late Duchess of Portland Mr Tunstal Gover∣nor Holford many years resident in India Mr Ellis Mr Keate Mr Yeats and Mr Bailey  The author has to acknowledge likewise the advantages derived occasionally from inspecting the noble collections of Mr Francillon Mr Drury and some others spoken of in the course of this work among which he ought to mention that of A M'Leay Esq especially as being one from which he has received very material assistance And lastly the Author cannot permit the opportunity to escape him which the present instance affords to repeat his thanks to that munificent patron of the sciences the Right Hon Sir J Banks Bart KB for the unreserved access to his classic cabinet and library with which he has been at all times indulged in order to complete his General Illustration of Entomology of which the Epitome of Indian Insects

seen from several parts of the East Indies  Pausus denticornis  Pausus thoracicus  Fichtelii pilicornis  PAUSUS DENTICORNIS  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae consisting of two joints the exterior one clavated and furnished with a hook or spinous process  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Brown wingcases suscous on the back with a brown posterior spot on each club of the antennae foliaceous with a single tooth  PAUSUS DENTICORNIS brunneus elytris dorso fuscis macula postice brunnea antennarum clava foliacea unidentata  The first account of the Pausus genus appears in a small tract written by Linnaeus and published at Upsal in the year under the title of  Bigas Insectorum  c This paper contains likewise a description of the Diopsis genus which together with the Pausus are unquestionably two of the most singular genera of the many tribes of insects hitherto discovered Both may possibly derive some additional celebrity also from the recollection that the dissertation in which they are inserted concluded the Entomological labours of that distinguished naturalist it was the last he ever published in the department of zoology  In the dissertation alluded to the Pausus genus is exemplified by the species  Microcephalus  Diopsis by  Ichneumonea  a plate with figures of both which drawn by J Afzelius and engraved by Berquist accom∣pany the descriptions It is to this plate and the original descriptions of Linnaeus that Fuefly is indebted solely for the account he gives of both these genera in his  Archiv der Insectengeschichte  printed at Zurich in The figures are precisely copies of those engraved by Berquist as are likewise those contained in the French translation of that work which afterwards appeared in Paris Indeed as Professor Afzelius has sug∣gested from the repeated errors that appear in those works in translating the Linnaean observations defining the character of the Pausus genus c it is very likely that neither Fuefly nor his translators Herbst Gmelin and some other writers who have treated on it ever saw an insect of the Pausus genus the same might be truly said of the Diopsis genus also  Thunberg during his travels through the country of the Hottentots in found two coleopterous insects which he conceived with much propriety ought to be referred to a new genus neither of those esta∣blished previous to his departure from Europe by Linnaeus being calculated to admit them But on his return to Sweden he found that Linnaeus in his absence had described that of Pausus or as he called it Paussus to which they might be referred An account of these was afterwards inserted in the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Stockholm for this paper is accompanied with a figure of only one of the insects mentioned  lineata  a species very aptly named from the distinct longitudinal streak on each of the wingcases and which is clearly of the same natural family as the Linnaean Pausus Microcephalus the other insect described by Thunberg he calls ruberFabricius consigns these with the Linnaean insect to his genus  Cerocoma  The latest history of the Pausus genus is from the pen of Professor Afzelius a learned copious and elabo∣rate paper inserted in the fourth volume of the Transactions of the Linnaean Society He describes Pausus Microcephalus and also another kind which he found in Africa and names Sphaeroides We may justly regret on the perusal of this excellent paper that only two species of the Pausus were known to this writer Neither of those insects are allied to the four following species which appear to be entirely undescribed For this important accession of new species to a genus heretofore so little known and in consequence so imperfectly understood we are indebted to the active and praiseworthy zeal of Mr Fichtel in compliment to whom one of them is named Fichtelii They were all found in the vicinity of Bengal  Pausus denticornis is clearly of the same natural family as the rest having the same kind of biarticulated antennae the club is even much larger in proportion than in the others and the lateral pointed process more conspicuous yet according to the character laid down by Afzelius this should not be admitted into the Pausus genus the number of joints in each of the  tarsi  or feet amounting only to three and on the con∣trary in the three others they are five in number notwithstanding that without very close inspection they appear to consist only of four From this circumstance we are of opinion that the Linnaean character while it passes clear of the prolixity of that established by Afzelius is perfectly sufficient "Antennae clavatis biarticulatis clava solida uncinata" Or with the omission of "clava solida" it might be still more applicable  PAUSUS THORACICUS  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Testaceous disk of the shells fuscous thorax bipartite club of the antennae oblong excavated behind cavity oval denticulated at the margin  PAUSUS THORACICUS testaceis coleoptris disco fuscis thorace bipartite clava oblonga postice excavata cavitate ovali marginibus denticulatis  The thorax in this insect is so deeply divided across the middle that it appears at the first sight as if it were really two Hence it is named  thoracicus  but it must be observed at the same time that the fol∣lowing differs very little in this respect the thorax being also very deeply divided P thoracicus and Fichtelii are pretty nearly alike in other respects and may be of the same species differing only in the sex the most striking difference prevails in the structure of the antennae the excavation in one of which is of an oval or rather shuttle shape and in the other pyriform  PAUSUS FICHTELII  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Testaceous wingcases brown testaceous at the anterior and posterior ends thorax somewhat bipartite club of the antennae oblong excavated behind cavity pyriform  PAUSUS FICHTELII testaceus elytris fuscis antice posticeque testaceis thorace subbipartito clava oblonga postice excavata cavitate pyriformi  PAUSUS PILICORNIS  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Testaceous wingcases pitchy thorax bipartite club oblong attenuated incurvated at the tip and beset with a few long hairs  PAUSUS PILICORNIS testaceus elytris piceis thorace bipartito clava oblonga apice attenuata incurva pilis longis sparsis  In the formation of the club composing the second or exterior joint of the antennae this species differs altogether from the others the club is entire or not excavated and is slightly beset with hairs Of this sort Mr Fichtel met with only a solitary specimen as was likewise the case with our  Pausus Fichtelii  Curculio Regalis  Curculio Palmarum  CURCULIO REGALIS  ROYAL CURCULIO  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae clubshaped and inserted in a horny proboscis or snout  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Rostrum short Blue changeable to green velvety or like silk with bands of reddish gold  CURCULIO REGALIS brevirostris corpore viridi sericeo fasciis aureis repandis  Linn Syst Nat    Fab Ent Syst T    p    p    If our ideas of the term regalis will permit its application to any insect we agree with Linnaeus in the appropriate though pompous title bestowed on this species of Curculio It is an aggregate of beauty and splendour of the loveliest coerulean changing alternately to the deeper glow of the violet to green or the transitory sparkling of intermingled silver Every space of blue is constantly contrasted with another of crimson and which as the violet changes to blue or green alters its aspect to a still more vivid expanse of gold Each of those colours the blue and red are distinct for an irregular space of black limits every spot and marking and relieves the whole As the effect of such a combination of colours in this compa∣ratively small species is inconceivably splendid and almost inimitable one figure in the plate is intended to show the natural size and to admit of more perfect delineation another somewhat magnified is added also  This insect which is believed to be  unique  in Great Britain was brought from France in the collec∣tion of MONS DE CALONNE and is in the possession of the author Linnaeus met with it in one of the cabinets on the continent and describes it as a South American insect In the  Entomologia Systematica  the error is corrected and it stands as an Indian species  The Curculio regalis has been figured only in the unfinished productions of a French author on Exotic Coleoptera Olivier and the extreme scarcity of that part of his work which has been published would induce us to add this insect to our Indian species were we uninfluenced by any other motive  CURCULIO PALMARUM  PALM TREE CURCULIO  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Rostrum long Entirely black Thorax broad and flattish Wing cases short and striated

afford higher gratification to the scientific reader than this Fulgora In size it is inferior only to F Lanternaria it is an undoubted nondescript and may be considered as a striking example of the entomological riches of a country hitherto scarcely known the  interior  of  Indostan  It was originally brought from India by the late Governor Holford and is now in the possession of the author He has sought in vain for this species in other cabinets of exotic insects and ventures to deem his specimen  unique  In the course of our remarks on the Fulgora so abundant in China F Candelaria our attention was naturally directed to the astonishing property some insects of this genus are known to possess that of emanating light and it was to this insect we alluded in particular when speaking of one from interior India that enabled us to extend our observations on that property The trunk is large of a dark purple thickly sprinkled with spots of white phosphoric powder and the apex which is scarlet and somewhat pellucid still retains a reddish glow that almost convinces us the creature when living could diffuse light both from the apex and the spots In admitting this conjecture without wandering into the marvellous its nocturnal appearance must be infinitely more singular than either of the known species of Fulgorae Lampyrides or any other luminous insect yet discovered for when on the wing the illuminated apex would resemble a globule of fire or heated iron and the numberless phosphoric spots on the tube form a train of glittering stars to accompany it  As it may be thought improbable that any insect can exhibit such an extraordinary appearance the words of Olivier on some species of Lampyrides may not be unsatisfactory The insects are certainly very distinct but reports of travellers coun∣tenance an opinion that the phosphoric emanations are analogous in the species of both genera 'The phenomena produced by a natural phosphorus is still more wonderful in some foreign species in which the males shine and being provided with wings will produce in their rapid flight a thousand small stars'  Olivier Histoire des Insectes    The only figure of a Fulgora in any respect resembling this species is given in the works of Stohl under the title of  De Groote Goene Coromandelische Lantaarndrager  Pl fig Green Lanterncarrier fly of CoromandelAt the conclusion of the description Stohl says "  In de Neder∣landsche Kabinetten  c c" 'This insect was not known in the cabinets of the low countries till within three years' anno 'during which time a few were brought from Tranquebar on the Coromandel coast to the cabinet of natural curiosities of his Highness the Stadtholder of the United Provinces of which I have been obligingly permitted to take the figure of a female by Mons Vosmar to whom I owe my public acknowledgments for it'  tab    but among other evident specific distinctions we need only notice the structure of the trunk which is altogether different

dried or withered leaf This it may be observed is commonly the appearance of the insect after death such was no doubt the colour of the specimens delineated by Roesel nor can we for a moment hesitate in believing that the insects described by the accurate Linnaeus and Dr Shaw exhibited the like appearance The specimen of the winged insect in our cabinet has been preserved however with more than usual care Immediately after the death of the creature as we have reason to suspect the abdomen had been opened and so nicely excavated that no portion of the entrails or oily fluids which would have inevitably destroyed the true colour was allowed to remain The natural colour is therefore preserved which is not of a pale brown as is commonly imagined but of a delicate lovely green a colour

elytra in our new species de∣serves remark the scutel or rather that portion of the wingcase on the left side that folds over the back when the creature is at rest is of a much stronger texture than any other part of the insect except the thorax and serves as an external covering or defence to the corresponding lobe of the other wingcase which is of a more delicate nature consisting only of a

DIOPSIS ICHNEUMONEA nigra capite abdomine antice pedibusque ferrugineis thorace postice bispinoso  The appearance of this curious insect is peculiarly striking Nothing can be more singular than the disposition of the eyes which are situated at the extremity of two long immoveable pedicles arising from the head most exactly in that part which in other insects bears the antennae In this particular the Diopsis differs not only from other insects of the kindred genera but also from all the other kinds we are acquainted with Some few of the  Cancri  c have indeed the eyes placed at the extremity of elongated pedicles as is for example instanced in the  Cancer angulatus  yet these are obvious dissimilar in construc∣tion for they are moveable at the base and may be directed towards any object at the will of the animal with the utmost facility but to accomplish this the motion of the pedicle in the Diopsis must be neces∣sarily accompanied by that of the head or even of the whole body The eyes of the latter are notwith∣standing so conveniently stationed at the globular extremity of the pedicles as to embrace a far more comprehensive range of sight than is usual with the generality of insects  To the inexperienced entomologist the Diopsis would rather seem to be furnished with remarkable horns and be destitute of eyes although the latter are so very conspicuous when they are pointed out it is on the contrary the true horns or antennae that are so minute as to be most likely to escape attention for each of these consists only of a single setaceous hair or bristle seated on a very small tubercle just beneath the eye  It has been previously intimated in the description of the Pausus denticornis that the first account of the  Diopsis  was inserted in a small tract published by Linnaeus at Upsal in From this we learn that both the Diopsis and the Pausus were found by Andreas Dahl among a parcel of insects in the posses∣sion of Dr Fothergill of London by whom they were sent to Linnaeus These consisted chiefly of insects  collected in North America and Guinea but the habitat either of the Pausus or the Diopsis in particular it is very certain was by no means exactly known Fuesly notwithstanding describes the latter upon this ambiguous authority only as a native of Cayenne and after him Gmelim notes the same insect from South America and Guinea perhaps with as little reason Latreille tells us it is from the coast of Angola on the information of Perrin a zealous naturalist of Bordeaux Our own specimens and they are most assuredly the Diopsis Ichneumonea of Linnaeus were brought from Bengal where it was discovered by Mr Fichtel who has thus established the habitat of this singular creature beyond dispute  Linnaeus to whom only this individual species of Diopsis was known as usual with him under such circumstances does not assign to it any specific character We are acquainted with another species of this genus a native of Africa in the collection of T Marsham Esq which will render our deviation from his example excusable although the latter is at present undescribed  INDEX ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEMATICA NATURAE OF LINNAEUS
