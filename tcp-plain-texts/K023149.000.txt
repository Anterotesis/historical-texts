 A NARRATIVE OF THE METHODâ–ª  c  A NARRATIVE OF THE METHOD BY WHICH THE PRIVATE LETTERS of Mr POPE Have been procur'd and publish'd by  EDMUND CURLL  Bookseller  NB  The Original Papers in  Curl  's own Hand may be seen at  T Cooper  's  LONDON  Printed for T COOPER in  Paternoster Row  MDCCXXXV  A NARRATIVE OF THE METHOD by which Mr Pope's Private Letters were procured and published by EDMUND CURL Bookseller  IT has been judg'd that to clear an Affair which seem'd at first sight a little mysterious and which tho' it concern'd only one Gentleman is of such a Consequence as justly to alarm every Person in the Nation would not only be acceptable as a  Curiosity  but useful as a  Warning  and perhaps flagrant enough as an  Example  to induce the LEGISLATURE to prevent for the future an Enormity so prejudicial to every private Subject and so destructive of Society it self  This will be made so plain by the ensuing Papers that 'twill scarce be needful to attend them with any Reflections more than what every Reader may make  In the Year  Edmund Curl  Bookseller published a Collection of several private Letters of Mr  Pope  to  Henry Cromwell  Esq  which he obtain'd in this Manner  Mr  Cromwell  was acquainted with one Mrs  Thomas  to whom he had the Indiscretion to lend these Letters and who falling into Misfortunes seven Years after sold them to Mr  Curll  without the Consent either of Mr  Pope  or Mr  Cromwell  as appears from the following Letters  To  HENRY CROMWELL  Esq  June  AFTER so long a Silence as the many and great Oppressions I have sigh'd under has occasion'd one is at a Loss how to begin a Letter to so kind a Friend as your self But as it was always my Resolution if I must sink to do it as decently that is as silently as I could So when I found my self plung'd into unforeseen and unavoidable Ruin I retreated from the World and in a manner buried my self in a dismal Place where I knew none nor none knew me In this dull unthinking Way I have protracted a lingering  Death for Life it cannot be called ever since you saw me sequestered from Company deprived of my Books and nothing left to converse with but the Letters of my dead or absent Friends amongst which latter I always placed yours and Mr  Pope  's in the first Rank I lent some of them indeed to an ingenious Person who was so delighted with the Specimen that he importun'd me for a Sight of the rest which having obtain'd he conveyed them to the Press I must not say altogether with my Consent nor wholly without it I thought them too good to be lost in Oblivion and no Cause to apprehend the disobliging of any The Publick  viz  All Persons of Taste and Judgment would be pleased with so agreeable an Amusement Mr  Cromwell  could not be angry since it was but Justice to his Merit to publish the solemn and private Professions of Love Gratitude and Veneration made to him by so celebrated an Author and surely Mr  Pope  ought not to resent the Publication since the early Pregnancy of his Genius was no dishonour to his Character And yet had either of you been ask'd common Modesty would have oblig'd you to refuse what you would not have been displeas'd with if done without your Knowledge and besides to end all  Dispute you had been pleased to make me a free Gift of them to do what I pleased with them And every one knows that a Person to whom a Letter is address'd has the same Right to dispose of it as he has of Goods purchased with his Money I doubt not but your Generosity and Honour will do me the Right of owning by a Line that I came honestly by them I flatter my self in a few Months I shall again be visible to the World and whenever thro' good Providence that Turn shall happen I shall joyfully acquaint you with it there being none more truly your obliged Servant than Sir  Your faithful and most humble Seevant E THOMAS  P S A Letter Sir directed to Mrs  Thomas  to be left at my House will be safely transmitted to her by E CURL  To Mr POPE  Epsom  July  WHEN these Letters were first printed I wonder'd how  Curl  could come by them and could not but laugh at the pompous Title since whatever you wrote to me was Humour and familiar Raillery As soon as I came from  Epsom  I heard you had been to see me and I writ you a short Letter from  Will  's that I long'd to see you Mr  Ds  about that time charg'd me with giving them to a Mistress which I positively denied not in the least at that time thinking of it But some time after finding in the NewsPapers Letters from Lady  Packington  Lady  Chudleigh  and Mr  Norris  to the same  Sapho  or  E T  I began to fear that I was guilty I have never seen these Letters of  Curl  's nor would go to his Shop about them I have not seen this  Sapho  alias  E T  these seven Yearsher writing  That I gave her them to do what she would with them  was straining the Point too far I thought not of it nor do I think she did then But severe Necessity which catches hold of a Twig has produced  all this which has lain hid and forgot by me so many Years  Curl  sent me a Letter last Week desiring a positive Answer about this Matter but finding I would give him none he went to  E T  and writ a Postscript in her long romantick Letter to direct my Answer to his House but they not expecting an Answer sent a young Man to me whose Name it seems is  Pattisson  I told him I should not write any thing but I believed it might be so as she writ in her Letter I am extreamly concern'd that my former Indiscretion in putting them into the Hands of this  Preti  use  should have given you so much Disturbance for the last thing I should do would be to disoblige you for whom I have ever preserved the greatest Esteem and shall ever be Sir  Your faithful Friend and most humble Servant HENRY CROMWELL  To Mr  POPE  August  THO' I writ my long Narrative from  Epsom  till I was tired yet was I not satisfied left any Doubt should rest upon your Mind I could not make Protestations of my Innocence of a grievous Crime but I was impatient till I came to Town that I might send you those Letters as a clear Evidence that I was a perfect Stranger to all their Proceedings Should I have protested against it after the Printing it might have been taken for an Attempt to decry his Purchase and as the little Exception you have taken has serv'd him to play his Game upon us for these two Years a new Incident from me might enable him to play it on for two moreThe great Value she expresses for all you write and her Passion for having them I believe was what prevailed upon me to let her keep them By the Interval of twelve Years at least from her Possession to the Time of printing them 'tis manifest that I had not the least Ground to apprehend such a Design But as People in great Straits bring forth their Hoards of old Gold and most  valuable Jewels so  Sapho  had recourse to her hid Treasure of Letters and plaid off not only yours to me but all those to her self as the Ladies last Stake into the PressAs for me I hope when you shall cooly consider the many thousand Instances of our being deluded by Females since that great Original of  Adam  by  Eve  you will have a more favourable Thought of the undesigning Error of  Your faithful Friend and humble Servant HENRY CROMWELL  This Treatment being extreamly disagreeable to Mr  Pope  he was advised to recal any Letters which might happen to be preserved by any of his Friends particularly those written to Persons deceas'd which would be most subject to such an Accident Many of these were return'd him  Some of his Friends advised him to print a Collection himself to prevent a worse but this he would by no means agree to However as some of the Letters served to revive several past Scenes of Friendship and others to clear the Truth of  Facts  in which  he had been misrepresented by the common Scribblers he was induced to preserve a few of his own Letters as well as of his Friends These as I have been told he inserted in TWO BOOKS some Originals others Copies with a few Notes and Extracts here and there added In the same Books he caused to be copied some small Pieces in Verse and Prose either of his own or his Correspondents which tho' not finish'd enough for the Publick were such as the Partiality of any Friend would be sorry to be depriv'd of  To this Purpose an Amanuensis or two were employ'd by Mr  Pope  when the Books were in the Country and by the Earl of  Oxford  when they were in Town  It happen'd soon after that the  Posthumous Works  of Mr  Wycherly  were publish'd in such a Manner as could no way increase the Reputation of that Gentleman who had been Mr  Pope  's first Correspondent and Friend And several of these Letters so fully shew'd the State of that Case that it was thought but a Justice to Mr  Wycherly  's Memory to print a few to discredit that Imposition These were accordingly transcrib'd for the Press from the  Manuscript Books  abovemention'd  They were no sooner printed but  Edmund Curl  look'd on these too as his Property for a Copy is extant which he corrected in order to another Impression interlin'd and added marginal Notes to in his own Hand  He then advertis'd anew the Letters to Mr  Cromwell  with  Additions  and promis'd Incouragement to all Persons who should send him more  This is a Practice frequent with Booksellers to swell an Author's Works in which they have some Property with any Trash that can be got from any Hand or where they have no such Works to procure some  Curl  has in the same manner since advertiz'd the  Letters  of Mr  Prior  and Mr  Addison  A Practice highly deserving some Check from the Legislature since every such Advertisement is really a  Watchword  to every  Scoundrel  in the Nation and to every  Domestick  of a Family to get a Penny by producing any Scrap of a Man's Writing of what Nature soever or by picking his Master's Pocket of Letters and Papers  A most flagrant Instance of this kind was the Advertisement of an intended Book call'd  Gulliveriana Secunda  where it was promis'd  "that  any Thing  which  any Body  should send as Mr  Pope  's or Dr  Swift  's should be printed and inserted  as Theirs  "  By these honest means Mr  Curl  went on encreasing his Collection and finding as will be seen hereafter by No a further Prospect of doing so he retarded his Edition of Mr  Cromwell  's Letters till the TwentySecond of March and then sent Mr  Pope  the following Letter the first he ever receiv'd from him  No I  SIR  TO convince you of my readiness to oblige you the  Inclosed  is a Demonstration You have as he says disoblig'd a Gentleman the initial Letters of whose Name are  P T  I have some other Papers in the same Hand relating to your  Family  which I will show if you desire a Sight of them Your Letters to Mr  Cromwell  are out of Print and I intend to Print them very beautifully in an  Octavo Volume  I have more to say than is proper to write and if you'll give me a Meeting I will wait on you with Pleasure and close all Differences betwixt you and yours  E CURL  RoseStreet  March  P S I expect the Civility of an Answer or Message  The  Inclos'd  were two Scraps of Paper suppos'd to be  P T  's a feigned Hand the first containing this Advertisement  No II  LEtters of  Alexander Pope  Esq  and several eminent Hands From the Year to Containing a Critical Philological and Historical Correspondence between him and  Henry Cromwell  Esq  William Wycherly  Esq  William Walsh  Esq  William Congreve  Esq  Sir  William Trumbull  Sir  Richard Steele  E O Mr  Addison  M  Craggs  Mr  Gay  Dean  Swift  c with several Letters to Ladies to the Number of two Hundred  N B  The Originals will be shewn at  Ed Curl  's when the Book is Published  The other Paper was a Scrap of some Letter in the same Hand which exprest  "a Dissatisfaction at  Curl  for not having printed his Advertisement"  What more cannot be seen for the rest is cut off close to the Writing  Mr  Pope  's Friends imagin'd that the whole Design of  E Curl  was to get him but to look on the Edition of  Cromwel  's Letters and so to print it as  revis'd  by Mr  Pope  in the same manner as he sent an  obscene Book  to a  Reverend Bishop  and then Advertis'd it as  corrected  and  revis'd  by him Or if there was any such Proposal from  P T Curl  would not fail to embrace it perhaps pay for the Copy with the very Mony he might draw from Mr  P  to suppress it and say  P T  had kept another Copy He therefore answer'd the only way he thought it safe to correspond with him by a publick Advertisement in the  Daily PostBoy  No III  WHereas  A P  hath received a Letter from  E C  Bookseller pretending that a Person the Initials of whose Name are  P T  hath offered the said  E C  to print a large Collection of Mr  P's  Letters to which  E C  requires an Answer  A P  having never had nor intending to have any private Correspondence with the said  E C  gives it him in this Manner That he knows no such Person as  P T  that he believes he hath no such Collection and that he thinks the whole a Forgery and shall not trouble himself at all about it  Ed Curl  return'd an impertinent Answer in the same Paper the next Day denying that he  endeavour'd to correspond with Mr P  and affirming that he wrote by  Direction  but declaring that he would  instantly print the said Collection  In a few Days more he publish'd the  Advertisement of the Book  as above with this Addition  "  E C  as before in the like Case will be faithful"  He now talk'd of it every where said  "That  P T  was a LORD or a PERSON of CONSEQUENCE who printed the Book at a  great Expence  and sought no Profit but  Revenge  on Mr  Pope who had offended him"  particularly  "That some of the Letters would be such as both  Church  and  State would take Notice of  but that  P T  would by no means be known in it that he never would once be  seen  by him but treated in a very  secret Manner"  He told some Persons that sifted him in this Affair  "that he had convers'd only with his Agent a Clergyman of the Name of  Smith  who came as he said from  Southwark"  With this Person it was that  Curl  transacted the Affair who before all the Letters of the Book were delivered to  Curl  insisted on the Letters of  P T  being return'd him to secure him from all possibility of a Discovery as appears from No    Mr  Pope  on hearing of this  Smith  and finding when the Book came out that several of the  Letters  could only have come from the  Manuscript  Book beforemention'd publish'd this Advertisement  WHEREAS a Person who signs himhimself  P T  and another who writes himself  R Smith  and passes for a Clergyman have Transacted for some time past with  Edm Curl  and have in combination printed the  Private Letters  of Mr  Pope  and his Correspondents some of which could only be procured from his own Library or that of a Noble Lord and which have given a Pretence to the publishing others as his which are not so as well as Interpolating those which are This is to advertise that if either of the said Persons will discover the Whole of this Affair he shall receive a Reward of  Twenty Guineas  or if he can prove he hath acted by  For  Curl  had said in his Advertisement that he wrote to Mr P  By Direction  and another of his drawing up of Mr  Pope's Life  began thus  By Direction    Direction of any other  and of  what Person  he shall receive double that Sum  Whether this Advertisement or the future Quarrel of  Curl  and  Smith  about Profits produced  what follow'd we cannot say but in a few Days the ensuing Papers being the whole Correspondence of  P T  and  Edm Cur  were sent to the Publisher  T Cooper  which we shall here lay before the Reader They begin as high as  No IV  Mr CURL  October the  th    UNderstanding you propose to write the  Life  of  Mr Pope  this is only to inform you I can send you diverse Memoirs which may be serviceable if your Design be really to do him neither Injustice nor shew him Favour I was well acquainted with his Father and with the first part of his own Life tho' since he has treated me as a Stranger It is certain some late Pamphlets are not fair in respect to his Father who was of the younger Branch of a Family in good Repute in  Ireland  and related to the Lords  Downe  formerly of the same Name He was as he hath told me himself and he was very different from his Son a modest and plain honest Man a Posthumous Son and left little provided for his elder Brother having what small Estate there was who afterwards Study'd and dy'd at  Oxford  He was put  to a Merchant in  Flanders  and acquir'd a moderate Fortune by Merchandize which he quitted at the Revolution in very good Circumstances and retir'd to  Windsor  Forrest where he purchas'd a small Estate and took great Delight in Husbandry and Gardens His Mother was one of seventeen Children of  W Turnor  Esq  formerly of  Burfit Hall  in theRiding of  Yorkshire  Two of her Brothers were kill'd in the Civil Wars This is a true Account of Mr  Pope  's Family and Parentage Of his Manners I cannot give so good an one yet as I would not wrong any Man both ought to be True

Course of your Life and I intend him the like for his Conduct towards me  A propos  to his Life there have lately fall'n into my Hands a large Collection of his  Letters  from the former Part of his

of Opinion these alone will contain his whole History if you add to them what you formerly printed of those to  Henry Cromwell  Esq  Here a part of the Letter is cut off and the following Words indors'd by Curl  But you must put out an Advertisement for otherwise I shall not be justify'd to some People who have  Influence  and on whom I have some  Dependance  unless it seem to the Publick Eye as no entrie Act of mine but I may be justify'd and excus'd if after they see such a Collection is made by you I acknowledge I sent some Letters to contribute thereto They who know what hath pass'd betwixt Mr  Pope  and me formerly may otherwise think it dishonourable I should set such a thing afoot Therefore print the Advertisement I sent you and you shall instantly hear from or see me

Instant where I was to see the Sheets dealing thus as you truly call it in the Dark  April  You put off this Meeting  fearing a Surprize from Mr  Pope  How should he know of this Appointment unless you gave him Notice I fear no such Besettings either of him or his Agents That the paying of  seventyfive  Pounds would bring you to Town in a Fortnight would I be so silly as to declare it By your last Letter of last Night a Gentleman is to be at my Door at Eight this Evening who has full Commission from you  You want seventyfive Pounds for a Person you would serve That Sum I can easily pay if I think the Purchase would be of any Service to me But in one Word Sir I am engaged all this Evening and shall not give my self any further Trouble about such jealous groundless and dark Negociations

FreeMasons  P T  are not I dare say the true Initials of your Name or if they were Mr  Pope  has publickly declar'd  That he knows no such Person as  P T how then can any thing you have communicated to me discover you or expose you to his Resentment  I have had Letters from another Correspondent who subscribes himself  E P  which I shall print as Vouchers in Mr  Pope's  Life as well as those from

new Edition of his Letters to Mr  Cromwell  and offer'd him the Revisal of the Sheets hoping likewise that it was now time to close all former Resentments which ON HONOURABLE TERMS I was ready to do I told him likewise I had a large Collection of others of his Letters which  from your two Years Silence on that Head I thought was neither unjust nor dishonourable  No XII  I Cannot send the  P T'  s Letters to  Curl  Letters now because I have them not all by me but either this Evening or Tomorrow you  shall not fail of them for some of them are in a Scrutore of mine out of Town and I have sent a

Estimate and Letters you shall have together but I desire the Bearer may bring me fifty more Books Pray come to Night if you can  I am faithfully yours E CURL  For the Reverend Mr  Smith  half an Hour past Ten  Curl  was now so elated with his Success the Books in his Hands and as he thought the Men too that he raised the Style of his Advertisement which he publish'd on the th of  May  in these Words in the  Daily PostBoy  No XIII  THIS Day are published and most beautifully printed Price five Shillings Mr Pope's  Literary Correspondence  for  thirty  Years from to Being a Collection of

at Two Afternoon on  Saturday  I did not receive till past Ten at Night The  Title  will be done to Day and according to your Promise I fully depend on the Books and MSS Tomorrow I hope you have seen the  PostBoy  and  By this it appears it was of  Curl  's own drawing up which he deny'd to the Lords  approve the  Manner  of the Advertisement  I shall think every Hour a  long Period of Time till I have more Books and see you being Sir  For the Reverend Mr  Smith    Sincerely yours E CURL  But the Tables now began to turn It happened that the  Booksellers Bill  for so it was properly called tho' entitled An  Act for the better Encouragement of Learning  came on this Day in the House of Lords Some of their Lordships having seen an Advertisement of so  strange a Nature  thought it very unfitting such a Bill should pass without a  Clause  to prevent such an enormous  License  for the future And the Earl of  Iy  having read it to the House observed further that as it pretended to publish several Letters to  Lords  with the  respective Answers of each Correspondent  it was a  Breach of Privilege and  contrary to a standing Order of the House Whereupon it was order'd that the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod do forthwith seize the the Impression of the said Book and that the said  E Curl  with  J Wilford  for whom the  Daily PostBoy  is printed do attend the House Tomorrow And it was also order'd that the  Bill for the better Encouragement of Learning  be read a second time on this Day Sevennight  By THIS INCIDENT THE BOOKSELLERS BILL WAS THROWN OUT  May  The Order made Yesterday upon Complaint of an Advertisement in the  PostBoy  of the Publication of a Book entitled Mr  Pope  's  Literary Correspondence for thirty Years past  being read Mr  Wilford  the Publisher and Mr  E Curl  were severally called in and examined and being withdrawn  Order'd That the Matter of the said Complaint be refer'd to a Committee to meet Tomorrow and that  E Curl  do attend the said Committee And that the Black Rod do attend with some of the said Books  May    P T  writes to  Curl  on the unexpected Incident of the Lords to instruct him in his Answers to their Examination and with the utmost Care to conceal himself to this effect  No XV  THAT he congratulates him on his Victory over the  Lords  the  Pope  and the  Devil  that the Lords could not touch a Hair of his Head if he continued to behave boldly that it would have a better Air in him to own the  Printing  as well as the  Publishing  since he was no more punishable for  one than for the other that he should answe  nothing more to their Interrogatories tha  that he receiv'd the Letters from  different Hands  that some of them he  bought  other  were  given him  and that some of the  Originals he had  and the rest he  should shortly have  P T  tells him further  That he shall soon take off the  Mask  he complains of that he is not a  MAN OF QUALITY  as he imagined but one  conversant with such  and was concern'd particularly with a noble Friend of Mr  Pope  's in preparing for the Press the Letters to Mr  Wycherly  that he caused a Number over and above to be printed having from that time conceived the Thought of publishing a Volume of  P's  Letters which he went on with and order'd as nearly as possible  to resemble That Impression  But this was only  in ordine ad  to another more material Volume of his Correspondence with Bishop  Atterbury  and the late Lord  Oxford  and  Bolingbroke  And he confesses he made some  Alterations  in these Letters with a  View to those  which Mr  Curl  shall certainly have if he behaves as he directs and every way conceals  P T  We have not this original Letter but we hope Mr  Curl  will print it if not it can only be for this Reason That as it preceded their Quarrel but one Day it proves the Letters to Bishop  Atterbury  Lord  Bollingbroke  c cannot be in  Curl  's Hands tho' he has pretended to advertise them  The next Day  Curl  answers him thus  No XVI  Thursday ManÃ¨  th  May  Dear Sir  I Am just again going to the Lords to finish  Pope  I desire you to send me the Sheets to perfect the first fifty Books and likewise the remaining three hundred Books and pray be at the  Standard  Tavern this Evening and I will pay you twenty pounds more My Defence is right I only told the Lords I did not know from whence the Books came and that my Wife receiv'd them This was strict Truth and prevented all further Enquiry The  Lords declar'd  they had been made  Pope  's  Tool  I put my self upon this single Point and insisted as there was not any Peer's Letter in the Book I had not been guilty of any Breach of Privilege  Lord  DELAWAR  will be in the Chair by Ten this Morning  and the House will be up before ThreeI depend that the Books and the Imperfections will be sent and believe of  P T  what I hope he believes of me  For the Reverend Mr  Smith  The Book was this Day produc'd and it appearing that contrary to the Advertisement there were no Letters of Lords contain'd in it and consequently not falling under the Order of the House the Books were redeliver'd  At the same time  Curl  produc'd and shew'd to several of the Lords the  foregoing Letter  of  P T  which seems extraordinary unless they had begun to quarrel about  Profits  before that Day But after it it is evident from the next Letter that they had an Information of his Willingness to betray them and so get the whole Impression to himself  No XVII To the Reverend Mr  Smith  Rose Street  past Three  Friday May  SIR  I Am falsly accus'd I value not any Man's Change of Temper I will never change MY VERACITY for Falshood in owning a Fact of which I am Innocent I did not own the Books came from  across the Water  nor ever  nam'd you  all I said was that the Books came  by Water  When the Books were seiz'd I sent my Son to convey a Letter  to you and as you told me every body knew you in  Southwark  I bid him make a  strict Enquiry  as I am sure you wou'd have done in such an Exigency Sir I HAVE ACTED JUSTLY in this Affair and that is what I shall always think wisely I will be kept no longer in the Dark  P T  is  Will o' the Wisp  all the Books I have had are Imperfect the First had no Titles nor Prefaces the last Bundles seiz'd by the Lords contain'd but in each Bundle which amounts to and is in all but Books As to the Loss of a Future Copy I despise it nor will I be concern'd with any more such dark suspicious Dealers But now Sir I'll tell you what I will do when I have the Books perfected which I have already receiv'd and the rest of the Impression I will pay you for them But what do you call this Usage First take a Note for a Month and then want it to be chang'd for one of Sir  Richard Hoare  'sMy Note is as good for any Sum I give it as the BANK and shall be as punctually paid I always say  Gold is better than Paper  and  l  I will pay if the Books are perfected to morrow Morning and the rest sent or to Night is the same thing to me But if this dark converse goes on I will Instantly  reprint the whole Book  and as  a Supplement to it  all the Letters  P T  ever sent me  of which I have  exact copies  together with  all your Originals  and give them in upon Oath to my Lord Chancellor You talk of  Trust P T  has not repos'd any in me for he has my Mony and Notes for imperfect Books Let me see Sir either  P T  or your self or you'll find the  Scots  Proverb verify'd  Nemo me impune lacessit  Your abus'd humble Servant E CURL  P S LordI attend this Dayâ–ª LORD DELAWAR I SUP WITH TO NIGHT Where  Pope  has one Lord I have twenty  Mr  Curl  just after in the  London Post  or  Daily Advertiser  printed this Advertisement  No XVIII  MR  Pope's  Litterary Correspondence c with a Supplement of the  Initial Correspondence  of  P T E P R S c  To which in two Days more his Correspondents return'd the following  No XIX  TO manifest to the World the Insolence of  E Curl  we hereby declare that neither  P T  much less  R S  his Agent ever did give or could pretend to give any Title whatever in Mr  Pope  's Letters to the said  E Curl  and he is hereby challeng'd to produce any Pretence to the Copy whatsoeverWe help'd the said  E Curl  to the Letters and join'd with him on Condition he should pay a certain Sum for the Books  as he sold them  accordingly the said  E Curl  receiv'd Books which he sold Perfect and Imperfect at  shill  each and for all which he never paid more than Guineas and gave  Notes  for the rest which prov'd  not Negotionable  Besides which  P T  was perswaded by  R S  at the Instigation of  E Curl  to pay the Expence of the whole Impression  viz    l  no part whereof was repaid by the said  Curl  Therefore every Bookseller will be indemnify'd every way from any possible Prosecution or Molestation of the said  E Curl  and whereas the said  E Curl  threatens to publish our Correspondence and as much as in him lies to  betray his Benefactors  we shall also publish  his Letters to us  which will open a Scene of Baseness and foul Dealing that  will sufficiently show to Mankind his Character and Conduct  May d  P T R S  The Effect of this Quarrel has been the putting into our Hands all the Correspondence above which having given the Reader to make what Reflections he pleases on we have nothing to add but our hearty Wishes in which we doubt not every honest Man will concur that the next  Sessions  when the BOOKSELLERS BILL shall be again brought in the Legislature will be pleas'd not to  extend  the  Privileges  without at the same Time  restraining the Licence of Bookellers  Since in a Case so  notorious  as the printing a Gentleman's PRIVATE LETTERS most Eminent both  Printers  and  Booksellers  conspired to assist the Pyracy both in printing and in vending the same  P S  We are Inform'd that notwithstanding the Pretences of  Edmund Curl  the Original Letters of Mr  Pope  with the PostMarks upon them remain still in the Books from whence they were copy'd and that so many Omissions and Interpolations have been made in this Publication as to render it Impossible for Mr  P  to own them in the Condition they appear  FINIS
