 TWO TALES  AN Impossible Thing A TALE  LONDON  Printed And Sold by J ROBERTS in  WarwickLane  MDCCXX  AN IMPOSSIBLE THING A  TALE  _TO thee Dear  Dick  this Tale I send  Both as a Critick and a Friend  I tell it with some Variation  Not altogether a Translation  From  La Fontaine  an Author  Dick  Whose Muse would touch thee to the quick  The Subject is of that same kind  To which thy Heart seems most inclin'd  How Verse may alter it God knows  Thou lov'st it well I'm sure in Prose  So without Preface or Pretence  To hold thee longer in Suspence  I shall proceed as I am able  To the Recital of my Fable  A  Goblin  of the merry Kind  More black of Hue than curst of Mind  To help a Lover in Distress  Contriv'd a Charm with such Success  That in short Space the cruel Dame  Relented and return'd his Flame  The Dargain made betwixt 'em both  Was bound by Honour and by Oath  The Lover laid down his Salvation  And  Satan  stak'd his Reputation  The Latter promis'd on his Part  To serve his Friend and shew his Art  That Madam shou'd by twelve a Clock  Tho' hitherto as hard as Rock  Become as gentle as a Glove  And kiss and coo like any Dove  In short the Woman should be his  That is upon Condition  Viz  That He the Lover after tasting  What one wou'd wish were everlasting  Should in Return for such Enjoyment  Supply the Fiend with fresh Employment  That's all quoth  Pug  my poor Request  Is only never to have Rest  You thought 'tis like with Reason too  That I should have been serv'd not You  But what upon my Friend impose  Notho' a Devil none of those  Your Business then pray understand me  Is nothing more but to Command me  Of one thing only let me warn ye  Which somewhat nearly may concern ye  As soon as e'er one Work is done  Strait name a new one and so on  Let each to other quick succeed  Or elseyou know how 'tis agreed  For if thro' any Hums or Haws  There haps an intervening Pause  In which for Want of fresh Commands  Your Slave obsequious Idle stands  Nor Soul nor Body ever more  Shall serve the Nymph whom you adore  But both be laid at  Satan  's Feet  To be dispos'd as he thinks meet  At once the Lover all approves  For who can hesitate that loves  And thus he argues in his Thought  Why after all I venture nought  What Mystery is in Commanding  Does that require Much Understanding  Indeed wer't my Part to Obey  He'd go the better of the Lay  But he must do what I think fit  Pshaw pshaw young  Belzebub  is bit  Thus pleas'd in Mind he calls a Chair  Adjusts and combs and courts the Fair  The Spell takes Place and all goes right  And happy he employs the Night  In sweet Embraces balmy Kisses  And riots in the Bliss of Blisses  O Joy cry'd he that hast no Equal  But holdno Rapturesmark the Sequel  For now when near the Morning's Dawn  The Youth began as 'twere to yawn  His Eyes a silky Slumber seiz'd  Or would have done if  Pug  had pleas'd  But that officious  Demon  near  Now buzz'd for Business in his  Ear  In Haste he names a thousand Things  The  Goblin  plys his wicker Wings  And in a Trice returns to ask  Another and another Task  Now Palaces are built and Tow'rs  The Work of Ages in few Hours  Then Storms are in an Instant rais'd  Which the next Moment are appeas'd  Now Show'rs of Gold and Gems are rain'd  As if each  India  had been drain'd  And He in one astonish'd View  Sees both  Golconda  and  Peru  These Things and stranger Things than these  Were done with equal Speed and Ease  And now to  Rome  poor  Pug  he'll send  And  Pug  soon reach'd his Journey's End  And soon return'd with such a Pack  Of Bulls and Pardons at his Back  That now the Squire who had some Hope  In holy Water and the Pope  Was out of Heart and at a Stand  What next to wish and what command  Invention flags his Brain grows muddy  And black Despair succeeds brown Study  In this Distress the woful Youth  Acquaints the Nymph with all the Truth  Begging her Counsel for whose Sake  Both Soul and Body were at Stake  And is this all replys the Fair  Let me alone to cure this Care  When next your  Demon  shall appear  Pray give himlook what I hold here  And bid him labour soon or late  To lay these Ringlets lank and strait  Then something scarcely to be seen  Her Finger and her Thumb between  She held and sweetly smiling cry'd  Your  Goblin  's Skill shall now be try'd  She said and gavewhat shall I call  That Thing so shining crisp and small  Which round his Finger strove to twine  A Tendril of the  Cyprian  Vine  Or Sprig from  Cytherea  's Grove  Shade of the Labyrinth of Love  With Awe he now takes from her Hand  That Fleecelike Flow'r of fairy Land  Less precious whilom was the Fleece  Which drew the  Argonauts  from  Greece  Or that which modern Ages see  The Spur and Prize of Chivalry  Whose Curls of kindred Texture grace  Heroes and Kings of  Spanish  Race  The Spark prepar'd and  Pug  at Hand  He issues thus his strict Command  This Line thus Curve and thus Orbicular  Render direct and perpendicular  But so direct that in no sort  It ever may in Rings retort  See me no more 'till this be done  Hence to thy Taskavaunt be gone  Away the Fiend like Lightning flys  And all his Wit to Work applys  Anvils and Presses he employs  And dins whole Hell with hamm'ring Noise  In vain he to no Terms can bring  One Twire of that reluctant Thing  Th' elastic Fibre mocks his Pains  And it's first spiral Form retains  New Stratagems the Sprite co  ves  And down the Depths of Sea he dives  This Sprunt its Pertness sure will lose  When laid said he to soak in Ooze  Poor foolish Fiend he little knew  Whence  Venus  and her Garden grew  Old Ocean with paternal Waves  The Child of his own Bed receives  Which oft as dipt new Force exerts  And in more vig'rous Curls reverts  So when to Earth  Alcides  flung  The huge  AntÃ«us  whence he sprung  From ev'ry Fall fresh Strength he gain'd  And with new Life the Fight maintain'd  The bafled  Goslin  grows perplex'd  Nor knows what Sleight to practise next  The more he trys the more he fails  Nor Charm nor Art nor Force avails  But all concur his Shame to show  And more exasperate the Foe  And now he pensive turns and sad  And looks like melancholick mad  He rolls his Eyes now off now on  That wonderful  Phenomenon  Sometimes he twists and twirls it round  Then pausing meditates profound  No End he sees of his Surprize  Nor what it should be can devise  For never yet was Wooll or Feather  That cou'd stand buff against all Weather  And unrelax'd like this resist  Both Wind and Rain and Snow and Mist  What Stuff or whence or how 'twas made  What Spinster Witch could spin such Thread  He nothing knew but to his Cost  Knew all his Fame and Labour lost  Subdu'd abash'd he gave it o'er  'Tis said he blush'd 'tis sure he swore  Not all the Wiles that Hell could hatch  Could conquer that SUPERB MUSTACH  Defeated thus thus discontent  Back to the Man the  Demon  went  I grant quoth he our Contract null  And give you a Discharge in full  But tell me now in Name of Wonder  Since I so candidly knock under  What is this Thing Where could it grow  Pray take it'tis in  Statu quo  Much Good may't do you for my Part  I wash my Hands of't from my Heart  In Truth Sir  Goblin  or Sir  Fairy  Replys the Lad you're too soon weary  What leave this trifling Task undone  And think'st Thou this the only one  Alas were this subdu'd thou'dst find  Millions of more such still behind  Which might employ ev'n to Eternity  Both you and all your whole Fraternity  THE PEASANT in Search of his HEIFER A  TALE  After M  De la Fontaine  _IT so befell a silly Swain  Had sought his Heifer long in vain  For wanton she had frisking stray'd  And left the Lawn to seek the Shade  Around the Plain he rolls his Eyes  Then to the Wood in Haste he hies  Where singling out the fairest Tree  He climbs in Hopes to hear or see  Anon there chanc'd that Way to pass  A jolly Lad and buxom Lass  The Place was apt the Pastime pleasant  Occasion with her Forelock present  The Girl agog the Gallant ready  So lightly down he lays my Lady  But so she turn'd or so was said  That she some certain Charms display'd  Which with such Wonder struck his Sight  With Wonder much more with Delight  That loud he cry'd in Rapture What  What see I Gods What see I not  But nothing nam'd from whence 'tis guess'd  'Twas more than well could be express'd  The Clown aloft who lent an Ear  Strait stopt him short in mid Career  And louder cry'd Ho honest Friend  That of thy seeing seest no End  Dost see the Heifer that I seek  If do'st pray be so kind to speak  FINIS
