Acquaintance of the Reader in no very advantageous Situation  ABOUT the middle of July when the Windsor stagecoach with the accustomed number of passengers was proceeding on its way to London a young woman genteely dressed with a small parcel tied up in her handkerchief hastily bolted from the shelter of a large tree near the road and calling to the coachman to stop for a moment asked him if he could let her have a place The man although he well knew his vehicle was already sufficiently crouded yet being desirous of appropriating this supernumerary fare to himself replied that he did not doubt but he could find room for her and jumping off his box begged the company to sit close and give the young woman a place  "What do you mean" said a jolly fat woman with a face as red as scarlet  Have you not got your usual number of passengers Do you think we will be stifled with heat to put money into your pocket  There is room enough for such a slender young body as this  said the coachman  if you would but sit closer  "Sit closer" repeated the dame and spreading her cloaths  Don't you see we are crouded to death how dare you pretend to impose another passenger upon us when your coach is already full  "Well" said a tall lean woman who sat next her  This is the first time I ever travelled in a stagecoach and truly I am sick of it already There is no bearing the insults one is exposed to in these carriages Prithee young woman  pursued she with an air of great contempt  Go about your business you see there is no room for you And do you fellow get on your box and drive on  "Fellow me no fellows" said the coachman in a surly tone  I won't drive till I please Who are you pray that takes so much upon you to order me  Who am I you saucy Jackanapes said the lady a person thatbut I shall not demean myself so much as to tell you who I am it is my misfortune to be stuffed up in a stagecoach at presentwhat I have never been used to I assure you  "Good lackaday" said the fat gentlewoman with a sneer  A great misfortune truly I would have you to know madam your betters ride in stagecoaches Here's a coil indeed with such wouldbe gentry  "Good woman" said the other with an affected calmness  Pray don't direct your impertinent discourse to me I have nothing to say to you  "No more a good woman than yourself" said the plump lady with a face doubly inflamed with rage "I scorn your words"  "Very likely" said a grave man who sat on the opposite side  but I wish it was possible to make room for the young gentlewoman  "Ah God bless your honour"  said the coachman I thought you could not find in your heart to let such a pretty young woman as this walk  "Pretty" exclaimed the haughty lady  You are a fine judge of beauty indeed but I will not submit to be crouded fellow so  you and your pretty passenger may ride on the coachbox if you please  "Nay since you come to that" says the fat gentlewoman  I am resolved you shall not have your own way The young lady may be as good as you and she shall not be obliged to ride on the coachbox So open the door coachman  said she shoving her antagonist at the same time with all her force"Here is room enough"  A young gentlewoman in a ridinghabit who sat on the same side but next the window declared that she was willing to give part of her seat to the stranger and begged the haughty lady to yield "Poh" said the rosy matron  don't stand begging and praying her since you are on my side we will be too hard for her I warrant you  Saying this she put one of her huge arms round the young woman's waist and thus reinforced shoved her neighbour so forcibly against the other window that she cried out with pain and vexation  The young lady without who had been the occasion of this contest and who had hitherto stood silent with her hat over her eyes alarmed by the screams of her foe raised her head and in a tone of voice so sweet as immediately fixed the attention of the whole company intreated  them not to quarrel upon her account it was indeed she said of great consequence to her to be admitted but she would not continue to desire it since her request had produced so much uneasiness among them  The passengers who occupied the other side of the coach were two men and a woman big with child which circumstance had made it impossible for the men to offer her a seat with them for fear of incommoding the pregnant woman But the youngest of the men having now got a glimpse of the stranger's face declared that the ladies might make themselves easy for he would resign his seat adding that he was extremely glad he had an opportunity of obliging such a handsome lady He then jumped out of the coach and taking the stranger's hand to help her in stared confidently under her hat which put her into a little confusion however she thanked him very politely and accepted his offer but not without expressing some concern for the manner in which he would dispose of himself  "Oh madam" said the coachman  the gentleman may sit upon the box with me and he will have the pleasure of viewing the beautiful prospects all the way we go    I shall see none so beautiful  said the young fellow  as what they who remain in the coach will behold  The fair stranger now blushed more than before and being willing to avoid any farther speeches of this nature she hastily got into the coach thanked the young man a second time who having seen her seated placed himself by the coachman on the box and they proceeded on their journey  CHAP II  The commencement of a violent friendship between two young ladies which has the usual consequences a communication of secrets by which the reader is let into part of Henrietta's story  A Profound silence now prevailed among the company in the coach the eyes of all were fastened upon the fair stranger who appeared wholly insensible of the scrutinizing looks of her fellowtravellers Something within herself seemed to engross all her thoughts and although by her eyes being constantly turned towards the windows of the coach it might be imagined the passing objects drew her attention yet their fixed looks too plainly indicated that they were beheld without observation Her  person though full of charms and the easy gracefulness of her air impressed less respect for her on the minds of the women than the elegance of her morningdress which they were now at leisure to consider Her gown was a white sprig'd muslin extremely fine through which shone a rich blue Mantua silk petticoat her cap handkerchief and ruffles were trimmed with fine Brussels lace her apron had a broad border round it of Dresden work and a white lutestring hat shaded her charming face which she was solicitous to conceal from view  The melancholy with which she seemed oppressed conciliated to her the good will of her female fellowtravellers though from very different sentiments The haughty lady who had refused to let her have a place in the coach found her envy and illnature insensibly subside by the consideration that this stranger was probably more unhappy than herself  The lusty matron pleased that by insisting upon receiving her she had conferred an obligation on one who appeared to be of a rank above her own enjoyed her present superiority and pitied her from the overflowings of gratified pride  The young lady in the ridinghabit whose vanity had been a little mortified at seeing herself  associated in a journey with persons whom she conceived to be very unfit company for her thought herself very happy in the acquisition of so genteel a fellowtraveller and as she had not deign'd to open her mouth before from an opinion of the meanness of her company she now made herself amends for her silence by addressing a profusion of civil speeches to the fair stranger who replied to every thing she said with extreme politeness but with an all that showed her heart was not at ease  The passengers being set down at different places miss Courteney for that was the name of our fair adventurer remained alone with the young lady in the coach This circumstance seemed to rouze her from a deep revery in which she had been wholly absorbed during the last half hour and looking earnestly at her companion "Ah madam said she" in a most affecting accent "and when am I to lose you" "I shall leave you in a few minutes" said the lady  for I am going no farther than Hammersmith  "Lord bless me" said miss Courteney listing up her fine eyes swimming in tears  What shall I do what will become of me  This exclamation gave great surprize to the other lady who from several circumstances had  conceived there was some mystery in her case "You seem uneasy" said she to miss Courteney  pray let me know if it be in my power to serve you  This kind request had such an effect on the tender heart of miss Courteney that she burst into tears and for a few moments was unable to answer when the lady pressing her to speak freely "I am an unhappy creature madam said she sighing  and am flying from the only person in the world upon whom I have any dependence I will make no scruple to trust you with my secret Did you ever hear of lady Meadows  pursued she  the widow of Sir John Meadows  "I know a lady who is acquainted with her" said the other  she is a woman of fashion and fortune  "Lady Meadows is my relation" resumed miss Courteney  she took me a poor helpless orphan under her protection and during some time treated me with the tenderness of a mother Within these few weeks I have unhappily lost her favour not by any fault of mine I assure you for I have always loved and reverenced her Nothing should have obliged me to take this step which has no doubt an  appearance of ingratitude but the fear of being forced to marry a man I hate  "O heavens my dear creature" exclaimed the lady  What do you tell me were you upon the point of being forced to a detested match  "I was madam" replied miss Courteney  and to this hard lot was I doomed by her to whom I owe all my past happiness and from whom I expected all the future  You have obliged me excessively by this unreserved confidence  interrupted the lady  and you shall find me not unworthy of it From this moment I swear to you an inviolable attachment Sure there is nothing so transporting as friendship and mutual confidence Yon won my heart the moment I saw you I have formed a hundred violent friendships but one accident or other always dissolved them in a short time There are very few persons that are capable of a violent friendship at least I never could find one that answered my ideas of that sort of engagement Have not you been often disappointed tell me my dear I dare say you have Your sentiments I believe are as delicate as mine upon this head I am charmed I am ravished with this meeting Who would have imagined that by chance  and in a stagecoach I should have found what I have so earnestly sought for these three months a person with whom I could contract a violent friendship such as minds like our's are only capable of feeling  I am extremely obliged to you madam for your good opinion  said miss Courteney  I hope I shall never be so unfortunate as to forfeit it indeed I have reason to think that in my present distressed situation a friend is a blessing sent from heaven  "Well but my dear Clelia" said this flighty lady  you have not told me all your story I call you Clelia because you know it is so like common acquaintance to address one another by the title of Miss such a one Romantick names give a spirit to the correspondence between such friends as you and I are but perhaps you may like another name better than Clelia though I think that is a mighty pretty one so soft and gliding Clelia Clelia tell me do you like it my dear  "Call me what you please" said miss Courteney smiling a little at the singularity of her new friend "but my name is Courteney"  "Courteney is a very pretty sirname" said the lady  I hope it is not disgraced with any  odious vulgar christian name such as Molly or Betty or the like  I was christened Henrietta after my mother  said miss Courteney  Henrietta is well enoughreturned the other but positively my dear you must assume the name of Clelia when you write to me for we must correspond every hourOh what a ravishing pleasure is it to indulge the overflowings of one's heart upon paper Remember to call me Celinda in your letters and in all our private conversations we shall have a thousand secrets to communicate to each other But I am impatient to know all your story it must needs be very romantick and pretty  "Alas" said the charming Henrietta  this is no time to relate my misfortunes we are entered into Hammersmith and there you say you must leave me give me your advice dear madam as to the manner in which I must dispose of myself  "  Dear madam  " repeated the lady  is that the style then you resolve to use have you forgot that we have contracted a violent friendship and that I am your Celinda and you my Clelia  "I beg your pardon" said Henrietta  I did not think of that name well then dear Celinda  what would you advise me to do I am going to London there to conceal myself from the search that lady Meadows will doubtless make for me when she hears I have left her house all my hope of a reconciliation with her is through the interposition of a friend I have a brother who has been abroad these ten years and whom I every day expect to hear is arrived but I dare not show myself to any of lady Meadows's acquaintance lest I should be hurried back and sacrificed to what she calls my interest I know so little of the town that I am afraid I may take up my residence in an improper house among people where my honour or at least my reputation may be in danger Direct me dear madam My dear Celinda I would say direct me what to do in this dreadful dilemma  Here she paused anxiously expecting the answer of her new friend which will be found in the following chapter  CHAP III  Which illustrates an observation of Rochefoucault's that in the misfortunes of our friends there is always something that does not displease us  "I Protest my dearest Clelia" said the lady  your fears are very natural upon this occasion I should in your situation be almost distracted Even our parents' watchful cares are hardly sufficient to guard us against the attempts of insolent men how much more then are those attempts to be dreaded when we are left defenceless and exposed Believe me my dear I sympathize truly with you in this misfortune Good Heaven I think I should die with apprehension were I in your case  "Dont terrify me" said miss Courteney trembling  I have taken an imprudent step but I must make the best of it now Providence I hope will be my guard  "I would not terrify you my dear" said the lady  but I must repeat that were I in your case I think my fears would dictract me Thank Heaven I am protected by watchful parents cautious relations and prudent friends  yet hardly thus can I think myself secure from these enterprising wretches the men  This young lady had indeed a stronger protector than all these which she did not mention or perhaps was insensible of and that was the extreme disagreeableness of her whole person Her features it is true could not be called irregular because few faces were ever distinguished with a set more uniformly bad Her complexion which was a composition of green and yellow was marvelously well suited to her features Nor was it possible to make any invidious comparisons between her face and her shape since it was hard to decide which was worse  Miss Courteney who had burst into tears occasioned by her reflections on her own helpless situation compared with the advantages her friend enjoyed and which she had so oftentatiously enumerated was upon the point of soliciting her advice again when the lady joyfully exclaimed  Oh there is my aunt's house my dear Clelia we must part immediately  "Sure" said Henrietta sighing  you will not leave me till you have advised me what to do  "Lord my dear" said the other  one young creature is not qualified to give another advice upon such occasions I wish it was in my power to give you proper advice you know I have vowed to you an inviolable friendship  And  Here the coachman as he had been directed stopped before a large handsome house and a welldressed footman immediately appearing came forwards to open the coachdoor  "Hear me one word" cried miss Courteney perceiving this tender friend was actually going to leave her without any farther solicitude for her safety  upon the strength of that inviolable friendship you have vowed to me I will venture to ask a favour of you it is pursued she that you will recommend me to some person of your acquaintance in London who may direct me to a decent house where I can remain in safety till my brother's arrival  "I vow this is a lucky thought" said the lady  I believe I can serve you my dear Clelia but you must step in with me to my aunt's John  said she to the servant  is my aunt at home  The man told her his lady was just gone to take an airing  "That's well" said the lady  we shall have an opportunity to settle this matter but my dear Clelia I think it will be best to discharge the coach the fellow possibly will not wait I'll send my aunt's servant to take a place for you in the Hammersmith stage which I know does not set out this half hour  Henrietta readily complied overjoyed that she had really found a sincere friend in the person of this whimsical lady who having led her into a large wellfurnished parlour ordered some tea to be brought and then told her that she would give her a letter to her millener who was a very good sort of a woman and where she might depend upon being absolutely safe  "When I was last in town" pursued she  which was about three weeks ago her first floor was empty and in this season of the year I believe she will let it to you for two guineas a week  "A single room will do for me" said miss Courteney  my circumstances do not entitle me to magnificent lodgings and my business is to keep myself private  "Well well my dear be that as you please"  aid the other  I will write the letter without mentioning what lodgings you require  Saying this she called for pens and paper and having wrote the following billet gave it to miss Courteney for her perusal  Dear Mrs EGRET  THE lady who will deliver you this is one for whom I have the most violent friendship imaginable You know how ardent my friendships are but I think I never had any so firmly rooted as this though our acquaintance commenced but a few hours ago This dear friend having desired me to recommend her to some person to lodge with I thought of you knowing you can accommodate her with genteel apartmentsI am dear Mrs Egret  Your humble servant E WOODBY  Henrietta having read the letter returned it again into the hands of her friend gratefully acknowledging the favour although she had some objections to it for she did not approve of the words genteel apartments being resolved not to exceed a very moderate price but she rightly conceived that miss Woodby rather listened to her own pride than her conveniency  by throwing in that circumstance and therefore took no notice of it  The letter being sealed and directed miss Courteney carefully deposited it in her pocket and the two ladies were preparing to drink their tea when the footman entered and said the stagecoach was just going off our fair traveller instantly rose up and took leave of her friend who having prevailed upon her to drink a glass of sack and water since she was disappointed of her tea parted with her with an affectionate embrace and a promise that she would see her in town very shortly  Miss Courteney finding only one passenger in the coach who was a grave elderly woman she resumed her journey with some kind of chearfulness having thus happily got over her apprehensions of falling into bad company where chance might have directed her to lodge  CHAP IV  In which our heroine through inattention falls into the very difficulty she had taken such pains to avoid  BUT this cessation from uneasiness did not last long for the mind which can fasten with violence but upon one circumstance of distress at a time and being suddenly relieved from that is sensible of a calm which compared with its former feelings may be called pleasure yet soon selects another object to engross its attention and fixes on it with equal anxiety and sollicitude Thus it fared with our lovely heroine whose others cares had all been swallowed up in reflections on the danger to which her honour was exposed Eased of these apprehensions by the good offices of miss Woodby she was happy for a few moments till the consequences of her flight rush'd full upon her mind lady Meadows's favour irrecoverable her fortune ruined her reputation blasted This last thought which from the delicacy of her sentiments gave her the deepest regret dwelt most upon her mind and forgetting that she was not alone she clasped  her hands together in a violent emotion and burst into tears  The old gentlewoman who had been eyeing her very attentively not a little surprised at the seriousness that appeared in the looks and behaviour of so young a creature eagerly asked her What was the matter  Henrietta rouzed by this question which so absent had she been first informed her she was observed wiped her eyes and composing her countenance said she was often lowspirited  "Don't tell me of low spirits" said the old  entlewoman  such young bodies as you are not lowspirited for nothing What I warrant you there is a sweetheart in the case  "Oh no madam" said miss Courteney  ushing "no sweetheart I assure you"  "No really" resumed she  well then I suppose you have lost a friend  "I have indeed lost a friend" said the young  dy hoping that acknowledgment would put  end to the questions of her fellowtraveller  "Indeed" said the old woman "and this friend is it a father or mother or sister or  All all" interrupted miss Courteney burst  g again into tears  "How all" repeated the old woman  Have you just now lost all these relations  I lost them all in losing that friend madam  said Henrietta vexed that her sensibility wakened by such questions had made her too little guarded in her expressions  "Oh Oh I understand you child" said the good gentlewomen  this person I don't ask you whether it was a man or woman was to you both father and mother Well and so I suppose you have just heard of the death of this good friend and are going to town on that occasion  Miss Courteney finding that the inquisitive temper of her fellowtraveller was likely to lead her into a discovery of her situation chose rather to be silent than violate truth by feigning circumstances to deceive her and fortunately for her she was prevented from suffering more disagreeable interrogatories by the coach suddenly stopping at an inn in Piccadilly where it put up  The old gentlewoman however at parting asked her what part of the town she was going to and offered if it was in her way to accompany her but Henrietta evaded the question and the offer by telling her that she should take a chair The coachman accordingly called one  for her which she entered immediately and being asked by the chairman where she would please to be carried she recollected with great confusion that miss Woodby had not told her where her millener lived  She now sought for the letter hoping there was a full direction upon that But what was her grief and perplexity when she found the superscription contained only these words  For Mrs Egret  "Good Heaven" exclaimed  he fair unfortunate "what shall I do now  The chairman repeating his question she told him that she had forgot a direction and asked him if he knew where Mrs Egret a millener  ved The fellow replied in the negative but added that he would enquire He accordingly  epped into the nearest shop which was a ha  erdasher's and making a small blunder in the  ame which the person he spoke to mistook for  ccles he was told that the millener he enquired for lived in Charles street  The fellow returned extremely pleased with  is success and relieved the young lady from her  xiety who bid him carry her directly to  harles street and she soon found herself at the  or of a millener's shop where she discharged  r chairmen and entering asked a young  woman whom she saw at work if her mistress was at home  The girl desired her to walk into a parlour where she was met by an agreeable welldressed woman who received her with great politeness and desired to know her commands  "I have a letter for you" said Henrietta putting it into her hands  from a young lady a customer of your's the contents will acquaint you with my business  The millener took the letter and having read it returned it again with a smile saying  She was not the person to whom it was addressed  "No madam" said miss Courteney excessively surprised "Is not your name Egret  "My name is Eccles madam" said the millener "Bless me" cried miss Courteney  the chairmen have made a mistake I bid one of them enquire where Mrs Egret a millener lived and he was directed hither I shall be obliged to you pursued Henrietta if you will let your maid call a chair  "To be sure madam" said the millener  but do you not know where this Mrs Egret lives  I have unfortunately forgot to get a direction  returned the young lady  but I hope you can inform me  "I wish I could madam" said the millener "but really I know no such person as Mrs Egret"  Surely I am the most unfortunate creature in the world  cried Henrietta  "I hope not madam" said Mrs Eccles with a look of great complacency  there are more persons besides Mrs Egret who would be glad to accommodate you with lodgings I wish mine were good enough for you  "Oh I dare say they are good enough" replied miss Courteney  but I was recommended to Mrs Egret and  Pray madam walk up and look at my first floor  said Mrs Eccles and without waiting for any reply immediately led the way  Henrietta followed in such perplexity of mind that she hardly knew what she did and while the officious millener led her from room to room expatiating at large upon the conveniencies miss Courteney continued silent revolving in her thoughts the dilemma to which she was reduced  The evening was so far advanced that she could not think of going in quest of Mrs Egret of whom she could get no information here yet she was not able to resolve upon taking lodgings in the house of a person to whom she was an absolute stranger a misfortune which she had  vainly endeavoured to avoid by the application she had made to miss Woodby  I am afraid you don't like this apartment madam  said Mrs Eccles who observed her look pensive and uneasy  I have no objection to it  said miss Courteney  but that it is rather too good I do not propose to go to a high price a bedchamber and the use of a parlour will be sufficient for me  The millener looked a little dissatisfied at these words but told her she could accommo+date her with a large handsome bedchamber up two pair of stairs but added that she had no other parlour than that which she kept for her own use  Miss Courteney desired to see the room which was indeed very handsome and convenient and the millener perceiving she liked it told her that she should be welcome to the use of the diningroom till her first floor was let  The young lady thought this an obliging proposal and being pleased with the woman's countenance and behaviour ventured to make an agreement with her and every thing being settled upon very easy terms  there is but one difficulty remaining  said she with an engaging smile  and that I know not how we shall get over we are strangers to each other  "Oh madam" interrupted Mrs Eccles  though it is not my custom to take in lodgers without having a character yet I can have no scruple with regard to a lady of your appearance As for me I have  ed a great many years in this neighbourhood and am not afraid of having my character enquired into  She spoke this with a little warmth which made Henrietta imagine she expected the same degree of confidence she had shown so making a merit of necessity she appeared very well satisfied and immediately took possession of her new apartment  CHAP V  Which contains nothing but very common occurrences  MRS Eccles being summoned into her shop by a customer miss Courteney desired her to send up pen ink and paper being resolved to write to miss Woodby that night and acquaint her with the disappointment she had met with The maid soon appeared with candles and all the materials for writing delivering at the same time her mistress's compliments to the  young lady and a request that she would favour her with her company to supper Miss Courteney promised to wait on her provided she was alone and sitting down wrote the following letter to her new friend  YOU will no doubt my dear miss Woodby be both surprised and grieved to know that your kind intentions have been frustrated and that by forgetting to give me a direction your recommendation to Mrs Egret has proved useless to me By a mistake of the chairman who I desired to enquire where Mrs Egret lived I was brought to another millener's and she not being able to direct me where to find her I am obliged to take up my lodging with a stranger It was my apprehensions of what has befallen me that induced me to trust you with my secret a secret of the highest importance to me and most generously did you repay my confidence by your ready assistance It was my ill fortune which ordered it so that I should not profit by your kindness However my gratitude is equally engaged and since I observe nothing disagreeable in the behaviour of the person in whose house I now am I shall endeavour to make myself easy here till I hear from you I long to see you  to tell you my unhappy story to have your compassion or rather to be justified by your approbation of what I have been compelled by circumstances to do Oh my dear miss how unhappy is that mind which with right intentions feels a consciousness of something wrong in its resolutions Direct for me by the name of Benson at Mrs Eccles's millener in Charles street Adieu I sign the pretty name you gave me  CLELIA  Henrietta had just sealed her letter when somebody tapp'd at her door she opened it immediately and seeing Mrs Eccles asked her pardon for not waiting on her before Mrs Eccles told her that her little supper being ready she came to see if she was at leisure  Miss Courteney found the cloth laid in the parlour and an elegant supper was served up Mrs Eccles did not fail to apologize frequently for the meanness of her entertainment and was gratified with as many assurances from her fair guest that no apology was necessary During the repast Mrs Eccles entertained her with an account of the newest fashions the most celebrated performers of the opera and playhouses little pieces or scandal and the like topicks of  conversation which Henrietta had often heard discussed among her more polite acquaintance and indeed almost the only ones that engage the attention during the recess of the cardtable  The millener then turning the discourse to the accident that procured her so agreeable a lodger artfully pursued her hints till the young lady found herself obliged to satisfy in some degree her curiosity concerning her situation  Though she was naturally communicative even to a fault yet she did not think proper to disclose herself farther than to tell her that she had been obliged to come to London upon some affairs of consequence which could not be settled till the arrival of her brother who was every day expected from his travels  This account was so near the truth that miss Courteney in the simplicity of her own heart thought it could not fail of being believed However the millener who knew the world very well conceived there was something extraordinary in the case nothing less than a loveintrigue nor did this suspicion give her any uneasiness She was one of those convenient persons with whom a lady upon paying a certain sum of money might liein privately and be properly attended She made no scruple of accommodating with lodgings a young wife whose  husband for certain family reasons visits her only now and then and as she generally sound her account in such sort of lodgers she seldom desired and indeed was seldom encumbered with any other  The youth beauty and elegance of miss Courteney the introductory letter so oddly conceived her apparent perplexity and concern upon her disappointment of the lodgings she had expected raised suspicions which the story she now heard confirmed and not doubting but this affair would prove beneficial to her she exerted her utmost endeavours to please her fair lodger and engage her to an entire confidence  When the clock struck eleven Henrietta rose up in order to retire to her own chamber to which Mrs Eccles officiously attended her having taken leave of her at the door she bolted it on the inside and after recommending herself to the protection of Heaven went to bed but not to rest A thousand disquietudes kept her waking till the morning when she sunk into a slumber that lasted till eleven o'clock  As soon as she opened her eyes she was informed by the strong light in her chamber that the morning was far advanced and finding by her watch which lay on a chair near her bedside how much she had exceeded her usual time for  she was a very early riser she hurried on her cloaths and went down stairs being extremely anxious to get her letter sent to miss Woodby she went directly into the shop supposing she should find Mrs Eccles there but was excessively surprised to hear from the apprentice that her mistress was not yet up  "I suppose" said miss Courteney  she rested no better than myself last night which was the cause of my lying so late this morning  "La ma'am" replied the girl  my mistress is never up before eleven or twelve  "Indeed" said the young lady dissembling her concern at a circumstance which gave her no favourable opinion of her landlady  But madam  added the girl  you may have your breakfast whenever you please to order it  She then called the maid whom miss Courteney ordered to fetch a porter being determined to have her letter delivered into miss Woodby's own hands if possible A porter was soon found who undertook to carry the letter to Hammersmith as directed and this affair being dispatched Henrietta ordered some coffee for her breakfast and retired to her own chamber  CHAP VI  In which miss Woodby again makes her appearance  IN about a quarter of an hour Mrs Eccles appeared in a long loose linen sack being her morning dress and insisted upon miss Courteney's breakfasting with her who at length consented having agreed to pay at the rate of a guinea a week for her board during the time she stayed which she inly determined should not be long  After the teathings were removed she went into the shop to make a purchase of some ribbons and gloves and while she was amusing herself with looking over a great variety of fashionable trifles which the apprentice officiously shewed her a young gentleman who had been attracted by her appearance came into the shop and asked to look at some Dresden ruffles Henrietta blushing at the earnestness with which he gazed on her retired immediately telling Mrs Eccles as she passed through the parlour that there was a gentleman in the shop The millener upon this information lifted up her hands mechanically to her head to adjust her hair  and hastened to attend her customer while her fair lodger taking a book that lay in the window went to her own apartment with an intention to amuse herself with reading till the long'dfor return of her messenger  The book however which was a volume of the new Atalantis did not suit her taste she threw it away and abandoned herself to her own melancholy reflections which were at length interrupted by her landlady who entered the room with a smiling air telling her she had had a very good customer  "I am glad of it" said Henrietta  "Truly" said Mrs Eccles  I believe I am obliged to your fair face for my good luck this morning  "How" returned the young lady with a countenance graver than before  "Nay never wonder at it" said Mrs Eccles"  the gentleman laid out twelve guineas with me but I don't believe he wanted the things he bought You were the loadstone  added she smartly  that drew him into the shop He asked me a hundred questions about you  "I am sorry for it" said miss Courteney "I wish I had not been in the shop"  And why sorry pray  resumed Mrs Eccles  I warrant you are sorry you are handsome too  However I have another thing to tell you to increase your sorrow and that is that you have certainly made a conquest of this fine spark and to overwhelm you with affliction  pursued she laughing  I verily believe he is a man of quality  "Do you know him then" said miss Courteney who could not help smiling a little at her vivacity  I only judge by his appearance and manners  replied Mrs Eccles  that he is a man of rank but I dare say we shall hear more from him  "Sure Mrs Eccles" interrupted miss Courteney with some emotion  "Nay nay child" exclaimed Mrs Eccles  don't put yourself into a flurry I don't know that I shall ever see him again But pray what book have you got here  One I found in your parlour  said miss Courteney "Oh I see what it is" cried Mrs Eccles opening it  it is a charming pretty book If you love reading miss I can furnish you with books I have a very pretty collection I should be glad to see your collection  said the young lady who was apprehensive of her renewing a conversation that had been very disagreeable to her  Mrs Eccles immediately led her into a little room on the same floor and opening a closet in which there were about two dozen books ranged on a shelf she bid her take her choice for there was variety enough  Henrietta soon examined the so much boasted collection which she found chiefly consisted of novels and plays "Well" said Mrs Eccles  how do you like my books are they not prettily chosen  "I assure you" replied she taking down one  you chose very well when you chose this for it is one of the most exquisite pieces of humour in our language  I knew you would approve of my taste  said Mrs Eccles  but what have you got O the Adventures of Joseph Andrews Yes that is a very pretty book to be sure but there is Mrs Haywood's Novels did you ever read them Oh they are the finest lovesick passionate stories I assure you you'll like them vastly pray take a volume of Haywood upon my recommendation  "Excuse me" said Henrietta  I am very well satisfied with what I have I have read this book three times already and yet I assure you I shall begin it again with as much eagerness and delight as I did at first  "Well as you please" said Mrs Eccles leaving her at the door of her own chamber  I won't disturb you till dinner is ready  Miss Courteney sat down to her book which agreeably engaged her attention till she was interrupted with the pleasing news of her porter's being returned she flew down stairs he delivered her a letter the seal of which she eagerly broke and found it as follows  CELINDA to her dearest CLELIA  NO words can describe the excess of my grief at the news of your disappointment but my dear how was it possible for your chairmen to mistake the house so egregiously not know where Mrs Egret lived Foolish fellows she is one of the greatest milleners in town and employed by persons of the first rank But don't be uneasy I shall see you this afternoon your messenger found me preparing to set out for town with my aunt Adieu my Clelia and believe me with the most unparallel'd affection ever your's  CELINDA  The hopes of seeing her friend and being settled in more agreeable lodgings gave Henrietta  such a flow of spirits that when she was summoned to dinner by her landlady she appeared less reserved than usual and even kept up the conversation with some kind of chearfulness Mrs Eccles finding her in so good a humour introduced the subject which ran most in her headThe fine young gentleman who had been her customer in the morning was praised in raptures of admiration so genteel so well bred such sparkling eyes such an air of distinction Every now and then exclaiming  Well you have certainly made a conquest of him we shall see him again never fear he'll find his way here again I warrant him  Miss Courteney to put an end to this discourse told her landlady that she expected a lady to drink tea with her that afternoon Mrs Eccles immediately gave orders for the diningroom to be put in order and thither miss Courteney retired in expectation of her visiter At six o'clock a footman's rap at the door anounced the arrival of miss Woodby Henrietta ran to the head of the stairs to receive her  "O Heavens my dear creature" cried miss Woodby  What trouble have I been in upon your account but even the disquiets of friendship are pleasing I would not be insensible  of that charming passion nor without an object of it for the world  Miss Courteney thanked her in very obliging terms while her sentimental friend adjusted her dress in the glass and then throwing herself into a chair declared that she was all impatience to hear her history  "Permit me" said miss Courteney  to inform you first that I am not easy here I do not greatly like my landlady and I wish I could remove this very night  Miss Woodby told her it was impossible because she had not yet seen Mrs Egret but that she would go to her in the morning and prepare her for her coming Henrietta being now at ease complied with her friend's request and began her little history in this manner  CHAP VII  In which Henrietta relates the story of her parents introductory to her own  IT is no wonder my dear miss Woodby that at these early years I am precipitated into distresses and dangers my very birth was a misfortune to my parents and intailed upon them those miseries which began by their unhappy passion  My father was the youngest of three brothers but so great a favourite of his father the earl of that it was thought he would make his fortune very considerable having a very large estate and a very lucrative employment out of which he every year laid by large sums to provide for his younger sons of whom my father as I have already said was the best beloved  It happened one day that the widow of an officer in the army came to solicit the earl's interest towards getting her a pension She was accompanied by her daughter a young woman about sixteen years of age and who must at that time have been exquisitely handsome since after a long series of troubles  and in an age more advanced she appeared to me one of the most beautiful women in the world  The widow by a certain method of persuasion which operates powerfully on the domesticks of men in place got her petition sent up to the earl It imported that her husband after having served near fifty years in the army had obtained leave to sell his commission for the benefit of his wife and child that the money arising from it had been deposited in the hands of an agent who had broke a few months afterwards by which unhappy accident all the money was lost and this loss had so greatly affected the old gentleman that he died a few weeks afterwards leaving his wife and child wholly unprovided for and made wretched by those very means that were calculated to secure them a genteel subsistence since by the sale of her husband's commission the widow was no longer intitled to a pension which however she hoped to obtain in consideration of his long services and the peculiar circumstances of her misfortune  The widow who knew it was in this nobleman's power to put her immediately upon the list of pensions conceived great hopes of  the success of her application when after waiting two hours in the hall she was ordered to atttend his lordship in his library  The nobleman received her with civility enough but his first words destroyed those expectations with which she had flattered herself  I am sorry it is not in my power to do you any service said he your husband sold out therefore you have no right to the pension I pity your misfortune but in this case there is nothing to be done  The widow was a woman of sense and breeding she was sensible that the earl paid no regard to her plea otherwise he would not have urged that as an argument against granting her petition without which no petition would have been necessary intreaties she found would be fruitless therefore she would not descend to the meanness of a suppliant but curtsy'd in silent anguish and withdrew  My father who was present at this scene and who had beheld the decent sorrow of the mother with reverence the innocent beauty of the daughter with tender admiration impelled by an emotion which yet he knew not  the cause of hastily followed them and offered his hand to the widow to lead her down stairs  She who from a natural dignity of sentiment had been enabled to endure the supercilious behaviour of the father without betraying any signs of discomposure burst into tears at this instance of unexpected attention and respect in the son  Mr Courteney as he led her down stairs had his eyes incessantly turned towards the young lady who followed blushing to see herself so earnestly beheld He found they had not a coach waiting for them he ordered a servant to call one and in the mean time desired they would walk into a parlour where he took occasion to express his concern to the widow for the disappointment she had met with but assured her that he would employ his good offices in her favour and from the influence he had over his father hoped he should succeed He then desired to know where he might wait upon her in case he had any good news to bring her  The widow charmed with his politeness astonished at his kindness and full of hope and pleasing expectation gave him a direction in writing which she had brought with her  Mr Courteney received it bowing low as if she had conferred a favour on him a favour it was indeed for by this time he was lost in love for the charming daughter whose looks discovered such soft sensibility of her situation such conscious dignity which misfortune could not impair such calm resignation as if superior to her woes that her beauty seemed her least perfection and he was more captivated by the graces of her mind that shone out in her person than with her lovely person itself  The coach was now come he sighed when he took leave of them rivetting his eyes on the young charmer who modestly looked down unable to bear his ardent glances Again be assured the widow of his services and suddenly recollecting himself he put a purse into her hand begging her to accept that trifle as an earnest of his friendship  The lady was so much surprised at his behaviour that she was at a loss in what manner to answer him and before she could form any she found herself in the coach to which he had accompanied her with great respect When the coach drove from the door she examined the contents of the purse and found five and twenty guineas in it a present which if it  had been less would have mortified her pride and being so considerable alarmed her prudence She recollected every circumstance of the young gentleman's behaviour and all contributed to persuade her that he was actuated by some motive more forcible than mere compassion  She remembered that she had caught him gazing earnestly at her daughter she reproached herself for taking her with her for accepting the money for giving a direction She dreaded the consequence of having exposed her child to the attempts of a young man formed to please and by his rank and fortune enabled to pursue every method that could gratify his passions She began now to be solicitous about the effect such uncommon generosity had on the mind of her daughter She asked her what she thought of the gentleman who so kindly interested himself in their affairs notwithstanding the cruel denial his father had given  Miss whose gratitude had with difficulty been restrained from rising from her heart to her tongue eagerly seized this opportunity to praise their benefactor Her expressions were so lively she showed so tender a sensibility of his kindness such a blushing approbation  of his person and manners that the good widow thought proper to check her vivacity by a little reproof and attributed all the respect he had shown them to his natural politeness and his offers of service and the present he had forced on her to a sudden sally of compassion which young unexperienced persons are liable to However her apprehensions were now increased and when Mr Courteney came to see her in consequence of his promise which was two days after wards she had already taken her resolution  She took care that her daughter should not be in the way when he sent up his name and notwithstanding the politeness with which he accosted her she observed that he was disappointed and that his eyes involuntarily sought out an object which he more wished to see than her  I don't know whether these little particulars may not seem tedious to you my dear miss Woodby but I have often heard my mother repeat them with delight declaring that these first tokens of my father's affection for her made so deep an impression on her heart fluctuating as it then was between hope and fear that she ever retained the most lively remembrance of them and could never  relate them without feeling in some degree the same pleasing emotions with which she was at that time agitated  Mr Courteney began the conversation with assuring the widow that he had been mindful of her affairs that his solicitations had not yet indeed had the desired effect but that he hoped shortly to bring her better news The widow thanked him with great politeness for his kind interposition in her favour which she declared would always have a claim to her sincerest gratitude whether he succeeded or not in his applications She then drew the purse out of her pocket and putting it respectfully into his hands told him that not being in any immediate necessity she begged he would not take it ill if she declined accepting a present which would lay her under an unreturnable obligation  Mr Courteney blushed with surprize and disappoimment but the dignity with which she looked and spoke making it impossible for him to press her any farther he received the money back again with a low bow apologizing at the same time for the liberty he had taken  The widow seeing him disconcerted politely recommended her interests to him and  Mr Courteney charmed that she would allow him to be her friend on any terms retired with a promise that he would take as much care of them as of his own  "This interview" continued Henrietta  confirmed the widow in her suspicions that her daughter was not indifferent to their new benefactor He had observed her scrupulous reserve with regard to the young beauty and hoped to remove it by affecting a total neglect of her so that he did not even enquire how she did Whatever is done with design is always overdone the widow was persuaded that a man of Mr Courteney's good breeding would not have passed over one of the common forms of politeness but to answer some secret purpose Her vigilance increased in proportion to her fears and although he made her several visits under pretence of enquiring more minutely into the circumstances of her case yet he never was so fortunate as to find her daughter with her  This conduct while it stimulated his passion gave him a high opinion of the virtue and prudence of her who in such unhappy circumstances showed such extreme attention to the honour and reputation of her child Hitherto he had not been at the trouble to  examine his own views and designs upon this young beauty Hurried away by the violence of his passion he had assiduously sought opportunities of seeing and conversing with her but the difficulties he met with made him look into his own heart that he might know if he was still sufficient master of it to give over a pursuit which was likely to prove fruitless  Amazed to find that what he took for a transient inclination was a passion immoveably fixed that he had formed resolutions when he believed he had only entertained desires that the whole happiness and misery of his life was in the power of a young woman destitute of friends fortune hopes and expectations and rich only in beauty and virtue for virtuous he was sure she must be under the care of so wise and prudent a mother He was alarmed at his own condition dreaded the consequences of a passion so placed as that it could never procure the sanction of his father's consent and resolved never more to expose himself to the danger of seeing her  However he did not fail to solicit his father very earnestly in behalf of the unfortunate widow The carl who had taken notice of his officious respect the day she was introduced to him and attributed it rather to the beauty  of the daughter than any sentiment of compassion began to be uneasy at his so frequently pressing him on that subject and forbad him to mention it any more  Mr Courteney was obliged to be silent lest he should confirm those suspicions which he saw his father had conceived and finding his mind in a very uneasy state he hoped that by removing himself to a greater distance from the object he loved he should remove the thoughts of her likewise he obtained his father's content to his retiring for a few weeks to their seat in the country under pretence of a slight indisposition but he could not resolve to go without endeavouring once more to force a present upon the widow which might prevent her being exposed to any distress during his absence  He therefore wrote to her and acquainting her with the ill success of his mediation with his father expressed the highest concern for it and assured her that nothing could alleviate it but her acceptance of the bank note which he inclosed and which was for fifty pounds he told her he was going into the country that she might not suppose he had any design of inducing her by such a present  to admit his visits and concluded with assuring her that she might at all times command his services and rely on his friendship  He did not send away this letter till he was ready to take horse and being now more composed from the belief that he had silenced the scruples of this good woman and secured her and her lovely daughter from any immediate necessity he pursued his journey full of pleasing reflections on the disinterestedness of his love  CHAP VIII  In which Henrietta continues her history  ABSENCE says a certain writer increases violent passions and cures moderate ones just as the wind extinguishes a small flame while it makes a great one burn more fiercely Mr Courteney's passion was of this kind he had loved with violence from the moment he began to love In vain he had recourse to books to company to field sports and rural amusements it was not possible for him to call off his thoughts a moment from that object from whom he fled with such  care Two months he wore away in a constant perturbation of mind still flattering himself that he was nearer his cure while his disease gathered strength every day  It happened that one evening he fell into company with some officers whose regiment was quartered in that part of the country and one of them mentioned colonel Carlton and the unhappy situation his widow and daughter were left in  Mr Courteney rouzed to attention by that name so dear to him pretended to be wholly ignorant of those ladies case that be might indulge himself in the pleasure of talking  her he loved  The officer gave him a circumstantial detail of what he knew as well as himself concluding with many commendations of Mrs Carlton's good sense prudence and virtue and such rapturous praises of the young lady's beauty and uncommon qualifications at such early years that Mr Courteney for the first time sensible of the tortures of jealousy could with difficulty conceal his emotions  You speak so feelingly said a gentleman i  company of this young lady's perfections that I fancy you are in love with her come he  is her health is it to be a match▪  I should be but too happy in such a wife replied the officer but she deserves a better husband it is not for a poor lieutenant added he smiling to marry for love but if I was a man of fortune I would prefer miss Carlton to all the women I have ever seen  Mr Courteney afterwards declared that he suffered inconceivable anguish during this conversation He quitted the company with some precipitation and when he was at liberty to reflect he reproached himself a thousand times for his folly in leaving such a treasure for another to obtain Every man he thought would look upon miss Carlton with the same eyes as that young officer and among them might not one be found blest with a fortune to make her happy and above all narrow considerations which could hinder him from making himself so  Resolutions are easily formed when the heart suggests them Mr Courteney who had so long fluctuated between his passion and his prudence was by the fear of losing what he loved determined in an instant to put it past the possibility of losing her His father's anger which at first appeared so formidable to him was now considered as a trifle that would be easily got over he was not going  to introduce any stale mistress into a noble family nor to give a comedian or singer for a sister to his sisters and a daughter to his mother alliances so much in fashion with the present race of nobility and people of fortune in miss Carlton he should marry birth beauty virtue every perfection but riches but unhappily that in the estimation of his father was worth them all  His fortune indeed was undetermined it might be great it might be very inconsiderable since it depended upon the will of his father His father would never consent to his marriage with miss Carlton but though disobliged yet loving him as he did was it likely that he would always continue inexorable Besides he had a certain though a remote prospect of a good estate to which he was to succeed at the death of a relation who was old and had been married twenty years without having ever had a child  Should he find it impossible to reconcile his father to his marriage yet he was secure at least of a genteel provision but with such excellencies as miss Carlton was possessed of how could it be imagined that she should not in time conciliate his father's affections and make him approve of his choice  There is no logick my dear miss Woodby like the logick of the heart Mr Courteney as is usual on such occasions having taken his resolution before he reasoned upon the matter reasoned afterwards in such a manner as to be soon persuaded his resolution was right  Early the next morning he ordered his horses to be made ready and he returned to London with all imaginable expedition He alighted at the house of a friend where he dismissed his servants and horses and then taking a hackney coach was driven to the street in which Mrs Carlton lived Upon stopping at the house and enquiring for Mrs Carlton he was told that she had left it five weeks ago and being greatly indisposed had taken lodgings at Chelsea for the air  Mr Courteney who now thought every moment an age till he saw miss Carlton and acquainted her with his passion and his honourable intentions procured as full a direction as could be given him but notwithstanding his impatience to be with his mistress he obeyed the dictates of his duty in first going home to pay his respects to his father  The earl received him a little coldly an expression of displeasure was on his countenance which however wore off by degrees as he enquired concerning his health his studies and amusements during his absence At length seeming to recollect something he went to his cabinet took out a letter the seal of which had been broke and delivered it into his son's hand assuming the same angry countenance as before  Mr Courteney not able to imagine what all this meant opened the letter hastily and found it was from Mrs Carlton dated the very day of his departure and in it was inclosed the bank note he had sent the purpo  of her letter was to refuse in a genteel but steady manner all pecuniary assistance from him however she thanked him for his  ilities and acknowledged herself greatly obliged to him  When Mr Courteney had read this letter which he did with much confusion the ear  asked him sternly what was his design by engaging in such a commerce You are in love with the daughter added he no doubt but if you corrupt her you are not an honest man if you marry her you are no longer my son  He left him as he pronounced these words and Mr Courteney who while he beheld it at a distance thought his father's displeasure might be borne with was overwhelmed with the first effects of it and relapsed into all his former doubts anxiety and irresolution  He retired to his own chamber to consider on what he ought to do but unable to bear the cruel war which such contrary interests such opposite wishes such perplexed designs raised in his mind he hurried out of the house to lose reflection in a variety of objects and took his way to the Park  He walked down the Mall it was crouded with company which did not in the least engage his attention he continued his walk and finding himself at Buckinghamgate his steps mechanically pursued the road that led to Chelsea  As soon as he saw himself near the place where his mistress resided all other thoughts were absorbed in the transporting reflection that he should see her within a few moments his father's threats were forgot the loss of his savour filled him with no uneasy apprehensions To how many revolutions is the human mind subject when passion has assumed the reins of government which reason ought  to hold Mr Courteney had almost imperceptibly to himself resumed his first design of offering his hand to miss Carlton  With very little difficulty he found out the house where her mother and she lodged the door was opened to him by a girl who upon his enquiring if Mrs Carlton was at home told him she was sick in bed and showing him into a little parlour ran up stairs to acquaint miss as he supposed that a gentleman was there  In a few minutes a venerable old woman appeared who had so fixed a concern upon her countenance that Mr Courteney shifting his thoughts from the illness of the mother to the apprehension of some possible misfortune to the daughter for love if it hopes all fears all likewise asked her with great emotion if any thing extraordinary had happened to the ladies  The good woman pleased with his solicitude which she thought promised some relief told him plainly that Mrs Carlton was in the utmost distress that she had been ill several weeks that she had not been able to procure proper advice and added she bursting into tears she has even wanted common necessaries  O my God exclaimed Mr Courteney with a deep sigh but misswhat is become of miss Alas sir replied the old woman the dear child is almost dead with fatigue and grief she has watched by her mother these ten nights successively there is no persuading her to quit her for a moment I left her in an agony of sorrow for it is believed poor Mrs Carlton cannot live three days  Conduct me to her cried Mr Courteney eagerly I may possibly be able to comfort her let me see her I conjure you immediately  Stay a moment sir said the old woman stopping him for he was making towards the door I will go up first and inform the ladies There is no occasion for that said Mr Courteney Mrs Carlton knows me very well she will not I am sure be sorry to see me I have something to say to her  The good woman seeing his obstinacy permitted him to follow her up stairs she gently opened the chamberdoor and approaching the bed where the sick lady lay told her there was a friend of her's who desired to see her Mr Courteney entered that moment and beheld a sight which called for  more fortitude than he was at that time posessed of to support without tears  Mrs Carlton lay extended on her bed supported by a heighth of cushions to facilitate her breathing which she seemed to do with great difficulty Death appeared in her languid countenance and an expression of the tender anguish of a mother for the child whom she was so soon to leave exposed to the insults of a barbarous world mixed with the pious resignation of a christian was impressed in every line of it  Her daughter was kneeling at the bedside and held one of her mother's hands which she was bending over in an agony of grief upon hearing what the old woman said she raised her head and directing her streaming eyes to the place where Mr Courteney stood showed him a face pale emaciated but lovely still at sight of him a faint blush overspread her cheeks It is Mr Courteney my dear mamma said she  Oh sir said Mrs Carlton perceiving him you are very good to seek out affliction thus I shall shortly be past all my cares but what will become of this poor helpless orphan The tears that streamed from her eyes prevented her further utterance  Mr Courteney threw himself on his knees at the bedside and almost sobbing with the violence of his emotions at this affecting language Oh madam said he What must you not have suffered why would you not accept what little assistance it was in my power to offer you I know your delicate scruples I come to beg you will give yourself a right to all my future services I have something to communicate to you But added he looking at the old woman who had introduced him we are not alone  Speak freely sir said Mrs Carlton this good woman is my daughter's nurse she knows all my affairs I am much indebted to her kindness and affection for my child  What I have to say proceeded Mr Courteney relates to that dear that lovely daughter I loved her from the first moment I saw her such innocence such beauty could not suggest any impure desire As soon as I knew the force of my passion which absence first made me know I fixed its purpose Permit me to offer her my hand I cannot be happy without her  What do you say sir said Mrs Carlton excessively surprised would you marry my daughter But after a little pause No pursued  she this can never be your father will not consent to it  I own freely to you madam said Mr Courteney that I have no hopes of gaining my father's consent but when the affai  i  irretrievable he will be softened I am sure he will Let not this scruple hinder you from giving your daughter a protector Surely said Mrs Carlton lifting up her eyes the hand of Providence is here and it would be impious to oppose its will You have my consent sir said she to Mr Courteney would it pleased God that you had his also whom it is your duty to consult on this occasion and to obey if you can  Mr Courteney assured her he would solicit his father's consent but that he could not be happy without miss Carlton and was already determined  That young lady had retired into another room at the beginning of this discourse in perturbations which may be better imagined than described Mr Courteney by her mother's permission attended her he approached her with a timidity which the inequality of their circumstances considered may seem surprising but those who know the nature of a sincere and violent passion will easily account  for it For fear says an elegant writer always accompanies love when it is great as flames burn highest when they tremble most He took her hand and kissing it respectfully told her that Mrs Carlton had begun his felicity by permitting him to offer himself to her acceptance as a husband but that she only could complete it by her consent  Miss Carlton blushed turned pale and blushed again at length she replied that she had no other will than her mother's But this offer added she in an accent that expressed at once her surprise and gratitude is so generous so unexpected so unhoped for The last words seemed to escape her she blushed more than before Mr Courteney took in all their tender meaning he kissed her hand again in a rapture of joy and was beginning to make her some passionate declarations when they heard the nurse crying out for help  Surprise and joy at what had so lately happened operated so powerfully on Mrs Carlton's almost exhausted spirits that she had fallen into a fainting fit Miss Carlton eagerly flew to her assistance Mr Courteney followed her with an anxious concern As soon as she recovered he told her he would instantly return  to London and dispatch a physician to attend her and would be with her again the next evening  He took a tender farewel of his mistre  and calling the nurse aside gave her twenty guineas to provide whatever was wanting and hastened back to London  CHAP IX  The story continued  MR Courteney's first care was to send a physician to the sick lady and that performed he deliberated in what manner he should acquaint his father with his intention He knew him too well to hope for his consent to his marriage with miss Ca  n and he had not courage enough to stand the reproaches of a parent whom he was predetermined to disobey He chose therefore o  write to him supposing he should when unawed by his presence be able to find arguments strong enough to make some impression on his mind and to plead his excuse  As he dreaded extremely a private interview with his father he was glad to find at  his return home that a great deal of company was expected that evening he did not appear till they were all met having purposely wasted a good deal of time in dressing The earl was still ruffled with what had passed before between him and his son and Mr Courteney observed that his looks and behaviour were less kind than usual  As soon as he retired to his apartment instead of going to bed he sat down to compose a letter to his father He began with the highest expressions of grief for having by an irresistable impulse engaged his affections without his concurrence he justified his choice by every argument that love could suggest in favour of the beloved object he implored the continuance of his father's affection and promised in every future action the most perfect submission and obedience  This difficult task performed he found his mind much easier and composed as if in reality he had obtained the pardon he had solicited and now resigned himself to all the pleasing reveries of successful love  After a few hours rest he rose under pretence of going out to ride and leaving orders with a servant to deliver his letter to  his father at his hour of dressing he went immediately to the Commons procured a licence and flew to Chelsea he found Mrs Carlton much worse than when he left her yet joy at seeing him again seemed to give her new life and spirits She called him to he  bedside he acquainted her with what he had done she had some scruples but the fear of leaving her daughter destitute overbalanced them all  I am dying said she pressing his hand the physician you sent was too sincere to flatter me I die contented since I leave my child under your protection Let the ceremony be performed in my presence after that is over I shall have no farther business with the world Miss Carlton drowned in tears and almost sinking under the violence of her grief was with difficulty persuaded to give her hand to her lover at so shocking a time but her dying mother conjured her to give her that last satisfaction A clergyman was instantly provided by the faithful nurse the clerk acted as father to the weeping bride and Mr Courteney's servant and the good nurse were witnesses Never sure was there a more melancholy wedding the  bridegroom's joy was checked by simpathising concernthe bride's tender sensibility lost in agonising woethe service was performed with the solemn sadness of a funeral  As soon as it was over Mrs Carlton collected all her remaining strength and spirits to pronounce a blessing on the newwedded pair and straining her daughter with a weak embrace declared that she was now easy and should die in peace Mr Courteney made a genteel present to the clergyman and the clerk and dismissed them he took an affectionate leave of Mrs Carlton who desired to be left to her private devotions and earnestly recommending his bride to the care of her nurse he went back to town with a resolution to declare his marriage to his father his sentiments being too delicate and his notions of honour too just to permit him on any consideration of interest to conceal the engagements he had entered into and suffer the woman whom he thought worthy to be his wife to live under a doubtful character  On his return home he found his letter had been delivered to the earl His mother being informed of his arrival sent for him to her dressingroom where he found her in tears She told him that his father had been in the  most violent transports of anger upon receiving his letter and she conjured him  he valued her peace to proceed no farther in a design that must inevitably be his ruin  Mr Courteney sighed and was preparing to answer her when the earl himself entered the room the impression of his first  was still visible on his countenance As soon  he saw his son he poured a torrent of reproaches on him inveighing against his meanness and ingratitude then suddenly and with great vehemence uttered the most dreadful imprecations on him if he followed the dictates of his despicablyplaced passion and married a beggar  Oh hold my lord cried Mr Courteney throwing himself at his feet curse  e not for I am already married The  ost mad with rage at this confession spurned him rudely with his foot and flung out of the room declaring that he renounced him for ever  Mr Courteney slung with indignation at this treatment rose up and uttered some words of resentment when his attention was called off from the affront he had suffered by the condition in which he observed his mother who from surprise and terror had swooned  and lay motionless on the couch where she had thrown herself Mr Courteney excessively shocked at this sight rung the bell for her woman while he applied himself to give her all the assistance he was able As soon as he saw her recovering he staid not to increase her disorder by his presence but retired to his apartment and after he had taken all the money he had in his cabinet he left that house that was now become dreadful to him and went to the lodgings of a young gentleman who had been his fellowstudent at college and whom he had reason to believe his friend if friendship can be acquired by confering obligations  To this young gentleman he unloaded his heart but found not the consolation he expected He expressed the utmost astonishment and concern for his indiscreet marriage and instead of offering him any advice in his perplexed situation or consoling him oppressed as he was by the displeasure of his father manifested in so contemptuous a manner he maintained that the earl's anger was just and reasonable and exclaimed at his imprudence in ruining himself for a woman  Before the mischief was done remonstrances might have been seasonable but nothing  could be more unkind than to insist upon an error which was already committed and could not be repaired Mr Courteney was at first surprised at this behaviour in a man who had always shewn so deep a sense of his kindness and professed the most tender friendship for him but he had still temper enough left to consider that most people follow their own interests and are at one time grateful for their convenience and at another ungrateful for the same reason  He left him without taking any notice of the disgust he had conceived and after he had hired lodgings for the reception of his wife he hastened to Chelsea where he arrived time enough to moderate the first agonies of her grief for the loss of her mother who had expired a few moments before  Having given directions concerning the funeral he forced Mrs Courteney out of that mournful house and carried her to London applying himself with the tenderest assiduity to alleviate the sense of her loss all his own just causes of uneasiness being forgot and his anxiety for the melancholy future lost in his contemplation of the happy present so true it is that weddedlove supplies the want of every other blessing in life and as no condition  can be truly happy without it so none can be absolutely miserable with it  CHAP X  A farther continuation of her story  IN the mean time Mr Courteney corresponded privately with his mother whose gentle nature had with little difficulty been softened into a forgiveness of her son's imprudent marriage but all her endeavours to reconcile the earl to it had proved ineffectual He continued inexorable and peremptorily commanded her never to mention that undutiful son to him more whom he reprobated for ever  The countess durst not hazard an interview with her son while his father's resentment continued unappeased but she allowed him two hundred a year out of her pinmoney and upon this moderate income they lived with more happiness than is often to be found in the highest affluence    "And why not" interrupted miss Woodby here  a cottage with the person we love is  to be prefered to a palace with one to whom  interest and not affection has joined us I know I could be contented to keep sh  with the man I loved Speak truth my d  Clelia would you not like to be a shop  ess O what a delightful employ  watch a few harmless sheep to wa  groves and fields or lie reclined upon the flowery margin of some murmuring  and listen to the plaintive voice of the nightingale or the tender faithful vows of some lovely and beloved shepherd  "What a romantic picture" said mi  Courteney laughing  have you drawn It is a mighty pretty one it must be confessed but it is not at all like I remember when I was about fourteen I had the same notions of shepherds and shepherdesses but I was soon cured I happened to be at the house of a country gentleman who managed a large farm of his own one of the servants saying something about the shepherd my heart danced at the sound My imagination represented to me such a pretty figure as we see on the stage in the dramatic pastoral entertainment of Damon and Phillida in a fine green habit all bedizened with ribbons a neat crook and a garland of flowers I begged to be permitted to go into the fields to  see the shepherd and eagerly enquired if there were no shepherdesses likewise but how was I disappointedThe shepherd was an old man in a ragged waistcoat and so miserably sunburnt that he might have been taken for a mulatto the shepherdess looked like a witch she was sitting under a hedge mending old stockings with a straw hive on her head and a tatter'd garment on of as many colours as there were patches in it How diverting it would have been to have heard this enamour'd swain sigh out soft things to this lovely nymph  "Oh ridiculous" cried miss Woodby  I am sick at the very thought but my dear Clelia go on I beseech you with your story  "I have not come to my own story yet" said miss Courteney  all that you have heard has been only an introduction to it and I have given you the history of my parents in the words as near as I can remember of my mother for she loved scribbling and committed the principal incidents of her life to paper which for my instruction she permitted me to read I say instruction for she was a woman of fine understanding and deep thinking and she had interspersed through  her little narrative many beautiful and just reflections and many observations and useful maxims which her reading which was very comprehensive and her experience furnished her with  "Proceed my dear Clelia" said miss Woodby observing Henrietta paused here  I am impatient to hear more  "If you please" said miss Courteney "we will drink tea first"  I have just two hours and a half to stay with you  replied miss Woodby looking at her "watch  if I am at home by nine o'clock which is my aunt's hour for supper it will do  Henrietta then ordered tea which was soon dispatched and she resumed her story in this manner  My father who was very desirous of conciliating at least his elder brother's affections wrote to him he being now upon his travels and gave him an account of his marriage but his letter though conceived in the most tender and respectful terms produced a cruel and supercilious answer which not only took away all hope of his proving a mediator between him and his father but convinced him that he had in him no longer a friend or brother  His affairs were in this desperate situation when my mother became pregnant a distant relation of my father's now took an interest in this event and being very rich and ambitious of making a family he declared that if the child was a son he would adopt him and make him his heir You may imagine this design was received with great joy the old gentleman was very assiduous in his visits to my mother during her pregnancy and seemed extremely happy in the thoughts of perpetuating his name an ambition very common to persons of low extraction who by industry and thrift have risen to great riches for he was only by marriage a relation to my father and had been too much neglected on account of the meanness of his original But all these flattering expectations were destroyed by my birth which I had reason to say proved a misfortune to my parents The capricious old man was so greatly chagrined at his disappointment that he transferred all his favours to another cousin who was so lucky as to present him with a son to succeed to his fortune and continue his obscure name to posterity  My brother's birth happened a year afterwards and unfortunately for him a year too  late My father still continued to draw his whole income from the bounty of his mother who was a constant but fruitless mediator in his behalf her death which happened about three years after his marriage was an irreparable loss to him for it was not improbable but the lenient hand of time which weakens the force of every passion joined to her tender solicitations might have effected a reconciliation between his father and him but this hope was now no more the countess bequeathed my father all the money she had saved which was but a very small sum for she had always given with a liberal hand to the poor though with so little ostentation that it was supposed she had saved some thousands out of her pinmoney for she was less expensive than any other woman of her rank in England but it was not till after my father's marriage that she began to save and then only for him  Six hundred pounds was all that was found in her cabinet which some months after her decease was paid to my father with every circumstance of contempt  These repeated calamities were so far from lessening the love of my father and mother that they seemed to redouble their tenderness  seeking in each other that happiness which fortune denied them and which they were always sure to find in their own virtue and mutual affection  My father who had had a very liberal education employed the greatest part of his time in the instruction of his children under his tuition I acquired the French and Italian languages by my mother I was taught every useful accomplishment for a young woman in my situation nor did my father's narrow circumstances hinder him from procuring me those which were suitable to my birth My brother had no other tutor but this excellent father who qualified him for a university and at fourteen years of age he was sent to that of Leyden and I have never seen him since  In the mean time the earl my grandfather who still continued inexorable was taken off suddenly by an apoplectick fit and having never altered his will which he made immediately after the marriage of my father he found he was cut off with a shilling This stroke as it was always expected was less sensibly felt than another which immediately followed it That relation to whose estate my father was to succeed having buried his wife married a young woman who in a year  afterwards brought him a son to inherit his fortune  My father now seeing no prospect of any provision for his children fell into a deep melancholy he had by the interest of some of his friends obtained a place which brought him in between three and four hundred a year but out of this it was impossible to save much The uneasiness of mind which he laboured under corrupted his blood he was seized with a decay which carried him off in a few months and deprived his wife of the best husband his children of the best father that ever was  In his last illness he had wrote to his brother and recommended his helpless family to his compassion but that nobleman whose avarice was his strongest passion and whose resentment against his brother was kept up by the arts of his wife her family though noble being very poor and therefore dependent upon him took no other notice of my father's last request than to send my mother a bank bill for an hundred pounds declaring at the same time that it was all the assistance she must ever expect from him and with this heroick act of generosity he silenced  the soft pleadings of nature and persuaded himself that he had done his duty  My mother being young with child when my father died miscarried and by that accident together with her continual grief she fell into a languishing illness which threatened a short period to her days Five hundred pounds was all that my father left from this small sum a widow and two children were to draw their future subsistence What a melancholy prospect However my brother who was then about seventeen had made such great proficiency in learning that notwithstanding his youth he was recommended by the professors of the university to have the care of some English youths who studied there which afforded him a decent subsistence  My mother having placed four hundred and fifty pounds in the hands of a rich merchant who had been a friend of my father's and gave her very good interest for it she disposed of all her furniture and with the money arising from the sale set out with me for Bath the waters being prescribed to her by her physician  Not being able to support the expence of living in the town she took lodgings in a pleasant village about three miles distemper from it and here feeling her distemper daily gaining  ground she prepared for death with a resignation that was only interrupted by her anxiety for me  It was not indeed easy to form any plan for my future subsistence which would not subject me to a situation very unfit for my birth Had my brother been provided for she would have made no scruple of sinking that small sum that was left into an annuity for my life which with economy might support me above necessity and dependence She wrote to my brother and desired his advice with regard to me My brother as if he had entered into her views in his answer conjured her to have no solicitude about him since with the education he had received he could not fail of supporting himself in the character of a gentleman but to dispose of that money in any manner which might be most for my advantage  My mother shed tears of tender satisfaction over this letter so full of duty to her and affection for me but the more generous and disinterested her son showed himself the less was she capable of taking a resolution which if any disappointment happened to him must leave him without any resource  You may be sure my dear miss Woodby I was not very forward to fix her purpose for I could not bear the thought of being the only person in our little distressed family to whom a subsistence was secured While my mother was thus fluctuating she was visited in her retirement by lady Manning a widow lady of a very plentiful fortune with whom she had been in some degree of intimacy during the life of my father  This lady showed great fondness for me and my mother imparting to her her difficulties with regard to settling me lady Manning begged her to make herself quite easy for that she would take me under her own care  Miss Courteney said she will do me honour by accepting my house for an asylum and I and my daughter will think ourselves happy in such an agreeable companion My mother was extremely pleased with this offer and lady Manning pressed me to go with her to London for which place she was to set out in a few days  I was so much shocked at the proposal of leaving my mother in the dangerous condition she was judged to be that I did not receive lady Manning's offer with that sense of her intended kindness which she doubtless expected  and when my mother wholly governed by the consideration of my interest urged me to go with lady Manning I burst into a violent passion of tears vehemently protesting that I would never leave her and lamenting her causeless distrust of my affection in supposing that I could be prevailed upon by any prospect of advantage to myself to separate from her  I observed lady Manning redened at these words which she understood as a reproach for her making so improper a proposal and which I really desired she should for I was highly disgusted with her want of delicacy in desiring me to leave my mother and her believing it possible that I could consent  I saw pleasure in my mother's eyes at this artless expression of my tenderness for her but at the same time I thought I could perceive by the turn of her countenance that she was apprehensive I had disobliged lady Manning therefore I endeavoured to remove her fears by the strongest assurances of gratitude to that lady She received those assurances with a little superciliousness at first but that presently wore off and at parting she renewed her professions of friendship to my mother and promises of a parent's care of me  She left Bath three days afterwards so that we did not see her again which made my mother a little uneasy but we had soon a very kind letter from her in which she repeated all her former offers and expressed great tenderness for me  At her return from London she passed through Bath in her way to her countryseat and finding my mother much worse she redoubled her professions of affection for me and was so lavish in her promises that she left her quite easy on my account Indeed notwithstanding what I have suffered from lady Manning I shall ever think myself obliged to her for contributing so greatly towards that composure of mind which my mother felt from the time that she thought me secure of an asylum till it would suit with my brother's circumstances to take me under his own care  I will not my dear miss Woodby enlarge upon the last three months of my mother's life which was spent in a constant preparation for her end Indeed the innocence of her manners and the unfeigned piety that shone through her conduct made her whole life one continued preparation for that awful moment so dreadful to the wicked so full of peace confidence and holy joy to the good In fine I  lost this excellent mother and my bleeding heart still feels her loss  The tears which at this tender remembrance ran from miss Courteney's eyes made a pathetick pause in her relation but recovering herself she proceeded as will be found in the following Book  HENRIETTA BOOK THE SECOND  CHAP I  In which Henrietta enters upon her own story and shews that to confer benefits is not always a proof of benevolence  "THE worthy merchant" resumed miss Courteney  whom I mentioned to you had the goodness to come to Bath upon the news of my mother's extreme danger He arrived time enough to receive her last intreaties that he would continue his friendship to me I was then entered into my twentieth year and chose him for my guardian he would have taken me with him to his house but my promise being engaged to lady Manning I was obliged to decline his obliging offer  I wrote her an account of my mother's death Mr Bale so was the merchant called would not return to town till he saw me safely disposed of  About three days after I had wrote to lady Manning I received a letter from her which was brought by one of her servants in which after the usual compliments of condolance she desired I would set out immediately with the person whom she had sent to attend me My guardian for so I used now to call Mr Bale coming in I told him I must prepare to be gone immediately and gave him lady Manning's letter to read  How are you to go miss said he after he had looked over the letter As I never doubted but lady Manning had sent her postchaise or chariot for me I told him I supposed there was a carriage come with the messenger  O yes replied Mr Bale there is a very good pillion and you are to ride behind the footman I took notice of the equipage as I came in but I shall not permit you to perform a journey of thirty miles in that manner therefore miss I would have you send a letter to the lady by her messenger and inform her that your guardian will convey you safe to her seat  I was as much pleased with this kind attention in Mr Bale as I was shocked and surprised at the ungenteel manner in which lady Manning had sent for me however I concealed my thoughts of it and wrote such a letter as my guardian desired me The next morning at eight o'clock a postchaise was ready at the door and Mr Bale attending all my cloaths had been packed up the night before and we set out immediately  Lady Manning received us very politely and detained Mr Bale to dinner I thought I could observe something forced in the respect she seemed to pay me and I was particularly disgusted with her using the words  Your guardian  every moment as if in derision of the title I had to one  When Mr Bale went away he took an opportunity to speak to me apart and made me promise him if I should have any reason to be displeased with my situation that I would write to him plainly and he would come himself and fetch me away This tender solicitude in the good old man affected me very sensibly and I could not help shedding tears when I saw him drive away  Lady Manning was extremely inquisitive about his connexion with me and asked me a  great many questions I am very glad said she your affairs are in the hands of so wise a man for surely he who can raise a large estate out of nothing as has been the case with Mr Bale must needs be a very wise man and I don't doubt but he will manage your fortune to the best advantage  I was greatly displeased with the first part of this speech and particularly with the manner in which the word Fortune was drauled out  "The poor trifle I have madam replied I "does not deserve to be termed a fortune  I assure you said she it was very kind in a man of Mr Bale's substance to trouble himself with such inconsiderable matters and it is a great thing for you to be permitted to call such a man guardian  Very true madam replied I with some warmth and I believe Mr Bale thinks it no discredit to be called so by a child of Mr Courteney's whatever her fortune may be  I observed lady Manning to reden at this reply which at that time surprised me and I could not conceive the reason of it but I soon found that it was a mortal crime in her eyes to pretend to derive any advantage from birth There was nothing which she seemed to hold in greater contempt than familypride  and indeed when unseasonably exerted it is contemptible but it was plain that lady Manning did not think meanly of the fortuitous advantage of being wellborn because she envied those who possessed that advantage and tho' the daughter of a soapboiler herself she was extremely fond of being thought to have ancestors and it was to gratify her pride that her husband who was a rich citizen by trade a brewer got himself knighted that together with a very large jointure he might leave his wife the title of lady  "Surely" interrupted miss Woodby  this woman had no good intentions when she invited you to her house it is impossible that such low creatures can have any notion of friendship or generosity  "You have guessed truly" replied miss Courteney  it was to gratify her pride to have the daughter of a gentleman subjected to her caprice and dependent on her bounty that made her so solicitous of having me with her but although I did not make these reflections immediately yet I was so disgusted by this first conversation that I could not promise myself any great happiness in such society  Her daughter was now introduced to me a tall aukward thing about seventeen she was  an heiress and being taught to believe that riches give birth beauty wit and every desirable quality she held every one in contempt who was not possessed of this advantage and because she had it herself she supposed she had all the others  Whatever documents were given her they were always introduced withConsider miss what a fortune you are a young lady of your fortune How was it possible for a girl thus tutored not to derive insolence from the consideration of her fortune  The governess who had the care of this young lady was not very likely to enlarge her notions Her only recommendation for such a trust was that she could jabber corrupted French without either sense or grammar and miss was taught to parler françoise in a broad provincial dialect for this governess had never seen Paris and perhaps had never been out of the little village where she was born and bred and conversed only with peasants till she came to England to teach language and fine breeding to a great heiress It was very natural for lady Manning to make such a choice who doubtless thought it a great distinction to have a foreigner for governess to her daughter  "Nay my dear" interrupted miss Woodby  lady Manning in this particular does not differ from many persons of the first quality who commit the education of their daughters to low vulgar creatures merely because they are French creatures that in Paris or in any of the chief cities in the provinces would not be thought qualified for a chambermaid to a woman of any fashion yet when driven into England on account of their religion as they all pretend though perhaps it is for want of bread in their own country derive such distinction from their flimsy sacks their powdered hair and their speaking French that they are thought the fittest persons in the world to form the manners of young girls of quality How absurd should we think it in a French woman of quality to entertain an aukward Yorkshire girl with a coarse clownish accent as English governess to her daughter to teach her the language and correct her pronunciation and yet not one in twenty of the Mademoiselles in the houses of our nobility and our French boardingschools are better qualified for such an officeBut I beg pardon my dear for interrupting you so long I long to hear what sort of a life you lived in this rich despicable family  "Truly" said miss Courteney  it was not very agreeable when lady Manning and I were alone she used to entertain me with an account of her forefathers she reckoned up among them half a dozen sheriffs three lordmayors and a long train of aldermen She lamented the death of her husband most pathetically for if he had lived two years longer he would have been elected lordmayor and she would have lived in the Mansionhouse and been queen of the city Her own words  When we were at table and the servants attending she used to turn the discourse upon the misfortunes of my father lament the sad condition to which my mother and I were reduced by his death express great anxiety about my brother and enter into a minute discussion of our affairs  When there was company present she would take notice that I was melancholy and tell me that I must not take misfortunes to heart and then sigh as if she was extremely affected with them herself by which she recommended me to her visiters as an object of compassion and never failed by that means to produce some instance of neglect towards  me so powerfully did that consideration operate upon most minds  She would sharply reprehend her daughter for any supposed want of civility to me and pass over in silence any real one telling her that if miss Courteney had not a fortune yet she was a gentlewoman as well as herself and that no body should be despised for being poor  Such were the continued mortifications that I was obliged to endure from this generous benefactress yet I ought not to call them mortifications because they only excited my contempt about that time I received a letter from my brother in which he informed me that he was going to travel with a young English nobleman whose governor had died suddenly at Leyden and whom he was appointed to succeed upon a very advantageous footing on account of his birth he desired me to draw upon him for what money I had occasion for  I received these insults with the more indifference as I knew I could put an end to them when I pleased by quitting lady Manning's house which I could now do without any inconvenience to myself and foreseeing that this indelicacy in her treatment of me must necessarily end in something too coarse  for me to dissemble my resentment I was willing to stay till she shewed herself in her true colours which would be my justification whenever I quitted her  CHAP II  Wherein familypride awakens those natural affections which familypride had suppressed  IT was not long before I had this opportunity She desired me one day to walk with her in the garden having something to communicate to me greatly to my advantage and after a profound silence of about ten minutes she looked archly at me and asked me if I could guess what she had been doing for me Indeed I cannot Madam replied I Well then I will tell you said she nothing less I assure you than providing you a husband Indeed said I laughing and pray madam who is this intended husband Come come said she gravely before I tell you who he is you must promise me to make no silly objections such as age not being a fine gentleman and the like The person I have in my eye for you is a sober staid man and blessed with means to support you handsomely without  depending upon any body That indeed is something replied I but who is this person Madam I have a good mind said she to tantalize you a little by keeping you in suspencebut in short the person I mean is honest Mr Vellum  Although I expected some very absurd and impertinent proposal yet my imagination had never reached any thing so riciculous as this Mr Vellum for I had had his history from himself some time before He had been taken by her father out of a parishschool because he understood writing and accounts to keep his books for him Upon his young mistress's marriage he was advanced to be a clerk in her husband's office and here having scraped up a little money he made some successful ventures in trade and had acquired about two thousand pounds After Sir John's death my lady made him her steward with a sallary of fifty pounds ayear and he was in this honourable and lucrative post when she proposed him as a husband for me  My surprise was succeeded by a strong inclination to laugh which indeed I took no pains to suppress and pray madam said I has this grave personage expressed any good liking to me  I hope you are not jesting said sheWhy did you expect me to be serious replied I upon such a proposal  Such a proposal miss repeated lady Manning colouring if my daughter was in your circumstances I should not be sorry such a proposal was made to her Very likely madam returned I and it might be more proper than to Mr Courteney's daughter and the niece of the earl of  This may look like vanity my dear miss Woodby but I confess I was excessively shocked at her levelling me with her daughter when riches were out of the question for I was contented to allow her all the superiority she could derive from them Lady Manning made me a smarter answer and delivered with more calmness than I expected from her  If the earl of said she behaved more like an uncle to you miss it would be oftener remembered that you are his niece but as it is I do not know whether it may not be an advantage to you to have it forgot for there are very few gentlemen of small fortunes who would choose an indigent woman of quality for a wife  I hope however madam said I that none but a gentleman will presume to offer himself to me and I shall take care not to justify my uncle's neglect by encouraging any improper addressYou are very much in the right miss said lady Manning one unfortunate marriage in a family is enough  'Tis well madam replied I bursting into tears you mean my father's no doubt but it was no otherwise unfortunate than that it had not the sanction of my grandfather's consent my mother's excellencies justified his choice and she might have had a fortune too though not equal to what he might have expected if it had not been trusted in the hands of a villain who broke to leave his own children fortunes as many other villains have done  This last hint threw lady Manning into some confusion for it was suspected that her grandfather who was a cornfactor had done the like and whether it was that she was afraid of my speaking still plainer or that she was really concerned for having given me such just reason to complain of her she thought fit to beg my pardon for what was past and assured me that whatever I might think of her she was unalterably my friend  In my first emotions of resentment I had resolved to write to Mr Bale and acquaint him with the treatment I had met with which I knew would bring him immediately to my relief but I considered that my leaving lady Manning in disgust might have disagreeable consequences for she would not fail to represent every thing in such a manner as to make me appear in the wrong and the world seldom espouses the part of the oppressed because they who oppress have that on their side which is sure to exculpate them and that is riches besides the summer was now almost past and she talked of going soon to London where I could take an opportunity of leaving her without any noise and of putting myself immediately under my guardian's protection but I was delivered from this disagreeable situation sooner than I expected and by means which I had then no reason to hope for  Lady Manning was desirous of spending a few weeks at Bath before she returned to London A lady happened to be there a that time who I afterwards learned was my great aunt by my father's side and had followed the example of every branch of his family in taking no notice of him after his marriage  This lady lady Manning became acquainted with and not knowing the relation in which she stood to me she began one day to exclaim against the pride and folly of people in low circumstances who expect to be considered on account of their birth producing me as an instance and relating how I had refused an honest man whom she had proposed to me for a husband because he was not a gentleman repeating my own words with a sneer and therefore  Not a proper match for Mr Courteney's daughter  This being the first time she had named me lady Meadows for it was her cried out in some astonishment what madam is that pretty young lady so she was pleased to say that I saw with you once in the rooms Mr Courteney's daughter  Lady Manning answering in the affirmative good heaven said lady Meadows and have I lived to hear one of my family spoken of with such contempt  "One of your family madam interrupted "lady Manning surprised  Yes said lady Meadows one of my family who has done you too much honour to accept of an obligation from you how could you presume to propose your scound  el steward for  husband to my cousin but I will take her out of your hands immediately you shall be paid for her board my nephew's daughter shall not lie under an obligation to any upstart  it  It is not to be doubted that lady Manning replied with great bittterness but lady Meadows from whom I afterwards had these particulars was in too much emotion to listen to her She immediately quittted the wa  for they were on the Parade and getting  her chariot told lady Manning that she was going to her lodgings to fetch me away  Thus my dear miss Woodby did I recover a relation a friend a benefactress in a woman who for many years had had no intercourse with my father and disclaimed him as the rest of his relations had done on account of his marriage she whose resentment could not be softened by time whose compassion could not be awakened by distress she who had silenced the pleadings of nature yet listened to the voice of pride and from a sense of the affront that had been offered her family in the husband proposed to me she did all that a better motive could have suggested her to do  You may imagine I was greatly surprised when a servant informed me that lady Meadows  was at the door in her chariot and desired I would come to her I had often heard my father mention this aunt of his from whom before his marriage he had great expectations I went down stairs in much confusion of mind not knowing what this summons could mean yet presaging some good and as soon as I appeared lady Meadows let down the glass and desired me to come into the chariot Her footman instantly opening the door I got in and placed myself by her expecting when she would speak and anxiously longing for an explanation  Lady Meadows gazed at me in silence during some moments then taking my hand My dear said she in a tender accent you are very like your father Poor Ned added she with some emotion he was not kindly used The tears streamed from my eyes at this mention of my father I observed lady Meadows was greatly affected Oh nature thought I why were thy tender feelings suppressed so long Don't weep my dear said she I will be both father and mother to you  Had I been in another place I should have thrown myself at her feet to express my gratitude for this affectionate promise I could not speak at that moment I took her hand  kissed it and wet it with my tears She kindly wiped my eyes with her own handkerchief then looking again in my face as if with pleasure you are like your mother too I suppose said she I never saw her but I have heard that she was very handsome  This obliging manner of mentioning my mother which I so little expected from her quite subdued me My dear said she what is past cannot be helped you are my daughter now you shall be no longer obliged to lady Manning That wom  n pursued she rising in her temper as she spoke has herself told me the insolence of her treatment of you she then gave me an account of what had passed upon the Parade as I have already related to you  Lady Manning thought to have injured me in your opinion said I and she has made me happy by awakening your tenderness for me I now forgive her for all her insults  But I never will forgive her interrupted lady MeadowsAs soon as we come to my lodgings you shall send for your cloaths and never more enter her doors  I was very unwilling to part with lady Manning in this manner and pressed my aunt to allow me to go and take leave of her civilly  but she positively refused and I found she could not endure the least contradiction which is indeed one of her foibles I therefore contented myself with writing to her and acquainted her with lady Meadows's resolution in my favour I made the best apology I could for leaving her so suddenly and expressed some concern at the misunderstanding there was between lady Meadows and her which made it impossible for me to wait on her  Politeness my dear is sometimes a great tax upon sincerity Lady Manning had certainly treated me very ill and in strict justice I was not obliged to shew any respect to a woman who had violated all the laws of hospitality with regard to me but custom decides arbitrarily in these cases and persons in a certain condition of life make a science of hating one another with all the good breeding and complaisance imaginable  Lady Manning according to this rule returned a civil answer to my letter wished me all happiness and wherever she went let loose all the asperity of her tongue against me One calumny propagated by her hurt me more than all the rest she confidently reported that I had sacrificed my conscience to my interest  and that upon my aunt's promising to settle her whole fortune upon me at her death I had turned Roman catholick for lady Meadows had been perverted to that religion by her husband and like all proselytes was extremely bigotted to her new principles  I thought it became me to discountenance this report as much as possible therefore I was more regular than ever in my attendance at church and although my aunt after we came to London would often have engaged me to go to mass with her intending no doubt to work me to her purpose by degrees yet I constantly and steddily refused to gratify her in this particular though in every other I studied to oblige her as much as possible She would often engage me in argument upon the subject of religion which I generally strove to evade and when I found that would not do I defended myself with great courage and with so much success that she would tell me with an air half smiling ha  angry that I was too hard for her and that she would consign me over to her chaplain  This chaplain whose name is Danvers is a priest of the order of the Jesuits he had been recommended to lady Meadows by her  late husband whose memory she adored and this powerful interest joined to the jesuit's insinuating manners acquired him so great credit with lady Meadows that she governed herself wholly by his advice and that the great work of her salvation might be perfected and her every word and action be under his direction he lived in the house with her where he ruled in a most arbitrary manner his absolute empire over the conscience of my lady rendering his dominion over all that had any dependence on her as uncontroled as he could desire  Here Henrietta stopped observing her friend to look at her watch which produced an exclamation that the reader will find in the following chapter  CHAP III  Which introduces a jesuit to the acquaintance of the reader  "OH my dear" cried miss Woodby  I am in despair to find it is so late I must leave you now but I am so impatient to hear the rest of your story that if you will give me leave I will breakfast with you tomorrow and as soon as my eager curiosity is satisfied we will go together to Mrs Egret's  She then desired a chair might be sent for  and in the mean time said she we will step into the shop I will make a little purchase on purpose to see your landlady whom you seem to dislike so much  "Indeed I do not like her" replied Henrietta "and yet she is mighty civil" "Well" said miss Woodby tripping down stairs  I'll give you my opinion of her when I have studied her a little  Miss Courtency was following her into the shop when perceiving the young gentleman who was there the day before in discourse with Mrs Eccles she pulled miss Woodby by the  sleeve whispering  Don't go in now there is somebody with her  "Indeed but I will" replied miss Woodby who saw the glimpse of a laced coat for which she had always a violent passion "and so shall you likewise"  Saying this she pulled miss Courteney in and swimming up to Mrs Eccles bid her with a lively air show her some ribbons and blond  laces  The young gentleman as soon as the ladies appeared made them a profound bow and fixing his eyes on Henrietta's face seemed to contemplate it with astonishment and delight  Mean time miss Woodby was playing over a thousand fantastick airs and uttering as many pretty absurdities which she had heard admired coming from the mouths of beauties without reflecting that she herself was no beautyMrs Eccles perceived her foible immediately and took occasion when she was showing her some newfashioned caps to tell her that such a one would suit the air of her face that this coloured ribbon was most proper to shew the lustre of her eyes observed that she had wonderful fine hair and begged to know who cut it  Henrietta a little in pain for her friend to whom personal compliments were by no means proper endeavoured to relieve the confusion  she supposed she was under by diverting her attention to something else and asked her opinion of some Dresden work that was lying before them But miss Woodby had no leisure to answer her for the gentleman conceiving that it was easier to introduce some conversation to her than to miss Courteney whose mingled modesty and dignity struck him with awe addressed a trifling question to miss Woodby which she answered with such an affected sprightliness as encouraged him to talk to her with the familiarity of an old acquaintance  Miss Woodby was excessively delighted with his address to her and played off all the  llery of eyes air and wit upon him  opy was it for the young gentleman who courageously bore all her attacks that this she was given from two little grey eyes over which her forehead hung like a precipice and that this form which was thrown into a thousand different attitudes to strike him was so dist  ted by nature as to leave little more for affectation to do  The chair had been waiting half an hour without miss Woodby's perceiving it when Henrietta who was not at all pleased with the figure her friend made told her smiling  that she would not let her stay any longer  for fear she should by that means be disappointed of her company at breakfast the next day  "I vow my dear you are in the right" cried miss Woodby  to send me away for my aunt is waiting supper for me I am a giddy creature  She then desired Mrs Eccles to put up the things she had bought for in the gaiety of her heart she had bought a great many Mrs Eccles obeyed telling her she hoped she should have the pleasure of serving so agreeable a lady again  The gentleman would hand her into her chair which miss Woodby accepted with a very gallant air after she had assured miss Courteney aloud that she would be with her in the morning and told her in a whisper that her landlady was a very pretty behaved woman  Henrietta went up to her chamber directly to the great disappointment of the young gentleman who finding there was no probability of seeing her again that night went away disburthened of a heart which he had left with the charming stranger  She was now summoned to supper by Mrs Eccles who was full of praises of the young lady her visiter  This has been a lucky day to me said she for I have let my first floor  at a very good price considering the season of the year  I am glad of it" said the young lady  That is very obliging of you my dear miss  said Mrs Eccles  and you may still have the use of the diningroom when you have company for my lord wil be seldom at home in the day these lodgings are only to sleep in But how do you like him Is he not a mighty agreeable man Dear soul not a bit of pride in him  Do you mean the gentleman I saw in the shop  said miss Courteney "Yes" returned Mrs Eccles  he is a lord I assure you  "Well" said miss Courteney  I am glad you are not to lose one lodger without getting another for I must leave you tomorrow  "How" replied Mrs Eccles with an altered countenance  I hope you are only in jest  Upon my word I am in earnest  said miss Courteney  I am sorry for it madam  resumed she  but this is very short notice  Henrietta was a little surprised at the peevishness with which she spoke these last words so different from her usual complaisance but she would not seem to take notice of it and only told her that it was not her design to stay more than a few days at this end of the town having  affairs to transact in the city which would oblige her for her own convenience to take lodgings there  Mrs Eccles appeared satisfied with this answer though a cloud hung upon her brow during the whole time they were at supper which miss Courteney shortened as much as possible and retired to her chamber with new prejudices against her landlady that made her rejoice in the prospect of getting away the next day  Miss Woodby came according to her promise to breakfast in a world of spirits and had scarce taken a seat when she asked after the charming fellow who entertained her so agreeably in the shop  Henrietta told her she saw no more of him  for the moment you was gone said she I went up stairs but really my dear I wonder you seemed so pleased with his conversation methought it was very silly and trifling  "Oh" exclaimed miss Woodby  there is an inexpressible charm in the trifling chat of a pretty sensible fellow when we know he submits to it only to please us women  "Truly" said miss Courteney  your sex is not obliged to you for that compliment Must a man then talk nonsense to be acceptable to  us  "Lord how grave you are my dear" said miss Woodby  why don't you know that I am the veriest coquet in nature and take an infinite pleasure in making a wise man look and talk like a fool  "A coquet my dear" interrupted Henrietta surprised "no surely" "Indeed but I am" replied miss Woodby  and I verily think should not be in the least concerned to see a hundred men dying of love for me  Indeed  said miss Courteney  Yes indeed  repeated the other  but why that stare of astonishment are these notions  o new to you  "Why no" hesitated miss Courteney whose astonishment arose from the contemplation of the figure which uttered all this extravagance  I have somewhere met in my course of reading with such fantastical notions but I cannot say that I ever thought I should hear them avowed by a young lady of your good sense  Oh your servant for that compliment  returned miss Woodby bowing  but on the article of vanity we are all foolsBut come my dear make your tea and then resume your story for I die with impatience to hear it  "I wish you would excuse me" said Henrietta  till I am got to Mrs Egret's for I shall  not be easy till I am out of this house  "Why have you such a dislike to this house" said miss Woodby  I protest I think your landlady a mighty civil obliging woman  "Well I don't like her" replied Henrietta  she has let her first floor all on a sudden to the gentleman we saw in the shop  And how does that affect you  interrupted miss Woodby  Henrietta blushed at this question she was not willing to own that she thought there was some design in his coming and expected her friend would have made that inference herself but finding she did not she endeavoured to divert her attention from the hint she had dropped by saying she had set her heart upon going to Mrs Egret's and had told Mrs Eccles that she was to leave her today  "That was very imprudently done of you" said miss Woodby  before you knew whether Mrs Egret could accommodate you with lodgings but own the truth now  pursued  e  did you not put yourself into a flutter upon hearing the gentleman had taken lodgings here  Why I cannot help saying I was startled at it  replied Henrietta  and the more when I heard he was a man of quality for  surely these lodgings are much too mean for a person of that rank  "Is he a man of quality" exclaimed miss Woodby  Oh the dear creatureI protest I am quite in love with him now I do at on a man of quality And pray why should his coming fright you awayAh my dear  said she smiling archly  had I not reason for saying a moment ago that on the article of vanity we are all fools Now are you ready to imagine here is a plot between this young nobleman and Mrs Eccles against your fair self Poor lady  pursued she laughing  this presumptuous knight will certainly carry you away  "You are in a gay humour today" said miss Courteney blushing  but raillery apart it imports me greatly not to be known this lord as Mrs Eccles says he is will no doubt have a great many persons coming after him I may be seen and discovered and if you knew what I have to dread in that case I am sure you would think it reasonable for me to be anxious to get out of this house  You will be in more danger of a discovery at Mrs Egret's  said miss Woodby  he  house is much larger than this and she very seldom without people of fashion in it  But I can keep in my chamber  said Henrietta  And what hinders you from doing so here  said miss Woodby  Ah it is as I suspected you are certainly apprehensive of being conveyed to some island in an immense lake  "But my dear miss Woodby" said Henrietta laughing  why have you changed your mind about my going to Mrs Egret's  "I have not changed my mind" replied miss Woodby  I am ready to do what I promised but it is my opinion that if Mrs Egret cannot furnish you with a lodging you will be very safe here and I will be with you as  often as I can  "Ah my dear" said miss Courteney mimicking the tone she had used to  er  but come write a line to Mrs Egret to know if she has a single room to spare and I shall be satisfied  Miss Woodby immediately complied with  r request and a porter was dispatched to St  mes'sstreet who soon returned with a billet  om Mrs Egret to miss Woodby expressing  r concern that she could not accommodate her  end  Well" said Henrietta when she heard this I find I must be contented to stay here a few days longer but remember I claim your promise  to be with me as often as you can" "That you may depend upon" said miss Woodby  and now I claim your's to finish your history I am impatient to hear how you came off with this doughty chaplain  CHAP IV  In which our heroine engages herself in a w  y unequal contest  "I Must confess" said miss Cour  ency resuming her narrative  that I had no inclination to engage in a religious dispute with a man whose learning and abilities gave him so many advantages over me therefore whenever he gave the conversation that  n I generally took refuge in silence not being willing to hurt a cause I had so much at heart by defending it weakly  However I was often drawn in to answer by some apparent absurdity advanced by him which it seemed mighty easy to refute On these occasions Mr Danvers would listen to me with wonderful attention observe the most minute exactness in his reply as if what I had urged had indeed great force nay  he would sometimes seem a little prest by my arguments pause for a few moments as if he found it necessary to collect all his strength against so potent an adversary and after a wellturned compliment on my understanding he would resume the argument in which he never failed to puzzle though he could not convince me but always concluded with a declaration that I was too hard for him and it was well he had the best side of the argument for nothing but truth could stand against such subtilty of reasoning  These praises always left me in a very good disposition to renew the subject whenever an opportunity offered I began to be extremely fond of disputing with the chaplain and instead of shunning it as I used to do I even invited his opposition  I have heard it observed that vanity cheats many a woman out of her honour I am sure it was well nigh cheating me out of my religion for this jesuit by his insidious praises had given me such a confidence in my talent of reasoning that I began to believe if he did not make a proselyte of me I should certainly make one of him and in my eager pursuit of victory I sometimes engaged myself  beyond my strength and received such checks that if my faith was not overthrown yet it was strangely staggered but some disgust which I took to the manners of the chaplain preserved me from the poison of his doctrine and made me lose all my relish for arguing with him  My aunt who was certainly very desirous of my conversion was much pleased with her chaplain's zeal to forward so great a work and that she might give no interruption to our discourse she would often leave us alone for several hours together  At such times the jesuit would be very lavish of his compliments and praises of which my person would even come in for a share He would gaze on my face till he lost the chain of his discourse and by his inattention to what he was saying gave me many advantages over him and often while he was pursuing his argument with great warmth he would lay his hand on mine hold it for several minutes together and press it so violently that I could hardly help crying out  All this however would not have startled me but one day taking occasion upon something I had said to break into an exclamation  of surprise at my prodigious understanding he kissed my hand in a kind of rapture and having once taken this liberty he repeated it several times to my great confusion and surprise  These are suspicions my dear which against persons of a certain character one dare not even avow to one's self I was shocked yet would not venture to examine why I could never endure to be alone with him yet never asked myself the reason my eyes as it were mechanically avoided his his civilities were odious to me If he enquired after my health I answered him coldly without knowing I did so and when he launched into any of his usual praises I was downright rude to him yet scarce perceived it myself  I now so carefully shunned being alone with him that notwithstanding he sought opportunities of engaging me in private which heightened my disgust yet he never could find any This conduct if he had any guilt in his heart must certainly give him cause to think I had detected it and indeed I soon found by my aunt's altered behaviour that he was endeavouring to undermine me in her affection  The little peevishness I observed in her towards me I imputed at first to her chagrin at my having disappointed her wishes in not becoming a convert to that religion she professed but I soon found that she had been made to conceive strange notions of me She objected to the gaiety of my disposition she did not like that crowd of lovers as she phrased it that followed me and were encouraged by my coquet airs and the pleasure I shewed in being admired  It is certain that the report of the fortune my aunt designed for me procured me addresses from several men whom as she did not approve so neither did I encourage having in reality none of that sort of vanity which is gratified by a great many pretenders of this kind nor did I feel the least partiality to any one of them so that I told her it would give me no uneasiness if she forbid their visits for the future which since I found they were disagreeable to her I would have done myself if I had thought it became me to take that liberty in her house This declaration would not satisfy my aunt she had further views I must marry and she must choose a husband for me without leaving me in an affair that so  nearly concerned my happiness even a negative voice  I have no doubt but that the person she pitched upon was recommended to her by the chaplain he was a Roman catholic baronet had a good estate was not much above sixty years of age his person just not horrible and he was not quite a fool This was the man whom my aunt proposed to me or rather commanded me to accept for he had modesty enough not to try to engage my affections till he had secured her consent and was admitted in form to make his addresses to me  My aunt indeed allowed that there was some disproportion in our years but then he had a good estate and I was wholly dependent upon her his person she acknowledged was not very amiable but he was a baronet and could give me a title to be sure she said he was not a man of bright parts but he would make a good settlement on me and concluded with assuring me that my chearful consent would greatly endear me to her which I should find by the disposition she would make in her will  My aunt having thus anticipated every objection I could make and in her opinion  fully answered them all I thought it would be to no purpose to dispute with her on points already decided I therefore contented myself with declaring that I could not like Sir Isaac Darby for that was his name that I should be miserable if I married him that I was extremely happy in my present situation and had no wish to change it  Lady Meadows I perceived was a little offended at this so positive a declaration but I had nothing for it but steadiness I expected said she more compliance from that sweetness I have been fond of supposing in your temper and from your good sense a greater attention to your own interest I assured her that it was and ever should be my sincerest endeavour to avoid offending her that I would admit no offer but such as she should approve and that I would guard my heart against any preference which was not authorised by her more than this I told her was not in my power to promise for no consideration of interest could prevail upon me to give my hand to a man whom it was impossible for me either to love or esteem  Finding she listened to me patiently I urged every argument my imagination could furnish me with to prove to her that such an engagement  entered into upon pecuniary motives only could not be happy and might be very miserable I begged she would not think of disposing of me in marriage till I seemed less satisfied with my present happy lot and that by giving me no superior duties in domestic life to fulfil she might entitle herself to all my undivided cares affection and assiduity  My aunt seemed affected with what I said she told me she had no intention of forcing my inclination that loving me so well as she did it was natural for her to wish to see me settled that Sir Isaac Darby was a very advantageous offer she recommended to me to consider well what I refused and to conquer my unreasonable dislike of him if possible  If it were possible madam replied I your command would make me attempt it but No more buts now Henrietta interrupted my auntSir Isaac dines here today remember I expect you will treat him civilly at least since he has so great a regard for you  I smiled courtesied and went out of the where this long conversation had been hold for I heard the chaplain's step in my aunt's dressingroom and this being the hour when he generally joined us I chose to avoid seeing him then for fear he should prevail upon her  to exact something more than civility from me to the odious wretch who had thus bartered for me without my consent  I did not appear in the diningroom till dinner was ready to be served my antiquated lover approached with a janty air and a sliding bow and O don't you pity me my dear kissed my hand as he led me to my seat Nothing but the respect I owed my aunt could have hindered me from laughing at this ridiculous display of gallantry in the old man for age has no claim to our reverence if not accompanied by those qualities from whence it derives its worth Wisdom gravity experience the triumph of reason over passions prejudice and folly all these we expect to find in fulness of years and these make its wrinkles not only respectable but even lovely  In Sir Isaac Darby age was contemptible as well as unlovely he wanted to be young in spite of time he talked and laughed aloud he strutted about the room he adjusted his bag for he was drest up to five and twenty he hummed a tune I sat staring with astonishment at him When we were placed at table I found myself opposite to him and observing that he chewed his meat with great difficulty  for want of teeth I was resolved to mortify him by letting him perceive that I observed it looking at him several times with a kind of sensibility for this so unavoidable a misfortune  From what had passed between my aunt and I in the morning I had no reason to imagine that Sir Isaac would be treated as a declared and authorised lover but some time after dinner was over Mr Danvers withdrew and my aunt upon some trifling pretence following him I was left alone with the old baronet I would instantly have quitted the room but remembring that my aunt had required civility of me at least I resolved not to affront him by leaving him to himself and since I was obliged to stay I would draw some amusement from the ridiculous scene before me  I know not whether it was from any particular archness in my looks just then for I had composed my countenance to a kind of forced gravity or whether the old man was at a loss in what manner he should form his address but it is certain that all his confidence seemed now for the first time to forsake him and he sat silent during several minutes stealing a glance at me every now and then while I with a formal air played my fan and increased  his confusion by my silence At length he quitted his own chair for that which my aunt had sat in and which was next me and drawing it still nearer to me he made a motion to take my hand which I withdrew as hastily as if a snake had touched it  This action a little disconcerted him but taking courage again after a preluding hem he began Charming miss Courteney I don't doubt but lady Meadows has informed you of the violence of myHere an unlucky cough interrupted his speech and held him so long that he grew black in the face his endeavours to suppress it having as I believe almost choaked him I rose up in a seeming  ight as if I had designed to call for assistance but finding his cough had ceased I sat down again at a greater distance than before  I fancy the town air does not agree with you sir said I it is certainly very bad for asthmatical disorders  Oh madam said he this is no asthma I got a slight cold the other night at SpringGardens for we staid very late and the ground was damp but I came off better than any of my companions two or three of whom are still laid up with colds But tell me dear miss Courteney did you receive favourably  the declaration your aunt made in my name may I hope or am I doomed to despair whined out the superannuated enamorato with an hideous ogle which he designed for a languish  Oh good sir replied I excessively shocked at his folly these Arcadian strains do not become your wisdom and gravity My aunt did mention your proposals to me but I cannot accept them I have no inclination to change my condition  How admirably this pretty seriousness sits on those sweet features said the wretch looking confidently at me without being in the least mortified with my rebuke But my dear miss Courteney you must change your mindindeed you mustand your condition too my fair one  "Perhaps I may sir said I  "Oh that charming perhaps said he it restores "me to life  Was there ever any thing so provoking my dear I protest I could hardly help abusing the ridiculous old man  I really think sir said I looking at him with infinite contempt that my seriousness would become your age as well as my youth but pursued I rising to put an end to all  your hopes be pleased to know that I am determined never to give my hand till I can give my heart with it for I have no notion of being perjured at the altar and of vowing to love honour and obey when it is impossible for me to do either  I went out of the room when I had said these words leaving the baronet to mumble the ends of his fingers with his gums for he affected to bite his nails as some persons who really have teeth do when they are angry  I met my aunt as I was going to my own chamber What Henrietta said she have you left sir Isaac alone I suppose you have treated him rudely but come you must return with me I will if you insist upon it madam said I but I had much rather be excused Indeed said my aunt looking a little angrily on me and with that grave face too but I shall not insist upon it miss and so you may go up to your own room if you please  Although I was very glad to be at liberty to retire yet my aunt's permission was given in such a manner that I saw she was offended with me for desiring it I had experienced  the obstinacy of her temper on several occasions and I was convinced that if she set her heart upon marrying me to the baronet she would use her utmost endeavours to carry her point and the loss of her favour might probably be the consequence of her disappointment  CHAP V  Containing an account of some difficulties our heroine was involved in arising from an old exploded notion that interest ought not to be the sole consideration in marriage  FULL of these melancholy reflections I resolved to write to Mr Bale acquaint him with what had passed and intreat his advice in the uneasy and perplexed state of my mind Not that I had the least intention of being governed by it if he recommended to me compliance with my aunt's commands in favour of the baronet but this I was well assured from his good sense and natural rectitude of mind he would not do since it could never be supposed that such a man could be my choice but I was willing to stand clear in his opinion and pay him that deference  that was due to the quality of guardian which he had so kindly assumed  I had been writing near three hours for I had given him a circumstantial detail of every thing that had passed with regard to the baronet whose character I treated with great contempt but what was worse my aunt herself did not escape some satirical strokes of my pen for her ready concurrence with the old man's proposals and although I mentioned her as it was my duty with all imaginable love and respect yet I could not help humorously raillying upon some of her notions which were really odd enough and I placed them in the most glaring light  The prodigious length of my letter first gave me notice that I had been a long time thus employed and looking at my watch I found it was past our usual hour for tea and wondered that I had not been summoned down stairs I therefore made haste to conclude my letter that I might send it to the post when my aunt unfortunately entered the room I started up from my chair when I saw her and hastily crushing the letter all in my hand I put it into my pocket not without betraying some signs of confusion  So Henrietta said my aunt have I caught you Caught me madam said I considering whether she might not have been looking over my shoulder while I was writing so saucily about her for guilt like love makes every thing seem possible that we fear Yes said she have you not been writing Nay don't deny it pursued she for I hesitated and knew not what to say left she should desire to see my letter it is no wonder that poor sir Isaac Darby was rejected with so much scorn when there is a favoured lover with whom you correspond privately  Bless me madam cried I who has told you so I correspond privately with a favoured lover This is some cruel calumny invented by an enemy to deprive me of your good opinion Well said my aunt shew me the letter you conveyed so hastily into your pocket upon my appearance and then I shall know what to think  You never madam replied I used to desire to see my letters nor would you now but in consequence of some suspicion very unfavourable to me That suspicion interrupted my aunt whatever it is will be greatly  strengthened by your refusing to shew me what you have been writing  Surely madam replied I that is not just I may have been writing to Mr Bale or to my brother To your brother said my aunt I am certain you was not writing because you have not heard from him for several months and don't know how to direct to him which indeed was but too true It is possible that you were writing to Mr Bale but why refuse to shew me your letter you can have no transactions with him that I ought not to be acquainted with but I am persuaded that letter was not designed for Mr Bale and there needs no more to convince me that you are carrying on a private and therefore an improper correspondence than your thus obstinately refusing to shew it me  My aunt had reason for what she said nothing was more easy if I was really innocent than to shew her the letter which would remove her suspicions but this as I had managed that fatal letter it was impossible for me to do By not shewing it I confirmed those suspicions she had so unjustly conceived which might indeed have disagreeable consequences but by shewing it I was  sure to incur her resentment for the liberties I had taken with her  How did I that moment inwardly regret my vanity which had suffered me to railly the faults of a person on whom I so absolutely depended merely to display my wit I was so vexed at the dilemma to which I had reduced myself that I burst into tears  Oh I see how it is said my aunt keep your letter Henrietta I am convinced sufficiently She hurried out of my chamber at these words Shocked to the soul at having thus incurred the imputation of entertaining a secret lover I went after her resolving in that first emotion to shew her the letter and rather be thought ungrateful to her than guilty of an imprudence so disadvantageous to my character but she was already at the bottom of the stairs and I had time to make new reflections which prevented my former purpose  I considered that since there was no foundation for her fears that I listened to a private address I might easily find means to undeceive her and justify myself but if I shewed her a letter in which she was mentioned with so great freedom I might possibly never be able to remove those ill impressions of me  which she would doubtless receive and I should be all my life branded for ingratitude  I was so terrified at this thought that I resolved to put it out of my power to expo  myself to such a misfortune by destroying the fatal letter which I did with a precipitation that left no time for second thoughts When this was over I expected to have found myself more calm and easy but it was quite otherwise I had given foundation to believe that I was engaged in a loveintrigue for surely all clandestine addresses may be termed so since there is too much mystery contrivance and little arts necessary to them not to give great pain to a delicate mind I burst into tears at the reflection My aunt's woman who had a very tender regard for me came into my chamber and finding me so disordered begged to know what had happened  I related every thing that had passed between my aunt and I but did not own to all the little freedoms I had taken with her in my letter yet said enough to convince her that I could not well show it to my aunt  Mrs White for that was her name was very much concerned for my situation she told me that her lady and Mr Danvers were  in close conference It is certainly he said she who has infused these suspicions into my lady which by this unfortunate circumstance of the letter are now confirmed she gave me such plain hints of the chaplain's selfish dispositions and designs that it seemed highly probable he would spare no artifices to lessen my aunt's affection for me for since he had failed in making me a convert which perhaps might have answered other views he was desirous of keeping my aunt entirely to himself and so manage her conscience which he had the direction of as that holy motherchurch and he might divide her spoils  All this considered my condition seemed so dangerous that I begged Mrs White to send a porter with a message from me to Mr Bale desiring to see him for I resolved to regulate my conduct on this occasion wholly by his advice She left me to do what I had desired her and I remained alone in my chamber till nine o'clock at which time I was summoned to supper  I found only my aunt and Mr Danvers I was a little confused for knowing what suspicions I laboured under in my aunt's mind I thought I had the air of a guilty person and  I felt that I blushed and blushed the more for that reason  My aunt looked very coldly upon me Mr Danvers looked like one that was very much concerned that all was not well between us my aunt scarce spoke three words during supper it was not my part surely to talk much and Mr Danvers accommodated himself to the present temper of my aunt so that this was a very gloomy meal  When the cloth was removed I was going to withdraw for it seemed as if my presence was a restraint upon my aunt but I considered that such a step being unusual would imply a consciousness of something wrong in me and that being innocent it was my part to seck an explanation I therefore addressed myself to my aunt and begged she would give me an opportunity of clearing myself by testing me who had poisoned her mind with suspicions to my prejudice  The chaplain was about to leave the room upon my entering on this subject There is no necessity sir said I for your r  g I dare say the cause of my aunt's displeasure against me is no secret to you My aunt has been told that I receive addresses from some man in private and that I correspond with  him I declare this to be absolutely false and I beg to know from whom you had your information madam said I again directing myself to her that I may refuse this calumny I am very confident the person who has thus maliciously injured me will not dare to maintain the falshood to my face  Whether the chaplain thought this was meant for him I know not but although he had continued standing as if he intended to leave us to ourselves yet I had no sooner uttered these last words than he resumed his seat immediately as if he would shew me he was not in the least affected by them but I observed that he fixed his eyes upon my aunt and expected her answer with some emotion  Before I comply with your condition said my aunt do you Henrietta agree to mine let me see that letter you wrote today I looked at the chaplain I saw an alteration in his countenance he was evidently more composed Oh thought I sighing how great would my triumph be if I had this letter to show and could show it without fear  You hesitate Henrietta pursued my aunt why if that letter was not to a lover why do you refuse to produce it I declare madam said I upon my word and honour that the  letter was to Mr Bale Well let me see it said my aunt and I shall be satisfied I cannot show it to you madam replied I in a faultering accent for I dreaded the inference that would be drawn from what I was going to confess I have torn it Well said my aunt with a calmness that cost her some pains to maintain and why did you fear it▪ it was not written to be torn that is certain But I will answer for you niece you tore it that I might not see it and why might I not see it if it was to Mr Bale Again I p  st said I that it was to him but I did not chuse to let you see it it was a long letter full of impertinences you would have thought I was very free in my observations on some particular persons more free than became me perhapsYou might have been offended and I tore it to prevent your seeing it  My aunt looked down paused and seemed not wholly dissatisfied with my manner of accounting for the reluctance I shewed to deliver my letter to her but before she would declare herself it was necessary she should consult her oracle and that could not be done before me She therefore put an end to the conversation by ringing the bell for her woman I attended her to her chamber at the door of  which she bade me good night telling me she would talk further with me in the morning  I endeavoured to make Mrs White comprehend by a look I gave her unobserved that I wished to speak to her and accordingly she came to me after my aunt was in bed and delivered the answer the porter had brought from Mr Bale's he was out of town but expected back in a week or two was what the servants told him  Mrs White repeated her offers of service to me but dropped some expressions that shewed she would be glad to be assured that I really had no secret engagement which might justify my aunt's concern  These doubts hinted with great respect were so far from being resented by me that I conceived the better opinion of her discretion and confided absolutely in her sincerity I made her quite easy with regard to the subject of her fears and she repaid this condescension with the kindest assurances of attachment to me and care of my interests  I went to bed full of hope that I had in part removed my aunt's suspicions and relying on my innocence I was persuaded I should soon restore myself to her good opinion  but innocence is not always a security to its possessor because malice attains its ends by arts which a good mind cannot conceive and therefore is unable to guard against  Mrs White informed me in a whisper as I was going into my aunt's dressingroom next morning where we always breakfasted that her lady and the chaplain had been talking together for half an hour I drew no favourable omen from this intelligence nor from my aunt's looks which were very cold and constrained  When breakfast was over and Mr Danvers had withdrawn I expected she would enter into some conversation with me on the subject of the letter but finding she talked of different things I took occasion to mention it myself and begged to know if she had any doubts still remaining in her mind  Surely replied my aunt you think I am a person that can be very easily imposed upon Then you are resolved madam said I with some peevishness for indeed I was horridly vexed to find her so strongly prejudiced to believe I encourage a clandestine address notwithstanding every appearance to the contrary  No indeed interrupted my aunt I am not so unreasonable miss it is because there are very strong appearances against you that I am forced to believe what you would not have methat letter Henriettabut no more on this subject at present I am going to my house near Windsorforest tomorrow we shall there have leisure enough to talk over this affair and there I shall open my mind freely to you I courtisied and was silent  My aunt took me with her to pay some morning visits and seemed to be in very good humour but her words that she would open her mind freely to me at Windsor gave me a great deal of anxiety I did not doubt but I was to be prest again on the subject of sir Isaac Darby and I was prepared for an obstinate resistance but I was apprehensive that this resistance to my aunt's will meeting with the unaccountable suspicions she had entertained would infallibly ruin me with her O my brother thought I why are you not here to countenance and protect me or why have you so long neglected me as to leave me in suspence whether I have a brother or not  This thought and several others no less painful spread an air of pensiveness and melancholy  on my countenance which my aunt as I perceived by some hints that dropped from her interpreted to my disadvantage In short my dear she imputed my pensiveness to the concern I was under at leaving town as I could not expect to have many opportunities of seeing at Windsor this lover that had possession of my heart  You cannot imagine miss Woodby how much I suffered in being obliged to restrain my indignation at being thus treated to have a phantom of a lover conjured up to  me with and to combat suspicions which had not the least foundation but in prejudice and caprice against which plain truth and reason were very unequal arms for how should reason remove what would never have been admitted if reason had not been first  a  Nothing was ever more improbable than that I should have a secret lover I never went  where without my aunt her visitors were mine I could see no body without her knowledge how was this engagement formed But her chaplain had doubtless assured her that I had a secret engagement and she piously believed him in contradiction to her own judgment this was one of those cases that required an implicit faith and in matters of  faith you know Roman catholicks are not permitted to exercise their reason  We set out next morning for Windsor the chaplain and my aunt's woman being in the coach the conversation was wholly upon indifferent things After dinner was over my aunt took me into her closet and entered into a long discourse which it would tire you to repeat but the substance of it was my unhappy situation when she took me out of the hands of lady Manning her tenderness for me the great things she designed to do for me nothing less than making me her sole heir the folly of marrying for love exemplified in my father's marriage her fears that I was going to throw myself away on some young fop who would make me miserable sir Isaac Darby's generous passion for me his great estate the handsome settlements he proposed to make and lastly the pleasure I would give her by suiting in this case my inclinations to my interest  To all this I answered very particularly I acknowledged she had shewn a parental tenderness for me and I had paid her and ever would pay her I said the duty and obedience due from a child to a parent that in the article of marriage my natural parents would  certainly have allowed me a negative voice which was all I claimed now since I was absolutely resolved not only never to marry without her consent but not to admit of any address which she disapproved I begged her never to propose sir Isaac Darby to me again because my heart wholly rejected him tho' at the same time I protested as I might well do that my affections were entirely disengaged  All your asseverations replied my aunt who had listened to me with many signs of impatience signify nothing without you many sir Isaac Darby and by that only shall I be convinced that your head does not run upon some wild showy fellow who will make your heart ake  Here continued she is a baronet of an ancient family a large estate of good morals not disagreeable in his person but what is person in a man who loves you who will make you a large jointure who gives you a title place equipage all that a prudent sensible woman can desire and you refuse him grant that he is older than you he has the more wisdom O my dear how difficult it was for me to forbear laughing here but you are not in love with him let me tell you Henrietta that is not a plea for a young  woman of delicacyWhat is it not possible for you to make a good wife to an honest gentleman without bringing with you all that romantick passion which forces girls to jump out of windows to get to their fellows and for the sake of a man who possibly a few weeks before was an absolute stranger to them break through every tie of natural affection and to be a wife be contented to be neither daughter sister or niece  I was going to speak My aunt in a peremptory manner laid her hand on my mouth I will not hear a word more said she on this subject if you refuse to give your hand to sir Isaac I know what I am to thinkI give you two days to consider of it I have hitherto treated you as my own child if you comply you shall find me a mother if not I am only your aunt and you know how some who stand in that degree of relation to you behave This was pretty plain my dear I was so shocked that I suffered my aunt to go out of the closet without making any answer and retired to my own chamber to weep in freedom  CHAP VI  In which our heroine is very reasonably alarmed  IT was indeed true that my father's family took no notice of me notwithstanding the applications that had been made to them and when my aunt Meadows introduced me at my uncle's the earl of I was received so coldly by him and his lady that I inly resolved never to expose myself to such a mortification again and my aunt entered so far into my just resentment as never to press me to make them a second visit  My brother was abroad if living he neglected me and perhaps I had no brother for how else could I account for so long a silence in one who seemed to have such tender affections I had no resource but in Mr Bale's friendship and he was at this time unluckily at too great a distance to be of any use to me I saw plainly that I must either accept sir Isaa  Darby's hand or be thrown back into m  former indigence and dependenceDreadfu  alternative But the man considered was there room to pause long  My imagination suggested to me every possible ill consequence of the loss of my aunt's favour but weighed against the misery of such a marriage they all seemed lightYet would you think it my dear amidst the many real evils I had reason to apprehend by disobliging my aunt one trifling circumstance dwelt strongest upon my mind and that was the occasion of triumph I should give to lady Manning who would exult over my fallen expectations and return to indigence I was ashamed of my own weakness when I found this thought capable of giving me so much pain and in the contemplation of greater misfortunes which were likely to be my lot I sought to blunt my sense of these lesser ones which were the necessary consequences of them  Towards evening Mrs White threw herself in my way as I was walking pensive in the garden She told me that my aunt was full of hopes that I would comply that sir Isaac was to be invited tomorrow and that it was expected the generosity of his proposals with regard to settlements the rich presents of jewels which he would offer and his resolution  to agree to every thing I desired would make such an impression on my mind as to induce me to give a free and willing consent Mrs White added that since my aunt was so determined upon concluding this match she wished I could conquer my aversion to it for she feared that my absolute refusal would so irritate her that she might be easily persuaded to take some violent resolution against me and there is one said she who will spare no pains to bring that to pass  I replied that nothing which could befal me from the loss of my aunt's favour was to be dreaded so much as being the wise of sir Isaac Darby and that my resolution was fixed Mrs White sighed shrugged her shoulders and hastened from me for fear of being observed seeming as I thought to believe my case desperate  When she was gone I considered that if I accepted of the two days my aunt had given me to come to a resolution I should be exposed during that time to the odious courtship of sir Isaac whose presence was it seems judged necessary to influence me I therefore determined to declare myself immediately and plunge at once into the distresses that awaited me  I left the garden instantly and went in search of my aunt as soon as I entered the room where she was she laid down a book she had been reading and looked earnestly at me seeming by my countenance on which I believe was impressed the agitation of my mind to expect something extraordinary  You have indulged me madam said I with two days to consider of your proposal with regard to sir Isaac Darby but so long a time is not necessary were any thing less at stake than the future happiness of my life you should find me incapable of opposing your will but in this case it is not possible for me to obey you Judge of my aversion to that man when I protest to you that if death or his hand was an alternative that I must chuse I would without hesitation prefer death as the lesser hardship  This determined speech seemed to surprise my aunt though I think she had no reason to expect I could ever be prevailed upon to marry sir Isaac  You are an undone girl said she after a pause of near three minutes I believe your father's folly is hereditary to youI have done my dutyYour obstinacy be upon your own head  I confess I was greatly affected with her calm resentment so likely to be lasting I burst into tears she went out of the room I followed her into another where Mr Danvers was sitting As soon as I perceived him I hastily withdrew for I was not willing to be seen by him in that state of dejection I retired to my own room and there after I had relieved my mind by another flood of tears I endeavoured to soften my own apprehensions of what might be the effects of having disobliged the only relation who would own me and collected all my fortitude to enable me to bear the worst that could happen But that worst my dear proved so terrible to my frighted imagination that to avoid it I have taken a very imprudent and dangerous step and whither it will lead me Heaven knows for my heart forebodes some fatal consequence from it  "Lord bless me" said miss Woodby  after escaping such an odious husband as sir Isaac was any thing worse to be feared  "Ah" cried miss Courteney  but it was not certain whether I should escape him for if my aunt's scheme had taken place I had every thing to fear  What could your aunt's scheme be  said miss Woodby impatiently  "Mr Danvers's rather" said miss Courteney "and its being his made it more "formidable  My aunt seemed so easy and chearful at supper and spoke to me so kindly that all my gloomy apprehensions vanished and I was happy in the thought that I should preserve her favour without becoming the wife of sir Isaac Darby but I was soon undeceived Mrs White tapp'd at my door after she had put my aunt to bed I let her in and in a rapture of joy I told her how favourably my aunt seemed disposed and that I should no longer be persecuted about the odious baronet O miss said she I am afraid this calm foretels a storm A storm repeated I what do you mean  I always dreaded said she that Mr Danvers would use his power with my lady to your disadvantage but who could have imagined that he would prevail upon her to send you to France and lock you up in a nunnery  How exclaimed I almost breathless with terror and surpriseConfine me in a nunnery Is it possibleHow came you to know this  By the strangest chance in the world replied Mrs White I am not used to listen  I scorn it but some words that fell from the chaplain alarmed me on your account and I resolved if possible to know what he was driving at This evening pursued she I went to my lady to take her directions about some laces I was making up for her I found the chaplain with her they seemed to be in deep discourse and my lady as if angry at being interrupted bid me in a hasty manner come to her another time I went away immediately and just as I shu  the door I heard the chaplain say Depend upon it madam there is no other way to preserve her from ruin Certainly thought I to myself this must concern miss Courteney I put my ear to the keyhole and heard my lady answer But shall I not be called a  sending my niece to a convent con  y to her inclinations  The chaplain made a long speech which I could not distinctly hear but he told her she must make a sacrifice of such idle censures to God that it was her duty to endeavour to save a soul that you were in a state of perdition and oh my dear miss but that I cannot believe he assured her you would throw yourself away upon the idle fellow  those were his words that you were in love with if not prevented by bolts and bars  In the end my lady seemed determined and they consulted together about the means they should use to entrap you into a convent My lady proposed making a tour to Paris by way of amusement to take you with her and leave you in some monastery Mr Danvers I found objected to that he desired she would leave the affair wholly to his management and said he would think of some expedient that would be less troublesome to her I did not stay to hear any more for I was apprehensive of some of the servants coming that way and discovering me at so mean a trick as listening  Good God cried I what shall I do what shall I do repeated I passionately in the anguish of my mind My guardian is not in town to whom shall I apply for advice and assistance in this extremity I may be hurried away to this horrid confinement when I least expect it  That is impossible said Mrs White forewarned forearmed as the saying is Since you know what is intended against you you must be upon your guard you cannot be carried away against your will  Mrs White did not appear to me to have a very just sense of the danger I was exposed to for what will not bigotry attempt I was glad therefore when she left me to my own reflections which she did after begging me to be composed and not to discover the manner in which I came by the intelligence she had given me  The latter part of her injunction I faithfully promised to perform but oh my dear miss Woodby how was it possible for me to be composed amidst such dreadful apprehensionsTo be locked up in a gloomy monastery perhaps for ever exposed to the persecutions of superstitious zeal but this was not the worst of my fears To be consigned over perhaps to the care of a wolf in sheep's cloathing who had already shocked my delicacy with freedoms that proceeding from such a man in such a character might well awaken the most frightful suspicions  "Truly" said miss Woodby  that seemed to be the worst part of your danger for I don't like this jesuit at all every thing may be dreaded from a hypocrite but as to the being shut up in a convent there is no great matter in it Such beauty as yours would have soon engaged some adventurous knight in your  cause who would have scaled the walls to have delivered youOh what a charming adventure I protest I would submit to a few months confinement in such a place for the pleasure of being delivered from it in so gallant a manner  "Sure you are not in earnest" said Henrietta "Indeed but I am" replied miss Woodby "Well" resumed miss Courteney  you have very whimsical notions but I assure you none of these entered into my head the loss of liberty seemed to me so frightful a misfortune that I was almost distracted with the idea of it  The first thought that occurred to me and which indeed was the most natural was to prevent my aunt from carrying her designs into execution by leaving her I might well imagine she would use violence to detain me if I attempted it openly therefore it was necessary to steal myself away and this has the air of an adventure you must own but as I had no confident in this design no gallant youth to assist me in my escape and did not even make use of a ladder of ropes or endanger breaking my neck I am afraid this adventure is not in a taste high enough for you  "Oh you are rallying me" said miss Woodby  but I long to know how you escaped no confident how could you manage so arduous an undertaking by yourself  "With great ease I assure you" said miss Courteney  and I don't think you will allow it to be an escape when I tell you I walked peaceably out of a door not without some trepidation however which arose less from the fear of a pursuit than the consciousness that I was taking a step which every young woman of delicacy will if possible avoid  As I have already told you I instantly resolved upon leaving my aunt but where should I seek an asylum Mr Bale whose protection I might have requested with honour was not in town my brother was abroad none of my father's relations would receive me I had no acquaintances but such as were my aunt's to whom any application would have been very improper as I should have found very strong prejudices to combat with it being a received maxim among persons of a certain age that young people are always in the wrong besides one seldom meets with any one who has not that littleness of soul which is mistaken for prudence and teaches that it is not safe to meddle with other people's  affairs which narrow notion prevents many a good office many a kind interposition so that we seem to live only for ourselves  My perplexed mind could suggest no better expedient to me than to seize the first opportunity that offered to go to London and there conceal myself in a private lodging till Mr Bale's return who I doubted not would take me under his protection Before I had fixed upon this resolution great part of the night was wasted so that I lay later than usual the next morning When I went down to breakfast I found my aunt dressed and her coach ordered She took notice that my eyes looked heavy I told her I had a violent headach which indeed was true she said it was a cold and bid me keep myself warm  I am going to Richmond added she it will be late before I return to dinner therefore let the cook get you a chicken when you chuse to dine and don't walk out to increase your cold  My heart leaped so when I found I was to be left at home that I was afraid my emotion was visible in my countenance My aunt however did not observe it for apparently she had no suspicion that I knew any thing of her design to send me to a convent and  therefore she could not possibly guess my intention to leave her But she certainly overacted her part all on a sudden to drop her favourite scheme the marrying me to sir Isaac Darby and when I might reasonably expect that my obstinate refusal to comply with her desires would create some coldness in her towards me to find her not only free from all resentment but even particularly kind and obliging Sure this was sufficient to raise doubts in my mind that something more than ordinary was at the bottom of all this affability  It often happens that cunning overreaches itself for it seldom hits a medium and generally does too much or too little My aunt's behaviour would have led me to suspect that some design was forming against me but if it had not been for Mrs White's information I should never have been able to discover what it was for my own penetration would have gone no further than to suggest that some scheme was laid to bring about my marriage with sir Isaac Darby but this fear would have been sufficient to have winged my flight so that the arts my aunt made use of to lull me into security proved the very foundation of my doubts  I had a new palpitation of the heart when I saw the chaplain follow my aunt into the coach Sure thought I Heaven approves of my design to get away since so many circumstances concur to make it practicable It was natural my dear as my religion was in danger from the persecutions preparing for me to think Heaven interested in the success of my intended escape  There is certainly something very pleasing in supposing one's self the peculiar care of Providence on certain occasions A Roman catholick would have made little less than a miracle of so favourable a concurrence of circumstances However I suppressed this rising sally of spiritual vanity and employed my thoughts in contriving how to get to town with convenience and safety without expecting any supernatural assistance  Here miss Woodby broke in upon the fair narrater with an exclamation that will be found in the following chapter  CHAP VII  In which Henrietta concludes her history  "OH my dear" interrupted miss Woodby laughing  you have given an excellent name to a species of folly which at once excites one's laughter and indignation I know an old lady who is a constant frequenter of the chapel in Oxfordroad that has arrived to such a heighth of spiritual vanity as you justly term it that she  ies Providence is perpetually exerting itself in miracles for her preservation and that her most inconsiderable actions are under the immediate direction of Heaven for she will tell you with surprising meekness and humility that unworthy as she is she is in high favour with God if she happens to stumble against a stone without falling she says with a smile of conscious satisfaction To be sure God is very good to  me  According to her  God acts by partial not by general laws  And should it cease raining immediately before she is to go out either to church or a visit it is all one she supposes that Providence is at that  moment at work for her and has cleared the skies that she may walk with conveniency for she cannot always purchase a coach or a chair half of her little income being appropriated to the preachers from whose doctrine she has imbibed these selfflattering ideas  "Oh" said miss Courteney laughing  you have heightened the colouring of this picture exceedingly  "Upon my word I have not" said miss Woodby  and but that I am not willing to interrupt your story so long I could give you an hundred proofs of this odd species of pride for I assure you my dear the haughtiest beauty in the drawingroom amidst a croud of adorers and in the fullest display of airs and graces has not half the vanity of one of these saints of Whitefield's or Wesley's creation  "I really pity the poor woman you mentioned" said Henrietta  she appears to me to be very far from attaining to any degree of perfection for may it not be supposed that this unreasonable confidence will lead her to neglect many duties very essential to a good christian For I have heard it observed that the preachers of that sect chiefly declaim against fashionable sollies and according to them to dress with elegance  to go to a play or an opera or to make one at a party of cards are mortal sins mean time poor morals are wholly neglected and superstition is made an equivalent for a virtuous life  "Yet a writer" replied miss Woodby  who is greatly admired by our sex and who in his works pays court to all religious ca  ing himself so evenly amidst them that it is hard to distinguish to which he most inclines has introduced these modern saints reclaiming a woman who had led a very vicious life and doing more than all the best orthodox divines had done and he has not thrown away his compliment I dare say this numerous  has bought up an impression of his book and is not the third edition upon the title page a very good return to it Oh my dear there is no vanity like the vanity of some authors it is not to be doubted but if there were  men enough in the kingdom to add a unit more to the account of those editions but we should find him introducing the alcoran making proselytes from luxury But how have we wandered from your story You are still at Windsor I long to hear the rest  "I assure you my dear" said miss Courtency sighing  I have not been sorry for this little interruption it has given some relief to my mind for I know not how it is but the recollection of this period is painful to me and yet under the same terrors and with the same apprehensions I should certainly act again as I have done I think I told you that Mr Danvers went in the coach with my aunt a circumstance with which I had reason to be rejoiced as it greatly facilitated my escape I was still lingering over the teatable uncertain in what manner I should perform my little journey when Mrs White came into the room she was apprehensive that I should be uneasy at my aunt's and the chaplain's excursion together as supposing it was to settle something relating to their scheme and therefore made haste to inform me that my aunt had been summoned to Richmond by a message from a Roman catholick friend of her's who was dangerously ill there and desired to see her together with Mr Danvers who was her ghostly father as they term it  Mrs White continued to talk to me on the subject of my aunt's design while I was considering whether it would be proper to make her the confident of my intended flight to London  and engage her to procure me some vehicle to carry me thither But it was possible she might not approve of my leaving my aunt so suddenly in which case I should find it difficult to get away besides I did not think it reasonable to involve her in the consequences of my flight by making her privy to it and that the only way to enable her to justify herself to my aunt was not to make her guilty I therefore resolved to steal out of the house and go as far as I could on foot not doubting but chance would throw some carriage in my way in which I might finish my journey and to gain all the time I could I told Mrs White that my anxiety had hindered me from sleeping all night that I was not well and would go to my chamber and try to get some repose desiring her not to disturb me  Having thus got four hours at least before me I resolved to write a short letter to my aunt before I went In this letter I told her that having accidentally discovered her intention of sending me to a convent abroad my terrors of such a confinement had forced me to throw myself under the protection of Mr Bale that I hoped through his mediation to convince her I had been guilty of no imprudences which could merit such severe treatment  as a punishment and was not so unsettled in my religion as to be perverted by that or any other means I begged her to believe that except in that article and in marrying contrary to my inclinations I would pay her the same obedience as to a parent but that I would rather submit to the lowest state of poverty than marry a man whom I could neither love or esteem or change the religion in which I was bred and with which I was entirely satisfied I concluded with earnestly intreating to be restored to her good opinion which I assured her I would always endeavour to deserve  Having scaled and directed this letter I put it into one of my dressingboxes not doubting but as soon as I was missing every thing that belonged to me would be searched for letters in hopes of further discoveries I next tied up some linen in a handkerchief and with an aking heart sallied out of my chamber and crossed a passageroom which had steps leading to the garden As soon as I had got out of the backdoor which opened into the forest I concluded myself safe from discovery and mended my pace having no difficulty in finding my way because I pursued  the road which I had often traversed in a coach or a chaise  You will easily imagine my mind was full of melancholy reflections and indeed so entirely was I engrossed by them for near an hour that I did not perceive I was tired till I grew so faint I was hardly able to move a step farther I had now got into the open road and it being about the time when I might expect to see some of the stagecoaches from Windsor pass that way I sat down under the shade of a large tree at some distance from the road impatiently wishing for the sight All this time I had not been alarmed with the fear of meeting with any insult for I had seen no one from whom I could apprehend any such thing but I had scarce enjoyed this comfortable shelter three minutes when I perceived two ill looking fellows as I thought them making towards me with all the speed they were able I started up in inconceivable terror looking round me to see if any help was near if they should assault me when I fortunately discovered the stagecoach and being now eased of my fears I resumed my station till it was come near enough for me to speak to the driver The two fellows who had given me such a terrible alarm stopped  short upon seeing the coach and I really believe I had an escape from them  I called out to the coachman as soon as he could hear me You know my dear the difficulties I found in getting admission Little did those good women who refused it imagine that to avoid a slight inconvenience to themselves they were consigning me over to the greatest distress imaginable  "Wretches" exclaimed miss Woodby  I cannot think of them without detestation but my dear pursued she did not you wonder to see a person of any figure in a stagecoach As for you I soon discovered there was something extraordinary in your case but what did you think of me with such company and in such an equipage  "Indeed my dear" said miss Courteney  at that time a stagecoach appeared to me a most desirable vehicle and I had not then the least notion of its being a mean one so greatly do our opinions of things alter with our circumstances and situations besides a difficulty then occurred to my thoughts which amidst the hurry and precipitation with which I quitted my aunt's house had not been sufficiently attended to before and that was how I should dispose of myself for a few days till Mr Bale's  return for it was necessary I should conceal myself with great care having so much to apprehend from my aunt's bigotry and prejudices and the perhaps interested officiousness of her chaplain  Under what strange disadvantages had I lodgings to seek for by an assumed name with an immediate occasion for them and no recommendation to any particular house which I could be sure was a reputable one Your politeness and the unexpected offer of your friendship encouraged me to communicate my distress to you and to intreat your assistance and I must still regret the  lucky mistake that brought me hither instead of M  s Egret's And now my dear you have my whole story before you Have I not been very unfortunate and am I not in a men dreadful situation But what it chiefly concerns me to know does your judgment acquit me of imprudence and folly in this pr  pi  te flight from my aunt to whom I owed so many benefits and on whom I depended  o  support  "Approve your flight" cried miss Woodby  Yes certainly child who would not fly from a bigot a priest and an old hideous  lover I protest I would in your case have done the same thing  Well that is some comfort  replied miss Courteney  but every body will not think as you do and to a mind of any delicacy s  nothing is so shocking as to have a reputation to defend and the step I have taken will no doubt expose me to many unfavourable censures  "And do you imagine" said miss Woodby  that with a form so pleasing and an understanding so distinguished you will be exempted from the tax that envy is sure to levy upon merit Don't you know what the most sensible of all poets says  "Envy will merit as it's shade pursue  "And like a shadow proves the substance "true  Take my word for it it is no great compliment we pay to persons when we tell them that all the world speaks well of them for those who are remarkable for any shining qualities will be more envied than admired and frequently more calumniated than praised But child  pursued the volatile miss Woodby assuming a sprightly air  how do you intend to dispose of yourself today it is late I must go home to dress  "Dispose of myself" repeated miss Courteney  even in this solitary chamber for am determined since I must stay here a day or two longer to be as little with my landlady a  possible  Miss Woodby then fluttered down stairs followed by her fair friend who took that opportunity to tell Mrs Eccles that she should not leave her so suddenly as she had imagined which was very agreeable news to the millenor who had no other objection to her beautiful lodger but her extreme reserve which did not at all suit her purposes  CHAP VIII  Containing nothing either new or extraordinary  MISS Courteney after having traversed her chamber several times in great restlessness of mind at length resolved to take a hackney coach and drive to Mr Bale's supposing she should know from his clerks or servants the exact time when he was expected home at least they could give her a direction where to write to him and it would be some comfort to acquaint him with her situation and have his advice  She had no sooner formed this design than she hastened to put it in execution and having made a slight alteration in her dress she went down to Mrs Eccles and desired her to send her maid for a coach telling her she was obliged to go into the city upon business and desired her not to wait for her at dinner Mrs Eccles insisted upon waiting till four o'clock at least and attended her to the door less out of complaisance than to hear where she ordered the coachman to drive for the enquietude irresolution and pensiveness which she discovered in her fair lodger extremely heightened her curiosity to know her affairs  Henrietta though she did not suspect the motive of her officiousness yet not thinking it proper to let her know where she was going only bid the coachman drive to St Paul's churchyard and when there she gave him a fuller direction Alas sighed she when the coach stopped before the great gates of her guardian's house were the hospitable master of this mansion at home here should I find a secure asylum  As soon as a servant appeared she asked if Mr Bale was at home that she might with greater propriety introduce her farther enquiries but was most agreeably surprised to hear him answer  her in the affirmative while he opened the coachdoor however she ordered the coachman to wait and then followed the servant who introduced her into a large parlour and retired to acquaint his master with her being there  Immediately a young gentleman of an engaging appearance entered the room and desired to know her commands Henrietta seeing instead of her guardian a young man whom she was quite a stranger to blushed at first  a more painful sense of her disappointment soon spread a paleness over her fair face  "Is not Mr Bale at home sir" said she in an accent that shewed her concern  my business was with him  "My father madam" said the young gentleman  is in Holland from whence I c  me myself but lately he has affairs to settle there which will detain him three or four weeks But cannot I serve you madam  added he his voice becoming insensibly softer while he gazed on a form which it was not possible to behold without some sensibility  Pray let me know it will give me great pleasure if I can be in the least degree useful to you  "I shall be obliged to you sir" replied miss Courteney  if you will forward a letter from  me to Mr Bale It is a great unhappiness to me that he is abroad at this time he is my guardian and at present I have need of his advice and assistance  "Pardon me madam" said young Mr Bale "is not your name Courteney" "It is sir" replied she  "Dear miss" said he looking on her with a tender sympathy  I wish my father was at home since you wish soAnd yet perhaps all parents are alike  added he after a pause and sighing  they are too apt to imagine that happiness consists in riches But are you in a place of safety miss Are you sure you are in no danger of being discovered I wish it was in my power to offer you an asylumbut  "Bless me sir interrupted Henrietta in great astonishment  you seem to be perfectly well acquainted with my situation  "Yes madam" said Mr Bale  I know something of your affairs and from my soul I approve of your courage and resolution A gentleman named Danvers was here yesterday to enquire for you your aunt's chaplain is he not  "Yes sir" replied miss Courteney  and my persecutor but what did he say I  suppose he represented me in strange colours  "You need only to be seen madam" said Mr Bale  to undeceive the most prejudiced yet what he said was not disadvantageous to you unless  added he with a soft smile "you think it a fault to have a tender heart"  "Ah the wretch" interrupted miss Courteney not able to contain her indignation  I see he has been propagating falshoods injurious to my reputation after having poisoned the mind of my aunt with suspicions that were the cause of my losing her affection he is endeavouring to deprive me of every friend I have in the world But this sir is the plain truth he suggested as I have no reason to doubt a preposterous match for me to my aunt I rejected it he found means to persuade my aunt that I listened privately to the addresses of some man who was an improper match for me My aunt in order to prevent my ruin as she supposed insisted upon my accepting the husband she had chosen for me and upon my obstinate refusal was prevailed upon by her chaplain to resolve to confine me in a nunnery abroad I had intelligence of this design and I secretly left my aunt's house to prevent her executing it but I  am so far from having any secret engagement that if I could be sure my aunt would not pursue her scheme of entrapping me in a convent I would instantly return and bind myself by the most solemn oaths never to marry any one whom she does not approve  "You see sir" proceeded miss Courteney  what need I have of your father's assistance he is my only friend and protector through his mediation I might expect to be restored to the good opinion of my aunt  "Well madam" said Mr Bale  if you will write to him I will take care of your letter and if it be ready tomorrow I will attend you myself for it I hope you have no objection to my knowing where you are in my father's absence I shall be proud to act as your guardian though he has had the happiness of knowing you longer yet his concern for your interest cannot be greater than mine Shall I wait on you tomorrow morning miss  added he Henrietta by his manner of urging this request and his frequently casting his eye towards the door as if afraid of some interruption concluding that she detained him from business of more importance rose up immediately and giving him a direction to her lodgings by the name  of Benson told him she would have her letter ready but asked if it would not come safe inclosed to him by the pennypost being unwilling she said to give him the trouble of coming for it  "I beg madam" said he as he took her hand to lead her to the coach  that you will believe I can have no greater pleasure than that of serving you It is necessary that I should have an opportunity of talking to you at leisure that I may know how I can be farther useful to you  Having helped her into the coach be bowed low and retired hastily with such an expression of tender concern on his countenance as any woman less free from vanity than miss Courteney would not have failed to observe but she making no other reflections on his behaviour than that he was more polite than persons usually are who are bred up to business congratulated herself on having sound a friend through whom she could securely correspond with her guardian and receive his advice so that she might now consider herself as being under his immediate care and direction though absent a circumstance that greatly alleviated her uneasiness  Mrs Eccles who had waited dinner for her longer than had been agreed on expressed great  pleasure at seeing her look so chearful  To be sure said she you have heard some unexpected good news I am heartily glad of it Well now I hope you will have more spirits  Henrietta smiled but made no answer for an ingenuous mind can only evade indiscreet curiosity by silence  The cloth was scarce removed when the young lord who had now taken possession of his apartment in Mrs Eccles's house came into the parlour Henrietta immediately rose up to retire to her own chamber when he starting back and standing at the door as if to obstruct her passage  I came said he Mrs Eccles to beg you would make me a dish of coffee but since my presence drives this young lady away I will go up stairs again  "Oh by no means my lord" said Mrs Eccles  I am sure miss Benson will not let you think so You are not going miss are you  added she turning to Henrietta  "I have letters to write" said the young lady "that will take me up the whole afternoon"  "Well" said my lord  I will drink no coffee then for unless you stay miss I shall be persuaded that my coming has driven you away Let me intreat you  pursued he entering and leading her to a chair  to allow  me the pleasure of drinking a dish of coffee with you you will have time enough afterwards to write your letters  Miss Courteney who was willing to avoid the appearance of singularity sat down again tho' with some reluctance telling his lordship that she would not be the means of disappointing him of his coffee but that she must insist upon being permitted to withdraw in half an hour having business of consequence upon her hands  The young nobleman gave little attention to what she said but gazed on her with an earnestness that threw her into some confusion The milliner going out of the room to give orders about the coffee he began in most vehement language to declare a passion for her and called in the assistance of poetry to express his admiration of her charms  Henrietta who in her own character would have treated this manner of address with ridicule and contempt thought it became her in her present circumstances to resent it seriously therefore rising with some signs of indignation she told him that since his lordship thought proper to entertain her with such kind of discourse she would immediately retire My lord who saw she was angry in good earnest was excessively afraid of her leaving him therefore  taking her hand which he forcibly held till he had sealed a vow upon it with his lips that he would not say another word to offend her he brought her back to her seat which upon seeing Mrs Eccles enter she resumed  The conversation then took another turn but Henrietta was too much chagrined to mix in it with any degree of chearfulness besides the party seemed to her to be but ill assorted a nobleman a milliner and a young woman in obscure circumstances Her delicacy was shocked and all the politeness she was mistress of was scarce sufficient to hinder her from shewing how much she was displeased with herself and her company  As soon as the teaequipage was removed she looked at her watch and seeming apprehensive that she should not have time enough to write her letters she withdrew with such precipitation that they had no opportunity to solicit her longer stay  "This is a strange girl" said the young lord throwing himself into his chair from whence he had risen to return the hasty compliment she made at her departure  but divinely handsome who can she be I vow to Gad I believe I shall be in love with her in earnest have you made no discovery yet Mrs Eccles  pursued  he  there is certainly some mystery in the case and a lovemystery it must be for women are not even faithful to their own secrets unless an amour is the business and then they are impenetrable  "Your lordship may be sure" said Mrs Eccles  that I have spared no pains to discover who she is but she is excessively reserved and talks so little that there is no probability of intrapping her yet I think there is one way by which your curiosity may be satisfied Your lordship has seen a gay slighty lady with her of whom she is very fond  "What that ugly creature" said my lord  that fastened upon me in your shop do you mean her is miss Benson fond of that thing  "Oh very fond" replied Mrs Eccles  They were shut up together four hours thi  very morning  "Then depend upon it she is the confident" said his lordship  Oh I guess your scheme you would have me bribe her  "Bribe her my lord" repeated Mrs Eccles  she seems to be a woman of  me fashion I dare say you would affront her extremely by offering her a bribe  "I am very sure" interrupted his lordship  that she will not be able to resist the bribe I shall  offer her I will flatter her my dear Mrs Eccles till I not only become master of all her friend's secrets but even her own but how shall I get an opportunity of talking to her alone  "I will engage" said Mrs Eccles  that it will not be long before she is here again and if your lordship should happen to be below when she comes I fancy you would not find it difficult to detain her a little while from her friend  "Well" said my lord  I leave it to you to manage this interview for me when I know who this miss Benson is I can make my approaches accordingly but when do you expect her down stairs again  Not till suppertime  said Mrs Eccles  she is never weary of being alone  Ah that is a bad sign  said he  I doubt I have a rivalWell I will look in upon you at ten o'clock perhaps I may find her with you  Mrs Eccles assuring him she would engage her till that time if possible He went away humming an operaair but with less vacuity of thought than usual miss Benson being so much in his head that if he had been accustomed to reflexion he would have concluded she was in his heart also and that he was in love with her in earnest  Henrietta in the mean time was employed in writing her letter to Mr Bale to whom she gave a faithful account of all that had happened to her and earnestly intreated his good offices towards effecting a reconciliation between her aunt and her The inconveniencies she saw herself exposed to in her present situation made her so desirous of this happy event that her letter was almost a continued repetition of solicitations for that purpose She begged him in case he did not return to England to write to her aunt and endeavour to soften her assuring him that she pretended to no greater liberty than what an obedient daughter might expect from a parent being resolved to obey her will in every thing provided she might not be compelled to marry the old baronet nor confined in a nunnery with a view to the change of her religion  She expressed her satisfaction in the polite behaviour of his son to her whom she would consider she said as her guardian in his absence and would take no step without his advice and concurrence  She had finished her letter long before the milliner's usual hour of supper but being resolved to go down no more that evening she spread letters and papers upon the table as if she still continued extremely busy Mrs Eccles  upon entering her chamber to know if she was ready for supper found her with the pen still in her hand and was a good deal mortified to hear her say That having dined so late she would not sup that night but would finish her letters before she went to bed  Mrs Eccles did not think proper to press her for her extreme reserve inspired her with a kind of awe that made her cautious of giving her the least disgust and Henrietta taking leave of her at her chamberdoor for the night she went away in great concern for the disappointment his lordship would meet with  It was indeed a very mortifying disappointment to him for his impatience to see miss Courteney had brought him back much sooner than he had intended and Mrs Eccles when she came down stairs found him already in her parlour When he heard the young lady's resolution not to appear again that night he took an unceremonious leave of his complaisant landlady and joined his company again at White's wondering to find himself in so ill an humour on so slight an occasion and that dice and Burgundy were scarce sufficient to call off his thoughts from this coy unknown whom yet he did not despair of gaining  CHAP IX  A very short chapter  HEnrietta upon her coming down next morning to breakfast was informed by Mrs Eccles that a gentleman had been enquiring for her that morning but hearing she was not up had left word that he would call again She did not doubt but it was Mr Bale and was a little confused that his punctuality should so much exceed her's in an affair that immediately concerned her but the truth was the young merchant's impatience to see her had outstripped time and he came much earlier than she had reason to expect him  She retired immediately after breakfast desiring that the gentleman might be shown up stairs when he came again for Mrs Eccles at her request had made a small alteration in her apartment and put her bed in an adjoining closet that she might with more propriety receive a visit in her own room  She was scarce got up stairs when Mr Bale was introduced she apologised for the trouble he had in calling twice and delivering him he  letter recommended it to his care with extreme earnestness assuring him she should be very unhappy till she had an answer She then enquired more particularly concerning the visit Mr Danvers had made him anxious to collect from what he said what impression her flight had made upon her aunt  "I will not flatter you miss" said Mr Bale  Lady Meadows is extremely enraged Mr Danvers mentioned nothing of a design to put you into a convent but owned that your aunt had a very advantageous match in view for you which you rejectedand  "Pray go on sir" said Henrietta observing that he hesitated  "Your aunt will have it" madam pursued he  that your affections are engagedI cannot believe that a young lady of your good sense would make an improper choice I should be very glad to be able to convince my father that nothing of this kind is the case Excuse me miss I am very anxious for your happiness it would give me infinite joy to find that your aunt is mistaken  My aunt has no reason sir for her suspicions  replied Henrietta  but if my affections were engaged why should she think I  had made an improper choice  "Ah miss" eagerly interrupted Mr Bale  "I hope sir" said miss Courteney gravely▪  you will believe me when I declare that my aunt's fears are without foundation it concerns me greatly that your father should not entertain the same idle suspicions and were he here I am sure I could convince him  "Dear miss" interrupted Mr Bale  I cannot suffer you to go on do not imagine that I am not convinced I had doubts but you will excuse them my great concern for your happiness was the causeRely upon me I beg you I will take care my father shall not be prejudiced and till his return I am your guardian  Henrietta upon a little reflection was more pleased than offended at the doubts he so candidly acknowledged in so young a man such plainness and sincerity were far more agreeable than the refinements of compliment and flattery and more suitable to the cha  r in which he desired to be considered and in which she did consider him She thanked him fo  a solicitude which she said was so advantageous to her and to shew him that she wished to give him all imaginable satisfaction with regard to  her conduct she entered into a particular detail of the situation she had been in with her aunt whose views with regard to her she explained she slightly touched upon the character of the chaplain and imputed to his great influence over her aunt the rash and severe resolutions she had taken against her  She was proceeding to justify herself for having left her aunt's house when Mr Bale interrupted her with some emotion  every reasonable person miss said he that knows your motives for taking this step will not only hold you excused but will even applaud you for not sacrificing yourself to riches  "I am sure" said Henrietta  my aunt would hear reason were it not for that invidious chaplain who fills her with suspicions and animates her resentment Oh that Mr Bale was come  "I hope" said the young merchant  that we shall see him shortly but in the mean time miss let me know how I can be useful to you do you like your present lodgings are the people such as you approve Let me know if you have any inclination to remove and I will endeavour to settle you somewhere that will be agreeable to my father I suppose  you would have no objection to lodging with an acquaintance of his and where you will be near him  "No certainly" said miss Courteney  it would be highly agreeable to me  Well miss  said Mr Bale rising  I will wait on you again in a day or two but perhaps you have occasion for money I have brought some with me pray do not put yourself to any inconveniency but draw for what sums you have occasion  "The trifle sir" said Henrietta blushing  that is in your father's hands will not admit of my drawing very largely however I will venture to take up twenty pounds because I have occasion to purchase some trifling things for all my cloaths are at my aunt's and I am in great hopes she will not send them after me that would look indeed  said she sighing  as if I must never expect to return again and I am resolved not to send for them that it may appear I do expect and wish it  Mr Bale upon hearing this pressed her to take forty guineas but she said twenty would do having some money by her He then took leave of her with a promise to see her again soon and left her greatly pleased with his friendly  behaviour and with the prospect of being soon with persons less obnoxious to her than Mrs Eccles  She had scarcely deposited her money in her desk when miss Woodby bolted into the room with her usual robust liveliness Indeed her spirits were particularly exhilarated that day having had the dear delight of conversing an whole hour with a beau who said the civilest things to her imaginable a piece of good fortune she did not often meet with and for which though her vanity did not suffer her to find it out she was wholly indebted to her fair friend the beau being no other than the young lord who lodged in the house with whom she had been engaged in conversation great part of the time that Mr Bale was with miss Courteney And if the reader is curious to know what passed between them he will be fully informed in the next chapter  CHAP X  Which gives the reader a specimen of female friendship  MR Bale had been about half an hour with miss Courteney when miss Woodby came to pay her a morning visit As soon as Mrs Eccles saw a chair set her down at the door she flew up stairs to acquaint her noble lodger with her arrival he instantly followed her down and meeting miss Woodby at the bottom of the stairs affected a joyful surprise at his good fortune in seeing her so unexpectedly again  "The lady you are going to visit" said he  is engaged with company I believe but I am resolved you shall not go away  pursued he taking her hand and leading her into the parlour  I was so charmed with your conversation the first time I saw you that it is not probable I will lose this opportunity of renewing our acquaintance  "Oh your lordship is very obliging" said miss Woodby suffering herself to be led into the parlour while her transport at finding herself  treated with so much gallantry and her passionate desire of pleasing threw her into such ridiculous affectation that every limb and feature was distorted Compliment to which she was very little used acted like strong liquors upon a weak head she became so intoxicated that she hardly knew what she did which joined to a natural aukwardness produced the most absurd blunders in her behaviour so that endeavouring to trip with a lively motion to her seat she overturned a light mahogany table that was in her way and heard the crash of the china that was on it with very little emotion the pleasure of shewing herself to the greatest advantage absolutely engrossing her and so unseasonably did she return his lordship's polite bow when he had seated her in her chair that their foreheads struck against each other with a force like the concussion of two rocks but this accident no more than the former disturbed miss Woodby's enjoyment of her present happiness and wholly insensible to the pain of her forehead she immediately entered into conversation with his lordship asking him with the liveliest air imaginable if he had been at Ranelagh last night never once making the least reflection upon what he had told her of her friend's being engaged with company which  as she knew her situation might well have raised her curiosity  The beau told her he was not there  but you and miss Benson were I suppose  added he  Now your lordship mentions miss Benson  said she without answering his question  pray tell me how you like her is she not very handsome  "Yes" replied my lord  she is handsome but  added he looking full at her  she wants a certain lady's agreeable vivacity  "Oh your servant my lord" said miss Woodby making the application immediately  but really as your lordship observes she wants vivacity there is something heavy and lumpish in her  "Yet she is genteel" said my lord  Oh extremely genteel  cried miss Woodby  but does not your lordship think she is rather too tall being so slender as she is does not that heighth give her a certain aukwardness But I really think she has one of the finest complexions in the world  "Has she not rather too much bloom" said my lord "Why yes" replied miss Woodby  I think her complexion wants delicacy but  no objection can be made to her eyes you must own except that they are rather too large and roll about heavily  "Upon the whole" said my lord  miss Benson is tolerable but I perceive you are extremely fond of her by your partiality  "Oh my lord" said miss Woodby  we are the greatest friends in the world I conceived a violent friendship for her the first moment I saw her You cannot imagine how ardent my friendships are  "That is bad news for your lover" said my lord  for love and friendship the wise say exclude each other but I hope miss Benson makes a proper return to so much affection  Oh we are united in the strongest bands of friendship  said miss Woodby  the dear creature has not a thought that she conceals from me and though I have not been acquainted with her a week she has intrusted me with all her affairs  "Indeed" said my lord  not acquainted a week and so communicative are you sure my dear miss Woodby that this young lady is not a little silly  "I cannot say" replied miss Woodby  that her understanding is the best in the world but she has a very good heart  "Your own is very good I do not doubt" said my lord  which leads you to make so favourable a judgment of another'sHowever as she has laid open her affairs to you you may from the conduct she has avowed collect your opinion of her  "Very true" said miss Woodby  and I do assure your lordship that I cannot help approving of her conduct because her motives were certainly just though the illjudging world may perhaps condemn her for running away from her aunt and from her hiding herself in a lodging assuming another name and such little circumstances may take occasion to censure her yet I am persuaded in my own mind that she is blameless  "Benson is not her name then" said my lord affecting great indifference  Oh no my lord  said miss Woodby  her name i  Courteney But bless me what have  done I hope my lord you will he secret I did not intend to tell your lordship mi  Benson's true name I would not for th  world violate that friendship I have vow  to her  "Depend upon it madam" said my lord  I will be secret as the grave It is of no consequence to me to know her name I shall never think of it again But to be sure the poor girl is to be pitied And so she ran away from her aunt who is her aunt pray  "Her aunt's name is Meadows" said miss Woodby  lady Meadows do you know her  "Not I" said my lord throwing himself into a careless posture and humming an air as if his attention was wholly disengaged when suddenly turning again to miss Woodby with a smile  Why said he should not you and I be as good friends as miss Benson and you are our acquaintance is not of a much shorter date and perhaps commenced nearly in the same manner  "I protest" said miss Woodby  and so it did for I first saw your lordship in Mrs Eccles's shop and I happened to meet miss Benson in a stagecoach about four days ago  "And there your acquaintance began" said my lord  you have improved it well since if she has really been ingenuous enough to let  you into the true state of her affairs I suppose there is a lover in the case  "A lover there certainly is" said miss Woodby  but he was of her aunt's chusing and it is from this lover she fled  "O brave girl" said my lord  but is she not fled to a lover of her own chusing  "No I believe not" said miss Woodby  "Well" said my lord  I fancy she has deceived you and that the gentleman who is with her now is her lover he is a plain sort of man Mrs Eccles says and looks like a merchant  "Oh" said miss Woodby  it is Mr Bale her guardian I suppose  But this is a young man  said my lord"  Then perhaps it is her brother  said miss Woodby  who was abroad with a nobleman and is now returned  "I think I hear him coming down stairs" said my lord  I have a mind to see him as he goes out  Saying this he bowed and ran into the shop leaving miss Woodby a little confused at his abrupt departure and now for the first time she reflected that she had been indiscreet and revealed too much of her friend's situation but being incapable of taking any great interest in the concerns of another thi  Mr Bale asked her pardon for not having consulted her before on that subject but said that by still continuing the name of Benson she would be more secure from the search her aunt might make for her  Alas sir" said miss Courteney  I am afraid my aunt is too much offended to be at any pains to find me outI am more apprehensive of the contrivances of Mr Danvers he no doubt has strong reasons for putting her upon such harsh measures While I was alone and unprotected I thought it necessary to conceal myself since it was not impossible but I might have been forced away but I am sure no such attempt will be made when it is known that I am under my guardian's protection I think therefore this gentlewoman ought to be acquainted with my name I would avoid as much as possible the appearance of mystery I shall never recollect without pain the sad necessity that has reduced me to it  "It will not be prudent" said Mr Bale  to alter our measures now I have called you miss Benson the discovery of your true name will come with more propriety from my father when he has accommodated matters between your aunt and you we may expect a letter  from him in a day or two in which he will probably fix the time of his return In the mean while I hope you will find yourself agreeably situated here I have agreed for your board and lodging  "At a moderate price I hope" said miss Courteney  my circumstances do not entitle me to great expence  I have taken care of that  said Mr Bale Mrs Willis coming in that moment he recommended miss Courteney to her care promising when he heard from his father to come immediately with the news He then took his leave and Mrs Willis conducted her fair lodger to another parlour where the cloth was laid for dinner and introduced two pretty children to her a boy and a girl with whom the young lady was extremely pleased  There was in the countenance of this woman so much sweetness and complacency and such an unaffected politeness in her behaviour that Henrietta found herself insensibly disposed to like her and was pleased to hear her  ll naturally into an account of herself with a frankness and simplicity that denoted the goodness of her heart▪  From what she said miss Courteney col+lected that she had made a marriage of choic  rather than of prudence and that industry ha  supplied the place of fortune She found she was under great obligations to the elder Mr Bale who had settled her husband in an advantageous way at Leghorn where he acted as his factor and had enabled her to furnish that large house in a very genteel manner for the reception of such merchants as came from abroad and were by him recommended to lodge with her Her extreme tenderness for her husband which had hurried her to Leghorn upon hearing that he was ill that she might have the satisfaction of attending him herself and her anxiety for her children which brought her back as soon as he was recovered that she might reassume her care of them were qualities which won her the esteem of miss Courteney She marked with what becoming reserve she slightly touched upon her family and connections which were very genteel and by which Henrietta accounted for the easy politeness of her manners and behaviour so seldom found in persons of her rank  The young lady then turned the discourse upon her guardian's son whose character she was desirous of being acquainted with Mrs Willis told her that he was a sober diligent young man and though the heir of immense riches yet applied himself to business with as much industry as if he had had his fortune to  make that he had for several years transacted his father's business in Holland from whence he was but lately returned and that he traded largely for himself  Before I went to Leghorn added she there was some talk of his being to be married to the daughter of a very rich citizen but since my return which was about a week ago I have heard nothing of it not having seen Mr Bale till the day that he came to tell me I should be so happy as to have you madam for my lodger  Miss Courteney having passed this day more agreeably than she had done any since she had left her aunt was at night conducted by Mrs Willis to a genteel apartment consisting of a bedchamber and dressingroom She dismissed the maid whom Mrs Willis ordered to attend and undress her and being greatly fatigued for want of rest the preceding night lost all  er cares her anxieties and resentments in the sweet oblivion of a calm and uninterrupted sleep  CHAP XIII  The history still advances  HEnrietta though an early riser and though she rose next morning earlier than usual yet found upon her going down Mrs Willis had waited breakfast for her some time  As soon as the teaequipage was removed she retired to leave Mrs Willis at liberty to go about her domestick affairs and when alone was again assaulted with all those cruel reflections which had almost incessantly filled her mind since her flight from her aunt Among these miss Woodby's treachery suggested none of the least painful she was ashamed of her credulity of her illplaced confidence indignation for the shocking treatment she had met with from her succeeded She was upon the point of sitting down to write to her and to express the deepest resentment of her malice and treachery when recollecting the extreme levity of that young woman's temper her ridiculous affectation her folly and insensibility she thought it would ill become her to make serious remonstrances to one who only merited contempt  that by taking no further notice of her that contempt would be best expressed and her own consciousness of the part she had acted would account for it  While she was thus ruminating Mrs Willis's maid introduced two porters bringing in a large trunk to her apartment They delivered her the key sealed up and a letter from Mr Bale in which he informed her he would wait on her that afternoon  She opened the trunk trembling it contained all her cloaths linen and all the trinkets her aunt had given her She searched eagerly in it to see if there was a letter for her but finding none she threw herself into a chair and burst into a flood of tears  While her aunt retained her cloaths she had formed a feeble hope that she was anxious for her return and would facilitate it by assuring Mr Bale that she would no more press her to the hated marriage nor think of con  ining her in a convent but now what could she conclude but that she had abandoned her for ever and that a reconciliation was not to be expected The most gloomy prospects offered themselves to her view poverty dependence neglect but what was worse than all the loss perhaps of reputation How should she be able to excuse  herself to the world for her late action the world which judges actions only by their success and when it beheld her unhappy and reduced to indigence would not fail to conclude her guilty  In these melancholy apprehensions did she wear away the hours till summoned to dinner by Mrs Willis who with tender concern perceived that she was afflicted but would not discover that she perceived it and used her utmost endeavours to amuse her yet without any apparent solicitude lest it should alarm her sensibility with a fear that her uneasiness was observed  Mr Bale came according to his promise in the afternoon his arrival gave almost as much satisfaction to Mrs Willis as to her fair anxious lodger from a hope that it would produce some comfort to her The young merchant instantly discovered that Henrietta had been weeping and as soon as Mrs Willis withdrew he tenderly approached her and taking her hand asked her if any thing new had happened to give her disturbance Henrietta replied with a hasty question  Have you any message for me from my aunt sir  "I cannot say I have a message for you miss" answered Mr Bale  your aunt has indeed  wrote to me  "May I not see her letter" asked miss Courteney again eagerly  To be sure  said he taking it out of his pocket and presenting it to her  I wish it was conceived in more favourable terms  Miss Courtency read it trembling and found it as follows  SIR  I HAVE given directions that every thing which belongs to that unhappy girl my niece should be sent to you that if you know where she is they may be conveyed to her She has by her scandalously running away from me ruined her own character and brought aspersions upon mine since even those who condemn her most will likewise blame me as if I had acted unkindly towards her  May the loss of my affection be the least of her misfortunes though the worst that can possibly happen are likely to be the punishment of her ingratitude and folly  Henrietta returned the letter to Mr Bale with a sigh  I have indeed said she irrecoverably lost her affection but sir it is fit my aunt should know where I am and that I solicited your protection as soon as I could This will  preserve me from some of those unfavourable suspicions which she mentions so severely I will write to her instantly  "Oh no by no means" said Mr Bale  I think it will be best for me to make a visit to lady Meadows and tell her that you are under my care and that I have placed you here  "And will you take the trouble to go to Windsor sir" said miss Courtency extremely delighted with this expedient  I would go any where  said Mr Bale  to serve you Pray make yourself easy  "I shall be easier" said miss Courteney  when my aunt knows that this scandalous runaway is under proper protection and is accountable for all her actions to your father Perhaps she may relent when she is convinced I am not so indiscreet as she imagined and that I had no other motive for leaving her but the fear of being confined in a convent If you find my aunt absolutely resolved not to be reconciled to me I must then consider how to dispose of myself in a way more suitable to my circumstances  "Remember miss" said Mr Bale with some emotion  that you are under my care I hope you will take no resolutions without acquainting me  "No certainly" replied Henrietta  but sir I have no fortune I am lodged attended and treated as if I had a very considerable one This expence I shall not be willing to support a great while longer it will break in too much upon that trifling sum which was put into your father's hands for my brother's use as well as mine Heaven knows said she sighing whether he is alive if he is he will probably need it if he is not it will go but a very little way in supporting me in the manner in which I now live  While Henrietta was speaking in this manner Mr Bale seemed ready to interrupt her several times but checked himself as if upon better recollection when she was silent he walked about the room musing then suddenly turning towards her  These considerations miss said he ought at least to be postponed till my father's return and I think you may rely upon his prudence he will certainly take care that your expences shall not exceed your income in placing you here I have done what I thought would be agreeable to him  Henrietta observing that he was in some confusion was concerned that she had spoke so freely being apprehensive that he understood what she had said as a distrust of his prudence She therefore  told him that if he found her aunt implacable she would be extremely well satisfied to continue with Mrs Willis as long as Mr Bale should think it necessary  This assurance satisfied the young merchant who left her with a promise to see lady Meadows the next day and to wait on her as soon as possible with an account of the success of his visit  She passed this interval in a state of anxiety and suspence that doubled every hour As soon as she saw Mr Bale again she endeavoured to read in his countenance before he spoke the news he had brought her  "Well miss said he I have seen your aunt" He paused and Henrietta in a saltering accent begged him to tell her in one word whether he had succeeded or not  Indeed I have not said he lady Meadows seems resolved never to forgive you for running away from her but don't despair my father may have more weight with her  It is at least some comfort said she that she knows I am under your protection  I have a letter from my father  said Mr Bale  he has got the gout in his right hand he dictated it to one of his clerks and therefore speaks with reserve of you He desires me to tell you that he hopes to be in London in  three weeks at farthest when he will use his utmost endeavours to reconcile you to your aunt and in the mean time recommends you most affectionately to my care  This account of her guardian's kind concern for her gave some relief to the depressed spirits of miss Courteney who although she had not flattered herself with any hope from the young merchant's mediation with her aunt was as much shocked at the confirmation of her continued displeasure as if she had not expected it However she expressed a grateful sense of his services and disposed herself to wait with patience for the arrival of Mr Bale who alone could d  +termine her destiny  CHAP XIV  Containing several mysterious circumstances  HEnrietta had been about a fortnight in the house of Mrs Willis whose good sense and polite behaviour had entirely won her esteem when on a sudden she became reserved and thoughtful and often failed in those little attentions which mark respect and an extreme willingness to oblige She who had avoided the least appearance of curiosity to know more of her affairs than what she pleased to disclose now asked questions with an inquisitive air and seemed to seek for occasions of collecting a fuller knowledge of her from her conversation  Henrietta had insisted upon her being made acquainted with her true name and circumstances from the time that Mr Bale had acknowledged to her aunt that she was under his care which had produced no other alteration in Mrs Willis than rather an increase of respect towards her which she conceived due to her birth  The young lady whose extreme sensibility was not the least of her misfortunes observed her  increasing coldness and suffered great uneasiness She had willingly indulged a tenderness and esteem for her and was concerned to find from her altered behaviour that either she had failed in her endeavours to acquire the friendship of Mrs Willis or that the woman whom she had conceived so good an opinion of was in reality not deserving of hers  However she was determined not to let Mr Bale perceive that she was dissatisfied with her behaviour and she continued to live with her in the same easy manner as formerly notwithstanding the coldness and constraint with which she was now treated  Mr Bale scarce ever failed to call and see her once a day but one day he returned about an hour after he had been with her and told her he had just received letters from his father in which he acquainted him that Mrs Willis would in a few days have several foreign merchants in her house whom he had recommended to lodge with her and that his stay in Holland being protracted for some time longer he thought it would not be proper for miss Courteney to reside with Mrs Willis till his return as her house would be full of men  "My father" added Mr Bale  desires me to ask you miss whether you have any objection  to go into the country for a few weeks He has a distant relation a widow who lives at Hampstead with whom he says he will be glad to find you at his return he begs you will excuse his not writing to you having the gout still in his hand and desires me to assure you of his tenderest concern for your welfare  A week before Henrietta would have thought it a misfortune to have left Mrs Willis to go into any other lodging but she was so piqued by her behaviour that she heard this news without any uneasiness and told Mr Bale she would implicitly follow her guardian's directions  He said he would conduct her to his cousin's himself and took leave of her after he had desired her to be ready for her little journey the next day  Mrs Willis came up to her apartment soon after Mr Bale went away  I hear I am soon to lose you miss  said she entering "Yes" replied miss Courteney cooly  such is my guardian's pleasure but  added she smiling  you will not miss me you will have other company  "Other company" repeated Mrs Willis  "Mr Bale tells me" said miss Courteney  that your house will be full soon some gentlemen  recommended by his father will be here  "It is strange" said Mrs Willis  that I should know nothing of it have you had a letter from your guardian miss  "No" replied miss Courteney  but his son has heard from himBut  pursued she after a little pause  it is strange as you say that you should not know you are to have new lodgers  Mrs Willis looked at her attentively as she spoke these words "May I ask you miss" said she "the cause of your sudden removal"  "I know of none" replied miss Courteney  but that my guardian thinks it will not be proper for me to stay among so many gentlemen as will shortly be your lodgers  I wish there had been a better reason than that  said Mrs Willis  for I am very sure I am to have no lodgers recommended by the elder Mr Bale otherwise I should have known it  "Has not his son told you so" asked miss Courteney in great confusion of thought  "He told me nothing" replied Mrs Willis "but that you are to leave me tomorrow"  "Lord bless me" cried the young lady in great emotion "what can this mean"  "Suffer me" said Mrs Willis looking on her with tenderness and concern  to ask you a few questions when you know my motives I am sure you will not think that it is an impertinent curiosity which makes me take this liberty but my anxiety for you  "Dear madam" interrupted miss Courteney  ask me what you please you alarm me excessively  "I would not alarm you" said Mrs Willis  but I will own to you that I have fears nay more that I have had doubts but I see I have been to blame with regard to the latter has Mr Bale shewn you his father's letters miss  "Shewn them to me" repeated Henrietta  nobut suredear Mrs Willis explain yourselfI am ready to sink with the apprehensions you have raised in my mind  "Compose yourself my dear" said Mrs Willis drawing her chair nearer to her and taking her hand tenderly  I mean you well be assured I do and now I will tell you all that has been upon my mind for several days past Never did I imagine that I should entertain unfavourable suspicions of the son of my benefactor but indeed my dear miss  I am afraid he has not acted ingenuously by you  That moment a loud knocking at the door interrupted Mrs Willis She started from her chair "Who can this be" said she in some surprise "I will go and see" She ran hastily out of the room but returning again instantly "Possibly" said she  it may be Mr Bale remember miss that it is my advice to you not to leave my house if he should desire you at least till you have heard what I have to say  She uttered these words with extreme earnestness and concern and went immediately down stairs leaving Henrietta in an agony of doubt anxiety and astonishment  Her surprise kept her motionless in her chair till she was roused by the voice of a woman upon the stairs that led to her apartment whom she heard say with great haughtiness of accent  No there is no occasion for that ceremony I shall go in without introduction I assure you  She suddenly started from her chair and was going towards the door when she saw it  ung open with some violence and a lady of a  disagreeable figure but richly dressed and in the utmost extremity of the fashion appear at the entrance  Miss Courteney recovering a little from her surprise looked at the lady in order to recollect whether she had ever seen her before but being wholly unacquainted with her features and observing that she stood still and gazed at her without speaking she concluded the visit could not be designed for her  "I fancy madam" said she approaching her  you are mistaken I am not the person you seek  "No  madam  " returned the lady with an "emphasis "I am not mistaken" then throwing herself haughtily into a chair  I shall not ask your leave  said she with a malignant smile  to sit down in this apartment I may take that liberty with what belongs to Mr BaleDo you know me pray  madam  "Not I truly" replied miss Courteney indignation at this insolent treatment having banished her former terror and surprise and seating herself with a careless air just opposite to her  Pray let me know what is your business with me  said she  "Port creature" said the stranger affecting contempt while her lips quivered with rage and her whole frame seemed convulsed with the violence of her emotions  What you would  have me understand you to be a woman of fortune would you notUpon my word  said she looking round her  this is a very handsome apartment Your dressingroom forsooth You have your forms no doubt and receive company in your dressingroom in a morning A very genteel dishabi  too and your face varnished over so nicely Who would not conclude that white and re  to be natural  "You are come here to insult me I find" said Henrietta her fine face glowing with indignation  I cannot imagine what cause I have given you for this strange rudeness I never as I can remember ever saw you before and insist upon your quitting my apartment You can have no business with me I am sure  "Indeed but I have minx" said the stranger with the pale rage of a fury  and my business is to turn you out of this apartment my fortune shall not be wasted in supporting such wretches  "Your fortune" cried miss Courteney in astonishment  What have I to do with  or your fortuneWho are you  This moment Mrs Willis entered the room "Excuse me ladies" said she  I heard high words between you  "Ladies" interrupted the stranger  how dare you woman join me with such a creatureWhat business have you to intrude  "Madam" replied Mrs Willis  I came to inform this young lady my boarder who you are she does not know youMiss this is young Mr Bale's lady  "What" cried Henrietta in the utmost astonishment "is Mr Bale married"  "Ohyou are surprised then" said the lady with a sneer  disappointed too perhaps You had the confidence I suppose to think he would have married you one of these daysTell me you wicked thing did he ever give you such hopesOh I could tear his eyes out  said she rising and walking about the room like one frantick while the enormous length of her negligee swept the room like the train of a tragedyqueen  A wretch to use me thus me who has brought him such a fortune But I'll be revenged he shall never have a quiet moment I'll make him know what it is to slight a woman of virtue  All this time Henrietta continued silent rooted in her chair and with difficulty restrained the anguish of her heart from rising to her eyes lest this outrageous woman of virtue should exult in her distress yet she saw that she was betrayed that Mr Bale had acted weakly if not basely▪ her reputation was ruined yet she would not stoop so low as to enter into any justification of herself to a woman who had treated her so cruelly upon a bare suspicion The pride of affronted virtue came to her aid against that torrent of overwhelming grief which had for some moments absorbed all her faculties she rose from her chair and approaching Mrs Bale  "The error you are in" said she  would have moved my compassion had you treated me with less insolence I scorn to undeceive youGo learn from your husband who I am and blush if you can for the injurious language you have given a person as much your superior by birth as in that virtue perhaps of which you boast and which has not withheld you from such indecent transports of jealousy as it would become a virtuous woman to suppress  The superiority with which she spoke the dignity of her air and manner struck her meansouled adversary with such awe that she continued  silent for some moments with her haggard looks fixed on her Envy at the view of so lovely a form added new stings to her rage and jealousy At length she poured forth a torrent of reproaches with such eagernese of malice that her words were scarce intelligible  "I am not used to scolding" said miss Courteney calmly retiring towards her bedchamber  and you Mrs Bale seem to be an excellent scold  The lady provoked at this appellation employed the coarsest language imaginable to express her resentment of the injury but miss Courteney took shelter in her bedchamber the door of which she doublelocked  "Insolent trollop" said Mrs Bale raising her voice that she might hear her  call me scold I scorn your words you saucy impudent audacious hussy I never could scold in my lifeno you dirty pussI am a woman of breeding I am none of your beggarly quality I had forty thousand pounds to my portion you proud paultry minxScold call me a scold  "Pray madam compose yourself" said Mrs Willis  and do me the favour to walk down into my parlourHere is some mistake  I am pretty certain you have i  d this young lady by your suspicions  "Young lady" interrupted Mrs Bale  What makes her a ladyA fine world it is nowadays when beggars are called ladies I would fain know what fortune she has to put her upon a footing with ladies  "I know nothing of her fortune madam" said Mrs Willis  "Fortune poor wretch" said Mrs Bale  a few paultry hundredsSuch ladies▪ Suppose her grandfather was an earl has she a fortune answer me that  "I don't know really" replied Mrs Willis "Well then" said Mrs Bale  why do you give her a title she has no right to But why do I talk to you vile wretch you are my husband's confident  This thought renewed all her rage and she loaded Mrs Willis with such shocking in  tives that the poor woman could not refrain from tears  "Your husband's father madam" said she  has been a generous benefactor to me I consider that and will be patient under you  abuse  The word  abuse  was such a charge upon th  lady's want of breeding that she called M  Willis a hundred saucy jades for daring to say that she was capable of abusing any body and having almost exhausted her spirits with the violence of her passions and finding that Mrs Willis sat silent and took no further notice of what she said she flounced out of the room declaring that her fatherinlaw should know that she acted as procuress for his son and that she should return to her rags and poverty again  Mrs Willis thought her behaviour dispensed with her from treating her with that respect which she would have otherwise paid to Mr Bale's daughterinlaw and therefore did not offer to wait on her down stairs but rung the bell for somebody to attend her and locking the door after her she tapped gently at miss Courteney's chamberdoor telling her that Mrs Bale was gone  Who is this fury" said the young lady as she came out  You have been treated very ill by her Mrs Willis I am sorry for it  And I am sorry for what you have suffered my dear miss  replied Mrs Willis  but Mr Bale is to blame for it all I am now sure you are entirely innocent  "Innocent" repeated miss Courteney with a sigh  How low am I fallen when that  could ever be doubted But Mrs Willis you knew it seems that Mr Bale was married I am surprised you never mentioned his wife to me  "And are you not surprised miss" said Mr Willis  that Mr Bale never mentioned he  to you  "To be sure that was very strange" repiled Henrietta "what could he mean by it"  "Ah miss" said Mrs Willis  a very little reflection on Mr Bale's behaviour might have informed you that he was in love with you  "In love with me" cried Henrietta blushing with shame and resentment  "Yes" said Mrs Willis  in love with you if that can be called love which seeks the ruin of its object I saw it in his looks his words cautious as they were his whole behaviour shewed it but too plainly  "And this man married too" cried Henrietta lifting up her eyes  To what have  by one rash step reduced myself But still Mrs Willis my first difficulty  why did you avoid speaking of his wife to me  "Hear me my dear with patience" interrupted Mrs Willis  I shall be very f  e but my plainness ought not to offend you s  e  it is a mark of my sincerity  Mrs Willis paused here a moment and then proceeded as will be sound in the following chapter  CHAP XV  In which those circumstances are partly explained  YOU may remember I told you soon after you came here that before I went to Leghorn I heard Mr Bale was courting the daughter of a rich citizen I had been returned but three or four days when he came to me to know if I could accommodate a young lady a ward of his father's with lodging and board to which I readily consented  It is no flattery miss to tell you that when I saw you I was charmed with your person and behaviour your beauty and Mr Bale's extreme assiduity made it seem highly probable that he loved you I set myself to examine his behaviour and the observations I made on it confirmed my suspicions I had then heard nothing of his being married having upon my return been so taken up with  my domestick affairs that I had no leisure to make or receive visits from which I could receive any information concerning what had happened in my absence  I was a little surprised to find that you had been introduced to me under a feigned name and that you were not called Benson but Courteney However I made no reflections upon that circumstance till about t  d  s afterwards I accidentally heard that Mr Bale had been married two months then it was that in my astonishment at his so contiously avoiding any mention of his wife I was led to reflect upon what you yourself had informed me of your situation your flight from your friends Mr Bale's apparent tenderness for you awakened suspicions I own it disadvantageous to you  I waited impatiently for the ho  of Mr Bale's visiting you and the moment I saw him wished him joy on his marriage expressing my surprise that I should not have heard of that event from himself He coloured and seemed in great confusion and after a little pause Have you said any thing of it to miss Courteney said he  "I replied that I had heard the news but an "hour before and had not seen you since  You will oblige me said he if you will not mention it to her I stared My wife continued he is the most unreasonable woman in the world she has taken it into her head to be horribly jealous of me though we have been married so short a time It was a match and he sighed of my father's making but I assure you I am very unhappy  I am sorry for it sir interrupted I but what reasons have you for concealing from miss Courteney that you are married  It is a sad thing Mrs Willis said he when a man is not master in his own family I hope that is not your case sir answered I Indeed but it is he replied Miss Courteney you know is agreeable Oh very agreeable said I My wife is of such an unaccountable humour resumed he that I durst not offer miss Courteney though my father is her guardian an asylum in my house till her relations were reconciled to her lest I should be teazed with jealousy and suspicions  I am persuaded sir said I that miss Courteney has too much good sense to take  iss that you did not invite her to your house as things were circumstanced She has more reason to be displeased at your concealing your marriage from her which every body knows and which she would soon know if she lived less retired  Let me intreat you Mrs Willis said he not to mention it to miss Courteney I would not upon any account that she should know I am married yet could not offer her an apartment in my house  Indeed sir said I smiling you make  matter of more consequence than you need to do miss Courteney will not consider it as any slight to her  She must either think herself slighted resumed he with quickness by my not invis  her or she will divine the reason which would be worse for in that case her delicacy is so extreme that she would never allow me to see her  Ah thought I is it so He perceived he had almost betrayed himself and changed the discourse asking me many questions about my husband whose diligence and fidelity he highly extolled dropping hints of designs in his savour  and indeed it is in his power to be of great service to him  "But I had no satisfaction" pursued Mrs Willis  in what he said for to my apprehension it appeared as if he sought to bribe me into a concurrence with his designs whatever they were Therefore I sat silent and I believe discovered by my looks that I did not like his proceedings for he rose up and with an air of some resentment said  That his father would be in town in a few days and would then dispose of you properly and that in the mean time he must insist upon my being silent with regard to his marriage since it would throw him into great confusion if you knew it and added that he thought he might reasonably expect this instance of my complaisance  I told him that I was very glad to hear his father would be in town so soon and would take the young lady under his own care that since he desired it I would not be the first to acquaint you with his marriage I owned his reasons appeared to me very whimsical but that it was not my business to be impertinently curious and that I should concern myself no farther about it  He seemed pleased with this indifference and went up stairs to see you I had already taken my resolution my dear miss Courteney which was to write to his father and acquaint him with the whole transaction I was willing to leave the young gentleman in a false security that he might not suspect my design and take measures to render it useless and not being sure how far even you might be trusted for my suspicions of you though weakened were not yet removed I thought it best to say nothing that could alarm you till I had received the old gentleman's advice how to act but my measures were broke by Mr Bale's resolving to take you from my house  He came into the parlour to me today before you saw him and told me that he had directions from his father to send you into the country because he did not expect to return for some time yet and he did not approve of your residing in London till he came  You may easily imagine miss that I was not satisfied with the cause he assigned for this sudden resolution I was now alarmed for you and judged it necessary to acquaint you immediately with Mr Bale's being married that  you might not fall ignorantly into his snares I began with asking you questions to which the openness and simplicity of your answers convinced me that you were imposed upon greatly by Mr Bale I was going to explain myself clearly when Mrs Bale's arrival interrupted me You know with what earnestness I intreated you not to leave my house I was apprehensive that he was come to hurry you away and I trembled for the danger to which you were exposed  When I left you I met Mrs Bale upon the stairs and not knowing her I asked who it was she desired to see The young woman that lodges with you said she in a tone of voice that surprised me I told her I would go and acquaint you that there was a lady wanted to speak to you but she rushed by me saying there is no need of that ceremony I shall introduce myself  Her behaviour recalling to my mind what Mr Bale had said of his wife's jealousy I suspected this was the lady and to be assured I enquired of a servant who attended her who she was The moment I knew it was really her I flew up stairs being full of concern for you for I saw a storm in her  countenance and dreaded the consequence The poor young man is indeed plagued with a jealous wife and in that particular he told the truth But my dear miss I see plainly that the mystery he has made of his connexions with you has rouzed her suspicions  It is all an incomprehensible mystery to me  said Henrietta sighing  Mr Bale has certainly deceived me for what purposes I know not but I know that I will never see him again but in the presence of his father to have this dark affair cleared up  But my dear Mrs Willis how shall I express what my heart feels for you who have shewn so tender a regard for my honour and quiet How miserable might I have been had you been less goodI am sure I may rely upon your prudence Advise me then what to do you know my story you see my present situation I have no friend no protector  "My dear miss" interrupted Mrs Willis  there is but one thing for you to do and that is to return to your aunt  "How can I appear before her" said Henrietta  after having so greatly disobliged her  by my flight a flight which has had such disgraceful consequences Besides do not the same motives that obliged me to leave her still subsist and are they not equally strong against my returning  "I would not pain you my dear miss" said Mrs Willis  with the recollection of a past error were it not to make it useful to you in your present circumstances Warned as you were of your aunt's designs it was impossible to carry them into execution without your concurrence your flight therefore was not necessary and if not necessary surely it was highly imprudent and in my opinion can only be repaired by a voluntary return Need I tell a young lady of your delicacy that imputations however unjust fully if they do not stain a character Do you think this woman's frantic jealousy will be silent how can you otherwise prove the falshood of her assertions than by returning to your aunt and making yourself accountable to her for all your actions Nothing can be more unfortunate for youth and beauty than to be left to its own guidance and discretion The world seldom attributes too much prudence to youth however regular our conduct may be in that  gay time of life it is supposed to be owing to the care and attention of our parents or relations rather than to our own circumspection Can a young woman who voluntarily sets herself free from that restraint hope to escape unfavourable censures when those who owe it to chance only that they are not subjected to any control suffer perhaps in the opinion of the world because they are possessed of a liberty which they may make an improper use of  You see my dear to what inconveniencies you have been exposed these are the necessary consequences of your unprotected state there is no doubt but you would repel every attempt to the prejudice of your honour but does not modesty if not virtue suffer by such attempts and can you acquit yourself of imprudence when you reflect that you have thrown yourself into a situation which renders you liable to them  "It was indeed" said Henrietta who by her blushes and confusion acknowledged the strength of her reasons  imprudence to throw myself into this situation but it would be guilt to continue in it Oh that I had had such a friend as you to advise with at Windsor I  should never have taken a step which I blush to think of now I will return to my aunt Mrs Willis I will throw myself upon her mercy and if I must be made a sacrifice of  Indeed my dear interrupted Mrs Willis these fears are groundless you cannot possibly be married against your consent and you have it always in your power to refuse As for the convent you cannot be cheated into it that is certain since you know she had such a design and may guard against it  But suppose said miss Courteney that she should not receive me again Mr Bale found her inexorable  "Ah my dear" replied Mrs Willis shaking her head  Mr Bale was not a fit person to be trusted with such a negociation but however that may be I am sure when your aunt knows in what manner he has acted and the reasons you have to distrust him she will think it necessary to take you out of his hands Your return to her will remove her suspicions against you and convince her that it was from a sudden impulse of fear only that you left her and that you had no desire of  disposing of yourself contrary to her inclinations  But I have one savour to beg of you said miss Courteney and that is that you will go along with me to my aunt resentment may shut her ears to all that I can say to her but I think she cannot resist your pleas urged with that good sense you possess in so high a degree  Doubt not my dear said Mrs Willis but I am ready to do you any service in my power  "What hinders us then from going directly" cried Henrietta eagerly  we can get a postchaise and  The day is too far advanced replied Mrs Willis we will if you please set out early tomorrow morning I will take care to have a postchaise in readiness in the mean time you may depend upon being secure from any disagreeable visits here neither Mr Bale nor his fury of a wife shall see you unless you desire they should  Notwithstanding the treatment she gave me said miss Courteney I would rather see her than him but you may well imagine Mrs Willis that I do not wish to see either of them  Make yourself easy my dear said Mrs Willis you shall meet with no insult of any kind in my house  Henrietta embraced her with tears of gratitude which the good woman returned with a parental tenderness and then left her to give the necessary directions for their little journey the next day  END of VOL I
