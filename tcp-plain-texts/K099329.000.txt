 TWO DITHYRAMBIC ODES  I ON ENTHUSIASM  II TO LAUGHTER  BY THE AUTHOR OF RIMES  Numerisque fertur  Lege solutis  HOR  LONDON PRINTED FOR C DILLY  MDCCLXXXII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE reader may perhaps think that there was no oc∣casion to give a new title to these Odes the former denomination of Irregular being sufficient But ever since the days of Cowley Irregular Odes have had more pretensions to the irregularity of chaos than to that of nature The Author has therefore restored their an∣cient name When a title becomes a badge of indignity it is surely proper to refuse it Yet titles are neither here nor there  The Italians who alone of all modern nations feel what real poetry what real painting what real music are have many productions of high same under this title The flames would have received the following pieces had not the Author known that they have more merit than many productions which have the honour to attain the praise of those who know nothing But he pretends not to the exquisite spirit of Poliziano  DITHYRAMBIC ODE I ON ENTHUSIASM  SHADES of poets blest  That oft my dreams  With rapturous gleams  Of glory have possest  Appear appear appear  If yet the mortal vow ye hear  O hither from your mansions bright  O hither bend your speedy flight  While light and odours float around  And harps unseen empyreal airs resound  Say from what living spring  Descends the flood of fame  That bears your sacred strains along  The vales and echoing mountains o'er  Of each admiring shore  While empires all prolong  In every varied speech the wonders of your song  And languages that have as yet no name  Their tributary rills shall bring  To swell the lordly stream  Say from what mighty cause  Is heard the high applause  That you the distant climes  That you the distant times  With adoration have confest  Gods of the human breast  And moved with filial awe  Have bent their sense and feeling to your law  And noblest homage brought  The homage of the thought  Enthusiasm was that spring  Enthusiasm was the cause  Why heard that high applause  Enthusiasm race divine did all those honours bring  Ye chief of former days whose daring vows addressed  Nature ere hid in Fashion's speckled vest  When she great goddess in her prime  Her virgin fancies played at will  Fancies surpassing mortal skill  And with her sons held colloquy sublime  By hallowed fount with verdant gloom o'ergrown  Or in the whispering vale or desert mountain lone  While forms of heaven not unseen  With fairy footsteps paced the green  And in mystic notes conveyed  Things secret from the human thought or eye  Full oft such is thy will O Poesy  Where vulgar minds discern nought save the shade  The wise the sun descry  Qualor di Pindo le Reine accolgo  Il fortunato mi o lieto soggiorno  S'empie di luce intorno  Che splende ai saggi e si fa nebbia al volgo  Guidi    For oft the sun will shroud  His flames behind a cloud  And Sages ye whose eloquence divine  Would with a golden chain  The hearer's soul restrain  And bear to every Passion's distant shrine  Whose thunder shook the throne  Of each barbaric lord  Tho by deluded myriads prone  Of trembling slaves adored  Whose lucid art of life illumed the plan  And heavenly Wisdom brought to dwell with man  Without thy fierce controul  Enthusiasm soul of the rapt soul  Picture in vain bids her creation rise  Music in vain her vocal skill applies  In night the fair creation lies  The bidden airs sleep in the sullen shell  Till thou their birth impell  At thy command the glowing forms appear  At thy command the strains enchant the ear  Thy praise may every art  And science fair impart  For all to thee their richest lustre owe  From thee all attributes of mind  That to gods exalt mankind  All deeds immortal flow  Hark hark The sounds of conflict rise  What light divine illumes that sacred field  Leonidas where thy devoted few  Their fatal falchions drew  And of their carcases composed a shield  Their country to protect from dastard enemies  In Freedom's holy hand  Their radiant banner flew  Before the godlike band  Her rousing trump Enthusiasm blew  When bold Colombo dared the watery realm  A world unknown to find  Enthusiasm held the helm  And with fresh vigor stored his ardent mind  Till rose the wished shore  Where empires lost to fame before  Where golden cities shone  And shrines of other sacred powers  Groves of new pomp and meads of other flowers  And other music from the copse was blown  Oh goddess if one happy clime  Remains yet secret from the Muse  Thy blessed influence diffuse  O lend thy votary thy aid sublime  By art's just compass and by fancy's gate  There to direct his daring sail  And treasures bring unknown in former time  DITHYRAMBIC ODE II To LAUGHTER  THE violet that in the lonely stream  Beholds her humble head  Tho saved from icy breeze or sultry beam  Her fragrant leaves must shed  Along the stream that fed  Her life the fragrant leaves are tost  Till in the ruthless ocean lost  Meet emblem of man's fading joy  That tho saved from all annoy  On time's inevitable wave  Still hastens to the grave  To taste the fragrance of the flower  And not the flower destroy  Is wisdom Haste the fleeting hour  Ye race of Mirth employ  Thou Laughter lead the festal band  Wit and Humour hand in hand  Sports that dance and Sports that sing  Love and Rapture with thee bring  Now when merry Spring reposes  On her bed of balmy roses  In fantastic measures revel  All along the flowery level  Sweet melody pervades the luminous air  E una melodia dolce correva  Per l'aer luminoso  Dante Purg    The jocund tribes appear  My suppliant thy wish declare  Lo I wait to hear thy prayer  While some tho wise in mental gloom  Their melancholy hours entomb  And from terror of the morrow  Waste the given day in sorrow  Attend propitious Power my claim  Do thou invading cares repell  With thee dear goddess let me dwell  And laugh at life's amusing game  THE END
