modern Germany is not so much the history of any particular kingdom as of a number of petty independent states sometimes at war and sometimes in alliance with one another Of these different states therefore we shall now give an account with as much brevity as is consistent with perspicuity and we shall begin our narrative at that period where real and authentic history commences for as to the more early that is the fabulous times of the Grecian republics these belong to mythology rather than to history  Sicyon then is said to have been the first kingdom that was established in Greece The beginning of it is placed by historians in the year of the world one thousand nine hundred and fifteen before Christ two thousand eightynine and before the first Olympiad one thousand three hundred and thirteen Its first king was Aegialeus It is said to have lasted a thousand years  A M  The kingdom of Argos in Peloponnesus began a thousand and eighty years before the first Olympiad in the time of Abraham The first king was Inachus  This was succeeded by the kingdom of Mycenae to which place the seat of government was transferred from Argos by Perseus the grandson of Acrisius the king of Argos whom Perseus unfortunately flew Eurystheus the third in succession from him was expelled by the Heraclidae or descendants of Hercules who made themselves masters of Peloponnesus  A M  The kingdom of Athens was first formed into a regular government by Cecrops an Egyptian This prince having quitted Egypt and spent some time in travelling through Phoenicia and other parts came at last into Attica where he married the daughter of Actaeus the king of that country and upon his death succeeded to the throne He taught the people who had hitherto led a wandering life the use of fixed habitations restrained all licentious amours by obliging every man to be content with one wife and for the better administration of justice he instituted the celebrated court of Areopagus Amphictyon the third king of Athens established the famous Amphictyonic Council which makes so capital a figure in the history of Greece And Codrus the last prince of this line devoted himself for the good of his country For in a war between the Athenians and the Heraclidae in which the latter had penetrated to the very gates of Athens Codrus hearing that the Oracle had declared that that people should prove conquerors whose king first fell in the contest disguised himself in the habit of a peasant and going over to the enemy's camp provoked one of their common soldiers who instantly flew him The Heraclidae being informed of this  circumstance concluded that heaven had declared against them and they therefore retreated to their own country without striking another blow After the death of Codrus the title of king was abolished at Athens and that of Archon or chiefgovernor substituted in its stead The duration of this last office was at first for the possessor's life It was afterwards limited to ten years and finally to one  A M Cadmus was the founder of the kingdom of Thebes  To him are attributed sixteen letters of the Greek alphabet though it is probable he borrowed them from the Phoenician characters rather than invented them The adventures of his unhappy posterity Laius Jocasta Oedipus Eteocles and Polynices are well known  The kingdom of Sparta or Lacedaemon is supposed to have been first instituted by Lelexa He  ena the tenth in succession from this monarch is equally famous for her beauty and her infidelity to the marriagebed She had not lived above three years with her husband Menelaus when she was carried off by Paris the son of Priam king of Troy In revenge the Greeks invested that city and took  t after a siege of ten years about the time that Jephtha was judge in Israel  A M  Corinth began to be formed into  tate at a later period than any of the kingdoms abovementioned Its first sovereign was  isyphus the son of Aeolus and upon the expulsion  f his descendants Bacchis assumed the reins of  ower The government after this became aristo  ratical a chief magistrate being annually chosen  y the name of Prytanis At last Cypselus usurped  e supreme authority which he transmitted to his  n Periander who was reckoned one of the seven  ise men of Greece  The kingdom of Macedon was first governed by Caranus descended from Hercules and subsisted from his time till the defeat of Perseus by the Romans a space of six hundred and twentysix years  Such was the political situation of Greece in the early period of its history during which we see that kingly government prevailed in all the states but this was soon changed every where except in Macedonia for a republican mode of government which however was diversified into as many various forms as there were different cities according to the peculiar character of each respective people  These different states though totally independent and sometimes at war with one another were yet united by one common language and one religion by the celebration of public games at which they all assisted and particularly by the famous Amphictyonic Council which met twice a year at Thermopylae in order to deliberate about the general interest of those states of whose deputies it was composed The states that sent deputies to this council were twelve viz the Thessalians the Thebans the Dorians the Ionians the Perhaebeans the Magnetes the Locrians the Oetans the Phthiotes the Maleans the Phocians and the Dolopians Each of these states sent two deputies to the council one of whom was named Hieromnemon and took care of religion the other was called Pylagoras and attended to the civil interests of his community After offering up sacrifices to Apollo Diana Latona and Minerva the deputies took an oath importing that they would never subvert any city of the Amphictyons never stop the course of waters either in war or peace and that they would oppose any attempts to lessen the reverence and authority of the gods to whom they had paid their adoration  These different motives to confederacy united the Greeks for a time into a body of great power and  greater renown By this association a country not half so large as England was able to dispute the empire of the world with the greatest monarchs of the earth By this association they were able not only to oppose but even to rout and disperse the most numerous armies of Persia reducing their power to so low an ebb as to make them submit to the most mortifying conditions of peace But of all the states of Greece the two that made the most capital figure were Athens and Lacedaemon and of these therefore it will be necessary to give a more particular account than our limits will allow us to give of the rest  CHAP II OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SPARTA AND THE LAWS OF LYCURGUS  LACEDAEMON as we have already observed was in the beginning governed by kings of which thirteen in succession held the reins of power of the race of the Pelopidae Under the Heraclidae who succeeded them instead of one king the people admitted two who governed with equal authority This change is said to have been owing to the following circumstance Aristodemus dying left two sons Euristhenes and Procles who were twins and so very much alike that it was hardly possible to distinguish the one from the other and the mother equally attached to both and desirous of advancing both to the throne pretended that she really could not tell which of them was first born or which had the best claim The people therefore invested both with the sovereign power and this form of government however strange continued to subsist for several centuries  It was during this latter period that the Helots or peasants of Sparta were inslaved for these people having taken up arms in order to vindicate their right to the same privileges as the citizens enjoyed which the two first kings had bestowed upon them and of which Agis had deprived them they were after a violent struggle subdued and to punish them for their rebellion they and their posterity were condemned to perpetual slavery and to render their condition as disgraceful as it was miserable all other slaves were called by the general name of Helots  To prevent the repetition of these and the like disorders to which this little state was subject Lycurgus instituted his celebrated body of laws which makes so conspicuous a figure in the history of Greece and which continued for a long time to render Lacedaemon at once the terror and the umpire of the neighbouring kingdoms But before he gave this proof of his patriotism and his abilities as a legislator he gave if possible a still more striking proof of his disinterestedness and love of justice For having succeeded to the throne by the death of his elder brother Polydectes without issue and the queendowager his sisterinlaw afterwards proving with child she offered to destroy the birth provided he would marry her and admit her into a share of power Lycurgus dissembled his resentment at so unnatural a proposal and fearing that she might use means to put her design in execution assured her that as soon as the child was born he would take care to remove it out of the way Accordingly she was delivered of a boy which Lycurgus commanded to be brought to him and presenting him to the people as their lawful sovereign by the name of Charilaus he continued thenceforward to act not as king but as regent  The better to qualify himself for the office of a legislator which he was now about to assume he travelled into Crete and afterwards into Asia where he is said to have made the first discovery of the works of Homer From thence he went into Egypt and having thus made himself acquainted with the customs and institutions of the various countries through which he passed he at length returned home and being assisted in his designs by some of the leading men of the state he published his celebrated code of laws by which it was enacted that the kings should retain their right of succession as before but their authority was considerably diminished by the institution of a Senate consisting of twentyeight members chosen from among the principal citizens into which none were eligible till they were sixty years of age The kings however still enjoyed all their outward marks of dignity and respect They had the chief seats in every public assembly they gave their votes first they received ambassadors and other strangers of distinction and in time of war they had the command of the army though upon these occasions they were subject to the controul of the Senate who sometimes obliged them to march against the enemy or return home when they had least inclination to do either  The Senators too were the more respectable as they held their places for life and besides being possessed of so considerable a share of the executive were invested with the whole of the judicial power and this last part of their duty they executed with such integrity and discretion that though there lay an appeal from them to the people yet their decrees were hardly ever reversed Their authority however was about a century after tempered by the erection of a superior court called the Court of the Ephori consisting of but five members chosen  annually into office and elected from among the people and these had a power to arrest and imprison even the persons of their kings if they acted in a mannner unbecoming their station  In order to reconcile the people to this mode of government in which though they had a nominal they had no real share Lycurgus fell upon two expedients equally bold and decisive These were to divide all the lands of the state equally among the citizens and to abolish the use of money The lands of Laconia he divided into thirty thousand parts and those of Sparta into nine thousand and these he portioned out to the respective inhabitants of each district To abolish the use of money he did not think it necessary to deprive those who were possessed of gold and silver of their property He thought it sufficient to cry down the value of those metals and to order that nothing but iron money should pass in exchange for any commodity This coin also he made so heavy and fixed at so low a rate that a cart and two oxen were required to carry home a sum of ten minae or about twenty pounds sterling As this coin had no currency among the other states of Greece it soon fell into contempt even among the Spartans themselves who despised it so much that money was at last brought into difuse and few troubled themselves with more than was necessary to answer their daily expences  To enforce the practice of temperance and sobriety Lycurgus further ordained that all the men should eat in one common hall in public Every one was obliged to send thither his provisions monthly consisting of one bushel of flour eight measures of wine five pounds of cheese and two pounds and a half of figs and this regulation was so rigidly observed that a long time after when Agis returned from a successful expedition he was severely reprimanded for having eaten with his  queen in private Black broth was their favourite dish of what ingredients it was composed is not known but as they used no flesh in their entertainments it probably resembled those lenten soups which are still in use on the continent Dionysius the tyrant found this fare very unpalatable but as the cook asserted the broth was nothing without the seasoning of fatigue and hunger  To accustom the youth to early habits of discipline and obedience Lycurgus took their education out of the hands of their parents and committed it to masters appointed by the state So desirous indeed was he of having a hardy and robust race of citizens that he began the work of education even from the time of the mother's conception making it her duty to use such diet and exercise as might fit her to produce a healthy and vigorous offspring Nay such children as were born with any capital defect were not suffered to be brought up but were exposed to perish in a cavern near mount Taygetus and such as upon a public view were deemed to be sound and healthy were adopted as children of the state and delivered to their parents to be nursed with rigour and severity From their tenderest years they were accustomed to make no choice in their eating not to be afraid in the dark or when left alone not to be peevish or fretful to walk barefoot to lie hard at nights to wear the same clothes summer and winter and to fear nothing from their equals At the age of seven they were taken from their parents and delivered over to the classes for a public education Their discipline there was still more rigid and severe They were still obliged to go barefoot their heads were shaved and they fought with one another naked  To enable them the better to endure bodily pain without complaining they were annually whipt at the altar of Diana and the boy that bore  this punishment with the greatest fortitude came off victorious Plutarch tells us that he has seen several children expire under this cruel treatment and he makes mention of one who having stolen a fox and hid it under his coat chose rather to let the animal tear out his bowels than discover the theft In order to prepare them for the stratagems of war they were permitted to steal from one another but if they were caught in the fact they were punished for their want of dexterity At twelve years of age they were removed into a class of a more advanced kind There their labour and discipline were increased with their years They had now their skirmishes between small parties and their mock fights between larger bodies and in these they sometimes fought with such obstinacy that they were seen to lose their eyes and even their lives before they gave up the contest Such was the constant discipline of their minority which lasted till the age of thirty before which they were not permitted to marry to go into the troops or to bear any office in the state  The discipline of the virgins was as severe as that of the young men They were enured to a life of labour and industry till they were twenty years of age before which time they were not allowed to be marriageable They had also their peculiar exercises They ran wrestled and pitched the bar and performed all these feats naked before the whole body of the citizens Yet this was thought no way indecent as it was supposed that the frequent view of the person would tend rather to check than excite every irregular desire An education so manlike did not fail to bestow upon the Spartan woman equal vigour of body and mind They were bold hardy and patriotic filled with a sense of honour and a love of military glory Some foreign women in conversation with the wife of Leonidas  saying that the Spartan women alone knew how to govern the men she boldly replied  "The Spartan women alone bring forth men"  A mother was known to give her son who was going to battle his shield with this gallant advice  "Return with it or return upon it"  thereby in effect telling him that rather than throw it away in flight he should be borne home upon it dead Another hearing that her son was killed fighting for his country she answered without any emotion  "It was for that I brought him into the world"  After the battle of Leuctra the parents of those who fell in the action went to the temples to thank the gods that their sons had done their duty while those whose children survived that dreadful day were overwhelmed with grief  Besides these general regulations there were many other subordinate maxims that by long and constant practice obtained the force of laws The Spartans were expressly forbid to exercise any mechanic art War was their chief occupation and in time of peace they employed themselves in hunting or bodily exercises The Helots or slaves tilled their lands for them and received for their labour a bare subsistence Nor was this the only hardship to which these unhappy men were subject They were in a manner bound to the soil nor was it even lawful to sell them to strangers or to make them free Nay if at any time their numbers  ncreased to such a degree as to excite the suspicion of their cruel masters there was a  C  yptia  or  secret act  by which it was permitted to dest  oy them without mercy Thucydides relates that two thousand of these slaves disappeared at once without ever after being heard of Nor were they only thus wantonly put to death they were even made a mockery of while living They were frequently intoxicated on purpose and in that condition exposed before the  children in order to deter them from this kind of debauchery  As to the citizens themselves being possessed by means of their slaves of competence and leisure they were almost always in company in their large common halls where they met and conversed with one another The love of their country was their ruling passion and all selfinterest seemed lost in the general wish for the welfare of the public Pedarctus having missed the honour of being chosen one for the three hundred who had a certain rank in the city converted his disappointment into joy  "that there were three hundred better men in Sparta than he"  The Spartans were forbid to make frequent war upon the same people lest they should teach their discipline to others When they had broken and routed their enemies they never pursued them farther than was necessary to make themselves sure of the victory This had an excellent effect for the enemy knowing that all who resisted were put to the sword often fled as they were convinced that this was the most effectual means of ensuring their safety With the Spartans themselves the case was directly the reverse For their first and most inviolable maxim was never to turn their backs on the enemy however unequal to them in numbers nor ever to deliver up their arms till they resigned them with their life Nay they would not suffer the contrary notion to be propagated or even mentioned among them For when the poet Archilochus came to Sparta he was obliged to quit the city for having asserted in one of his poems that it was better for a man to lose his arms than his life Thus depending upon their valour alone their legislator would not allow them to wall the city It was his opinion that a wall of men was preferable to a wall of brick and that valour which is obliged  to take shelter within a fortification is little better than cowardice  Such was the general purport of the institutions of Lycurgus which from their tendency gained the esteem and admiration of all the surrounding states In order to render them as lasting as they were excellent Lycurgus pretended that something was still wanting to the completion of his plan and that it was necessary for him to go and consult the oracle of Delphos In the mean time he persuaded his countrymen to take an oath for the strict observance of all his laws till his return and then left Sparta with a firm resolution of never seeing it more When he arrived at Delphos he enquired of the oracle whether the laws he had made were sufficient to render the Lacedaemonians happy and being told that they were he sent this answer to Sparta and then voluntarily starved himself to death Others say that he died in Crete ordering his body to be burnt and his ashes to be thrown into the sea Whichever of these was the case he equally obliged his countrymen by the oath they had taken to observe his laws for ever which indeed they were sufficiently inclined to do from a conviction of their real and intrinsic merit  The first opportunity which the Spartans had to display the superiority of their power among the neighbouring states was in the war between them and the Messenians This war lasted twenty years and is remarkable for two incidents that are well worthy of notice The Spartans having drained their city of all its male inhabitants in order to carry on the war and having bound themselves by an oath not to return home till they had conquered the enemy their women in the mean time remonstrated that from their long absence all posterity would be at an end To remedy this inconvenience they detached  fifty of their most promising young men from the army to go to Sparta and to lie promiscuously with all the young women they pleased The offspring of these virgins were from them called Partheniae who finding themselves despised by the Spartans on their return as a spurious race joined some years after in an insurrection with the Helots but were soon suppressed Being expelled the state they went under the conduct of their Captain Phalantus and settled at Tarentum in Italy  The other incident is this The Messenians having sent to consult the oracle of Delphos received for answer that they must offer a virgin of the family of Aepytus as a sacrifice The lot fell upon the daughter of Lyciscus but she being thought to be supposititious Aristodemus offered his daughter whom all allowed to be his own Her lover however attempted to avert the blow by asserting that she was with child by him but her father was so enraged at the imputation that he ripped up her belly with his own hands publicly in order to vindicate her innocence The enthusiasm produced by this sacrifice served for a while to give the Messenians the advantage but being at last overthrown and besieged in the city of I thoe they were obliged to submit to the Spartans and Aristodemus slew himself on his daughter's grave  After a rigorous subjection of thirtynine years the Messenians made one effort more for the recovery of their liberty under the conduct of Aristomenes who thrice defeated the Spartan army and as often merited the Hecatomphonia a sacrifice due to those who had killed one hundred of the enemy hand to hand in battle But the Spartans being headed by the famous Athenian poet and schoolmaster Tyrtaeus who inflamed their courage by his songs and orations the Messenians were at last  A M  obliged to abandon their country which was added to the territory of Sparta and thus rendered that kingdom one of the most powerful states in all Greece  CHAP III OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS THE LAWS OF SOLON AND THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLIC FROM THE TIME OF SOLON TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE PERSIAN WAR  THE happy effects produced at Sparta by the institutions of Lycurgus at last in spired the Athenians with a desire of being governed by written laws and the first person they pitched upon for a legislator was Draco a man of equal integrity and wisdom but rigid and severe in the highest degree  A M  Draco inflicted death on all crimes without exception and being asked why he did so replied  "Small crimes deserve death and I have no higher punishment even for the greatest"  His laws indeed were so severe that they were said to be written not with ink but with blood Their severity however defeated their intention It was impossible to carry them into execution They therefore fell into disuse and the people from the neglect and contempt of laws soon grew more licentious than ever they had been before any written laws existed It was in this distressful state of the Republic that Solon was applied to for his advice and assistance in regulating the government  To mention all the proofs he had given of his wisdom before he was advanced to the office of legislator would be foreign to our purpose Suffice it to say that he was one of the seven wise men of  Greece The others were Thales the Milesian Chilo of Lacedaemon Pittacus of Mitylene Periander of Corinth and Bias and Cleobulus whose birthplaces are uncertain One day at the court of Periander a question was proposed which was the most perfect popular government That said Bias where the laws have no superior That said Thales where the people are neither too rich nor too poor That said Anacharsis the Scythian where virtue is honoured and vice detested That said Pittacus where dignities are always conferred upon the virtuous and never upon the base That said Cleobulus where the citizens fear blame more than punishment That said Chilo where the laws are more regarded than the orators But Solon's opinion seems to be best founded who said where an injury done to the meanest subject is an insult upon the whole community  Nor must we omit his celebrated interview with Croesus king of Lydia That monarch who was reputed the richest prince of his time having displayed before him his immense wealth and treasures asked whether he did not think him the happiest of mankind No replied Solon I know one man more happy a poor peasant of Greece who neither in affluence nor poverty has but few wants and has learned to supply them by his own labour But at least said the vain monarch do you not think me happy Alas cried Solon what man can be pronounced happy before he dies The sagacity of Solon's replies appeared in the sequel The kingdom of Lydia was invaded by Cyrus the empire destroyed and Croesus himself taken prisoner When he was led out to execution according to the barbarous manners of the times he then recollected the maxims of Solon and could not help crying out when on the scaffold upon Solon's name Cyrus hearing him repeat the name with great earnestness  was desirous of knowing the reason and being informed by Croesus of that philosopher's remarkable observation he began to fear for himself pardoned Croesus and took him for the future into confidence and friendship Thus Solon had the merit of saving one king's life and of reforming another  Such was the man whom the Athenians how raised to the high dignity of Archon and invested with full power to newmodel the government Solon however was sensible that there were certain disorders in the state that were altogether incurable and with these therefore he resolved not in the least to meddle In a word as he himself declared he gave his countrymen not the best of all possible laws but the best they were capable of receiving His first step was in favour of the poor whose debts he abolished at once and who had been grievously oppressed by the rich by the exorbitant interest they exacted from them But to do this with the least injury he could to the creditor he raised the value of money a little and by that means nominally increased their riches His next step was to repeal all the laws of Draco except those against murder He then proceeded to the regulation of offices employments and magistracies all which he left in the hands of the rich He divided the rich citizens into three classes ranging them according to their incomes Those that had five hundred measures yearly as well in corn as liquids were placed in the first rank those that had three hundred were placed in the second and those that had but two hundred made up the third All the rest of the citizens whose income fell short of two hundred measures were comprised in a fourth and last class and were considered as incapable of holding any employment whatever But to compensate for this exclusion he gave every private citizen a right  to vote in the great assembly of the whole body of the people And this indeed was a right of a most important nature For by the laws of Athens it was permitted after the decision of the magistrates to appeal to the general assembly of the people and thus in time all causes of weight and consequence came before them  To counteract however the influence of a popular assembly Solon gave greater weight to the court of Areopagus and also instituted another council consisting of four hundred Before his time the Areopagus was composed of such citizens as were most remarkable for their probity and wisdom But Solon now ordained that none should be admitted into it but such as had passed through the office of Archon By this means the dignity and consequently the authority of the court were greatly increased and such was its reputation for integrity and discernment that the Romans sometimes referred causes which were too intricate for their own decision to the determination of this tribunal The business of the council of four hundred was to judge upon appeals from the Areopagus and maturely to examine every question before it came before the general assembly of the people  Such was the reformation in the general plan of government his particular laws for the administration of justice were more numerous and equally  udicious To promote a spirit of patriotism and prevent all selfish indifference about the concerns of the Republic he ordained that whoever in public dissensions espoused neither party but remained neuter should be declared infamous condemned to perpetual exile and to have all his estates confiscated From a similar motive he permitted every person to espouse the quarrel of any one that was injured or insulted He abolished the custom of giving portions with young women unless they were  only children He wished to render matrimony an honourable connection and not as it formerly had too often been and still continues to be a mere matter of traffic He allowed every one that was childless to dispose of his wealth as he pleased without being obliged to leave it to the next of kin By this means the natural dependence of the young upon the old was strengthened and increased He lessened the rewards of the victors at the Olympic and Isthmian games whom he considered as an useless and often a dangerous set of citizens and bestowed the money thus saved upon the widows and children of those who had fallen in the service of their country  To encourage industry he empowered the Areopagus to enquire into every man's method of procuring a livelihood and to punish such as had no visible way of doing so With the like view he or dained that a son should not be obliged to support his father in old age or necessity if the latter had neglected to give him some trade or calling and all illegitimate children were exempted from the same duty as they owed nothing to their parents but the stigma of their birth No one was allowed to revile another in public the magistrates were obliged to be particularly circumspect in their behaviour and it was even death for an Archon to be taken drunk Against the crime of parricide he made no law as supposing it could never exist in any society To preserve the sanctity of the marriagebed he permitted any one to kill an adulterer if he was taken in the fact and though he allowed of public brothels he branded both the women and men who frequented them with an indelible mark of disgrace  Such were the chief institutions of this celebrated lawgiver which he bound the Athenians by a public oath to observe religiously at least for the space of a hundred years and having thus completed the  task assigned him he set out on his travels leaving his countrymen to become habituated to the new form of government But it was not easy for a people long torn by civil dissensions to yield implicit obedience to any laws however wisely framed their former animosities began to revive when that authority was removed which alone could hold them in subjection The factions of the state were headed by three different leaders Pisistratus Megacles and Lycurgus Of these Pisistratus was at once the most powerful the most artful and in the end the most successful He had many virtues and hardly a single vice except that of an inordinate ambition He was learned himself and an encourager of learning in others Cicero says he was the first that made the Athenians acquainted with the works of Homer that he disposed of them in the order in which we now have them and first caused them to be read at the feasts called Panathenaea  By his promises his professions his liberality and address he so far gained upon the affections of his countrymen that he was just upon the point of making himself master of the government when he had the mortification to see Solon return after an absence of ten years fully apprised of his treacherous designs and determined if possible to prevent their completion This however he could not do for any length of time for Pisistratus now finding his schemes ripe for execution gave himself several wounds which he pretended to have received in the cause of the people and in that condition with his body all bloody he ordered himself to be carried in his chariot to the marketplace where by his complaints and eloquence he so inflamed the minds of the populace that he obtained a guard of fifty persons for the security of his person This was all he aimed at for having now got the rudiments of a standing army he soon increased it to such a degree  as to enable him to set all opposition at defiance In a little time therefore he seized upon the citadel and in effect usurped the supreme power Solon did not long survive the liberties of his country He died about two years after at the age of eighty admired and lamented by all the states of Greece as the greatest legislator and excepting Homer the greatest poet that had hitherto appeared  By adhering to the same arts by which he had acquired his power Pisistratus contrived to maintain himself in the possession of it to his dying day and transmitted it to his two sons Hippias and Hipparchus These young men seemed to tread in the footsteps of their father They encouraged learning and learned men They invited to their court Anacreon Simonides and other poets and honoured them with their friendship and loaded them with presents They established schools for the improvement of youth and caused Mercuries to be erected in all the highways with moral sentences written upon them for the instruction of the lowest vulgar Their reign however lasted but eighteen years and terminated upon the following occasion  Harmodius and Aristogiton two citizens of Athens had contracted a most sincere and inviolable friendship and resolved to consider any insult that should be offered to either as an injury done to both Hipparchus being naturally of an amorous disposition debauched the sister of Harmodius and afterwards published her shame as she was about to walk in one of the sacred processions alledging that she was not in a condition to assist at the ceremony Such an indignity was not to be borne and they therefore resolved to destroy the tyrant which after various efforts they at last effected though they themselves fell in the attempt Hippias naturally wreaked his resentment upon all whom he supposed  privy to the conspiracy and among others upon a courtezan of the name of Leona whose courage and constancy deserve to be mentioned When put to the torture she bore all the cruelty of her executioners with invincible fortitude and lest she should in the agony of pain be induced to a confession she bit off her tongue and spit it in the tyrant's face To perpetuate her memory the Athenians erected a statue representing a lioness without a tongue  A M  Hippias dreading the fate of his brother endeavoured to fortify himself by foreign alliances and particularly by one with the Lacedaemonians but in this he was prevented by the family of the Alcmaeonidae who had been banished from Athens at the beginning of the usurpation and who having rebuilt the temple of Delphos in a most magnificent manner had secured the priestess in their interest Whenever therefore the Spartans came to consult the Oracle they never received any promise of the God's assistance but upon condition of setting Athens free This task therefore they resolved to undertake and though unsuccessful in their first attempt they at last dethroned the tyrant the very same year in which the kings were expelled from Rome The family of Alcmaeon were chiefly instrumental in this great work but the people seemed fonder of acknowledging their obligations to the two friends who struck the first blow The names of Harmodius and Aristogiton were ever after held in the highest veneration and their statues were erected in the marketplace an honour which had never been paid to any one before  CHAP IV FROM THE EXPULSION OF HIPPIAS TO THE DEATH OF MILTIADES  THOUGH Hippias upon being driven from the throne was obliged to abandon his native country he did not however abandon all hopes of being able some time or other to recover his lost power He first applied to the Lacedaemonians and that people seemed sufficiently willing to espouse his cause and they thought they might the more easily effect his restoration as Athens was at this time thrown into confusion by the introduction of the new mode of voting by ostracism that is of procuring the banishment of any citizen for ten years whose wealth or popularity rendered him dangerous to the state by allowing every one above sixty years of age to give in the name of the obnoxious person written upon a tile or oystershell Before they undertook however to assist Hippias in reascending the throne they thought it prudent to consult the other states of Greece with regard to the propriety of the measure and finding them all to be totally averse to it they abandoned the tyrant and his cause for ever  Hippias disappointed in his hopes of aid from the Lacedaemonians had recourse to one whom he considered as a much more powerful patron This was Artaphernes governor of Sardis for the king of Persia To him he represented the facility with which an entire conquest might be made of Athens and the Persian court influenced by the prospect of gaining such an addition of territory and particularly such an extent of seacoast readily adopted the proposal When the Athenians therefore sent a messenger into Persia to vindicate their proceedings with regard to Hippias they received for answer  "That if they wished to be safe they must admit Hippias for their king  But these gallant republicans had too ardent a passion for liberty and too rooted an aversion to slavery patiently to submit to so imperious a mandate They therefore returned to it a flat and peremptory refusal And from that time forward the Athenians and Persians began to prepare for commencing hostilities against each other  The gallantry indeed of the Athenians upon this occasion is the more to be admired as their numbers and resources bore no proportion to those of the prince whom they thus set at defiance The Persian monarch was at that time the most powerful sovereign in the universe whereas the small state of Athens did not contain above twenty thousand citizens ten thousand strangers and about fifty or sixty thousand servants The state of Sparta which afterwards took such a considerable share and made so capital a figure in the war against Persia was still more inconsiderable with respect to numbers These did not amount to above nine thousand citizens and about thirty thousand peasants And yet these two states with very little assistance from the inferior republics were able not only to resist but even to baffle and defeat all the attempts of the Persian monarch a memorable instance what acts of heroism may be performed by men animated by a love of freedom and inspired with a passion for military glory  The restoration of Hippias was not the only cause of quarrel between the Persians and the Athenians The Greek colonies of lonia Aeolia and Caria that had been settled for above five hundred years in Asia Minor were at length subdued by Croesus king of Lydia and he in turn sinking under the power of Cyrus his conquests of course fell in with the rest of his dominions These colonies  however had not yet lost all memory of the liberty they had formerly enjoyed and they therefore seized every opportunity of delivering themselves from the Persian yoke and recovering their ancient independence In this they were now encouraged by Histiaeus the governor or tyrant as he was called of Miletus for all the Persian governors of these provinces were by the Greeks called tyrants This man having rendered his fidelity suspected at the Persian court had no other way of providing for his own safety than by exciting the Ionians to a revolt By his direction therefore Aristagoras his deputy first applied to the Lacedaemonians for assistance and failing of success in that quarter he next had recourse to the Athenians where he met with a more favourable reception The Athenians were at this time inflamed with the highest resentment against the Persian monarch on account of his naughty mandate with regard to the restoration of Hippias and they therefore supplied the Ionians with twenty ships to which the Eretrians and Eupoeans added five more  Thus supported Aristagoras entered the Persian territories and penetrating into the heart of Lydia he burned Sardis the capital city but being soon after deserted by the Athenians on account of some  hecks he received he found himself altogether un  ble to make head against the power of Persia and  hough he contrived to maintain the struggle for the  pace of six years yet he was at last obliged to fly  nto Thrace where he was cut off with all his fol  owers As to Histiaeus himself being taken pri  oner with a few of the insurgents he was conduct  d to Artaphernes and that inhuman tyrant imme  ediately ordered him to be crucified and his head  o be sent to Darius  The commencement of this war naturally tended to widen the breach between the Athenians and Persians and the conclusion of it was no less calculated to inflame the pride and presumption of the latter and to inspire them with the ambitious thoughts of making an entire conquest of Greece To pave the way for this grand project Darius in the twentyeighth year of his reign having recalled all his other generals sent his soninlaw Mardonius to command throughout the maritime parts of Asia and particularly to revenge the burning of Sardis which he could neither forgive nor forget But his fleet being shattered in a storm in doubling the cape of Mount Athos and his army repulsed and himself wounded by the Thracians who attacked him suddenly by night Mardonius returned to the Persian court covered with shame and confusion for having miscarried in his enterprize both by sea and land Darius therefore displaced him and appointed two older and abler generals namely Datis a Mede and Artaphernes son of the late governor of Sardis in his stead At the same time he exerted himself with unwearied diligence in furnishing them with such an army and navy as might render them morally certain of success  Previous however to his invasion of Greece he thought it became his dignity and humanity to send heralds into that country to require submission from the different states or to threaten them with his vengeance in case of refusal The lesser states intimidated by his power readily submitted but the Athenians and Spartans nobly disdained to acknowledge subjection to any earthly sovereign When therefore the heralds demanded earth and water the usual method of requiring submission from inferior states these spirited republicans threw the one into a well and the other into a ditch and tauntingly  bid them take earth and water from thence Nay they went still farther they resolved to punish  he Aeginetans for having basely submitted to the  ower of Persia and by that means betrayed the  ommon cause of Greece These people indeed made some resistance They even carried on a  aval war against the Athenians but these last hav  g at length overcome them increased their own  avy to such a degree as to render it almost an equal  atch for that of Persia  In the mean time Darius having completed his  vies sent away his generals Datis and Arta  hernes to what be considered as a certain con  est They were furnished with a fleet of six  undred ships and an army of an hundred and  wenty thousand men and their instructions were  give up Athens and Eretria to be plundered to  urn all the houses and temples of both and to lead  way the inhabitants into captivity The country  as to be laid desolate and the army was provided  ith a sufficient number of chains for binding the  isoners  To oppose this formidable invasion the Athenians  d only about ten thousand men but all of them  imated with that invincible spirit which the love  liberty ever inspires They were at this time  aded by three of the greatest generals and statesmen  eir country ever produced though no country  er produced more These were Miltiades The  istocles and Aristides The first was looked  on as the ablest commander the second was so  nd of a popular government and so eager to in  atiate himself with his fellowcitizens that he was  quently accused of acts of partiality Indeed  seemed to glory in the charge for one day  en somebody was talking to him on the subject  d saying that he would make an excellent magis  te it he had more impartiality  "God forbid  replied he that I should ever sit upon a tribunal where my friends should find no more favour than strangers"  As to Aristides he was so rigidly and inflexibly just that his name has descended to posterity as almost another term for justice itself  The first brunt of the war fell upon the Eretrians who being utterly unable to oppose so mighty a force in the field shut themselves up in the town but though they defended the place with great gallantry yet after a siege of seven days it was taken by storm and reduced to ashes The inhabitants were put in chains and sent as the firstfruits of victory to the Persian monarch but he contrary to their expectation treated them with great lenity and gave them a village in the country of Cissa for their residence where Apollonius Tyanaeus found their descendants six hundred years after  Elated with this success the Persians advanced into the heart of the country and being directed in their march by Hippias the expelled tyrant of Athens they soon arrived in the plains of Marathon about ten miles distant from that city There however it was that the Athenians resolved to oppose them but not thinking themselves singly equal to such an undertaking they first sent to the Spartans for assistance and would certainly have obtained it had it not been for a foolish superstition which prevailed among that people and which would not allow them to begin a march before the full moon They then applied to the other states of Greece but these were too much intimidated by the power of Persia to venture to move in their defence  Obliged therefore to depend upon their own courage alone they collected all their forces to the number of ten thousand men and entrusted the command of them to ten generals of whom Miltiades was the chief and each of these was to have the direction of the troops for one day at a time in  regular succession But this arrangement was soon found to be so very inconvenient that by the advice of Aristides the chief command was vested in Miltiades alone as the ablest and most experienced of all the generals At the same time it was resolved in a council of war though only by a majority of one vote to meet the enemy in the open field instead of waiting for them within the walls of the city  Miltiades sensible of the inferiority of his numbers when compared to those of the enemy endeavoured to make up for this defect by taking possession of an advantageous ground He therefore drew up his army at the foot of a mountain so that the enemy should not be able to surround him or charge him in the rear At the same time he fortified his flanks with a number of large trees that were cut down for the purpose Datis saw the advantage which the Athenians must derive from this masterly disposition but relying on the superiority of his numbers and unwilling to wait till the Spartan succours should arrive he resolved to begin the engagement The signal for battle however was no sooner given than the Athenians instead of waiting for the onset of the enemy according to their usual custom rushed in upon them with irresistible fury The Persians regarded this first step as the result of madness and despair rather than of deliberate courage but they were soon convinced of their mistake when they found that the Athenians maintained the charge with the same spirit with which they had begun it Miltiades had purposely and judiciously made his wings much stronger than his center which was commanded by Themistocles and Aristides The Persians availing themselves of this circumstance attacked the center with great bravery and were just upon the point of making it give way when the two wings having now become  victorious suddenly wheeled about and falling upon the enemy in both flanks at once threw them into disorder The rout in a moment became universal and they fled to their ships with great precipitation The Athenians pursued them as far as the beach and even set several of their ships on fire It was on this occasion that Cynaegyrus the brother of the poet Aeschylus seized one of the enemy's ships with his right hand as they were pushing it off from the shore When his right hand was cut off he laid hold of the vessel with his left and that likewise being lopt off he at last seized it with his teeth and in that manner expired  A M  Seven of the enemy's ships were taken and above six thousand of them left dead upon the field of battle not to mention those who were drowned as they were endeavouring to escape or were consumed in the ships that were set on fire Of the Greeks there fell not above two hundred and among these was Callimachus who gave the casting vote for fighting the enemy in the field Hippias who was the chief cause of the war is thought to have perished in this battle though some say he escaped and afterwards died miserably at Lemnos  Such was the famous battle of Marathon one of the most important that is to be found in history as it first taught the Greeks to despise the power of the Persian monarch and bravely to maintain their own independence and thus to go on cultivating those arts and sciences which had so evident a tendency to polish and refine their own manners and have since diffused their benign influence over all the rest of Europe  Of the marble which the Persians had brought with them to erect a monument in memory of their expected victory the Athenians now caused a statue to be made by the celebrated sculptor Phidias to transmit  to posterity the remembrance of their defeat This statue was dedicated to the goddess Nemesis who had a temple near the place Monuments were at the same time erected to the memory of all those who had fallen in the battle and upon these were inscribed their own names and the name of the tribe to which they belonged Of these monuments there were three kinds one for the Athenians one for the Plataeans their allies and one for the slaves who had been enrolled into the troops upon this pressing emergency To express their gratitude to Miltiades the Athenians caused a picture to be painted by one of their most eminent artists named Polygnotus in which that great commander was represented at the head of the other generals animating the troops and setting them an example of bravery  But their gratitude to this celebrated warrior however sincere was by no means lasting The Athenians with all their good qualities were naturally fickle and apt to be jealous of such as either by their merit their power or popularity had in their opinion rendered themselves dangerous to the state Of this Miltiades had very soon after a mortifying proof For having received a wound in an expedition against the Parians and being thereby prevented from appearing in public to defend himself from a charge of bribery which was brought against him by one Xanthippus sentence was of course passed upon him in his absence and he was condemned to lose his life This severe sentence however the Athenians had not the effrontery to execute upon one who had done them such essential services and they therefore changed it into a fine of fifty talents and as this was a sum which Miltiades could not pay he was thrown into prison where he soon after died But the Athenians would not suffer his body to be buried till the fine was  paid His son Cimon therefore by exerting all his interest among his friends and relations was at last able to raise the requisite sum to pay the fine and to procure his father an honourable interment  CHAP V FROM THE DEATH OF MILTIADES TO THE RETREAT OF XERXES OUT OF GREECE  DARIUS rather enraged than intimidated by the loss he had sustained in the battle of Marathon was preparing to invade Greece in person when happily for the peace of that country death put an end to his ambitious project His son Xerxes however who succeded him on the throne was determined to execute the plan which his father had formed Having just returned from a successful expedition he had made into Egypt he expected to meet with the like good fortune in Europe Confident of victory he did not chuse he said for the future to buy the figs of Attica he would possess himself of the country and thus have figs of his own But before he would engage in so important an enterprize he thought proper to consult the principal officers of his court Mardonius his brotherinlaw well knowing his secret sentiments and willing to flatter him in his favourite pursuits highly applauded the resolution he had taken But Artabanus his uncle whom years and experience had rendered wife used every argument he could think of in order to divert him from his rash design and he addressed himself to the king in the following terms  "Permit me Sir said he to deliver my sentiments upon this occasion with that liberty which becomes my age and my regard for your interest  When Darius your father and my brother first thought of making war upon the Scythians I used all my endeavours to divert him from it The people you are going to attack are infinitely more formidable than they If the Athenians alone could defeat the numerous army commanded by Datis and Artaphernes what ought we to expect from an opposition of all the states of Greece united You design to pass from Asia into Europe by laying a bridge over the sea But what if the Athenians should advance and destroy this bridge and so prevent our return Let us not expose ourselves to such dangers especially as we have no sufficient motives to induce us to run such risks at least let us take time to reflect upon the matter When we have maturely considered an affair whatever happens to be the success of it we have nothing to regret Precipitation is imprudent and is usually unsuccessful Above all do not suffer yourself great prince to be dazzled with the splendor of imaginary glory The highest trees have the most reason to dread being struck with the thunder As for you Mardonius who so earnestly urge this expedition if it must be so lead it forward But let the king whose life is dear to us all return into Persia In the mean time let your children and mine be given up as a pledge to answer for the success of the war If the issue be favourable I consent that mine be put to death but if it be otherwise as I foresee it will then I desire that you and your children may receive the reward of rashness" The pride of the Persian monarch could not easily bear such a plain but honest speech even from an uncle and he therefore sternly replied  "Thank the gods that thou art my father's brother were it not for that thou shouldst this moment receive the just reward of thy audacious behaviour But you shall have your punishment  remain here behind among the women these you but too much resemble in your cowardice and fear Stay here while I march at the head of my troops where my duty and glory call me"  Xerxes having thus resolved upon his expedition into Greece began to make preparations for carrying it forward and the greatness of these shewed the high sense he entertained of the power and bravery of the enemy Sardis was the place of general rendezvous for his land forces and the fleet was ordered to advance along the coasts of Asia Minor towards the Hellespont In its way thither in order to shorten its passage he cut a canal through the neck of land that joined Mount Athos to the continent and while this was doing he addressed the mountain with all that pomp and ostentation for which the Eastern princes have ever been so remarkable  "Athos" said he "thou proud aspiring mountain that liftest up thy head unto the heavens be not so audacious to put obstacles in my way If thou dost I will cut thee level with the plain and throw thee headlong into the sea"  In his march to Sardis he gave a shocking proof of the extreme acts of cruelty he was capable of committing whenever his authority was called in question Having required the eldest son of Pythias a Lydian prince to attend him in the war the father offered him all his treasure amounting to about four millions sterling to purchase his exemption and as the young man seemed desirous of staying at home Xerxes commanded him immediately to be put to death before his father's eyes Then causing the body to be cut in two and one part of it to be placed on the right and the other on the left he made his whole army pass between them a terrible example of what every one had to expect that dared to dispute his orders  His army was composed not merely of Persians but of Medes Lydians Bactrians Assyrians Hyrcanians in a word of every people that either acknowledged his authority dreaded his power or courted his alliance It is said to have amounted to above two millions of men His fleet consisted of fourteen hundred and twentyseven ships besides a thousand lesser vessels that were employed in carrying provisions On board of these were six hundred thousand men so that the whole army might be said to amount to above two millions and a half which with the women slaves and sutlers always attending a Persian camp might make the whole about five millions of souls a force which if rightly conducted might have given law to the universe but being commanded by ignorance and presumption was soon after repulsed and finally defeated by the small but gallant states of Greece  With this mighty armament Xerxes set out on his expedition into Greece ten years after the battle of Marathon  A M  Upon reviewing his forces his heart was naturally elated with joy from a consciousness of his superior power but this soon gave place to the feelings of humanity and he burst into tears when he reflected that a hundred years hence not one of so many thousands would be alive He had previously given orders for building a bridge of boats across the Hellespont or as it is now called the Dardanelles which separates Asia from Europe and is about an English mile over But this bridge when completed being carried away by the current Xerxes like a tyrant wreaked his vengeance upon the workmen and like a lunatic upon the sea He caused the heads of the former to be struck off and a certain number of lashes to be inflicted upon the latter to punish it for its insolence and fetters to be thrown into it to teach it for the future obedience  to his will a striking proof how much the possession of despotic power tends not only to corrupt the heart but even to weaken and blind the understanding Another and a stronger bridge was soon after built and over this the army passed though such was its immense number the whole could not cross in less than seven days  Xerxes having thus reached Europe began his march directly for Greece receiving every where the submission of the countries through which he passed Even the smaller states of Greece overawed by his power submitted at the first summons Athens and Sparta alone those glorious republics nobly disdained such pusillanimous conduct They gallantly resolved to oppose the invader of their country and either to preserve their liberties entire or to perish in the attempt From the moment that Xerxes began his preparations they had received intelligence of his designs and they in their turn began to take measures for rendering them abortive They had also sent spies to Sardis in order to bring them an exact account of the number and quality of the enemy's forces The spies indeed were seized but Xerxes instead of punishing or even detaining them ordered them to be conducted through his camp and then dismissed desiring them at the same time on their return home to give a faithful relation of what they had seen The Athenians and Spartans however neither intimidated by the mighty force that now came against them nor by the base submission of the inferior states nobly resolved to face the common danger with joint forces These forces did not amount to above eleven thousand two hundred men and yet with this handful of troops they determined to oppose the almost innumerable army of Xerxes  Their first care was to appoint a general and they wisely made choice of Themistocles the ablest  commander that had appeared in Greece since the death of Miltiades They likewise recalled Aristides who had been driven into banishment by the faction of his enemies at the head of which indeed was Themistocles such is the jealousy that sometimes prevails between great men though equally attached to the interest of their country It was upon the occasion of his banishment that a peasant who could not write and did not know Aristides personally applied to him and desired him to write the name of that citizen upon the shell by which his vote was given against him  "Has he done you any wrong" said Aristides "that you are for condemning him in this manner"  "No" replied the peasant "but I hate to hear him always praised for his justice"  Aristides without saying a word more calmly took the shell wrote down his name upon it and contentedly retired into exile Themistocles however convinced of his uncommon merit and willing to have the benefit of his counsels was now as desirous of having him recalled as ever he had been to see him banished and these two great men generously forgetting all their private feuds and animosities resolved to exert their joint efforts in promoting the good of the public  Themistocles saw that the enemy must be opposed by sea as well as by land and to enable him to do this with the greater effect he had lately caused an hundred gallies to be built and turned all his thoughts towards the improvement of the navy The oracle had declared some time before that Athens should only defend herself with wooden walls and he took the advantage of this ambiguity to persuade his countrymen that by such walls was only meant her shipping The Lacedaemonians used no less industry in improving their navy so that upon the approach of Xerxes the confederates  found themselves possessed of a squadron of two hundred and eighty sail the command of which was conferred upon Eurybiades a Spartan  The next point to be determined was which was the most proper place for making the first stand against the enemy and after some deliberation the straits of Thermopylae were pitched upon for the purpose This was a narrow pass of twentyfive feet broad between Thessaly and Phocis defended by the remains of an old wall with gates to it and remarkable for some hot baths from whence the place had its name The command of this important pass was given to Leonidas one of the kings of Sparta who led thither a body of six thousand men Of these three hundred only were Spartans the rest consisted of Boeotians Corinthians Phocians and other allies This chosen band were taught from the beginning to look upon themselves as a forlorn hope only placed there to check the progress of the enemy and give them a foretaste of the desperate valour of Greece nor were even oracles wanting to inspire them with enthusiastic ardour It had been declared that to procure the safety of Greece it was necessary that a king one of the descendants of Hercules should die and this task was now cheerfully undertaken by Leonidas who when he marched out of Lacedaemon considered himself as a willing sacrifice offered up for the good of his country  In the mean time Xerxes advanced with his immense army the very sight of which he thought would terrify the Greeks into submission without his being obliged to strike a single blow Great therefore was his surprize when he found that a few desperate men were determined to dispute his passage through the straits of Thermopylae At first be could not believe they would persevere in their resolution and he therefore gave them four days  to reflect on their danger hoping they would at last think it most prudent to retire But when he found them remain immoveable in their post he sent them a summons to deliver up their arms Leonidas with a true Spartan contempt desired him  "to come and take them"  And when some people said that the Persian forces were so numerous that their very darts would darken the sun  "Then" replied Dieneces a Spartan "we shall fight in the shade"  Xerxes provoked at these sarcasms resolved to begin the attack immediately The first assault was made by a body of Medes but these were instantly repulsed with great slaughter A body of ten thousand Persians commonly known by the name of the immortal band made another attempt to dislodge the Grecians but with no better success than the former In a word the Greeks maintained their ground against the whole power of the Persian army for two days together and would probably have maintained it much longer had it not been for the treachery of Epialtes a Trachinian who having deserted to the enemy conducted a body of twenty thousand Persians through a bypath to the top of a mountain that overhung the straits  Leonidas seeing the enemy in this situation plainly perceived that his post was no longer tenable He therefore advised his allies to retire and reserve themselves for better times and the future safety of Greece As for himself and his fellowSpartans they were obliged by their laws not to fly that he owed a life to his country and that it was now his duty to fall in its defence Thus having dismissed all but his three hundred Spartans with some Thespians and Thebans in all not a thousand men he exhorted his followers in the most cheerful manner to prepare for death  "Come my fellow soldiers" says he "let us dine cheerfully here for tonight we shall sup with Pluto"  His men upon  hearing his determined purpose set up a loud shout as if they had been invited to a banquet and resolved every man to sell his life as dearly as he could The night now began to advance and this was thought the most glorious opportunity of meeting death in the enemy's camp where darkness by hiding the smallness of their numbers would fill the Persians with greater consternation Thus resolved they made directly to the Persian tents and in the silence of the night had almost penetrated to the royal pavilion with hopes of surprising the king The obscurity added much to the horror of the scene and the Persians incapable of distinguishing friend from foe fell furiously upon each other and rather assisted than opposed the Greeks Thus success seemed to crown the rashness of their enterprize until the morning beginning to dawn the light soon discovered the smallness of their numbers They were soon therefore surrounded by the Persian forces who fearing to fall in upon them flung their javelins from every quarter till the Greeks not so much conquered as tired with conquering fell amidst heaps of the slaughtered enemy leaving behind them an example of courage to which there is no parallel to be found in history Leonidas was one of the first that fell and the endeavours of the Lacedaemonians to defend his dead body were incredible It was found after the battle buried under a mountain of the dead and was nailed to a cross by way of infamy by the brutal victor Of all the train two only escaped whose names were Aristodemus and Panites The latter was treated with such contempt on his return to Sparta that he killed himself in despair Aristodemus recovered his lost honour by his gallant behaviour at the battle of Plataea The loss of the Persians on this occasion is supposed to have amounted to twenty thousand men among which were two of the king's brothers  The very day on which the battle of Thermopylae was fought there was a naval engagement between the fleets of Greece and Persia in which the former took or sunk thirty of the enemy's ships and forced a hundred and seventy of them to sea where by stress of weather they were all soon after either sunk or stranded  Xerxes however having now passed the straits found nothing capable of opposing his progress in the open country and he therefore directed his march towards Athens on which he was determined to take a signal vengeance Themistocles seeing the impossibility of defending this place used all his eloquence and address in persuading his countrymen to abandon it for the present and this he was at last able though with no little difficulty to effect A decree was therefore passed by which it was ordained that Athens for awhile should be given up in trust to the Gods and that all the inhabitants whether in freedom or slavery should go on board the fleet The young and adventurous set sail for Salamis the old the women and children took shelter at Trezene the inhabitants of which generously offered them an asylum But in this general desertion of the city that which raised the compassion of all was the great number of old men they were obliged to leave in the place on account of their age and infirmities Many also voluntarily remained behind believing that the citadel which they had fortified with wooden walls was what the oracle pointed out for general safety To heighten this scene of distress the matrons were seen cling  ng with fond affection to the places where they had  o long resided the women filled the streets with  amentations and even the poor domestic animals  eemed to take a part in the general concern It was impossible to see these poor creatures run howl  ng and crying after their masters who were going  on shipboard without being strongly affected Among these the faithfulness of a particular dog is recorded who jumped into the sea after his master and continued swimming as near as he could to the vessel till he landed at Salamis and died the moment after upon the shore  Those few inhabitants that remained behind retired into the citadel where literally interpreting the oracle they fortified it as well as they could and patiently awaited the approach of the invader Nor was it long before they saw him arrive at their gates and summon them to surrender This however they refused to do or even to listen to any terms he proposed to them The place was therefore taken by assault all who were found in it were put to the sword and the citadel was reduced to ashes  But though the confederates had been thus obliged to abandon Athens to the fury of the enemy they were by no means disposed to let them overrun the whole country They took possession of Peloponnesus built a wall across the isthmus that joined it to the continent and committed the defence of that important post to Cleombrotus the brother of Leonidas In adopting this measure they were all of them unanimous as being the most prudent that could be embraced The case was not the same with regard to the operations of the fleet Eurybiades was for bringing it into the neighbourhood of the isthmus that so the sea and land forces might act in conjunction Themistocles was of a quite different opinion and maintained that it would be the height of folly to abandon so advantageous a post as that of Salamis where they were now stationed They were now he said in possession of the narrow seas where the number of the enemy's ships could never avail them that the only hope now left the Athenians was their fleet and that  this must not capriciously be given up by ignorance to the enemy Eurybiades who considered himself as glanced at could not contain his resentment but was going to strike Themistocles for his insolence  "Strike me" cried the Athenian "strike me but hear me"  His moderation and his reasoning prevailed and it was therefore resolved to await the enemy's fleet at Salamis Fearful however that the confederates might change their mind Themistocles had recourse to one of those stratagems which mark superior genius He contrived to have it privately intimated to Xerxes that the confederates were now assembled at Salamis preparing for flight and that it would be an easy matter to attack and destroy them The artifice succeeded Xerxes gave orders to his fleet to block up Salamis by night in order to prevent an escape that would have baffled his views of vengeance  Even Themistocles himself was not sensible for some time of the success of his scheme and of his seemingly dangerous situation Aristides who then commanded a small body of troops at Egina no sooner heard it than ignorant of the real cause of all these manoeuvres and actually thinking Themistocles in danger he ventured in a small boat by night through the whole fleet of the enemy Upon landing he made up to the tent of Themistocles and addressed him in the following manner  "If we are wise Themistocles we shall henceforth lay aside all those frivolous and puerile dissensions which have hitherto divided us One strife and a noble one it is now remains for us which of us shall be most serviceable to our country It is your's to command as a general it is mine to obey as a subject and happy shall I be if my advice can any way contribute to your and my country's glory"  He then informed him of the fleet's real situation and warmly exhorted him to give battle without delay  Themistocles felt all that gratitude which so generous and disinterested a conduct deserved and eager to make a proper return he immediately let him into all his schemes and projects particularly this last of suffering himself to be blocked up After this they exerted their joint influence with the other commanders to persuade them to engage and accordingly both fleets prepared themselves for battle  The Grecian fleet consisted of three hundred and eighty ships the Persian fleet was much more numerous But whatever advantage they had in numbers and the size of their ships they fell infinitely short of the Greeks in their naval skill and their acquaintance with the seas where they fought but it was chiefly on the superior abilities of their commanders that the Greeks placed their hopes of success Eurybiades had nominally the command of the fleet but Themistocles directed all its operations He knowing that a periodical wind which would be favourable would soon set in delayed the attack till that time and this had no sooner arisen than the signal was given for battle and the Grecian fleet sailed forward in exact order  As the Persians now fought under the eye of their sovereign who beheld the action from a neighbouring promontory they exerted themselves for some time with great spirit but their courage abated when they came to a closer engagement The numerous disadvantages of their circumstances and situation then began to appear The wind blew directly in their faces the height and heaviness of their vessels rendered them unwieldy and useless and even the number of their ships in the narrow sea only served to embarrass and perplex them The Ionians were the first that fled the Phoenicians and Cyprians were soon after driven on shore and  in a little time their whole fleet was thrown into confusion In the general consternation which this occasioned Artemisia queen of Halicarnassus who had come to the assistance of Xerxes with five ships exerted herself with so much spirit that that monarch was heard to say that his soldiers behaved like women in the conflict and the women like soldiers Nothing however could repair the disorder that had now taken place in the Persian fleet They instantly fled on all sides some of them were sunk and more taken above two hundred were burnt and all the rest were entirely dispersed  Such was the issue of the battle of Salamis in which the Persians received a more severe blow than any they had hitherto experienced from Greece Themistocles is said to have been so elated with this victory that he proposed breaking down the bridge on the Hellespont and thus cutting off the retreat of the enemy but from this he was dissuaded by Aristides who represented the great danger of reducing so powerful an army to despair Xerxes however seems to have been so apprehensive of some such step being taken that after leaving about three hundred thousand of his best troops behind him under Mardonius not so much with a view of conquering Greece as in order to prevent a pursuit he hastened back with the rest to the Hellespont where finding the bridge broken down by the violence of the waves he was obliged to pass over in a small boat and this manner of leaving Europe when compared to his ostentatious method of entering it rendered his disgrace the more poignant and afflicting  CHAP VI FROM THE RETREAT OF XERXES OUT OF GREECE TO THE BATTLE OF MYCALE  A M  NOTHING could exceed the joy of the Greeks upon the victory they had obtained at Salamis It was a custom among them after a battle for the commanding officers to declare who had distinguished themselves most by writing the names of such as merited the first and second rewards On this occasion each officer concerned adjudged the first rank to himself but all allowed the second to Themistocles which was in fact allowing him a tacit superiority This was farther confirmed by the Lacedaemonians who carried him in triumph to Sparta and who having adjudged the reward of valour to their own countryman Eurybiades adjudged that of wisdom to Themistocles They crowned him with olive presented him with a rich chariot and conducted him with three hundred horse to the confines of their state But there was an homage paid him that flattered his pride yet more when he appeared at the Olympic games that is before all the states of Greece assembled the spectators received him with uncommon acclamations As soon as he appeared the whole assembly rose up to do him honour nobody regarded either the games or the combatants Themistocles was the only object worth their attention Struck with such flattering honours he could not help crying out that he that day reaped the fruits of all his labours  Mardonius having passed the winter in Thessaly led his forces in the spring into the province of Boeotia and from thence sent Alexander king of  Macedonia with very tempting proposals to the Athenians hoping by that means to detach them from the general interests of Greece He offered to rebuild their city to present them with a considerable sum of money to allow them to enjoy their laws and liberties and to bestow upon them the government of all Greece The Spartans were afraid that the Athenians might be apt to accept of these proposals and they therefore sent ambassadors to Athens in order to dissuade them from so base a conduct But Aristides who was then chief Archon of Athens needed no other monitor than the dictates of his own heart Receiving Alexander and the ambassadors at the same time he addressed them in the following terms  "For men" said he "bred up in pleasure and ignorance it is natural to proffer great rewards and to hope by bribes to undermine virtue Barbarians who make silver and gold the chief object of their esteem may be excused for thinking to corrupt the fidelity of a free people but that the Lacedaemonians who came to remonstrate against these offers should suppose they could prevail is indeed surprising The Athenians have the common liberty of Greece entrusted to their care and mountains of gold are not able to shake their fidelity No so long as that  un which the Persians adore continues to shine with wonted splendor so long shall the Athenians be mortal enemies to the Persians so long shall they continue to pursue them for ravaging their  ands for burning their houses and polluting their templesSuch is the answer we return to the Persian proposalAnd you" continued he addressing himself to Alexander "if you are really their friend refrain for the future from being the bearer of such proposals your honour and perhaps even your safety demands it"  Mardonius provoked at the rejection of hi  offers invaded Attica which the Athenians unabl  to resist the torrent were once more obliged to abandon to his fury Nothing however could reconcile that people to any terms of accommodation They even stoned Lycidas a senator to death for proposing a submission and his wife and children met with the same fate from the women▪ In the mean time the Spartans were in danger of falling into the same error from which they had been so anxious to preserve the Athenians I mean that of consulting their own private safety without regarding the general interests of Greece They proposed to fortify the isthmus of Peloponnesus But the Athenians remonstrating against so partial and ungenerous a proceeding the Spartans readily gave up the point  The Grecian army was now assembled to the number of seventy thousand men Of these five thousand were Spartans attended by thirtyfive thousand Helots The Athenians amounted to eight thousand and the troops of the allies made up the rest With this army the Greeks resolved to oppose Mardonius though at the head of no less than three hundred thousand men That general fearing to be attacked in the hilly country of Attica where he could not avail himself of his great superiority of numbers had lately returned into Boeotia and encamped his troops on the banks of the river Asopus Thither he was pursued by the Grecians but as neither side could begin the attack without encountering great disadvantages the two armies continued in sight of each other for the space of ten days both of them equally eager for a battle and yet both afraid to strike the first blow  It was during this interval that a mutiny had like to have arisen in the Grecian army about the post of honour All parties allowed the Spartans  he command of the right wing but the Tegaeans  lledged that they were better entitled by their past  ervices to the command of the left than the Athe  ians who now occupied it This dissension might  ave produced very fatal effects had it not been for  he moderation and magnanimity of Aristides who  ommanded the Athenians and who addressed him  lf to the Spartans and the rest of the confederates  n the following manner  "It is not now a time my friends to dispute about the merit of past ser  ioes for all boasting is vain in the day of danger  et it be the brave man's pride to own that it is  ot the post or station which gives courage or which can take it away I head the Athenians whatever post you shall assign us we will maintain  and will endeavour to make our station wherever  e are placed the post of true honour and military  ory We are come hither not to contend with  ur friends but to fight with our enemies not to  oast of our ancestors but to imitate them This  attle will distinguish the merit of each city each  ommander and the lowest sentinel will share the  onour of the day"  This speech determined the  ouncil of war in favour of the Athenians who  ereupon were allowed to maintain their former  ation  Meanwhile the Grecians beginning to be  raitened for want of water resolved to retreat to a  ace where they might be more plentifully supplied  ith that necessary article As their removal was  ade in the night much disorder ensued and in  e morning Mardonius construing their retreat  to a flight immediately pursued them and com  g up with them near the little city of Plataea he  tacked them with great impetuosity His ardour  owever was soon checked by the Spartans who  ought up the rear of the Grecian army and who  rowing themselves into a phalanx stood impenetrable  and immoveable to all the assaults of the enemy At the same time the Athenians being informed of the attack quickly turned back and after defeating a body of Greeks in Persian pay they came to the assistance of the Spartans just as these last had completed the overthrow of the enemy For Mardonius enraged at seeing his men give way rushed into the thickest of the ranks in order to restore the battle and while he was doing so he was killed by Aimnestus a Spartan Upon this the whole army betook themselves to flight Artabazis with a body of forty thousand men fled towards the Hellespont the rest retreated to their camp and there endeavoured to defend themselves with wooden ramparts But these being quickly broken down the confederates rushed in upon them with irresistible fury and eager to rid their country of such terrible invaders they sternly refused them all quarter and put upwards of a hundred thousand of them to the sword Thus ended the invasion of the Persians into Greece nor ever after was an army from Persia seen to cross the Hellespont We have already observed that Aristides commanded the Athenians in this important action The Spartans were headed by Cleombrotus and Pausanias a Lacedaemonian was the chief commander  The battle was no sooner over than the Greeks to testify their gratitude to heaven caused a statue of Jupiter to be m  d  at the public expence and placed it in his t  mple at Olympia On the right side of the pedes  l were engraved the names of the several nations of Greece that were present in the engagement The Spartans had the first place the Athenians the second and all the rest succeeded in order  The successes of the Greeks were as rapid as they were important On the very evening of the day  on which the victory at Plataea was won another equally glorious was obtained at Mycale on the coast of Ionia After the defeat at Salamis the remains of the Persian fleet retired to Samos but the Greeks were not long in pursuing them The confederates on this occasion were headed by Leocychides the Spartan and Xanthippus the Athenian The Persians were no sooner informed of their approach than conscious of their own inferiority by sea they drew up their ships upon dry land at My  ale and fortified them with a wall and a deep  rench while they were at the same time protected by an army of sixty thousand men under the command of Tigranes But nothing could secure them from the fury of the Grecians who immediately  oming on shore and dividing themselves into two  odies the Athenians and Corinthians advanced di  ectly on the plain while the Lacedaemonians fetch  d a compass over hills and precipices in order to  ake possession of a rising ground But before these  t arrived the former had entirely put the enemy  o flight and now being joined by the Spartans  hey soon forced their way through the Persian ram  arts and set all their ships on fire so that nothing  ould be more complete than the victory now ob  i  ed Tigranes the Persian general with forty  housand of his men lay dead upon the field of  a  ie the fleet was destroyed and of the great  my which Xerxes brought into Europe scarce a  ng  e man remained to carry back to him the news  f its defeat  CHAP VII FROM THE VICTORY AT MYCALE TO THE PEACE CONCLUDED BETWEEN THE GREEKS AND PERSIANS  A M  NO sooner were the Greeks freed from the apprehensions of a foreign foe than they began to entertain jealousies of each other and the first symptoms of this dangerous spirit appeared in a misunderstanding that took place between the Athenians and Spartans The former with their families being returned to their own country began to think of rebuilding the city and as its late state of weakness had rendered it so easy a prey to the Persians they now formed a plan for strengthening and extending the walls and giving it for the future a greater degree of security This excited the jealousy of the Lacedaemonians who could not bear to see any of the other states of Greece upon an equal footing with themselves They therefore sent ambassadors to dissuade the Athenians from this undertaking but being ashamed to avow thei  real motive they alledged the great detriment which these fortifications would be of to the general interests of Greece if ever they should fall into the hands of the enemy Themistocles who then guided all the councils of Athens at once saw through their design and resolved to meet their duplicity with equal dissimulation He therefore told them that the Athenians would soon send an embassy to Sparta and fully satisfy all their scruples and having procured himself to be chosen for this purpose he accordingly went thither and by studied delays kept the Spartans in suspence until the works were completely finished He then boldly  threw off the mask and declared that Athens was now in a condition to keep out any enemy either foreign or domestic and that what she had done was perfectly consistent with the laws of nations and the common interests of Greece He further added that if any violence were offered to his person the Athenians would retaliate upon the Spartan ambassadors who were now in their hands in consequence of which the ambassadors on both sides were suffered quietly  depart and Themistocles upon his arrival in  ns was received as if he had been returning from a triumph  Encouraged by his success in this undertaking Themistocles projected another scheme far less justifiable indeed for increasing the power and importance of his country This scheme however he declared in a full assembly of the people would not admit of being publicly mentioned as its execution required secrecy and dispatch He therefore begged that some person might be appointed to whom he might communicate his design one who was qualified to judge at once of the utility and the practicability of the project Aristides was pitched upon for this purpose To him Themistocles privately signified his intention of burning the fleet belonging to the rest of the Grecian states which then lay in a neighbouring port and thus rendering Athens the undisputed sovereign of the sea Aristides shocked at so base a proposal made no answer but returning to the assembly informed them that nothing could be more advantageous to Athens than what Themistocles proposed but that nothing at the same time could be more unjust The people adopting the magnanimous sentiments of their magistrate unanimously rejected the proposal without knowing its contents and bestowed upon Aristides the surname of  Just  which he so well deserved  The confederates being thus left at liberty to turn their arms against their foreign foes instead of  drawing their swords against one another fitted out a powerful fleet Pausanias commanded the Spartans the Athenians were conducted by Aristides and Cimon the son of Miltiades They first directed their course to the isle of Cyprus where they set all the cities free Then steering towards the Hellespont they attacked the city of Byzantium of which they made themselves masters and besides the vast quantity of plunder which they found in it they took a great number of prisoners many of whom were of the richest and most considerable families of Persia  But whatever the Greeks gained upon this occasion in fame and authority they lost in the purity and simplicity of their manners The deluge of wealth poured in upon them from this quarter naturally tended to corrupt their morals and from this time forward neither the magistrates nor the people valued themselves as formerly on their personal merit but merely on account of their riches and possessions The Athenians being a polite people bore this change for some time with tolerable moderation but the contagion▪ immediately broke out among the Spartans with all its native virulence It seems to have inspired Pausanias who was naturally of a haughty and imperious temper and who had forfeited the good opinion not only of the neighbouring states but also of his own subjects with the ambitious hopes of raising himself to a still higher rank than he had yet attained He offered to deliver up Sparta and even all Greece to Xerxes provided that prince would give him his daughter in marriage How long this conspiracy was carried on is uncertain Pausanias was twice t  ied and twice acquitted for want of sufficient evidence against him His guilt however became at length too apparent to be any longer concealed but just as the Ephon were upon the point of seizing  him he took refuge in the temple of Minerva where the sanctity of the place preventing his being dragged forth the people blocked up the entry with large stones and tearing off the roof left him in that manner to die of cold and hunger This he in a little time did and thus perished the man who had led on the victorious troops of Greece in the battle of Plataea  The fate of Pausanias soon after involved that of Themistocles who had some time before been banished and lived in great esteem at Argos The occasion of his banishment was this He had built near his house a temple in honour of Diana with this inscription  "To Diana the goddess of good counsel"  thereby insinuating the benefit his own counsels had been of to his country and the little gratitude his fellowcitizens had shewn in rewarding them He was now accused not only of having been privy to the designs of Pausanias without revealing them to the state which part of the charge indeed seems to have been well founded but likewise of having approved and favoured those designs a crime it would appear of which he was altogether guiltless The Spartans however who had always been his enemies now declared themselves his accusers before the assembly of the people of Athens and all those of his countrymen who had formerly either dreaded his power or envied his popularity joined in the general charge against him In a word the people were wrought up to such a degree of rage that they clamoured for his death with great vehemence and persons were actually sent to seize and bring him before the general council of Greece Fortunately however he had notice of their design and saved himself by a precipitate flight He first took refuge in the island of Corcyra From thence he repaired to the court of Admetus king of the Molossians but that prince  not being able to afford him any long or certain protection he at last went over to Sardis where throwing himself prostrate before the Persian monarch he boldly declared his name his country and his misfortunes  "I have done" cried he "my ungrateful country services more than once and I am now come to offer those services to you My life is in your hands you may now exert your clemency or display your vengeance By the former you will preserve a faithful suppliant by the latter you will destroy the greatest enemy of Greece"  The king made him no answer at this audience though he was struck with admiration at his eloquence and intrepidity but he soon gave a loose to his joy for the event He told his courtiers that he considered the arrival of Themistocles as a very happy incident and wished that his enemies would always pursue the same destructive policy of banishing from among them the good and wise His joys were continued in a dream In the night he was seen to start from his sleep and three times to cry out  "I have got Themistocles the Athenian"  He even gave him three cities for his support and had him maintained in the utmost affluence and splendor It is said that such was his interest at the Persian court and so great was the estimation in which he was held by all ranks of people that one day at table he was heard to cry out to his wife and children who sat near him  "Children we should certainly have been ruined if we had not formerly been undone"  But nothing could eraze from the breast of Themistocles the love he entertained for his country Indeed the spirit of patriotism appears to have prevailed among the Greeks in a higher degree than ever it did among any other people This was no doubt owing to the many violent struggles they had been obliged to make in defence of their country  And perhaps it will be found that the value we set upon any thing is always in proportion to the pains we have taken in acquiring or preserving it When Xerxes therefore proposed fitting out an expedition against Athens and entrusting the command of it to Themistocles that patriot rather than carry arms against the place of his nativity put an end to his own life by poison  In the mean time Aristides instead of incurring the jealousy of his countrymen by his ambitious and interested views continued every day to acquire a larger share of their esteem and veneration by his integrity and love of justice So great indeed was his character in this respect that when it was deliberated among the states of Greece who was the most proper person to be intrusted with the care of the public treasure for carrying on the war all eyes were fixed upon him as the most upright man to be found in the country and his discharge of this important office to which he was immediately appointed only served to confirm the high opinion the world already entertained of him His merit besides in this particular was so much the greater as he himself was extremely poor but it appeared from the following incident that he was voluntarily poor and might have been richer if he had chosen it Callias an intimate friend and relation of his being summoned before the judges for some offence one of the chief objections urged against him was that while he rolled in affluence and luxury he suffered his friend and relation Aristides to remain in poverty and want But Callias appealing to Aristides himself it appeared that he had generously offered to share his fortune with him which the other had absolutely refused to accept asserting that he only might be said to want who permitted his appetites to transgress the bounds of his income and that he who could dispense with a few things  thus rendered himself more like the gods that want for nothing  In this manner he lived just in his public and independent in his private capacity and universally esteemed and beloved by all that knew him History does not acquaint us with the time or place of his death but it bears the most glorious testimony to his character in telling us that he who had had the absolute disposal of the public treasures died poor It is even asserted that he did not leave money enough behind him to defray the expence of his funeral but that the government was obliged to bear the charge of it and to maintain his family His daughters were portioned and his son subsisted at the expence of the public and some of his grandchildren were supported by a pension equal to that bestowed upon those who had been victorious at the Olympic games  The first man that began to make a figure at Athens after the death of Themistocles and Aristides was Cimon the son or Miltiades In his earlier years he had led a very dissolute life but Aristides perceiving in him amidst all his dissipation the seeds of many great and good qualities advised him to change his conduct and to raise his mind from the pursuit of low and ignoble pleasures to the ambition of directing the affairs of the state He did so and in a little time became equal to his father in courage to Themistocles in sagacity and even not much inferior to his instructor himself in integrity The first specimen he gave of his military talents was in scouring the Asiatic seas and delivering all the Greek cities on the coasts of Asia Minor from their dependence upon the Persian crown and making them join in the general confederacy of Greece against that very power to which they had formerly acknowledged allegiance Some of these however that were strongly garrisoned by  Persian troops made a desperate defence The city of Eion deserves to be particularly mentioned Boges the governor resolved either to preserve it or to perish in the attempt He accordingly defended the place with incredible fury till finding his station no longer tenable he killed his wife and children and laying them on a funeral pile which he had erected for the purpose he immediately set it on fire and rushing into the midst of the flames in that manner expired  While Cimon was employed in these operations he received intelligence that the whole Persian fleet was anchored at the mouth of the river Eurymidon He accordingly sailed thither and pursuing the enemy up the stream where they endeavoured to take shelter he destroyed all their ships and his men jumping on shore in pursuit of the Persian mariners who had abandonded their vessels they soon put them to flight thus obtaining a complete victory both by sea and land on the same occasion This severe blow at last compelled the Persians to agree to a peace the terms of which were as mortifying to them as they were honourable to the Grecians It was stipulated that the Greek cities in Asia should be left in quiet possession of their liberty and that neither the sea nor land forces of Persia should approach so near the Grecian coasts as to give the least occasion for any kind of jealousy  The treasures taken in this expedition Cimon laid out in beautifying his native city and the Athenians gave examples in the art of architecture that continue to be admired to this very day About the same time lived the poet Simonides some of whose works still remain and these only leave us room to regret that the rest are long since irretrievably lost  CHAP VIII FROM THE PEACE WITH PERSIA TO THE PEACE OF NICIAS  THOUGH Cimon was for some time after the death of Aristides the most considerable man at Athens he did not remain long without a rival He was soon opposed by Pericles who was much younger than he and was a man of a very different character Pericles was descended from the greatest and most illustrious families of Athens his father Xanthippus defeated the Persians at Mycale and his mother Agarista was niece to Calisthenes who expelled the tyrants and established a popular government in Athens In the earlier part of his life he applied himself with success to all the different branches of philosophy but the chief bent of his mind was directed to the study of eloquence in which he is said to have outshone all his contemporaries Even his great opponent Thucydides was often heard to say that though he had frequently overthrown him the power of his eloquence was such that the audience could never perceive him fallen He resembled the tyrant Pisistratus not only in the sweetness of his voice but the features of his face and his whole air and manner To these natural and acquired endowments he added those of fortune he was very rich and intimately connected with all the most powerful families of the state  The established reputation of Cimon however was for some time a bar to the rise of Pericles but as the former was generally abroad commanding the fleets or armies of the country and the latter was always at home haranguing and making interest  with the people he soon found means to overcome this obstacle The first use he made of his popularity was to lessen the power and consequently the character of the court of Areopagus This he did chiefly by the assistance of one Ephialtes another popular leader who contrived to take away the decision of almost all causes from that celebrated tribunal and to bring them before the assembly of the people Cimon's interest however was still able to counteract and even to overpower that of Pericles in a very important question This was whether the Athenians should assist the Lacedaemonians in suppressing an insurrection of their Helots or slaves who had taken up arms to rescue themselves from bondage Cimon gave his opinion in the affirmative Pericles in the negative But Cimon's opinion as being the most generous was for this time adopted and he was allowed to conduct a large body of troops to Sparta with which he effectually quelled the insurrection But the Helots taking up arms a second time and possessing themselves of the strong fortress of Ithome the Spartans were once more obliged to apply to Athens for assistance The influence however of Pericles now prevailed in its turn and all kind of aid was denied them Thus left to finish the war by themselves they besieged Ithome which held out for ten years at the end of which however they made themselves masters of it though they spared the lives of those who defended it upon condition of their leaving Peloponnesus for ever  The conduct of the Athenians upon this occasion and some insults they pretended to have received from the Lacedaemonians revived a jealousy that had long subsisted between these rival states and which continued thenceforward to operate with greater or less influence till both of them were reduced to such a low ebb of power that neither of them was able to withstand the slightest invasion  from abroad The first instance the Athenians gave of their resentment was to banish Cimon who had been a favourer of the Spartan cause for ten years from the city They next dissolved their alliance with Sparta and entered into a treaty with the Argives the professed enemies of the former The slaves banished from Peloponnesus were taken under the protection of Athens and settled with their families at Naupactus and all the privileges or Spartan subjects were demanded in behalf of those Athenians that resided in Lacedaemon But what contributed to widen the breach still more the city of Megara breaking off its alliance with Sparta was protected and garrisoned by the Athenians and thus was laid the foundation of an inveterate hatred that terminated in the destruction of both these states  The chief motive to this insolent and treacherous conduct of the Athenians was the high opinion they entertained of themselves ever since the battle of Plataea That victory had raised them to the same national eminence with the Lacedaemonians But they were nor satisfied with being their equals they wanted to be their superiors They therefore called themselves the  Protectors of Greece  they desired that the convention of the states should be held at Athens and they resolved to declare open war against any power that should dare to insult them  Exasperated however as these two states were against each other they did not immediately come to rupture They first endeavoured to strengthen themselves by leagues and alliances with the neighbouring states At last the armies of the two republics came to an engagement near Tangara and though Cimon forgetting the injury he had received fr  m his country came to its assistance yet the Athenians suffered a defeat A month or two after  another action happened and the Athenians were in their turn victorious The conduct of Cimon upon this occasion reestablished him in the public favour he was restored to his country after a banishment of five years and his rival Pericles was the first that proposed the decree for his recall  Cimon's first care after his return was to compromise all differences between the rival states and this was so far outwardly effected that a truce was concluded for the space of five years This furnished an opportunity for exerting the power of the state upon a more distant enemy A fleet of two hundred sail was fitted out and the command of it given to Cimon for conquering the island of Cyprus He accordingly sailed thither overran the island and laid siege to the capital Citium But being either wounded by some of the defendants or wasted by sickness he began to perceive the approaches of death Still mindful however of his duty he ordered his attendants to conceal his decease till their schemes were crowned with success They did so and thirty days after he was dead the army which still supposed itself under his command obliged the place to surrender Thus he not only died in the arms of victory but he even gained battles by the terror of his name In so great awe indeed did the Persians stand of him that they universally deserted the seacoasts and would not come within four hundred leagues of any place where he could possibly be expected  Pericles being now freed from the opposition of so powerful a rival resolved to complete the work of ambition he had begun and by dividing the conquered lands among the people amusing them with shows and adorning the city with public buildings be at last acquired such an ascendancy over the minds of the populace that he may actually be said to have been possessed of sovereign power in a free state  The buildings indeed which he raised have endeared his memory to all the lovers of the fine arts Some small remains of them are still to be seen and these are allowed by the best judges to be so perfect in their kind that they have never since been excelled and hardly ever equalled True it is that to complete these works he was guilty in some measure of injustice for he applied to this purpose part of the money that had been raised by the different states of Greece for carrying on the war against Persia but when any of these states complained of this embezzlement of the public treasure Pericles boldly replied that the Athenians were not accountable to any for their conduct and that they had the best right to the treasures of the confederate states who took the greatest care to defend them He added that it was fit that ingenious artizans should have their share of the public money since there was still enough left for carrying on the war  These arguments however were by no means sufficient to satisfy the other states of Greece and least of all the Spartans who beheld the present prosperity of Athens with envy and the insolence of Pericles with indignation And these passions were still further inflamed by an expedition which the Athenians undertook against Samos in favour of the Milesians who had craved their assistance It is said that Pericles fomented this war to please a famous courtezan named Aspasia of whom he was particularly enamoured After several skirmishes not worth mentioning Pericles besieged the capital of Samos with tortoises and battering rams which was the first time these military engines had been employed in sieges The Samians after sustaining a nine months siege surrendered Pericles razed their walls dispossessed them of their ships and exacted immense sums for defraying the expences  of the war Elated with this success he returned to Athens buried all those who had fallen in the most splendid manner and pronounced their funeral oration  Though the jealousy and rivalship that subsisted between Athens and Sparta was the true cause of the Peloponnesian war yet neither of them was willing to avow their real motive a petty quarrel among the inferior states of Greece their allies furnished them with an ostensible reason The Corcyreans resenting the conduct of the Corinthians with regard to one of their dependent colonies named Epidamnus took up arms to revenge the affront but being worsted in some naval engagements they had recourse to the Athenians for support who sent them some naval succours which however were of no great service From this war arose another for Potidaea a city belonging to Athens declaring for Corinth these two states immediately came to a rupture and drawing their forces into the field near Potidaea a battle ensued in which the Athenians gained the victory It was in this battle that Socrates saved the life of Alcibiades his pupil and after the battle was over procured him the prize of valour which he himself more justly deserved The city of Potidaea was soon after besieged in consequence of this victory and the Corinthians complained to the states of Greece against the Athenians as having infringed the articles of peace The Lacedaemonians gave them an audience and after hearing what the Athenians had to urge in reply they came to a resolution that the Athenians were the aggressors and ought to be reduced to a sense of their duty  To give a colour of justice however to their proceedings they began by sending ambassadors to Athens and while they made preparations for acting with vigour they still kept up a shew of seeking  redress by treaty They required the Athenian to expel from their city some persons that had bee  guilty of profaning the temple of Minerva at Cey+lon they demanded that the siege of Potidaea shoul  be raised and that the Athenians should cease fo  the future to encroach upon the liberties of Greece  Pericles now saw that as he had drawn his cour+trymen into a war he ought to inspire them wit  courage to support it He accordingly shews them that even trifles extorted from them with a air of command were in themselves a sufficien  ground for war that they might hope to deriv  considerable advantage from the divided councils o  their opponents that they had shipping to invad  the enemy's coasts and that their city being wel  fortified could not easily be taken The people in+fluenced by the force of his eloquence naturally fon  of change and unterrified by distant dangers readil  came into his opinion but in order to meet th  duplicity of the Spartans with equal address they re+turned an evasive answer declaring that they wish+ed for nothing more than to settle all differences i  an amicable manner but that if they were attack+ed they would defend themselves with their wont+ed valour  Pericles is thought to have had a personal inte+rest in hurrying his countrymen into this unhapp  quarrel He was deeply indebted to the state an  knew that a time of peace was the only opportunit  in which he could be called upon to account for hi  management of the public treasure It is said th  Alcibiades his nephew seeing him one day ver  pensive and asking the reason was answered th  he was considering how to make up his accounts  "You had better" said he "consider how t  avoid being accountable"  Besides this Pericle  finding no happiness in domestic society gave himself up to the allurements of his mistress Aspasia  whose wit and vivacity had captivated all the poets and philosophers of the age Socrates himself not excepted She was inclined to oppose the Spartan state and he in some measure is thought to have been guided by her counsels  A M  A war between the two principal states of Greece naturally drew all the inferior ones into the quarrel and these chose their party as interest inclination or ideas of justice led them The majority declared in favour of the Lacedaemonians who were considered as the deliverers of Greece On their side were ranged the Achaians the inhabitants of Pellene excepted the people of Megara Locris Boeotia Phocis Ambracia Leucadia and Anactorium On the side of Athens were the people of Chios Lesbos Plataea many of the islands and several maritime tributary states including those of Thrace Potidaea excepted  The Lacedaemonians were not long in taking the field Their army including their allies amounted to sixty thousand men and was commanded by Archidamus one of their kings The forces of the Athenians were not near so numerous These did not exceed thirteen thousand heavyarmed soldiers sixteen thousand inhabitants twelve hundred horse and about double that number of archers Unable therefore to meet the enemy in the field Pericles advised them to shut themselves up in the city which could not easily be stormed This advice at first was but very ill relished but at last necessity compelled them to adopt it Removing therefore all their valuable effects out of the open country which they abandoned to the mercy of the enemy they took refuge within their walls where they seemed determined to defend themselves to the last extremity To compensate however for the weakness of the land army they had a great superiority  over the Spartans in their naval force This consisted of three hundred ships and with these they continually infested and plundered the enemy's coasts and raised contributions sufficient for defraying the expences of the war  In the mean time the Lacedaemonians entered the country of Attica at Oenone and meeting with no opposition marched forward to Acharne within seven miles of Athens The Athenians enraged at the mortification to which they were now exposed turned the edge of their resentment from the enemy and directed it against Pericles whom they regarded as the author of their disgrace They therefore insisted upon being led out into the open field where notwithstanding the inferiority of their numbers they said they would boldly face the enemy But Pericles chose the wiser part He shut up the city gates placed sufficient guards at all the posts around sent out parties of horse to keep the enemy employed and at the same time dispatched a fleet of an hundred sail to infest the coasts of Peloponnesus These expedients had the desired effect The Lacedaemonians finding the place to be altogether impregnable gave up the siege after laying waste the country around and insulting the defenders by their numbers and reproaches To revenge this injury the Athenians in their turn invaded the enemy's country with their whole force and reduced Nisaea a strong seaport with walls reaching as far as Megara Elated with this success they expressed their joy by celebrating funeral games in honour of those who had fallen in battle It was upon this occasion that Pericles delivered his famous funeral oration which has come down to our times and is generally considered as a proof at once of his eloquence and his gratitude  In the beginning of the next year the Lacedaemonians invaded Attica with the same number of forces  as before and the Athenians were once more obliged to take refuge within their walls But a more dreadful calamity than even that of war now began to visit the unhappy Athenians A plague and one of the most terrible that is recorded in history now broke out among them It is said to have begun in Ethiopia whence it descended into Egypt from thence travelled into Libya and Persia and at last broke like a flood upon Athens This pestilence baffled the utmost efforts of art the most robust constitutions were unable to withstand its attacks no skill could obviate nor no remedy dispel the infection The instant a person was seized he was struck with despair which quite disabled him from attempting a cure The humanity of friends was as fatal to themselves as it was useless to the unhappy sufferers The prodigious quantity of baggage which had been removed out of the country into the city increased the calamity Most of the inhabitants for want of better lodging lived in little cottages in which they could scarce breathe while the burning heat of the summer inflamed the malignity of the distemper They were seen confusedly huddled together the dead as well as the living some crawling through the streets some lying along by the sides of fountains whither they had endeavoured to repair to quench the raging thirst which consumed them Their very temples were filled with dead bodies and every part of the city exhibited a dreadful scene of mortality without the least remedy for the present or the least hopes with regard to futurity It seized the people with such violence that they fell one upon another as they passed along the streets It was also attended with such uncommon pestilential vapours that the very beasts and birds of prey though perishing with hunger round the walls of the city would not touch the bodies of those who died of it Even those who  recovered received such a terrible shock from it as affected not only their senses but the very faculties of their mind It effaced the memory of all the occurrences of their past lives and they knew neither themselves not their nearest relations The effects of this disease are described at large by Thucydides who was sick of it himself and he observes among other things that it introduced into the city a more licentious way of living For the people at first had recourse to their gods to avert this judgment but finding they were all equally infected whether they worshipped them or not and that the disease was generally mortal they abandoned themselves at once to despair and riot for since they held their lives but as it were by the day they were resolved to make the most of their time and money The cause of it was generally imputed to Pericles who by drawing such numbers into the city was thought to have corrupted the very air Yet though this was raging within and the enemy wasting the country without he still continued of the same mind as before that they ought not to risk all their fortunes on the event of a battle In the mean time the Lacedaemonians advancing towards the coast laid waste the whole country and returned after having insulted the wretched Athenians already thinned by pestilence and famine  It is not to be supposed that Pericles the reputed author of all these calamities could long escape the popular resentment In fact he began to be as much hated by the people as ever he had been beloved by them and they had actually deposed him from the command of the army though actuated by that fickleness for which they were remarkable they soon reinstated him with more than former authority But he did not live long to enjoy his honours He was seized with the plague and in a  ittle time died of it a man certainly possessed of many great and amiable qualities and hardly addicted to a single vice except that of an inordinate ambition  The most memorable transaction of the following years was the siege of Plataea one of the most famous that is to be found in antiquity on account of the vigorous efforts of both parties but chiefly for the glorious resistance made by the besieged and the stratagems they employed to elude the fury of the assailants The Lacedaemonians besieged this place in the beginning of the third campaign and surrounded it with a strong wall on which to erect their batteringengines The besieged seeing the works begin to rise round them threw up a wooden wall upon the walls of the city in order that they might always outtop the besiegers Thus both walls seemed to vie with each other for superiority till at last the besieged without amusing themselves at this work any longer built another within in the form of a half moon behind which they might retire in case their other works were forced In the mean time the besiegers having mounted their engines of war shook the city wall in a very terrible manner which though it alarmed the citizens did not however discourage them they employed every art that fortification could suggest against the enemy's batteries They caught with ropes the heads of the batteringrams that were played against them and deadened their force with  evers The besiegers finding their attack did not go on successfully and that a new wall was raised against their platform despaired of being able to  ake the place by storm and therefore changed the  iege into a blockade after having in vain attempt  d to set fire to the city which was suddenly quench  d by a shower The city was now surrounded by  brick wall suddenly erected strengthened on each  ide by a deep ditch The whole army was successively  engaged upon this wall and when it was finished they left a guard over half of it the Boeotians offering to guard the other half while the rest of the army returned to Sparta  In this manner the wretched Plataeans were cooped up by a strong wall without any hopes of relief and only awaited the mercy of the conquerors There were now in Plataea but four hundred natives and fourscore Athenians with an hundred and ten women to dress their victuals and no other person whether freeman or slave all the rest having been sent to Athens before the siege At last the inhabitants of Plataea having lost all hopes of succour and being in the utmost want of provisions formed a resolution to cut their way through the enemy Half of them however struck with the greatness of the danger and the boldness of the enterprize entirely lost courage when they came to the execution but the rest who were about two hundred and twenty soldiers persisted in their resolution and effected their escape in the following manner Having taken the height of the wall by counting the rows of bricks that composed it and having made a sufficient number of ladders of a proper length they set out in the middle of a dark night and during a violent storm of wind and rain so that it was hardly possible either to see or hear them Having crossed the first ditch which they did with one of their legs bare in order to prevent their sliding in the mud they advanced to the bottom of the wall and fixing their ladders to it in a place where they knew it to be unguarded a party of them ascended and instantly made themselves masters of the two next towers by killing those that defended them This gave an opportunity to their comrades to follow them undisturbed and as soon as they came up on one side they went down on the other and actually crossed the outer ditch without being  attacked though not entirely without being discovered For while they were coming over the wall one of them happened to throw down a tile from the parapet which alarmed the enemy and their whole army advanced towards the place but the night was so very dark that it was absolutely impossible to distinguish one object from another Nay before they crossed the outer ditch a corps de reserve of three hundred men that were kept for any unforesenn accident came up to them with lighted torches but these instead of discovering them served only to render the enemy visible After passing the ditch they directed their course for some time towards Thebes well knowing the enemy would never pursue them that way as not thinking it possible they should march towards a hostile city but after proceeding about six or seven stadia they turned short towards the mountains and struck into the road to Athens where two hundred and twelve of them actually arrived the rest having returned to the city through fear one archer excepted who was taken on the side of the outer ditch  In the mean time the Plataeans who remained in the city supposing that all their companions had been killed because those who returned to justify themselves affirmed they were sent a herald to demand their dead bodies but being told the true state of the affair he withdrew At the end of the following campaign the Plataeans being in absolute want of provisions and unable to make any farther  esistance surrendered upon condition that they  hould not be punished till they had the benefit of a re  ular trial Five commissioners came for this purpose  rom Sparta and these without charging them with  ny crime barely asked them whether they had done  ny service to the Lacedaemonians and the allies in this  ar The Plataeans were much surprized as well  as puzzled at this question and knew it must have been suggested by the Thebans their professed enemies who had vowed their destruction They therefore put the Lacedaemonians in mind of the services they had done to Greece in general both at the battle of Artemisium and that of Plataea and particularly in Lacedaemonia at the time of the earthquake which was followed by the revolt of their slaves The only reason they assigned for their having joined the Athenians afterwards was to defend themselves from the hostilities of the Thebans against whom they had implored the assistance of the Lacedaemonians to no purpose That if that was imputed to them as a crime which was only their misfortune it ought not however entirely to obliterate the memory of their former services  "Cast your eyes said they on the monuments of your ancestors which you see here to whom we annually pay all the honours which can be rendered to the manes of the dead You thought fit to intrust their bodies with us as we were eyewitnesses of their bravery And yet you will now give up their ashes to their murderers in abandoning us to the Thebans who fought against them at the battle of Plataea Will you enslave a province where Greece recovered its Liberty Will you destroy the temples of those gods to whom you owed the victory On this occasion we may venture to say our interest is inseparable from your glory and you cannot deliver up your ancient friends and benefactors to the unjust hatred of the Thebans without eternal infamy to yourselves"  One would imagine that these arguments would have had a proper effect upon the Lacedaemonians but they were biassed by the answer which the Thebans made and which was expressed in the most haughty and bitter terms and besides they had brought their instructions from Lacedaemon They stood therefore to their firs  question whether the Plataeans had done them any service in this war and making them pass one after another as they severally answered no each was immediately butchered and not one escaped about two hundred were killed in this manner and twentyfive Athenians who were among them met with the same unhappy fate Their wives who had been taken prisoners were made slaves The Thebans afterwards peopled their city with exiles from Megara and Thebes but the next year they demolished it entirely It was in this manner the Lacedaemonians in hopes of reaping great advantages from the Thebans sacrificed the Plataeans to their fury ninetythree years after their first alliance with the Athenians  The Lacedaemonians however were not so elated with this success as to make them unwilling to agree to a peace provided it could be obtained upon honourable terms and several overtures for this purpose were made by their ambassadors but without effect for Cleon who now guided the councils of the Athenians boasted that he would take all the Spartans in the island of Sphacteria within twenty days He accordingly sailed thither in company with Demosthenes the Athenian admiral whose courage and conduct his eloquent descendant of the same name afterwards celebrated and having landed their troops they attacked the enemy with great vigour drove them from post to post and gaining ground perpetually at last forced them to the extremity of the island The Lacedaemonians had stormed a fort that was thought inaccessible There they drew up in order of battle and facing about to that side where alone they imagined they could be attacked they defended themselves like so many lions But a body of troops having clambered over some steep rocks and come upon their rear they were soon obliged to surrender  at discretion They were carried to Athens where they were told they should be allowed to remain in safety till a peace was concluded provided the Lacedaemonians did not invade the Athenian territories for in that case they were informed they should all be put to death This tended greatly to pave the way for a general pacification as the Lacedaemonians were extremely desirous of procuring the release of these men who were some of the chief of the city The war however continued for two or three years longer though without being productive of any remarkable event The Athenians indeed took the island of Cythera but in their turn were defeated by the Lacedaemonians at Dellion At last both nations began to grow weary of a contest that put them to so great an expence without procuring them any solid advantage A truce for a year was therefore concluded between them which afterwards terminated in a more lasting reconciliation This happy event was considerably facilitated by the death of the two generals that commanded their armies and who had hitherto opposed a peace though from very different motives Brasidas the Lacedaemonian was killed in a sally which he was conducting when besieged in Amphipolis and Cleon the Athenian despising an enemy to whom he knew himself superior was set upon unawares and flying for safety was killed by a soldier who happened to meet him Bransidas was possessed of courage and conduct of moderation and integrity and his opposition to a peace seems to have proceeded merely from a true Spartan zeal for the honour of his country Courage indeed seems to have been hereditary in his family as it no doubt was in the whole Spartan nation for when his mother received the news of his death she asked the persons who brought her the intelligence whether he died honourably and when they began to  launch out into encomiums on his gallantry and heroism and to prefer him to all the generals of his time  "yes said she my son was a brave man but Sparta has still many citizens braver than he"  Cleon was a man of a very different character He was rash arrogant obstinate and contentious and though he succeeded in his expedition to Sphacteria he was by no means fitted for war He only made use of it as a cloak for his ill practices and because he could not carry on his other views without it He had indeed a readiness of wit with a kind of law drollery that took with the populace though with better judges it only passed for impudence and buffoonery But what he chiefly depended upon was his eloquence yet even this was of the noisy and boisterous kind and consisted more in the vehemence of his utterance and the violence of his action and gesture than in the elegance of his style or the strength of his reasoning  Matters being now brought into this happy train a peace was concluded in the tenth year of the war between the two states and their confederates for fifty years The chief articles of it were that the sorts should be evacuated and the towns and prisoners restored on both sides This was called the Nician peace because Nicias who was just the reverse of his rival Cleon was the chief instrument in effecting it Besides the tender concern he always entertained for his country he had more particular ends in view in bringing it about He wished by this means to secure his reputation For though he had succeeded in most of the expeditions in which he had been engaged he well knew how much he owed to his good fortune and his cautious management and he did not chuse to risk the fame he had already acquired by any attempts to procure more  CHAP IX FROM THE PEACE OF NICIAS TO THE END OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR  TREATIES of peace however solemn or sincere are but feeble barriers against the interests the inclinations or the prejudices of rival states or even against the ambitious views of those that have the chief direction of their councils This was fatally experienced in the war that notwithstanding their late agreement soon after broke out between the Athenians and Spartans not to promote the welfare or advance the power of either people but merely to gratify the pride and vanity of Alcibiades who was now become the most popular man in Athens Many things contributed to make him so He was as remarkable for the beauty of his person as the endowments of his mind He was descended from one of the greatest families in Athens he was the richest man in the place and his style and manner of living was equal to his income Add to this that though he was frequently drawn into irregularities by the pernicious advice of flatterers with whom he was naturally surrounded and the violence of his own passions which were ever in the extreme yet he was as often recalled from these vicious courses and brought back into the paths of virtue by the salutary counsels of Socrates for whose character he had conceived the highest regard and to whose lessons he always gave the greatest attention  Nor was the philosopher less fond of him that he was of the philosopher For perceiving in him amidst all his irregularties the feeds of many grea  and amiable quailies he was extremely desirou  of cultivating these and bringing them to maturity that so when he grew up instead of being a curse and disgrace he might prove an honour and a blessing to his country And so fully was he convinced of the ascendant he had acquired over the mind of this young man that whenever he heard he was indulging himself in any low or vicious pleasures he would pursue him as a master does a fugitive slave and severely reprimand him for his folly and the other would listen to him with all the submission of a dutiful son to the best of fathers Hence proceeded the inequality of his conduct which was sometimes agreeable to the most rigid rules of morality and at others was marked with all the extravagance of the wildest passions  His ruling passion indeed seems to have been the love of power and a desire of superiority and of this he is said to have given several striking instances even while a boy One day being rather overmatched in wrestling and fearing to be thrown down he got the hand of his antagonist in his mouth and bit it with all his force upon which the other let go is hold and said  "Alcibiades you bite like a woman"    "No replied he I bite like a lion"  At another time when he was playing in the street at some game of chance a loaded cart happenend to come that way when it was his turn to throw At first he called out to the driver to stop because he was going to throw in the road over which the cart was to pass But the fellow did not seem to mind him but still drove on upon which all the rest of the boys divided and made way but Alcibiades throwing himself on his face before the cart and stretching out his limbs bid the carter drive on if he would at which the man was so startled that he put back his horses and Alcibiades was allowed to have his throw before the cart passed His ambition naturally increased with his years and  when he came to be a man like Pompey in later times instead of being able to bear a superior he could not even endure an equal For this reason it was that he set himself in opposition to Nicias who was as much respected by his own countrymen and much more by the Lacedaemonians who esteemed him for his moderation and love of justice And on the same account he conceived an incurable prejudice against the Lacedaemonians themselves for this preference given to his rival and did every thing in his power to excite a quarrel between them and the Athenians  The first step he took for this purpose was to instigate the people of Argos to break with the Lacedaemonians assuring them that if they did so they should soon be supported by the whole power of Athens and the fact is every thing was in a fair way for a treaty between the Athenians and Argives when the Lacedaemonians informed of these negotiations sent ambassadors to Athens in order to remonstrate and invested them with full power to settle all matters in dispute in an amicable manner This commission seemed to satisfy the council to whom it was first communicated and the people were to assemble the next day to give the ambassadors an audience Alcibiades fearing that this would mar his schemes had recourse to the following artifice He contrived to have a private conference with the ambassadors and persuaded them under colour of friendship not to let the people know at first what full powers they possessed but merely to intimate that they came to treat and make proposals for that otherwise the people would grow exorbitant in their demands and endeavour to extort from them such unreasonable terms as they could not with honour consent to The stratagem succeeded The ambassadors believing him sincere withdrew their confidence from  Nicias and reposed it in him and the next day when the people were assembled and the ambassadors introduced Alcibiades with a very obliging air demanded of them with what powers they were come They made answer that they were not come as plenipotentiaries Upon which he instantly changed his voice and countenance and exclaiming against them as notorious liars bid the people take care how they transacted any thing with men on whose veracity they could have so little dependence The people dismissed the ambassadors in a rage and Nicias knowing nothing of the deceit was confounded and in disgrace To redeem his credit he proposed being sent once more to Sparta but not being able to obtain such terms as the Athenians demanded they immediately upon his return struck up a league with the Argives for an hundred years including the Eleans and Mantenaeans which yet did not in terms cancel that with the Lacedaemonians though it is plain that the whole scope of it was levelled against them Upon this new alliance Alcibiades was declared general and though even his best friends could not commend the method by which he had accomplished his designs yet it was looked upon as a great stroke in politics thus to divide and shake almost all Peloponnesus and to remove the war so far from the Athenian frontier that even success would profit the enemy but little should they be conquerors whereas if they were defeated Sparta itself would hardly be safe  The Spartans however were determined to crush the evil in the bud and accordingly drawing  ut their whole force both of citizens and slaves and being joined by their allies they encamped almost under the walls of Argos The Argives were not slow in meeting them they immediately marched out and offered them battle But just as  the two armies were going to engage a truce was concluded for four months as a previous step towards an amicable settlement of all differences  The Athenians thinking they had now found the Spartans sufficient employment by the troubles they had excited in Peloponnesus began to extend their views to more distant objects and they actually formed a design of adding the island of Sicily to their empire The people of Egesta supplied them with a plausible pretext for executing this project They applied to the Athenians in quality of their allies craving their aid against the inhabitants of Selinuta who were assisted by the Syracusans This opportunity was greedily laid hold of but not to engage in a war without being sure of the means of carrying it on with spirit the Athenians sent deputies to Egesta to inquire into the state of affairs and see whether there was money enough in the treasury to defray the expence of so great an undertaking The people of that city had lately borrowed from the neighbouring states a great number of gold and silver vases of an immense value and of these they now made a splendid display to the Athenian deputies Upon the return therefore of these last a resolution was immediately taken to comply with the request of the Egestans and Alcibiades Nicias and Lamachus were appointed to command the fleet with full power not only to succour Egesta and restore the inhabitants of Leontium to their city of which they had been deprived by the Syracusans but also to regulate the affairs of Sicily in such a manner as might best suit the interests of the republic  Nicias was extremely uneasy at his being ap+pointed to this command partly because he disapproved of the war itself but chiefly because he was joined in commission with Alcibiades Bu  the Athenians thought it necessary to temper th  ardour and impetuosity of the one with the coolness and deliberation of the other Nicias therefore not daring to oppose the war openly endeavoured to do it indirectly by representing the great number of difficulties with which it would be attended He said that a fleet would not be sufficient that a land army must likewise be raised and subsisted at an immense expence for as to the pompous promises made them by the Egestans these might probably fail them at a time when they stood most in need of pecuniary aid that they ought to weigh well the great disparity between them and the enemy with regard to the conveniencies they would respectively enjoy that the Syracusans would be in their own country in the midst of powerful allies disposed by inclination as well as engaged by interest to assist them with men money horses and provisions whereas the Athenians would carry on the war in a remote country possessed by their enemies where in winter news could not be brought them from home in less than four months a country where all things would oppose the Athenians and nothing be procured but by force of arms that even if the expedition succeeded it would not be productive of the mighty advantages expected from it and if it failed it would reflect eternal disgrace upon the Athenian name and that for his own part he was determined not to go unless he was supplied with every thing necessary for carrying on the war as he would not depend upon the caprice or precarious promises of allies This speech however instead of cooling the ardour of the Athenians as Nicias expected served only to inflame it more and orders were immediately given for raising as many troops and fitting out as many gallies as the generals thought necessary and the levies accordingly were carried on in Athens and other places with incredible spirit  Before we enter upon the narration of the important events that took place in the expedition to Sicily it will be proper to say a few words respecting Syracuse the capital of that island About the year of the world Corinth had acquired considerable reputation as a maritime power As the improvement of navigation generally leads to discovery so it leads to commerce also and to colonization It had this effect on the Corinthians They had not been long acquainted with Sicily before they projected the scheme of peopling part of it with the natives of Peloponnesus Archias therefore a descendant of Hercules was sent thither with a fleet furnished with every thing necessary for such an enterprize He built and peopled Syracuse which from the peculiar advantages it derived from its rich soil and capacious harbour soon became the most flourishing city in Sicily in size indeed and beauty it yielded not to any city in Greece It was long subject to Corinth and governed by nearly the same laws But as it increased in power it aimed at independence and by degrees renounced its allegiance to Corinth To its emancipation are owing the occurrences which we are now to recite  The levies being by this time completed the generals resolved to set sail immediately after having appointed Corcyra as the place of rendezvous for most of the allies and such ships as were to carry the provisions and warlike stores All the citizens as well as foreigners in Athens flocked by daybreak to the port of Pyraeus in order to behold this magnificent sight It was indeed a spectacle well worth their curiosity for neither Athens nor any other city had ever fitted out such a grand and gallant fleet as the present True it is that those which had been sent against Epidaurus and Potidaea were as considerable with respect to the number of  soldiers and ships but then they were not equipped with so much magnificence neither was their voyage so long nor the enterprize so important The city had furnished an hundred empty gallies that is threescore light ones and forty to transport the heavyarmed soldiers Every mariner received daily a drachma or ten pence English for his pay exclusive of what the captains of ships gave the rowers of the first bench When the ships were loaded and the troops got on board the trumpet sounded and solemn prayers were offered up for the success of the expediton Gold and silver cups were filling every where with wine and the accustomed libations were poured out the people who lined the shore shouting at the same time and lifting up their hands to heaven to wish their fellowcitizens a good voyage and success And now the hymn being sung and the ceremonies ended the ships sailed one after another out of the harbour after which they strove to outsail one another till they all arrived at Aegina From thence they made to Corcyra where the army of the allies was assembled with the rest of the fleet  Upon their arrival at Sicily the generals were divided in their opinions with regard to the place where they should make a descent Lamachus was for sailing directly to Syracuse and attacking the town before the inhabitants had time to recover from their first consternation But his proposal was rejected and it was thought more expedient to reduce the smaller cities first Detaching therefore ten gallies to take a view of the harbour and situation of Syracuse they landed with the rest of their forces and surprized Catana  In the mean time the enemies of Alcibiades took advantage of his absence to traduce his character which indeed was sufficiently open to attack They accused him of having neglected the  proper method of invading Sicily and they further charged him with impiety in profaning the mysteries of Ceres This was sufficient to induce the giddy multitude to recal their general but for fear of exciting a tumult in the army they only sent him orders to return to Athens that so he might pacify the people by his presence Alcibiades pretended to obey the order with great submission but reflecting on the inconstancy and caprice of his judges he no sooner reached Thurium than he disappeared and the galley therefore returned without him For this act of contumacy he was condemned to death his whole estate was confiscated and all the orders of religion were commanded to curse him Some time after upon news being brought him that the Athenians had condemned him to death  "I hope one day said he to make them sensible that I am still alive"  The Syracusans had by this time put themselves in a posture of defence and finding that Nicias did not advance towards them they talked of attacking him in his camp and some of them asked in a scoffing way whether he was come into Sicily to settle at Catana He was rouzed by this insult and determined to shew them that he was deficient neither in courage nor conduct He was afraid however of attacking the place by land for want of cavalry and it was almost equally hazardous to make a descent by sea nevertheless he chose the latter method and succeeded in it by a stratagem He had gained a citizen of Catana to go as a deserter to the Syracusans and to inform them that the Athenians lay every night in the town without their arms and that early in the morning on a certain day appointed they might surprize them seize on their camp with all their arms and baggage burn their fleet in the harbour and destroy their whole army The Syracusans gave credit to  this intelligence and marched with all their forces towards Catana which Nicias was no sooner informed of than he embarked his troops and steering away for Syracuse landed them there the next morning and fortified himself in the outskirts of the town The Syracusans were so provoked at this trick being put upon them that they immediately returned to Syracuse and presented themselves without the walls in order of battle Nicias marched out of his trenches to meet them and a very sharp action ensued in which the Athenians at length got the better and forced the enemy back to the city after having killed two hundred and sixty of them and their allies with the loss of fifty of their own men They were not however yet in a condition to attack the city and they therefore took up their winter quarters at Naxus and Catana  Next spring having received a supply of horse from Athens together with provisions and other warlike stores Nicias resolved to block up the place both by sea and land The first thing he did for this purpose was to take possession of Epipolae a high hill which commanded the city and could only be ascended by one very steep and craggy passage The Syracusans were so sensible of the importance of this post that they did every thing in their power to prevent his seizing it but Nicias landed his troops so secretly and so suddenly that he made himself master of it before they were aware He even repulsed a body of seven hundred men who were coming to dislodge him having killed three hundred of them together with their leader Here he built a fort and began to invest the town in such a manner as to cut off all communication between it and the country In the course of this work several skirmishes happened in one of which Lamachus was slain so that the sole command  now devolved upon Nicias The Syracusans made another attempt to regain this post Nicias was then sick in the fort and in bed with only his servants about him But when he found the enemy were forcing his intrenchments he got up and set fire to the engines and other wood that lay scattered about the sort which had so good an effect that it served as a signal to his own troops to come up to his relief and so terrified and confounded those of the enemy that they retreated into the city  From this time Nicias began to conceive great hopes of taking the place the rather as several of the other cities of Sicily came over to his interest and supplied his troops with all kinds of provisions The Syracusans on their side seeing themselves blocked up both by sea and land and despairing of being able to hold out much longer were already beginning to think of a surrender Nay they had actually summoned a council to settle the terms of a capitulation when to their great joy and surprize because contrary to their expectation they saw Gylippus the Lacedaemonian general arrive with a force that soon relieved them from all their fears and in a little time reduced the Athenians to a more deplorable situation than that in which they themselves were now placed Gylippus conscious of his own strength and perhaps a little actuated by Spartan pride sent a herald to the Athenians to acquaint them that he would allow them five days to leave Sicily Nicias did not deign to give any answer to this proposal and both sides therefore prepared themselves for battle  In the first engagement the Spartans were defeated chiefly on account of the narrowness of ground where they fought which was between the two walls which the Athenians had raised to invest the city and as this prevented Gylippus from extending  his lines or making use of his horse the Athenians got the better Gylippus however had the magnanimity or rather indeed good policy to take the whole blame of the miscarriage upon himself He declared that he and not his men were in fault and that he would soon give them an opportunity of recovering his honour and their own and accordingly the very next day attacking the enemy in a more advantageous spot he obtained over them a more complete victory than they had done over him so much does the event of a battle depend upon the nature of the ground where it is fought  Nicias being by this means obliged to act upon the defensive took possession of Plemmyrium near the great harbour where he built three forts and almost shut himself up in garrison Besides the Lacedaemonians were now considerably strengthened by a reinforcement they received from Corinth In this state of affairs Nicias wrote home a most melancholy account of his present situation He told his countrymen that instead of besieging the Syracusans he himself was now besieged by them and their allies that the towns revolted from him the slaves and mercenaries deserted and his troops were employed in guarding the forts and bringing in provisions in which last service many of them were cut off by the enemy's horse He added that unless a reinforcement was sent him equal to that with which he had originally set out it was in vain to think of attempting any thing farther and in any event he begged that he himself might be recalled as his health was so much impaired as to render him incapable of going on with the service This last part of his request however the Athenians would by no means consent to but they resolved to send out Eurymedon and Demosthenes with fresh supplies the former  immediately with ten gallies and the other early in the spring with a stronger force At the same time they appointed Menander and Euthydemus as assistants to Nicias and these immediately joined him  But Gylippus was determined to be beforehand with the Athenians and to crush if possible the force they now had in Sicily before the succours should arrive For this purpose he persuaded the Syracusans to hazard a battle by sea while he should endeavour to storm the forts of Plemmyrium The former part of the scheme failed the latter succeeded The Athenians had only sixty ships to oppose to eighty of the Syracusans but as they were greatly superior to them in naval skill they at last got the better though victory seemed at first to incline to the side of the enemy The Athenians lost three ships in this engagement but the Syracusans had nine sunk and three taken In the mean time Gylippus attacking the forts at Plemmyrium while many of those who defended them were gone to the shore in order to view the seafight he carried the greatest of them by storm and this so intimidated the garrisons of the other two that they abandoned them in a moment  Encouraged by this success he resolved to repeat his blow before the arrival of the Athenian succours He therefore persuaded the Syracusans to venture another battle by sea They did so and with a greater degree of good fortune than had attended them on the former occasion Nicias would willingly have declined this engagement but he was overruled or rather overpersuaded by his two colleagues Menander and Euthydemus The Athenians had seventyfive gallies the Syracusans eighty The first day the two fleets continued in sight of each other without coming to a general engagement and only a few skirmishes passed between them The Syracusans did not make the  least motion the second day But on the third they came up much sooner than usual when a great part of the day was spent in skirmishing after which they retired The Athenians not imagining they would return again that day did not keep themselves in readiness to receive them But the Syracusans having refreshed themselves in great haste and gone on board their gallies attacked the Athenians unawares and in a little time threw them into irretrievable confusion These last indeed would have received a much more severe blow had they not taken shelter behind their transports which had been previously drawn up in a line to protect them They lost however on this occasion seven gallies and a great number of their soldiers were either killed or taken prisoners  While Nicias was reflecting with grief upon his present unhappy situation and looking forward with terror to the still more melancholy prospect that lay before him he was relieved from all his uneasiness by the arrival of Demosthenes's fleet which now came forward in great pomp and splendour It consisted of seventythree gallies on board of which were five thousand fighting men and above three thousand archers slingers and bowmen This was a force which if properly managed might have turned the scale of victory yet once more in favour of the Athenians but by the precipitancy of Demosthenes and the other generals in oppositition to the more cautious measures recommended by Nicias it only served to heighten their disgrace and the enemy's triumph  It was resolved in a council of war to attack the town immediately and as a previous step to it to make themselves masters of Epipolae In their first assault upon this latter place which was made by night they stormed the outer entrenchment but as they were advancing towards the second  they were suddenly attacked by the forces of the city which had marched under arms out of their lines and were supported by Gylippus These however being seized with astonishment which the darkness increased were soon put to flight but a body of Boeotians who followed them made a more vigorous stand and marching against the Athenians with their pikes presented repulsed them with great shouts and committed a most dreadful slaughter This spread an universal terror through the rest of the army Those who fled either forced along such as were advancing to their assistance or else mistaking them for enemies turned their arms against them They were now all mixed indiscriminately it being impossible amidst the horrors of so dark a night to distinguish friend from foe and death was frequently inflicted by that hand from which in the daytime protection would have been received The Athenians sought for one another to no purpose and from their often asking the word by which only they were able to know one another a strange confusion of sounds was heard which occasioned no little disorder not to mention that they by this means divulged their watchword to the enemy and could not learn theirs because by their being together and in a body they had no occasion to repeat it In the mean time those who were pursued threw themselves from the top of the rocks and many were dashed to pieces by the fall and as most of those who escaped straggled from one another up and down the fields and woods they were cut to pieces the next day by the enemy's horse who pursued them Two thousand Athenians were slain in this engagement and a great quantity of arms was taken those who fled having thrown them away that they might be the better able to escape over the precipices  Thus were at once blasted all the flattering hopes which the Athenians had conceived on the arrival of Demosthenes and Gylippus having soon after made the tour of Sicily and brought in with him a great number of fresh troops acquired by that means such an indisputed superiority over the Athenians that these last convinced of their utter inability to make any further head against him resolved immediately to abandon the island and return to their own country But just as they were upon the point of embarking wholly unsuspected by the enemy who never supposed they would quit the island so soon the moon was suddenly eclipsed and as this was a phaenomenon with the real cause of which they were utterly unacquainted they concluded it to be a prodigy or portent and therefore dreaded the consequences of it It had been customary upon former occasions to suspend the execution of any enterprize for three days after such an accident happened But the soothsayers being now consulted said that the Athenians must not sail till nine times three days were past these are Thucydides's words which doubtless was a mysterious number in the opinion of the people Nicias scrupulous to a fault and full of a mistaken veneration for those blind interpreters of the will of the gods declared that he would wait a whole revolution of the moon and not set sail till the same day of the next month as if he had not seen the planet shine with her usual brightness the moment she emerged from the shadow of the earth by which she had been darkened  The Syracusans however being informed of the intended departure of the Athenians were determined not to let them retire in peace and if possible not even retire at all but either to cut them off entirely or oblige them to surrender as prisoners of war For this purpose they attacked  the entrenchments immediately and gained a slight advantage over them The next day they made a second attack and at the same time sailed with seventysix gallies against eightysix of the Athenians After an obstinate dispute the Athenians were defeated with the loss of eighteen of their ships which were taken by the enemy and their crews cut to pieces Eurymedon too their commander lost his life in the engagement  In order to prevent their escaping by sea the enemy shut up the mouth of the great harbour which was about five hundred paces wide with gallies placed crosswise and other vessels fixed with anchors and iron chains and at the same time made the requisite preparations for a battle in case they should have courage to engage again The Athenians seeing themselves cooped up in this manner and having no other means of procuring provisions but by being masters of the sea were obliged to hazard another engagement upon that element Both commanders exerted all their eloquence to animate their men and none could be actuated by stronger motives than now influenced them for upon the issue of the battle which was going to be fought depended not only their own lives and liberties but even the fate of their native country This battle was more obstinate and bloody than any of the preceding ones The Athenians being arrived at the mouth of the port easily took the first ships they came to but when they attempted to break the chain of the rest the enemy poured in upon them from all quarters As near two hundred gallies came rushing on each side into a narrow place there must necessarily be very great confusion and the vessels could not easily advance or retire or turn about to renew the attack The beaks of the gallies for this reason did little execution but there were very furious and frequent discharges  The Athenians were overwhelmed with a shower of stones which always did execution from whatever place they were thrown whereas they defended themselves only by shooting darts and arrows which by the motion of the ships were diverted from their aim and seldom hit the mark at which they were levelled Ariston the Corinthian had given the Syracusans this counsel These discharges being over the heavyarmed soldiers attempted to board the enemy's ships in order to fight hand to hand and it frequently happened that while they were climbing up one side of these their own ships were entered on the other so that two or three ships were sometime grappled together which occasioned great confusion Add to this that the noise of the ships which dashed against one another and the different cries of the victors and vanquished prevented the orders of the officers from being distinctly heard The Athenians wanted to force a passage whatever might be the consequence in order to secure their return to their own country and this the enemy endeavoured to prevent that they might thereby gain a more complete victory The two land armies which were drawn up on the highest part of the shore were spectators of the action while the inhabitants of the city ran to the walls in order to behold it All these saw clearly because of their little distance from the fleets every thing that passed and contemplated the battle as from an amphitheatre but not without great anxiety and terror Attentive to and shuddering at every movement and the several changes of fortune that happened they discovered the concern they had in the battle their fears their hopes their grief their joy by different cries and different gestures stretching out their hands sometimes towards the combatants to animate them at other times towards heaven to implore the succour  and protection of the gods At last the Athenian fleet after making a long and vigorous resistance was put to flight and driven against the shore The Syracusans on the walls seeing their countrymen victorious conveyed the news to the whole city by an universal shout The victors immediately sailed towards Syracuse where they erected a trophy while the Athenians were so much dejected that they did not even request the dead bodies of their fellow soldiers to be delivered to them in order to honour them with the rites of burial  There now remained but two methods for them to chuse either to attempt the passage a second time for which they had still ships and soldiers sufficient or to abandon their fleet to the enemy and retire by land Demosthenes recommended the former plan but the soldiers were so much intimidated by their late defeat that they had not courage to undertake it The second method was therefore adopted and they accordingly prepared to set out in the night the better to conceal their march from the enemy Hermocrates however the Syracusan general was extremely unwilling that so large a body of men amounting to near forty thousand should be suffered to depart lest they should fortify themselves in some corner of the island and renew the war At the same time he knew it would be impossible to persuade the Syracusans to oppose their march that evening as they were then engaged in celebrating their late victory and solemnizing the festival of Hercules He therefore fell upon another expedient He sent out a few horsemen who were to pass for friends of the Athenians and ordered them to tell Nicias not to retire till daylight as the Syracusans lay in ambush for him and had seized on all the passes  Nicias was so weak as to believe this intelligence and accordingly delayed his departure not  only that evening but the whole next day in order that the soldiers might have more time to prepare for their march and carry off whatever might be necessary for their subsistence But this delay afterwards proved fatal to them For early next morning the enemy took possession of all the difficult avenues fortified the banks of the rivers in those parts where they were fordable broke down the bridges and spread detachments of horse up and down the plain so that there was not one place which the Athenians could pass without fighting  They set out upon their march the third day after the battle with a design to retire to Catana Their army was divided into two bodies both drawn up in the form of a phalanx the first being commanded by Nicias and the second by Demosthenes with the baggage in the centre In this manner they proceeded for several days during which they were terribly harrassed by the enemy who hung upon their rear and overwhelmed them with showers of darts and arrows but never would stand a general engagement when the Athenians wheeled about  Finding therefore their numbers daily decrease and being at the same time in extreme want of provisions they altered their plan and instead of continuing their march to Catana they directed their route towards Camerina and Gela As this scheme was executed in the night it was attended with so much confusion that the rearguard under Demosthenes soon parted from the main body and lost their way Next day the Syracusans came up with them and surrounded them in a narrow place and though they defended themselves for some time with incredible bravery yet finding it impossible to effect their escape they were at last obliged to surrender  risoners of war which they did upon condition  hat they should not be put to death nor condemned  to perpetual imprisonment About six thousand men surrendered upon these terms  In the mean time Nicias procceeded on his march and crossing the river Erineus encamped on a mountain where the enemy overtook him the next day and summoned him to surrender as Demosthenes had done Nicias at first could not believe what they told him concerning Demosthenes and therefore begged leave to send some horse to inquire into the truth and when he found that matters really were so he offered to defray all the expences of the war provided they would suffer him to quit the island with his forces But this proposal was rejected by the enemy who immediately renewed the attack and though Nicias defended himself during the whole night and even continued his march next day to the river Asinarus yet he was quickly pursued thither by the Syracusans who threw most of the Athenians into the stream the rest having already thrown themselves into it in order to quench their burning thirst Here the most terrible havock was committed so that Nicias finding all things desperate was obliged to surrender upon this single condition that Gylippus should discontinue the fight and spare the lives of his men The lives of the men indeed were spared but Nicias and Demosthenes after being scourged with rods were cruelly put to death a striking proof of the barbarity of the age By this savage act the Syracusans tarnished the glory they had acquired by the gallant defence of their city and the signal victory they had won  It must be owned indeed that Gylippus and even many of the Syracusans themselves did all they could to save the lives of the Athenian generals but the great body of the people egged on by their orators and particularly by Diocles one of their most popular leaders could be satisfied  with nothing less than the blood of these two illustrious men The fate of Nicias is the more to be lamented as no man was ever more remarkable for humanity and goodnature and though he headed this expedition in obedience to the commands of his countrymen yet he did every thing in his power to prevent them from undertaking it Demosthenes too was a man of so respectable a character that the famous orator of the same name many years after valued himself on account of his being of the same family  As to the prisoners they were shut up in the dungeons of Syracuse where many of them perished through want and bad treatment and those that survived being afterwards sold for slaves recommended themselves so strongly to their masters by their modest prudent and ingenuous behaviour that many of them soon obtained their liberty and some of them even owed that favour to their being able to repeat the finest scenes of Euripides's tragedies of which the Sicilians were passionately fond so that when they returned to their own country they went and saluted the poet as their deliverer and informed him of the great advantage they had derived from their being acquainted with his verses  The Athenians were so little prepared to receive the news of this defeat or rather indeed they were so confident of receiving news of a contrary nature that they condemned to death the man that first brought the intelligence but when they found that matters were really worse than fame had reported they were at once overwhelmed with grief and despair They had never indeed been reduced to so deplorable a condition as they were now having neither horse foot money ships nor mariners in a word they sunk into the deepest despondency and expected every moment that the  enemy elate with so great a victory and strengthened by the junction of the allies would come and invade Athens both by sea and land with all the forces of Peloponnesus Cicero therefore had reason to say when speaking of the battles in the harbour of Syracuse that it was there the troops of Athens as well as their gallies were ruined and sunk and that in this harbour the power and glory of the Athenians were miserably shipwrecked  The Athenians however did not suffer themselves to be wholly dejected but assumed courage from despair They raised money on every side for building new ships they retrenched all superfluous expences and they established a council of old men to examine every matter before it was brought into the assembly of the people In a word they took every step that could possibly tend to retrieve their ruined affairs or at least prevent them from growing worse than they were But nothing could restore them to their former splendid condition for from this time forward the Athenians present us with a very different picture from what they have hitherto done We are no longer to behold them making a figure in arts and arms giving lessons in politeness humanity philosophy and war to all the nations around and aiming at the erection of an empire which if once thoroughly established would have bid defiance to all the neighbouring states Instead of aspiring to the conquest of their neighbours they are now content with defending their own territories at home instead of directing the councils and conducing the confederate armies of Greece they now confine all their attention to their own private affairs they in a manner become annihilated they fade from the eye of the historian and other nations whose names have hitherto been scarcely mentioned emerge from obscurity  It was in this deplorable state of the Athenian affairs that Alcibiades made proposals of returning home provided the administration of the republic were put into the hands of the great and powerful and not left to the populace who had expelled him In order to induce his countrymen to agree to these terms he offered to procure them not only the favour of Tissaphernes the king of Persia's lieutenant with whom he had taken refuge but even that of the king himself upon condition they would abolish the democracy or popular government because the king he said would place more confidence in the engagements of the nobility than in those of the giddy and capricious multitude The chief man who opposed his return was Phrynicus one of the generals who in order to accomplish his purpose sent word to Astyochus the Lacedaemonian general that Alcibiades was using his utmost endeavours to engage Tissaphernes in the Athenian interest He offered further to betray to him the whole army and navy of the Athenians But his treasonable practices being all detected by the good understanding between Alcibiades and Astyochus he was stript of his office and afterwards stabbed in the marketplace  In the mean time the Athenians proceeded to complete that change of government which had been proposed to them by Alcibiades the democracy began to be abolished in several of the smaller cities and soon after the scheme was carried boldly into execution in Athens itself by Pysander who had the chief hand in this transaction To give a new form to the government he caused ten commissaries with absolute power to be appointed who were however at a certain fixed time to give the people an account of what they had done At the expiration of that term the general assembly was summoned in which the first resolution was that every one  should be admitted to make such proposals as he thought fit without being liable to any accusation or consequent penalty for infringing the law It was afterwards decreed that a new council should be formed with full power to administer the public affairs and to elect new magistrates For this purpose five presidents were established who nominated one hundred persons including themselves Each of these chose and associated three more at his own pleasure which made in all four hundred in whom an absolute power was lodged But to amuse the people and gratify them with the shadow of a popular government whilst they instituted a real oligarchy it was said that the four hundred would call a council of five thousand citizens to assist them whenever they should find it necessary The assemblies of the people indeed were still held as usual but nothing was done in them but by order of the four hundred In this manner were the Athenians deprived of their liberty after having enjoyed it almost a hundred years from the time of destroying the tyranny of the Pisistratidae  This decree having passed without opposition after the breaking up of the assembly the four hundred armed with daggers and attended by an hundred and twenty young men whom they made use of when any emergency required it entered the senate and compelled the senators to retire after having paid them the arrears of their salaries that were still due They elected new magistrates out of their own body observing the usual ceremonies upon such occasions They did not think proper to recall those who had been banished lest they should authorize the return of Alcibiades whose uncontroulable spirit they dreaded and who would soon have made himself master of the government Abusing their power in a tyrannical manner they put some to death others they banished and confiscated  their estates with impunity All who ventured to oppose this change or even to complain of it were butchered upon false pretexts and those were intimidated who demanded justice of the murderers The four hundred soon after their establishment sent ten deputies to Samos for the army's approbation of their conduct  The army in the mean time which was at Samos protested against these proceedings in the city and by the persuasion of Thrasybulus recalled Alcibiades and created him general with full power to fa  l directly to the Pyraeus and crush this new tyranny Alcibiades however would not give way to this rash opinion but went first to shew himself to Tissaphernes and let him know that it was now in his power to treat with him either as a friend or an enemy By which means he awed the Athenians with Tissaphernes and Tissaphernes with the Athenians When afterwards the four hundred sent to Samos to vindicate their proceedings the army was for putting the messengers to death and persisted in the design upon the Pyraeus but Alcibiades by opposing it manifestly saved the commonwealth  Mean while the innovation in Athens had occasioned such factions and tumults that the four hundred were more intent upon providing for their own safety than carrying on the war and the better to accomplish this purpose they fortified that part of the Pyraeus which commands the mouth of the haven and resolved in case of extremity rather to let in the Lacedaemonians than expose their persons to the fury of their fellowcitizens The Spartans took occasion from these disturbances to hover about with fortytwo gallies under the conduct of Hegesandrides and the Athenians with thirtysix under Timochares were forced to engage them but lost part of their fleet and the rest were dispersed  To add to which all Euboea except Oreus revolted to the Peloponnesians  This failure of success gave the finishing blow to the power of the four hundred The Athenians without delay deposed them as the authors of all the calamities under which they groaned Alcibiades was recalled by unanimous consent and earnestly solicited to make all possible haste to the assistance of the city But judging that if he returned immediately to Athens he should owe his recall to the compassion and favour of the people he resolved to render his return glorious and triumphant and to deserve it by some considerable exploit  For this purpose leaving Samos with a small number of ships he cruized about the islands of Cos and Onidos and having learnt that Mindarus the Spartan admiral had sailed to the Hellespont with his whole fleet and that the Athenians were in pursuit of him he steered that way with the utmost expedition to support them and arrived happily with his eighteen vessels at the time the fleets were engaged near Abydos in a battle which lasted till night without any advantage on either side His arrival gave new courage to the Spartans at first  o believed he was still their friend but Alcibiades  out the Athenian flag in the admiral's gal  curately  e  upon them and put them to  and pursuing his blow sunk many of their vessels and made a great slaughter of their soldiers who had leaped into the sea to save themselves by swimming The Athenians after having captured  of their gallies and retaken those they had  erected a trophy  Alcibiades after this victory went to visit Tissaphernes who was so far from receiving him as he expected that he immediately caused him to be seized and sent away to Sardis telling him that he had orders from the king to make war upon the  Athenians but the truth is he was afraid of being accused to his master by the Peloponnesians and thought by this act of injustice to purge himself from all former imputations Alcibiades after thirty days made his escape to Clazomenae and soon after bore down upon the Peloponnesian fleet which rode at anchor before the port of Cyzicus With twenty of his best ships he broke through the enemy pursued those who abandoned their vessels and fled to land and made a great slaughter The Athenians took the enemy's whole fleet and made themselves masters of Cyzicus while Mingimis the Lacedaemonian general was found among the number of the slain  Alcibiades well knew how to make use of the advantage he had gained and at the head of his victorious troops took several cities which had revolted from the Athenians Calcedon Salymbria and Byzantium were among the number Thus flushed with success he seemed to desire nothing more than to be once more seen by his countrymen as his presence would be a triumph to his friends and an insult to his enemies He accordingly set sail for Athens Besides the ships covered with bucklers and spoils of all sorts in the manner of trophies a great number of vessels were also towed after him by way of triumph he displayed likewise the ensigns and ornaments of those he had burnt which were more than the others the whole amounting to about two hundred ships  It is said that reflecting on what had been done against him upon approaching the port he was strack with some apprehensions and was afraid to quit his vessel till he saw from the deck a great number of his friends and relations who were come to the shore to receive him and earnestly entreated him to land As soon as he was landed the multitude who came out to meet him fixed their eyes  upon him thronged about him saluted him with loud acclamations and crowned him with garlands He received their congratulations with great satisfaction he desired to be discharged from his former condemnation and obtained from the priests an absolution from all their former denunciations  Yet notwithstanding these triumphs the real power of Athens was now no more the strength of the state was gone and even the passion for liberty was lost in the common degeneracy of the times Many of the meaner sort of people earnestly desired Alcibiades to take upon him the sovereign power and to set himself above the reach of envy by securing all authority in his own person But the great were neither so warm nor so injudicious in their expressions of gratitude They contented themselves with appointing him generalissimo of all their forces they granted him whatever he demanded and gave him for colleagues the generals most agreeable to him He set sail accordingly with an hundred ships and steered for the island of Andros that had revolted where having defeated the inhabitants he went from thence to Samos intending to make that the seat of war In the mean time the Lacedaemonians alarmed at his success made choice of a general every way qualified to make head against him This was Lysander who though born of the highest family had been enured to hardships from his earliest youth and was strongly attached to the manners and discipline of his country He was brave ambitious circumspect but at the same time cunning crafty and deceitful and these latter qualities ran so much through his whole life that it was usually said of him that he cheated children with foul play and men with oaths and it is reported to have been a maxim of his that when the lion's strength fails we must make use of the subtilty of the fox  Lysander having brought his army to Ephesus gave orders for assembling ships of burden from all parts and erected a dock for the building of gallies he made the ports free for merchants and by encouraging trade of every kind he laid the foundation of that splendour and magnificence to which Ephesus afterwards attained Meanwhile receiving advice that Cyrus the king of Persia's son was arrived at Sardis he went thither to pay him a visit and at the same time to complain to him of the conduct of Tissaphernes whose duplicity he said had proved fatal to their common cause Cyrus was sufficiently disposed to listen to any complaints against Tissaphernes to whom he himself had a personal enmity and he therefore came readily into the views of Lysander and at his request increased the pay of the seamen This last circumstance had a surprising effect It instantly almost unmanned the gallies of the Athenians and supplied the Lacedaemonian fleet with plenty of sailors who without enquiring into the justice of the cause on either side went over to that party which gave the best pay  Nor was this the only misfortune which the Athenians now met with For Alcibiades being obliged to leave the fleet in order to raise the supplies gave the command of it to Antiochus with strict orders not to attack or engage the enemy in his absence But Antiochus desirous of distinguishing himself by some great action before the return of Alcibiades sailed away directly for Ephesus and used every art to provoke the enemy to an engagement Lysander at first contented himself with sending out a few ships to repel his insults but the Athenian gallies advancing to support their commander other Lacedaemonian vessels likewise came on till at last both fleets arrived and the engagement became general After a sharp struggle Lysander  obtained the victory having killed Antiochus and taken fifteen of the Athenian gallies It was in vain that Alcibiades soon after came up to the relief of his friends it was in vain that he offered to renew the combat Lysander was too wise to hazard the advantage he had gained by venturing on a second engagement  This misfortune proved fatal to the reputation of Alcibiades though indeed it was his own glory that ruined him for the people from his uninterrupted success had conceived such a high opinion of his abilites that they thought it impossible for him to fail in any thing he seriously undertook and they therefore now began to question his integrity and deprived him of the command of the army  About the same time Callicratidas was appointed to succeed Lysander whose year was expired This man was equal to his predecessor in courage and greatly superior in probity and justice being as open and ingenuous as the other was cunning and crafty His first attempt was against Methymna in Lesbos which he took by storm He then threatened Conon who had succeeded Alcibiades that he would make him leave off  debauching  the sea and accordingly soon after pursued him into the port of Mitylene with an hundred and seventy sail took thirty of his ships and besieged him in the town from which he cut off all provisions He soon after took ten ships more out of twelve that were coming to the relief of Conon Then hearing that the Athenians had fitted out their whole strength consisting of an hundred and fifty sail he left fifty of his ships under Etonicus to carry on the siege of Mitylene and with an hundred and twenty more met the Athenians at Arginusae overagainst Lesbos His pilot advising him to retreat because the enemy were superior in number  "Sparta" replied he  "will be never the worse inhabited though I should be slain"  The fight accordingly was immediately begun and was maintained for a long time with equal bravery on both sides till at last the ship of Callicratidas charging through the midst of the enemy was sunk and the rest fled The Peloponnesians lost about seventy sail and the Athenians twentyfive with most of the men in them  The Athenian admirials instead of being rewarded for the victory they had gained were severely punished for a supposed neglect of duty They were accused of not having done their utmost to save their men who had been shipwrecked and they were accordingly sent home in irons to answer for their conduct They alledged in their defence that they were pursuing the enemy and at the same time gave orders about taking up the men to those whose business it more peculiarly was particularly to Theramenes who now appeared against them but yet that their orders could not be executed on account of a violent storm which happened at that time This plea seemed so satisfactory that several stood up and offered to bail them but in another assembly the popular incendiaries demanded justice and so awed the judges that Socrates was the only man who had courage enough to declare that he would do nothing contrary to law and accordingly refused to act After a long debate eight of the ten were condemned and six of them were put to death among whom was Pericles son of the great statesman of the same name He maintained that they had failed in nothing of their duty as they had given orders for we dead bodies being taken up that if any one were guilty it was Theramenes himself who being charged with these orders had neglected to put them in execution but that he accused nobody  and that the tempest which came on unexpectedly at the very instant was a sufficient apology and entirely freed the accused from all kind of guilt He demanded that a whole day should be allowed them to make their defence a favour not denied to the most criminal and that they should be tried separately He represented that they were not in the least obliged to precipitate a sentence in which the lives of the most illustrious citizens were concerned that it was in some measure attacking the gods to make them responsible for the winds and weather that they could not without the most flagrant ingratitude and injustice inflict death upon the conquerors to whom they ought rather to decree crowns and honours or give up the defenders of their country to the rage of those who envied them that if they did so their unjust judgment will be followed by a sudden but vain repentance which would leave behind it the sharpest remorse and cover them with eternal infamy  Among the number also was Diomedon a person equally eminent for his valour and his probity as he was carrying to execution he demanded to be heard  "Athenians" said he"I wish the sentence you have passed upon us may not prove the misfortune of the republic but I have one fav  ur to ask of you in behalf of my colleagues and myself which is to acquit us before the gods of the vows we made to them for you and ourselves as we are not in a condition to discharge them for it is to their aid invoked before the battle we acknowledge that we are indebted for the victory gained by us over the enemy"  There was not a good citizen that did not melt into tears at this discourse so full of piety and religion and behold with surprize the moderation of a person who seeing himself unjustly condemned did not however express the least resentment nor even utter a complaint  against his judges but was solely intent in favour of an ungrateful country which had doomed them to perish upon what it owed to the gods in common with them for the victory they had lately obtained  This complication of injustice and ingratitude gave the finishing blow to the affairs of the Athenians they struggled for a while after the defeat at Syracuse but from this time forward they rapidly declined though seemingly in the arms of victory The enemy after their defeat had once more recourse to Lysander who had so often led them to conquest in him they placed their chief confidence and earnestly solicited his return The Lacedaemonians therefore to gratify their allies and yet to observe their laws which forbade that honour being twice conferred on the same person sent him with an inferior title but with the power of admiral Thus appointed Lysander sailed towards the Hellespont and laid siege to Lampsacus which he took by storm and abandoned it to the mercy of the soldiers The Athenians who followed him close upon the news of his success steered forward towards Olestus and from thence sailing along the coast halted over against the enemy at Aegos Potamos a place fatal to the Athenians  The Hellespont is not above two thousand paces broad in that place The two fleets seeing themselves so near each other expected only to rest that day and hoped to come to an engagement on the next But Lysander had another design in view He commanded the seamen and pilots to go on board their gallies and hold themselves in readiness as if they were really to fight next morning He likewise commanded the land army to be drawn up in battlearray upon the coast and to wait his orders in profound silence On the morning as soon  as the sun was risen the Athenians rowed towards them with their whole fleet and offered them battle This however Lysander did not think proper to accept even though his ships were ranged in perfect order with their heads towards the enemy The Athenians ascribing this conduct to fear or cowardice retired in the evening and thinking they were in no danger went ashore to amuse and regale themselves as if no enemy had been nigh Of this last circumstance Lysander was fully informed by some gallies he sent out to observe their motions To throw them therefore into still greater security and put them more off their guard he allowed the three following days to pass in the same manner during each of which the Athenians came regularly up and offered him battle which he as regularly persisted to decline  In the mean time Alcibiades who since his disgrace had lived in Thrace and was much better acquainted with the character of the Lacedaemonians and particularly with that of Lysander than the present Athenian generals came and warned them of their danger he even offered with a body of Thracian troops to attack the enemy by land and thus force them to a battle But the Athenian generals jealous of their honour and thinking that if the event proved successful Alcibiades would enjoy all the glory and if otherwise the whole blame would fall upon them not only refused his assistance but even rejected his salutary advice The consequence was that on the evening of the fifth day when they had retired as usual and their men were all gone on shore and dispersed up and down the country Lysander came suddenly upon them with his whole force and attacking them in this unprepared and defenceless condition he easily made a capture of their whole fleet except nine gallies including the sacred ship with which  Conon contrived to escape to Cyprus where he took refuge with Evagoras This was one of the most masterly strokes of generalship that ever was performed in ancient or perhaps even in modern times for by it Lysander in the space of an hour put end to a war that had already lasted twentyseven years and but for him would probably have lasted much longer  The number of prisoners amounted to three thousand and the fate of these is a shocking proof of the barbarous manners of the age for it cannot be denied that with all their attainments in eloquence and poetry and the other arts that depend upon the imagination the Greeks and Romans were greatly inferior to the moderns not merely in their knowledge of nature but in civility politeness and in every thing that tends to humanize the mind of man The fact is these unhappy men were instantly put to death though this was said to be only by way of retaliation for that the Athenians had caused to be thrown down a precipice all the men that were taken in two Lacedaemonian gallies and had likewise made a decree for cutting off the thumb of the right hand of all the prisoners of war in order to disable them from handling the pike and that they might be fit only to serve at the oar Philocles the chief author both of this barbarous act and this severe decree was now called upon to shew what he could urge in his defence when he haughtily replied"Accuse not people of crimes who have no judges but as you are victors use your right and do by us as we had done by you if we had conquered" The only person that was saved out of the whole number was Adamantus who had opposed the decree  The Athenians were no sooner informed of the entire defeat of their army than they were overwh  lmed with consternation They already thought  they saw Lysander at their gates nor was it long before he came there But before he did so he commanded all the Athenians that were scattered up and down in different parts of Greece to take shelter in Athens on pain of death This he did with a design so to croud the city that he might be able soon to reduce it by famine And indeed in a little time he actually so reduced it For Agis and Pausanias the two kings of Sparta having besieged it by land and Lysander himself blocking it up by sea the wretched Athenians after undergoing the most intolerable hardships were driven to such extremity that they sent deputies to Agis with offers of abandoning all their possessions their city and port only excepted The haughty Lacedaemonian referred their deputies to the state itself and when these suppliants made known their commission to the Ephori they were ordered to depart and come again with other proposals if they expected peace  At length Theramenes an Athenian undertook to manage the treaty with Lysander and after a conference which lasted three months he received full powers to treat at Lacedaemon When he attended by nine others arrived before the Ephori some of the confederates represented the necessity of destroying Athens entirely without listening to any further proposals But the Lacedaemonians told them that they would not consent to the destruction of a city which had preserved the general independence of Greece in the most critical juncture and they therefore agreed to a peace upon these conditions that the long walls and fortifications of the Piraeus should be demolished that they should deliver up all their ships but twelve that they should restore their exiles that they should make a league offensive and defensive with the Lacedaemonians and serve them in all their expeditions both by sea and land  Theramenes being returned with the articles to Athens was asked why he acted in a manner so contrary to the intentions of Themistocles and gave those walls into the hands of the Lacedaemonians which he built in defiance of them  "I have my eye" said he "upon Themistocles's design he raised these walls for the preservation of the city and I for the very same reason would have them destroyed for if walls only secure a city Sparta which has none is in a very bad condition"  Such an answer would not have satisfied the Athenians at any other time but being now reduced to the last extremity it did not admit of a long debate whether they should accept the treaty At last Lysander coming to the Piraeus demolished the walls with great solemnity and all the insulting triumphs of music and thus was a period put to the famous Peleponnesian war the longest the most expensive and the most bloody in which Greece had ever been engaged  It would be unpardonable in us not to pay that tribute of gratitude and respect which is due to the memory of those exalted geniuses whose labours adorned the nations of their own time and have polished and humanized all succeeding ages Wars and political contests serve but to depopulate the earth or to fill the minds of men with animosity and hate while the labours of the historian the fancies of the poet and the discoveries of the philosopher enlighten the understanding meliorate the heart and teach us fortitude and resignation Such peaceful and improving arts well deserve our notice More especially does the cultivation of them in Greece deserve our attention as many of the writers of that country were renowned for military and political as as well as literary accomplishments  Of Homer it were unnecessary to say much his merit being well known It is not probable that he was the first of the Grecian poets There seem to have been authors prior to him from whom he has borrowed in the execution of his Iliad but as he was the first poet of note it was not unnatural to place him at the head of all ancient bards Seven different places contended for the honour of giving him birth but Smyrna seems to have the best claim He is supposed to have been born about two hundred and forty years after the destruction of Troy  Hesiod was either contemporary with Homer or lived immediately after him Their works will not bear a comparison Homer is stately and sublime while Hesiod is plain and agreeable But when we say so we do not mean to detract in the least from the reputation of Hesiod To write with ease and propriety was all he aimed at and this he certainly attained  About the beginning of the war which preceded the peace concluded between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians for fifty years died Aeschylus the Athenian dramatic writer He has the same claim to the title of  father of tragedy  which Homer has to that of  epic poetry  For though he was not the first who attempted that sort of composition yet he was the first who reduced it to any kind of regularity or method In the days of Solon Thespis made a considerable improvement by introducing a single person whose business was to relieve the chorus by the recital of some extraordinary adventure It was Aeschylus who exchanged the cart of Thespis for a theatre who introduced a variety of performers each taking a part in the representation of some great action and dressed in a manner suited to his character The style of Aeschylus is pompous and sometimes sublime but far  from being harmonious He is frequently too so very obscure that it is no easy matter to find out his meaning The chief object of his pieces is  terror  and to do him justice it must be acknowledged that few dramatic writers have surpassed him in exciting that passion  During that period in which Greece was so much distracted by the Peloponnesian war there flourished Sophocles Euripedes Aristophanes c among the poets Herodotus and Thucydides among the historians and Socrates among the philosophers  Sophocles had applied so intensely to the study of tragedy when a young man that his first piece was judged not inferior to the very best of those of Aeschylus Both these poets were stately in their manner but Aeschylus was the more sublime That advantage however was more than counterbalanced by the versatility of Sophocles's genius and by his superior perspicuity and eloquence He was also more successful than his master in his appeal to the passions and though he did not harrow up the breast by  terror  he softened it more by  pity  and acquired of course the reputation of being a more amiable and polite writer Sophocles was likewise much more happy than his predecessor in the conduct of his plots He made them more interesting by being more artful He also contrived to make the performances of the chorus bear a relation to the main action and so rendered the whole entire He wrote a hundred and twenty tragedies of which seven only remain He lived to the age of and then is said to have died of joy for the success of his last piece as Aeschylus is reported to have done of grief for being foiled by him in his first  Euripides the rival of Sophocles aimed not at the lofty strains of Aeschylus or of his great competitor  He is more sententious and moral than either of them and seemed to have as strong a desire to instruct mankind as to obtain their applause Correctness and elegance were the qualities of style which he appears to have admired He is less artful and magnificent than Sophocles but then he is more natural and more useful We have already mentioned a circumstance much to his honour the emancipation of many of the Athenians who were made prisoners at Syracuse because they were able to repeat some of his beautiful verses  While tragedy was improving in the hands of Sophocles and Euripedes comedy was advancing under the guidance of Eupolis Cratinus and Aristophanes But the most distinguished of this kind was Aristophanes At the same time that he entertained the Athenians with his pleasantry he lashed them with his satire True it is he did not possess much of that fine raillery which has given so smooth and yet so sharp an edge to modern comedy but then he had fire and strength and as he introduced his characters by their real names occupations c his performances were often more relished and very probably more useful than those of the tragedians  As to history Herodotus is considered as the father of that species of composition in Greece He wrote the history of the wars between the Greeks and Persians and gave a detail of the affairs of almost all other nations from the reign of Cyrus to that of Xerxes His work consists of nine books It is clothed in the Ionic dialect and is a perfect model of simplicity and elegance  Thucydides is esteemed a more able writer than even Herodotus He wants indeed that native elegance for which his predecessor is admired but then he is more judicious and energetic He wrote the history of the Peloponnesian war  Of Socrates Plato Aristotle Demosthenes and other illustrious Grecian writers and philosophers mention is made in the different parts of this work There is a circumstance that merits our attention here the discovery of the  Metonic  or  golden number  by Meton That philosopher flourished a little before the commencement of the Peloponnesian war and was much esteemed by the Athenians Pindar was a native of Thebes and contemporary with Meton  CHAP X FROM THE DEMOLITION OF THE ATHENIAN POWER TO THE DEATH OF SOCRATES  THOUGH the Lacedaemonians would not consent to the entire destruction of Athens as they would not be guilty they said of putting out one of the eyes of Greece yet they not only reduced it to the lowest condition in point of political consequence but even altered the form of its government for they compelled the people to abolish the democracy and submit to the government of thirty men who were commonly known by the name of the thirty tyrants The Greeks indeed were sufficiently disposed to give that name to men of virtuous characters but these rulers of Athens who were the mere creatures of Lysander appear to have deserved in every respect the most opprobrious appellation Instead of compiling and publishing a more perfect body of laws which was the pretence for their being chosen they began to exercise their power of life and death and though they appointed a senate and other magistrates they made no farther use of them than to confirm their own authority and see their  commands executed At first it is true they proceeded with some caution and condemned only the most profligate sort of citizens viz such as lived by informing and giving evidence against their neighbours but this was only to blind the eyes of the populace their real design was to make themselves absolute and as they well knew that this could not be done without a foreign power they next contrived to have a guard sent them from Sparta This guard was commanded by one Callibius whom they soon won over to their designs and from this time forward they proceeded to act without controul filling the city with the blood of those who on account of their riches interest or good qualities were most likely to oppose them  One of their first acts of cruelty was to procure the death of Alcibiades who had taken refuge in the dominions of Persia This man though driven from his country did not cease to interest himself in  welfare and the tyrants dreading that by his popularity at Athens where he was still much beloved he would thwart all their schemes entreated the Lacedaemonians to rid them of so formidable an opponent This request the Lacedaemonians had the meanness to comply with and accordingly wrote to Pharnabasus the Persian governor for that purpose and he in his turn was no less base and unprincipled for without having received any personal injury from Alcibiades he readily promised to take him out of the way The manner of this great man's death did not disgrace the high character for courage he had maintained during life The assassins sent against him were afraid to attack him openly They therefore surrounded the house in which he was and set it on fire Alcibiades forced his way through the flames sword in hand and drove the barbarians before him not one  of whom had the courage to oppose him but all of them discharging their darts and javelins upon him from a distance he at last fell covered with wounds and instantly expired Timandra his mistress took up his body and having covered and adorned it with the finest robes she had she made as magnificent a funeral for it as her present circumstances would allow To what we have already said of Alcibiades it may not be improper to add that his great popularity wherever he resided was principally owing to the extreme versatility of his genius and the surprising facility with which he accommodated himself to the manners and customs of different people for in this respect no man ever exceeded or perhaps even equalled him Plutarch says that at Sparta he was hardy frugal and reserved in Ionia luxurious indolent and gay and when transacting affairs with the king of Persia's lieutenants he surpassed even these men themselves in pomp and magnificence  The tyrants though eased of their apprehensions from this quarter began to dread an opposition from another that is from the general body of the people whom they well knew to be dissatisfied with their conduct and they therefore invested three thousand citizens with some part of their power and by their assistance kept the rest in awe Encouraged now by such an accession of strength they soon proceeded to still greater extremities than any they had hitherto ventured on they agreed to single out every one his man to put him to death and seize their estates for the maintenance of their guard Theramenes one of their number was the only man that was struck with horror at their proceedings Critias therefore the principal author of this detestable resolution thought it necessary to  ake him out of the way and he accordingly accused him to the senate of endeavouring to subvert  the government Sentence of death was immediately passed upon him and he was obliged to drink the juice of hemlock the usual mode of execution at that time in Athens Socrates whose disciple he had been was the only person of the senate who ventured to appear in his defence he made an attempt to rescue him out of the hands of the officer of justice and after his execution went about as it were in defiance of the thirty exhorting and animating the senators and citizens against them  The tyrants thus freed from the opposition of a  colleague whose presence alone was a continua  reproach to them set no longer any bounds to their cruelty and rapacity Nothing was now heard o  but imprisonments confiscations and murders▪ every one trembled for himself or his friends▪ and amidst the general consternation which had seized the citizens on account of their personal danger all hope seems to have been lost of reco+vering public liberty  The Lacedaemonians not content with support+ing the thirty tyrants in the exercise of their cru+elty were unwilling to let any of the Athenian  escape from their hands They published an edi  to prohibit the cities of Greece from giving the  refuge decreed that such of them as fled should b  delivered up to the thirty and condemned all tho  who contravened this edict to pay a fine of five talent▪ Two cities only Megara and Thebes rejecte  with disdain so unjust an ordinance The latt  went still further and published a decree th  every house and city in Boeotia should be open a  free for any Athenian that desired protection a  that whoever did not assist a fugitive Athenian  was seized should be fined a talent Thrasybu  a man of an admirable character who had  deplored the miseries of his country was now  first to relieve it At Thebes he held a cons  +tation  with his fellowcitizens and the result was that some attempt with whatever danger it might be attended should certainly be made for restoring the public liberty Accordingly with a party of thirty men only as Nepos says but as Xenophon more probably relates of near seventy he seized upon Phyle a strong castle on the frontiers of Attica This enterprize alarmed the tyrants who immediately marched out of Athens with their three thousand followers and their Spartan guard and attempted the recovery of the place but were repulsed with loss Finding they could not carry it by a sudden assault they resolved upon a siege but not being sufficiently provided for that purpose and a great snow falling in the night they were forced to retire the next day into the city leaving only part of their guard to prevent any farther incursions into the country  Encouraged by this success Thrasybulus no longer kept upon the defensive but marching out of P  ple by night at the head of a thousand men made himself master of Pyraeus The thirty flew thither with their troops and a battle sufficiently warm ensued but as the soldiers on one side fought with spirit and ardour for their liberty and on the other with indolence and neglect for the power of their oppressors the victory was not long doubtful  ut followed the better cause the tyrants were  ove  thrown Critias was killed upon the spot and  s the rest of the army were taking to flight Thra  ybulus cried out  "Wherefore do you fly from me  s from a victor rather than assist me as the avenger  f your liberty we are not enemies but fellow  itizens neither have we declared war against the  ty but against the thirty tyrants"  He entreated  em to remember that they had the same origin  ountry laws and religion he exhorted them to  ty their exiled brethren to restore to them their  country and resume their liberty themselves This discourse had the desired effect The army upon their return to Athens expelled the thirty and substituted ten persons to govern in their room but whose conduct proved no better than that of their predecessors  Though the government was thus altered and the thirty deprived of their power they still had hopes of being reinstated in their former authority and sent deputies to Sparta to demand aid Lysander was for granting it to them but Pausanias who then reigned in Sparta moved with compassion at the deplorable condition of the Athenians favoured them in private and obtained a peace fo  them it was sealed with the blood of the tyrants who having taken arms to restore themselves to power were put to the sword and Athens left i  full possession of its liberty Thrasybulus the  proposed an amnesty by which the citizens engage  upon oath that all past actions should be buried i  oblivion The government was reestablished upo  its ancient footing the laws recovered their forme  vigour the magistrates were elected with the usua  ceremonies and democracy was once more restore  to this unfortunate people Xenophon says tha  this intestine commotion consumed as many i  eight months as the Peloponnesian war had done i  ten years  From Europe we must now pass over into As  which was the scene of the next great action i  which the Greeks were concerned This was  other than the famous expedition of Cyrus  younger son of Darius Nothus late king of Pers  who had long entertained hopes of being  day able to dethrone his elder brother Artaxerx  ▪ He had indeed made several attempts for this pu  +pose already and had as often been pardoned by  brother at the earnest entreaty of their mother  +rysatis  Artaxerxes carried his generosity to a still greater and even to an imprudent length for he bestowed upon Cyrus the absolute command of all those provinces that had been left him by the will of his father Cyrus no sooner found himself in this exalted situation than he began to use every art for the accomplishment of his ambitious project and with this view he engaged in his service a body of thirteen thousand Greeks under the command of Clearchus an able Lacedaemonian officer who had been banished his native country and for some time resided at the court of Cyrus These were joined by a great number of Persians from the provinces which Cyrus himself commanded as well as from those under the government of Tissaphernes where several cities had revolted in his favour The common Grecians however were entire strangers to the purpose for which they were enlisted nor was any one let into Cyrus's design but Clearchus himself When the troops therefore began their march and had advanced as far as Tarsus the Greeks refused to proceed any farther rightly susspecting that they were intended against the king and loudly exclaiming that they had not entered into the service upon that condition Clearchus had need of all his dexterity and address to stifle this commotion in its birth At first he made use of authority and force but finding these had little effect he desisted from an open opposition to the sentiments of the soldiers he even affected to enter into their views and to support them with his approbation and credit By this artful evasion he appeased the tumult and made the men easy for the present and they chose him and some others for their deputies Cyrus whom he had secretly apprized of every thing made answer that he was going to attack Abrocomas his enemy at twelve days march from thence upon the Euphrates  When this answer was reported to them though they plainly saw against whom they were going they resolved to proceed and only demanded an augmentation of their pay Cyrus instead of one daric a month to each soldier promised to give them one and a half And the more to ingratiate himself when he was told that two officers had deserted from the army and was advised to pursue and put them to death he publickly declared that it should never be said had detained any one person in his service against his will and he therefore ordered their wives and children who had been left as hostages in his army to be sent after them A conduct so wise and apparently generous had a surprizing effect in gaining the affections of the soldiers and made even those his firm adherents who before were averse to his cause  As Cyrus advanced by long marches he received intelligence from all quarters that the king did not intend to come to a battle with him directly but had resolved to wait in the interior parts of Persia till all his forces were assembled and that to stop his progress he had ordered an intrenchment to be thrown up on the plains of Babylon with a ditch of five fathoms broad and three deep extending the length of twelve parasangs or leagues from the Euphrates to the wall of Media Between the Euphrates and the ditch a way had been left of twenty feet in breadth by which Cyrus passed with his whole army having reviewed it the day before The king had neglected to dispute this pass with him and suffered him to continue his march towards Babylon  As Cyrus expected to engage every moment he took care to proceed in order of battle giving the command of the right wing of the Greeks to Clearchus and that of the left to Menon At length he discovered his brother's army amounting to  twelve hundred thousand men besides a select body of six thousand horse approaching and preparing to attack him  The place where the battle was fought was called Cunaxa about twentyfive leagues from Babylon Cyrus getting on horseback with his javelin in his hand commanded his troops to stand to their arms and proceed in order of battle The enemy in the mean time who were headed by Artaxerxes in person advanced slowly and in good order This sight extremely surprized the Greeks who expected to have found nothing but tumult and confusion in so great a multitude and to have seen them rushing on with strange and hideous outcries  The armies were not distant above four or five hundred paces when the Greeks began to sing the hymn of battle and to march on softly at first and with silence When they came near the enemy they set up great cries striking their darts upon their shields to frighten the horse and then moving altogether they sprung forward upon the barbarians with all their force who did not wait their charge but took to their heels and fled universally except Tissaphernes who stood his ground with a small part of his troops  Cyrus saw with pleasure the enemy routed by the Greeks and was proclaimed king by those around him but he did not give himself up to vain joy nor as yet reckoned himself sure of the victory He peceived that Artaxerxes was wheeling his right wing to attack him in flank and marched directly against him with six hundred horse Discovering his brother he cried out with eyes sparkling with rage I see him and spurred against him followed only by his principal officers for his troops had quitted their ranks to pursue the fugitives which was a capital blunder The battle then became in some measure a single combat between Artaxerxes  and Cyrus and the two brothers were seen transported with rage and fury endeavouring like Eteocles and Polynices to plunge their swords into each others hearts to assure themselves of the throne by the death of their rival  Cyrus having forced his way through those who were drawn up before his brother joined him and killed his horse that fell with him to the ground he rose and was remounted upon another when Cyrus attacked him again gave him a second wound and was preparing to give him a third in hopes that it would prove his last The king like a lion wounded by the huntsman was only more furious from the smart and sprung forward impetuously pushing his horse against Cyrus who running headlong and without regard to his person threw himself into the midst of a flight of darts aimed at him from all sides and received a wound from the king's javelin at the same time that all the rest discharged upon him Cyrus fell dead some say by the wound given him by the king others affirm that he was killed by a Carian soldier to whom as a reward Artaxerxes granted the privilege of bearing a golden cock on the point of his spear at the head of the army The principal officers of his court resolving not to survive so good a master were all killed around him a certain proof says Xenophon that he well knew how to chuse his friends and that he was truly beloved by them Ariaeus who ought to have been the firmest of all his adherents fled with his right wing as soon as he heard of his death  Artaxerxes after having caused the head and right hand of his brother to be cut off pursued the enemy into their camp Ariaeus had not stopped there but having passed through it continued his retreat to the place where the army had encamped  the day before which was about four leagues distant  Tissaphernes after the defeat of the greatest part of his left wing by the Greeks led on the rest against them and by the side of the river passed through the lightarmed infantry of the Greeks who opened to give him a passage and made their discharges upon him as he passed without losing a man They were commanded by Episthenes of Amphipolis who was esteemed an able captain Tissaphernes kept on without returning to the charge because he perceived he was too weak and went forward to Cyrus's camp where he found the king who was plundering it but had not been able to force the quarter defended by the Greeks who saved their baggage  The Greeks on their side and Artaxerxes on his who did not know what had passed elsewhere believed each of them that they had gained the victory the first because they had put the enemy to flight and pursued them and the king because he had killed his brother beat the troops he had fought and plundered their camp The matter was soon cleared up on both sides Tissaphernes upon his arrival at the camp informed the king that the Greeks had defeated his left wing and pursued it to a great distance and the Greeks on their side learnt that the king in pursuing Cyrus's left had penetrated into the camp Upon this advice the king rallied his troops and marched in quest of the enemy and Clearchus being returned from pursuing the Persians advanced to oppose him  The two armies were very soon near each other when after several movements on both sides in order to gain the advantage of the ground they at last came to a battle and the Greeks routed the barbarians with the same facility as before They  even pursued them to a hill at a considerable distance where the enemy ventured to halt and were preparing to attack them a second time when the Persians dreading another overthrow betook themselves again to flight in the utmost disorder  As it was almost night the Greeks laid down their arms to rest themselves much surprized that neither Cyrus or any from him appeared and imagining that he was either engaged in the pursuit of the enemy or was making himself master of some important place for they were still ignorant of his death and the defeat of the left wing of the army they determined to return to their camp and found the greatest part of the baggage taken with all the provisions and four hundred waggons laden with corn and wine which Cyrus had expressly caused to be carried along with the army for the Greeks in case of any pressing necessity They passed the night in the camp the greatest part of them without any refreshment concluding that Cyrus was alive and victorious But when they heard of his death they sent to Ariaeus as conqueror and commander in chief to offer him the Persian crown Meanwhile the king also considering himself as conqueror sent to them to surrender their arms and implore his mercy representing to them at the same time that as they were in the heart of his dominions surrounded with vast rivers and numberless nations it would be impossible for them to escape his vengeance and therefore they had no other choice left but to submit to the present necessity  Upon debating among themselves what answer they should return Proxenus desired to know of the heralds upon what terms the king demanded their arms if as a conqueror it was in his power to take them if upon any other footing what would he give them in return He was seconded by Xenophon who said that they had nothing left but  their arms and their liberty and that they could not preserve the one without the other Clearchus observed to the same effect that if the king was disposed to be their friend they should be better able to serve him with their arms than without if their enemy they should have need of them for their defence Some indeed spoke a milder language that as they had served Cyrus faithfully they would also serve Artaxerxes if he would employ them and provided he would at the same time put them in possession of Egypt At last it was agreed that they should remain in their present situation without either advancing or retreating and that if they did either it should be looked upon as a declaration of war so that the treaty seems to have been managed in such a manner as to avoid giving a direct answer and merely to amuse the king and gain time  While this affair was in agitation they received Ariaeus's answer that there were too many great men in Persia to let him quietly possess the throne for which reason he intended to set out early the next morning on his return to Greece and that it they had a mind to accompany him they must join him that night in his camp which they accordingly all did except Milthocytus a Thracian who went over with a party of three hundred men and forty horse to the king The rest in conjunction with Ariaeus's forces decamped by break of day and continued their march until sunset when they discovered from the neighbouring villages that the king was in pursuit of them  Clearchus who had the command of the Greeks ordered his men to halt and prepared for an engagement The king of Persia intimidated by so resolute a conduct sent heralds not to demand their surrender but to propose terms of accommodation When Clearchus was informed of their arrival he  ordered his attendants to bid them wait and to tell them that he was not yet at leisure to hear them He purposely put on an air of haughtiness and grandeur to denote his intrepedity and at the same time to shew the fine appearance and good condition of his troops When he advanced with the most shewy of his officers expressly chosen for the purpose and had heard what the heralds had to say he made answer that they must begin with giving battle because his men being in want of provisions they had no time to lose The heralds having carried back this message to their master returned immediately which shewed that the king or whoever spoke in his name was not far off They said they had orders to conduct them to villages where they would find plenty of provisions and conducted them thither accordingly  After three days stay Tissaphernes arrived and insinuated to them the good offices he had done them with his master Clearchus vindicated himself and his men by alledging that they were engaged in this expedition without knowing the enemy against whom they were to fight that they were free from all engagements and would commit no act of hostility against the Persian king if he would allow them to return quietly Tissaphernes assured them that they should meet with no obstruction on the contrary that they should be supplied with all kinds of provisions in their march and the more effectually to ensure their safety that he himself would accompany them on the way But this satrap's duplicity was equal to his cruelty For the barbarian army always encamping at about a league's distance from the Grecians left some room for suspicion and when they were arrived on the banks of the river Zabatus Tissaphernes pretended that some of Clearchus's principal officers had endeavoured to sow jealousies between the two armies  and that if he would bring them to his tent the next day he would point out the persons he had in his eye Clearchus was so weak as to agree to this proposal and accordingly he together with Menon Proxenes Agis and Socrates went to the Persian general's tent where they had no sooner arrived than on a signal given they were instantly seized their attendants put to the sword and themselves after being sent bound to the king were beheaded in his presence  The consternation of the Greeks upon being informed of this massacre of their generals may be more easily conceived than described They were now near two thousand miles from home surrounded with great rivers extensive forests and inimical nations without any supplies of provisions In this forlorn condition they were almost overwhelmed with despair and could think of taking neither refreshment nor repose but they recovered some faint hopes when they began to reflect upon the abilities of Xenophon a young Athenian who had accompanied Proxenes into Asia and had hitherto served as a volunteer in the army This was that Xenophon afterwards so famous as an historian and his conduct seemed equal to his eloquence in which he surpassed all the rest of mankind This young soldier went to some of the Greek officers in the middle of the night and represented to them that they had no time to lose that it was of the last importance to prevent the bad designs of the enemy that however small their number they would render themselves formidable if they behaved with boldness and resolution that valour and not multitudes determines the event of battles and that it was necessary above all things to nominate generals immediately because an army without commanders is like a body without a soul A council was immediately held at which an hundred  officers were present and Xenophon being desired to speak explained at large the reasons he had at first but slightly touched upon and by his advice commanders were appointed They were Timasion for Clearchus Xanthicles for Socrates Cleanor for Agis Philesius for Menon and Xenophon for Proxenes  Before break of day they assembled the army The generals made speeches to animate the men and Xenophon among the rest  "Fellow soldiers said he the loss of so many brave men by vile treachery and the being abandoned by our friends is very deplorable but we must not sink under our misfortunes and if we cannot conquer let us resolve rather to perish gloriously than fall into the hands of barbarians who would inflict upon us the greatest miseries let us call to mind the glorious battles of Plataea Thermopylae Salamis and many others wherein our ancestors though with a small number have fought and defeated the innumerable armies of the Persians and thereby rendered the name alone of Greeks for ever formidable It is to their invincible valour we owe the honour we possess of acknowledging no masters upon earth but the gods nor any happiness but what consists with liberty Those gods the avengers of perjury and witnesses of the enemy's treason will be favourable to us and as they are offended by the violation of treaties and take pleasure in humbling the proud and exalting the humble they will also follow us to battle and combat for us For the rest fellowsoldiers we have no refuge but in victory which must be our hope and will make us ample amends for whatever it costs us to attain it And I should think if it were your opinion that for the making a more ready and less difficult retreat it would be proper to rid ourselves of all the useless baggage and to keep only what is absolutely  necessary in our march"  All the soldiers that moment lifted up their hands to signify their approbation of what had been said and without loss of time set fire to their tents and baggage such of them as had too much equipage giving it to others who had too little and destroying the rest  The van was led by Cherisophus the Spartan general and Xenophon with Timasion brought up the rear They directed their march towards the heads of the great rivers in order to pass them where they where fordable But they had not advanced far before they were overtaken by a party of the enemy's archers and slingers commanded by Mithridates which galled their rear and wounded several of them who being heavy armed and without cavalry could make no resistance To prevent the like inconvenience Xenophon furnished two hundred Rhodians with slings and mounted fifty more of his men upon baggage horses so that when Mithridates came up with them a second time and with a much greater body he was repulsed with loss and the Greeks made good their retreat to the city of Larissa on the banks of the Tigris From thence they marched to another desolate city called Mepsila and about four leagues from that place Tissaphernes came up to them with his whole army but after several skirmishes was obliged to retire They afterwards met with some obstruction in passing an eminence which the enemy had seized but from this they soon found means to dislodge them and descended into the plain on the other side  Their difficulties however seemed to multiply as they advanced for they were now hemmed in on the one hand by the river Tigris and on the other by almost impassable mountains inhabited by the Carduci a fierce and warlike people who as Xenophon says had in these dangerous passes entirely destroyed an army of an hundred and twenty  thousand Persians But as they had no boats to cross the river and as the road through the mountains led into the rich plains of Armenia they resolved to pursue their march that way The Carduci soon took the alarm but not being prepared to oppose the Greeks in a body they possessed themselves of the tops of the rocks and mountains and from thence annoyed them with darts and great stones which they threw down upon them as they passed through the defiles where they were likewise attacked by several other parties and though their loss was not considerable yet what with storms and famine besides seven days tedious march and being continually forced to fight their way they underwent here much greater hardships than any they had hitherto suffered  Not far from the foot of the mountain they met with a fresh obstruction The river Centrites about two hundred feet in breadth presented itself before them Twice did they attempt to cross it at first without success on account of the depth of the water but the second time they were more fortunate and at length got to the other side  They now proceeded with less interruption passed the Tigris near its source and arrived at the little river Teleboa which is the boundary of the Western Armenia This province was governed by Tiribasus a great favourite of the king and who had the honour to help him to mount on horseback when at Court He offered to let the army pass and to furnish the men with the necessary provisions provided they abstained from all acts of hostility and this proposal was accepted and ratified on both sides Tiribasus however kept a flying camp at a small distance from the army There fell at the same time a great quantity of snow which put the troops to some inconvenience and they learnt from a prisoner that Tiribasus intended to attack  them in a defile of the mountains through which they must necessarily pass They took care however to prevent him by seizing that post after having routed the enemy After some days march through the desert they passed the Euphrates near its head not having the water above their middle  They were afterwards incommoded by a north wind which blew in their faces and prevented respiration so that it was thought necessary to sacrifice to the wind upon which we are told it began to abate They proceeded through the snow five or six feet deep which killed several servants and beasts of burden besides thirty soldiers They made fires in the night for they found plenty of wood All the next day they continued their march through the snow when many of them from long fasting followed with languor or fainting fell down upon the ground through weakness and want of spirits but when something had been given them to eat they found themselves relieved and resumed their march  After a march of seven days they arrived at the river Araxes otherwise called the Phasus which is about one hundred feet in breadth Two days after they discovered the Phasians the Chalybes and the Taochians who had seized the pass of the mountains to prevent their descending into the plain Xenophon however observed that they defended only the ordinary passage and by his advice therefore a party was sent to take possession of the heights which commanded that passage by which means the enemy were soon dislodged and the road effectually cleared Thus after a march of twelve or fifteen days more they arrived at a very high mountain called Tecqua from whence they descried the sea The first who perceived it raised great shouts of joy for a considerable time which made Xenophon imagine the vanguard was  attacked and he therefore advanced to support it with the utmost expedition As he approached nearer the cry of the sea the sea was distinctly heard and the alarm changed into joy and exultation and when they came to the top nothing was heard but a confused noise of the whole army crying out together the sea the sea whilst they could not refrain from tears nor from embracing their generals and officers and then without waiting for orders they heaped up a pile of stones and erected a trophy with broken bucklers and other arms  From thence they advanced to the mountains of Colchis one of which was higher than the rest and of that the people of the country had taken possession As the ground in this pass was extremely unequal the Greeks marched in files instead of line of battle and attacking the enemy with great spirit they soon put them to flight and descended into the plain on the other side of the mountains Here a very singular accident befel them which at first threw them into some consternation for finding a number of beehives in the place and eating greedily of the honey they were suddenly seized with violent vomitings and fluxes so that those who were least ill seemed like drunken men and the rest either furiously mad or dying The earth was strewed with their bodies as after a defeat not one of them however died and the distemper ceased the next day about the same hour it began The third or fourth day the soldiers got up but in that condition which people are usually in after taking a violent medicine  Two days after the army arrived near Trebisond a Greek colony of Sinopians situated upon the Euxine or Black sea in the province of Colchis Here they lay encamped for thirty days and acquitted themselves of the vows they had made to  Jupiter Hercules and the other deities to obtain a happy return into their own country They also celebrated the games of horse and foot races and wrestling and boxing or the pancratium the whole attended with the greatest joy and solemnity Here Xenophon formed a project of settling them in those parts and founding a Grecian colony which was approved of by some but his enemies representing it to the army as only a more honourable way of abandoning them and to the inhabitants as a design to subdue and enslave the country he was obliged to give over the enterprize The noise of it however had this good effect that the natives did what they could in a friendly manner to hasten their departure advising to go by sea as the safest way and furnished them with a sufficient number of transports for that purpose  Accordingly they set sail with a fair wind and the next day got into the harbour of Sinope where Cherisophus met them with some gallies but instead of the money he had promised to pay them he only told them they should recieve their arrears as soon as they got out of the Euxine sea This answer gave them so much disgust that they resolved to put themselves under one general and they des  red Xenophon in the most pressing and affect  onate terms to accept of that command which be modestly declined and procured the appointment to fall upon Cherisophus But he did not enjoy it above six or seven days for they were no  ner arrived at Heraclea than they deposed him its refusing to exhort a sum of money from the  b  tants of that city and as this was a Greek colony Xenophon likewise refused to have any concern in the affair so that the army being disappointed in their hopes of plunder broke out into a mutiny and divided into three bodies In a little time however they were happily reunited  and encamped at the port of Calpe where they settled the command as before substituting Neon in the room of Cherisophus who died here and making it death for any one hereafter to propose the dividing of the army But being straitened for provisions they were obliged to disperse themselves up and down the country where Pharnabazus's horse being joined by the inhabitants cut five hundred of them in pieces the rest escaping to a hill were rescued and brought off by Xenophon who led them first to Chrysopolis of Chalcedon and afterwards to Byzantium  From thence he conducted them to Salmydessa to enable Seuthes prince of Thrace to recover his father's dominions of which his enemies had deprived him This prince had made great promises to Xenophon and his men if they would assist him in this important undertaking but when they had done him the service he wanted he was so far from keeping his word that he did not even give them the pay agreed on Xenophon reproached him severely with this breach of faith which however he attributed to the ill advice of his minister Heraclides who thought to make his court to his master by saving him a sum of money at the expence of every thing that ought to be dear to a prince  In the mean time Charminus and Polynices arrived as ambassador from Lacedaemon with advice that the republic had declared war against Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus that Thimbron had already embarked with the troops and that the Spartans would give a daric a month to every soldier two to each officer and four to the colonels who should engage in the service Xenophon accepted the offer and having obtained from Seuthes by the mediation of the ambassadors part of the pay due to him he went by sea to Lampsacus with the  army which amounted still after all its losses to about six thousand men From thence he advanced to Pergamus a city in the province of Troas Having met near Parthenia a great nobleman returning into Persia he took him his wife and children with all their equipage and by that means was enabled to distribute among the soldiers very handsome gratuities and to make them ample amends for all the losses they had sustained Thimbron at length arrived and having assumed the command of the troops and united them with his own he marched against Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus  Such was the end of Cyrus's expedition Xenophon who himself has written a most elegant history of it computes from the first setting out of that prince's army from the city of Ephesus to their arrival at the place where the battle was fought five hundred and thirty parasangs or leagues and fourscore and thirteen days march and in their retreat from the field of battle to Corcyra a city upon the coast of the Euxine or Black sea six hundred and twenty parasangs or leagues and one hundred and twenty days march and adding both together he says the way going and coming was eleven hundred and fiftyfive parasangs or leagues and two hundred and fifteen days march and that the whole time the army took to perform that journey including the days of rest was fifteen months  We come now to an affair of a more private and domestic but not of a less interesting nature we mean the death of Socrates one of the most amiable and exalted characters that ever appeared in the world either in ancient or modern times We have already seen this great man who was the son of a stonecutter at Athens emerging from the obscurity of his birth and giving examples of courage moderation and wisdom we have seen him saying the life of Alcibiades in battle refusing to concur in the edict which unjustly doomed the six Athenian  generals to death withstanding the proceedings o  the thirty tyrants and in a word expressing his detestation of every thing which he deemed inconsistent with the principles of honour and justice Possessed as he always was of the most unbounded philanthropy he was ready to forgive those vices in others from which he himself was in a great measure free He seemed says Libanius the common father of the republic so attentive was he to the happiness and welfare of every individual of the state But knowing how difficult it is to reform the old and to make people change those principles which from their earliest infancy they have been accustomed to hold sacred he applied himself chiefly to the instruction of youth in order to sow the seeds of virtue in a soil more likely to produce the fruits of it He had however no open school like the rest of the philosophers nor set times for his lessons he had no benches prepared nor ever mounted a professor's chair he was the philosopher of all times and seasons he taught in all places and upon all occasions in walking conversation at meals in the army in the midst of the camp and in the public assemblies of the people  Such was the man whom a faction in the city had long devoted to destruction he had been for many years before his death the object of their satire and ridicule Aristophanes the comic poet was engaged to expose him upon the stage He composed a play called the Clouds in which he introduced the philosopher in a basket uttering the most ridiculous absurdities Socrates who was present at the exhibition of his own character seemed not to feel the least emotion and as some strangers were present who desired to know the original for whom the play was intended he rose from his seat and shewed himself during the whole representation This was the first blow struck at him and it was not till twenty years after that Melitus appeared  in a more formal manner as his accuser and entered a regular process against him The two chief crimes of which he accused him were that he did not admit the gods acknowledged by the republic and introduced new divinities and that he corrupted the youth of Athens and he therefore concluded with inferring that sentence of death ought to be passed upon him  The second charge was evidently groundless How far the first was founded in truth we cannot at this distance of time pretend to determine It is not likely indeed that amidst so much zeal and superstition as then prevailed in Athens he would venture openly to oppose the received religion but it is very probable from the discourses he frequently held with his friends that in his heart he despised and laughed at their monstrous opinions and ridiculous mysteries as having no other foundation than the fables of the poets and that he had attained to the notion of the one true God the creator and preserver of the universe  As soon as the conspiracy broke out the friends of Socrat  s prepared for his defence Lysias the most able orator of his time brought him an elaborate discourse of his own composing in which he vindicated the conduct of Socrates with great fo  ce of reasoning and interspersed the whole with tender and pathetic str  kes capable of moving the most occurate hearts Socrates read it with pleasure and approved of it very much but as it was more c  nf  m  le to the rules of rhetoric than the sentiments and fortitude of a philosopher he told him plainly tha  n  t suit him Lysias asked him how it was possible for it to be well done and not to suit h  m In the s  me manner said he using according to his c  t  m a vulgar comparison that an exce  lent w  rkman might brin  me magnificent appar  or shoes embroidered  ith gold to which  nothing would be wanting on his part but which however would not suit me He persisted therefore inflexibly in the resolution not to demean himself by begging suffrages in the low abject manne  common at that time He employed neither artifice not the glitter of eloquence he had recours  to no entreaties he brought neither his wife no  children to incline the judges in his favour by their sighs and tears Nevertheless though he refused to make use of any other voice but his own in his defence or to appear before his judges in the submissive posture of a suppliant he did not behave in that manner out of pride or contempt of the tribunal it was from a noble and intrepid assurance resulting from greatness of soul and a consciousness of his own innocence so that his defence had nothing weak or timorous in it his discourse was bold manly generous without passion without emotion full of the noble sentiments of a philosopher with no other ornament than that of truth and brightened throughout with the character and language of innocence Plato who was present transcribed it afterwards and without any addition formed from it the work which he calls the apology of Socrates one of the most masterly compositions of Antiquity I shall here make an extract from it  Upon the day appointed the proceedings began in the usual form the parties appeared before the judges and Melitus spoke the worse his cause and the less provided it was with proofs the more occasion had he for art and address to cover its weakness he omitted nothing that might render the adverse party odious and instead of reasons which he could not produce he substituted the glitter of a pompous declamation Socrates in observing that he could not tell what impression the discourse of his accuser had made upon the judges  owns that for his own part he scarce knew how it had affected himself Melitus had given such artful colouring and likelihood to his arguments though there was not one word of truth in all he had advanced  "I am accused said he of corrupting the youth and of instilling dangerous maxims into them as well in regard to the worship of the gods as the rules of government You know Athenians that I never made it my profession to teach nor can envy however violent against me reproach me with ever having sold my instructions I have an undeniable evidence for me in this respect which is my poverty Always equally ready to communicate my thoughts to the rich and poor and to give them leisure to question or answer me I lend myself to every one who is desirous of becoming virtuous and if amongst those who hear me there are any that prove either good or bad neither the virtues of the one nor the vices of the other to which I have not contributed are to be ascribed to me My whole employment is to persuade the young and old against too much love for the body for riches and all other precarious things of whatever nature they be and against too little regard for the soul which ought to be the object of their affections For I incessantly urge upon you that virtue does not proceed from riches but on the contrary riches from virtue and that all the other goods of human life as well public as private have their source in the same principle  "If to speak in this manner be to corrupt youth I confess Athenians that I am guilty and deserve to be punished If what I say be not true it is most easy to convict me of falshood I see here a great number of my disciples they have only to appear But perhaps their regard for a master who was instructed them will prevent them from  declaring against me at least their fathers brothers and uncles cannot as good relations and good citizens dispense with their standing forth against me and demanding vengeance upon the corrupter of their sons brothers and nephews But these are the persons who take upon them my defence and interest themselves in the success of my cause  "Pass on me Athenians what sentence you please but I can neither repent nor change my conduct I must not abandon or suspend a function which God himself has imposed on me Now he has charged me with the care of instructing my fellowcitizens If after having faithfully kept all the posts wherein I was placed by our generals at Potidaea Amphipolis and Delium the fear of death should at this time make me abandon that in which the divine providence has placed me by commanding me to pass my life in the study of philosophy for the instruction of myself and others this would be a most criminal desertion indeed and make me highly worthy of being cited before this tribunal as an impious man who does not believe the gods  "Should you resolve to acquit me for the future I should not hesitate to make answer Athenians I honour and love you but I shall chuse rather to obey God than you and to my latest breath shall never renounce my philosophy nor cease to exhort and reprove you according to my custom by saying to each of you when you come in my way  "My good friend and citizen of the most famous city in the world for wisdom and valour are you not ashamed to have no other thought than that of amassing wealth and acquiring glory credit and dignities whilst you neglect the treasures of prudence truth and wisdom and take no pains in rendering your soul as good and perfect as it is capable of being"  "I am reproached with abject fear and meanness of spirit for being so busy in imparting my advice to every one in private and for having always avoided to be present in your assemblies to give my counsels to my country I think I have sufficiently proved my courage and fortitude both in the field where I have borne arms with you and in the senate where I opposed the unjust sentence you pronounced against the ten captains who had not taken up and interred the bodies of those who were killed or drowned in the seafight near the island of Arginusae and when upon more than one occasion I opposed the violent and cruel orders of the thirty tyrants  "What is it then that has prevented me from appearing in your assemblies It is that daemon that voice divine which you have so often heard me mention and Melitus has taken so much pains to ridicule That spirit has attached itself to me from my infancy it is a voice which I never hear but when it would prevent me from persisting in something I have resolved on for it never exhorts me to undertake any thing it is the same being that has always opposed me when I would have intermeddled in the affairs of the republic and that with the greatest reason for I should have been amongst the dead long ago had I been concerned in the measures of the state without effecting any thing to the advantage of my country  "Do not take it ill I beseech you if I speak my thoughts without disguise and with truth and freedom Every man who would generously oppose a whole people either amongst us or elsewhere and who inflexibly applies himself to prevent the violation of the laws and the commission of iniquity in a government will never do so long with impunity It is absolutey necessary for him who would contend for justice if he has any thoughts of living  to remain in a private station and never to have any concern in public affairs  "For the rest Athenians if in the extreme danger I am now in I do not imitate the behaviour of those who upon less emergencies have implored and supplicated their judges with tears and have brought forth their children relations and friends it is not through pride and obstinacy or any contempt for you but solely for your honour and for that of the whole city You should know that there are amongst our citizens those who do not regard death as an evil and who give that name only to injustice and infamy At my age and with the reputation true or false which I have would it be consistent for me after all the lessons I have given upon the contempt of death to be afraid of it myself and to belie in my last action all the principles and sentiments of my past life  "But without speaking of my fame which I should extremly injure by such a conduct I do not think it allowable to entreat a judge nor to be absolved by supplications He ought to be persuaded and convinced The judge does not sit upon the bench to shew favour by violating the laws but to do justice in conforming to them He does not swear to discharge with impunity whom he pleases but to do justice where it is due We ought not therefore to accustom you to perjury nor you to suffer yourselves to be accustomed to it for in so doing both the one and the other of us equally injure justice and religion and both are criminals  "Do not therefore expect from me Athenians that I should have recourse amongst you to means which I believe to be neither honest nor lawful especially upon this occasion wherein I am accused of impiety by Melitus for if I should influence you by my prayers and thereby induce you to violate your oaths it would be undeniably evident  that I teach you not to believe in the gods and even in defending and justifying myself should furnish my adversaries with arms against me and prove that I believe no divinity But I am very far from such bad thoughts I am more con  inced of the existence of God than my accusers and so convinced that I abandon myself to God and yet▪ that you may judge of me as you may deem best for yourselves"  Socrates pronounced this discourse with a firm and intrepid tone his air his action his visage expressed nothing of the accused he seemed the master of his judges from the assurance and greatness of soul with which he spoke without however losing any thing of the modesty natural to him But how slight soever the proofs were against him the faction was powerful enough to find him guilty By his first sentence however he was only convicted of the crimes laid to his charge but when by his answer he seemed to appeal from their tribunal to that of justice and posterity when instead of confessing himself guilty he demanded rewards and honours from the state the judges were so highly offended that they condemned him to drink the juice of hemlock the usual method of execution at that time in Athens  Socrates received this sentence with the utmost composure Apollodorus one of his disciples breaking out into invectives and lamentations that his master should die  innocent  "What replied Socrates with a smile would you have me die  guilty  Melitus and Anytus may kill but they cannot hurt me"  After his sentence he still continued with the same serene and intrepid aspect with which he had long enforced virtue and kept tyrants in awe When he entered the prison which now became the residence of probity and virtue his friends followed him thither and continued to visit him  during the interval between his condemnation and death which lasted for thirty days This long delay was owing to the following circumstance the Athenians sent every year a ship to the isle of Delos to offer certain sacrifices and it was not permitted to put any person to death in the city from the time that the priest of Apollo had crowned the poop of this vessel as a signal of her departure till she returned home so that sentence having been passed upon Socrates the day after this ceremony was performed it became necessary to defer the execution of it till the ship should arrive at Athens  In this long interval death had sufficient opportunities to present itself before his eyes in all its terrors and to put his fortitude to proof not only by the severe rigour of a dungeon and the irons upon his legs but by the continual prospect and cruel expectation of an event at which nature always recoils In this sad condition he did not cease to enjoy that profound tranquillity of mind which his friends had always admired in him He entertained them with the same cheerfulness he had always preserved and Crito says that the evening before his death he slept as quietly as at any other time He composed also an hymn in honour of Apollo and Diana and turned one of Aesop's fables into verse  So little indeed was he apprehensive of death that he absolutely refused to escape from prison when it was in his power For the day before or the same day that the ship arrived Crito his intimate friend came to him and told him that it now depended upon himself to quit the prison that the jailer was gained that he would find the doors open and that he might if he pleased enjoy a safe retreat in Thessaly Socrates laughed at this proposal and asked him whether he knew any place out of Attica where people did not die Crito urged every argument he could think of to  induce him to accept of his proffered deliverance Socrates heard him with great attention commended his zeal and thanked him for his kindness But before he would give into his opinion he was for examining whether it was just for him to depart out of prison without the consent of the Athenians The question therefore here was whether a man condemned to die though unjustly could without a crime elude the execution of the sentence that had been passed upon him Socrates held that he could not and therefore nobly refused to escape out of prison He reverenced the laws of his country and resolved to obey them in all things even in death itself  At length the fatal ship returned to Athens which was as it were the signal for the death of Socrates The next day all his friends except Plato who was sick repaired to the prison early in the morning The jailer desired them to wait a little because the eleven magistrates who had the superintendence of the prisons were at that time acquainting the prisoner that he was to die the same day Presently after they entered and found Socrates whose chains had been taken off sitting by Xantippe his wife who held one of his children in her arms As soon as she perceived them setting up great cries sobbing and tearing her face and hair she made the prison resound with her lamentations exclaiming  "Oh my dear Socrates your friends are come to see you this day for the last time"  He desired she might be taken way and she was immediately carried home  Socrates passed the rest of the day in conversing with his friends with great cheerfulness upon one of most important topics that can engage the attention of the human mind and one at the same time the best adapted to the occasion it was upon the immortality of the soul What gave rise to this  conversation was a question introduced in a manner by chance whether a true philosopher ought not to desire and take pains to die This proposition taken too literally implies an opinion that a philosopher may kill himself Socrates shews that nothing can be more unjust than this notion and that man appertaining to God who formed and placed him with his own hand in the post he occupies cannot abandon it without his permission nor depart from life without his order What is it then that can induce a philosopher to be desirous to die It can be only the hope of that happiness which he expects in ano  her life and that hope can be founded only upon the belief of the soul's immortality  Socrates employed the last day of his life in entertaining his friends upon this great and important subject from which conversation Plato's admirable dialogue intitled the Thaedon is wholly taken He explains to his friends all the arguments for believing the soul immortal and refutes all the objections against it which are very nearly the same that are made at this day  When Socrates had done speaking Crito begged he would give him and the rest of his friends his last instructions with regard to his children and other affairs that by executing them they might have the consolation of shewing their respect for his memory  "I shall recommend nothing to you this day replied Socrates more than I have already done which is to take care of yourselves you cannot give  e and my family a greater satisfaction"  Crito having asked him afterwards in what manner he would wish to be buried  "As you please said Socrates if you can lay hold of me and I escape not out of your hands"  At the same time looking on his friends with a smile  "I can never added he persuade Crito that Socrates  is he who converses with you and arranges the several parts of his discourse for he always imagines that I am what he is going to see dead in a little time he confounds me with my carcase and therefore asks me how I would be interred"  On finishing these words he rose up and went to bathe himself in a chamber adjoining After he came out of the bath his children were brought to him for he had three two very little and the other grown up He spoke to them for some time gave his orders to the women who took care of them and then dismissed them Being returned into his chamber he laid himself down upon his bed  The servant of the eleven entered at the same instant and having informed him that the time for drinking the juice of hemlock was come which was at sunset the servant was so deeply afflicted that he turned his back and fell a weeping  "See said Socrates the good heart of this man since my imprisonment he has often come to see me and to converse with me he is more worthy than all his fellows how heartily the poor man weeps for me"  The fatal cup was now brought Socrates asked what it was necessary for him to do  "Nothing more replied the servant than as soon as you have drunk off the whole draught to walk about till you find your legs grow weary and afterwards lie down upon your bed"  He took the cup without any emotion or change in his colour or countenance and regarding the man with a steady and assured look  "Well said he what say you of this drink may one make a libation of it"  Upon being told there was only enough for one dose  "At least continued he we may say our prayers to the gods as it is our duty and implore them to make our exit from this world and our last stage happy which is what I most ardently beg of them"  After having spoke these words he  kept silence for some time and then drank off the whole draught with an amazing tranquillity and serenity of aspect not to be expressed or hardly even conceived  Till then his friends had been able though with great difficulty to refrain from tears but after he had drunk the potion they were no longer masters of themselves but wept abundantly Apollodorus in particular who had been in tears almost during the whole day began then to make such loud and bitter lamentations as pierced the hearts of all that were present Socrates alone remained unmoved and even reproved his friends though with his usual mildness and goodnature  "What are you doing said he to them I wonder at you Oh what is become of your virtue Was it not for this I sent away the women that they might not fall into these weaknesses for I have always heard you say that we ought to die peaceably and blessing the gods Be at ease I beg you and shew more constancy and resolution"  He then obliged them to restrain their tears  In the mean time he kept walking to and fro and when he found his legs grow weary he lay down upon his back as he had been directed The poison then operated more and more When Socrates found it begin to gain upon the heart uncovering his face which had been covered no doubt to prevent any thing from disturbing him in his last moments  "Crito said he we owe a cock to Aesculapius discharge that vow for me and pray do not forget it"  Soon after which he breathed his last Crito went to his body and closed his mouth and eyes Such was the end of Socrates in the first year of the ninetyfifth olympiad and the seventieth of his age  It was not till some time after the death of this great man that the people of Athens perceived  as favoured the Spartan cause had taken refuge in the citadel and till these were reduced Thebes could not be said to be free But a party of five thousand foot and two thousand horse arriving next morning from Athens and several bodies of troops coming in at the same time from different parts of Boeotia Pelopidas soon found himself at the head of so powerful an army that he compelled the garrison to surrender at discretion  The Spartans though mortified were by no means dispirited with this reverse of fortune They sent an army of near twenty thousand men under Agesilaus to reestablish their power at Thebes The name of the general alone struck terror into the enemy who were afraid to meet him in the open field and they therefore took possession of a hill in the neighbourhood of the city Agesilaus sent a party to provoke them to come down and give him battle and when he saw they declined this he drew out his whole army in order to attack them But Chabrias who commanded the Theban mercenaries ordered his men to present themselves and keep their ranks close together with their shields laid down at their feet their spears advanced one leg forward and the knee upon the half bend Agesilaus finding them prepared in this manner to receive him and that they stood as it were in defiance of him thought fit to withdraw his army and contented himself with ravaging the country This was looked upon as an extraordinary stratagem and Chabrias valued himself so much upon it that he procured his statue to be erected in that posture  The Spartans had hitherto been deemed unequalled in military prowess but they now began to be rivalled and even excelled in that noble quality by the Thebans This particularly appeared in the battle of Tegyra Pelopidas the Theban general had  resolved to attack Orchomenus which was garrisoned by the Spartans and he therefore marched against it with a small party of three hundred foot and forty horse but hearing that a large body of Spartans were hastening to its relief he thought it best to retire In his retreat he fell in with this reinforcement near Tegyra and finding it impossible to avoid a battle he resolutely prepared to engage After a violent struggle which was maintained with equal bravery on both sides Gorgoleon and Theopompus the two Spartan generals fell and this so intimidated their men that they immediately retired on either hand and opened a way for the Thebans to pass But a safe retreat could not satisfy Pelopidas Encouraged by his late success he drew up his men afresh and renewed the battle and after committing a most terrible havock among the enemy he put them to an entire rout  This was the most signal disgrace the Spartans had ever met with They had never before been known to yield even to an equal number but here they were beat by a force not one third of their own It must be acknowledged however that these three hundred foot were the flower of the Theban army They were distinguished by the name of the  sacred band  They were as remarkable for their fidelity to each other as for their strength and courage they were linked together by the bonds of common friendship and were sworn to stand by each other to the very last extremity Thus united they became invincible and generally turned the scale of victory in their favour for a number of years till at length they were cut down as one man by the Macedonian phalanx under Philip  Pelopidas was not the only nor even the greatest general that Thebes produced Epaminondas his contemporary and colleague in command was every  way his equal and if possible his superior These two great men lived in the strictest intimacy and friendship and the only cause of rivalship between them was which of them should distinguish himself most in promoting the interest or advancing the glory of their native country Epaminondas had spent the earlier part of his life in the study of philosophy remote from the management of public affairs either of a civil or military nature in neither of which he would ever engage until he was overcome by the importunites of his countrymen who thought they perceived in him amidst all his diffidence and selfdenial the seeds of many great and excellent qualities Nor were they deceived in their opinion for when he was placed as it were by force and against his will at the head of an army he shewed the world that an application to the polite arts so far from d squalifying a man for a public station only renders him capable of filling it with more distinguished lustre  Under these two excellent generals therefore Thebes was able not only to maintain its own independence but even to threaten the rest of Greece with subjection and it was probably the apprehension of this last event that had made the Athenians break off their alliance with the Thebans and join in a confederacy with the Spartans against their former allies The Spartans had long considered themselves as the umpires and arbitrators of Greece and could ill bear a rival in this boasted preeminence They therefore resolved to humble the pride of Thebes and with this view their general Cleombrotus marched towards the frontiers of Boeotia with a numerous army But in order to give an air of justice to their hostilities they first sent to demand of the Thebans that they should restore the cities they had seized to their liberties that they should rebuild those they had  demolished and make reparation for all the wrongs they had done To this it was replied  "That the Thebans were accountable to none but heaven for their conduct"  Nothing now remained on either side but to prepare for action Epaminondas immediately raised all the troops he could and began his march his army did not amount to six thousand men and the enemy had above four times that number As several bad omens were urged to prevent his setting out he replied only by repeating a verse from Homer importing that there is but one good omen to fight for one's country However to reassure the soldiers by nature superstitious and whom he perceived to be discouraged he instructed several persons to come from different places and report auguries and omens in his favour which revived the spirit and hopes of his troops  Epaminondas had wisely taken care to secure a pass which would have shortened Cleombrotus's march considerably The latter after having taken a large compass arrived at Leuctra a small town of Boeotia between Plataea and Thespiae Both parties consulted whether they should give battle which Cleombrotus resolved to do by the advice of his officers who said that if he declined fighting with such a superiority of troops it would confirm the current report that he secretly favoured the Thebans And these last on their side had an essential reason for hastening a battle before the arrival of the troops which the enemy daily expected However the six generals who formed the council of war being equally divided in their sentiments the seventh who was Pelopidas came in very good time to join the three that were for fighting and his opinion carrying the question it was at last determined to engage  The two armies as we have already said were very unequal in number The Lacedaemonians  amounted to twentyfour thousand foot and sixteen hundred horse The Thebans had only six thousand foot and four hundred horse but all of them choice troops animated by the love of glory and resolved either to conquer or die The Lacedaemonian cavalry composed of men picked up by chance without valour and ill disciplined were as much inferior to their enemies in courage as superior in number The infantry could not be depended on except the Lacedaemonians the allies having engaged in the war with reluctance because they did not approve the motive of it and being besides dissatisfied with the Spartans The ability of the generals alone supplied the place of great armies especially that of the Theban commander who was the most accomplished soldier of his time and he was nobly supported by Pelopidas who was then at the head of the sacred band  Upon the day of battle the two armies drew up on a plain Cleombrotus was upon the right at the head of the Lacedaemonians in whom he most confided and whose files were twelve feet deep The left wing consisting of the allies was commanded by Archidamus the son of Agesilaus Epaminondas took post in the left of his army and was opposed to Cleombrotus whom he was determined to attack convinced that if once he could break the Lacedaemonian phalanx the rest of the army would soon be put to flight  The action began with the cavalry which were p  sted on both sides in the front of the left wing As the Thebans were better mounted and braver troops than the Lacedaemonian horse the latter were soon broke and driven upon the infantry which they put into some confusion Epaminondas following his horse close marched swiftly up to Cleombrotus and fell upon his phalanx with all the weight of his heavy battalion The latter to make  a diversion detached a body of troops with orders to take Epaminondas in flank and to surround him▪ Pelopidas upon sight of that movement advanced with incredible speed and boldness at the head of the sacred band to prevent the enemy's design and flanked Cleombrotus himself who by that sudden and unexpected attack was put into disorder▪ The battle was very fierce and obstinate and while Cleombrotus could act the victory continued in suspence and declared for neither party But when he fell dead with his wounds the Thebans to complete the victory and the Lacedaemonians to avoid the shame of abandoning the body of their king redoubled their efforts and a great slaughter ensued on both sides The Spartans fought with so much fury about the body that at length they gained their point and carried it off Animated by so glorious an advantage they proposed to return to the charge which would perhaps have proved successful had the allies seconded their ardour but these last seeing the Lacedaemonian phalanx broken and believing all lost especially when they heard that the king was dead took to flight and drew the rest of the army after them The Thebans remained masters of the field erected a trophy and permitted the enemy to bury their dead  The Lacedaemonians had never received such a terrible blow The most bloody defeat till then had scarce ever cost them more than four or five hundred of their citizens Here they lost four thousand men of whom one thousand were Lacedaemonians and four hundred Spartans out of seven hundred who were in the battle The Thebans had only three hundred men killed among whom were four of their citizens  It is remarkable that when the news of this defeat was brought to Sparta the Ephori would not suffer the public games which were then celebrating  to be interrupted Whether this proceeded from an affectation of indifference as if they wished to represent their loss as but trifling and were desirous of concealing the real greatness of it from the people or that luxury and dissipation had then made a considerable progress even in Sparta itself it is difficult at this distance of time to determine Next day however the loss of each particular family being known the fathers and relations of those who had fallen in battle went to the temples to thank the gods and congratulated each other upon their glory and good fortune whilst the relations of those who had escaped were overwhelmed with grief and affliction  But there was another point to be determined with regard to these last They were by the law to be degraded from all honour and rendered infamous insomuch that it was a disgrace to intermarry with them they were to appear publicly in mean and dirty habits with patched and partycoloured garments and to go half shaved and whoever met them in the streets might insult and beat them without their daring to make any resistance This was so severe a law and such numbers had on this occasion incurred the penalties of it many of whom were of great families and interest that they apprehended the execution of it might excite some public commotion besides that these citizens such as they were could very ill be spar  d at this time when they wanted to recruit the army Under this difficulty they gave Agesilaus a power even over the laws to dispense with them to abrogate them or to enact such new ones as the present emergency required He would not abolish or alter the law He only made a public declaration that it should lie dormant for that single day but revive and be in full force again on the morrow and by that expedient he saved the citizens from infamy  It was not long before the Spartans felt the consequences of this dreadful overthrow Numbers of Greek cities that had hitherto remained neuter now declared in favour of the Thebans and increased their army to the amount of seventy thousand men With this mighty force Epaminondas entered Laconia and overran the open country He did not however attempt any thing against Sparta itself but he reinstated the Arcadians in all their ancient rights and privileges of which they had been deprived by the Spartans and he enabled them to build a new city which from the name of the old one was called Messenia  So jealous were the ancient Greeks of every the least encroachment on their liberty that no action however great or meritorious in other respects was sufficient to atone for it This was signally exemplified in the case of Pelopidas and Epaminondas who upon their return home instead of being recieved as heroes and conquerors were summoned as criminals before a court of justice to answer for their conduct in having retained their command four months beyond the time limited by law This offence was capital by the laws of Thebes and those who stood up for the constitution were zealous for having it adhered to on the present occasion Pelopidas was the first cited before the tribunal He defended himself with less strength and greatness of mind than was expected from a man of his character by nature warm and fiery That valour which was haughty and intrepid in fight forsook him before his judges His air and discourse which had something timid and low in it denoted a man who was afraid of death and did not in the least incline the judges in his favour who nevertheless acquitted him though not without difficulty  Epaminondas on the contrary appeared with all the confidence of conscious innocence Instead of justifying himself he enumerated his actions he related in haughty terms in what manner he had ravaged Laconia reestablished Messenia and delivered the Arcadians He concluded with saying that he should die with pleasure if the Thebans would relinquish the sole glory of those actions to him and declare that he had done them by his own authority and without their participation All the voices were in his favour and he returned from his trial as he used to do from battle with glory and universal applause Such dignity has true valour that it in a manner seizes the admiration of mankind by force This bold and manly deportment had so good an effect that his enemies declined any further prosecution and he and his colleague were honourably acquitted His enemies however jealous of his glory were determined to mortify him and with this view procured him to be elected the city scavenger but he accepted the place with thanks and declared that instead of thinking himself disgraced by the office he would render it honourable by his manner of discharging it  In the mean time the Spartans struck with consternation at their late defeat applied to the Athenians for succour and that people notwithstanding their jealousy of their old rivals engaged to assist them with all their forces They likewise had recourse to the Persian king for the same purpose but Pelopidas undertaking an embassay to the court of that prince prevailed upon him to remain neuter  Soon after Pelopidas was sent with an army against Alexander king of Pherae one of the most bloodthirsty tyrants that ever existed and who had for some time given great disturbance to the  whole country of Thessaly This savage had caused several people to be buried alive and others to be dressed in bears and boars skins and then baited them with dogs or shot at them for diversion This monster however Pelopidas compelled to submission and even endeavoured by mild usage to reform the natural brutality of his temper but Alexander instead of being grateful for the salutary counsels that were given him resolved to take the first opportunity of being revenged on his benefactor Nor was it long before such an occasion offered for Pelopidas being appointed ambassador to Alexander was treacherously seized upon and made prisoner contrary to all the laws of nations and humanity It was in vain that the Thebans complained of this violation of laws it was in vain they sent a powerful army but headed by indifferent generals to revenge the insult their army returned without effect and Alexander treated his prisoner with great severity It was reserved for Epaminondas to bring the tyrant to reason Entering Thessalia at the head of a powerful army his name spread such terror that the tyrant offered terms of submission and delivered up Pelopidas from prison  Pelopidas was scarce set at liberty when he resolved to punish the tyrant for his perfidy and breach of faith He led a body of troops against him to a place called Cynocephalus where a bloody battle ensued in which the Thebans were victorious but Pelopidas was unfortunately slain and his countrymen considered those successes as very dearly earned which were purchased at the expence of his life His death was equally lamented by the Thebans and Thessalians who begged and obtained the honour of performing his funeral rites which were very grand and magnificent Alexander himself was soon after killed by his wife Thebe and her three brothers who long shocked at his cruelties  had resolved to rid the world of such a monster It is said that his whole palace was every night filled with guards except his bedchamber which was an upper room guarded by a dog and ascended by a ladder Thebe allured away the dog and covered the steps of the ladder with wool to prevent noise and then her three brothers ascending one of them seized him by the feet and another by the hair and the third stabbed him to the heart  In the mean time the war between the Thebans and Spartans was carried on with unabated vigour The Theban troops were commanded by their favourite general Epaminondas Agesilaus the only man in Greece then capable of opposing him was at the head of the Spartans The first attempt of Epaminondas in this campaign shewed his great abilities and his skill in the art of war Hearing that Agesilaus had begun his march for Mantinea and had left but few citizens to defend Sparta at home he marched directly thither by night with a design to take the city by surprize as it had neither walls nor troops to protect it But luckily Agesilaus had got scent of his design and dispatched one of his horse to apprize the city of its danger soon after which he himself arrived with a powerful succour and he had scarce entered the town when the Thebans were seen crossing the Eurotas and advancing against the city Epaminondas finding that his design was discovered thought it below his character to retire without making some attempt He therefore employed valour instead of stratagem and attacking the city at several quarters penetrated as far as the public place and made himself master of that part of Sparta which lay upon the hither side of the river Agesilaus exerted himself with greater activity than could have been expected from one of his years He saw well that it was not now a time as before to spare himself and to  act only upon the defensive but that he had need of all his courage and intrepidity to repel such an assailant His son Archidamus at the head of the Spartan youth behaved with incredible bravery wherever the danger was greatest and with his small troop stopped the enemy and made head against them on all sides  A Spartan youth named Isadas filled not only his countrymen but even the enemy with admiration of his valour He had a beautiful face an elegant shape an advantageous stature and was just in the prime of youth he had neither armour nor clothes upon his body which shone with oil Upon the first alarm he ran out of his house with a spear in one hand and a sword in the other and rushing into the thickest of the enemy he bore down all before him laying numbers dead at his feet without himself receiving the least wound Whether the enemy were confounded at the sight as thinking him something more than human or whether says Plutarch the gods took pleasure in preserving him on account of his extraordinary valour remains a question His gallantry however was so much admired that the Ephori decreed him a garland but they afterwards fined him a thousand drachmas for having gone out to battle without armour  Epaminondas having failed in his design upon Sparta was determined to strike some other blow that might compensate for his miscarriage Hearing therefore that in order to protect Sparta al  the troops had been withdrawn from Mantinea hi  resolved to march thither without delay But a  he intended to attack the town he dispatched  troop of horse to view its situation and to clea  the fields of stragglers A little however befor  they reached Mantinea an army of six thousan  Athenian auxiliaries arrived by sea who withou  allowing either themselves or their horses any re+freshment  rushed out of the city and attacked and defeated the Theban horse In the mean time Epaminondas was advancing with his whole army with the enemy close upon his rear Finding it impossible to accomplish his purpose before he was overtaken he determined to halt and give them battle He had now got within a short way of the town which has had the honour of giving its name to the conflict of that day a conflict the most splendid and the best contested that is to be found in the history of Greece or perhaps in that of any other country The Greeks had never fought among themselves with more numerous armies the Lacedaemonians amounted to above twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse the Thebans to thirty thousand foot and three thousand horse  Epaminondas marched in the same order of battle in which he intended to fight that he might not be obliged when he came up with the enemy to lose in disposing of his army a precious time which cannot be recovered He did not march directly and with his front to the enemy but in a column upon the hills with his left wing foremost as if he did not intend to fight that day When he was over against them at a quarter of a league's distance he made the troops halt and lay down their arms as if he designed to encamp there The enemy in effect were deceived by this step and reckoning no longer upon a battle they quitted their arms dispersed themselves about the camp and suffered that ardour to cool which the near approach of a battle is wont to kindle in the hearts of soldiers  Epaminondas took advantage of this supine conduct of the enemy By suddenly wheeling his troops to the right he changed his column into a line and having drawn out his choice troops he made them double their files upon the front of his  left wing in order to add to its strength and enable it to attack in a point the Lacedaemonian phalanx which by the movement he had made faced it directly He ordered the center and right wing of his army to move very slow and to halt before they came up with the enemy that he might not hazard the event of the battle upon troops of which he had no great opinion  He expected to decide the victory with that body of chosen troops which he commanded in person and which he had disposed in a column to attack the enemy in the form of a wedge He was persuaded that if he could penetrate the Lacedaemonian phalanx in which the enemy's chief strength lay he should find it no difficult matter to rout the rest of the army by charging upon the right and left with his victorious troops  To prevent the Athenians in the left wing from coming to the support of their right against his intended attack he made a detachment of his horse and foot advance out of the line and posted them upon a rising ground in readiness to flank the Athenians if they should venture to advance to sustain their right  After having drawn up his army in this manner he moved on to charge the enemy with the whole weight of his column They were greatly surprized when they saw Epaminondas advancing towards them in this order and immediately flew to their arms bridled their horses and made all the haste they could to their ranks  While Epaminondas was marching against the enemy the cavalry that covered his flank on the left the best at that time in Greece consisting entirely of Thebans and Thessalians had orders to attack the enemy's horse The contest here was violent but not long The Lacedaemonian horse were soon repulsed and obliged to take refuge behind  their infantry In the mean time Epaminondas with his body of foot had charged the Lacedaemonian phalanx The troops fought on both sides with incredible ardour▪ both the Thebans and Lacedaemonians being resolved to perish rather than yield the glory of arms to their rivals They began fighting with their spears but these being soon broken in the fury of the combat they charged each other sword in hand The resistance was equally obstinate and the slaughter very great on both sides Despising danger and desirous only of distinguishing themselves by the gallantry of their conduct the men chose rather to die in their ranks than lose a step of their ground  This terrible slaughter having continued for some time without the victory inclining to either side Epaminondas to turn the scale in his own favour determined to make an extraordinary effort in person without regard to the danger of his own life He formed therefore a troop of the bravest and most resolute about him and putting himself at the head of them made a vigorous charge upon the enemy where the fight was hottest and wounded the general of the Lacedaemonians with the first javelin he threw The troops by his example having wounded or killed all that stood in their way broke and penetrated the phalanx The Lacedaemonians dismayed by the presence of Epaminondas and overpowered by the weight of that intrepid party were obliged to give ground The bulk of the Theban army animated by their general's example and success drove back the enemy upon their right and left and made great havoc among them But some troops of the Spartans perceiving that Epaminondas was carried away by his ardour suddenly rallied and returning to the charge overwhelmed him with a shower of javelins While he kept off part of those darts shunned some of  them fenced off others and was fighting with the most heroic valour a Spartan named Callicrates gave him a mortal wound with a javelin in his breast across his cuirass The wood of the javelin being broke off and the iron head remaining in the wound the torment was intolerable and he fell immediately The battle began around him with redoubled fury the one side exerting their utmost efforts to take him alive and the other to save him The Thebans at last gained their point and carried him off after having put the enemy to flight  After several different movements and alternate losses and advantages the troops on both sides stood still and rested upon their arms and the trumpets of the two armies as if by mutual consent sounded the retreat at the same time Each party pretended to the victory and erected a trophy the Thebans because they had defeated the right wing and remained masters of the field the Athenians because they had cut the general's detachment in pieces and from this point of honour both sides at first refused to ask leave to bury their dead which with the ancients was confessing their defeat The Lacedaemonians however sent first to demand that permission after which the rest had no thoughts but of paying the last duties to the slain  In the mean time Epaminondas had been carried into the camp The surgeons after having examined the wound declared that he would expire as soon as the head of the dart was drawn out of it These words filled all that were present with the deepest affliction who were inconsolable on seeing so great a man upon the point of expiring For him the only concern he expressed was about his arms and the fate of the battle When they shewed him his shield and assured him that the Thebans had gained the victory turning towards  his friends with a calm and serene air  "All then is well"  said he and soon after upon drawing the head of the javelin out of his body he expired in the arms of victory  As the glory of Thebes rose with Epaminondas so it fell with him and he is perhaps the only instance of one man's being able to inspire his countrymen with a love of military fame without having had a predecessor or leaving an imitator of his example  The battle of Mantinea was followed by a peace which was ratified by all the states of Greece except Sparta the conditions of it were that every state should retain what they possessed and hold it independent of any other power Nothing remarkable happened for some time after this except an expedition of Agesilaus into Egypt whither he went to assist Tachos who had usurped the throne of that kingdom Upon his arrival in Egypt every one was eager to see a man who had acquired so splendid a reputation Accordingly great multitudes of people flocked to the place where he was but how much were they surprized when instead of an elegant portly figure they found a little old man lying on the grass with his clothes threadbare and his hair uncombed They were still more astonished upon their offering him presents of perfumes and other Egyptian luxuries  "Give these things" said he "to my helots Spartan freemen know not how to use them"  Being ill used by Tachos whom he found very ungrateful he joined Nectanebus his nephew and raised him to the throne and when he in his turn was opposed by another competitor Agesilaus found means to defeat all the attempts of this last and left Nectanebus in possession of the supreme power As a reward of his services he received a present of two hundred and thirty talents of silver and was  treated besides with every mark of gratitude and respect In returning home he was driven into the haven of Menelaus which lies upon the coast of Africa where he was attacked with an acute disease and carried off being then upwards of eighty years of age forty of which he had been king  The character of Agesilaus was a compound of very different and even opposite qualities He was of a little stature and lame of a leg and indeed he was so fully convinced of the meanness of his appearance that he would never suffer any statue of him to be erected during his life and he strictly prohibited the Spartans from erecting any after his death He always paid the utmost deference to the senate and the Ephori by which means he had it in his power to execute all his designs without any opposition A rigid observer of the old Spartan plainness and frugality he was capable of enduring the greatest labour and fatigue The love of his children was a distinguished feature in his character One day when a friend found him riding with them on a hobbyhorse and expressed some surprize  "Don't" said he "say one word of this till you yourself become a father"  His generosity to his enemies was only exceeded by his partiality to his friends of the latter of which he gave a remarkable proof in his request to Idrieus prince of Caria in favour of Nicias  "If Nicias said he be innocent acquit him on his own account if guilty acquit him on mine in any event acquit him"  He had a very singular way of deceiving his enemies When about to enter upon a march he took care to publish the true account of his intended route and time of marching by which he generally had the pleasure of hearing that they had moved on a different day and taken a different road from that which they wished to take So high was his reputation both for courage and conduct  that the Spartans appointed him not only their general but likewise their admiral a mark of honour never conferred upon any one before  Of all the Greeks the Athenians were the most remarkable for their love of the polite arts and particularly for their attachment to the stage This last passion indeed they now carried to such an extravagant length that according to Plutarch it cost more to represent some of the famous pieces of Sophocles and Euripides than it had done to carry on the war against the Barbarians And in order to support this charge they seized upon the fund which had been set apart for the war with a prohibition upon pain of death ever to advise the applying of it to any other purpose They not only reversed this decree but went as far the other way making it death to propose the restoring this fund to the uses for which it had been originally raised It is not to be supposed that the other states of Greece would pay much respect to a people that were thus immersed in luxury and dissipation and accordingly many of those who had hitherto been in alliance with the Athenians now commenced hostilities against them  A J C  This war however which was soon terminated was not attended with any remarkable event except that Chabrias the Athenian general at the siege of Chio preferred his honour to his life and chose to perish in his vessel rather than abandon her In the mean time a power was growing up in Greece hitherto unobserved but now too conspicuous and formidable to be overlooked in the general picture this was that of the Macedonians a people hitherto obscure and in a manner barbarous and who though warlike and hardy had never yet presumed to intermeddle in the affairs of Greece but now several circumstances concurred to raise them from that obscurity  and to involve them in measures which by degrees wrought a thorough change in the state of Greece It will be necessary therefore to begin with a short account of their power and origin before we enter into a detail of that conspicuous part which they afterwards performed on the theatre of the world  CHAP XII FROM THE BIRTH TO THE DEATH OF PHILIP KING OF MACEDON  THE first king who is mentioned with any degree of certainty to have reigned in Macedonia was Caranus by birth an Argive and said to be the sixteenth in descent from Hercules It was upon this foundation that Philip afterwards grounded his pretensions to be of the race of Hercules and assumed to himself divine honours Caranus is commonly supposed to have led forth a body of his countrymen by the advice of the oracle into those parts where he settled and to have made himself king Caranus having according to the general account reigned twentyeight years the succession was continued after him to the times we are now treating of But there is very little worth notice recorded of these kings who were generally employed in defending themselves against the incursions of their neighbours And as to their domestic affairs they were remarkable only for the frequent murders and usurpations which happened in the royal family  Amyntas the father of Philip left two elder sons Alexander and Perdiccas both of whom possessed the throne in their turn The second of these left a son named Amyntas who while yet an  infant succeeded his father but the state of public affairs requiring a prince of mature years Amyntas was soon deposed and his uncle Philip advanced in his room  Philip began his reign in the twentyfourth year of his age and the first year of the th olympiad He had received a considerable part of his education at Thebes whither he had been carried in his youth as a hostage and he there acquired under Epaminondas that intimate acquaintance with the art of war as it was then conducted which he afterwards displayed so signally during the whole course of his reign He had now indeed occasion for all his activity and address for he was surrounded with almost as many enemies as he had neighbours The Illyrians who had seized a part of his dominions were preparing to attack him with a great army the Paeonians were making daily incursions into his territories and he had at the same time the misfortune to have two pretenders to his crown Pausanias the Lacedaemonian who was supported by the Thracians and Argaeus whom the Athenians had undertaken to assist  Under these circumstances with so many enemies on his hands at once and that before he was well settled on the throne his first care was to make sure of his own people to gain their affections and to raise their spirits for they were very much disheartened having lost above four thousand men in a battle they had lately fought with the Illyrians He succeeded in these points by his dexterity and address and still more by the force of his eloquence of which he was a great master His next step was to train and exercise them and reform their discipline and it was at this time that he instituted the famous Macedonian phalanx which did so much execution It was an improvement upon  the ancient method of fighting among the Grecians who generally drew upon their foot so close as to stand the shock of the enemy without being broken  The complete phalanx was thought to contain above sixteen thousand men though it was also taken in general for any company or party of soldiers and frequently for the whole body of foot But this of Philip's invention is described by Polybius to be an oblong square consisting of eight thousand pike men sixteen deep and five hundred in front the men standing so close together that the pikes of the fifth rank were extended three feet beyond the line of the front The rest whose distance from the front made their pikes useless rested upon the shoulders of those who stood before them and so looking them together in file pressed forward to support and push on the former ranks by which means the assault was rendered more violent and almost irresistible  Philip having settled his affairs at home and compromised all differences with such of his enemies as lay nearest to him turned his arms against the Athenians who were marched up to Methone to assist Argaeus He gave them battle and defeated them and the death of Argaeus who was killed in the action put an end to that dispute for he permitted the Athenians when they were in his power to return home This instance of his moderation gained so far upon them that they soon after concluded a peace with him which yet he observed no longer than was necessary for securing the other part of his dominions  Accordingly he marched northward and subdued first the Paeonians and afterwards the Illyrians the latter of whom he likewise compelled to restore all the conquests they had made in Macedonia He next made himself master of Amphipolis which lay upon the river Strymon and was  the key of his dominions on that quarter This place he had seized in the beginning of his reign but afterwards abandoned it in compliment to the Athenians to whom it originally belonged but now being less apprehensive of the displeasure of that people he made an entire conquest of it and added it to his dominions The Athenians however themselves he always treated with great respect whenever they fell into his hands as he particularly did upon his taking possession of Pydna and Potidaea for this last place being garrisoned by the Athenians he sent them home safe with many marks of civility  Proceeding still in his encroachments upon his neighbours he seized the city of Crenides which had been built only two years before and he now called it Philippi from his own name It was here that he discovered a gold mine which every year produced an hundred and forty fourthousand pounds sterling This which was an immense sum for that age was much more serviceable than fleets and armies in fighting his battles and he seldom failed to make use of it in every negociation It is said that consulting the oracle of Delp  os concerning the success or an intended expedition he received for answer  "That with silver spears he should conquer all things"  He took the  int and by his success verified the prediction of the oracle indeed he was less proud of the success of a battle than of a negociation well knowing that his soldiers and generals shared in the former whereas the honour of the latter was all his own  But a larger field was now opening to his ambition The mutual divisions of the states of Greece were at no time wholly cemented and they now  r  ke out upon a very particular occasion The first cause of the rupture which was afterwards called the sacred war arose from the Phocians having  ploughed up a piece of ground belonging to the temple of Apollo at Delphos Against this all the neighbouring states exclaimed as a sacrilege they were cited before the council of the Amphictyons who had the care of sacred matters and they were cast and fined in a very heavy sum This the Phocians were unable to pay they refused to submit to the decree they alledged that the care and patronage of the temple anciently belonged to them and to prove this they quoted a precedent from Homer  Philomelus one of their citizens had the chief hand in exciting them to take up arms he raised their ardour and was appointed their general He first applied himself to the Spartans who had likewise been fined by the Amphictyons for having seized the Cadmea after the battle of Leuctra For this reason they were very well disposed to join him but did not yet think proper to declare themselves openly nevertheless they encouraged him secretly and supplied him with money by which means he raised troops and without much difficulty got possession of the temple The principal opposition he met with in the neighbourhood was from the Locrians but having defeated them he erased the decree of the Amphictyons which was inscribed on the pillars of the temple Willing however to give a colour to his proceedings he thought it convenient to consult the oracle and to procure an answer in his favour But when he applied to the priestess for that purpose she refused to officiate until being intimidated by his threats she told him the God left him at liberty to act as he pleased which he looked upon as a good answer and as such took care to publish it  The Amphictyons meeting a second time a resolution was taken to declare war against the Phocians Most of the states of Greece engaged in  this quarrel and espoused the cause of the one party or the other The Thebans the Locrians the Thessalians and several other neighbouring states declared in favour of the God whilst Athens Sparta and some other cities of Peloponnesus joined with the Phocians This war which lasted for some time was not remarkable for any thing else except that which distinguishes or rather disgraces all religious wars I mean the cruelties exercised by both parties The Thebans having taken some prisoners condemned them all to die as sacrilegious wretches and the Phocians in their turn by way of reprisal inflicted the same punishment on their captives Nay Philomelus their leader being attacked on an eminence and finding it impossible to escape threw himself headlong from a rock rather than fall alive into the hands of his enemies He was succeeded by Oenomarchus  Philip did not chuse to interfere in this quarrel which it was rather his interest to encourage than suppress being well pleased to see the different states of Greece weaken one another and thus render them all an easier prey to him when he should be at leisure to attack them  It was just on the conclusion of this sacred war that  Alexander the Great  was born In his earlier years he had several masters to teach him music and other superficial accomplishments but when he grew up his father wrote to Aristotle the most celebrated philosopher of his time begging he would come and undertake the education of his son and inspire him with those sentiments of magnanimity and justice which every great man ought to possess and which no other person was so capable of inculcating He added  "I return thanks to the gods not so much for having given me a  son as for having given him to me in the age in in which Aristotle lives"  Being desirous of reducing Thrace under his dominion he determined to make himself master of Methone which obstructed his designs in that quarter He accordingly besieged it obliged it to surrender and levelled it with the ground He lost one of his eyes before this place by a very singular accident After of Amphipolis had offered him his services telling him that he was so excellent a marksman that he could bring down birds in their most rapid flight  "Well" said Philip "I will take you into my service when I make war upon starlings"  which answer stung the archer to the quick He immediately threw himself into the town and let fly an arrow on which was written  "To Philip's right eye"  This carried a most cruel proof of his skill as an archer for he hit Philip in the right eye and that prince sent him back the same arrow with this inscription  "If Philip takes the city he will hang up After"  and accordingly he was as good as his word  After this Philip marched to the relief of the Thessalians who had implored his assistance against their tyrant Lycophron the successor of Alexander of Pherae This man after having acted the part of a deliverer for some time renewed all the cruelties and barbarities of his predecessor and being supported by a large body of Phocians under Oenomarchus he thought himself secure from all opposition Philip however attacked him boldly routed his army killed six thousand men upon the field of battle and three thousand Phocians who were taken prisoners were by his order thrown into the sea as sacrilegious wretches the professed enemies of religion  Having thus freed the Thessalians he resolved to carry his arms into Phocis and with this view was going to take possession of Thermopylae the key of Greece and especially of Attica on that side but the Athenians being informed of his intention took care to be beforehand with him and sent a body of troops to occupy that pass and Philip being unwilling to come as yet to an open rupture with them thought proper for the present to relinquish his design The Athenians were roused to this exertion of spirit by the persuasion of Demosthenes the celebrated orator who from the beginning foresaw the ambitious views of Philip and the power he had of carrying them into effect  This illustrious orator and statesman whom we shall hereafter find acting so considerable a part in the course of this history was born in the last year of the ninetyninth olympiad He was the son not of a mean and obscure mechanic as Juvenal has represented him but of an eminent Athenian citizen who had raised a considerable fortune by the making of arms At the age of seven years he lost his father and to add to this misfortune the guardians to whom he was entrusted wasted and embezzled a considerable part of his inheritance The first specimen he gave of his abilities as a speaker was in pleading against these corrupt guardians though here the goodness of his cause was of more avail than the force of his eloquence for his early attempts were unpromising and soon convinced him of the necessity of a graceful and manly pronunciation In this respect indeed he laboured under impediments that at first sight might appear to be altogether insurmountable He had a stammering in his speech but this he corrected by pronouncing orations with pebbles in his mouth He had a weak and effeminate voice but th  s he strengthened by repeating speeches or verses  when he was out of breath either with running or with walking up hill He had an awkward and ungraceful gesture but this he regulated and improved by declaiming privately before a lookingglass And conscious of the natural aversion of the human mind to submit to severe study he compelled himself as it were to perform this part of his duty for having built a closet under ground for the express purpose of his improvement he sometimes confined himself there for two or three months together and in order cut off all possibility of his coming abroad shaved one half of his head while he left the other unshaved  But even all these preparations would not have been sufficient had it not been for the salutary advice and instructions of the player Satyrus This man having one day met Demosthenes overwhelmed with shame and confusion on account of his having been hissed in a public assembly of the people for his awkward and uncouth delivery desired him to repeat some verses of Sophocles which he accordingly did the other repeated them after him but with such a different tone and accent as fully convinced him that he knew very little of elocution But by the instructions of Satyrus and his own perseverance he at last attained to such perfection in the art of delivery that he surpassed all his contemporaries as much in this as he did in the more noble and sublime parts of his profession In a word he soon began to be looked upon as the standard of true eloquence insomuch that people flocked from all parts of Greece to hear him and none of his countrymen have been put in competition with him nor even among the Romans any but Cicero And though it has been made a question by the ancient writers to which of the two they should give the preference they have not ventured to decide it but have contented themselves  with describing their different beauties and shewing that they were both perfect in their kind  His eloquence was grave and austere like his temper masculine and sublime bold forcible and impetuous abounding with metaphors apostrophes and interrogations which with his solemn way of invoking and appealing to the gods the planets the elements and the manes of those who fell at Salamis and Marathon had such a wonderful effect upon his hearers that they thought him inspired In a word the councils and conduct of his countrymen were so much under his controul and he had it so much in his power to lead them into any measures he thought proper to recommend that Philip used to say he was more afraid of him than of all the fleets and armies of the Athenians and that he had no enemy but Demosthenes  Philip not chusing to attack the Athenians at present turned his arms against their allies particularly the Olynthians whom he easily subdued notwithstanding a reinforcement sent them from Athens and having taken their city he plundered it and sold the inhabitants among the rest of the spoil His two bastard brothers who were among the captives he put to death as he had formerly done the other Justin says that the protection which the Olynthians had given his brothers was the plea which he used for attacking them  In the mean time the Thebans being unable alone to terminate the war which they had so long carried on against the Phocians addressed themselves to Philip and solicited his assistance This he readily granted them being glad of so plausible a pretext for interfering in the affairs of Greece and desiring at the same time to acquire the character of a religious prince which he knew he should easily do by waging war against those who were convicted of sacrilege And in order to prevent  the Athenians from thwarting his design by sending aid to the Phocians he took care to amuse them with proposals of peace which had so good an effect that they actually sent ten ambassadors among whom were Aeschines and Demosthenes into Macedon to carry on the treaty All of these however Philip found means to corrupt except Demosthenes and he thus continued to protract the negociation until he had marched into Phocis and compelled the enemy by the terror of his name to surrender at discretion  As to the allies of the Phocians and particularly eight thousand mercenaries from Peloponnesus he allowed them to return home without molestation but the Phocians themselves were left entirely at his mercy As this however was an affair in which the Greeks in general were concerned he did not think proper to act in it by his own private authority but referred it to the Amphictyons whom he caused to be assembled for that purpose But they were so much under his influence that they served only to give a sanction to his determination They decreed that all the cities of Phocis should be be demolished that they who had fled as being principally concerned in the sacrilege should be stigmatized as accursed and proscribed as outlaws that they who remained in the towns should be dispersed in villages and obliged to pay out of their lands a yearly tribute of sixty talents until the whole of what had been taken out of the temple should be restored for it is to be observed that Philomelus their first leader had plundered the temple To add to their punishment they were adjudged to lose their seat in the council of the Amphictyons in which they had a double voice This Philip got transferred to himself which was a very material point and may be looked upon as the principal step towards his gaining that authority  which he afterwards exercised in the affairs of Greece At the same time he gained in conjunction with the Thebans the superintendency of the Pythian games which the Corinthians had forfeited for their having taken part with the Phocians Philip having in this manner accomplished his professed design did not think it prudent as yet to disclose his secret views of ambition and he therefore returned in triumph into his own country  It was about this time that he performed an act of private justice which in the eye of a philosopher ennobles his character more than all his public victories A certain soldier in the Macedonian army had in many instances distinguished himself by extraordinary acts of valour and had received many marks of Philip's favour and approbation On some occasion he embarked on board a vessel which was wrecked in a violent storm and he himself cast on the shore naked and helpless and scarcely with any signs of life A Macedonian whose lands were contiguous to the sea came opportunely to be witness of his distress and with all possible tenderness flew to the relief of the unhappy stranger He bore him to his house laid him in his own bed revived cherished comforted and for forty days supplied him freely with all the necessaries and conveniencies which his languishing condition could require The soldier thus happily rescued from death was incessant in the warmest expressions of gratitude to his benefactor and assured him of his interest with the king and of his power and resolution of obtaining for him from the royal bounty the noble returns which such extraordinary benevolence deserved He was now completely recovered and his kind host supplied him with money to pursue his journey Some time after he presented himself before the king he recounted his misfortunes magnified his services and having  looked with an eye of envy on the possessions of the man who had preserved his life was so abandoned to every sense of gratitude as to request the king to bestow upon him the house and lands where he had been so kindly and tenderly entertained Unhappily Philip without examination inconsiderately granted his infamous request and this soldier now returned to his preserver and repaid his kindness by driving him from his settlement and taking immediate possession of all the fruits of his honest industry The poor man stung with this instance of unparalleled ingratitude boldly determined to seek relief and in a letter addressed to Philip represented his own and the soldier's conduct in a lively and affecting manner The king was instantly fired with indignation he ordered that justice should be done without delay that the possessions should be immediately restored to the man whose charitable offices had been thus horribly repaid and having seized the soldier caused these words to be branded on his forehead  The Ungrateful Guest  a character infamous in every age and among all nations but particularly among the Greeks who from the earliest times were most scrupulously observant of the laws of hospitality  The next military operation which Philip undertook was against the Chersonese This peninsula had for many years belonged to the Athenians and though Cotys as king of the country had lately wrested it from them and left it to his son Chersopleptes yet he being unable to defend himself against Philip restored it to its former masters and reserved only to himself the capital city Cardia But the Cardians afraid of falling back under the dominion of the Athenians implored the protection of Philip which he readily granted them Diopithes who was the chief of the Athenian colony  lately sent to the Chersonese considered this proceeding of Philip as an act of hostility against Athens and he therefore by way of retaliation invaded the maritime parts of Thrace which Philip had lately conquered Philip sent a letter to Athens complaining of this conduct of Diopithes which he represented as an infraction of the peace and his creatures there were at great pains to shew that his complaints were well founded and that Diopithes had acted very improperly but Demosthenes in a speech which he made upon the occasion and which may be considered as the foundation of all the other orations that go by the name of Philippics proved that Diopithes had done no more than his duty and that instead of incurring the censure he c  ght to receive the thanks of his country  Philip however was no way intimidated by the wordy resistance of his eloquent antagonist but proceeding still to extend his influence among the different states of Greece he offered his protection to the Messenians and Argives who had been oppressed by the Spartans and these being soon men joined by the Thebans formed all together a very powerful confederacy The natural balance against it was an union between Athens and Sparta  ch the Spartans pressed with great eagerness  Philip and the Thebans did all they could to  ent But Demosthenes exerting himself with great spirit roused up the Athenians and put them so  their guard that without coming to an open  with Philip they obliged him for the prese  t to remain quiet  Q  et however he could not long continue He restless and enterprising spirit was ever at work He  ad long fixed his eye upon the Island of Euboea  being very conveniently situated for favouring the resign he had formed against Greece and he now  ntrived upon pretence of an invitation from  some of the inhabitants to send a body of troops thither by which means he possessed himself of several strong places dismantled Porthmos and established three tyrants or kings over the country The Athenians were conjured in this distressful situation by Plutarch of Eretria to come to the relief of the inhabitants and they accordingly dispatched a few troops thither under the command of Phocion a general of whom great hopes were entertained and whose conduct justified the high opinion the public had of him  This man would have done honour to the earliest and most uncorrupt times of the Athenian state His manners were formed in the academy according to the rules of the purest and most rigid virtue It is said that no one ever saw him laugh or weep or deviate in the least from the most settled gravity and composure He learned the art of war under Chabrias and frequently moderated the excesses and corrected the errors of that general his humanity he admired and imitated and taught him to exercise it in a more liberal and extensive manner When he had received his directions to sail with twenty ships to collect the contributions of the allies and dependent cities  "Why this force" said Phocion or if I am to meet them as enemies it is insufficient if as friends and allies a single vessel will serve"  He bore the hardships of a military life with so much ease that if ever he appeared warmly clothed the soldiers at once pronounced it the sign of a cold season His outward appearance was forbidding and his enemies taking advantage of this circumstance sometimes reproached him with his supercilious aspect and one day when Chares did so and the Athenians seemed pleased with the sarcasm Phocion quickly replied  "The sternness of my countenance never made any of you sad but the mirth of these sneerers has cost you  many a tear"  In popular assemblies his lively close and natural manner of speaking seemed as it were the echo of the simplicity and integrity of his mind and had frequently a greater effect than even the dignity and energy of Demosthenes who called him the pruninghook of his periods He studied only good sense and plain reasoning and despised every adventitious ornament He was sensible of the depravity of his countrymen and ever treated them with the utmost severity He defied their censures and so far did he affect to despise their applause that once when his sentiments extorted their approbation he turned about in surprise and asked a friend If any thing weak or impertinent had escaped him His fondness for pacific measures arose from a thorough persuasion of the degeneracy of his countrymen He saw the designs of Philip but imagined that the state was too corrupted to give him any effectual opposition so that he was according to Demosthenes in his third Philippic of the number of those men who gave up the interests of the republic not ignorantly or corruptly but from a melancholy conviction of the indispensable necessity of yielding to the fatality of the times and of submitting to an event which could not be avoided He was of consequence ever of the party opposite to Demosthenes and having been taught by experience to suspect the popular leaders considered his earnestness to rouse the Athenians to arms only as an artifice to embroil the state and by that means to gain an ascendant in the public assemblies  "Phocion" said Demosthenes "the people in some mad fit will sacrifice you to their fury"  "Yes" replied he "and you will be their victim if ever they come to their senses"  Yet they often prevailed on him to act against his judgment though never to speak against his conscience He never refused or declined the command whatever might be his opinion of the expedition  Fortyfive times was he chosen to lead their armies generally in his absence and ever without the least application They knew his merit and in the hour of danger forgot that severity with which he usually treated their inclinations and opinions  It was to him the Athenians gave the command of the forces they sent to the assistance of Plutarch But this traitor repaid his benefactors with ingratitude he set up his standard against them and endeavoured openly to repulse the very army he had requested Phocion however was not at a loss how to behave to such a renegado he pursued his enterprise won a battle and drove Plutarch from Eretria  Philip disappointed in his designs upon Euboea endeavoured to distress the Athenians in another quarter He well knew that they had most of their supplies of corn from Thrace and he therefore resolved to shut up the ports of that country against them and particularly to make himsel  master of Perinthus and Byzantium Unwilling however still to break with them entirely he took care to amuse them with professions of his regard and of his extreme reluctance to give them the least offence Nay he wrote them a letter upon the present occasion in which he strongly insinuated that they and not he were the violators of the peace  "In the times of great enmity" says he  "the most you did was to fit out ships of wa  against me and to seize and sell the merchant  that come to trade in my dominions but now yo  carry your hatred and injustice to such prodigiou  lengths as even to send ambassadors to the king o  Persia to make him declare against me"  This letter gave such of the orators as were i  Philip's interest a fine opportunity of justifyin  his conduct Demosthenes alone stood firm an  still continued to expose his artful designs and in order to remove the first impressions which the perusal of this letter might make he immediately ascended the tribunal and from thence harangued the people with all the thunder of his eloquence He told them the letter was written in a style not suitable to the people of Athens that it was a plain declaration of war against them that Philip had long since made the same declaration by his actions and  hat by the peace he had concluded with them he meant nothing more than a bare cessation of arms and to fall upon them afresh when they were more unprepared From thence he proceeded to his usual topic of reproving them for their sloth and suffering themselves to be deluded by their orators who were in Philip's pay  "Convinced of these truths" continued he "O Athenians and strongly persuaded that we can no longer say with propriety that we enjoy peace for Philip has now declared war against us by his letter as he has long since done by his conduct you ought not to spare either the public treasure or the possessions of private persons but when occasion shall require haste to your respective standards and set abler generals at your head than those you have hitherto employed for no one among you ought to imagine that the same men who have ruined your affairs will have abilities to restore them to their former happy situation Think how infamous it is that a man from Macedon should contemn dangers to such a degree that merely to aggrandize his empire he should rush into the midst of combats and return from battle covered with wounds and that the Athenians whose hereditary right it is to obey no man but to impose law on others sword in hand that the Athenians I say merely through dejection of spirit and indolence should degenerate from the  glory of their ancestors and abandon the interest of their country"  Though Phocion seldom agreed with Demosthenes in any thing he heartily assented to what he had now said He further urged the incapacity of the generals already chosen and these being rejected he himself was appointed to command the troops that were to go against Philip who was still besieging Byzantium  Phocion's conduct on this occasion did not detract from the high character he had already acquired and he was nobly supported by his officers and soldiers who had an entire confidence in his gallantry and good fortune He obliged Philip to give over the siege he drove him out of the Hellespont he took some of his ships he recovered many fortresses which he had seized and having made several descents upon different parts of his territories he plundered all the open country till a body of forces assembling to oppose him he thought proper to retire  Philip having met with so severe a check in Greece turned his arms against the Scythians whom he easily defeated but in his return from Scythia he was obliged to come to an engagement with the Triballi when he received a wound in his thigh and had his horse killed under him Alexander who accompanied him in this expedition immediately flew to his father's relief and covering him with his shield killed or put to flight al  who attacked him  The Athenians considered the siege of Byzantium as an open declaration of war and therefore in order to retaliate upon Philip they blocked u  his ports by sea and put an entire stop to his com+merce Philip at first endeavoured to appease them by offering them terms of peace which Phocion with his usual moderation advised them to accep  but Demosthenes persuaded them to reject with indignation Philip therefore began to form new alliances against them particularly with the Thebans and Thessalians but knowing how difficult it would be to persuade these powers to act directly against Athens merely on account of his personal quarrels he took care to supply them with a more plausible pretext for embracing such a measure He found means by his artifice and intrigues to sow dissensions between the Locrians of Amphissa and their capital city They were accused of impiety in having ploughed up a spot of sacred ground which lay near the temple of Apollo in the same manner as the Phocians had done upon a former occasion This spark which at first might easily have been extinguished Aeschines the most celebrated orator of his time next to Demosthenes and who was entirely in the interest of Philip contrived to blow up into a flame and by his advice a resolution was taken to send a solemn deputation to Philip inviting him to assist Apollo and the Amphictyons and to repel the outrages of the impious Amphissaeans and further to declare that he was constituted by the Greeks a member of the council of Amphictyons and general and commander of their forces with full and unlimited powers  This was the very station which Philip had long aspired to and now thought himself supremely happy in having attained Most of the inferior states of Greece approved of the conduct of the Amphictyons in giving the command of their forces to a man so eminent and illustrious for his piety and so capable of executing the vengeance of heaven The Athenians and Spartans however considered the matter in a very different light They saw that while Philip openly affected to vindicate the honour of Apollo he was secretly promoting the views of his own ambition and that under pretence  of aiding one part of the Greeks against the other he was in reality forging chains for the whole Nor was it long before their suspicions were justified by the event for Philip had no sooner assembled his forces than instead of marching as he had promised against the irreverent Locrians he made himself master of Elatea a capital city of Phocis which was very conveniently situated for awing the Thebans of whom he began to grow jealous and for opening to him a way into the heart of Attica By so extraordinary and unexpected a step he fairly threw off the mask and bade defiance as it were to the whole body of Grecians  The news of this transaction quickly spread into the neighbouring countries and wherever it came filled the minds of the people with terror and consternation They now plainly perceived the designs of Philip which his artifice and their own stupidity had hitherto concealed from their eyes but they were at a loss to know what steps they ought to take in order to render them abortive Nay even the Athenians themselves though they had long apprehended some such event were as much confounded and alarmed as their neighbours For when they met in a general assembly in order to deliberate upon the present critical situation of affairs and the herald as usual demanded with a loud voice  "which among them would ascend the tribunal"  not one of them had the courage to rise or open his mouth till at last Demosthenes animated with the greatness of the approaching danger and fired with that noble spirit of indignation which he had ever cherished and avowed against the insidious designs of Philip arose and addressed the people in the following terms  "Athenians permit me to explain the circumstances of that state which Philip has seized upon Those of its citizens whom his gold could corrupt or his artifice deceive are all at his devotion  What then is his design By drawing up his forces and displaying his powers on the borders of Thebes he hopes to inspire his adherents with courage and assurance and to terrify and controul his adversaries that fear or force may drive them into those measures which they have hitherto opposed If then we are resolved in this conjuncture to cherish the remembrance of every act of unkindness which the Thebans have done to Athens if we regard them with suspicion as men who have ranged themselves on the side of our enemy in the first place we shall act agreeably to Philip's warmest wishes and then I am apprehensive that the party who now oppose him may be brought over to his interest the whole city submit unanimously to his direction and Thebes and Macedon fall with their united force on Attica Grant the due attention to what I now propose let it be calmly weighed without dispute or cavil and I doubt not but my counsels may direct you to the best and most salutary measures and dispel the dangers now impending over the state What then do I recommend First shake off that terror which hath possessed your minds and instead of fearing for yourselves let the Thebans be the objects of your apprehensions they are more immediately affected they are the first to feel the dangers In the next place all those of the age for military service both infantry and cavalry should march instantly to Eleusis that Greece may see that you also are assembled in arms and your friends in Thebes be emboldened to assert their rights when they are assured that as they who have sold their country to the Macedonians have a force at Elatea to support them so you are ready to assist the men who bravely contend for liberty In the last place I recommend to you to nominate ten ambassadors who with the generals may have full authority to  determine the time and all other circumstances of this march When these ambassadors arrive at Thebes how are they to conduct this great affair This is a point worthy of your most serious attention Make no demands on the Thebans at this conjuncture it would be dishonourable assure them that your assistance is ready for their acceptance as you are deeply concerned for their danger and have been so happy as to foresee and to guard against it It they approve of your sentiments and embrace your overtures we shall effect one great purpose and act with a dignity worthy of our state But should it happen that we are not so successful whatever misfortunes may befal them to themselves alone they shall be imputed while your conduct shall appear in no one instance inconsistent with the honour and renown of Athens"  This speech dictated by the feelings of a patriotic heart and delivered with all that fire and vehemence for which the orator was so remarkable immediately produced the desired effect The Athenians determined to follow the advice that had been now given them they appointed Demosthenes himself to head the embassy to be sent to Thebes and they resolved to fit out a fleet of two hundred sail to cruize near Thermopylae  Upon his arrival at Thebes Demosthenes found himself opposed by one Python a man of considerable abilties whom Philip had purposely sent thither to counteract the designs of the Athenian orator This however he was not able to effect The masculine eloquence of Demosthenes carried all before it and inspired the Thebans with so strong a passion for liberty that they resolved to join their forces with those of the Athenians in preventing the further progress of the Macedonian arms  Philip disconcerted by the union of two such powerful states sent ambassadors to the Athenians requesting  them to desist from their warlike preparations but finding them determined to adhere to their engagements with Thebes he endeavoured to intimidate both them and and their allies with omens and predictions which he took care to procure from the priestess of Apollo Demosthenes however persuaded them to pay no regard to these ridiculous oracles He told them the priestess Philipized thereby insinuating that it was Philip's money that inspired her and that opened her mouth and made her draw from Apollo whatever answers she thought proper He bade the Thebans remember their Epaminondas and the Athenians their Pericles who considered these oracles and predictions as idle scarecrows and consulted only their reason The Athenian army set out immediately and marched to Eleusis and the Thebans surprised at the diligence of their confederates joined them and waited the approach of the enemy  Philip conscious of his own abilities and at the same time convinced of the extreme weakness of those who commanded the allied army determined to bring on a general engagement as soon as possible and with this view advanced into the plain of Chaeronea a place rendered famous by the event of this important contest His army amounted to about thirtytwo thousand men that of the consederates did not exceed thirty thousand  On the eve of the day on which this decisive battle was fought Diogenes the cynic who had long looked with equal contempt on either party was led by curiosity to visit the camps as an unconcerned spectator In the Macedonian camp where his person and character were not known he was stopped by the guards and conducted to Philip's tent The king asked him sternly whether he came as a spy  "Yes said Diogenes I am  come to spy upon your folly and ambition in thus setting your life and kingdom to the hazard of an hour"  And now the fatal morning appeared which was for ever to decide the cause of liberty and the empire of Greece Before the rising of the sun both armies were ranged in order of battle The Thebans with the sacred band in front occupied the right wing of the confederate Greeks the Athenians commanded by Lysicles and Chares formed the left and the Corinthians and Peloponnesians were posted in the centre On the left of the Macedonian army stood Alexander at the head of a chosen body of noble Macedonians supported by the famous cavalry of Thessaly In the centre were placed those Greeks who had united with Philip and on whose courage he could least depend while the king himself commanded on the right where his renowned phalanx stood to oppose the mpetuosity with which the Athenians were well known to begin their onset  The charge began on each side with all the courage and violence which ambition revenge the love of glory and the love of liberty could excite in the several combatants Alexander at the head of the Macedonian nobles first fell with all the fury of youthful courage on the sacred band of Thebes which sustained the attack with a bravery and vigour worthy of its former fame The gallant youths who composed this body not being timely or duly supported by their countrymen bore up for a while against the torrent of the enemy till at length oppressed and overpowered by superior numbers without yielding or turning their backs on their assailants they sunk down on that ground where they had been originally stationed each by the side of his darling friend raising up a bulwark by their bodies against the progress of the enemy  But the young prince and his forces in all the enthusiastic ardour of valour animated by success pushed on through all the carnage and over all the heaps of slain and fell furiously on the main body of the Thebans where they were opposed with obstinate and deliberate courage and the contest was for some time supported with equal resolution on both sides  In the mean time the Athenians on the left wing fought with a spirit and intrepidity worthy of the character which they boasted and of the cause by which they were animated Many gallant efforts were made by either party and success was for some time doubtful till at length part of the centre and the right wing of the Macedonians except the phalanx yielded to the impetuous attack of the Athenians and fled with some precipitation Happy had it been that day for Greece if the conduct and abilities of the Grecian generals had been equal to the valour of their soldiers But those brave champions of liberty were led on by the despicable creatures of intrigue and cabal Transported by the advantage now obtained the presumptuous Lysicles cried out  "Come on my gallant countrymen the victory is ours let us pursue these cowards and drive them back to Macedon"  and thus instead of improving the happy opportunity by charging the phalanx in flank and so breaking this formidable body the Athenians wildly and precipitately pressed forward in pursuit of the flying enemy themselves in all the tumult and disorder of a rout  Philip saw this fatal error with all the contempt of a skilful general and the secret exultation arising from the assurance of approaching victory He coolly observed to those officers that stood round him that the Athenians knew not how to conquer and ordered his phalanx to change its position and by  a sudden evolution to gain possession of an adjacent eminence From thence they marched deliberately down firm and collected and fell with their united force on the Athenians now confident of success and blind to their danger The shock was irresistible they were at once overwhelmed many of them lay crushed by the weight of the enemy and expiring of their wounds while the rest escaped from the dreadful slaughter by a shameful and precipitate flight bearing down and hurrying along with them those troops which had been stationed for their support And here it was that the great orator and statesman who had excited his countrymen to make this glorious struggle in defence of their liberty tarnished all the honours he had acquired in the senate by his pusillanimity in the field He took to flight the very first onset and throwing away his shield on which were inscribed these words To Good Fortune he appeared among the foremost in the general rout The ridicule and malice of his enemies related or perhaps invented another shameful circumstance that being impeded in his flight by some brambles his imagination was so possessed by the presence of the enemy that he loudly cried out for quarter  While Philip was thus triumphant on his side Alexander continued the conflict on the other wing and at length broke the Thebans in spite of all their acts of valour who now fled from the field and were pursued with great carnage The center of the confederates was thus totally abandoned to the fury of a victorious enemy But enough of slaughter had already been made more than one thousand of the Athenians lay dead on the field of battle two thousand were made prisoners and the loss of the Thebans was not inferior Philip therefore determined to conclude his important  victory by an act of apparent clemency which his policy and ambition really dictated He gave orders that the Greeks should be spared carefully locking up in his own breast the design he had formed against their liberties and hoping one day to march at their head to accomplish the conquest of the Persian monarchy  Philip's behaviour upon obtaining this victory is differently represented by different historians Some say that he expressed his joy in so extravagant and even ludicrous a manner as to extort from Demades one of the Athenian prisoners the following severe reprimand"Fortune" said that orator to him  "has given you the part of Agamemnon but you are acting that of Thersites"  Justin however represents his conduct in a more amiable and engaging light He says that he was at great pains to dissemble his joy that he affected extreme modesty and the utmost compassion for the prisoners that he was not even seen to laugh that he would have no sacrifice no crowns no perfumes that he forbade all kinds of sports and did nothing that might make him appear to the conquerors to be elated nor to the conquered to be insolent Certain it is that he immediately concluded a peace with the Athenians and though he treated the Thebans as unfaithful allies with greater severity yet after compelling them to pay a ransom for their prisoners and a large sum of money for leave to bury their dead and after placing a garrison in their citadel he agreed to make a peace with them also  It is said that Isocrates the celebrated rhetorician was so deeply affected when he heard of the loss of the battle of Chaeronea that unable to survive the disgrace which that event had brought upon his country he hastened his end by abstaining from  all kind of food he was then in the ninetyeighth year of his age  Lysicles who had the chief command of the Athenians in this engagement and by whose misconduct the battle had been lost was soon after summoned before an assembly of the people and was condemned to die at the instance of Lycurgus who had great credit and influence in the city but was a severe judge and a most bitter accuser  "You Lysicles" said he "were general of the army a thousand citizens were slain two thousand taken prisoners a trophy has been erected to the dishonour of this city and all Greece is enslaved You had the command when all these things happened and yet you dare to live and view the light of the sun and blush not to appear publicly in the Forum you Lysicles who are born the monument of your country's shame"  This Lycurgus who did not disgrace the name which he bore was one of the first orators of the age and was still more remarkable for the integrity of his life than the force of his eloquence For after having managed the public treasure for the space of twelve years he caused an exact register of every thing he had done during his whole administration to be fixed up on a pillar that every body might see it and censure it if they pleased Nay he carried this point so far that in his last illness he ordered himself to be carried to the senatehouse to give a public account of all his actions and after having refuted one who accused him there he went home and died Though naturally grave and even austere in his temper he was a great encourager of the stage and as a proof of his regard for dramatic writers he erected the statues of Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides  Chares who was probably as guilty as Lysicles appears to have escaped merely through the insignificance  of his character Indeed his abilities were so contemptible that according to Timotheus  "he was much fitter to carry the general's baggage than to be a general himself"  Many people thought that Demosthenes might on account of his speeches be considered as the real cause of the terrible blow which Athens had now sustained and that upon him therefore would certainly fall the principal weight of the natural resentment But in this they were disappointed The Athenians were so fully conviced of his integrity and patriotism that at the very moment they were smarting under the wound they had just received they submitted entirely to his counsels and direction Indeed he appears to have been highly deserving of all the confidence they reposed in him For being appointed at this time to supply the city with provisions and to repair the walls he executed the latter commission with so much generosity that as the public treasure was unequal to the expence he made up the deficiency out of his own private fortune  It was for this instance of public spirit that his friend Ctesiphon proposed in an assembly of the people that a crown of gold should be bestowed upon him and this gave rise to the celebrated contest between Aeschines and Demosthenes one of the most remarkable that is to be found in history Aeschines the declared rival of Demosthenes not only in eloquence but in politics brought an accusation against Ctesiphon for the proposal he had made in favour of his friend who naturally defended the equity of the measure in which he thought his own honour so essentially concerned  No cause ever excited so much curiosity or was pleaded with so much ability People flocked to it from all parts and they had good reason for so doing for what sight could be nobler than a conflict  between two orators each of them excellent in his way both formed by nature improved by art and animated by perpetual dissensions and an implacable animosity against each other The juncture seemed to favour Aeschines very much for the Macedonian party whom he always befriended was very powerful in Athens especially since the ruin of Thebes Nevertheless he lost his cause and was justly sentenced to banishment for his rash accusation He thereupon went and settled himself at Rhodes where he opened a school of eloquence the fame and glory of which continued for many ages He began his lectures with the two orations that had occasioned his banishment Great encomiums were passed upon that of Aeschines but when he repeated the speech of Demosthenes the plaudits and acclamations were redoubled And it was then he uttered these words so highly praiseworthy in the mouth of a rival  "Alas what unbounded applauses would you have bestowed on this speech had you heard Demosthenes deliver it himself"  Demosthenes thus become victor made a good use of his conquest For the instant Aeschines left Athens in order to embark for Rhodes Demosthenes ran after him and forced him to accept of a purse of money On this occasion Aeschines cried out  "How will it be possible for me not to regret a country in which I leave an enemy more generous than I can hope to find friends in any other part of the world"  In the mean time Philip had his ambition pleased but not satisfied with his last victory The sovereignty of Greece even if he had acquired it he always considered but as a secondary object and only as the means of preparing his way for the conquest of Persia which he had long planned in his mind and hoped to be able one day to accomplish  But this he knew he could not do without the assistance of the Greeks which however he thought he could the more easily procure for such an undertaking as they had long burned with an ardent desire of revenging upon Persia the injuries they had received from it and of working the total distruction of that empire Philip therefore now proposing to lead them to such a glorious gratification of their revenge they readily chose him generalissimo of their forces and he accordingly began to make preparations for invading the dominions of the Persian monarch  But while Philip was thus successful in his public undertakings the violent dissensions that reigned in his family destroyed all his private peace and at last brought him to an untimely end He had married Olympias the daughter of the king of Epirus and the early part of their union was crowned with happiness but as she was naturally of a peevish and vindictive disposition a coldness first and afterwards a rooted aversion took place between them This was probably hastened by the passion which Philip had conceived for Cleopatra niece to Attalus one of his principal officers In a word his love to this lady and his aversion to Olympias grew at last so strong that he resolved to espouse the former after having divorced the latter In vain did Alexander his son remonstrate that by divorcing Olympias and engaging in a second marriage he exposed him to the danger of contending with a number of competitors for the crown and rendered his succession precarious  "My son said the king if I create you a number of competitors you will have the glorious opportunity of exerting yourself to surpass them all in merit thus shall their rivalship only render you more worthy of the throne"  His marriage with Cleopatra was now declared in form and celebrated with all the pomp and magnificence which the occasion required The young prince however dissatisfied was yet obliged to attend on these solemnities and sat in silent indignation at that feast which proclaimed the disgrace of his mother In such circumstances his youthful and impetuous mind could not fail to take fire at any the least shadow of insult Attalus uncle to the new queen was so unguarded as in the midst of the entertainment to call aloud upon the Macedonian nobles to pour out their libations to the gods that they might grant the king the happy fruits of the present nuptials and legitimate heirs to his throne  "Wretch cried Alexander with his eyes sparkling with that indignation which he had till now suppressed dost thou then call me bastard"  And instantly darted his goblet at Attalus who returned the outrage with double violence Clamour and confusion arose and the king in a sudden fit of rage snatched his sword and flew directly towards his son His precipitation his lameness for he had been wounded in the battle with the Triballi and the quantity of wine in which he had indulged happily disappointed his rash purpose he stumbled and fell on the floor while Alexander with an unpardonable insolence cried out  "Behold ye Macedonians this is the king who is preparing to lead you into Asia see where in passing from one table to another he is fallen to the ground"  Philip however did not lose sight of the conquest of Asia Full of the mighty project he consulted the gods to know what would be the event of it and the priestess replied  "The victim is already crowned his end draws nigh and he will soon be sacrificed"  Philip interpreted this oracle in his own favour though the ambiguity of it might have made him suspect its meaning and that it was  as applicable to some other event as to the conquest of Asia The fact is it soon after appeared that it was more applicable to himself than to the Persian monarch For while he was celebrating the nuptials of his daughter Cleopatra with Alexander king of Epirus and brother to his queen Olympias he was suddenly stabbed in the height of the solemnity and in the midst of his guards by one Pausanias a noble Macedonian whom Attalus his favourite general had cruelly abused and who having repeatedly demanded reparation of the king in vain at last turned the edge of his resentment from the author of his wrong to his sovereign himself and took this dreadful method of satiating his revenge  Olympias is supposed to have instigated Pausanias to this desperate act Certain it is that when his dead body for he was instantly dispatched by the guards was hung up on a gibbet it appeared next morning crowned with a golden diadem a mark of respect which no one could have ventured to shew to it but Olympias In a few days after she took a further occasion of publishing her triumph and exultation in her husband's fall by paying the same funeral honours to Pausanias that were paid to Philip both bodies were burned on the same pile and the ashes of both deposited in the same tomb She is even said to have prevailed on the Macedonians to pay annual honours to Pausanias as if she feared that the share which he had in the death of Philip should not be known to the whole world She consecrated to Apollo the dagger which had been the instrument of the fatal deed inscribed with the name of Myrtalis the name which she bore when their loves first began  Thus died Philip a prince possessed of great abilities both in peace and war but much fonder of gaining his ends by dexterity and address than by  of arms The news of his death was a joyful surprise in Greece and particularly at Athens where the people crowned themselves with garlands and decreed a crown to Pausanias They sacrificed to the gods for their deliverance and sung songs of triumph as if Philip had been slain by them in battle But this excess of joy very ill became them because it was altogether inconsistent with their late behaviour to that prince for when he was chosen generalissimo of the Greeks and still more when he celebrated the nuptials of his daughter the Athenians were the most forward and the most fulsome in their compliments to him and carried their adulation so far as almost to exalt him to the rank of a God  CHAP XIII FROM THE BIRTH OF ALEXANDER TO HIS SETTING OUT FOR ASIA  ALEXANDER the son of Philip ascended the throne upon the death of his father and took possession of a kingdom rendered flourishing and powerful by the policy of the preceding reign  He came into the world the very day the celebrated temple of Diana at Ephesus was burnt which gave occasion to Hegesias the historian to say  "that it was no wonder the temple was burnt as Diana was that day employed at the delivery of Olympias to facilitate the birth of Alexander"  The passion by which Alexander was most powerfully actuated even in his tender years was ambition and a love of glory but not of every kind of glory Philip like a sophist valued himself upon his eloquence and the beauty of his style and had the vanity to have engraved on his coins the  several victories he had won in the chariotrace at the Olympic games But it was not after such empty honours that his son aspired When his friends one day asked him whether he would contend at these games  "Yes said he I readily will provided I may have kings to contend with me"  Every time news was brought him that his father had taken some city or gained some great battle Alexander so far from sharing in the general joy used to say in a plaintive tone of voice to the young persons that were brought up with him  "Friends my father will possess himself of every thing and leave nothing for me to do"  Some ambassadors from the king of Persia having one day arrived at court in his father's absence and Alexander being obliged to entertain them he not only charmed them with the politeness of his behaviour but he filled them with astonishment at his common good sense and the sagacity of his remarks For instead of asking them questions about such trifling circumstances as are commonly the objects of curiosity to people of his years such as the so much boasted gardens suspended in the air the riches and magnificence of the palace and court of the king of Persia which excited the admiration of the whole world the famous golden plantaintree and that golden vine the grapes of which were emeralds carbuncles rubies and all sorts of precious stones under which the Persian monarch was said frequently to give audienceinstead I say of asking such frivolous questions as these Alexander enquired which was the road to Upper Asia what was the distance of the several places in what the real strength of the king of Persia consisted in what part of the battle he fought how he behaved towards his enemies and in what manner he governed his subjects The ambassadors surprised to see him discover a sagacity so greatly beyond  his years could not help exclaiming  "This young prince is great and ours is rich that man must be extremely insignificant who has no other merit than his riches"  So ripe a judgment in this young prince was as much owing to the good education which had been given him as to the strength of his natural parts Several preceptors as we have already observed were employed to teach him music and other superficial accomplishments but the tutor from whom he received all his real and useful knowledge was Aristotle the most famous and most learned philosopher of the age it was he that was entrusted with the chief care of Alexander's education One of the reasons which prompted Philip to give him a master of so much eminence and merit was as he himself tells us that his son might avoid committing a great many faults of which he himself had been guilty  Philip was sufficiently sensible of Aristotle's merit and he rewarded it with the liberality and munificence of a prince He not only settled a genteel salary upon him but he afterwards expressed his regard for him in a more public and conspicuous manner for having formerly stormed and sacked Stagira the native city of Aristotle he now rebuilt it and reinstated the inhabitants who had fled from it or were made slaves giving them besides a fine park in the neighbourhood as a place for their studies and exercises Plutarch tells us that even in his time the people of Stagira shewed the stoneseats of Aristotle as also the shady walks which he used to frequent  Alexander likewise discovered no less esteem for his master whom he believed himself bound to love as much as if he had been his father declaring that he was indebted to the one for living and to the other for living well The progress of the  pupil was equal to the care and abilities of the preceptor He grew extremely fond of philosophy and learned the several parts of it But his favourite study was morality which is properly the science of kings because it is the knowledge of mankind and of their duties To this he applied himself with unwearied attention and considered it even at that time as the foundation of prudence and wise policy  Nor was Aristotle less careful to instruct him in the art of speaking than in that of thinking and reasoning and for this purpose he wrote his celebrated treatise on rhetoric in the beginning of which he proves the vast advantages a prince may derive from eloquence as it gives him the greatest ascendant over the minds of men which he ought to acquire as well by his wisdom as authority Some answers and letters of Alexander which are still extant shew that he possessed in its greatest perfection that strong that manly eloquence which abounds with sense and ideas and which is so entirely free from superfluous expressions that every single word has its meaning which properly speaking is the eloquence of kings  His esteem or rather his veneration for Homer is well known When a golden box enriched with precious stones was found in the Persian camp after the battle of Arbela and it was deliberated to what purpose it should be applied Alexander said that there was nothing so worthy of being put into it as Homer's Poems which he believed to be the most perfect and most complete production of the human mind He admired particularly the Iliad which he considered as a treasure of military knowledge He always had with him that copy of it which had been revised and corrected by Aristotle and to which he gave the name of the casketcopy and he laid it with his sword every night under his pillow  Fond even to excess of every kind of glory he was displeased with Aristotle his master for having published in his absence certain metaphysical pieces which he himself desired to possess exclusively of all others and even at the time when he was employed in the conquest of Asia and the pursuit of Darius he wrote him a letter which is still extant wherein he complains upon that very account Alexander says in it that he had much rather surpass others in the knowledge of the sublimer sciences than in the greatness of his power or the extent of his dominion  He had also a taste for the whole circle of the arts but in such a manner as became a prince that is he knew the value and utility of them Music painting sculpture architecture flourished in his reign because they found him both a judge and a generous protector who was able to distinguish and to reward merit But he despised certain trifling feats of dexterity that were of no use One day some Macedonians expressing their surprise at the ingenuity of a man that excelled in throwing small peas through the eye of a needle Alexander said that he would make him a present suitable to his employment and he accordingly sent him a basket of peas  The first instance Alexander gave of his bold and daring spirit was in his management of the famous horse Bucephalus which had been brought to his father's court by Philonicus the Thessalian who refused to sell him for less than thirteen talents The king went into the plains attended by his courtiers in order to make a trial of this horse but they found him so very wild and unmanageable that no one would venture to mount him Philip being angry that so furious and ungovernable a creature had been brought to him gave orders for their carrying him back again Alexander who was  present at this time cried out  "What a noble horse we are going to lose for want of address and boldness to back him"  Philip at first considered these words as the effect of folly and rashness so common to young men but as Alexander still insisted upon what he had said and was very uneasy to see so noble a creature just going to be sent home again his father at last gave him leave to try what he could do The young prince overjoyed at this permission goes up to Bucephalus takes hold of the bridle and turns his head to the sun having observed that the thing which frightened him was his own shadow Alexander therefore first stroked him gently with his hand and soothed him with his voice then seeing his fierceness abate he softly let fall his cloak and springing upon his back at one leap he first slightly tightened the rein without striking or vexing him and when he perceived that his fire was cooled that he was no longer so furious and violent and that he wanted only to move forward he gave him the rein and spurring him with great vigour animated him with his voice to his full speed While this was doing Philip and his whole court trembled for fear and did not once open their lips but when the prince after having run his first heat returned with pride and triumph at having thus broke a horse that was deemed absolutely ungovernable the courtiers in general burst out into acclamations of applause while Philip with tears of joy in his eyes embraced Alexander as he alighted and said  "My son seek a kingdom more worthy of thee for Macedon is below thy merit"  Alexander upon his accession to the throne saw himself surrounded with danger on every side not only from the barbarous nations with whom Philip had contended during his whole reign and who were impatient of the yoke he had imposed upon  them but likewise from the Greeks themselves who resolved to lay hold of this opportunity to recover their liberties of which Philip had deprived them in reality though not in appearance The danger indeed from both these quarters was so great and so imminent that the more prudent among the Macedonians advised their sovereign to ward them off by policy and address rather than repel them by force of arms But these timorous counsels were by no means agreeable to the bold and enterprising spirit of Alexander He plainly saw that if his enemies perceived him betraying the least symptom of fear they would be all upon him at once would strip him of his father's conquests and reduce his dominions to the narrow limits of Macedon  He therefore marched first against the Barbarians and crossing the Danube in one night he defeated the king of the Triballi in a great battle and struck such terror into the neighbouring nations as obliged them for the present to remain quiet Returning thence in a little time he turned his arms against the Greeks and particularly the Thebans who upon a false report of his death had cut to pieces a great number of the Macedonian garrison in thei  citadel To this they were chiefly instigated by th  harangues of Demosthenes who is likewise said to have invented the report of Alexander's death and in so doing seems not to have acted with his usua  prudence for the falsity of this report could no  be long concealed and when it was discovered i  must not only have defeated the end it was in tended to serve but must have rendered the veracit  of the reporter for ever after suspicious Alexande  however soon convinced them that he was neithe  dead nor even indisposed for his arrival in Greec  was so sudden and so unexpected that the The+ban  cou  d scarce believe their own eyes when the  Being come before their walls he wa  willing to allow them time to repent and only demanded to have Phoenix and Prothules the two chief ringleaders of the revolt delivered up to him and published by sound of trumpet a general pardon to all who should come over to him But the Thebans by way of insult demanded to have Philotas and Antipater delivered to them and invited by proclamation all who were solicitous for the liberty of Greece to join them in its defence  Alexander finding it impossible to prevail upon them by gentle means was obliged to employ more powerful arguments and to decide the matter by force of arms A great battle was accordingly fought in which the Thebans behaved with a spirit and intrepidity much beyond their strength for the enemy exceeded them vastly in numbers But after a long and obstinate dispute the Macedonian garrison coming down from the citadel and attacking them in the rear the Thebans were surrounded on all sides the greatest part of them were cut in pieces and the city was taken and plundered  The calamities which they suffered on this occasion may be more easily conceived than expressed Some Thracians having pulled down the house of a virtuous lady of quality Timoclea by name carried off all her goods and treasures and their captain naming forcibly violated her chastity enquired of her afterwards whether she had not concealed gold and silver Timoclea animated by an ardent desire of revenge said that she had hid some and taking him with her alone into the garden and shewing him a well told him that there lay her concealed treasure The Barbarian stooping down to look into the well Timoclea who was behind him pushed him forward with all her might threw him in and afterwards killed him with great stones which she heaped upon him She was instantly seized by the Thracians and being put in chains  was carried before Alexander The prince immediately perceived by her mien that she was a woman of quality and of a lofty spirit for she followed those brutal wretches with an undaunted air and without discovering the least sign of fear Alexander asking her who she was Timoclea replied  "I am sister to Theagenes who fought against Philip for the liberty of Greece and was killed in the battle of Chaeronea where he commanded"  The prince admiring her magnanimous answer and the punishment she had inflicted on her cruel ravisher gave orders that she should have leave to retire wherever she pleased with her children  Alexander considered for some time with himself how he should act with regard to Thebes His own resentment carried him to the most violent measures and this was still farther inflamed by the representations of the Phocians and the people of Plataea Thespiae and Orchomenus who were all of them mortal enemies to the Thebans Transported therefore by his own furious passions and still further instigated by their cruel advice he unhappily adopted the most severe resolution and the city was instantly razed to the ground But he did not wreak his vengeance upon all the inhabitants indiscriminately He set the priests at liberty as also all such as had a right of hospitality with the Macedonians the descendants of Pindar the famous poet who had done so much honour to Greece and such likewise as bad opposed the revolt But all the rest in number about thirty thousand he sold and upwards of six thousand had been killed in battle The Athenians were so deeply affected on hearing of the sad catastrophe of Thebes that they put off the celebration of the Great Mysteries which they were about to solemnize and they received with the greatest humanity all those who had escaped  from the battle and the sacking of Thebes and made Athens their asylum  The Athenians had not only encouraged the Thebans to set Alexander at defiance they had even formed a league with them and the Lacedaemonians to check the progress of his arms but his sudden arrival in Greece and the example he had now given of the dreadful consequences of incurring his displeasure made them begin to abate considerably of their wonted pride and instead of presuming to oppose his power they judged it for the present the most eligible course to implore his clemency They therefore sent a deputation to him in which Demosthenes was included but he had no sooner arrived at mount Cytheron than dreading the anger of the Macedonian prince he quitted the embassy and returned home  Alexander well knew that it was the orators chiefly that kept alive the love of liberty and the spirit of independence among the people of Athens and consequently formed the greatest obstacle to the completion of his designs He therefore now demanded that ten of these orators should be put into his hands It was on this occasion that Demosthenes related to the people the fable of the wolves and the dogs in which it is supposed that the wolves one day told the sheep that in case they desired to be at peace with them they must deliver up to them the dogs who were their guard The application was easy and natural especially with respect to the orators who were justly compared to dogs whose duty it is to watch to bark and to fight in order to save the lives of the flock  In this afflicting dilemma of the Athenians who could not think of delivering up their orators to what they considered as certain death though they had no other way to save their city Demades whom Alexander had honoured with his friendship  offered to undertake the embassy alone and intercede for them He did so and succeeded whether it was that the king had already satiated his revenge and that he was willing by some act of clemency to wipe out the remembrance of the cruelties he had lately committed or perhaps was desirous of conciliating the affections of the Greeks in general before he set out on his Asiatic expedition Certain it is that he waved his demand with regard to the delivery of the Athenian orators and was pacified by their sending into banishment Caridemus who being a native of Oraea had been presented by the Athenians with the freedom of the city  As for the Athenians themselves he not only forgave them the several injuries he pretended to have received from them but he even flattered their pride by advising them to give particular attention to public affairs because in case of his death he said they were likely to give law to the rest of Greece Historians relate that many years after this expedition he was seized with remorse for the cruel punishment he had inflicted on the Thebans and that this softened his temper and made him behave with greater humanity towards other nations  Being now freed from all apprehensions of any further opposition from Greece he summoned at Corinth an assembly of the several states and free cities of that country in order to obtain from them the supreme command against the Persians which had been granted to his father a little before his death No assembly ever deliberated upon a more important subject It was the western world deciding upon the fate of the east and concerting methods for executing a revenge which had been suspended for more than an age The assembly held at this time gave rise to events the relation of which appears astonishing and almost incredible and to  revolutions which contributed to change the disposition of most things in the political world  To accomplish such a scheme required a prince of Alexander's bold and enterprising spirit and a people like the Greeks brave hardy and active animated by a love of military glory and inspired with an implacable resentment against the nation they were going to attack The Greeks indeed had long wished for an opportunity to revenge upon Persia the injuries they had sustained from that empire and they now therefore accepted with pleasure the offer of Alexander to lead them against their old and irreconcileable enemies whose destruction they had repeatedly sworn and whom they hoped in a little time to be able to extirpate The Lacedaemonians were the only people that made any objections to this proposal They said  "they had always been accustomed to point out the way to glorious deeds and not to be directed by others"  But they were obliged to submit to the prevailing sense of the assembly and Alexander was of course appointed generalissimo against the Persians  He was no sooner raised to this high rank than he received congratulations from the philosophers the governors of cities and other great men and he expected the same compliment from Diogenes of Synope who was then at Corinth But as Diogenes did not think proper to come to him he went attended by his whole court to visit that philosopher He found him lying on the ground and basking himself in the sun and being surprised to see a man of so much reputation living in such extreme poverty he naturally asked him whether he wanted any thing  "Only said Diogenes that you would stand from between me and the sun"  This answer excited the contempt of all the courtiers but the king was so struck with the philosopher's greatness  of soul that he could not help exclaiming  "Were I not Alexander I would be Diogenes"  Before he set out for Asia he resolved to consult the oracle of Apollo He therefore went to Delphos where he happened to arrive in those days which are called unlucky that is at a time when it was unlawful to give responses and accordingly the priestess refused to go to the temple But Alexander who could not bear any contradiction to his will took her forcibly by the arm and as he was leading her to the temple she cried out  "My son thou art invincible"  Alexander catching hold of these words as the answer of the oracle declared that it was needless to consult the God any further and he therefore returned to Macedon in order to prepare for his great expedition  Some of his friends advised him before he embarked in this undertaking to make choice of a consort in order to secure himself a successor to his throne But the king who was of an impetuous temper disapproved of this advice and said that after he had been nominated generalissimo of the Greeks and that his father had left him so gallant an army it would be a shame for him to lose time in celebrating his marriage and waiting for the fruits of it and that therefore he was determined to set out immediately  Before he did so however he thought proper to settle the affairs of Macedon He appointed Antipater to be viceroy of that kingdom with an army of twelve thousand shot and near the same number of horse He then enquired into the private circumstances of his friends giving to one an estate in land to another a village to a third the revenues of a town and to a fourth the toll of an harbour As all the revenues of his crown were already employed or exhausted by his donations Perdiccas said to him  "My Lord what is it you  reserve for yourself"  Alexander replied  Hope  upon which Perdiccas said  "the same hope ought therefore to satisfy us"  and so refused very generously to accept of what the king had allotted him  CHAP XIV FROM ALEXANDER'S ARRIVAL IN ASIA TO HIS DEATH  ALEXANDER having taken the necessary precautions for securing the tranquillity of Macedon in his absence set out for Asia in the beginning of the spring His army consisted of little more than thirty thousand foot and four or five thousand horse but then they were all brave men well disciplined and enured to fatigue They had made several campaigns under Philip and were each of them in case of necessity capable of commanding most of the officers were near threescore years of age and the common men fifty and when they were either assembled or drawn up at the h  d of a camp they had the appearance of a venerable senate Parmenio commanded the infantry P  lotas his son had eighteen hundred horse under him and Callas the son of Harpalus the same na  ger of Thessalian cavalry The rest of the horse consisting of natives of the several states were under the direction of a separate commander And the Thracians and Poeonians who were always in front were headed by Cassandra Such was the army which was to decide the fortune not only of Greece but of all the eastern world Alexander began his march along the lake Cercinum and after passing the rivers Strymon and Hebrus he came to the shore of the Hellespont which he crossed in an hundred and sixty gallies and several flatbottomed  vessels himself steering his own galley and upon his arrival at the opposite coast as if to take possession of the continent he leaped from his ship in complete armour and expressed the greatest transports of joy  It has frequently been thought strange that the Persians took no step to check the progress of the Macedonians at the Hellespont where they might certainly have been opposed with the greatest ease especially as the former were possessed of a large and powerful fleet and that of the latter was very inconsiderable Whether this proceeded from supineness and inattention or from a contempt of the enemy it is difficult to determine Whatever was the cause the event proved equally fatal to the Persians  Alexander being arrived at Lampsacus was going to destroy it in order to punish the rebellion of the inhabitants and Anaximenes therefore a native of the place came to him with a view of diverting him from his cruel resolution This man who was a famous historian had been very intimate with Philip his father and Alexander himself had a great esteem for him having been his pupil The king suspecting the purport of his errand and willing to be beforehand with him swore that he would never grant his request  "The favour I have to desire of you says Anaximenes is that you would destroy Lampsacus"  By this witty evasion the historian saved his country  From thence Alexander went to Troy where he paid great honours to the memory of the heroes who had fallen there and particularly to that of Achilles at whose tomb he caused funeral games to be performed He declared that he looked upon Achilles as one of the happiest of men in having had during his life so faithful a friend as a Patroclus  and after his death so famous a poet as Homer to celebrate his actions  When Darius was informed of Alexander's arrival in Asia he expressed the utmost contempt for the Macedonian army and indignation at the presumption of their general He wrote letters to the governors of his different provinces commanding them if they took Alexander alive to whip him with rods to make prisoners of his whole army and to send them as slaves to one of the remotest and most desert parts of his dominions It was not long however before he had reason to entertain more just and more modest sentiments Alexander being arrived on the banks of the Granicus a river of Phrygia found the Persians to the number of a hundred and ten thousand men drawn up on the other side and ready to dispute his passage Memnon who command all the seacoast of Asia under Darius gave it as his opinion that the wisest course would be to lay waste the adjacent country and thus to oblige the Macedonian army either to retreat or to surrender at discretion for want of provisions But this prudent advice was overruled by Arsites a Phrygian Satrap who said that he would never suffer the Grecians to make such havock in the territories he governed  Nor was Alexander on his side without those who advised him to proceed with caution and to refrain from crossing the river the same day on which he reached it This in particular was the opinion of Parmenio a brave and experienced officer who observed that the troops were already too much fatigued with their march to be equal to the additional labour of crossing a river especially one which was so deep and whose banks were so craggy and that too in the face of such an immense body of the enemy who were perfectly fresh and were ready to oppose him But these arguments made no impression  on Alexander who declared that it would be a shame for him after crossing the Hellespont to suffer his progress to be interrupted by a rivulet for so he called the Granicus by way of contempt that on the contrary they ought to take advantage of the terror which the suddenness of his arrival and the boldness of his attempt had spread among the Persians and answer the high opinion the world had conceived of his courage and the valour of the Macedonians  The two armies however continued for some time on the opposite banks of the river the one looking out for a proper place to ford it and the other narrowly watching their motions and determined if possible to prevent their passage At last Alexander ordered his horse to be brought and commanding the nobleman of his court to follow him and behave gallantly he caused a strong detachment to march into the river himself following it with the right wing of his army as Parmenio did with the  t The Persians seeing the detachment advance began to let fly their arrows and march to a place where the bank was not so steep in order to keep the Macedonians from landing But now the horse engaged with great fury one part endeavouring to land and the other striving to prevent them The Macedonians whose cavalry were vastly inferior in number besides the disadvantage of the ground were overwhelmed with the showers of darts that were poured from the eminence not to mention that the flower of the Persian horse were drawn together here and were headed by Memnon the ablest and most resolute of all the Persian generals The Macedonians therefore at last gave way after having performed many signal acts of valour But Alexander coming up restored the battle he reinforced them with his best troops he headed them himself he animated them by his presence  he pushed the Persians and at last routed them upon which the whole army followed after crossed the river and attacked the enemy on all sides  Alexander first charged the thickest part of the enemy's horse in which the generals fought He himself was particularly conspicuous by his shield and the plume of feathers that overshadowed his helmet so that he was easily distinguished from the rest of the army The charge therefore was very furious about his person and though only the horse engaged they fought like foot man to man without giving way on either side Spithridates lieutenantgovernor of Ionia and soninlaw to Darius distinguished himself above the rest of the generals by his superior bravery Surrounded by forty Persian lords all of them his relations of experienced valour and who never moved from his side he carried terror wherever he came Alexander observing in how gallant a manner he signalized himself clapt spurs to his horse and advanced towards him Immediately they engaged and each having thrown a javelin wounded the other slightly Spithridates falls furiously sword in hand upon Alexander who being prepared for him thrusts his p  ke into his face and laid him dead at his feet At that very moment Rhaesaces brother to that nobleman charging him on the side gave him a furious blow on the head with his battleaxe which beat off his plume but went no deeper than his hair As he was going to repeat the blow on his head which now appeared through the broken helmet Clytus cut off Rhaesaces's hand with one stroke of his scimitar and by that means saved his sovereign's life The danger to which Alexander had exposed himself added fresh courage to his soldiers who now performed prodigies of valour The Persians therefore unable any longer to sustain the assault of  the Macedonians immediately gave way and were put to a total rout Alexander did not pursue them far but wheeling about suddenly began in an instant to make an attack upon the foot  The contest here was neither long nor violent for the enemy seeing the Macedonian phalanx which had now crossed the river and was regularly formed advancing against them they immediately took to flight all but the Grecian infantry in Darius's pay This body of foot retiring to a hill demanded permission to march away unmolested but Alexander guided by passion rather than reason rushed furiously into the midst of them and had his horse killed under him by the thrust of a sword The battle here for some time was so hot that more of the Macedonians tell in this encounter than in all the preceding action for they fought against a body of men who were well disciplined had been enured to war and were actuated by despair They were all cut to pieces two thousand excepted who were taken prisoners  A great number of the Persian commanders lay dead on the spot Arsites fled into Phrygia where he is said to have laid violent hands on himself for having advised his countrymen to come to an immediate engagement In this action twenty thousand foot and two thousand five hundred horse were killed on the side of the barbarians and of the Macedonians twentyfive of the royal horse were killed in the first attack Alexander ordered Lysippus to make their statues of brass all of which were set up in a city of Macedon called Dia from whence they were many years after carried to Rome by Metelius About threescore of the other horse were killed and near thirty foot who the next day were all laid with their arms and equipage in one grave and the king granted an exemption to their  fathers and children from every kind of tribute and service  He also took the utmost care of the wounded visited them and saw their wounds dressed He enquired very particularly into their adventures and permitted every one of them to relate his actions in the battle and boast of his bravery He also granted the rites of sepulture to the principal Persians and did not even refuse it to such Greeks as died in the Persian service but all those whom he took prisoners he put in chains and sent to work as slaves in Macedonia for having fought under the barbarian standard against their country contrary to the express prohibition made by Greece on that head  Alexander thought it his duty and made it his pleasure to share the honour of his victory with the Greeks He sent to the Athenians three hundred shields being part of the plunder taken from the enemy and caused this glorious inscription to be put upon the rest of the spoils  "Alexander son of Philip with the Greeks the Lacedaemonians excepted gained these spoils from the barbarians who inhabit Asia"  The greatest part of the gold and silver plate the purple carpets and other articles of Persian luxury he sent to his mother  The terrible defeat which the Persians had now sustained struck such a terror into their minds that they could not be brought for a long time to oppose Alexander in the field and he therefore proceeded without interruption to make himself master of one town after another some indeed with more and others with less difficulty Sardis and Ephesus he easily reduced The inhabitants of the former he took under his protection and permitted them to be governed by their own laws observing to his friends at the same time that such as lay the foundation of a new empire should always endeavour to have the fame of being merciful  At Ephesus he assigned to the temple of Diana the tributes which had been paid to the Persian kings  He next laid siege to Miletus and afterwards to Halicarnassus both of which he compelled to surrender though not till after a sharp and obstinate resistance as both of them were defended by Memnon the bravest and most experienced of all Darius's generals The Milesians he treated with great humanity but Halicarnassus he thought proper to raze to the ground Soon after this he restored Ada queen of Caria to her kingdom of which she had been lately dispossessed and she in order to testify her gratitude sent him meats dressed in the most exquisite manner and the most excellent cooks of every kind Alexander thanked her for her politeness but at the same time told her that he had much better cooks of his own whom his governor Leonidas had given him one of whom prepared him a good dinner and the other an excellent supper and these were temperance and exercise  Advancing still further into the country he received the voluntary submission of several of the kings of Lesser Asia and among others that of Mithridates king of Pontus who afterwards adhered to him with unshaken fidelity and accompanied him in his expedition This man was the predecessor of the famous Mithridates who so long employed the armies of Rome and makes so capital a figure in the history of that republic  Next year Alexander resolved to open the campaign very early But previous to his beginning his operations he held a consultation with his principal officers whether he should march directly in quest of Darius or first subdue the other maritime provinces The latter opinion appeared the most prudent as by that means he would be freed from all apprehensions of being molested in his rear and would leave every thing quiet and secure behind  him Proceeding therefore through a narrow defile near the seashore where the water was so high that his men were up to the middle in passing it he advanced to Coelenoe a city of Phrygia situated on the banks of the river Marsyas which the fictions of the poets have rendered so famous This place he immediately invested The garrison at first made some show of resistance But finding themselves unable to withstand the vigorous and repeated assaults of the Grecians they promised to surrender at the end of sixty days provided they were not relieved within that period and as no aid arrived within the stipulated time the place was delivered up according to agreement  From thence Alexander marched to Gordium the supposed residence of the celebrated king Midas Here he was desirous of seeing the famous chariot to which the Gordian knot was tied This knot which fastened the yoke to the beam was tied with so much intricacy that it was impossible to discover where the involutions began or where the cords terminated According to an ancient tradition of the country an oracle had declared that the man who could untie it should possess the empire of Asia Alexander being firmly persuaded that the oracle was meant for him after many fruitless trials instead of attempting to untie it in the usual manner drew his sword and cut it in pieces crying out that that was the only way to untie The priest hailed the omen and declared that Alexander had fulfilled the oracle  In the mean time Darius who now began to be seriously alarmed for the safety of his empire resolved to raise an army that might enable him to stop the further progress of the enemy Alexander however still continued to advance and having subdued Paphlagonia and Cappadocia he passed the straits of Cilicia where he might easily have been  opposed by a handful of men but the enemy abandoned them as soon as he approached From thence he marched his whole army to the city of Tarsus where he arrived just in time to save it from destruction as the Persians had set fire to it to prevent his becoming master of the treasures it contained And here he gave an instance of that magnanimity and elevation of mind which formed so distinguished a part of his character For having thrown himself into the river Cydnus which runs through this city in order to bathe he was instantly seized with such a violent shivering as seemed likely in a little time to put an end to his life At first all his physicians were afraid to administer the necessary medicines knowing they must be answerable for the consequences that ensued But at last one of them whose name was Philip who had always attended upon Alenxander from his youth and loved him with the utmost tenderness not only as his sovereign but his child raising himself above all prudential considerations and being more concerned for the life of his prince than his own safety offered to give him a dose which though not violent would be speedy in its effects and desired three days to prepare it At this proposal every one trembled except Alexander himself who was afflicted on no other account than because it would keep him so long from appearing at the head of his army  In the mean time he received a letter from Parmenio who had been left behind in Cappadocia advising him to beware of Philip his physician for that Darius had bribed him by the promise of a thousand talents and his sister in marriage This letter at first gave him some uneasiness as he could not believe that Parmenio had wrote it without having received some such intelligence But confidence in a physician whose unshaken fidelity and  attachment he had experienced from his youth at last removed all suspicion He therefore put the letter under his bolster without acquainting anyone with the contents and when Philip entered with the medicine he readily took it from him and holding the letter in one hand and the cup in the other he delivered the former to Philip while he himself drank off the draught without discovering the least sign of fear This was a very singular and affecting scene Alexander looking at Philip with all the marks of the most perfect confidence and assurance while Philip in perusing the letter seemed astonished at the accusation and called upon the gods to witness his innocence sometimes lifting up his hands to heaven and then throwing himself down by the bedside and beseeching Alexander to lay aside all suspicion and rely on his fidelity At first the medicine worked so violently and brought Alexander so low as seemed to favour Parmenio's accusation but at length it produced the desired effect and the king in a few days recovered his wonted vigour  Meanwhile Darius was advancing against him at the head of an immense army of which however he did not know how to avail himself for instead of remaining in the open country where he might have extended his forces and surrounded the enemy he foolishly marched into the narrow passes where his great superiority of numbers could be of very little service The reason he assigned for taking this precipitate step was that he was afraid Alexander would escape him But this was a needless fear Alexander was as desirous of meeting him as he was of meeting Alexander His courtiers however encouraged him in the opinion that Alexander was endeavouring to avoid him and that if once he could bring this invader of his empire to an engagement he might depend upon obtaining  a complete victory There was one man indeed in his army who had the courage and the honesty to tell him the truth This was Caridemus the Athenian of whom when Darius asked whether he thought him strong enough to defeat the enemy Caridemus replied in the following terms  "Permit me Sir to speak truth now when only my sincerity can be of service your present splendour your prodigious numbers which have drained the east may be terrible indeed to your effeminate neighbours but can be no way dreadful to a Macedonian army Discipline close combat courage is all their care every single man among them is almost himself a general These men are not to be repulsed by the stones of slingers or stakes burnt at the end none but troops armed like themselves can stop their career let therefore the gold and silver which glitters in your camp be exchanged for soldiers and steel for weapons for and hearts that are able to defend you"  Darius though naturally of a mild disposition had all his passions rouzed at the freedom of this man's advice he ordered him at once to be executed Caridemus all the time crying out that his avenger was at hand Darius had soon reason to repent his rashness and experienced when it was too late the truth of all that had been told him  That prince now advanced towards the river Euphrates but with a parade that more resembled the triumphal entry of a sovereign into his capital after some important victory than the march of a warrior who was going to put every thing to hazard of the sword Over his tent was exhibited the image of the sun in jewels while wealth and magnificence shone in every quarter of the army  First they carried before him silver altars on which lay fire called by them sacred and eternal and these were followed by the Magi singing hymns  after the manner of their country they were accompanied by three hundred and sixtyfive youths equalling the number of days in a year clothed in purple robes Afterwards came a chariot consecrated to Jupiter drawn by white horses and followed by a courser of prodigious size to whom they gave the name of the Sun's horse and the equerries were dressed in white each having a golden rod in his hand  Ten chariots adorned with sculptures in gold and silver followed Then marched a body of horse composed of twelve nations whose manners and customs were various and all armed in a different manner Next advanced those whom the Persians called The Immortals amounting to ten thousand who surpassed the rest of the barbarians in the sumptuousness of their apparel They all wore golden collars and were clothed in robes of gold tissue with vestments having sleeves to them quite covered with precious stones  Thirty paces from them followed those called the king's relations to the number of fifteen thousand in habits very much resembling those of women and more remarkable for the vain pomp of their dress than the glitter of their arms  Those called the Doriphori came after they carried the king's cloak and walked before his chariot in which he seemed to sit as on a high throne This chariot was enriched on both sides with images of the gods in gold and silver and from the middle of the yoke which was covered with jewels rose two statues a cubit in height the one representing war the other peace having a golden eagle with wings extended as ready to take flight  But nothing could equal the magnificence of the king he was clothed in a vest of purple striped with silver and over it a long robe glittering all over with precious stones that represented two falcons rushing from the clouds and pecking at one  another Around his waist he wore a golden girdle after the manner of women whence his scimitar hung the scabbard of which flamed all over with gems on his head he wore a tiara or mitre round which was a fillet of blue mixed with white  On each side of him walked two hundred of his nearest relations followed by two thousand pikemen whose pikes were adorned with silver and tipped with gold and lastly thirty thousand infantry who composed the rearguard These were followed by the king's horses four hundred in number all which were led  About one hundred or a hundred and twenty paces from thence came Sysigambis Darius's mother seated on a throne and his consort on another with the several female attendants of both queens riding on horseback Afterwards came fifteen large chariots in which were the king's children and those who had the care of their education with a band of eunuchs who are to this day in great esteem in the east Then marched the concubines to the number of three hundred and sixty in the equipage of queens followed by six hundred mules and three hundred camels which carried the king's treasure and guarded by a grea  body of archers After these came the wives of the crownofficers and of the greatest lords of the court seated also in chariots and then the suttlers servants and other followers of the army In the rea  were a body of lightarmed troops with their commanders who closed the whole march  Such was the splendor of this pageant monarch who while he excited the admiration of his own barbarous subjects inspired the Macedonians with nothing but contempt for his military skill and  strong desire to make themselves masters of those riches of which he made so vain and pompous a display  Alexander and Darius being equally eager to come to an engagement were now advancing against each other and after various marches and countermarches they at last met in the neighbourhood of Issus  The spot where the battle was fought and which lay near this city was bounded on one side by the mountains and on the other by the sea The plain that was situated between them must have been of considerable extent as the two armies encamped in it and Darius's army as we have already observed was vastly numerous The river Pinarus ran through the middle of this plain from the mountain to the sea and divided it nearly into two equal parts  Alexander drew up his army in the following order He posted at the extremity of the right wing which stood near the mountains the Argyraspides commanded by Nicanor then the phalanx of Coenus and afterwards that of Perdiccas which terminated in the center of the main army On the extremity of the left wing he posted the phalanx of Amyntas then that of Ptolemy and lastly that of Meleager Thus the famous Macedonian phalanx was formed which we find was composed of six distinct bodies Each of these were headed by able generals but Alexander being always generalissimo had consequently the command of the whole army The horse were placed on the two wings the Macedonians with the Thessalians on the right and the Peloponnesians with the other allies on the left Parmenio commanded the left wing Alexander himself conducted the right while the Agrians led on by Attalus and some other troops lately arrived from Greece were destined to oppose those whom Darius had posted on the mountains  As for Darius's army it was drawn up in the following order Having heard that Alexander was  advancing against him in battle array he commanded thirty thousand horse and twenty thousand bowmen to cross the river Pinarus to keep the enemy in awe and give him time to draw up his army on the hither side without interruption In the center he posted the thirty thousand Greeks in his service who doubtless were the flower and chie strength of his army and were not at all inferior in bravery to the Macedonian phalanx with thirty thousand barbarians on their right and as many or their left The field of battle not being able to contain a greater number these were all that were placed in the front line the rest being ranged behind them and no doubt to a very great depth considering the multitude of the Persian forces On the mountain which lay to the left against Alexander's right wing Darius posted twenty thousand men who were so disposed in the several windings of the mountains that some of them were before Alexander's army and others behind it  Darius having put his army in battle array and appointed commanders to the different parts of it took post himself in the center according to the custom of the Persian monarchs He was determined to keep on the hither side of the river that so if the Macedonians attempted to cross it he might attack them while in the middle of the stream and oblige them to fight in that disadvantageous situation  This however was not sufficient to damp the spirit nor to check the progress of Alexander He boldly advanced to the side of the river and plunging into it with great impetuosity notwithstanding the showers of arrows that were poured upon him by the Persians he soon gained the opposite shore where attacking the enemy sword in hand he threw them in a little time into confusion Eagerly desiring to engage Darius and to have the glory o  killing him with his own hand he was just upon the point of charging that monarch when Oxathres Darius's brother observing the danger to which he was exposed rushed before his chariot with the horse he commanded This though it saved Darius's life was the immediate cause of the loss of the battle The horses that drew his chariot became so unruly and shook the yoke with so much violence that they almost overturned the king who seeing himself going to fall alive into the hands of his enemies leaped down and mounted another chariot The rest observing this fled as fast as possible and throwing down their arms made the best of their way Alexander received a slight wound in his thigh but it was not attended with any bad consequences  In the mean time while the Macedonians under their king had routed the Persians under Darius the rest of them who were engaged with the Greeks met with a stouter and more obstinate resistance but Alexander having pursued the fugitives a short way returned immediately to the field of battle and attacking the Grecians vigorously in flank he gave them a total and complete overthrow The enemy now made no further resistance but fled prec  pitately on all sides Some of them struck into the high road which led directly to Persia others ran into woods and lonely mountains and a small number returned to their camp which the victorious army had already taken and plundered In this battle sixty thousand of the Persian infantry and ten thousand horsemen were slain forty thousand were taken prisoners while of Alexander's army were fell but two hundred and eighty in all  With regard to Darius the instant he saw his left wing broke he was one of the first who fled in  s chariot but getting afterwards into craggy  gged places he mounted on horseback throwing  away his bow shield and royal mantle and had it not been for the necessity Alexander was under of desisting from the pursuit in order to return and complete the overthrow of the Greeks he would probably have fallen alive into the hands of the conqueror  Sysigambis Darius's mother and that monarch's queen who was also his sister were found remaining in the camp with two of the king's daughters his son yet a child and some Persian ladies for the rest had been carried to Damascus with part of Darius's treasure and all such things as contributed only to the luxury and magnificence of his court No more than three thousand talents were found in his camp but the rest of the treasure fell afterwards into the hands of Parmenio at the taking of the city of Damascus  The evening after the engagement Alexander invited his chief officers to a feast at which himself presided notwithstanding the wound he had that day received in battle The festivity however had scarce begun when they were interrupted by sad lamentations from a neighbouring tent which at first they considered as a fresh alarm but they were soon informed that the noise came from the tent in which the wife and mother of Darius were kept who were expressing their sorrow for the supposed death of that monarch An eunuch who had seen his cloak in the hands of a soldier imagining he was killed brought them these dreadfu  tidings Alexander immediately sent Leonatas one of his principal officers to undeceive them and next day he himself paid them a visit when he did every thing in his power to comfort and solace them He told them that no part of their former state should be withheld from them but that they should enjoy every convenience and accommodation as in the court of Darius Observing the infant son o  Darius standing by his mother he took him in his arms The child without discovering the least sign of terror stretched out his arms to the conqueror who being affected with its confidence said to Hephaestion who attended him Oh that Darius had some share some portion of this infant's generosity That he might prevent every suspicion of design on the chastity of Darius's consort and at the same time remove every cause of fear or anxiety from her mind he resolved never to visit her tent more although she was one of the most beautiful women of her time This moderation so becoming in a royal conqueror gave occasion to that noted observation of Plutarch  "That the princesses of Persia lived in an enemy's camp as if they had been in some sacred temple unseen unapproached and unmolested"  Sysigambis was distinguished by extraordinary marks of Alexander's favour Darius himself  ould not have treated her with greater respect than  d that generous prince He allowed her to regulate the funerals of all the Persians of the royal family who had fallen in battle and at her intercession he pardoned several of Darius's nobles who had justly  ncurred his displeasure This magnanimous contact has done more honour to Alexander's character  an all his splendid victories The gentleness of  s manners to the suppliant captives his chastity and continence when he had it in his power to en  ce obedience were setting an example to he  oes which it has been the pride of many since to  tate  The victory at Issus was soon followed by a va  ty of other successes All Phoenicia except  re the capital city submitted to Alexander  the same time Aristodemus the Persian ad  al was defeated at sea and a great part of his  eet taken The city of Damascus too in which  Darius's treasures were deposited surrendered t  Parmenio This place might have made a vigorou  defence but by the treachery of the governor i  was yielded up without making the least resistance  Parmenio found in it besides an immense sum o  money and a vast quantity of plate and baggage  three hundred and twentynine of Darius's con+cubines and a multitude of officers whose busines  it was to regulate every thing relating to that mo+narch's entertainments  In the mean time Darius having travelled a  night on horseback arrived in the morning at So+chus where he assembled the remains of his army Dejected as he was with his late misfortune stil  however his pride did not desert him He wrote letter to Alexander in which he rather treated him as an inferior He commanded rather than re+quested him to deliver up his wife mother an  children upon receiving a proper ransom Wit  regard to the empire he would fight with him so it upon equal terms and bring an equal number o  troops into the field To this Alexander replied that he scorned to hold any correspondence with  man whom he had already overcome that if he ap+peared before him in a suppliant posture he wou  give up his wife and mother without ransom tha  he knew how to conquer and to oblige th  conquered  This proposal having produced no effect Alex+ander proceeded to receive the submission of th  neighbouring states and people The Sidonia  were the first that made him a tender of their all  +giance in opposition to Strato their king who ha  declared in favour of Darius Alexander dethron  him and permitted Hephaestion his principal f  +vourite to elect in his stead whomsoever of t  Sidonians he should judge most worthy of that ex+alted station  Hephaestion was quartered at the house of two brothers who were young and of the most considerable family in the city and to these he offered the crown But they refused it telling him that according to the laws of their country no person could ascend the throne unless he were of the blood royal Hephaestion admiring this greatness of soul which could contemn what others strive to obtain by fire and sword  "continue" says he to them "in this way of thinking you who seem sensible that it is much more glorious to refuse a diadem than to accept it However name me some person of the royal family who may remember when he is king that it was you that set the crown on his head"  The brothers observing that several through excessive ambition aspired to this high station and to obtain it paid a servile court to Alexander's favourites declared that they did not know any person more worthy of the diadem than one Abdolonymus descended though in a remote degree from the royal family but who at the same time was so poor that he was obliged to earn his bread by manual labour in a garden without the city His honesty and integrity had reduced him like many more to such extreme poverty Wholly busied about his humble occupation he did not hear the clashing of the arms which had shaken all Asia  Hephaestion approving of their choice the two brothers went in quest of Abdolonymus whom they found weeding in his garden When they saluted him king he began at first to stare at them and thinking they were in jest not in earnest asked them whether they were not ashamed to offer him such an insult But as he made a greater resistance than suited their inclinations they themselves washed him and throwing over his shoulders a purple robe richly embroidered with gold they  repeatedly assured him that he was now king Sidon and conducted him to the palace  The news of this were immediately sprea  over the whole city Most of the inhabitan  were overjoyed at it but some murmure  especially the rich who despising Abdolony+mus's former abject state could not help expre  +sing their resentment at his present elevation Alex+ander therefore commanded the newelecte  prince to be sent for and after surveying him ve  attentively said  "Thy air and mien do not con+tradict what is related of thy extraction but I shoul  be glad to know with what frame of mind the borest thy poverty"  "Would to the gods r  +piled he that I may bear this crown with equ  patience These hands have procured me all I d  +sired and whilst I possessed nothing I wanted no+thing"  This answer gave Alexander an high ide  of Abdolonymus's virtue so that he not only pr  +sented him with the rich furniture which had b  +longed to Strato and part of the Persian plunde  but likewise annexed one of the neighbouring pro+vinces to his dominions  All Phoenicia as we have already observed wa  now subdued except Tyre the capital city Th  city was justly entitled the queen of the sea the element bringing to it the tribute of all nation  She boasted her having first invented navigation and taught mankind the art of braving the wind and waves by the assistance of a frail bark Th  happy situation of Tyre at the upper end of the Mediterranean the conveniency of its ports which were both safe and capacious and the character of its inhabitants who were industrious haborious patient and extremely courteous to strangers invited thither merchants from all parts of the globe so that it might be considered not  much as a city belonging to any particular nation as the common city of all nations and the centre of their commerce  Alexander thought it necessary both for his glory and his interest to take this city The spring was now coming on Tyre was at that time seated in an island of the sea about a quarter of a league from the continent It was surrounded with a strong wall an hundred and fifty feet high which the waves of the sea washed and the Carthaginians a colony from Tyre a mighty people and sovereigns of the ocean promised to come to the assistance of their parent state Encouraged therefore by these favourable circumstances the Tyrians determined not to surrender but to hold out the place to the last extremity This resolution however imprudent was certainly magnanimous but it was soon after followed by an act which was as blameable as the other was praiseworthy Alexander was desirous of gaining the place rather by treaty than by force of arms and with this view he sent heralds into the town with offers of peace but the inhabitants were so far from listening to his proposals or endeavouring to avert his resentment by any kind of concession that they actually killed his ambassadors and threw their bodies from the top of the walls into the sea It is easy to imagine what effect so shocking an outrage must produce in a mind like Alexander's He instantly resolved to besiege the place and not to desist till he had made himself master of it and razed it to the ground  As Tyre was divided from the continent by an arm of the sea there was necessity for filling up the intermediate space with a bank or pier before the p  ace could be closely invested This work accordingly was immediately undertaken and in a great measure completed when all the wood of which it was principally composed was unexpectedly  burned by means of a fireship sent in by the enemy The damage however was very soon repaired and the mole rendered more perfect than formerly and carried nearer to the town when all of a sudden a furious tempest arose which undermining the stonework that supported the wood laid the whole at once in the bottom of the sea  Two such disasters following so close on the heels of each other would have cooled the ardour of almost any man except Alexander but nothing could daunt his invincible spirit or make him relinquish an enterprize he had once undertaken He therefore resolved to prosecute the siege and in order to encourage his men to second his views he took care to inspire them with a belief that heaven was on their side and would soon crown their labours with the wishedfor success At one time he gave out that Apollo was about to abandon the Tyrians to their doom and that to prevent his flight they had bound him to his pedestal with a golden chain at another he pretended that Hercules the tutelar deity of Macedon had appeared to him and having opened prospects of the most glorious kind had invited him to proceed to take possession of Tyre These favourable circumstances were announced by the augurs as intimations from above and every heart was of consequence cheered The soldiers as if but that moment arrived before the city now forgetting all the toils they had undergone and the disappointments they had suffered began to raise a new mole at which they worked incessantly  To protect them from being annoyed by the ships of the enemy Alexander fitted out a fleet with which he not only secured his own men but offered the Tyrians battle which however they thought proper to decline and withdrew all their gallies into the harbour  The besiegers now allowed to proceed unmolested went on with the work with the utmost vigour and in a little time completed it and brought it close to the walls A general attack was therefore resolved on both by sea and land and with this view the king having manned his gallies and joined them together with strong cables ordered them to approach the walls about midnight and attack the city with resolution But just as the assault was going to begin a dreadful storm arose which not only shook the ships asunder but even shattered them in a terrible manner so that they were all of them obliged to be towed towards the shore without having made the least impression on the city  The Tyrians were elated with this gleam of good fortune but their joy was but of short duration for in a little time after they received intelligence from Carthage that they must expect no assistance from that quarter as the Carthaginians themselves were then overawed by a powerful army of Syracusans who had invaded their country Reduced therefore to the hard necessity of depending entirely upon their own strength and their own resources the Tyrians sent all their women and children to Carthage and prepared to encounter the very last extremities For now the enemy were attacking the place with greater spirit and activity than ever And to do the Tyrians justice it must be acknowledged that they employed a number of methods of defence which considering the rude state of the art of war at that early period were really astonishing They warded off the darts discharged from the balistas against them by the assistance of turningwheels which either broke them to pieces or carried them another way They deadened the violence of the stones that were hu  led at them by setting up sails and curtains made of a soft substance which easily gave way  To annoy the ships which advanced against their walls they fixed grappling irons and scythes to joists or beams then straining their catapultas an enormous kind of crossbow they laid those great pieces of timber upon them instead of arrows and shot them off on a sudden at the enemy these crushed some of their ships by their great weight and by means of the hooks or hanging scythes tore others to pieces They also had brazen shields which they drew redhot out of the fire and filling these with burning sand hurled them in an instant from the top of the wall upon the enemy There was nothing the Macedonians dreaded so much as this fatal instrument for the moment the burning sand got to the flesh through the crevices of the armour it penetrated to the very bone and stuck so close that there was no pulling it off so that the soldiers throwing down their arms and tearing their clothes to pieces were in this manner exposed naked and defenceless to the shot of the enemy  Alexander finding the resources and even the courage of the Tyrians increased in proportion as the siege continued resolved to make a last effort and attack them at once both by sea and land in order if possible to overwhelm them with the multiplicity of dangers to which they would be thus exposed With this view having manned his gallies with some of the bravest of his troops he commanded them to advance against the enemy's fleet while he himself took post at the head of his men on the mole And now the attack began on all sides with irresistible and unremitting fury Whereever the batteringrams had beat down any part of the wall and the bridges were thrown out instantly the Argyraspides mounted the breach with the utmost valour being led on by Admetus one of the bravest officers in the army who was killed by  the thrust of a spear as he was encouraging his soldiers  The presence of the king and the example he set fired his troops with unusual bravery He himself ascended one of the towers on the mole which was of a prodigious height and there was exposed to the greatest dangers he had ever yet encountered for being immediately known by his insignia and the richness of his armour he served as a mark for all the arrows of the enemy On this occasion he performed wonders killing with javelins several of those who defended the wall then advancing nearer to them he forced some with his sword and others with his shield either into the city or the sea the tower on which he fought almost touching the wall He soon ascended the wall followed by his principal officers and possessed himself of two towers and the space between them The batteringrams had already made several breaches the fleet had forced its way into the harbour and some of the Macedonians had possessed themselves of the towers which were abandoned The Tyrians seeing the enemy masters of their rampart retired towards an open place called Agenor and there stood their ground but Alexander marching up with his regiment of bodyguards killed part of them and obliged the rest to fly At the same time Tyre being taken on that side which lay towards the harbour a general carnage of the citizens ensued and none were spared except the few that fell into the hands of the Sidonians in Alexander's army who considering the Tyrians as countrymen granted them protection and carried them privately on board their ships The numbers that were slaughtered on this occasion are almost incredible even after conquest the victor's resentment did not subside he ordered no less than two thousand men who were taken in the storm  to be nailed to crosses along the the shore The number of prisoners amounted to thirty thousand and were all sold as slaves in different parts of the world Thus fell Tyre that had been for many ages the most flourishing city in the world and had spread the arts of commerce into the remotest regions  While Alexander was employed in the siege of Tyre he received a second letter from Darius in which that monarch treated him with greater respect than before He now gave him the title of king he offered him ten thousand talents as a ransom for his captive mother and queen and he promised him his daughter Statira in marriage with all the country he had conquered as far as the river Euphrates provided he would agree to a peace These terms were so advantageous that when the king debated upon them in council Parmenio one of his generals could not help observing that he would certainly accept of them were he Alexander  "And so would I" replied the king "were I Parmenio"  But deeming it inconsistent with his dignity to listen to any proposals from a man whom he had so lately overcome he haughtily rejected them and scorned to accept of that as a favour which he already considered as his own by conquest  From Tyre Alexander marched to Jerusalem fully determined to punish that city for having refused to supply his army with provisions during the siege but his resentment was mollified by a deputation of the citizens coming out to meet him with their highpriest  Jaddua  before them dressed in white and having a mitre on his head on the front of which the name of God was written The moment the king perceived the highpriest he advanced towards him with an air of the most profound respect bowed his body adored the august name upon  his front and saluted him who wore it with religious veneration And when some of his courtiers expressed their surprise that he who was adored by every one should adore the highpriest of the Jews  "I do not" said he "adore the highpriest but the God whose minister he is for whilst I was at Dium in Macedonia my mind wholly fixed on the great design of the Persian war as I was revolving the methods how to conquer Asia this very man dressed in the same robes appeared to me in a dream exhorted me to banish my fear bade me cross the Hellespont boldly and assured me that God would march at the head of my army and give me the victory over the Persians"  This speech delivered with an air of sincerity no doubt had its effect in encouraging the army and establishing an opinion that his mission was from heaven  From Jerusalem he went to Gaza where having met with a more obstinate resistance than he expected he cut the whole garrison consisting of ten thousand men to pieces and not satisfied with this act of cruelty he caused holes to be bored through the heels of Boetis the governor and tying him with cords to the back of his chariot he dragged him in this manner round the walls of the city This he did in imitation of Achilles whom Homer describes as having dragged Hector round the walls of Troy in the same manner but it was reading the poet to very little or rather indeed to very bad purpose to imitate his hero in the most unworthy part of his character  Alexander having left a garrison in Gaza turned his arms towards Egypt of which he made himself master without opposition Here he formed the design of visiting the temple of Jupiter which was situated in the sandy deserts of Lybia at the distance of twelve days journey from Memphis the capital of Egypt His chief view in going thither was to  get himself acknowledged the son of Jupiter an honour he had long aspired to In this journey he founded the city of Alexandria which soon became one of the most capital towns in the world for commerce Nothing could be more dreary than the desert through which he passed nor any thing more charming according to the fabulous accounts of the poets than the particular spot where the temple was situated It was a perfect paradise in the midst of an immeasurable wild At last having reached the place and appeared before the altar of the deity the priest who was no stranger to Alexander's wishes declared him to be the son of Jupiter The conqueror elated with this high compliment asked whether he should have success in his expedition the priest answered that he should be monarch of the world The conqueror enquired if his father's murderers were punished the priest replied that his father Jupiter was immortal but that the murderers of Philip had been all extirpated  From this time forward Alexander supposed himself or would have it supposed by others that he was the son of Jupiter Transported however as he was with the idea of being of divine origin he never forgot the duties of humanity nor even those of generosity to his female captives For Statira Darius's consort dying in childbed about this period he honoured her with as grand and magnificent a funeral as she could have received had she expired in her husband's palace Darius was so deeply affected with this act of magnanimity in his enemy that upon receiving the first intelligence of it he is said to have lift up his eyes to heaven and to have expressed himself thus  "Ye Gods the guardians of our births and who decree the fate of nations grant that I may be enabled to leave the Persian state as rich and flourishing as I sound  it that I may have it in my power to make Alexander a proper return for his generosity to the dearest objects of my affection But if the duration of this empire is near at an end and the greatness of Persia about to be forgotten may none but Alexander be permitted to sit on the throne of Cyrus"  Generous however as Alexander was to the wife and mother of Darius he still refused to listen to any terms of accommodation from that monarch himself who was therefore obliged to assemble another army in order at least to make one effort more for the preservation of his crown and empire He accordingly exerted himself with great spirit and activity and in a little time was able to raise a second army half as numerous again as the former and with this he now advanced towards the Tigris in order if possible to prevent Alexander from passing that river This however he was not able to effect Alexander passed the Tigris with greater ease and rapidity than he had passed the Granicus and drawing up his army on the farther bank he continued there encamped for two days in expectation of the enemy But finding that Darius was not disposed to come in search of him he resolved to go in quest of Darius The minds of his men however were considerably damped by an eclipse of the moon which happened about that time for as the cause of this phaenomenon was not then known it was always supposed to be the prognostic of some great calamity But Alexander who was as good a politician as a soldier immediately produced some Egyptian soothsayers who declared that the eclipse portended calamities not to the Greeks but to the Persians And having by this artful contrivance revived the spirits of his men he led them on to meet the enemy and began his march at midnight  At break of day he received intelligence that Darius was but twenty miles distant and at the same time a messenger arrived from that monarch with fresh proposals of peace which were still more advantageous than the former But Alexander rejected all his offers proudly replying that the world would not admit of two suns nor of two sovereigns All hopes of accommodation therefore being now cut off both sides prepared themselves for battle equally irritated and equally ambitious Darius pitched his camp in a plain near the village of Gangamela and at some distance from the city of Arbela from which last place the battle that ensued is usually denominated  Alexander being informed of this continued his march till he arrived within a few miles of the enemy He there encamped and having rested four days in order to refresh his army he set out on the evening of the fifth with a view of attacking Darius at daybreak but upon his arrival at the mountains where he could discover the enemy's army he made a halt and having assembled his general officers he held a consultation with them whether they should engage immediately or pitch their camp in that place The latter expedient was deemed the most eligible as it would give them an opportunity of viewing the field of battle and the manner in which the enemy were drawn up They therefore encamped in the same order in which they marched and in the mean time Alexander at the head of his light armed infantry and his royal regiments marched round the plain in which the battle was to be fought  Parmento advised him to attack the enemy by night and take them by surprize as by this means he would be sure of giving them a complete overthrow but Alexander replied that he scorned to steal a victory and that he was determined to fight  and conquer in broad daylight So confident indeed was he of success that the night immediately preceding the action he slept more soundly than he commonly was wont to do so that Parmenio was obliged to awake him in the morning and upon that general's expressing some surprise at his calmness and composure on the eve of a battle in which his whole fortune lay at stake  "How can I replied he be otherwise than calm when I see that the enemy is come to deliver himself into my hands"  So saying he took up his arms mounted his horse and rode up and down the ranks exhorting his men to behave gallantly and if possible to surpass their former fame and the glory they had already acquired  The issue of this battle was such as might naturally be expected from the character of the combatants On the one side was a middling army of forty thousand foot and about seven or eight thousand horse but these were the bravest and best disciplined troops at that time in the world on the other was a vast and almost innumerable assemblage of men rather than of soldiers without order without discipline and consequently without any common or well directed courage The Greeks indeed in Darius's pay formed an exception to this general character of his forces and they behaved on this as on every other occasion with a spirit worthy of their former fame But nothing could resist the ardour and impetuosity of Alexander at the head of his gallant Macedonians especially as he had taken care with his usual address to reinforce their native courage with the aid of superstition For in the very heat of the action Aristander the soothsayer clothed in his white robes and holding a branch of laurel in his hand advanced into the thickest of the fight according to the orders he had received from the king and crying out  that he saw an eagle hovering over Alexander's head a sure omen of victory he shewed with his finger the pretended bird to the soldiers who relying on the veracity of the soothsayer imagined that they saw it also and now believing themselves invincible they renewed the attack with greater spirit than ever and in a little time carried all before them  Alexander exposed himself to danger like the meanest soldier in his army He wounded Darius's equerry with a javelin and had not that prince saved himself by a precipitate flight he would probably have wounded or killed him likewise Alexander pursued the fugitives for a conderable way but was obliged to return in order to assist Parmenio who commanded the left wing and had not yet been able to break the Persian horse that opposed him These however he discomfited before the arrival of Alexander who met the enemy retiring from the field of battle and put them almost all to the sword And now the Persians being defeated every where betook themselves to flight and were hotly pursued by the Macedonians who committed terrible havock among them Alexander rode after Darius as far as Arbela hoping every moment to overtake him and he had almost done so for he reached that city just as Darius had quitted it but though the latter was thus able to save his person he was obliged to leave his treasure behind him which now fell into the hands of the enemy  Such was the issue of this famous battle which gave to Alexander the empire of Asia The loss of the Persians on this occasion was incredible It amounted according to Arrian to three hundred thousand men besides those who were taken prisoners whereas the loss of the Macedonians was comparatively speaking very inconsiderable it not  exceeding according to the same author twelve hundred men and most of these were cavalry  The dreadful defeat which Darius had now sustained struck such a terror into the neighbouring provinces that Alexander met with little or no more opposition in making himself master of the whole kingdom of Persia Babylon surrendered to him without striking a blow as did also Susa and in both these places he found immense treasures Leaving the mother and children of Darius in Susa he advanced into the country of the Uxii where he met with some slight resistance from Madathes the governor but this he soon overcame and pardoned Madathes at the intercession of Sysigambis to whom that satrap was nearly related Thence he continued his march towards Persepolis which he did with the greater expedition as he had received intelligence from Tiridates who commanded in that city that the inhabitants were preparing to plunder Darius's treasures but Alexander took care to prevent them by his unexpected arrival and distributed all the wealth he found there as well as in other places among the bravest and most deserving of his soldiers  As he approached this city he was met by a large body of men who exhibited a striking example of the exquisite misery which human beings are sometimes doomed to suffer These were about four thousand Greeks very far advanced in years who having been made prisoners of war had undergone all the torments which the Persian tyranny could inflict The hands of some had been cut off the feet of others and others again had lost their noses and ears They appeared like so many spectres rather than like men speech being almost the only thing by which they were known to be such Alexander could not refrain from tears at this sight and as they irresistibly moved him to  commiserate their condition he bade them with the utmost tenderness not to despond and assured them that they should again see their wives and country They chose however to remain in a place where misfortune was now became habitual he therefore rewarded them liberally for their sufferings and commanded the governor of the province to treat them with mildness and respect  Alexander upon his first entry into Persepolis was satisfied with the treasures he found there and seems not to have thought of wreaking his resentment upon any part of the city itself But one day having drank to excess at a public banquet and the conversation turning upon the cruelties committed by the Persians in Greece and particularly at Athens Thais an Athenian courtezan who was present seized this opportunity of saying that it was mean and pusillanimous in the highest degree not to take revenge for such repeated slaughters  "This day cried she has fully repaid all my wanderings and troubles in Asia by putting it in my power to humble the pride of the Persian monarchs To insult over the palace of Persepolis will be a noble deed but how much more glorious would it be to fire the palace of that Xerxes who laid the city of Athens in ruins and to have it told in future times that a single woman of Alexander's train had taken more signal vengeance on the enemies of Greece than all her former generals had been able to do"  All the guests applauded the discourse when immediately the king in a fit of phrenzy rose from table his head being crowned with flowers and taking a torch in his hand he advanced forward to execute his mad exploit The whole company followed him breaking out into shouts of joy and in a riotous manner with singing and dancing surrounded the palace All the rest of the Macedonians at this noise ran in  crowds with lighted torches and set fire to every part of it However Alexander soon repented of what he had done and thereupon gave orders for extinguishing the fire but it was now too late  In the mean time Darius continued his flight and at length arrived at Ecbatana the capital of Media But though he was able to escape the pursuit of his natural enemies he could not secure himself from the secret designs of his treacherous subjects Two of them in particular Nabarzanes and Bessus the one the general of the horse the other the commander of the Bactrians had entered into a plot to seize his person and either deliver him alive into the hands of Alexander if they were overtaken or if they escaped to put him to death and afterwards usurp his crown and begin a new war They even found means to draw over to their party all the forces of Darius except the Greeks in that monarch's pay who shocked at the baseness of his naturalborn subjects generously offered to protect his person at the hazard of their own lives But Darius was of too noble a spirit to accept of such a proposal and he therefore replied that if his own subjects would not grant him protection he could not think of receiving it from the hands of strangers The Greeks seeing they could be of no further service to him immediately threw themselves on the mercy of Alexander who in consideration of their gallant spirit not only forgave them but enrolled them among his own forces  Darius being thus left destitute of all kind of resource was seized by the traitors who put him in chains and carried him along with them for some time but finding that the Macedonians were in close pursuit of them and that it was impossible for them either to conciliate the friendship of Alexander  or to secure a crown for themselves they again set him at liberty and advised him to accompany them in their flight This however he refused to do and calling upon heaven to revenge the indignities they had already offered him he openly declared that he would rather trust to the mercy of Alexander than continue any longer in the hands of traitors At these words they fell into a furious passion and thrusting him through with their darts and spears they left him in that manner to linger out the remains of his wretched life The traitors then made their escape different ways while the victorious Macedonians at length coming up found Darius in a lonely place lying in his chariot and drawing near his end However he had strength enough before he died to call for drink which a Macedonian named Polystratus brought him The generosity of the unfortunate monarch shone forth on this melancholy occasion in the address he made to this stranger  "Now indeed said he I suffer the extremity of misery since it is not in my power to reward thee for this act of humanity"  He had a Persian prisoner whom he employed as his interpreter Darius after drinking the liquor that had been given him turned to the Macedonian and said that in the deplorable state to which he was reduced he however should have the comfort to speak to one who could understand him and that h  s last words would not be lost He therefore charged him to tell Alexander that he had died in his debt that he gave him many thanks for the great humanity he had exercised towards his mother his wife and his children whose lives he had not only spared but restored them to their former splendor that he besought the gods to give victory to his arms and make him sovereign of the universe and that he thought he need not entreat him  to revenge the execrable murder committed on his person as this was the common cause of kings  After this taking Polystratus by the hand  "give him" said he thy hand as I give thee mine and carry him in my name the only pledge I am able to give of my gratitude and affection"  Saying these words he breathed his last  Alexander upon coming up and viewing the dead body of Darius was deeply affected he generously paid it the tribute of a tear he caused it to be embalmed and inclosed in a magnificent coffin and he sent it to Sysigambis in order to be interred with the honours usually paid to the Persian monarchs At the same time he pursued the traitor Bessus and having taken him prisoner and cut off his nose and ears he caused him to be conveyed to Ecbatana there to suffer whatever punishment Darius's mother should think proper to inflict upon him He was accordingly put to death in the following manner Four trees were bent by main force all towards the same point and to each of these one of the limbs of this traitor's b  dy was fastened and then the trees being suffered t  return to their natural position they flew back with so much violence that each tore away the  mb that was fixed to it and so quartered him  It was about this time that Alexander is said to have received a visit from Thalestris queen of the Amazons but this circumstance though related as a fact by some historians is considered as a fable by the most judicious writers  Among the many good qualities of Alexander his gallantry and generosity to the female sex was not the least remarkable Of this he now gave a striking instance in his behaviour to a Persian female captive whom having discovered by her modest and reserved air while she was singing at  one of his public banquets to be a princess of the bloodroyal he not only set her at liberty but returned her all her possessions and even caused her husband Hystaspes to be sought for in order that she might be restored to him  The grandeur and elevation of Alexander's mind appears in nothing more conspicuous than this that he always accustomed his men to consider their present possessions however great as nothing in comparison of what he would one day bestow upon them Perceiving that they were now so encumbered with booty as to be incapable of marching with their usual celerity and dispatch he commanded them to carry all their baggage excepting only such things as were indispensably necessary into a large plain and there to commit it to the flames  We have hitherto beheld the fair side of Alexander's character We must now reverse the picture and take a view of his bad as well as his good qualities for no man ever had a more mixed character or united in a more eminent degree the extremes both of virtue and of vice Hearing that Philotas one of his chief favourites and who was likewise the son of Parmenio had received intelligence of a plot formed against him and had neglected to inform him of it he immediately concluded that that nobleman himself was concerned in the conspiracy and he accordingly had him first put to the rack and afterwards stoned to death Philotas in the agony of pain had acknowledged himself guilty and named several of his accomplices and among others his own father The consequence was that Parmenio though entirely innocent was likewise put to death and in this act Alexander was at once guilty of injustice cruelty and ingratitude for Parmenio had contributed more to the success of his arms than perhaps any of his other generals  In order to prevent the ill humour that might have been excited in the army by these acts of severity Alexander set out in quest of new nations whom he might subdue He totally extirpated the Branchiae merely on account of their being descended from some traiterous Greeks that had delivered up the treasures of a temple with which they had been entrusted The success of his arms against the Scythians is very problematical According to Arrian and Quintus Curtius he was able to make little or no impression on the bold and untractable spirit of these barbarians Curtius even says that the Scythians gave the Greeks so terrible a defeat that Alexander made it death for any one who had escaped from the battle to make the least mention of it He adds that they sent ambassadors to Alexander who had the courage to tell him to his face that he who pretended to have no other view in all his military enterprises than the extirpation of robbers was himself the greatest robber that existed It appears however that after taking and plundering the city of Cyropolis and crossing the river Jaxerthes he defeated a body of thirty thousand Scythians who were posted in a strong hold called Petra Oxiani and having met with a more obstinate resistance than he expected he reduced the common men to slavery and caused their leaders to be fixed to crosses at the bottom of the rock that formed the pass  Having thus opened to himself a way into the heart of the country he advanced first into the province of Barsaria and afterwards into that of Maracanda of which last he appointed Clitus governor But it was not long before this brave and deserving officer met with the same fate as Parmenio For having taken upon him at a public entertainment where he had drank too freely to depreciate the king's achievements in comparison of  those of his father Philip Alexander who was likewise very much intoxicated was so transported with passion that taking up a javelin he laid Clitus dead at his feet He had no sooner committed this barbarous action than he was seized with the deepest and most bitter affliction He threw himself upon the dead body he forced out the javelin and had he not been prevented by the bystanders he would instantly have plunged it in his own breast For some time he continued in a state of the deepest melancholy but at last having recovered his usual serenity he set out in quest of new adventures and entering the country of the Sacae he was met by Axertes one of its kings whose daughter Roxana he married  Having now subdued all the Persian provinces he resolved to carry his arms as far as India a country deemed at that time as well as at present one of the richest and most desirable in the world This country on both sides of the Ganges was then inhabited by a people not very unlike the present Gentoos or native Indians They were divided into seven casts or classes which always kept separate and distinct from each other no person of one class being permitted to intermarry with one of another nor any one being allowed to belong to two or more classes or to quit one class for another The first class consisted of the guardians of religion the second of husbandmen the third of shepherds the fourth of merchants and tradesmen including pilots and seamen the fifth of soldiers the sixth of magistrates and the seventh of persons employed in the public councils and who assisted the sovereign in the government of the state  Upon entering this country Alexander received the voluntary submission of most of the petty princes that reigned in it Having reduced Hagosa he attacked the rock of Aornos which was considered  as impregnable and was said to have foiled the prowess even of Hercules himself but the garrison struck with the vastness of his military preparations delivered it up after a very faint resistance This helped to inflame his natural pride and vanity in having been able so easily to make himself master of a fortress that had bid defiance to the might of the great founder of his race  From thence he proceeded towards the river Indus and continued his march to the banks of the Hydaspes receiving every where as he passed the submission of the neighbouring princes and among others that of Omphis who made him a present of fiftysix elephants There was one of them however named Porus who disdained to relinquish his independent situation without a struggle and Alexander therefore resolved to compel him by force of arms A bloody battle accordingly was fought between them and though Porus behaved with extraordinary valour and performed both the duty of an able commander and a gallant soldier being as remarkable for his great strength and stature as for his uncommon abilities he was yet obliged however unwillingly to resign the victory to his antagonist The loss of the Indians on this occasion was great amounting to no less than twenty thousand foot and three thousand horse whereas that of the Macedonians did not exceed two hundred and eighty foot and between thirty and forty horsemen  Alexander was so charmed with the extraordinary merit of Porus that he was extremely desirous of saving him from the general carnage that followed the battle He therefore sent a messenger after him entreating him to return which with some difficulty he was prevailed upon to do and when he came into the king's presence who the nearer he viewed him admired him the more  Alexander asked him how he wished to be treated  "Like a king"  replied Porus  "But" continued Alexander "do you ask nothing more"  "No" replied Porus "all things are included in that single word"  Alexander struck with this greatness of soul the magnanimity of which seemed heightened by distress did not only restore him his kingdom but annexed other provinces to it and treated him ever after with the highest marks of esteem and regard Porus continued faithful to him till his death It is hard to say whether the victor or the vanquished deserved most praise upon this occasion  Alexander built a city on the spot where the battle was fought and another in the place where he had crossed the Hydaspes He called the one Nicaea from his victory and the other Bucephalus in honour of his horse who died there not of wounds but of old age  Having now conquered Porus he advanced into the interior parts of India and as the people of that country were never remarkable for their military spirit he easily added it to his former dominions Passing by a place where there were several Brachmans or Indian Priests he was seized with a desire of conversing with them and of learning if possible something of the nature of their religion But hearing that these priests never made visits and thinking it below his dignity to visit them he sent Onesicritus the philosopher to wait upon them This man met in the neighbourhood of the city fifteen Brachmans who from morning till evening always stood naked in the same posture in which they had at first placed themselves and afterwards returned to the city at night He addressed himself first to Calanus an Indian reputed the wisest man of his country who though he professed the practice of the most severe philosophy had however  been persuaded in his extreme old age to attend upon the court and to him he told the occasion of his coming The latter gazing upon Onesicritus's clothes and shoes could not forbear laughing after which he told him  "That anciently the earth had been covered with barley and wheat as it was at that time with dust that besides water the rivers used to flow with milk honey oil and wine that man's guilt had occasioned a change of this happy condition and that Jupiter to punish their ingratitude had sentenced them to a long and painful labour that their repentance afterwards moving him to compassion he had restored them their former abundance however that by the course of things they seemed to be returning to their ancient confusion"  All nations even in the very lowest stages of society seem to have some notion of a happier state that preceded the present  Oneficritus endeavoured to persuade two of them named Mandanis and Calodanus to accompany him to Alexander telling them they would find him a generous benefactor The former haughtily rejected the proposal it was however accepted by the latter Alexander's chief ambition was to imitate Bacchus and Hercules in their expeditions into the east and he therefore resolved to penetrate like them as far as he could meet with new nations to conquer But now the Macedonians refused to follow him satiated as they were with spoil and worn out with repeated encounters and though he used every argument he could think of to overcome their obstinacy he yet could succeed no farther than to obtain their consent to attend him towards the south in order to discover the nearest ocean and to take the course of the river Indus for their guide  In his voyage down this river he gave a signal proof of that personal intrepidity for which he was so to remarkable for having landed his troops and  attacked the capital of the Oxydraci and the Mallis he seized a scalingladder and was the first that mounted the wall His attendants seeing his danger endeavoured to follow him but the ladder breaking he left alone upon which sword in hand he boldly leaped from the wall into the city which was crowded with enemies He repulsed such as were nearest him and he even killed the governor of the place who advanced in the throng Thus with his back to a tree that happened to be near he received all the darts of the enemy in his shield and kept even the boldest at a distance At last an Indian discharging an arrow of three feet in length it pierced his coat of mail and his right breast and so great a quantity of blood issued from the wound that he dropped his arms and lay as dead The Indian came to strip him supposing him really what he appeared but Alexander that instant recovered his spirits and plunged a dagger in his side By this time a part of the king's attendants had come to his succour and forming themselves round his body till the soldiers without found means to break the gates they thus saved him and put all the inhabitants without distinction to the sword  Having recovered of his wound in a few days he continued his voyage down the river subduing the country on each side as he passed along and at last having reached the shore he was struck with surprise at the high tides of the Indian ocean especially as he had never beheld any thing of the kind but the gentle floods of the Mediterranean where there can hardly be said to be any tides at all Here he put an end to his expedition and casting his eyes wistfully on the broad expanse of waters before him he is said to have wept at there being no more worlds left for him to conquer He now therefore resolved to direct his march homewards  and having appointed Nearchus admiral of his fleet with orders to proceed along the Indian shore as far as the Persian gulph he set out with his army for Babylon  The first part of this journey was attended with the greatest difficulties on account of the poverty of the country through which they passed and the consequent want of provisions but upon their arrival in the province of Gedrosia the richest district in that part of the world they found themselves surrounded with all the necessaries and conveniencies and even the luxuries of life nor were they backward in enjoying them The fact is like true soldiers they gave themselves up to every species of intemperance and excess Alexander still wishing to imitate Bacchus was drawn by eight horses on a scaffold in the form of a square stage where he passed the days and nights in feasting and his men at humble distance did not fail to follow his example Here he put Cleander to death whom he had left behind him as the governor of some provinces and who had grossly abused his authority during his master's absence As this man had the chief hand in cutting off the unhappy Parmenio this act of rigorous justice gave great satisfaction He likewise inflicted the same punishment upon six hundred soldiers whom Cleander had employed as the instruments of his extortion  In his way to Babylon he stopped at Pasargada in order to visit the tomb of Cyrus upon which was this humble but significant inscription"O man whosoever thou art or whencesoever thou comest I am Cyrus the founder of the Persian empire do not envy me this little quantity of earth which covers my body" Here Orsines a Persian prince being accused though falsely of having robbed this tomb was condemned to suffer a capital punishment Here too Calanus the Indian  having completed his eightythird year without disease or sickness and now feeling the approaches of old age resolved to put himself to a voluntary death agreeable to the strange superstition of the enthusiasts of his country A funeral pile accordingly was erected for him this after taking leave of his friends he boldly ascended and laying himself down upon it and covering his face he continued immoveably in that posture till he expired in the flames  From Pasargada Alexander proceeded to Susa where he married Statira the eldest daughter of Darius and at the same time gave her youngest sister in wedlock to his favourite Hephaestion and fourscore Persian ladies of rank to as many of his principal officers  But while he was thus amusing himself in Persia a commotion had like to have been excited in Greece Harpalus governor of Babylon having amassed immense riches and wishing to acquire an independent authority had gone over to Athens and endeavoured to engage the leading men in his interest and among others the illustrious Phocion whom we have already mentioned But this man lent a deaf ear to all his tempting offers and shewed himself to be as much proof against the seductions of Harpalus as he had formerly been against those of Philip and Alexander When Philip pressed him to accept of a large sum if not for himself at least for his family  "if my children" said Phocion "resemble me the little spot of ground upon the produce of which I have hitherto lived will be sufficient to maintain them if they do not I would not wish to leave them wealth merely to inflame their luxury and ambition"  And when Alexander sent him a hundred talents Phocion asked those who brought it why their master had presented him with so great a sum and did not remit any to the rest of the Athenians  "it is replied they because  he looks upon you as the only just and virtuous man in the state"  "Then rejoined Phocion let him suffer me still to enjoy that character and be really what I am taken for"  Harpalus disappointed in his hopes of success from this quarter was obliged to abandon the enterprize  This commotion was scarcely suppressed when another ensued and seemingly of a more dangerous nature Alexander had published a declaration by which all the Macedonians who from their age or infirmities were incapable of bearing the fatigues of war were ordered to return to Greece This they considered not only as the highest affront but even as the greatest injustice They therefore with seditious cries unanimously demanded to be entirely discharged from his service murmuring against him as a despiser of his bravest troops and as a cruel king who wanted their destruction and not their absence Alexander however on this trying occasion acted with that resolution which always marked his character Being seated on his tribunal of justice he rushed among the principal mutineers seized thirteen and ordered them to be immediately punished The soldiers amazed at his intrepidity withheld their complaints and with downcast eyes seemed to beg for mercy  "You desired a discharge" said he "go then and publish to the world that you have left your prince to the mercy of strangers from henceforth the Persians shall be my guards"  This menace was actually executed and filled the soldiers with such grief and consternation that they never ceased soliciting his forgiveness till at last he was prevailed upon to restore them to his favour  Being now secure from insurrection he gave himself up to mirth and jollity he spent whole days and nights in immoderate drinking and in one of those bacchanalian entertainments Hephaestion lost  his life As this was the greatest of all Alexander's favourites his death made a deep impression on his mind He seemed absolutely incapable of receiving consolation he even put to death the physician who attended him and on his arrival in Babylon he celebrated his funeral rites with the greatest pomp and magnificence  As he drew near to that city many sinister omens were observed on which account the Chaldeans who pretended to foresee future events endeavoured to dissuade him from entering it But the Greek philosophers displayed the futility of these predictions and advised him to pursue the course which his glory pointed out Babylon they told him was a proper theatre on which to display the greatness of his power as ambassadors were there expecting his arrival from all the nations he had lately conquered Accordingly after making a most magnificent entry he gave audience to the ambassadors with a grandeur and dignity suitable to his royal character yet with all the affability and politeness of a private courtier  As he intended to make Babylon the seat of his empire he began to form schemes for beautifying and improving that city But amidst all his amusements of this kind and though he had now attained to the height of his ambition he was far from being happy The recent loss of Hephaestion and the sad remembrance he still had of the murder of Clitus and of the barbarities exercised on Parmenio and his son Philotas the recollection I say of these shocking events festered in his mind and threw a gloom upon his spirits to dissipate which it was necessary to have recourse to some powerful remedy The remedy he employed was intemperance In consequence of this he was often invited to entertainments at which he drank immoderately On a particular occasion having spent the whole night in a debauch he was pressed to engage in a  second which he unhappily did and drank to such excess that he fell upon the floor in appearance dead and in this lifeless condition was carried a sad spectacle of debauchery to his palace The fever continued with some intervals in which he gave the necessary orders for the sailing of the fleet and the marching of his land forces being persuaded he should recover But at last finding himself past all hopes and his voice beginning to fail he gave his ring to Perdiccas with orders to convey his body to the temple of Ammon He struggled however with death for some time and raising himself upon his elbow he gave his hand to the soldiers who pressed in to kiss it Being then asked to whom he would leave his empire he answered  "To the most worthy"  Perdiccas inquiring at what time he should pay him divine honours he replied when you are happy With these words he expired being then upwards of thirtytwo years old of which he had reigned twelve with a glory and renown that no prince either before or since has ever been able to equal  As to his character it may be summed up in a few words Personal courage military skin unbounded generosity unexampled continence considering his youth his rank and the powerful temptations to which he was exposed such were his chief and most distinguished virtues but these were more than counterbalanced by his intemperance his cruelty his vanity and above all by his wild and insatiable ambition His victories however had one good effect They served to shew in how high a degree the arts of peace can promote those of war In this picture we becold a combination of petty states by the arts of refinement growing more than a match for the rest of the world united and leaving mankind an example of the superiority of intellect over brutal force Alexander left one son behind him he was named Hercules and was born  of Barsine the daughter of Artabazus and widow of Memnon Both Roxana and Statira are said to have been pregnant at the time of his death  CHAP XV TRANSACTIONS IN GREECE FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF THEBES TO THE DEATH OF ANTIPATER  WE now return to the affairs of Greece with which Alexander's expedition is in a great measure unconnected and hardly indeed bears any other relation to them than that it was carried on by Grecian forces When the general convention of the States of Greece declared Alexander their generalissimo against the Persians the Lacedaemonians were the only people that refused to concur in this appointment With a sagacity and penetration which did them honour they plainly foresaw that if that prince should succeed in his ambitious scheme of subduing the East it would not be long before he put a period to the small remains of Grecian liberty They therefore did every thing in their power to counteract his views they even entered into an alliance for this purpose with the Persian monarch and Agis at that time their king a brave active and enterprising prince son to Archidamus and grandson of the renowned Agesilaus exerted himself so strenuously upon this occasion that he actually brought over a good number of the other states of Greece to join in the confederacy against Macedon By this means he was enabled to raise an army of twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse with which he attacked Megalopolis the only city in Peloponnesus that had acknowledged Alexander for its sovereign Antipater  Alexander's viceroy in Macedon was not long in meeting him and that too with an army amounting to above double the number Agis however did not endeavour to avoid the contest a general action ensued and though the Macedonians gained the victory yet was it with the loss of three thousand five hundred of their best troops The same number fell on the other side and among the rest Agis the Spartan king one of the most illustrious characters to be found in antiquity His end was as glorious as his life had been virtuous Having received several wounds in the course of the action his soldiers endeavoured when the rout became general to carry him off on their shoulders but Agis seeing they were in danger of being surrounded commanded them to set him down and preserve themselves by flight for the future service of their country They did so he was accordingly left alone and on his knees he fought and killed several of the Macedonians whom he continued to engage till he was run through the body with a dart  The subsequent reigns of the Spartan kings were productive of few events that are worthy of notice Eudemidas the son of Agis succeeded him on the throne and happily at least for the tranquillity of his country his mind was as much turned to the arts of peace as his father's had been to those of war While the whole nation was burning with resentment at the loss of Agis and calling out for a renewal of hostilities against the Macedonians in order to revenge it Eudemidas alone restrained their military ardour And when a certain citizen asked him why he should recommend the continuance of peace when all his subjects were for war  "Because" replied the king "I wish to convince them that what they desire would be injurious to them"  When another of his subjects  was magnifying in his presence the victories which their ancestors had won from the Persians and was from thence drawing arguments for recommencing hostilities against Macedon  "You perhaps think" said Eudemidas "that it is the same thing to make war against a thousand sheep as against fifty wolves"  Going one day by chance into the school of Xenocrates the philosopher and observing that he was very old he asked those who stood next to him what was the old man's profession Upon being answered that he was a wise man who sought after virtue  "Alas" said he "is he seeking it at these years When then will he make use of it"  And when as we shall see afterwards Alexander caused the return of all the Greek exiles those of Thebes excepted to be proclaimed at the Olympic games  "'Tis a hard case O ye Thebans" said Eudemidas "but at the same time very honourable for it is evident that of all the Greeks Alexander fears you only"  Antipater having succeeded to his wish in crushing the insurrection in Peloponnesus and having cut off Agis who was the chief author of that insurrection resolved if possible to take out of the way every other person that was likely to dispute his master's authority and the first he pitched upon with this view was the celebrated Demosthenes whom he contrived to bring under a suspicion of having proved false to the interests of his country For though Harpalus as we have already observed could not corrupt Phocion he is said to have been more successful with Demosthenes who was now accused of having accepted a bribe of a golden cup and twenty talents Certain it is that when he was to have given his opinion with regard to the propriety of granting protection to a Macedonian culprit he appeared with his throat bound round with several rollers This was probably owing to a real cold he  had caught though his enemies alledged it was only a pretended one and a wit observed on the occasion  "that the orator had got a golden quinsey"  Be this as it will he was tried for bribery in the court of Areopagus and being found guilty was condemned in a fine of fifty talents and as this was a sum he was unable to pay he was therefore obliged to go into banishment But from this charge of bribery and corruption Demosthenes is fully vindicated both by Plutarch and Pausanias two of the most respectable authors of antiquity  Antipater having now rid himself of almost the only man in Greece that dared to question his master's authority Alexander resolved to try how far the minds of the people were prepared to submit to that yoke of slavery which he was determined to impose upon them With this view he caused it to be proclaimed at the Olympic games  "That all the Grecian exiles those only excepted who had been guilty of atrocious crimes should be forthwith restored to their respective cities and that those cities which should refuse to admit them should be compelled to it by force of arms"  This step however seems to have been rather premature Cowed is the minds of the people were by the repeated acts of oppression they had suffered they were not yet  posed to comply with an order which was a direct  version not only of all free but of all regular government They therefore began to make preparat  ons for a bold and vigorous resistance and being  e  ded by Leosthenes the Athenian who had already collected a good body of his countrymen they  n found themselves sufficiently strong to set Antipater at defiance  Such was the situation of affairs in Greece when the news of Alexander's death reached that country  ws which added greatly to the spirit and activity  f the insurgents It was at this time too that  Demosthenes was recalled from banishment as his eloquence and patriotism would be of the greatest service in uniting the different states of Greece in a general confederacy against the Macedonians He was chiefly opposed on this occasion by Pytheas a creature of Alexander's  "The Athenians" said Pytheas "may be likened unto ass's milk which is a certain indication of sickness being in any house into which it is brought for when they appear in any city we may with certainty pronounce that city to be distempered"  "True" answered Demosthenes "but as ass's milk is a restorative of health so are Athenian counsels of distempered states"  Antipater though greatly inferior to the confederates in number had the courage to give them battle but being defeated he took refuge in Lamia a city of Thessaly where he resolved to hold out till a reinforcement should arrive The Athenians were so elated with this success that some of them proposed declaring war in form against the Macedonians but from this they were dissuaded by Phocion who well knew their inability to maintain such a contest  "When do you think" said one of the principal citizens to him "will be the most proper time for going to war"  "When the young men" replied he "keep within the bounds of regularity when the rich are liberal in their donations and the orators cease to rob the state"  It was not long before Antipater received the supply of troops he expected and now thinking himself more than a match for the enemy he set out in quest of them and coming up with them in the neighbourhood of Cranon a city of Thessaly he there gave them a complete overthrow Enraged as he was at the Athenians more than at any of the other states of Greece on account of their having been the original authors and chief conductors  of this insurrection he refused to grant them peace upon any other terms than their delivering up Demosthenes and receiving into their city a Macedonian garrison  Demosthenes well knowing that he had incurred the resentment of Antipater beyond the possibility of forgiveness fled immediately to Calauria a small island in the neighbourhood and there took refuge in the temple of Neptune He was followed thither by Archias a player whom Antipater sent after him in order to bring him back Archias used every argument he could think of to persuade him to return telling him that Antipater would treat him humanely But Demosthenes who knew better than Archias what were the dispositions of Antipater said  "O Archias I was never much moved with you as a player and now I am as little moved with you as a negociator"  When Archias began to press him hard he begged leave to withdraw a little farther into the temple in order to write a few lines to his family When he had got to the place where he was to write he put a poisoned quill into his mouth and chewed it as he usually did other quills when he was very thoughtful The poison beginning to operate he turned towards the tragedian and said  "Now sir you may act the part of Creon in the tragedy and cast out this body of mine unburried"  He desired to be supported to the door of the temple that he might not pollute it by his death but as he passed by the altar he expired  By the death of this great man and that of Agis Antipater established his authority in Athens and in most of the other states upon a firm foundation and even so far gained upon the affections of the people by the mild use he made of his power that he received from them the honourable appellation of The father and protector of Greece With the  Aetolians however he was not equally successful That people were so dissatisfied with the terms granted them at the late pacification that they were determined either to obtain better or to risk every thing in the field With this view they raised a large army with which they invaded the territories of Macedon but though they gained at first some petty advantages especially during Antipater's absence in Asia whither he had been obliged to go in order to counteract the designs of Perdiccas who was planning an insurrection in that part of the world yet were they finally defeated and compelled to submit to their former masters  Even the Athenians though less displeased than any of the other states of Greece with the conduct of Antipater yet felt their pride hurt at their city's being defended by a Macedonian garrison and they therefore wished to free themselves from this badge of slavery They first entreated Phocion to use his good offices with Antipater for this purpose but that patriot declined the commission well knowing that his countrymen were now become too effeminate to be left entirely to their own protection They therefore deputed the orator Demades to wait upon Antipater and solicit the recal of the garrison This is the same Demades we have already mentioned as the enemy of Demosthenes He was a man of some abilities but of more vanity and of a most venal disposition Antipater used to say that he had two friends at Athens Phocion who would never accept of any reward for his services and Demades who never thought he had received enough Whether Antipater had discontinued his largesses to Demades or whether Demades expected to be more liberally rewarded by Perdiccas we cannot say but he had entered into a correspondence with that commander and had recommended to him to come over and assume the  government of Macedon and Greece A letter of his to Perdiccas was found in which were these words  "Come and be the support of Macedon and Greece which at present lean on an old rotten staff"  meaning Antipater This discovery was made at the very time that he and his son were endeavouring to obtain the recal of the garrison Antipater immediately caused the son of Demades to be slain in his father's presence and the moment he had expired the father himself underwent the same fate  Antipater did not long survive this incident He had how attained to a great age and the anxiety of his mind cooperating with an enfeebled and declining habit of body at last produced a violent disease that soon left him but little room to hope for a recovery His end was not unworthy of the high character he had maintained through life Preferring as he had always done the interest of the nation at large to that of his own family he contented himself with appointing his son Cassander to be merely a chiliarch or commander of a thousand men while he left the goverment of Macedon and Greece to Polyperchon the eldest of Alexander's captains at that time in Europe This noble and disinterested act raised him still higher if possible in the opinion of his countrymen and made them consider his death which happened soon after not only as a national but almost as an irreparable loss  CHAP XVI TRANSACTIONS IN ASIA FROM THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER TO THE DEATH OF ANTIGONUS  THE expression which Alexander made use of on his deathbed of leaving his empire  "To the most worthy"  would probably have produced a war among his principal officers each of whom thought himself the most deserving had it not been that happily for the country the ambition of every one of them was restrained by the no less ardent ambition of the rest All of them therefore being thus obliged to relinquish for themselves every pretension to the crown they placed it and that too with general consent on the head of Alexander's only brother who was named Aridaeus or more commonly Philip Aridaeus This was a prince of very weak intellects indeed he is said to have been absolutely insane and to this circumstance probably more than to his being the son of Philip did he owe his ready admission to the throne  As to Hercules the son of Alexander by Barsine his right was easily set aside as his mother was not of royal extraction A share however of the supreme power was reserved for the child with which Roxana was then big should it prove a boy and as it actually did so and was named by its mother Alexander the empire thenceforth may be said to have had two kings instead of one Indeed in a little time it might probably have had a third as Statira Alexander's other queen was then pregnant but Roxana a cruel and ambitious woman took care to obviate this inconvenience by secretly making away with Statira as she soon  after did with her sister Parysatis the widow of Hephaestion  Perdiccas to whom on his deathbed Alexander had bequeathed his royal signet and who was supposed to be his greatest favourite after the death of Hephaestion was the chief author of these and of every other public measure For though in the outward distribution of power he contented himself with the humble station of captain of the houshold troops yet was he possessed of more real influence than any other man at court or even than any of those who were appointed governors of the different provinces As to these last they were disposed of in the following manner To Antipater and Craterus was assigned the government of Macedon and of all Greece Lysimachus was set over the Chersonese and Thrace Eumenes had Paphlagonia and Cappadocia Ptolemy had Egypt and Antigonus Phrygia the greater Lycia and Pamphylia  Though none of Alexander's captains had been able to raise themselves to sovereign sway yet were they most of them by far too powerful to continue long as peaceable subjects In a little time accordingly a civil war broke out and it then appeared that there were no less than three parties in the empire One of these was headed by Perdiccas and supported by Eumenes another was headed by Ptolemy and supported by Antipater and Craterus and the third which ultimately proved the most formidable of all was raised and maintained by Antigonus alone The events produced by the violent contentions of these different parties the narrow limits to which we are confined will not allow us to relate at any length nor indeed were we to do so would the detail after all be very interesting Let it therefore suffice to lay before the reader the most material circumstances  Perdiccas marched into Egypt with a large army in order to crush the insurrection of Ptolemy but was there slain by his own soldiers Antipater likewise assembled an army and having divided it into two bodies he put one of them under the command of Craterus who had orders to watch the motions of Eumenes whilst himself with the other went over to Cilicia for the purpose of giving assistance to Ptolemy in case there should be need In his absence Eumenes seizing a favourable opportunity attacked Craterus who was not only defeated but lost his life in the action For this loss however Antipater found some consolation in being unamimously chosen protector of the kings in the room of Perdiccas This last appointment made it necessary for him to revisit Macedon and he therefore left the prosecution of the war against Eumenes to Antigonus and to his son Cassander whom he privately instructed to keep a watchful eye on the proceedings of the former as he well knew his bold and enterprizing character  Antigonus though an excellent soldier had to cope with a man who was but little if at all his inferior A battle ensued between him and Eumenes and though the latter was worsted chiefly through the treachery of his officers yet had he the address to retire with a handful of men to the castle of Nora where without any other provisions than corn salt and water he defended himself for a whole year and at last obliged the enemy to give over the siege  Antipater died soon after his return to Macedon and as we have already observed he appointed Polyperchon for his successor This was a weak and vainglorious man and he now gave a signal proof of his imprudence in recalling Olympias to Macedon from which the policy of Antipater had always kept her at a distance  On the present occasion however she did not give way to those cruel and vindictive dispositions which had formerly marked her character and which afterwards rendered her equally infamous and miserable on the contrary she discovered the greatest political sagacity and discernment By her advice umenes was appointed to the chief command in the east and was ordered to make head against Antigonus who was every day rising into a dangerous degree of power Eumenes executed this commission with great ability and even with considerable success Being much inferior to Antigonus in number of soldiers he drew over to his own party some of the most powerful officers in that general's interest and even the whole body of the Argyraspidae a set of hardy Macedonian veterans who derived their name from the silver shields which they wore and with which they had been presented by Alexander the Great on account of their extraordinary valour By these and various other means he contrived to thwart all the designs of Antigonus for the space of three years till at last the other seizing a favourable opportunity fell suddenly upon him in his winterquarters and not only discomfited his forces but took himself prisoner and instantly put him to death  Being now freed from such a formidable enemy Antigonus began to execute those ambitious projects which he had long been meditating in private but had never dared hitherto openly to avow He first advanced to Babylon of which he made himself master Seleucus the governor having fled into Egypt and thrown himself upon the protection of Ptolemy He next invaded the provinces of Coelosyria and Phoenicia which he compelled to sumbit and having built a fleet of five hundred sail in less than a twelvemonth he attacked and reduced the city of Tyre  In the mean time a league was formed between Ptolemy Lysimachus Seleucus and Cassander for checking the progress of Antigonus's arms Ptolemy advanced with a large army to Gaza where he attacked and defeated Demetrius the son of Antigonus who had been left to command in his father's absence But Demetrius soon recovered the honour he had lost by attacking in his turn one of Ptolemy's generals and giving him a complete overthrow Ptolemy however was enabled by his victory at Gaza to furnish Seleucus with a small body of forces with which he returned to Babylon and resumed the government of that city which he continued to enjoy till his death  Though not only Antigonus but even Ptolemy Lysimachus and Cassander had for some time acted as independent princes still they affected to acknowledge a kind of submission to Alexander the young king of Macedon But this was a mere pretence to blind the eyes of the people and that pretence being now no longer thought necessary they all of them threw off the mask and openly assumed a title to that sovereign power of which they were really possessed Antigonus and his son were proclaimed kings of Syria Ptolemy was declared king of Egypt Cassander king of Macedon and Lysimachus and Seleucus took the same badge of royalty in the provinces they governed  It is not to be supposed that such restless and ambitious spirits would long live in harmony and concord among themselves The Syrian kings invaded Egypt of which they hoped to make a conquest but in this they were disappointed They next turned their arms against Rhodes but though Demetrius who on account of his wonderful success in storming cities was called Poliorcetes employed against it the utmost efforts of his military skill yet was he obliged to abandon the enterprize  For this indeed he was furnished with a plausible pretext in consequence of an embassy from the Athenians entreating him to come and free them from the oppression of Cassander who was now besieging their city Demetrius readily complied with their request and not only compelled Cassander to give over the siege of Athens but even to retreat with precipitation into Macedon  By this time the power of the Syrian kings was become so formidable as to threaten the independence of all the neighbouring states and a general combination was therefore formed against them It consisted chiefly of the Macedonians Thracians and Egyptians who assembled a large body of forces amounting in the whole to about seventyfour thousand men The kings of Syria were not long in meeting them with a still superior army and a battle ensued in the neighbourhood of Ipsus a small town in Phrygia Both sides behaved with uncommon gallantry but after a fierce and obstinate struggle the Syrians were completely defeated and their king Antigonus left dead upon the spot Demetrius escaped with about nine thousand men  CHAP XVII REVOLUTIONS IN MACEDON AND GREECE FROM THE DEATH OF ANTIPATER TO THE FINAL OVERTHROW OF THE FAMILY OF PHILIP  CASSANDER as we have already observed had usurped the throne of Macedon The steps by which he attained to that high dignity it may not be improper here a little more particularly to relate Alarmed as he justly was at the conduct of Polyperchon in recalling Olympias to court and intrusting her not only with the care  of the young king but even with the direction of the public councils he began in concert with his friends to adopt such measures as appeared to be the most proper for securing themselves against the effects of that woman's resentment for he well knew that she bore an implacable hatred to the memory of his father and to all that were either descended from or had been connected with him  One of the first steps which Polyperchon took by her advice was to issue an edict abolishing throughout all the states of Greece the aristocratic form of government which Antipater had revived and restoring the democratic mode which had existed a little before it His ostensible reason for embracing this measure was the bestowing upon the people a greater degree of liberty than they then enjoyed but his real motive was the displacing those governors whom Antipater had appointed and thereby weakening the interest of Cassander The more intelligent part of the citizens easily saw through the deceit but the people in general were caught by it and clamoured loudly against all those who dared to oppose the execution of the edict and among others against the virtuous Phocion who fell a sacrifice to their prejudices on this occasion Being brought to a trial for this pretended crime he asked whether he was to be proceeded against according to the regular forms of law and being told that he was he replied  "How is that possible if no hearing is to be allowed me"  Perceiving from the violence of the popular resentment that no opportunity of defence would be granted him he exclaimed  "As for myself I confess the crime of which I am accused and submit chearfully to the sentence of the law but consider O ye Athenians what it is that these men have done that they should thus be involved in the same calamity with me"  The people called  out vehemently  "They are your accomplices and we need no farther proof of their guilt"  A decree was then drawn up and read by which Phocion and several others were condemned to death As they were leading this great man to the place of execution a friend asked him if he had any commands to leave for his son  "Only this" replied he very coolly "that he forget how ill the Athenians treated his father"  The revenge of his enemies was not satiated even with his death They passed a decree by which his body was banished the Athenian territories and a penalty was denounced against any person who should furnish fire for his funeral pile One Conopion conveyed the corpse a little beyond Eleusina where he borrowed fire of a Megarian woman and burned it A Megarian matron who attended on that occasion raised an humble monument on the spot in memory of the unfortunate orator and having carried home his ashes which she had previously collected with great care she buried them under her hearth putting up at the same time this prayer to her houshold gods  "To you O ye deities who protect this place do I commit the precious remains of the most excellent Phocion protect them I beseech you from every insult and deliver them one day to be deposited in the sepulchre of his ancestors when the Athenians shall have become wiser"  A short time only had intervened when the prayer of the pious matron was fulfilled The Athenians as in former instances of a similar kind began to abate of their fury and to have their eyes opened to the truth They recollected the many services which the state had derived from the superior wisdom of Phocion's counsels and on that recollection they could not but wonder at the part they had acted They decreed for the victim of  their rage a statue of brass they ordered his ashes to be brought back to Athens at the public expence and passed an act by which all his accusers were to be put to death Agnonides who had a capital hand in carrying on the prosecution against Phocion was seized and executed Epicurus and Demophilus fled but Phocion's son overtook them and revenged the death of his father  Polyperchon having thus freed himself from so powerful an opponent as Phocion proceeded to execute his decree with unrelenting severity and whoever dared to thwart his will in this particular was instantly condemned to death Olympias too now thinking she might gratify her revenge without controul and without the fear of future retribution began to wreak her resentment upon all those who were either the objects of her jealously or hatred King Aridaeus the son of Philip by a concubine naturally fell under this predicament She had already deprived him of his understanding by means of a potion she had given him and she now had the cruelty to deprive him of his life and even to inflict the same punishment on his queen Eurydice who was likewise his niece and granddaughter to Philip She had indeed some shadow of reason for proceeding to such extremities against them They had not only disapproved of her return to Macedon but even raised an army to prevent it but being deserted by their troops they were both taken prisoners and put in confinement Aridaeus was soon after murdered in prison by a party of Thracians whom Olympias sent thither for the purpose and in a little time she dispatched a messenger to the queen with a poniard a rope and a cup of poison desiring her to chuse which she pleased This message Eurydice received with the greatest composure and after praying the gods  "that Olympias herself might be rewarded with  the like presents"  she took the rope and strangled herself Cynane her mother had some time before been cut off by the arts of the same vindictive woman  Olympias's thirst of blood seems not to have been quenched by the numerous murders she had committed She now caused Nicanor the brother of Cassander to be put to death The body of Iolas another brother of Cassander's which had long rested in the tomb she ordered to be brought forth and exposed on the highway and an hundred Macedonians of noble birth were seized and executed on suspicion of having been in the interest of Cassander She had indeed great reason to hate or at least to dread that illustrious commander but had she been as cunning as she was cruel she would have endeavoured to soften rather than inflame his resentment  Cassander sensible of his utter inability to make head against her and Polyperchon by any force he could raise in Europe had applied for assistance to Antigonus in Asia and having received a small supply of men from that quarter he returned with them to Athens where he was gladly received by Nicanor the governor who had opposed the execution of Polyperchon's decree with great zeal and activity Their forces being thus joined gained several advantages over those of Polypherchon and Olympias they defeated their fleet near Byzantium and they rendered all their enterprizes by land perfectly ineffectual  Cassander however with all his good qualitites seems to have been as much transported with the lust of power as any of the other great men of the age and to this he was always ready to sacrifice every tie of justice of honour and of gratitude Hearing that Nicanor was beginning to form a separate interest of his own and aimed at no less  than the sovereignty of Attica he contrived to draw him under pretence of an interview into an empty house where he had him murdered by some assassins he had prepared for the purpose  For this barbarous act indeed he made the best amends in his power by appointing for his successor a man of a most excellent character This was no other than Demetrius Phalereus the celebrated disciple of Theophrastus Demetrius was at once a philosopher an orator and a man of virtue Cicero makes mention of his oratory in a very favourable manner but then he says he was the first of all the Greeks who changed the bold nervous and resistless eloquence of the earlier orators into the mild and pathetic species of eloquence which he thinks is as much inferior in point of merit to the former  "as the power of the gentlygliding stream is inferior to that of the rough thundering torrent"  Demetrius however executed his important trust with so much justice and equity and with such an invariable attention to the happiness of the people he governed that the Athenians erected no less than three hundred statues to his honour and many of these were equestrian  Matters were now tending fast towards a crisis between Cassander on the one hand and Polyperchon and Olympias on the other Cassander having divided his army into two bodies gave the command of the one to Callas with orders to march against Polyperchon whose troops had been separated from those of Olympias With the other he himself set out in pursuit of that woman who after trying various arts to stir up the Macedonians in her favour was at last obliged to take refuge in the city of Pydna which was strongly fortified There she was immediately besieged by Cassander who reduced her at length to such difficulties for want of provisions that she  was forced to surrender both herself and her army In taking this mortifying step however she had the precaution to stipulate for her life but the kindred of those whom she had murdered insisting on her death Cassander pretended that the stipulation related only to military execution and he therefore gave her up to the civil laws of her country The friends of those whom she had slain assembled and accused her before the people by whom she was condemned without being heard On this occasion Cassander offered her a ship to convey her to Athens but she rejected the offer She insisted upon being heard before the Macedonians and said she was not afraid to answer for all she had done Cassander was unwilling to abide the issue of such a trial as she demanded he therefore sent a band of two hundred soldiers to put her to death When the soldiers entered the prison they were struck with awe at her majestic appearance and refused to execute their orders but the relations of those who had fallen by her resentment rushed forward and cut her throat She is said to have behaved with much fortitude on that trying occasion Cassander suffered her body to lie for some time unburied to revenge perhaps the insult which she had offered to the remains of his brother Iolas Roxana and her son as we have already observed were soon after murdered and the same was the fate of Hercules Alexander's other son whom he had by Barsine  Not more than twentyeight years had elapsed since the death of that conqueror and not a single branch of his house remained to enjoy a portion of the empire which he and his father had acquired at the price of the greatest policy dangers and bloodshed Such to the royal family of Macedon were the effects of that ambition which had lighted up the flames of war in Europe Asia and Africa  CHAP XVIII REVOLUTIONS IN MACEDON AND GREECE FROM THE OVERTHROW OF THE FAMILY OF PHILIP TO THE CONFEDERACY FORMED BY THE MACEDONIANS AND ACHAEANS AGAINST THE AETCLIANS  THOUGH Cassander had now established himself on the throne of Macedon he did not enjoy all that tranquillity which he thought he had reason to expect He found that Polyperchon and his son Alexander were forming a party against him in Greece and therefore in order to counteract their designs he marched into Boeotia where he not only defeated all their machinations but likewise rebuilt the city of Thebes about twenty years after it had been destroyed by Alexander the Great This transaction he did not long survive He died in a little time after leaving behind him two sons Antipater and Alexander who as usually happens in such cases soon began to quarrel about their respective right to the throne and the latter calling in the aid of Demetrius Poliorcetes this last contrived to make away with the man he pretended to assist and himself got possession of the sovereign power Of this however he was soon deprived by the joint efforts of Lysimachus and Pyrrhus king of Epire the former of whom partly by open force and partly by secret artifices found means to make himself sole king of Macedon But neither did he enjoy his newly acquired power for any length of time his army being routed and himself slain in a great battle which he fought with Seleucus king of Babylon Seleucus upon this victory▪ resigned his Asiatic dominions to his  son Antiochus and came over to Macedon in the fond hope of passing the remainder of his days in the quiet enjoyment of his native country But he was treacherously murdered about seven months after by Ptolemy Ceraunus  The Thunderer  the brother of Cassander who to add to his guilt prevailed upon the widow of Lysimachus to marry him but he had no sooner got her and her children into his power than he put the young princes to death and banished the mother into Samothrace  Crimes so atrocious did not long go unpunished His kingdom for he had now seized on the throne of Macedon was soon overrun by a body of Gauls who suddenly attacked and defeated her forces and having cut off the head of the king himself they fixed it to the end of a long pole and thus carried it in triumph through their ranks  The progress however of these barbarians was at last put a stop to by the united states of Greece They several times attempted to force the straits of Thermopylae but were always repulsed with considerable loss At length they found a passage into the interior parts of Greece by the way of mount Oeta and directed their march towards the temple of Delphi which they intended to plunder But the inhabitants of that sacred city inspired by religious enthusiasm made a desperate sally upon the barbarians who struck with a panic fled with precipitation The pursuit was continued for a whole day and night and a violent storm and piercing cold cooperating with the fury of the victorious Greeks most of the enemy perished either by the sword or the severity of the weather Brennus their leader unable to bear the smart of the wounds he had received and distracted at the same time with religious horror put an end to his own life The few that survived having assembled together  endeavoured to effect a retreat from so fatal a country But the different nations rose upon them as they passed and of all those multitudes which had poured out of Macedon into Greece not one returned to his native land Justin says they were all cut off though other historians alledge that a remnant of them made their escape into Thrace and Asia  The Delphians did not depend entirely on their courage in repelling the barbarians they employed two very ingenious and successful stratagems against them They procured an order from the oracle commanding the inhabitants of the adjacent villages to abandon their dwellings and to leave them well stored with wines and all kinds of provisions The consequence was that the Gauls who like all other barbarians were naturally voracious and had their appetites sharpened by a long want of sustenance fell ravenously upon these dainties and thus through intemperance lost much of that vigour which had hitherto been the principal cause of the success of their arms The other stratagem was this mount Parnassus which stood close by the city of Delphos was furnished with many caves and hollow windings In these numbers of people were stationed with instructions on proper occasions to set up loud shouts and to make the most frightful yellings and screams These issuing forth without any visible cause filled the barbarians with terror as if they proceeded from something more than human and therefore believing they were warring with superior beings not with men they betook themselves to a precipitate retreat even almost before they were attacked This body of Gauls formed only a part of that immense shoal which to the number it is said of no less than three hundred thousand poured out of their own country in quest of new settlements and though they were defeated and cut off in Greece  yet they had the courage to take and plunder Rome  The Macedonian throne after the death of Ptolemy Ceraunus was filled by Antigonus the son of Demetrius Poliorcetes he was deposed and succeeded Pyrrhus king of Epire but upon the death of this last prince Antigonus once more assumed the sovereign sway Nothing remarkable happened during the reign of either of these kings except that Pyrrhus the most warlike prince of his time and in the opinion of Hannibal the greatest general that ever lived made an attempt upon the liberty of Sparta and advancing to the gates of the city with a powerful army the inhabitants were struck with so much terror that they proposed sending off their women to a place of safety But Archidamia who was delegated by the Spartan ladies entered the senatehouse with a sword in her hand and delivered their sentiments and her own in these words  "Think not O men of Sparta so meanly of your countrywomen as to imagine that we will survive the ruin of the state Deliberate not then whither we are to fly but what we are to do"  In consequence of this the whole body of citizens exerted themselves with such undaunted courage that they repulsed Pyrrhus in all his attempts to destroy the city They even pursued him in his retreat and slew Ptolemy his son who was bringing up the rear of his army Pyrrhus himself soon after perished in a like attempt upon Argos  Antigonus upon his reascending the throne defeated a body of Gauls who had made a fresh irruption into Macedon and encouraged by this success he began to entertain thoughts of making himself absolute master of Greece He even proceeded so far as to compel the Athenians to receive a Macedonian garrison and he would probably  have imposed the same badge of slavery on the other states of Greece had not death put an end to all his ambitious projects He was succeeded by his son Demetrius and this last by his kinsman Antigonus neither of whose reigns were distinguished by any remarkable events  About this time the republic of Achaia began to make a capital figure and bade fair for restoring that spirit of liberty in Greece which had in a great measure been extinguished partly by the dissensions of the different states among themselves but chiefly by the encroachments of the Macedonian monarchs This republic consisted originally of twelve towns that were associated together for their mutual defence They had the same friendships and the same enmities the same coins weights and measures the same laws and the same magistrates These magistrates were elected annually by a majority of voices throughout the whole community Twice in the year or oftener if necessary a general assembly consisting of deputies from the different cities was held for the great purposes of legislation and government The magistrates who were invested with the supreme executive power were styled generals of the states of Achaia They commanded the military force of the republic and possessed the right of presiding in the national assembly Their number was originally two but from the inconveniencies attendant on a divided government was at last reduced to one A council of ten called Demiurgi assisted the general with their advice and examined all matters intended to be brought before the national assembly and proposed or rejected them at pleasure The power of the Demiurgi in this last respect was exactly the same as that of the lords of articles in the ancient government of Scotland Besides these superior magistrates every town had also its municipal magistracy  consisting also as is generally supposed like the national constitution of a popular assembly a council and a presiding magistrate With respect to the laws of the Achaeans the most material object in the history of any people our knowledge is extremely imperfect Such of them however as have come down to us are proofs of their political wisdom  It was enacted that whatever individual or town belonging to the Achaean confederacy should accept of any gratification whatsoever in its public or private capacity from prince or people should be cut off from the commonwealth of Achaia that no member of the Achaean league should send any embassy or contract any alliance or friendship with any prince or people without the privity and approbation of the whole Achaean confederacy The unanimous consent of the whole confederacy was necessary for the admission into it of any prince state or city A convention of the national assembly was not to be granted at the request of any foreign prince unless the matters to be offered to their consideration were first delivered in writing to the general of Achaia and the council of ten and pronounced by them to be of sufficient importance The deliberations of every assembly were to be wholly confined to the matters on account of which they had been convened In all debates those who spoke were to deliver a short sketch of the arguments they employed in order to their being considered the ensuing day and within three days at farthest was the business before them to be finally determined  The general tendency of the Achaean league was so favourable to the liberties of mankind that most of the neighbouring states associated themselves with it but when the power of Macedon became paramount to that of all Greece many of the members  deserted the confederacy and fell under the dominion of various tyrants From this state of slavery however they were in a little time freed by the spirit and activity of Aratus a native of Sicyon who having first delivered his own country from the tyranny of Nicocles its sovereign and being in consequence of this chosen general of Achaia proceeded to attack one petty tyrant after another till at last he reestablished all the states of Greece in the possession of their ancient freedom But this happy situation of affairs was not of long continuance it was soon overturned by the jealousy and ambition of those very parties from whose love of liberty it had originally sprung  CHAP XIX FROM THE CONFEDERACY BETWEEN THE AETOLIANS AND SPARTANS AGAINST THE ACHAEANS TO THE INVASION OF GREECE BY ANTIOCHUS KING OF SYRIA  THE Aetolians were the first that began to look with a jealous eye on the superiority of the Achaeans over the other states of Greece and they laboured and that with but too much success to infuse the like prejudices into the Spartans The manners of this last people were now totally altered They had exchanged poverty and hardy discipline for opulence and a luxurious stile of living The lands which were formerly divided in equal portions among the whole body of the people were now engrossed by a few families who lived in the greatest splendour and magnificence while the rest of the citizens were plunged in the utmost poverty and distress Agis one of their most virtuous  kings was put to death for attempting to restore the agrarian and sumptuary laws of Lycurgus Cleomenes however his successor was more fortunate He actually did restore these laws though not till he had acquired sufficient popularity to set all opposition at defiance This popularity he owed chiefly to the success of his arms against the Achaeans and their allies several of whose towns he attacked and subdued and he even defeated their army in two pitched battles the one at Leuctra and the other at Hecatombaeum  Aratus provoked at the conduct of Cleomenes in thus making war upon the Achaeans without any visible cause threw himself on the protection of Antigonus king of Macedon and in order to induce him to grant the aid he requested he entered into a compact with that monarch the conditions of which were That the citadel of Corinth should be delivered into the hands of the king that he should be at the head of the Achaean confederacy superintend their councils and direct their operations that his army should be supported at their expence that neither embassy nor letter should be sent to any power without his approbation and that no city state or people should be from that time admitted into the Achaean league without his consent From these articles it is evident that the liberties of Achaia were now no more and that the real sovereign of that country was Antigonus  The conduct of Aratus in making this treaty was more unpopular than that of Cleomenes in attacking the Achaeans the consequence was that most of the states of Greece abandoned the cause of the former and espoused that of the latter whom they now considered as the only protector of their liberties But Antigonus besides being an excellent general was possessed of greater resources than any Cleomenes could command and thus having  contrived after various manoeuvres to bring him to an engagement he not only gave him a complete overthrow but compelled him to fly into Egypt where being suspected of forming designs against the government he was cruelly put to death  Antigonus himself died soon after and was succeeded by Philip the son of Demetrius the last of the Macedonian kings of that name This prince treading in the steps of his predecessor resolved to give effectual aid to the Achaeans which he accordingly did by carrying the war into Aetolia itself and reducing a great number of its strong holds Though naturally possessed of great moderation he now began to entertain the hope of making himself master of all Greece by forming a junction with Hannibal who was then carrying on war against the Romans He sent ambassadors to the Carthaginian general and a treaty was concluded between them importing that Philip should furnish a fleet and army to assist Hannibal in making a conquest of Italy after which Hannibal should pass into Epire and having completed the reduction of the whole country should yield up to Philip such places as lay convenient for Macedon Philip performed his part of the agreement He entered the Ionian gulf with a large fleet and took Oricum a seaport on the coast of Epire but being surprized and defeated by the Romans he was obliged to return disgracefully into his own country  The Romans had their hands too full of the war with Hannibal to think of carrying their arms into Macedon but they took care to find employment for Philip by encouraging his enemies in Greece to attack him For this purpose they entered into a treaty with the Aetolians of which the following were the principal conditions That the Aetolians should immediately commence hostilities against  Philip by land which the Romans were to support by a fleet of twenty gallies that whatever conquests might be made from the confines of Aetolia to Corcyra the cities buildings and territory should belong to the Aetolians but every other kind of plunder to the Romans The Spartans and Eleans with other states were included in this alliance and the war commenced with the reduction of the island of Zacynthus which as an earnest of Roman generosity and good faith was immediately annexed to the dominions of Aetolia These things happened about two hundred and eight years before the birth of Christ  The Romans having thus obtained a footing in Greece soon extended and established their power throughout the whole of that renowned country Agreeably to their usual policy they availed themselves of the credulity the dissensions the ambition and the avarice of the different chiefs ever vigilant to support the weaker against the stronger party that the diminished strength of each individual state might lead the way to the conquest of the whole  Mean while the war continued to be carried on between Philip and the Aetolians with equal vigour and almost with equal success on both sides till at last the former was obliged to return into his own kingdom to suppress a rebellion which had there broke out The Achaeans however though deprived of the aid of so powerful a monarch were still able to make head against their enemies They were now commanded by Philopaemen in the room of Aratus whom Philip had poisoned on account of his opposing the ambitious design which the latter had formed of subduing all Greece They even defeated the armies of Aetolia and Elis in a great battle but after the war had continued for the space of six years it was at length terminated by a  peace between the Romans on the one hand and Philip on the other  This peace however was but of short duration For Philip having invaded the dominions of the king of Egypt as also the territories of several of the states of Greece complaints were brought against him on that account before the Roman senate who immediately dispatched an ambassador to him strictly charging him in the name of the republic to desist from all hostilities against those powers and to refer the matters in dispute between him and them to a fair arbitration Marcus Aemilius who carried this order delivered it with all that dignity and firmness which distinguished the Roman character  "The boastful inexperience of youth" said the king to him "thy gracefulness of person and still more the name of Roman inspire thee with this haughtiness It is my wish that Rome may observe the faith of treaties but should she be inclined again to hazard an appeal to arms I trust that with the protection of the gods I shall render the Macedonian name as formidable as that of the Roman"  These events happened about one hundred and ninetynine years before the birth of Christ  Philip soon found that the stile of the Roman ambassadors was not more imperious than their power was irresistible for Titus Quintus Flaminius being appointed to command against him reduced him in a little time to the hard necessity of accepting a peace on the following conditions  "That all the Greek cities both in Asia and Europe should be free and restored to the enjoyment of their own laws that Philip before the next Isthmian games should deliver up to the Romans all the Greeks he had in any part of his dominions and evacuate all the places he possessed either in Greece or in Asia that he should give up all prisoners and deserters that he should surrender all  his decked ships of every kind five small vessels and his own galley of sixteen banks of oars excepted that he should pay the Romans a thousand talents one half down and the rest at ten equal annual payments and that as a security for the performance of these article he should gives hostages his son Demetrius being one  This event happened an hundred and ninetythree years before Christ  CHAP XX FROM THE INVASION OF GREECE BY ANTIOCHUS TO THE TIME OF ITS BECOMING A ROMAN PROVINCE  THOUGH the Romans by their treaty with Philip pretended to reestablish the Greeks in the possession of their ancient freedom yet nothing was farther from their intention On the contrary they meant to reduce them under their own dominion The question was not whether the Greeks should be enslaved but who should be their masters and the Romans thought and it must be owned with some shadow of justice that there was no people in the world better intitled to such a distinction than themselves They therefore sought for a plausible pretext of carrying their arms a second time into Greece and it was not long before this was afforded them by Antiochus king of Syria For that prince having invaded Greece under pretence of supporting his own rights was opposed by the Romans on the specious plea of defending the public liberty and who not only defeated his forces but compelled him to retire into his Asiatic dominions The Aetolians too though they formerly cooperated with the Romans as allies could not think of enduring them as masters and they  therefore endeavoured to thwart their design of usurping the sovereignty of the Grecian republics but the consul Acilius Glabrio soon reduced their power to so low an ebb that they were glad to accept of a peace upon any terms and even virtually to give up their independence by promising to pay observance to the empire and majesty of the Roman people  The efforts of the Achaeans to prevent the establishment of the Roman empire in Greece were not more successful Above a thousand of their leading men were transported to Rome in order to answer for the pretended crime of having secretly abetted the king of Macedon who had had the courage or temerity to oppose the Romans in the field But that prince whose name was Perseus and who was son and successor to Philip was not only defeated in a great battle but being taken prisoner was carried to Rome and thrown into a dungeon where he starved himself to death His only surviving son Alexander became a clerk to one of the Roman magistrates Macedon was immediately formed into a Roman province as were likewise in a little time after all the different states of Greece These things fell out about an hundred and sixtythree years before the birth of Christ  From this time forward few events of any great consequence happened in Greece and those that occurred belong more properly to Roman than to Grecian history We shall therefore pursue them no farther at present but conclude with observing that depressed as the Greeks now unhappily were under a foreign yoke and consequently deprived of their national character as a free and independent people they yet retained amidst all their calamities that strength of genius and delicacy of taste that quickness of invention and acuteness of discernment for which they had ever been remarkable that they  helped to polish their haughty and as yet but halfcivilized conquerors that upon the destruction of the western empire they successfully cultivated the arts and sciences while all the rest of the world was sunk in the grossest ignorance and barbarism and that upon the taking of Constantinople by the Turks they carried those arts and sciences with them into Italy and there paved the way for the revival of that learning which has ever since enlightened and still continues to enlighten mankind  FINIS  Books printed for G G J and J Robinson Paternosterrow  I THE
