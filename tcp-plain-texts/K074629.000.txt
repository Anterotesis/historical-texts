 THE LAND OF THE MUSES A POEM In the Manner of SPENSER  WITH POEMS on several Occasions  By HUGH DOWNMAN AB  EDINBURGH Printed for the AUTHOR Sold by A KINCAID J BELL  Edinburgh  and by R BALDWIN and RICHARDSON URQUHART  London  MDCCLXVIII  THE LAND OF THE MUSES A POEM In the Manner of SPENSER  TO Dr THOMAS BLACKLOCK  TO thee to whom the equal hand of Heaven  Though it depriv'd thee of external sight  The better graces of the mind has given  Genius and Learning's thews and Judgement's light  And Fortitude mid undeserved ills  And wideembracing Liberality  Each thought humane which the sweet bosom fills  And decks the form of saintly Charity  These rhymes all roughly woven do I bear  Which  thee alone t' amuse  first framed were  Flattery pursues the  great  when thee I praise  Who nought but thy good spirit hast t'impart  While Truth approves deny not of my lays  The guerdon thy esteem and friendly heart  PREFACE  IF the author should say he did not heartily approve of compositions of this kind or admire the construction of the stanza or think the more highly of any person for clothing his thoughts in the phraseology of Spenser it might be asked what induced him to write the following poem and how he came to lay it before the public As to the first question it owes its birth to accident alone As to the second he frankly owns that he flattered himself some merit would be found in it independent of the uncouth manner and antiquated dress in which it was to appear and this only he is sensible can justify the publication of it to a reader of taste and discernment  It may be proper perhaps just to mention the prior part of the fable of which this is to be supposed a consequence In the th Canto of the d Book of the Fairy Queen  Guyon  and  Arthur  journeying together arrive at the castle of  Alma  which they find besieged by  Malaeger  and his crew whom they engage and put to the rout They are courteously received by  Alma  who shews them her castle In the chamber of  Memory  they find two books one called  The Briton Moniments  the other  The Antiquity of Fairy Lond  an account of these  takes up the th Canto In the th  Guyon  departs on his adventures against the  Bower of Bliss  upon which the enemies of  Alma  being emboldened return to the siege  Arthur  sallies out against them and after a severe engagement overcomes their chief by squeezing him to death His squire brings him back to the castle covered with wounds  Where many grooms and squires ready were  To take him from his steed full tenderly  And eke the fairest Alma met him there  With balm and wine and costly spicerie  To comfort him in his infirmitie  Eftsoons she caus'd him up to be convey'd  And of his arms despoiled easily  In sumptuous bed she made him to be laid  And all the while his wounds were dressing by him staid  The Land of the MUSES A POEM In the Manner of SPENSER  As if to be inserted in the d Book of the FAIRY QUEEN between the th and th Cantos  ARGUMENT  The  Prince  nigh cur'd of mortal stowers  Alma  to entertain  Shows him  Dan Phoebus'  magick bowers  Where the  Nine Ladies  reign  I  FOOLS they who vainly ween that  Temperaunce  Her joyous sweet amenities denies  To human kind or looks with sight ascaunce  Whan they with liberal delights devise  Their ears to feed or gratify their eyes  Nothing she bids witholden that behoves  Him to ensue who nould be dempt unwise  All sports and rational pleasaunce she loves  But hateth idle  Lust  who ay at random roves  II  When as the  Prince  by fairest  Alma  's care  Was nigh recured of his woundez sore  Which he in hardy conflict had whilee'er  Endur'd as gainst thilke felon arms he bare  But him subdued withouten sword or spear  As prudent Leaches all in this agree  That mind and body are conjoined near  Ne one without the other can be free  She bent her thought to keep his mind in goodly gree  III  So seated by his side unto his ear  She framed her discourse in words most meet  At times of chevisaunce and warlike geer  And warrior knights who underneath their feet  Did trample death immortal fame to greet  Tho sagely would she change her talk and ply  His list'ning sense with speech so honey'd sweet  And moral thews of wise philosophy  That he was rapt and inly ravished thereby  IV  And ever and anon wou'd  PraiseDesire  Open her rubin lips and featly sing  Her pensive notes but such as mought inspire  Calm moods of tranquil stedfastness and bring  To truest test and justest tempering  Ye would have sworn one of the heav'nly throng  Was slid to earth upon melodious wing  Sich silver sounds weft the mild air along  And sich the blandishment of her slowditted song  V  And eke  Shamesacedness  with mellow lute  Her strains harmonious accompanied  For she her instrument full well could suit  New wanted in welldoing comely pride  The Prince his secret pleasure ne mought hide  But smit with love of glorious emprise  Felt his spright mov'd past utterance and figh'd  The living fire flasht from his gazing eyes  And drench'd in bliss unknown to vulgar soul he lies  VI  It chaunced out one evening as these four  Did walk by thilke same river's winding side  From whence Sir  Guyon  launch'd which there did pour  His bounteous stream watering the country wide  The  Prince  the coast which them opposed spied  Woods and fair hills in beautiful array  And lawns which now the setting Phoebus eyed  Beaming the last remains of golden day  He saw and ask'd what land that was which yonder lay  VII  That is the land the gentlest  Alma  said  In which  Apollo  and the  Muses  dwell  On which their blessings with great bountihed  They cast abroad there by the living well  Of  Hippocrene  they fix their happy sell  There wonne at distaunce from the profane world  With whose assairs they never mind to mell  Als  Jovisaunce  is there with face unfurl'd  And care and grief and carking pain far off are hurl'd  VIII  And thousand dainty shapes inhabit there  And unimagin'd forms by common mind  To every single one of which a peer  In other place on earth may no man find  Of purest nature and aethereal kind  By the three  Graces  seemingly bedight  For in that realm their girdes the  Graces  bind  And  Liberty  ay sporteth in their sight  And there the  Virtues  stray yrob'd in stoles of white  IX  How may said then the  Prince  a straunger gain  Thilke place which thou descriven hast to see  Perdy most rarely brave is that domain  Ne speak I out of vaunting susquedry  And losty vain conceit yet is in me  A heart in which good nurture fix'd the thew  And love of seemly liberality  Not as a faytour false or spy I sue  These Bonnibels and fair depeinten Imps to view  X  To me O Briton Prince she said is given    Alma  then smil'd and smil'd those other twain  Free enteraunce into that earthly heav'n  By young Apollo's self who there doth reign  Als he to me hath ordered to restrain  And keepen back by force the rascal rout  Of noisy  Riotise  his drunken train  But never the ingenuous mind to flout  Ne wight of fair demeanour ever shutten out  XI  But now is well nigh time hence to be gone  And supper ended take ourselves to rest  Now wakeful man wends by himself alone  For bird and beast by  Somnus  are yblest  All but the beast of prey which is addrest  To cruel slaughter on the helpless crew  And Philomela who with woe imprest  Her dolorous fate wails in sad measure due  But softer than descent of night's fastfalling dew  XII  Early the morn we will forth yede yfere  And in a gondelay to yonder shore  Across the intervening ferry steer  There on the many delices to pore  Of which 'twere tedious to recount the store  Thanks render'd tho the Prince in manner'd wise  For he was skill'd in every courtly lore  That night did sleep seant close his wakeful eyes  And in the morn he rose with the bright sun's uprise  XIII  Alma  prepared he already found  For never she indulg'd in slothful bed  But when the lark soar'd upward from the ground  She ay wou'd bid adieu to drowsihed  Tho forth they issued from that goodly sted  And in due season to the ferry came  Fast by its brink the gondelay moored  They see and eke the wight who steer'd the same  Of most welllooked mien  GoodCulture  was his name  XIV  The  Knight  and  Lady  he with joy on board  Did take then pushed with strong arm away  And launch'd the vessel far into the ford  Tho he his painted canvas did display  While kind gales in its swelling bosom play  With speed they cut the stream as chrystal clear  Or as the brighteyed Titan's piercing ray  For not the smallest stain of spot was there  But tho' the waves were deep the bottom did appear  XV  When as they did that shore approachen near  Girt with the cestus of eternal spring  Its evervirid banks th' ambrosial air  Odours most exquisitely sweet did bring  For  Zephyrus  there ever fann'd his wing  And there did  Flora  plentifully strew  The ground with flowers which fragrance round them fling  Sweetscented flowers of every various hue  That whilom in  Adonis'  happy gardens grew  XVI  How bin they landed in that pleasaunt place  And now along the lilied shore proceed  Far as their eyne the widestretch'd coast can trace  The blithsome scenery they in silence read  The  Prince  in wonder lost gave fixed heed  At every turn at every turn amaze  Sat on his cheek delightsome awe and dreed  Well might that prospect frailer wight have daz'd  He gaz'd and thought that there he could for ay have gaz'd  XVII  His fair conductress bade him cast his eyes  To waken him from out his rapturous traunce  To where before the path they took crosswise  Over a velvet meadow did advaunce  Two beings of most pleasing amenaunce  Upon their foreheads gayety did sit  Their joyous girlonds in the wind did daunce  Their cheeks were blooming red their feet were flit  And treading the soft turf did leave no print on it  XVIII  The one yclep'd was  Youth  the down began  His features to aguise with decent pride  Ne mought he older wax ne grow to man  Yet was that other giv'n him for his bride  Of whom he got a son who by his side  Renning in merry mood for ay did smile  Hygeia  did his spouse the name betide  With her he took no note of time the while  It passed by so well each hour she could beguile  XIX  That tender Imp he guided by the hand  With face speaking his heart so airy light  He hath benempt  Content  tho' he be scann'd  A boy great power dwelleth with that wight  For whomsoe'er he looketh on his spright  Is with complacence fill'd and jocund glee  An infant babe  Simplicity  behight  The mother bore of lovely hue to see  Stretching his little arms and telling his cale free  XX  Them  Alma  gracefully ybording said  Tell me ye gentle pair if ye have seen  Where widely your enchaunted feet have stray'd  Emong the mazes of this flowery green  Where  Fancy  wonneth now for well I ween  She hath no certain bidingplace of rest  But now the shade she seeketh now the sheen  Now flitteth north now south now east now west  All pleasure she doth love variety the best  XXI  To her with count'nance blithe did  Youth  reply  The words from his quick tongue ydropping fast  If  Fancy  you do seek fair dame perdy  In yonder glen with high rocks overcast  From whence a tumbling torrent froth hath brast  I saw her even now so louting low  He with his bellamour away did haste  Right onward  Alma  and the Prince did go  Then why she  Fancy  sought he fain of her would know  XXII  Without her aid O  Prince  said  Alma  fair  To travel thro' this coast were endless stower  Ne without her direction would I dare  Convoy thee as behoves a single hour  Besides she builded hath a wond'rous tow'r  Which hence thou seest high in the air ypight  From whence is view'd distinctly dell and bower  And rock and stream and every living wight  And every goodly thing with which these realms are dight  XXIII  Unto the which if thee she will convey  In portion small of time she can unfold  What else would take up many a weary day  And many a sleepless night for to behold  Ne ever so at last you prosper would  But after muchell labour and sojourn  Some forest dark your wilder'd feet would hold  Or ye would sink crossing some roaring bourn  Or to the whence ye came ye idly would return  XXIV  Soon mought they now behold that  Maid divine  Upon a craggy cliff she took her stand  Above her head spread a broad branching pine  Which sent a dark shade round on either hand  Down many a thousand yarde of rising land  From rock to rock a strong stream forc'd its way  Which there was blent in one accoiled band  She joyant stood over the foaming bay  And bath'd her forehead in the floating dewy spray  XXV  When as the tread of stranger feet she heard  Eftsoons her eyes she thitherwards enhaunc'd  Which as the glitterand sunbeam bright appear'd  And quicker than the quivering levin glaunc'd  And strait toward them with light step advaunc'd  Her goldentendrill'd locks down from her head  Hung loosely wav'ring as to them bechaunc'd  She never them confin'd in tye or brede  But they most comely seem'd whan most dishevelled  XXVI  In thin habiliment she was bedight  Of cunningly inwoven goss'mer twin'd  Most curious was that garment to the sight  And on the lap of the soft dalliaunt wind  Which it sustain'd disported far behind  Its colour was of every various dye  Which in the glorious bow of heaven we find  And every intermingled shade the eye  Could ever ken was there in vast complexity  XXVII  In that retired vale oftimes she sate  Where  Nature  strayed wild by  Art  not found  But not therein immewed was her state  Nor yet ypent in any fixed bound  Free and at large she raung'd creation round  Or breaking thro the brazen gyre would steer  Her flight with cheek not blanch'd nor heart astound  The din of  Chaos  and  Confusion  hear  Ne all the everbickering elements would fear  XXVIII  There if she will'd new worldes of her own  She would create and them impeople too  And in the midst upbuild her splendent throne  Exacting from her subjects homage due  Tho in a moment's space these worldes new  And each thing in them would annihilate  Her pregnant will she ever would pursue  For she alone most wond'rous to relate  Except highreigning  God  was uncontroul'd by fate  XXIX  Oft to the heav'n of heav'ns she would ascend  And thro th' impenetrable blaze would try  Boldly her peering vision to extend  And into the mysterious Godhead pry  Where far above the staryflaming sky  His seat is circled deep with glory bright  " In his trinal triplicity on high"  But never could she pass that lustrous light  Highreigning  God  alone escap'd her thrillant sight  XXX  Yet sich her sway that she to earth could bring  From their eternal steds  Angelic Quires  Who round about her gently hovering  Tun'd at her will their goldenstringed lyres  Or maugre dernful  Pluto's  grisly fires  Would cleave the earth and rowse to upper air  The  Furies  with their whips of iron wires  And snakes loud hissing in their troubled hair  And  Hecate  at her call would her dread front uprear  XXXI  With them all ills would rise that shun the light  Sternlook'd  Revenge Hate  by wild frenzy torn  And each abhorred child of ugly  Night  Lust  ever restless  Jealousy  o'erworn  Mean  Murder  of each generous mind the scorn  And pining  Care  which in her sickly plume  Inshrouds while yet alive the wretch forlorn  And  Woe  whose heart by inches does consume  Hanging with face all pale o'er her dead lovers tomb  XXXII  And she would call th' unbodied  Ghosts  around  With shrieking note utt'ring their dolorous wail  And  Witchcraft  mumbling forth her rites profound  Might make the stoutest living wight to quail  And conscious  Fear  who secretly doth steal  Keeping close watch beside the murderer's bed  And when  Sleep  gins his tired lids to veil  And wrap the poppied purfle o'er his head  Rings her alarum wild and rends his soul with dread  XXXIII  Yet nothing was there fearful in her face  Or terrible to the beholders view  But in her was an amiable grace  A lovely and a modest blushing hue  Which mingled with respect love's passion drew  And winning smiles her features freed from scorn  And ye might read her straying veins quite through  Her alabaster skin and so adorn  She looked like the eldest daughter of the  Morn  XXXIV  Now she the gentlest  Alma  first addrest  Welcome fair virgin to these blissful bowers  Then tenderly did clasp her to her breast  And hail to thee  Sir Knight  can aught the pow'rs  Who here inherit aught the winged  Hours  The  Graces  and the  Virtues  thee to please  For thee to please belov'd of heaven no stow'rs  They would refuse  Apollo  's self would seize  Th' occasion and myself thy servant am always  XXXV  O passing fair  Alma  to her replied  This gentle  Knight  the  Knight  full low did bend  No Impe of  Riotise  or boastful  Pride  I to thy favour strenuously commend  My strong deliverer and stedfast friend  O bear him to thy tow'r ypight on high  Or with him through these dainty regions wend  That he the deft inhabitants may spy  And feed with wonderment his knowledgesearching eye  XXXVI  She answer'd not but with most sweet aspect  Taking the Prince and Lady by the honde  Eftsoons she did them from the ground erect  And thro the air swift as the LevinBronde  Or if than it can swifter thing be conn'd  Darted upright ne did she stop ne stay  Till on her lofty espial they did stonde  Whence they the girding heavens might survey  And earth and ocean wide which low unneath them lay  XXXVII  It was a noble work for to behold  For neither was it built of stone ne lime  Ne was there ir'n ne brass ne lead ne gold  Ne  Roman  cement ne  Asphaltile  slime  To bind the parts and knit withouten rime  But it was all one piece of lucent glass  And edifyed by her in shortest time  Yet though both thin and seeming frail it was  No work on earth could it in lastingness surpass  XXXVIII  With rare imagin'd portraicts it was strow'd  Landscapes and histories by her design'd  For  what  she saw when raunging far abroad  She took her flight and left thilke tow'r behind  That  from the storehouse of her heedful mind  She would display before a painter fair  Who every form with skilful hand defin'd  And fetisely bedight with colours rare  Description  was her name a virgin debonair  XXXIX  Her pencil was most delicately fine  And light and strong the sketches which it drew  And beautifully did her colours shine  For the clouds checquer'd tints she in them threw  And the first drops of pearly morning dew  Aurora  's blush too when she first did wake  From  Venus'  smiles from  Cynthia  's silver hue  From  Flora  's mantle from the greensea lake  And all Dame  Nature  's works she did her colours take  XL  A reverend  Eld  the palat there did hold  And every colour set in proper place  His piersent eye his perfect senses told  The wrinkles did become his auntient face  And eke his hoary beard hung down with grace  Judgement  he hight his precept she obey'd  For he could teach her every stroke to trace  Full many a time her youthful hand he stay'd  When wantonly or when thro carelessness it stray'd  XLI  The  Briton Prince  with curious regard  The labours of these busied twain did see  Till  Fancy  calling him away debarr'd  His eyne intent on that imagery  Forthwith to her his step he hasted free  Tho he and  Alma  seated by her side  On a high battlement's extremity  She wav'd her hand then bid them throwen wide  Their looks toward the right and see the country's pride  XLII  They looked and beheld a country rare  The laughing meadows were with flow'rs bespread  The rose their shining Queen the lily fair  The cowslip drooping down his fainting head  The pink and tulip gay embroidered  Daisies and violets and all the crew  Which sweet impunging smells odorous bred  Or  Nature  with bright staines did imbrue  There 'sdaining touch of  Art  uncultivated grew  XLIII  And here and there did murm'ring rivers stray  Flowing entrailed in meanders clear  Now all so smoothly making gentle way  With dimpling surface that though placed near  The swain their progress onward ne mought hear  Now broke by mossy stones did hoarsly brawl  And prisoner took the willing thralled ear  Or bounding o'er a ragged rocky wall  From rift to rift in many a cascade did fall  XLIV  And up and down were many tufty groves  Lifting their heads in glory flourishing  Around whose trunks the honeysuckle roves  And scented jessamine is wandering  And purple grapes hung thickly clustering  And thousand thousand feather'd songsters lay  Concealed and melodiously did sing  While every bough and every treeen spray  Wav'd their consenting leaves and gladlier seem'd to play  XLV  And on the flowery meads and plains they spy  Fair flocks of sheep nibbling the tender green  Or ruminating as adown they lye  Or wanton sporting in the sunny sheen  And where or rock or rising hill is seen  The frisking goats their antick gambols made  And jolly keepers both did keep from teen  Who in the open sun or secret shade  Tuning uneven pipes their amorous descants play'd  XLVI  Soon did they see where from a grove issued  The goatfoot  Pan  playing a merry fit  Pleasaunt it was but rather rustic rude  Him follow'd dancing trimly to that dit  A croud of  Fawns  and  Satyrs  who with flit  And active giambeaux beat the hollow ground  While with them hand in hand their partners knit  The looselyrobed  Dryades  rebound  Their hair with oaken wreaths and palm and ivy crown'd  XLVII  They passed on and next most pleasing sight  The  God of Love  borne on a gentle lamb  Not he who armed dire by savage  Spite  And taught those cursed arts which sure I am  Have with disgraces shent his cruel  Dam  And als himself and crouds of wretches slain  With whose sad carcases the grave to cram  And crouds of wretches who alive remain  Have mur'd up with  Despair  and evergnarring  Pain  XLVIII  This  Winged Boy  a gentle mind did bear  As gentle as the beast which him upbore  Ne could he see th' unhappy drop a tear  But it would make his breast with pity sore  And he himself would weep and grieve therefore  He was not blind and from his looks did fly  The horrid face of  Lust  emboss'd with gore  And groveling mean  Deceit  and  Calumny  And by his side did wonne the maid  Sincerity  XLIX  Before her breast she bore a chrystal vase  In which her inmost thoughts were all pourtray'd  That ye each hidden sentiment mought trace  With this she oft hath  Villainy  warray'd  And made him stooping hide his felon head  Guarded with this she fears no secret harms  But walks secure as tho she were array'd  In strong defence by force of magick charms  Or girded firm with coat of mail and scaled arms  L  On t'other side holding a rosy band  With which that lamb she guided in the way  Or when his rider list him still to stand  Did softly check his pace and mildly sway  Wended fair  Innocence  her to survey  The angels would from heav'n on balmy wing  Gliding in mortal air their limbs embay  In t'other hand a serpent with fell sting  She held which lick'd her face ne any scathe did bring  LI  The next a nymph her countenaunce display'd  Blithe was her look unequal was her air  Her lineaments mought no one ever read  Ne yet the colour of her garb declare  Both of them every moment chaunging were  That fickle nymph had  Novelty  to name  Of  Admiration  she the loved feare  Her frequent chaunge did his light heart inflame  And looking on her greedily he onward came  LII  Behind them one twisting with all his might  A skein of silk which in his hand he bore  Yet tho he alway strained it full tight  No single thread would yield or break therefore  A swain who  Friendship  hight in human lore  And by his side another goodly swain  Call'd  SansSelflove  of mind most firm and sure  For he that other to secure from pain  Would naked rush on spears or plunge into the main  LIII  And now advanc'd the wight whom first they met  And with her babe that spouse so fair to see  To him full firmly bound in wedlock's net  And eke that other pledge of mutual gree  And close behind was virgin  Chastity  Bearing in her cold hands a lump of snow  Which though the warm west winds around her flee  Received no impuritie or flaw  Ne ever lost its white ne ever would it thaw  LIV  Long time she had betrothed bin I ween  Unto a comely youth of mickle praise  Fidelity  full steady was his mien  His eyes on her engrafted were always  Yet sich their look they ne mought her displease  This hand a golden sunflower did sustain  Still turning to the sun her constant rays  That a cameleon in a diamond chain  Which him in's native hue for ever did restrain  LV  And many more whom time to tell would fail  The  Prince  and  Alma  from their airy height  Might see with thilke same bevy fair to sail  There passed by the sister  Graces  bright  And  Liberty  unveil'd her peerless light  Benevolence  and  Gratitude  yfere  Beauty  all over lovely to the sight  There heartfelt  Ease  and  Leisure  ever dear  And happy  Indolence  and  Peace  brought up the rear  LVI  Then  Fancy  wav'd her hand but oh how strange  What at that potent motion ensued  Alack a day how suddain was the change  Black was the sky the blust'ring wind blew rude  Instead of company was solitude  Instead of gladsome sights a doleful glade  In which no chearful vision might intrude  For luckless Plaint as it beseemed made  Ah woe is me so soon all human glories fade  LVII  Forth came an hundred  Nymphs  with solemn tread  And flaming tedes in hand and then a  Queen  As seemed by the crown upon her head  Of beaten gold and her right royal mien  Her eyes with aweful dignity gave sheen  Her crimson vestment flow'd in stately pride  Which likest Scythian  Tomyris  was seen  When stain'd with Persian blood she  Cyrus  eyed  Or bold  Bonduca  when in Roman slaughter died  LVIII  Her left hand held a bowl with poison fraught  Which working quick dispatch was sure to kill  Her right a dreadful dagger sharply wrought  Which to the wight who list his blood to spill  She gave and bade him execute his will  Or if the bowl he chose to end his days  She stoop'd it down and told him drink his fill  Impurpled buskins on her legs she wore  Which with a golden clasp yclasped were before  LIX  Behind her was a wretch with garments rent  Hollow his cheeks and pale his dreary face  He mov'd as tho with weakness all forespent  Yet not uncomely was his weary pace  And his eyes gleamed with a languid grace  Misfortune  hight him in a brazen chain  Adversity  most cruelly did brace  And tho he seemed faint and well nigh slain  She nould him ever spare but dragg'd him on amain  LX  And ever and anon her arm on high  She would uplift which with an iron whip  Adaw'd and scowl on him with threat'ning eye  And oftimes would his cloaths with fury strip  And to the bones the skin therewith would rip  That he poor man would miserably groan  Yet not an evil word would he let slip  His virtue she not heeded nor his moan  Her heart had long ygo transmewed bin to stone  LXI  Behind him came with sweet aspect and bland  The fairest and the loveliest maid I ween  That ever yet on earthly mold did stand  Or ever was by mortal eyesight seen  When as she view'd that miser's doleful teen  O God how did she lift the heavy sigh  What would she give he mought relieved been  For him she could almost with pity die  So feeling was the soul of tender  Sympathy  LXII  Her beauty shew'd more lovely for the tears  Which all besprinkled had her face most meek  As for that wight beset with cruel fears  In vain they ren down o'er her heav'nly cheek  And blushing  Pudency  sat mantling there  Darting her beams the pearled moisture through  So seemingly enshrin'd as does appear  Through a thin cloud  Aurora  to the view  Or a sweet rosy bud thro' the clear ambient dew  LXIII  Two little  Cherubs  did afore her fly  One in his hand a golden censer bare  Which underneath her face he did apply  And therein latched every precious tear  Which fill'd he gave up to the others care  Who to the throne of all o'erswaying  Jove  Plying his purple plumes aloft did steer  He thilke same offering receiv'd with love  And shook with gracious sign his nectar'd locks above  LXIV  Next came  Remorse  his haggard eyes down bent  In ghastly silence glar'd upon the ground  But soon inflected inwardly were sent  As if to perse into his breast profound  There as tho tenting to the quick a wound  Would wring his hands in agony of pain  Or wildly toss them in the air around  Ah foredone wight thou but turmoilst in vain  The sore full deep hath fret and ever shall remain  LXV  Now  Indignation  with his eyen on fire  Welding a glitterand faulchion o'er his head  His red cheeks blushing with becoming ire  His stern brow frowning with a comely dread  For ay he was by  Reason  maistered  He with that faulchion fain would do to die  A snaky monster foul illfavoured  Guilt  who distraught with fear away did fly  Nor tho at distaunce got dar'd turn her craven eye  LXVI  Next  Horrour  harrows in his hand he bore  With which he felly harrowed up the soul  And all her finer senses rent and tore  So that his ravin she might not controul  But he there reigned King and Kesar sole  And  Hopeless Love  a shaft quite thro her heart  Had pass'd the wound she wrapped in her stole  Still struggling to conceal her deadly smart  And like a stricken deer pined away apart  LXVII  And many more attendant on that Queen  Their resience in thilke dark glade did keep  There wonn'd  Suspect  her face all sickly green  Excess of Grief  from whom no tears could creep  Vengeance  who both his hands in blood did steep  Envy  to her own mind the kestrel slave  Dissemblaunce  who like crocodile could weep  Madness  as wild as the enchauffed wave  And  Melancholy  silent as the midnight grave  LXVIII  There too was  Brave Disdain of deed that's base  And there of tried spirit  Conscious Pride  And  Emulation  which no second place  Would graunt and  Mercy  to the gods allied  And  Stoic Rigour  which all vice defied  And  Seemly Zeal  by  True Religion  drest  And  Wedded Love  which death cannot divide  And  Justice  wellspring pure of public rest  And  Filial Piety  with Heav'n's first promise blest  LXIX  All that mought rowse the soul of man was there  All that to goodness mought his bosom sway  And rescue him from Vice's per'lous meir  For  Virtue  marshall'd all in just array  That  Queen  herself does her behests obey  To her from first her origin she owes  Ne without her could reign a single day  By her she order from confusion draws  And all that diverse  Croud  acts as she gives them laws  LXX  And now at  Fancy  's bid gan disappear  The darksome dreriness which erst had blent  The sun of heav'n and hid his beamez clear  And with it all that foreseen  Many  went  While he his chearing rays more clear outsent  And now a public road before them lay  It seemed as there was some city near  For many a goodly troop pass'd by that way  Some rode some laughing walk'd some sung and some did play  LXXI  Close by the road an  Archer  took his stand  His low'ring brow announced vengeful ire  Two female forms were seen on either hand  Who him restrain'd within a certain gyre  With sober counsel smothering his fire  Candour  and  Truth  but he was  Satire  hight  They taught him against whom he war should stire  And when they pointed out the destin'd wight  He drew his bow and him imperst with arrow bright  LXXII  Those whom he so amerc'd with rigorous wound  By an old beldam had been bred a pest  Ycleped  Vice  some in disguises found  Others more openly that road t' infest  And unsuspecting passengers molest  But now did halt with limping pace along  While  Infamy  sat grinning on their crest  They joined not in daunce or jovial song  But shun'd and hated skulk'd at distaunce from the throng  LXXIII  Nathless when as his two companions cast  Their eyne aside he would with motion sly  A shaft from forth his quiver snatch in haste  And with insatiable cruelty  At travellers of goodly grace let fly  Which rueful scathe when as the  virgins  scann'd  To their assistance renning hastily  They pour'd in oil and balm with healing hand  But him with threats affray'd and bitter reprimand  LXXIV  Onward a little space there wonn'd a  Dame  Behind a vizor she aguis'd her face  Socks on her feet she had as her became  And her loose garb fell down with easy grace  Always attending constant on her pace  A selcouth hag a flaming brond who bore  Her name was  Secret Knowledge of Disgrace  A dwarf hight  Ridicule  was plac'd before  Who a large burnish'd mirrour stead of target wore  LXXV  Into thilke mirrour led by  Vanity  And  Folly  vain their semblaunces to view  Most of the silly croud who passed by  With idle mirth and wantonness nigh drew  But so deformed did they therein shew  They nould confess themselves to be the same  Until that  Hag  sprong from her hidden mew  Who dasht into their cheeks her brond of flame  And they retreated thence all covered with shame  LXXVI  But oh what tongue what language may suffice  With ample spirit fitly to express  The scenes that Potent Queen now bid arise  My simple numbers cannot aptly dress  In meet array ne yet their glory guess  When she the Briton Prince and eke his guide  With liberal kindness bounteously to bless  Unfolded to their sight ne yet envied  The regions where the lofty  Epic  doth reside  LXXVII  As though by pow'r past human from his bed  In nightly sleep a wight should snatched be  And cross the sounding seas be hurried  Then waking in the morn with wonder see  Himself in an unknown and strange country  Afore the  Amazons  huge floud latefound  Beyond an open realm uprising free  By the vast towering  Cordilleras  bound  And on the other side th'  Atlantic  waste profound  LXXVIII  So in amaze the Briton Prince was lost  For now down deepsunk vallies rough and steep  Huge rapid streams rolling his vision cross'd  Now without meir an ocean wide and deep  On which the lingering winds did seem to sleep  But soon with angry mood a whirlwind blew  No longer mought it now its calmness keep  But all with foamy wrath enraged grew  And from the fould'ring clouds the levin gaunt outslew  LXXIX  Now on the champion ground he might behold  Castles which seated were in pleasaunt site  And single  Knights  armed in glist'ring gold  With  Ladies  by their sides of beauty bright  To whom they told fair tales of love's delight  Or else for their protection combating  With monsters fell courageously did fight  Or in round lists each other conquering  To them the trophies of their victory did bring  LXXX  Now heard he braying trumpets numberless  The martial blast did his bold bosom thrill  Eftsoons two large enraunged  armies  press  The plain they shout they join they fight they kill  And the engorged earth with carnage fill  Tho saw he where the mountains rose on high  Striding from rock to rock from hill to hill  A giant form whose head arraught the sky  Emong the stars empight his name  Sublimity  LXXXI  These doen away a cloud of blazing sheen  Floating upon a forked hill appear'd  The brightness well nigh blent his feeble eyen  And from behind sich music was there heard  He thought himself to heaven's height uprear'd  And the great weight of pleasure scarce could bear  Ne wonder was't that he sich rapture shar'd  Whan  Jove  himself would often stoop his ear  From high  Olympus  top thilke harmony to hear  LXXXII  Where the thin edges of that cloud did reach  He might as 'twere part of a temple see  But though he strain'd his eyes to th' utmost stretch  They nould its shape distinguish perfectly  Yet it most gorgeous seemed for to be  But thro the middle of that cloud so bright  From whence issued the dulcet melody  He could by no means cast at all his sight  The oftener he look'd the stronger blaz'd the light  LXXXIII  And now said she O Prince what to thy view  I might disclose thine eyes have briefly seen  So much was to thy fair conductress due  To perse that dazling cloud thou see'st I ween  Thou must all over have besprinkled been  When thou wert born with dews of  Castaly  And thrice three times been dipp'd in  Hippocrene  There on his throne  Apollo  now I see  And there the  Muses  sit each in their just degree  LXXXIV  Yet even these thou shalt behold in time  But first thou many hardy fights must wage  And travel over many various clime  And with thy country's deadly foes engage  And curb the  Saxons  haught with strong menage  Tho they themselves shall take thee by the hand  And to that building with safe tutelage  Conducted thou in  Glory's Fane  shalt stand  And thy renowned name be read in every land  LXXXV  This saying she a privy door unbarr'd  Which led a winding passage to the ground  For though to climb up to that tow'r was hard  Down to descend was alway easy found  When they now touch'd the bottom of the mound  Many great thanks gave  Alma  to that Dame  And eke the  Prince  with humbless most profound  She upward shot like to an

Coronation  I  SLEEP'ST thou fair maid  Aeolian Virgin sleep'st thou in the cave  Of drowsy silence all array'd  In indolence supine  Does listless Morpheus wave  His torpidstriking wand thy brows around  Damping thy faculties divine  Arise fair maid arise  Shake off the tardiness of dull delay  Quick bid the sacred lyre resound  Quick tune th' harmonious lay  'Tis Brunswick claims the verse prepare  Thine eagleplumes and light as air  Sail through the azurevaulted skies  I  But first remove  Far from thy hallow'd presence the base train  Of fawning Flattery she to prove  Her love falls bestial down  Licking the dust disdain  So lowly to debase thine honest head  And soil thy verdant laurel crown  Back to thy shades retire  Immerge in solitude thy form august  Thy shining locks with darkness braid  Still rest in silence if the lust  Of fame entice thy voice to sing  The meanest of mankind a King  Whom vice and tyranny inspire  I  The worthless great to praise  Befits the hireling's prostituted pen  Who sells for fordid gold his venal lays  Though oft along the winding Seine  Though oft in days of elder date  On the green margin of the Tuscan stream  Dazzled by pomp's external state  Th' ignoble bard has strung the glozing lyre  Of specious falsehood yet the British Muse  Freeborn should spurn th' illusive theme  And fraught with conscious dignity refuse  On Folly's sons to waste her sacred fire  Or soothing regal grandeur weave  For undeserving Pride her everblooming wreathe  II  Such caution here  Is vain those fabling strains nor George requires  Neither art thou inclin'd to spare  Where Truth shall point the way  Thy progress he desires  And thou secure from harm shalt onward fly  Directed by her steady ray  Should meager Envy scowl  Thy steps before and grimlythreat'ning lance  Keen arrows from her poisonous eye  Unmov'd thou shalt advance  Smile in her face without a wound  Hear her fierce serpents hiss around  And all her illshap'd monsters howl  II  Chaste Virgin say  Where shall begin the song before my eyes  So various are the Forms which stray  That all confus'd my mind  And smit with wild surprise  Scarce keeps its proper function Here behold  Upon a craggy rock reclin'd  High stretch'd out o'er the main  Despair and Horrour on her faded brow  Sits Gallia while her arms enfold  The anguish of her breast as now  Wide o'er the deep she looks now o'er  Th' exhausted land her humbled power  She weeps thick falls the briny rain  II  Chang'd is the scene and here  Suppliant the savage chiefs of Indian race  In lowly guise with aspect meek appear  The rugged features of their face  No more with death and terror clad  Oft wont with wild foot through the dreary shade  To range with Slaughter oft when mad  With rage and hot revenge and fierce desire  Of blood and prey in the dead silent night  For still repose and slumber made  Have rais'd th' awakening yell of dread affright  Have basely slain the unresisting sire  The babe from its fond mother tore  Soon welt'ring in her own and her lov'd infants' gore  III  Well skill'd in guile  And treacherous as th' unsteady gale which waves  Its fickle pinion with a smile  Now o'er the tranquil sea  But soon with fury raves  And lifts its tortur'd billows to the sky  Where the bright chariot of the day  Bursts from his eastern goal  Striking the face of darkness with affright  And makes her ghastly shadows fly  Before the piercing light  Dread Eastern Tyrants wear the chain  Trust their deep policy in vain  And crafty wiliness of soul  III  Wheree'er his arms  Proceed the blooming form of Victory  Array'd in her full blaze of charms  Girds laurels round the brow  Of British Mars his eye  Gazes entranc'd upon the lovely maid  And rapturous thoughts endow  His soul with ecstasy  Say then bright Queen of song wilt thou entwine  A chaplet for his honour'd head  Wilt thou among th' assembled Nine  Extol th' intrepid deeds of War  The thunder of his rapid car  His spear and brazen panoply  III  Ah no for what though here  No vile ambition instigates to fight  Yet learn O Brunswick name for ever dear  To Albion's sons that at the sight  Of angry Justice from the eye  Of mild Humanity the pitying drop  Descends with tenderest sympathy  Each mourning Virtue casts the head aside  And every child of Reason and of Sense  Ah then be 't thine with haste to stop  The fatal steps of War and Death dispense  With generous thought and true heroic pride  The blessings which attend the train  Of hallow'd Peace and dignify her glorious reign  IV  And lo they come  Soft o'er the flowers of the velvet mead  Content and meckey'd Quiet roam  Or join the choral dance  By frolic Laughter led  And liberal Science rears her blushing face  And Merit dares advance  From the dark haunt of Scorn  Where she stray'd pensive many a long long day  And every Muse and sister Grace  On thee shall beam the living ray  Thy memory priz'd when those whose reign  Ambition guided shall remain  The curse of ages yet unborn  IV  And see to bless  Thy life to soften Grandeur's aking fears  With the chaste conjugal caress  To soothe the weighty toils  Of state and ease its cares  Where Charlotte every female virtue brings  Oh happy state in mutual smiles  Where souls communion mingle there  Love revels allluxuriant and free  There modest Transport waves her wing  There dwells exulting Harmony  With chaste Delight there ne'er is seen  Angry Suspicion's coward mien  Nor doubts nor jealousies appear  IV  Hail'd by a nation's voice  Long happy pair long may you wear the crown  By merit yours long may the land rejoice  Rul'd by a Prince who boasts himself her own  And when howe'er belov'd howe'er  Call'd on to stay the laws of fate  Which not transcendent goodness spare  Shall snatch you hence from a lamenting world  Heir to his father's virtues may a son  Another George direct th' affairs of state  And mount with glory his paternal throne  As now far off be angry Faction hurl'd  Diffusive Peace oh spread thy bounties wide  And may another nymph like Charlotte be his bride  To the LYRIC MUSE An ODE    SAY will the Lyric Muse  The themes of tender love refuse  Though she with haughty state presides  Over the big tumultuous tides  Which down the sacred mountain pour  And stun the ear with deafening roar  Yet where more gentle currents stray  And through the slowery vallies play  Laughing with transport as they flow  Where roses and where myrtles grow  She has e'er now been often found  To scatter her enchanting blessings round    Long in the Grecian isles  Retain'd by Cytheraea's smiles  Enamour'd of her rosy hue  While frolic pleasures round her flew  Stole from her lips the nectar'd kiss  And bath'd their lightplum'd wings in bliss  While Hebe danc'd with graceful tread  And the soft airs and passions led  While sallying from her temple's porch  Young Love wav'd high his magic torch  Thou too with sweetest look appear'd  And often thy melodious voice was heard    Hast thou forgot the melting strain  Which taught by thee thy Sappho sung  When stretch'd upon the Lesbian plain  O'er her the form of tender Pity hung  Didst thou not bountifully shed  Thy visions o'er Anacreon's head  And e'en the frozen breast of age  In amorous nets and toils engage  While all the virgins wondering stood  And laugh'd yet found themselves subdu'd  And when he immaturely died  Say did not Grief thy heavenly beauties hide  II  On what wideseated shore  Do mortals now thy name adore  Celestial Love Thy haunts of old  What clouds of darkness now enfold  Instead of the pure incense bright  Which then diffus'd a genial light  Within th'incircled Haram reign  Tyrannic Lust and jealous Pain  Bitter Constraint internal Fears  Lean Anguish and corroding Cares  Unknown are there the mutual sighs  Which from the sympathetic breast arise  II  Thy more than human mien  By Tiber has of yore been seen  And ere the Roman eagle flew  The sons of Britain to subdue  With native Innocence allied  Haply thy power did there reside  But big with plentitude of woes  From the rank earth a pest arose  Nature his shape with grief espied  And for her deathdoom'd offspring sigh'd  They sunk beneath an easy prey  And Love fled far from Avarice away  II  Didst thou then seek Columbia's strand  There thy propitious forehead shew  While rais'd by thy creative hand  The blooming flowers of social rapture grew  Too short a time alas from thence  Didst thou thy radiant gifts dispense  Behold th' impetuous monster haste  Rapine and Violence and Waste  Follow attendant on his flight  And lo before thy pitying sight  Welt'ring in blood thy people lies  To cursed gold the fated sacrifice  III  By force exil'd ah where  Did thy insulted steps repair  Some island in the southern main  Perhaps enjoy'd thy bounteous reign  Or didst thou steer thy vagrant course  To Orellana's distant source  There while in artlessness array'd  The youth beholds his sunburnt maid  There while of every wish possest  He leans with fondness on her breast  Thou seest them in the palmy grove  And o'er their heads thy purple pinions move  III  There too the heavenly Muse  Showers perchance her kindly dews  While thus some Indian Horace sings  As to his love he strikes the strings  " Ah when you praise my rival's charms  " His jetty neck and sable arms  " With passion swells my fervid breast  " With passion hard to be supprest  " My senses float in terrors vain  " My blood retreats and comes again  " The tears steal down my cheeks and say  " With what slow fires I totally decay"  III  Oh if with me ye gentle powers  Ye sometimes would but deign to dwell  Born by the quicklycircling hours  If ye would visit my sequester'd cell  One who with purest passion glows  Who not the face of Avarice knows  Nor by Ambition drawn aside  But owning Nature for his guide  Who from his earliest day of youth  Confess'd her charms and worshipp'd Truth  Ye in that secret cell should find  And subject to your laws a willing mind  ODE  I  WHO with ungovern'd tongue will blame  The verse th' eternal Muse inspires  The soulilluminating flame  Kindled at heaven's own sacred fires  Who but the wretch of narrow mind  Whose sentiments were ne'er refin'd  From the vile dross whose base alloy  Condemns him still to plod along  But one degree above the bestial throng  Unconscious of each nobler source of joy  I  Yet though unto the srigid ear  Of native Dallness every strain  Of melody uncouth appear  And all the gists of Science vain  Though dazzled by the blaze of light  Vice starting turns away her sight  From where the Muses fix their sway  Though Cruelty Revenge and Strife  And all the plagues which harrass human life  Keep far aloof and tread a distant way  I  Thy sons O Virtue with respect sincere  Bend lowly down before their holy shrine  To them they offer up the spotless prayer  And bless the influence of the powers divine  All who with more exalted thought  Have Wisdom's valued precepts sought  All who with pure emotions bless'd  Love Beauty by the Graces dress'd  All who to bounteous Nature just  Dare her instinctive feelings trust  The Muses hallow'd votary approve  Enjoy his considence and share his love  II  Hence then away ye vulgar crew  Such would I have condemn my lays  But hither turn ye worthier few  Embold'ned by whose genuine praise  Let the halfsoul'd coldblooded friend  Sneer while assecting to commend  Let the unfeeling fool laugh loud  To you alone the bard his lyre  Shall strike and quitting every mean desire  Soar far beyond the falselyjudging croud  II  Unhappy is the poet's fate  Th' intrinsic value of whose name  All will pretend to estimate  And at their will commend or blame  Empty deceit as if their eye  Could trace the light'ning through the sky  Pursue the comet's devious maze  Or looking on the blue profound  Where not the fathomline could ever sound  Pierce to the bottom with a single gaze  II  Ah wretch to whom 'tis given to possess  Superior strength and energy of mind  Unless he's planted in a sphere to bless  Even against their wills perverse mankind  Else mingling with the common train  Full of themselves he speaks in vain  Of if they hear his voice is styl'd  Extravagant excentric wild  Because his reason does not lie  Level with their capacity  Because his active sense springs 'tward the goal  And dwelling not on parts takes in the whole  III  Or if their weakness to befriend  O'er his own thoughts he cast a veil  Reflection's serious brow unbend  And her intenser rays conceal  They view him with familiar eyes  And being like themselves despise  O contradicting law the chain  Of Nature draws with all its power  To mix in life and seek the social hour  Indignant Reason goads us thence again  III  She proves how vague the hope how blind  Which on external good relies  Which seeks for aught among mankind  To gratify the just and wise  Ah where then should the Bard remove  Whose song the choral Nine approve  Or where the Sage whose breast disdains  The holy juggler's wily cheats  Where but to those retir'd and still retreats  Where Solitude close leagued with Virtue reigns  III  Hers are the Graces hers the winning charms  Which the fix'd bosom from conviction please  From necessary choice within her arms  We wish to spend the remnant of our days  Not so in our first greener years  New to this world of vice and cares  By Flattery taught for what is Fame  But a delusive idle name  Fading before the  living  breath  Though having pass'd the vale of Death  She may with vain solicitude return  And deck with fruitless wreathes the funeral urn  ODE  I  HOW lives the man whose thoughts have broke  Imperious Custom's servile yoke  Him Nature guiding by the hand  Leads on where Truth and Reason stand  Virtue her mantle round him flings  And Honour waves her silver wings  He does not yield to foreign laws  But wisely courts his own applause  Health sits inthroned in his eye  And Innocence walks smiling by  II  When sunk into the vale of years  His head the hoary foliage bears  He backward casts his tranquil sight  And views each scene reflected bright  No sullen damps his joy infest  No plagues of Avarice tear his breast  Him willing Duty hastes to serve  And strains with zeal each lab'ring nerve  While Love sits gazing on his face  Intent the latent wish to trace  SONNETS  Wrote at Inversnaid in Scotland in the year  SONNET I  HENCE Sickness nor about my weary head  Thy languid vapours wrap and drooping wings  Better would'st thou thy baleful poison shed  In some dark cave where the Nightraven sings  Where heavy sits the gloomdelighted Owl  Where Aconite its loathsome juices throws  Where dwells the Bat and Serpents hissing foul  And fell Despair who never knows repose  There drag with thee the wretch who has betray'd  His trust has ruin'd innocence or spilt  The sacred blood of him who gave him life  Him torture there nor will the lovely maid  The sweetey'd Mercy conscious of his guilt  Restrain thy hand or blunt thy sharpen'd knife  SONNET II  Though here almost eternal Winter reigns  And piercing deep the womb of Nature chills  Though born far off under a milder sky  The northern blast e'en through my marrow thrills  And freezes up the lifeblood in my veins  The hardy natives o'er the mountains high  Trace out the step of Health amid the snow  Or where o'er the gray moss her bare feet stray  Hence active nerves and scorn of danger flow  Hence when of late call'd forth to mortal fray  At their approach Revenge more furious grew  War smil'd while triple Rage new steel'd his heart  Pale bloodless Fear turn'd to a ghastlier hue  And Death more dreadful shook his pointed dart  SONNET III  When Recollection stirs up in the mind  And sets before her eye past scenes of woe  In vain will the wise men their sayings bring  Dead unimpassion'd wrote in the full flow  Of health and strength to nicer feelings blind  In vain against Reflection's piercing sting  They urge a formal phrase or adage quaint  And with a shrewd and wellturn'd point of wit  Or a laborious studied argument  Think to chase far away the fretful fit  They might as well drink the wide ocean dry  Or rob cold Winter of his snowy beard  Spite of the vain saws of Philosophy  Nature is prevalent and will be heard  SONNET IV  Now is the feudal vassalage destroy'd  By which the haughty Thane his subject train  Held at his will and in consinement strong  Fetter'd the servile crew and with stern reign  Led them in in shackles like brute beasts along  No will they ever of their own enjoy'd  But bent implicitly to his controul  Now by degrees they find that Liberty  Opens the narrow foldings of the soul  And they too dare to boast that they are free  No more with rapine they the fields infest  Or seek out Slaughter in her secret den  But by the laws of equal Justice blest  Humanely think and feel that they are men  A Picture of HUMAN LIFE  ELATE with Hope and her enlivening fires  I rush'd impetuous o'er the fields of youth  I gave up all my soul to gay desires  And Fancy's dazzling form mistook for Truth  She held her magick glass and strait I saw  A youth with rare accomplishments endued  Perfect he seem'd nor quickly did I know  That struck with wonder of myself I stood  When known a transient blush o'erspread my face  Selflove soon took the sanguine stain away  Increas'd each mental visionary grace  And deck'd each feature with a brighter ray  Wellpleas'd the treacherous Nymph O youth she cried  Point thy ideas to the highest aim  Why are superiour virtues still untried  Why does not Worth its lawful honours claim  Inactive rise lift thy aspiring brow  Thine be the joys of wealth of power of fame  Let thy young breast with emulation glow  Behold the noblest and be thou the same  Fool that I was with giddy transport blind  I swallow'd the sweet sound with eager ear  My eyes the latent poison could not find  Nor heart think evil of a shape so fair  Drunk as with wine methought I could attain  To be of each admiring tongue the theme  Whether I will'd th' heroick palm to gain  Or haunt the laurell'd shade of Academe  Whether with Love to waste the smiling hours  To melt the captiv'd virgin's icy breast  Or wander in the Muses roseate bowers  Weave the proud wreathe and dignify my crest  Methought my penetrating eye could dart  Through the black plots and mysteries of state  Pierce the thick foldings of the human heart  And rule with Judgement's voice the deep debate  Wildly fantastick the fierce northern blast  I might as soon with guiding rein have taught  Or dryshod o'er the billowy sea have past  As into form have chang'd unbodied thought  Ye gay delusions whither are ye fled  Begot by Health on Fiction's lovely form  Will ye ne'er gently hover o'er my head  With rapture ne'er again my bosom warm  Say canst thou bid old Time with stealthy pace  Retread the paths his feet have trod before  The sun mete backward his celestial race  And we'll again our pleasing dreams restore  Again from the full fount of life thy blood  Swift bursting forth shall swell each turgid vein  Th' enthusiastic spirits in a flood  From each strong nerve shall fire thy kindling brain  This Fate withstandsand Reason sternest guide  Contracts in narrower bounds th' excursive view  She plainly shews throughout the fleeting tide  Of Life what airy bubbles we pursue  By her does conscious Diffidence and Fear  Ambition's rage and Fancy's whims controul  The flighty purposes to youth so dear  And that wild elasticity of soul  Hence then ye vain ye unsubstantial joys  Able the selfdeluded soul to bless  Yet when alas among life's real toys  Shall I such soothing happiness possess  ODE  I  PUT on O Vice thy proper hue  In thy own native likeness stand  Soon shalt thou find thy subjects few  Thy throne uprear'd on sand  Abhorrent Nature with surprise  Would turn away her loathing eyes  Ingenuous Youth with pain  Thy monstrous shape would see  Cover'd with each toadspotted stain  While writhing Anguish and pale Infamy  Stalk close behind too desperate to complain  II  But cunning as thou art  Well dost thou know the human heart  Its intimate recesses lie  Open to thy wily eye  Hence thou with many a mimick grace  Stol'n from the Virtues as of old  Unconscious of an enemy so near  Always open and sincere  They stripp'd themselves to lave  Beneath a grot in the translucent wave  Hast deck'd thy odious face  III  Thy unsuspecting lover thinks them true  Of cloudy vapours made  A thousand dazzling forms parade  Before his cheated view  A thousand pleasures move  Breathing Mirth and social Love  Some with quickdoubling feet  And winning smiles advance  In the mazy circling dance  And then with more alluring step retreat  IV  Others on waving wing  Such notes of lively transport sing  Or varying now their strain  With such dying melody complain  That guided by th' enchanting sound  And swallowed up in hearing every sense  The cheated victim o'er the magick ground  Straying without defence  His careless progress takes  Till lost among inextricable brakes  Or in the midst of some wild heath forlorn  He finds himself at last  Hears nothing but the wintry blast  Which all his idle moanings flouts with scorn  V  Fatigu'd and spiritless he lies  Nor dares from the cold earth to rise  Night closes inAh where art thou  Celestial Hope thy face the darkness shrouds  Oh through the quickdisparting clouds  Appear and by the moon's clear ray  Let him behold thy placid brow  Faithful companion of thy way  By his golden lance well known  And firmingirding adamantine zone  Bring Resolution in a purple vest  By the young unfledg'd Moments drest  VI  O raise him in your arms and while his veins  Yet flow with life while any strength remains  Bear him away with swiftest course  For should Sleep on him steal  And with its dew his eyelids seal  Not even an immortal force  Could open them again no more  Shall he behold the sun of Virtue pour  Its radiance from the morningsky  Black mists shall round him ever fly  Or he shall fall from some steep mountain's brow  O'erwhelm'd by the deep flood that roars below  The Madness of ASPASIA  CURSE on the wretch whoe'er he be  That the fond maid betrays  Blasts unsuspecting Innocence  And snares for Virtue lays  Who works upon an easy mind  Causes of anger feigns  And to the Fair who loves him well  Of cold disdain complains  And when she opens all her soul  Seizes th' unguarded time  The sudden start of generous love  And glories in his crime  Such Cynthio such Aspasia was  In prime of earliest youth  She a devoted victim fell  To his pretended truth  Pall'd by possession though her soul  Was worth a kingdom's price  Yet all its charms could not retain  The harden'd slave of Vice  He gave her up to all the pangs  Which Delicacy knows  Which conscious of reproach and shame  From nicest feeling flows  Yet shall avengement sure though slow  Harass his guilty mind  That pity he denied to her  Will be from him confin'd  The grief th' unutterable grief  Which to her sire befell  No pen no other tongue but that  Of a fond sire can tell  Let us my friends says he find out  Where the afflicted strays  Let us if possible at least  Give her some little ease  Her bosom with the lenient balm  Of tender Pity fill  Or sit in silent woe around  As the mute mourner still  But stay she comes along this path  Oh thou heartbreaking sight  Before my eyes this hour had seen  Would they'd been steep'd in night  She's mad my friends I see it well  I read it in her eye  That wild glance thrown around bespeaks  Th' extreme of misery  She opes her pallid lips to speak  O ruin'd Excellence  Pour forth thy unconnected thoughts  And reave me of my sense  I've been to yonder wood to gather flowers  There on a bank so steep  I saw him lying fast asleep  I stole on softly to the bowers  No ear  My silent step could hear  For why should I awake  Or cause him from his sleep to start  But a fierce snake  My footsteps did pursue  I nothing of it knew  And springing on me eat out all my heart  See what a frightful wound  Ah no it cannot now be found  So I snatch'd up my flowers in haste  And round my head have trac'd  But they're too bright and gay  As I wear them in my hair  They make my complexion more faded appear  Away away away  Yet I have been as fair as they  But should  they  be betrayed  Depriv'd of their bloom  They'd sink down to the tomb  And be pale and wan like me  Be sure with them let my hearse be drest  And strew them o'er my earthly bed  Where I shall shortly lie  When the cold turf supports my head  I'll take my fill of rest  The worm sha'n't hear me sigh  But I pray you secret prove  Tell it not to my love  Nor let him that way go  For should he come in  And see me look so thin  His heart would burst in two  Nohe has quite forgot  He says he knows me not  Now in my misery  And will you believe him too  Has madness seiz'd your mind  Though you may think him true  The faithless seas and wind  Are not more false than he  Methinks I can't but smile  That he should  you  beguile  I  heed not what he says  But stop up my ears  And am deaf to his prayers  In vain his slatteries he displays  And tells me I am fair  As the newfallen snow  That my keen eyes have pierc'd him through  That me alone he lovesNo no  When once deceiv'd beware  Fool that I was I thought him true  Oh snatch him snatch him from my view  Yet ye tormentors set him free  Give him his liberty  The pain his conscience brings  Is worse than all your racks of steel  Your whips and cruel stings  I know what he must feel  He swore so holy was his flame  That I should never know  A pleasure or a woe  But he should feel the same  So bid the bridemaids come  I'll be dress'd all in white  We'll take the damask room  'Tis long before 'tis night  What say you Lost 'tis all a jest  It is not yet quite dark  He stays till I'm undrest  Is that the morning lark  Not yet return'd where fled where fled  Alas I knew it well  I knew that he was dead  Although you would not tell  I'm wonderous cold My hands are clay  My blood in frost is bound  Yet force me not away  We'll lie in the same spot of ground  Under this marble stone  I shall enjoy him all alone  Oh help my friends her shuddering limbs  Her interrupted breath  And those convulsive strugglings speak  The quick approach of death  And are there powers in heaven above  Will they this sight behold  Then Virtue droop thy fearful head  Exulting Vice be bold  Oh take her gently from the ground  Alas she moves no more  Her mortal pilgrimage is past  And mine will soon be o'er  An ELEGY  Transposed from SPENSER  WHEN first before my youthful eyes  I saw the form of Sylvia move  I gaz'd upon her with surprise  But not one thought had I of love  My soul grew fond of fancies vain  Tetchy and froward nought could please  Yet knew I not what gave me pain  Nor thought it love but some disease  Soon as the beauty of the sky  Night had defac'd with pallid hue  Striving to sleep I down should lie  But sleep away far from me flew  Instead thereof sad sighs and fears  About me cruel watch maintain'd  Forth gush'd th' involuntary tears  And Sorrow then triumphant reign'd  If any drop of slumb'ring rest  Into my weary soul distill'd  What frightful dreams would then infest  What horrour through my bosom thrill'd  Then up I from my bed should start  And all my former grief renew  Think on that image in my heart  And all its heavenly charms review  All night a stranger to repose  To ease a stranger all the day  No sports no company I chose  To Solitude a willing prey  Thus car'd I not abroad to spread  Youth's plant when in its fairest prime  But let it all neglected shed  Both fruit and flower before its time  Alas should this be love I cried  Too late the fatal cause I found  In vain each lenient art I tried  Too deep had pierc'd the rankling wound  Nor other cure had I for grief  But my hard fortune to deplore  To languish like the fallen leaf  And feed with plaints th' impoison'd sore  Thus t'ward the silent grave I pac'd  Thus by degrees decay'd my frame  Till by the long and lingering waste  I like a pined ghost became  INSCRIPTION for an ARBOUR  ENTER of welcome sure beneath this shade  Ye sacred few whose eyes can see with scorn  The pomp of Luxury who unseduc'd  Can leave behind the city's noisy hum  And smitten with the charms of Innocence  Pleas'd with the lowly glen and verdant lawn  The leafy covert and secure retreat  Can hear with calm delight the thrush attune  His wildlywarbled note can hear with joy  The village hind whistle his uncouth tune  And th' herd loudlowing in the dale beneath  INSCRIPTION on a TREE in the centre of a Grove  THE Hamadryads who inform this grove  Are pure nor underneath their sheltering boughs  Harbour a thing profane you they invite  Ye virtuous Indolent who scorn to act  In the corrupted scenes of public life  The friends of heartfelt joy with open arms  Receive Benevolence hear the Muse pour  Her artless song wellpleas'd and in their shade  Bid Love's blithe form sport all the summer long  A RANT  WINE I feel thy rapt'ring power  Thine is all the present hour  Strong Delight tumultuous reigns  And throbs throughout my bursting veins  All my heart is open wide  Every bar is thrown aside  Prudence hence it loaths to trace  The features of thy simpering face  Thy sobermeasur'd gait to spy  And leaden joyforbidding eye  Prudence hence thy laws I scorn  Thou of mean Deceit art born  By fly Hypocrisy begot  Noble Frankness heeds thee not  Yet though all my sallying soul  Expatiates wide and hates controul  Though my thoughts unbridled dare  Forward fly in wild career  In their most impetuous course  Let me Reason own thy force  Though thou totter'st on thy throne  Let me call thee still my own  For so mad I would not be  As quite to lose the sight of thee  An ODE  NO ye beckon me in vain  Your allurements I disdain  Powers of riot God of wine  Though thy glist'ning forehead shine  Through the garland which around  Is so negligently bound  Though Joy flashes from thy eye  Though the purple goblet high  Foams with wine on thy right hand  Though the soul of Pleasure stand  And Wit and unlac'd Gaiety  Which with Humour ever free  Jest delighted while beside  Laughter sits and ope'ing wide  His mouth lets forth a pealing din  And shakes his jolly double chin  God of wine thou call'st in vain  Thy allurements I disdain  Lo she comes the Cyprian Queen  Mark her soulinflaming mien  Thinly clad the Luscious Fair  In Modesty's dissembled air  Hear the faintlybroken sighs  See her panting bosom rise  Two twin orbs of snowy white  Gently swelling to the sight  Languid eyes extinct their fire  Well they speak intense desire  Does not maddening Fancy rove  Through every vein provoking love  Snatch O snatch me to thy arms  Feast on willing Beauty's charms  Luxurious feast without controul  And bathe in rapture all thy soul  Cyprian Venus hence away  Scorn attends thy longer stay  I detest the bought embrace  Well I know thy practis'd face  Hence to unsuspicious Youth  Palm on him pretence for truth  By Experience rightly taught  Mine be Reason's sober thought  Temperance and her srugal hoard  Slender fare and homely board  Mine be calm domestick life  The nuptial bed the tender wife  The smiling infant on my knee  Chirping its little tale with glee  So shall Health attend me still  So shall Pleasure drink her fill  From the purest source of joy  So shall Love without alloy  Frolick o'er the hallow'd ground  And wave his genial wing around  Cyprian Venus to my eyes  When these homefelt transports rise  Bacchus' riotbreeding train  And thy embraces I disdain  On the Dead Sparrow of LESBIA  From Catullus  O Venus O ye Loves bewail  And all who finer passions feel  Dead is the sparrow of my Fair  The sparrow who her tender care  Who her excess of fondness prov'd  Whom dearer than her eyes she lov'd  For he the sweetest mind possess'd  Conscious by whom he was caress'd  He ne'er from her endearments flew  Not she her mother better knew  But leaping round in wanton play  Twitter'd to her the livelong day  Now goes he to the gloomy bourn  Whence no one ever may return  Perish ye fatal shades who spare  Nothing that's either good or fair  Now have ye snatch'd with ruthless mind  The best and fairest of his kind  O Impious Deed from chearful Day  To force the little wretch away  For whom my Girl finds no relief  Her swelling eyes are red with grief  TO SLEEP  WHERE are the downy slumbers fled  Which hover'd nightly o'er my head  And soon as I my pillow prest  Clos'd my eyes in sweetest rest  By wakeful Love forbid to stay  Alas too long ye keep away  O come ye vagrant slumbers spread  Again your pinions o'er my head  O long unchear'd by sweet repose  Again my fainting eyelids close  ELEGY  THE truest Love is still reserv'd and shy  No look of confidence or boldness wears  Known by the humble brow and soften'd eye  And full of wavering doubts and anxious fears  When I perceiv'd that Thespia had o'ercome  My yielding heart and fixt her empire there  That from her hands I must receive my doom  And all my future weal must flow from her  What dreadful strugglings did I undergo  'Twixt native bashfulness and strong desire  How did my senses fluctuate to and fro  'Twixt soft respectful Love and Passion's fire  Oft did I wish the secret to have told  But awe and modest dread too much prevail'd  Her presence all my faculties controul'd  And every settled resolution fail'd  At length with firm intent I sought the Fair  With firm intent to pour out all my heart  To let her know the story of my care  And the long misery of consuming smart  Her steps I to a secret garden drew  She without guile went innocently free  No ill suspecting for no ill she knew  Nor fear'd to trust herself alone with me  At first to talk as usual I assay'd  Hoping thereby to gain a tranquil air  And as along the walk we slowly stray'd  Pluck'd frequent flowers and stuck them in her hair  But still my shorten'd breath fast went and came  O'er my embarrass'd limbs a stiffness hung  My heart throbb'd strong and shook my lab'ring frame  And fears I know not how unnerv'd my tongue  Resolv'd to speak some secret power restrain'd  Asham'd and angry with myself I grew  With crimson consciousness my cheeks were stain'd  And quick again the conscious stains withdrew  She whether unobservant all the while  Or else my strange confusion to relieve  Indifferently talk'd with careless smile  But I to what she said no heed could give  Then chang'd my sickle mind its first design  Determin'd sudden on some future day  Then would I each perplexity untwine  And every ardent with before her lay  A transient calm succeeded in my breast  Yet sure thought I I have not so conceal'd  But she th' emotions of my soul has guess'd  Perhaps she wishes too they were reveal'd  Though now my faultering tongue its aid denies  She must have read the language of my soul  Nor have I mark'd displeasure in her eyes  When forth from mine the glance of Love has stole  Then turning round in haste as if afraid  Lest Diffidence again might intervene  Not daring to erect my timid head  My hesitating lips disclos'd my pain  ELEGY  IN nothing was I learn'd but only how  To pen my flocks and drive them to the field  In the strait furrow how to guide my plough  And how my hoe and pruninghook to wield  Uncultivated was my mind and mean  My abject thoughts low fasten'd to the earth  Till Love with hand benign broke Custom's chain  And bade me soar beyond my humble birth  With beauty fir'd I look'd around and saw  The charms of Nature never seen before  O Love a willing vassal to thy law  I bend I feel thy blessings and adore  Prompted by thee  as yet  with trembling tongue  I call'd the Muses and desir'd their aid  My woodnotes in the hazel copse I sung  And caught th' attention of the listening maid  She listen'd to my strains she heard my tale  While deepening blushes o'er her cheeks arise  The soft consenting sigh my lips inhale  I see the yielding languor of her eyes  No true to Love if ever I estrange  For any other Fair my thoughts from thee  Why utter needless vows I cannot change  It is impossible nor e'er will be  O Love I own thy sway by thee my mind  The face of lowliv'd Avarice disdains  The common vice of Passion unrefin'd  The common vice among our country Swains  Hence cares and troubles hence do they behold  The state of riches with an envious eye  They think not aught beyond the power of gold  Nor know how Love can lift the soul on high  O come my Fairone I have thatch'd above  And whiten'd all around my little cot  I've shorn the hedges leading to the grove  Nor is the seat and willow bower forgot  Low is the path of life in which I move  Thou might'st perhaps have reach'd the higher sphere  Of Wealth and noisy Pride but faithful Love  And Innocence and sweet Content are here  ELEGY  STILL Blooming Health upon my Thespia's face  Through the clear surface let thy tints appear  O'er every feature shed thy modest grace  And let thy balmy smiles be ever there  Protect her where she goes ye Gentle Powers  Pure Denizons of undulating air  Whether from glowing noontides sultry hours  Or Evening's dewy shades protect the Fair  'Tis true my Thespia I indeed confess  That selfish are the prayers and vows I pay  With no disinterested voice I bless  The Gods or pour the supplicating lay  For ah from thee and from thy looks I find  Warm to my heart each cordial joy must flow  Sweet'ning the ills of Life from thee my mind  Must taste its keenest sense of piercing woe  Thine is the masterkey each spring to rule  Each hidden movement of my secret thought  Sure thou wert bred in some Enchanter's school  Who all his spells and mystick charms has taught  Yet then would Holy Truth with thee reside  Truth which unbounded Confidence may trust  Yet then would mean Deceit fly far aside  And wild Caprice confounding false and just  Wouldst thou have said as I struck dumb with fear  Tremblingly pointed out my humble bower  Haply Tranquillity and Peace are there  For them I scorn the gawdy farce of Power  O thou sincerest how shall I repay  The endless debt of gratitude I owe  Quickly my Fair point out to me the way  And shew the path for thou alone canst shew  Though silent is thy tongue thy speaking eye  The modest blushes o'er thy cheeks which rove  That deepdrawn breath that panting breast reply  The sole return is tenderness and love  And is that all and dost thou ask no more  Whether I will or no I needs must give  That gift nay lavish on thee all my store  Nor cease to love thee till I cease to live  For ever rivetted within my heart  Thy lov'd thy dearest image shall remain  Whene'er from thence I bid it to depart  May I by some tremendous stroke be slain  No common death I shall deserve to die  To pine by inches on a barren strand  Scorch'd by the 'vengeful Sun's severest eye  Nor by one sportive wandering Zephyr fann'd  To freeze on some bleak rock to glut the rage  Of howling beasts within the dreary waste  Or live in youth despis'd in helpless age  Th' extremities of want and woe to taste  To walk a moving plague among mankind  Shun'd hated and refus'd the alms I crave  The only thing I wish for not to find  A still retirement in the peaceful grave  In that fond hope to be deceiv'd to hear  With soul yet conscious in the churchyard way  The fierce invective cast upon my bier  And Scornful Laughter dancing o'er my clay  All this and more I shall deserve to prove  When led by changesul Fancy's wanton eye  I turn a faithless truant to thy love  And on the wings of vagrant Falsehood fly  ELEGY  AH whence my Thespia can that anguish flow  That silent anguish of expressive woe  That sigh which from thy struggling bosom stole  That look which pierces to my inmost soul  Ah say my Thespia I conjure thee say  To  me  the hidden cause thou  mayst  display  Half of thyself I claim my lawful share  Yet would to Heaven that I the whole might bear  Pour out thy thoughts in confidence to me  Thou  must  not hide from  me  thy misery  From thee would I my labouring heart confine  And are not all its deepest secrets thine  Wretch that I am am I who thee from pain  To shield would pour out life at every vein  Am I the cause and couldst thou ever spy  A look of coldness glancing from my eye  To thee a cold blank look O too refin'd  And subtile errour of thy feeling mind  A delicacy apt too deep to dive  To each nice touch too tenderly alive  Though I esteem it as a blessing sent  As the more polish'd mind's chief ornament  A sacred spark kindled by Heaven's own ray  Yet let not Sensibility betray  Thou weep'st where did my tongue profanely rove  How could I blame thee 'twas excess of Love  O let me circle thee with strict embrace  Warm breast to breast and glowing face to face  My fixed lips while speechless rapture ties  Imbibe the lucid moisture of thine eyes  Thy melting spirit in each breath inhale  Gaze on thee till my cracking eyestrings fail  And quite o'erpower'd by Love's imperious sway  Feel all my fainting soul dissolve away  ELEGY  WHAT have I done what crime in me is found  What secret evil lurking in my breast  That while all Nature else is smiling round  Heaven has on me its heaviest stroke impress'd  Have I e'er dropp'd a wish of other's harm  Or done an ill though ne'er to be reveal'd  Have I not always breath'd th' emotion warm  On the chaste lip of Social Virtue seal'd  Ah is it not enough that far away  From my own native happy fields I rove  Far from each friendly name condemn'd to stray  And torn by cruel force from her I love  But must through her the barbed steel be sent  Which piercing with severest torture wounds  Must she I love convey the punishment  Which Justice' self must own exceeds its bounds  On me rain all your woes ye righteous Powers  Though hard I'll strive the misery to bear  View Sickness steal away my lingering hours  On tainted wing nor drop a pining tear  But ah the gentle Virgin's tender frame  O Brighthair'd Chastity O Angel Truth  If ye are aught beyond an empty name  Save save in pity Innocence and Youth  Shield shield me from the racking thought I spy  From her cold cheeks the bland suffusion fled  Dead is the piercing magick of her eye  The lustredarting beam of sense is dead  She calls on meOh snatch the last embrace  Woods rivers mountains countries intervene  Oh curse of curses ne'er that lovely face  Again shall I behold e'en the last scene  Some dreary satisfaction might afford  Some solace to the madness of Despair  Gloating in secret on his gloomy hoard  With eye intorted viewing what is there  FINIS
