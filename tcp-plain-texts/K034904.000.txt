 A PLAN for a  TOWN and TOWNSHIP  to be laid out within the Compass of ONE SQUARE MILE or  Acres  Containing Town Lots for  Planters  or  Farmers  having large Out Lots beyond the Township  also Town Lots for Public Officers and for Troulesmen Clerks Artificers Fishermen Seamen or Labourers in all  Town Lots  with small  Outlots  of a Quarter of a Square Furlong or ½ Acres each for the said▪ Officers Labourers within of a Mile from each side of the Town  A GENERAL PLAN FOR LAYING OUT TOWNS AND TOWNSHIPS ON THE NEWACQUIRED LANDS IN THE  EAST INDIES AMERICA  OR ELSEWHERE  In order to promote Cultivation and raise the Value of all the adjoining Land at the Price of giving  gratis  the  TownLots  and in some Cases as in new Colonies also the small  OutLots  to the first Settlers and their Heirs so long as they possess  no other Land  and on other equitable Conditions    EXPLANATION OF THE ANNEXED PLAN  THE town distinguished by being coloured red is contained in a square each side of which is furlongs or half a mile having a square furlong or acres in the centre appropriated to public offices  viz  a church townhall guardhouse separate penitentiary lots or prisons for males and females also schools for each sex and a public caravansera for strangers and travellers under the control of the constable on guard by rotation The Breadth of the streets and highways is proposed to be the th part of a furlong or feet inches which will allow room for aquaducts wherever streams of water can be in∣troduced from superior levels and also room for planting ranges of spreading trees to shelter the foot∣paths And as the bounds of each square furlong meet in the centre of the streets measured from the external edges or sides of the town coloured red which are distant each from its opposite side com∣plete furlongs or half a mile inches by the scale these external edges or lines of the town and the streets must be first laid out that the remaining space in each square furlong of the town may be divided into  townlots  in equal proportions  viz  opposite sides of the town are appropriated to large townlots of nearly one acre each for PLANTERS or FARMERS  and as these  large townlots  commence from the ex∣ternal edge of the town and not from the centre of the streets like the  small townlots  their length will be a complete half furlong or feet In their breadth there will be some variation The uppermost and undermost divisions of square furlongs being measured from the external edges or red lines at the top and bottom of the town as represented in this Plan have a deduction of feet inches for half the width of the street on one side only which subtracted from feet the breadth of the furlong leaves a space of feet inches for the breadth of lots Which space divided by allows the breadth of each PLANTER'S TOWNLOT in the uppermost and lowermost divisions to be feet inches includ∣ing the fences and the PLANTERS  townlots  in the central divisions as the central divisions have a street on sides must lose feet inches from the width of each furlong which being first deducted from the feet leave a breadth of only feet inches to be divided into equal parts whereby the width of the PLANTERS  lots  in the central divisions is reduced to feet inches each including the fences  The size of the small townlots will also unavoid∣ably vary and be of two different dimensions as to their  breadth  though all are of equal  length  For as they are measured from the centre of each square furlong to the centre of the streets a deduction of feet inches half the width of the streets must be made from the  length  of half a furlong or feet which reduces the length of each lot to feet inches And feet inches being also deducted  from the  breadth  of the uppermost and lowest ranges of square furlongs for half the width of the street on one side of each furlong the space for the width of lots is thereby reduced to feet inches which divided by gives feet inch and half for the width of each lot including the fences And feet inches being deducted from the central divisions for half the width of the streets on sides of each division or square furlong reduce the space for lots to feet inches which divided by gives only feet inches for the width of the  small town∣lots  in the  central  divisions including their respective fences  N B  In old settled countries where land is al∣ready of considerable value it is not to be supposed that the proprietors of land can be induced to  give gratis  more than the  small townlots  of half an acre and a few poles each which with the roads and streets will amount to about acres to be given  gratis  out of acres or less than ¾ per cent and the improved value of the remaining estate most cer∣tainly will amply repay the donation as the value of land is generally doubled by the proximity of a town  And as even this last proposed donation of acres will be much too large a venture for land∣holders in general to risque in such an experiment it is necessary to remark that they may proceed on the half of this plan quite as effectually by dividing the town and township in the centre whereby the land to be  given gratis  or granted in  freehold  to the settlers will not exceed acres And even with this  large reduction of the plan space will be reserved for the families of farmers or planters and of ar∣tificers or labourers and as the line of division in this latter mode will pass through the centre square of the present plan additional small townlots may be formed in the space of half the square and half of the public lots around it which will enable the town upon the whole to contain households And if cottages for labourers be added at the outer gates or avenues of the estate the community will form a complete  hundred  of householders which is a very respectable body of people for maintaining peace and good order according to the common law of England  Whenever only  one half  of the plan is adopted the side where the central line of division is made must be placed next to the water whether the sea or river creek or canal and care must be taken that a suf∣ficient  strand  or space of  common land  be reserved be∣tween the town and the water that all the inhabit∣ants may have equal access to the waterside  PROOF OF THE MEASUREMENTS  In one Quarter

peaceable Regulation of the several Towns or Communities  THE Proprietors of the land should give  gratis  to each male settler of good moral character and of ability to labour one small  townlot  and in new settlements where few labourers can be pro∣cured also one of the small  outlots  of ½ acres  gratis  so long as they possess  no other land  but no longer for strict provision should be made in the grants that no man shall hold lots in the same town even if an additional lot should fall to him by inheritance or be acquired in any other way for that would destroy the safety of the town by de∣creasing the number of inhabitants and that no lot which had once been given  gratis  should ever afterwards be either  sold  or let at rent to any undertenant or be added to any other lot on the penalty of forfeiture to the first granter or granters or to their heirs or successors to be by them once more bestowed for the same benevolent purpose on some other industrious tradesman or labourer who has  no other land  already in possession that the num∣ber and strength of the little community may be maintained And if the first granter c should neglect such disposal of any forfeited or vacant lot more than months the right of disposal as above should lapse and be vested in the house∣holders of the town where the forfeiture is incurred according to the election of the majority of them in common council assembled  But though the settlers may not sell let or en∣large their lots when they acquire other lands  either by inheritance or otherwise yet they may nevertheless be allowed to present in free gift the possession of their lots when so vacated by addi∣tional landed property elsewhere on the same limited terms to any person whom they shall think proper to elect provided such person hath not already any other land in possession  But with respect to the larger townlots for planters or farmers marked A B C D c they may be as appendages or  homesteds  to the farms or large outlots extending beyond the  lesser township  and of course they may be let or sold with those farms as the proprietors or granters of the land may think best for their own advantage And so likewise with respect to the  small outlots  in the  lesser township  when∣ever the proprietors of the land shall have reserved to themselves that power in their original grants  And for the safety and happiness of each commu∣nity the land should be granted on the farther espe∣cial condition that the settlers shall promise to keep watch and ward by rotation of  militia  service under their own elected chiefs that they may duly main∣tain PEACE JUSTICE and COMMON RIGHT in their respective communities and folkmotes according to the common law of England in FRANKPLEDGE which is the  only  effectual mode of obtaining  law peace  and  good government  without expence  A DESCRIPTION OF FRANKPLEDGE  FRANKPLEDGE is an ancient patriarchal mode of ar∣ranging the families or rather  households  of a nation  in numerical divisions of TENS or  tythings  FIFTIES HUNDREDS or wappentacs and THOUSANDS  See Deut i  "Take ye"  or rather according to the Hebrew "CHUSE YE  to  YOURSELVES"  wise men and un∣derstanding and known among your tribes  which necessarily im∣plies that the tribes were to nominate  "and I"  said Moses  "will make them rulers over you"  i e the returns of the elections were to be made to Moses and he was to invest the elected with public authority  "and ye"  said Moses  answered me and said The thing which thou hast spoken  is  good  for us  to do  Thus Moses like a good politician and faithful public minister under God declared the  free assent  of the people whereby the important measure he himself had proposed of establishing Frank∣pledge by the advice of Jethro was enacted and became a public law or statute of that nation Israel as much as it has been enacted to Englishmen by MAGNA CHARTA  "So I took"  said Moses  "the chief of your tribes wise men and known"  that is  "known among the tribes"  as expressed in the th verse which necessary qualification could not fairly be ascertained unless the  known men  were really returned or named to Moses as such by the tribes themselves  "and made them heads over you captains"  or heads  "over  THOUSANDS  and captains over  HUNDREDS" what we call  hundreders  or high constables  and captains over  FIFTIES  and captains over  TENS  or tythingmen  and officers among your tribes  Thus it appears that the officers in general from the colonel or captain of a thousand whether of individuals or families down to the serjeant constable or tythingman were recommended or rather nominated by the people before they were invested with authority by Moses  "And I said Moses  charged your  JUDGES  at that time  " whereby it must of course be understood that the JUDGES also had been previously nominated by the people as  wise men and under∣standing and known among the tribes  agreeable to the pre∣ceding enacted proposal  saying hear  the causes  between your brethren and judge righteously between  every  man and his brother and the stranger  that is  with him  YE SHALL NOT RESPECT PERSONS IN JUDGMENT  Deut i Com∣pare this with Deut xvi  Judges and officers shalt thou  GIVE TO THYSELF  in all thy gates throughout thy tribes and they shall judge the people with  JUST JUDGMENT c and the rule for JUST JUDGMENT is NOT TO RESPECT PERSONS IN JUDG∣MENT  But the colonial legislators in all the European settlements of America and the West Indies in order to favour and tolerate  slavery  have suppressed this  indispensable  rule for "JUST JUDGMENT" for otherwise that abominable pagan op∣pression  slavery  which had been gradually abolished through the happy influence of Christianity could not have been renewed under governments which still call themselves christian But this hateful mark of reprobacy and delinquency of the nations or rather  "of the fulness of the Gentiles"  I mean the baneful re∣newal of  pagan slavery  will surely draw down upon the guilty nations a severe  retribution  from that Supreme Judge who  I  NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS IN JUDGMENT  if they cannot find leisure from their bloody wars and destructive oppressions for  repentance  For the Divine  retribution  is clearly revealed in the Scriptures that it will be  "measure for measure"  that  that leadeth into captivity shall be led into captivity He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword  For the AL∣MIGHTY has promised to "DESTROY  them who  DESTHOY  the "earth"  of  householders  or  masters of families  including all that either  rent a house by the year  on which the right of  burgage tenure  in England is founded or live in their own houses and pay their due proportion of public expences  All such by this most ancient and salutary system were required to  pledge  each other and to  pledge  or be responsible for every other individual living under their respective roofs whereby  all  persons were rendered most completely and readily amenable to JUST LAWS an indispensable condition of LI∣BERTY because neither LIBERTY nor JUSTICE can walk upright and secure unless they go hand in  hand for every breach of the public peace or for any breach even of  common morality  or  decency  that could be deemed hurtful or inconvenient to others in the judgment of an impartial jury of neighbours subject to the previous challenge of the persons ac∣cused or indited in so full and effectual a manner  as to exclude all suspicion of partiality  and this under MAGISTRATES and PUBLIC OFFICERS  freely elected by the  HOUSEHOLDERS  of every district  for short pro∣bationary terms of power never exceeding months without reelection by a majority of the HOUSEHOLDERS over whom respectively their dele∣gated power extended  It was a just and wise principle of  the ancient con∣stitution of England  to vest ALL ELECTIONRIGHTS  in the  HOUSEHOLDERS paying scot and lot or the ordinary public rates but a farther extension of the franchise to  every individual of the community  which some wellmeaning friends to reformation have pro∣posed would be  a vain innovation  that might per∣haps prove as  dangerous  as it is certainly  inexpedient  and  needless  because the  ancient constitution of  FRANK∣PLEDGE which vested  the right of election  in the  householders alone  is distinguished in the lawbooks  See Lambard's Archionomia inter Leges Edwardi Regis  de  ibergis where FRANKPLEDGE is more particularly ex∣  ed  y the peculiar style of SUMMA ET MAXIMA SECU∣  ITAS  the chief and greatest security  a title justly  unded on the practical experience of ages And  erefore though  the first plants  to be cultivated in  colonies and communities are most certainly the  sacred plants of RIGHTEOUSNESS PEACE and LI∣BERTY yet even these indispensable plants cannot so effectually take root and flourish as when the happy soil of their cultivation is previously fenced by the establishment of FRANKPLEDGE with a due prac∣tical knowledge of NATURAL AND REVEALED RE∣LIGION the two  first foundations of English law  con∣trary to which no  custom maxim  or even  statute  can be  legal  according to the  common law  of England which is only  common sense  improved by the written revelation of GOD'S LAWS in the Holy Scriptures  So indispensable to the constitution of England was FRANKPLEDGE deemed by our ancestors that they justly required "THE VIEW OF FRANKPLEDGE" by an express article of their  great charter  chap  to be at the feast of St Michael without occa∣sion  i e without waiting for any other circum∣stance to authorise the view than the mere annual return of Michaelmas the usual season of holding it And "THE TRYTHING" by the same high au∣thority is required to  "be wholly kept"  or  main∣tained entire as it used to be    trithing a teneatur  integra sicut esse consuevit  because the efficacy of FRANKPLEDGE in the ready administration o  justice without expence depends chiefly on holding "THE TRYTHING" which is the monthly COUR  LEET of  "three or more hundreds"  joined together or more generally THE COURT LEET  of a third pa  of a shire or  RIDING derived from TRYTHING  See Camden's Britannia Bishop Gibson's edition p  As the word  riding  is allowed to be derived from  trything  i  very probable that  ruding  has also the same etymology See also  "Leges Edwardi Regis"  cap de TRITHINGIS LEDIS  and as both FRANKPLEDGE and the TRYTHING are thus expresly required by MAGNA CHARTA they may lawfully be established wherever a  legal English government  is maintained without any farther au∣thority than the vote or agreement of a majority of the  householders  in each district  GRANVILLE SHARP  EXTRACT OF A  LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR  TO A GENTLEMAN IN THE EAST INDIES  FROM some late determinations in the courts of Bengal against Slave Dealers and oppressors of the poor labouring natives accounts of which have been published in our English newspapers the Public here in general are well satisfied that the poor natives in India are  free  and receive  wages for their labour  And consequently all the most steady friends to the measure of  abolishing the Slave Trade  are solicitous to promote the use and sale of  East India Sugar  in preference to that which is cultivated  by Slaves  elsewhere So that you may be assured that the  Sugar Trade from India  may be immensely increased and the value of the newacquired lands in India may be amply advanced for the benefit of the Hon East India Company or of the proprietors of East Indian lands in general if due care be taken by the Company's agents and servants to satisfy Europeans that the East India Sugar continues to be really the produce of  free labour  And care must also be taken to prevent  West Indian  adventurers or others from forming plantations in any of the newacquired  Indian lands now become British territory on any other plan than that of  free labour  that the baneful and iniquitous practice of  exacting la∣bour without wages  may be effectually prevented and be duly deemed as detestable among men as it is certainly abominable in the sight of God All imposing contracts for labour should also be vigilantly guarded against by the administrators of government in the several Indian departments for next after the  abolition of the Slave Trade  and  Slavery  the most important consideration certainly is how to place the poor labouring natives of India in such a happy state of permanent establish∣ment as may insure to them a general subsistence independent of the caprice and injustice of mono∣polizers and the grasping speculations of merce∣nary adventures and yet with such moderation in this little elevation of their condition that they may still feel sufficient inducement to prompt their  industry  for the public good To this point I have lately turned my thoughts and have reason to think that it may easily be effected not only to the advantage and security of the industrious poor and to the general promotion of trade in the numerous articles which the labourers by  little elevation of their condition will be enabled to purchase but also at the same time to th  very great advantage and profit of the rich  I mean those that have much  landed property  and have thereby the power of carrying such a plan into execution For by granting a very small propor∣tion  of their lands to industrious labourers upon the conditions I have proposed in the inclosed paper they will be enabled  to raise the value of all the rest of their lands  For by this means they will never be at a loss either for  free labourers  to cultivate whatever parts of their estates they shall chuse to continue in their own hands or for a sufficient number of wellknown people among them of approved industry that may be  trusted to contract as renters  for the cultivation of the remainder of their estates in small portions or farms suited to their respective abilities and at their own risque And by the same means I am persuaded the value of the newacquired lands in India may be exceedingly enhanced as well for the advantage of the natives as for the Hon East India Company and of all their agents and servants in case the latter should be per∣mitted to realize their fortunes acquired in India by investments of  landed property  purchased either of the Company or of the native proprietors especially as the increasing demand for  East Indian Sugar  affords great encouragement for cultivating lands in India and there are many other branches of husbandry hitherto neglected in India as the planting of  sago trees  and a variety of other va∣luable  productive vegetables  which would enrich the occupiers of land and amply assord a due compence to the industrious labourers  I am aware however that my proposal in the  nclosed paper of establishing  Frankpledge  among  the  Indian nations  will be charged with objections too commonly deemed  insuperable  by Europeans that have dwelt among them and who therefore ought to be best acquainted with their dispositions The inveterate prejudices of the Gentoos con∣cerning the imaginary inscrutable antiquity of the Braminical traditions and their supposed  unalienable  attachment to their religion will be alleged But how shall we venture to rely on the experience and consequent opinions of most of the Europeans that have lived among them in a point which they are so far from having attempt∣ed to investigate with candour that many of them through a lamentable neglect or ignorance of christianity and ancient history have rather been inclined blindly to adopt than to confute the ab∣surdities of Gentooism  One English gentleman though he is neither de∣ficient in understanding nor in experience and knowledge of the manners and dispositions of the Gentoos has very gravely informed us of a great similarity between the  Mosaical Laws  and those of the  Gentoos  But this gentleman whose be¦nevolent intentions I do not at all question or even suspect has not been sufficiently aware o  "the  mystery of iniquity  and the  working of Satan" the great  "deceiver of the nations"  For all  tru  religion is uniform in  righteousness  and in  justice▪  Whereas the code of laws which he has commend¦ed abounds with  injustice falsehood  and  cruel oppr  s∣sion of the poor  though some faint traces of  justice  an  morality  may seem to be dispersed among these laws for the more easy seduction of indiscriminate people as  Satan will always endeavour to appear as an Angel of Light  and all his votaries wear a mask of very opposite features from those that are hid by it But some even of the very laws which are included in this gentleman's publica∣tion and which are thereby exposed to the light of truth and common sense afford ample confu∣tation of his own remark for by these it appears that  the Gentoo laws  proceed by a  sevenfold  pro∣portion of INEQUITY i e a  numerical perfection  of INIQUITY extorting from the poor  Sooders  fines of  seven times  the value that are required of the Bramins for  the very same offences  though the  Laws of God  declared by Moses to which they have been very injudiciously compared absolutely prohibit  any respect of persons in judgment  And notwithstanding the pretended  mildness  of these laws yet the cloven foot is apparent for the Sooder is doomed to be  burned alive  for  fornication  with a Bramin woman even though she should have been proved the first seducer whereas the Bramin for the abominable and irreparable injury to a female Sooder even of a  violent rape  is let off for a  small fine  And this detestable and enormous iniquity is even established by an ac∣knowledged law Nay there is an express law to insure to the  Bramins  the gross privilege which they claim for the indulgence of their lust that  it is lawful for a Bramin to tell a lie to deceive a  woman  And yet with all these  abominable  pri∣vileges bad as they are their iniquity is still aggravated by the  blasphemous  falsehood that their deceitful cast  proceeded from the mouth of the Creator other casts from inferior parts of his body and the Sooders from the soles of his fect  Satan could not suggest a more malicious calumny against the  divine justice  It is so evident a token of  "the mystery of iniquity  and  "working of Satan"  that we need not search farther in the  Gentoo Laws  for the declared  "Doctrines of De∣mons"  the two revealed marks of  "the mystery of iniquity"  by which Christians are warned to know  "the man of sin"  or    the lawless one  that was to prevail in the Roman Empire in the  latter times  viz  "forbidding to marry"  and  com∣manding to abstain from meats  c  though the poor Gentoos are also grievously injured and de∣luded by the  last  of these marks For as the inter∣position of  "deluding spirits"  is manifested in the apostate church of the Roman Empire by the open assumption of a  pagan title of priesthood  PONTIFEX and still more especially by that most presumptuous title of pretended  infallibility  and  universal dominion  PONTIFEX MAXIMUS through which this dangerous usurper of unli∣mited power under the masque of religion be∣came the  true "image of the beast"  the former IMPERIAL PONTIFICES or  Heathen Emperors  who did not more haughtily suppress the natural rights of mankind than did their successors the PAPAL  PONTIFICES in proclaiming  Crusades  and in ex∣citing lawless Princes to wage  bloody  and  destruc∣tive  wars against all persons that opposed their  image  worship and other  antichristian  corruptions and in establishing bloody  inquisitions  to maintain this horrible tyranny So the same unnatural  in∣terposition  may as evidently be traced to its  spiritual  source by the baneful fruits and bloody track of  inquisitorial  cruelty and tyranny manifested in the Laws of the Bramins lately published as the  cutting off the  buttock of a Sooder  for  sitting on the carpet of a Bramin  the  cramming a redhot iron  into their mouths for repeating any words of the Beads or Shaster  and the  pouring hot wax into their ears  for sitting to hear them read If the Beads contained any good it would be con∣summate  Popery  thus to prohibit the communi∣cation of what is  good from the vulgar  like the universal prohibition of the Scriptures in the ver∣nacular tongues wherever  the beast  prevails But there can be no doubt if the Sooders were duly protected by government from the fear of such  frightful penalties  that they would not be back∣ward to acknowledge their  just and equal claims  to  all the rights of mankind  And I need only men∣tion  these severe laws  as ample and sufficient proofs to confute the prejudices of gentlemen infallibly experienced as they suppose by their residence in India respecting the imaginary  unalienable  attach∣ment of the Hindoos to their false religion for unless the Bramins themselves had known that the  other Hindoos were  much inclined  to think them∣selves  equally men  with the Bramins and to be thereby entitled to all  equal rights  and  natural justice  they would not have disgraced their code of laws with such enormities  Frankpledge  is the only safe mode of restoring these poor people to their  just rights  and it was necessary for me  thus far  to guard against the obvious objections that would be made by many gentlemen who presume much on their own experimental knowledge of the Gentoos  I remain with sincere esteem DEAR SIR Your affectionate friend And obliged humble servant G S
