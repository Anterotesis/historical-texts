 A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THE DESIGN AND ADVANTAGES OF THE  SouthSea  Trade WITH ANSWERS to all the OBJECTIONS rais'd against it A List of the  Commodities  proper for that  Trade  And the Progress of the  Subscription  towards the SOUTHSEA Company  LONDON  Printed and Sold by  J Morphew  near  StationersHall  Price Six Pence  A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THE  SOÆ²THSEA  Trade  c  Great Debts of the Nation  _IT is but too Notorious That the Debts of the Nation which at Her Majesty's happy Accession to the Throne were very Great instead of being lessen'd were rather accumulated to an immense Degree when this present Parliament began their first Session  Necessity to satisfie them to restore Publick Credit  Without invidiously tracing up this Evil to its Causes either primary or subordinate it must be agreed on all Hands that there lay a Duty incumbent on the Parliament and Ministry to apply to it a speedy Remedy Without which Publick Credit must have had such a Fall as might have drawn after it if not the Ruin of the State at least of a vast Number of private Persons  Difficulties to do it during the War  When a Man seriously consider'd That the Nation has for near Twenty Years sustain'd the Weight of Two Burdensome expensive Wars the second of which is yet unfinish'd and must of Necessity be carry'd on with the utmost Vigour and reflected besides that some of the best old Funds were clogg'd with Mortgages and Anticipations and that some New ones had prov'd  Deficient  there appear'd insuperable Difficulties in satisfying Publick Debts  Removed by the Ministry and Parliament  But the Wisdom and Skill of the Ministry and the Honesty of the Parliament have surmounted all Obstacles  The First Step they made was like able Physicians to probe the Wound and inform themselves of all the Circumstances of the Evil they undertook to Cure  Having by this Means come to a perfect Knowledge of the Debts of the Nation and found that they amounted to about Nine Millions Sterling which 'twas altogether impossible to discharge whilst the War lasted  Provision made for the Payment of an Interest on all Publick Debit  They made however Provision for the Payment of the Interest at the Rate of Six  per Cent  for ever redeemable by Parliament Which considering the Goodness of the Security and the Exemption of Publick Taxes may in Time prove more advantageous to the respective Creditors than  the actual Payment of the Capital Sum  Advantage allow'd to the Proprietors of those Debts by Incorporating them to carry on a Trade to the  SouthSeas    Besides this Provision for the Interest at Six  per Cent  of all the National Debts the Parliament readily gave into a Project formed with great Wisdom and Publick Spirit by the Prime Minister for Incorporating the Proprietors of the said Debts to carry on a  Trade to the SouthSeas  Whereby a further Advantage will in all Probibility accrue to the said Proprietors and through their Means to the Whole Nation  We have hitherto made War for Honour's sake  For we may here observe That hitherto we seem to have been Fighting like  KnightErrants  for  Honour's sake  and to redress Publick Grievances without any Regard to our private Interest Thus instead of making a good Use either of the Necessities and Streights of the House of  Austria  or of the Misfortunes of the Common Enemy as the Duke of  Savoy  in the first Case and the  Dutch  in the second have wisely done we have even neglected the Pursuit of those advantageous Conditions on which we enter'd into the Grand Alliance  viz  That we should remain Masters of such as we should possess our selves of in the  WestIndies  during the Course of the War to be undertaken for the Recovery of the  Spanish  Dominions  On the other Hand 'tis melancholy to reflect That  France  notwithstanding all the Difficulties she has struggled with notwithstanding those repeated Disgraces that have attended her Arms and given such terrible Shocks to her Power has yet got a Handle to compass her main Design  viz  The  Engrossing all the Wealth of the  WestIndies Which if not prevented will not only repair all her former Losses but enable her to arrive at Universal Empire in  Europe    Settlements of the  French  in  America    All the World knows that upon Occasion of taking Possession of  OldSpain  for King  Philip  and other specious Pretences the  French  took also Possession of great Part of  NewSpain  Pretending to put it into a Posture of Defence which indeed they have done but too well having in particular built a strong Fort at  Calo  that secures the Entrance to the wealthy City of  Lima  and they have improved this Possession to the infinite Advantage of  France  in an open Trade to the  Spanish WestIndies  directly a Thing they never attempted before  At which the  Spaniards  were uneasie  The  Spaniards  could not without Jealousy and Uneasiness see the Increase of the  French  Trade and Power in  America  So that at last the Chamber of  Commerce in  Sevil  made earnest Application to King  Philip  to put a Stop to it That Prince represented to his GrandFather the absolute Necessity of yielding to the Importunities of the  Spanish  Merchants back'd by the powerfull Sollicitations of the Nobility but the  French  King who was resolv'd not to abandon the Trade to  America  contented himself with causing it to be publickly declar'd in  Spain  That his Subjects should be recall'd from the  Spanish WestIndies  and that the Trade thither should return to its old proper Channel and at the same Time contrary to this Declaration that Politick Monarch conniv'd at if not directed the sending of several Ships more than usual to the  SouthSeas  with Cannon Mortars Arms Ammunition Officers Soldiers and Ingeniers to put the several Ports of  Peru  and  Chili  in a Posture of Defence in order to keep Possession of them by Force in Case the  Spaniards  should insist on the Removing the  French  from their Settlements on that Coast  But succeeding Events prevented the further Importunities of the  Spaniards  on that Head and rather favour'd the Designs of the Court of  France  who made a very politick Use of King  Philip  's Misfortunes For the  Spanish  Army  being routed at  Almenara  and soon after totally defeated near  Saragossa  upon the Application the Grandees of  Spain  made to the  French  King for immediate Assistance it was required from them That they should give their solemn Consent to the new Treaty of Alliance then agitating between the Two Crowns whereby very advantageous Concessions were made to the  French  in the  WestIndies  Which through the desperate Condition of their Affairs the Grandees were oblig'd to agree to By this Treaty the  French  retain several Forts and Fortifications and being planted over the whole Kingdom of  Chili  they have at this Time several Ships of Force Trading in those Seas which come Home with rich Cargoes from at least to  l Ster  in Silver  By this Means the  French  have laid a Foundation not only to keep  OldSpain  in a perpetual Dependance upon them by depriving them of that Commerce in which their Riches and Subsistence mainly consist but also if not speedily prevented to supplant all the rest of the World in the Beneficial Trade to  Old  and  NewSpain  and to encrease the Wealth and Power of  France  to such a Degree as which I hinted before in  Process of Time to put that ambitious Crown in a Condition to give Laws to  Europe  and to revive her lately baffled Project of an  Universal Monarchy  It is certain at least that as the Trade to the  Spanish WestIndies  is the present Support of our Enemies so consequently as long as they preserve that Trade there's little Possibility of bringing this necessary but expensive War to a safe and honourable Conclusion  The  French  must be removed from the  WestIndies    We may therefore lay down this Political Axiom or Maxim that  The  French  must be remov'd from their Settlements in the  Spanish WestIndies  as the most effectual Means both to procure a lasting Peace and to settle the Grand Trade and Wealth of  Europe  on a due Ballance    The  Spaniards  wish to do it but can't therefore we must undertake it  Tho' the  Spaniards  have it undoubtedly in their wishes yet 'tis beyond Dispute that they are not like ever to have it in their Power to drive the  French  out of  SouthAmerica  And as next to the  Spaniards  we are the most concern'd in that Undertaking so we ought to exert our utmost Power to accomplish it  This was the main Design in Eresting the  SouthSea  Company  Upon this wise Consideration it was that the Ministry and Parliament thought fit to incorporate the Proprietors of the ArmyDebentures NavyBills DeficientTallies and other Publick Debts to  carry on a Trade to the  SouthSeas  Which Corporation when form'd and regulated will have the largest Stock of any TradingCompany in the whole World and therefore will be best able with a Small Contribution of each Proprietor the concurrent Assistance of the National Shipping and LandForces and other Advantages that shall be Specified in their Charter to dislodge the  French  from the  Spanish WestIndies  or at least to make Settlements there and carry on a Trade most benefical to the said Corporation and to the whole  British  Nation  This Undertaking no new Project  It rather adds to than derogates from the Honour and Praise due to the Great Genius who brought this Undertaking so near Execution to observe that the vast Advantages that will attend its Success are so obvious that a Project not unlike this was form'd above Fourscore Years ago as appears by a remarkable Speech made by Sir  Benjamin Rudyerd  at a Committee of the Whole House of Commons in the Parliament  Jac  about a  WestIndiaAssociation  which was to the Effect following  Sir  Benjamin Rudyerd  's Speech at a Committee of the Whole House of Commons  Jac  Anno  Sir Dudley Digs  'I do profess that as my Affection my Reason and my Judgment go strongly with the Scope and Drift of  this Proposition so shall a good Part of my poor Fortune when it comes to Execution'  'For to my Understanding there was never propounded in Parliament a Design more proper for this Kingdom nor of more pregnant Advantage to it whether we consider the nature of our Scituation or the Quality of our Enemy's Forces'  'As we are an Island it concerns our very Being to have Store of Ships to defend us and also our Wellbeing by their Trade to enrich us'  'This Association for the  WestIndies  when it shall be regulated and establish'd by Act of Parliament and thereby secured from the Violence and injury of  any intruding hand  will certainly give many Men Encouragement and Confidence voluntarily to bring in large and liberal Contributions towards so  Noble  so  Profitable  an  Enterprise  So that in short time we shall see many new Ships built many brave Men employ'd and enabled for the Service of their Country None of this Money shall be carried out of the Kingdom but laid out for Shipping which is the Defence of it and bestow'd upon our own Men who must be fed and maintain'd tho' they stay at Home For this  we shall reap the Fruit of whatsoever  Benefit Plantation Traffick  or  Purchase  can procure us besides  Honour  and  Security  '  'Now let us a little consider the Enemy we are to encounter the King of  Whatever was then said of the King of  Spain  may in the main be now applied to the  French  King  Spain  They are not his great Territories which make him so powerful and so troublesome to all Christendom For it is very well known that  Spain  it self is but weak in Men and barren of natural Commodities As for his other Territories they lye divided and asunder which is a weakness in it self Besides they are held by Force and maintain'd at an extraordinary Charge Insomuch as altho' he be a great King yet he is like that Gyant who was said to have a Hundred Hands but he had Bellies to feed so that ratably he had no more Hands than another Man'  'No Sir they are his MINES in the WESTINDIES which Minister Fuell to feed his vast  ambitious Desire  of UNIVERSAL MONARCHY It is the Money he hath from thence which makes him able to levy and pay Soldiers in all Places and to keep an Army continually on foot ready to invade and indanger his Neighbours'  'So that we have no other way but  to endeavour to cut him off at Root and seek to impeach or to  Supplant  him in the  WestIndies  By part of which Course that Famous Queen of most Glorious Memory had heretofore almost brought him on his Knees And this our Undertaking if it please God to bless it must needs effect it sooner and quicker the whole Body of the Kingdom being United and concurring in a  perpetual Supply  to this Action so that he will have no free Time given him to rest'  'Moreover this will be a Means not only to save but to fill his Majesty's Coffers enabling the People to give him liberally and often the King's Ships will have little to do but to guard the Coasts for the SeaWar will chiefly be made at the Charge of the Subject Thus Sir  Dudley Digs  I doubt not but that in a short Time both King and People shall be safe at Home and fear'd Abroad To conclude I shall be very glad to hear any Man make  Objections  against this  Design  so that he do it with an Intention to retine and perfect the Work but if any shall speak against it with a Mind to hinder and destroy it I must entreat him to pardon me if I do scarce think him to be a GOOD ENGLISHMAN'  The Project of a  SouthSea  Trade laid before King  William    About the Middle of King  William  's Reign a Project of much the same Nature as this was also laid before his Majesty who highly approv'd of it and would have pursued it had he not been diverted from it either by the short and SelfInterested Views of some Persons about him or by the Contradictions he met with in most of his PublickSpirited Undertakings However being informed by Father  Hennepin  who was introduc'd to his Majesty and dedicated to him the Account of his Voyages and Travels in the  WestIndies  That the  French  were at that Time endeavouring to lay a Foundation to engross the Trade thither by Means of a Communication between the River  Canada  and that of  Missisippi  which empties itself into the Gulf of  Mexico  His Majesty upon the Decease of the King of  Spain  resolved to pursue the Scheme beforemention'd In Order to that Commodore  Bembow  was sent with a strong Squadron to the  WestIndies  to both intercept the  Spanish  Galleons and to countenance some Attempts intended to be made on the  Spanish  Settlements in  America  and of which History has preserv'd us the following Particulars  Annals of Q  Anne    Vol  p  'About the Beginning of  February  Letters from  PortRoyal  in  Jamaica  brought the  Melancholy  News of the Death of that brave and experienc'd SeaOfficer Rear Admiral  Bembow  who upon the th of  December  Died of the Wound he receiv'd in his late Engagement with Monsieur  Du Casse  c  Successes of the  English  in  America  in the Year  These Letters added Not long after his Death Colonel  Robert Daniel  arriving at  PortRoyal  from  Carolina  brought an Account that Collonel  Moore  Governour of that Plantation march'd from  CharlesTown  in  Carolina  with Men in order to attack a Colony of the  Spaniards  about Miles distant call'd St  Augustine  near the Gulph of  Florida  that he soon possess'd himself of the Town the Inhabitants deserting it and retiring with their best Effects into a Strong Castle surrounded by a very deep and broad Moat in which Place they had laid up Provisions enough to last them four Months and that they defended themselves there very obstinately so it being impossible to take this Castle by Storm Colonel  Moore  had order'd it to be Block'd up and sent Colonel  Daniel  to  PortRoyal  to borrow a Mortar and StoneShells to Bombard it and doubted not but he should by that means soon force them to surrender If this Expedition had succeeded it would have greatly Contributed  to the Security of  Carolina  there being no other Place from whence they could afterwards be disturb'd except a small Settlement which the  French  call the  Palissadoes  about Miles farther into the Country to the Westward But some  French  and  Spanish  Galleons being arriv'd at St  Augustine  's Port before the return of Colonel  Daniel  Colonel  Moore  was obliged to raise the Blockade and to return to his Government by Land after having Burnt the Ship in which he was come The Same Letters brought advice that Six or Eight Frigates of our small Privateers attack'd a Place call'd  Toulon  on the Continent about Leagues from  Carthagena  which they Took Plunder'd and Burnt From thence they sail'd to  Caledonia  went up the River  Darien  and in Twelve Days March to the Gold Mines at  Santa Cruz de Cana  near  Santa Maria  The th Day of their March they fell within an OutGuard of Ten Men which the  Spaniards  had at some Distance from the Place of whom they took Nine but the other Escaping gave Notice at the Mines of their approach whereupon the richest of the Inhabitants retir'd from thence with their Money and Jewels however our Party which  Consisted of about Four Hundred Men being come up Took the Fort and possess'd themselves of the Mine where there remain'd  Negroes  whom they set to Work and continued there Days in which time they got about Pound weight of Gold Dust they also found several Parcels of Plate which the Inhabitants had buried at their leaving that Place Our Men at their Departure burnt all the Town except the Church and return'd to their Sloops bringing away the  Negroes  Some went further up the River in their Sloops having a Design upon another Gold Mine call'd  Chocoa  and two of the Sloops commanded by Captain  Plowman  and Captain  Grandy  sail'd toward  Cuba  landed near  Trinidado  and with Men took the Town burnt a great part of it and brought off a very considerable Booty'  K  William  's Project resumed by Q  Anne    Not long after Her Majesty's happy Accession to the Throne some Advances were made towards the Prosecution of King  William  's Project  The Lords pass an Act to encourage it  in Order to which the Lords pass'd a Bill entitled  An Act for the better Carrying on the present War by Sea and Land in the  WestIndies which the Commons read a second Time on the th of  February  and committed the same to a  Grand Committee  Which is lost  but two Days after  February  th upon a Debate arising about the Speaker's leaving the Chair to consider of the said Bill the Debate was adjourn'd to the th of that Month and the Parliament being prorogu'd the th that Bill was lost  The  Dutch  forward in the intended Expedition  Nevertheless the Court seem'd still resolv'd upon an Expedition to the  West Indies  in Conjunction with the  Dutch  under the Command of the Earl of  Peterborow  And there's no Doubt to be made that if that Resolute and Pushing General had carried our  Victorious Forces  and his  Good Fortune  to the  WestIndies  instead of going to  Spain  the Enemy would long before now have been obliged to submit to the Conditions of a safe and lasting Peace But tho' the  Dutch  were very earnest and forward in this intended Expedition having for that purpose sent a Squadron with LandMen on Board to  Portsmouth  in the Beginning of the Spring of the Year  Which however is laid aside  Yet either as 'twas reported upon a Disgust given to that Noble Peer by refusing him several Necessaries or for some other Reasons that Undertaking was then laid aside  The Design reviv'd and brought to Perfection by the present Ministry  This Design lay dormant for about Eight Years till the  Scheme  of it was NewModell'd and digested into better Consistency  and Form by the Present Ministry who did wisely Incorporate the Proprietors of Publick Debts to carry it on  Advantages resulting from a Settlement in the  SouthSeas    The Settlements which the  British  Corporation are allow'd to make in the  SouthSeas  both by the Treaty of the GrandAlliance and by Act of Parliament will certainly be attended with infinite Advantages  The Trade of such Places as we shall Seize and Plant will by Degrees encrease both within it self and with others and will open such a Vein of Riches will return such Wealth as in few Years will make us more than sufficient Amends for the vast Expences we have been at since the Revolution  For it will occasion a great Consumption of our Woollen Iron and other Manufactures as will be hereunder specified  Consequently it will find Work and Employment for Abundance of our Poor and thereby ease the Parishes of that heavy Burden  It will advance the Value of Land  It will increase our Shipping and the Number of our Sea Men in both which the chief and natural Strength of this Nation consists  Our Settling in  SouthAmerica  may open a beneficial Trade for our Plantations in  NorthAmerica  who want a Market for the Overplus of those Provisions that grow in those Countries  The  SouthSea  Trade may greatly contribute towards the buoying up and supporting the sinking and near expiring Royal  African  Company by affording it an Opportunity of Vending great Numbers of  Negroes  to the  Spaniards  who by a Contract with the  Jamaicans  did formerly buy them at the Rate of Pieces of Eight ahead As an illustration of this it may be observ'd That the chief Motive that engag'd the  French  in the Attempt they made some Years ago upon the Islands of  Nevis  and St  Christopher's  was the Alluring Booty of the  Negroes  on those Plantations The  French  King having borrow'd a great Sum from the  Spaniards  upon Condition of Furnishing them with a certain Number of  Negroes  which he could not have perform'd but for the successful Invasion of the said Island  In the Last Place though it was not thought consistent with the Honour of the Nation to grant the Pirates of  Madagascar  a Pardon yet since they have establish'd and form'd themselves into a kind of regular Government it  will not be more dishonourable for the  SouthSea  Company to trade with them than it was for the People of  Italy  to hold a Commerce and friendly Correspondence with the First Founders of Old  Rome  who were but a Company of Publick Robbers It may indeed be alledg'd That the  SouthSea  Corporation is not allow'd to trade in  Madagascar  which would be an Incroachment on the  EastIndia  Company but as the Act of Parliament only limits Places and not Persons so the  SouthSea  Company may within the Limitations of the Act carry on a very beneficial Commerce with the  Madagascarians  who drive themselves a considerable Trade in the  SouthSeas  either in a  Friendly  or a  Piratical  Manner  And here it may not be improper to subjoin the Account which in the Year was given of the Pirates of  Madagascar  which was as follows  Account of the Wealth of the Pirates in  Madagascar  and of what they offer'd for their Pardon  'Captain  Wheeler  Captain  Brent  and Dr  Dawsone  who was within the Limitation of King  William  's Proclamation and had the Benefit of the same as also Captain  Hicks  and others that were condemn'd for Piracy but Pardon'd by Her present Majesty as also Captain  Brown  and  Peter Dearlove  who were bail'd out of Prison did all  give the following Account of the Number and Wealth of the Pirates to Captain  Martin Laycock  and did assure him That if he could get a General Pardon without Exception of Crimes Persons or Places as also Liberty for their Effects they could bring him to full Fifteen Hundred Men that would willingly give one Fourth Part of what they were worth and that one with another they had full l a Man'  Captain  Avery  's Crew was then at  l  each Man is    l  Captain  Read  's Crew was Men who shared at one Time  l  at another Time  l  at another Time  l  and at another Time  l  each Man which to each Man amounts to  l  in all    l  Capt  Thomas Tongs  's Crew consisted of Men worth full  l  each Man he being a  WestIndian  born and one of the boldest and forwardest of them all Worth in all    l  Total    l  Captain  Avery  Capt  Read  and Capt  Tongs  were reckon'd to be worth each as much as their entire respective Crews  viz    l  And the Officers under them were accounted to be worth about Three Millions more    l  In All    l  'Besides Captain  Brown  's Crew and others in the  SouthSeas  and those that go between  Madagascar  and the  WestIndies  whom they could give no certain Account of to Captain  Laycock  but who they were sure would readily give the Fourth Part of what they were worth for their Pardon so that by a modest Computation the Fourth Part of the whole would bring in above Six Millions Sterling to the Government'  Thus far the Account of the  Madagascarians  given in  Upon the whole Matter the real Advantages of this Trade will with God's Blessing abundantly answer the Charge and Expectation both of the private Adventurers and of the whole Nation  Commodities proper for a Trade to the  SouthSeas    A LIST

the Undertaking be Noble Great and Advantageous yet such is the Perversness of Humane Nature so prone are the Generality of Men to Censure and find Fault that 'tis no Wonder this PublickSpirited Design has met with Contradiction and Opposition either from a Jealousie and Uneasiness of Temper almost inseparable from Money'dMen or from the Particular Disgusts of some Persons who like Waspish and Sullen Patients reject the most Wholesome Physick because they are not pleas'd with the Hand that administers it  First Objection  In the first Place it is objected That considering what strong Footing the  French  have got in the  Spanish WestIndies  the Attempt to remove them from thence is like to be attended with insuparable Difficulties the rather because they are in Conjunction with the  Spaniards  both at Land and Sea And supposing we could get some Settlement in the Continent of  SouthAmerica  yet while the War lasts we could Trade with no more of the Country than we possess unless it be clandestinely and after the Peace we must expect to have less Trade whereas the  French  have an open uninterrupted Commerce with the whole Country  Answer to the First Branch of it  As to the first Branch of this Objection I answer That the Necessity of driving the  French  out of the  Spanish WestIndies  being once laid down as a Fundamental Maxim no Difficulties whatsoover ought to deterr us from the Undertaking whereas on the contrary the infinite Advantage and Benefit that will attend the Success of the Attempt ought to be a powerful Incentive to it We have in the Course of this War with our Shipping and a Handful of LandMen compass'd Things of far greater Difficulty such as the Taking of  Barcelona Gibraltar  and  PortMahon  And to bring in a fresher Instance did not Colonel  Nicholson  with inconsiderable Forces make himself Master of  PortRoyal  in  Nova Scotia  which we may well suppose was in a better Posture of Defence than several Places in  SouthAmerica  in which the  French  are but newly settled  Besides can any Man of common Sense entertain so mean an Opinion of those who made this Project and have thereby justly merited publick Acknowledgments and Rewards as to think that they did not foresee and provide against all Difficulties that might attend it There's no Doubt to be made but the Ministry have had all the Lights and  Informations necessary to carry on so great an Undertaking with Probability of Success But the  Scheme  they have framed with the Assistance of several Persons who are perfectly well acquainted with those Countries is and ought to remain an absolute Secret till all Things be ready for Execution otherwise the Enemy might take such Measures and Precautions as might render the Design abortive  Answer to the second Branch of the First Objection  To the Second Part of the First Objection I answer That by a Trade to the  SouthSeas  it is not to be understood that we shall take Possession of some Ports or Places on the Westside of  SouthAmerica  which being to be allow'd as our Acquisitions pursuant to the Treaty of the GrandAlliance beforemention'd We shall possess the same after the Peace is made and that from these Places we shall carry on a Free Trade with the  Spaniards  and Natives of  America  throughout the rest of their Plantations as the  French  do now To be sure to expect such a  Free Trade  would be a fond Conceit For as during the War the  French  in Conjunction with the  Spaniards  will certainly endeavour to prevent it so after the Peace  OldSpain  will not easily consent to it The same Reasons that induc'd  them notwithstanding their inbred Antipathy to the  French  rather to call the Duke of  Anjou  to the Throne than to suffer a Partition of their Monarchy will undoubtedly incline them not to acquiesce in a  Partition of their Direct American  Trade which as was hinted before is the main spring of their Riches and would in Effect be the same with a  Partition of their Dominions    But the Trade intended to be carried on by the  British  Corporation to the  SouthSeas  will be so far from being Prejudicial to the  Spaniards  that as we may with God's Blessing during the War deliver them from the intruding  French  of whom as I hinted before they wish themselves to be rid So in Time of Peace our Settlements in the  SouthSeas  will rather be an Advantage than a Detriment to  OldSpain  This Position may at first Blush look like a Paradox But as 'tis most certain That there's room enough on the WesternCoast of  SouthAmerica  for us to plant and establish a flourishing Trade in without invading the Property or injuring the Original Commerce of the  Spaniards  so on the other Hand we may assist them in carrying on the said Trade by supplying them with what they stand most in need of for that Purpose  viz Negroes  which we may easily do with no finall Advantage to our selves as was before mentioned By this it appears That the  Spaniards  have no Reason to be  'd but rather to rejoyce at and favour our Undertaking Since the Old Treaty of Commerce between  England  and  Spain  of which the exclusive Article was with Respect to  NewSpain  may yet with Exception only to such Places as we may possess our selves of during the War remain entire after the Peace notwithstanding our  South Sea  Trade  And here we may cursorily take Notice That besides the Concessions made to us by the Treaty of the Grand Alliance of such Places as we shall possess in the  Spanish  Dominions in  America    Our Title to  California    we have also a Right to the great Island of  California  as having been first Discover'd by our CountryMan Sir  Francis Drake  A Title of equal Validity with any Pretensions of other  European  Princes or States to any Part of the  West  or  EastIndies  And that Island lying to the NorthWest of  Mexico  may be of great Advantage to us towards the carrying on and improvement of the  SouthSea  Trade  d Objection  In the Second Place The vast Distance  between  England  and the  SouthSeas  is alledg'd as a great Obstacle to the Success of this Undertaking  Answer'd  But this Objection will appear to be of no Weight if we consider That by the Benefit of our Ports in  Ireland  we are as to that Particular upon a Level with the  French  and in several other Respects we have great Advantages over them as in the Strength of Shipping Number of SeaMen Ports on the Coast of  Africa  and in our  American  Plantations particularly in  Jamaica  c  d Objection  A Third Outery has by some ill designing People been rais'd against this Project as if the Parliament intended to pay all National Debts with the  floating Expectations  of a  precarious SouthSea  Trade  Confuted  Than which nothing can be more maliciously or more falsly suggested For the Parliament has provided an Interest of Six  per Cent  which will be punctually paid till the Nation be in a Condition to redeem the same by paying off the Capital Sum And the  SouthSea  Corporation as was hinted before was erected only as an  Additional  Advantage both to the Proprietors of the said Debts and through their Means to the whole Nation  th Objection  But the loudest most popular and indeed most plausible Clamour against this Undertaking is the  Cumpulsion  put upon the Proprietors of Publick Debts to subscribe thier Tallies Debentures Bills  c  into this New Company As if the whole Debt was to be the Stock in Trade and this Stock was to be employ'd towards the Dislodging the  French  out of the  Spanish WestIndies  c  First Part of it answer'd  As to the First Part of this Objection I answer That between Man and Man to force a free Debtor to take an Interest for his Debt and not receive the Principal according to Contract is certainly very hard and unjust But the Case is vastly different between a Private Man and a Nation for the first may fail and prove insolvent the latter never can It is too visible that the Publick Debts were too Great to be paid off in any Number of Years while the Burden of an expensive War lies heavy upon the Nation and therefore all that an  Honest Parliament  and  Wise Ministry  could do was to secure those Debts by ascertaining them and putting them into one  Lump  and by allowing an Interest of Six  per Cent  that is as large an Interest as was ever allow'd by Parliament except upon extraordinary Emergencies and  One  per Cent  more than some of those Debts  viz  the  Army and TransportDebentures  had before So far the  Justice  and  Honour  of the Nation are clear and unblemish'd  On the other Hand the Parliament and Ministry upon a Contemplation of the absolute Necessity of Removing the  French  out of  SouthAmerica  in Order to attain a Safe Honourable and Lasting Peace and of the other great Advantages beforemention'd that will result from a  SouthSea Trade  resolv'd to erect a Company for that Purpose and thereupon  incorporated  the Proprietors of the Publick Debts who by reason of their large Stock are certainly the most able to carry on this Undertaking with Probability of Success Now if ever  Compulsion  can be justify'd and no Government can subsist without it it is certainly in a Case not only of Necessity but Visible Benefit The Forcing therefore the Proprietors of Publick Debts that is a Multitude of Persons of different Humours Interests and Views to agree and meet in one Common Center  viz  the Publick Good and their own Private Advantage is certainly a very happy and commendable Violence Not but that such a Compulsion may occasion Inconveniences to several particular Persons  But as  Salus Populi Suprema Lex  so  Private ought to yield to Publick Considerations    d Branch of the Fourth Objection answer'd  The Second Branch of the Fourth Objection is grounded either upon a Mistake or a false Suggestion For the  SouthSea  Company is not to make War and endeavour to dislodge the  French  out of the  Spanish WestIndies  at their own Sole Cost and Expence but only with the Assistance of the NationalNavy and LandForces as will be Specified in their Charter  th Objection  From the Fourth there arises a Fifth Objection  viz  That the Call for the Fishery being limited to Twenty Shillings upon every Hundred Pound and the Calls for the  SouthSea Trade  left Unstinted and Discretionary the Proprietors of the Publick Debts are justly apprehensive that great Sums of Money will be call'd in for carrying on the said Undertaking which has hitherto kept many of the said Proprietors from Subscribing  Answer'd  To this I answer First That the Company shall be at no further Charge than shall be thought necessary for their own Benefit and Advantage  Secondly That their CapitalStock being near Ten Millions Sterling a Call of Five Pound upon very Hundred Pound will raise near  l  a Sum much greater than the Capital JointStock with which the  French  King his GrandSon and the Subjects of the Two respective Crowns undertook and have Settled the Trade to the  SouthSea  and which was only of Six Millions of  French  Livers that is about  l  Sterling  Thirdly That according to Her Majesty's Charter all the several Calls towards the  SouthSea Trade  are not to exceed Ten Pound upon every Hundred Pound  Fourthly And in the last Place That the Company being under the Conduct and Management of a Governor and Directors who shall have the largest Share in the Adventure and consequently be most concern'd in the Prosperity of the Whole there's no Doubt to be made that if after such Tryals as are Necessary to be made in all great and difficult Undertakings they find that the  SouthSea  Trade will turn to no Account they will fairly throw it up and sit down contented with an Interest of Six  per Cent  for their CapitalStock till  the Parliament is in a Condition and thinks fit to redeem it For the Company is only  empower'd  and  not compell'd  to trade exclusive of all others to the SouthSeas which is so far from being a Hardship that it really is as it was meant a distinguishing Favour  False Report about the Subscription  And here we may take Notice of a false Report broach'd either through Mistake or a Sinister Design  viz  That a Fourth Part of the Subscription into this Company was to be made in ready Money which being inserted in one of the Publick Foreign Prints of the best Credit has undoubtedly hindred many Foreigners who are Proprietors of ArmyDebentures or other Publick Debts from Subscribing  Notwithstanding all Difficulties Four Millions were subscrib'd in Three Weeks  But notwithstanding these false Reports and Surmizes notwithstanding the malicious Endeavours and discouraging Suggestions of some  disgusted  on  illdesigning Persons  notwithstanding all the great Trouble that has unavoidably attended the Subscription such as the Examining the Title and casting up the broken Sums of every particular Bill and Debenture and other Difficulties yet 'tis very remarkable That in the few Days the Books were open which did not exceed Three Weeks near Four Millions were Subscrib'd  Two Millions more ready to be subscrib'd  To this if we add above Two Millions that are to be Subscrib'd for the Use of the Publick but which cannot be done till the Accounts of the several Offices are made up it may be computed that above Six Millions are as good as Subscrib'd and the greatest Part of the Three Millions and a Half remaining would have also come in had it not been for the Uncertainty of the Time when the  TransferrBooks  will be open'd which cannot be before the  CHARTER  of this Corporation has pass'd the  Seals  and the Remoteness from  Great Britain  of several Proprietors of the  Publick Debts  who could not have Time to send Orders to their Correspondents while the SubscriptionBooks were open'd  This great Undertaking brought so near Perfection one of the Wonders of this glorious Reign  So that the Bringing so great an Undertaking so near Perfection in so short a Time may well be reckon'd among the Wonders of Her Majesty's glorious Reign  To conclude Some Doubts that have arisen about some Clauses in the Act of Parliament for the erecting the  SouthSea  Corporation have fill'd the Minds of some of the Proprietors of the Publick Debts with illgrounded jealousies which may also have put some stop to the  Subscription  But as  'tis next to impossible That an Act of so vast  Magnitude  so comprehensive of  Publick Ends  and  Private Details  the Framing of which seem'd to require whole Years and which nevertheless was necessarily to be perfected in few Days should be altogether without  Flaws  Any Defects in the Act of Parliament will be rectify'd  So any Defects that may appear to be in it will be rectify'd pursuant to the Intent of the said Act  FINIS
