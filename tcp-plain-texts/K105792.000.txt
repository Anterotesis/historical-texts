 THE SCHOOL FOR ARROGANCE A  COMEDY  THE SCHOOL for ARROGANCE A  COMEDY  AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL COVENT GARDEN  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  THE SECOND EDITION  LONDON  PRINTED FOR G G J AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTERROW  M DCC XCI  PREFACE  THE Comedy of  Le Glorieux  by M Nericault Destouches is the basis on which  The School for Arrogance  has been formed From that I have taken the plan several of the characters and some of the scenes Difference of arrangement additional incidents and what I deem to be essential changes of character have all been introduced The Count has but little resemblance to the original Lucy and Mac Dermot none Lady Peckham is a new character and was first suggested by a friend who conceiving highly of the contrast which exists in life between the pride of rank and the pride of riches industriously sought to stimulate and rouse my imagination  The subject of the piece is greatly interesting to morals and highly worthy of the Theatre Conscious of the great effects a perfect Comedy might have produced I regret the imperfections of the present Some good it will do I regret that it cannot do more Persuaded as I am of the moral  dignity of the stage I cherish an enthusiastic wish to see the dramatic art surpass even all its former sublime efforts Among the pleasures of the imagination how frequently has its place been the first Happy indeed should I be could my success add the smallest impulse to the exertions of Genius ineffably happy would but this noble art once more boldly assert its rank and render itself not only the general love and delight of mankind but the veneration of the wise  It is with peculiar pleasure that I here acknowledge how much I am indebted to the conduct of Mr Marshal who in consequence of the prejudices which it was imagined Mr Harris laboured under respecting me acted for a time in my behalf as the author of the piece Though anxiously zealous for its success he still continued impartially attentive to the interests of all parties and sacrificed his own feelings to promote what he conceived to be a public good  The tribute of justice is also due to Mr Harris This tribute I am happy to have an opportunity to pay And that I may  now be consistent as I always have been in my private and public language to Mr Harris I will here insert a copy of a letter which I wrote to him when the comedy had been twice performed  SIR  I HAVE patiently waited the proper moment in which to write to you That moment I hope is now come I should be guilty of injustice were I any longer to delay expressing my sense of the propriety with which you have acted relatively to The School for Arrogance after you had every reason to suppose it mine Such conduct Sir is highly honourable and is not only productive of the best effects but must secure the best and most permanent applause That you had conceived disadvantageous ideas of me I knew though I have no doubt but I shall ultimately convince you that even supposing me to be mistaken my motives have been laudable *****  A single phrase which relates entirely to myself is here omitted  With me you were  irritated but you had the justice to forget the man and promote the interests of the piece This I hold it my duty to say to the world at large  I am Sir Your obliged humble servant  T HOLCROFT  Newman Street  Feb    To THOMAS HARRIS Esq  Mr Harris kindly expressed the satisfaction which his own private feelings received from this letter nor can there be a doubt but that the propriety of his conduct under such circumstances will be as agreeable to himself and as pleasing to the public as it has been to me  Newman Street  Feb    PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr BERNARD in the character of a Newshawker  After sounding and calling "Great news" without

him anonymously  Lydia  And why anonymously  Mr  Dor  To rouse his feelings wound his vanity and excite his anger His slumbering faculties must be awakenedIs he kind to you  Lydia  No Yet I believe him to be generous benevolent and noble of heart though his habitual haughtiness gives him the appearance of qualities the very reverse  Mr  Dor  Worthy kind girlYou were born for the consolation of a too unfortunate father  Lydia  Again you remind me that I have a father Why am I not allowed to see him Why am I not suffered to fly into his arms  Mr  Dor  He dreads lest his wretched and pitiable

father killed his antagonist whose enraged family by suborning witnesses caused him to be convicted of murder obliged him to fly the kingdom and with your mother wander under a borrowed name a fugitive in distant countries  Lydia  HeavensBut why leave me ignorant of my birth  Mr  Dor  That being unfortunate you might be humble that you might not grieve after happiness which you seemed

my father informs me an Exempt bribed by them has followed him to England  Edm  Impotent malice The laws will here protect him  Lydia  Oh Who can say The wicked cunning of such lifehunters is dreadfulI insist therefore upon your promise  Edm  My Angel Fear nothing  Kissing her hand  Enter  LUCY  unperceived  Lucy  Placing herself beside Edmund  Turn aboutNow me  Holding out her hand  Edm  Oh sister I am the happiest of men  Lucy  And you appear to be very busy too with your happiness  Edm  Did you but know  Lucy  Oh I know a great deal more than you suspectNot but you seem to be taking measures to inform the whole house  Edm  Of what  Lucy  Placing herself between them  That you two are never easy apart  Edm  SisterII must insist that you speak of this Lady withwith every respect  Lucy  Brother  Lydia  Edmund  Lucy  Looking first at one and then at the other  Strange enough this  Edm  Were I to tell you  Lydia  Aside and making signs  Very well  Lucy  Tell me whatWhy don't you tell me  Edm  Pshaw No noNothingII don't know what I am saying  Lucy  Why surely you don't imagine your fondness for each other is any secret  Edm  Sister I don't understandAre you narrowminded enough to suppose this young lady unworthy the hand of  Lucy  Of my brotherNoTo call my Lydia Sister  Taking her hand  is one of the things on earth I most fervently wish  Lydia  My generous friend  Edm  My charming girl  Lucy  Butthen  Edm  There are now no buts It will be an honourI say sister youyou don't knowIn short I must very earnestly solicit you to treat  Miss Lydia with all possible delicacyIII

Lydia  Oh no My heart throbs with an oppressive sense of your generous your affectionate attention to me  Lucy  OppressiveWell This is the proudest world  Lydia  Nay I didn't mean  Lucy  Oh No matter  Lydia  Have you had any conversation with the Count  Lucy  NoThere has been no opportunity yet todayI am really afraid his pride is quite as absurd as that of my good Mamma  Lydia  And your affection begins to cool  Lucy  UmII can't say thatHeighoHe has his faults  Lydia  Ardently  I hope he has his virtues too  Lucy  So do IBut how to cure those faults  Lydia  If incurable 'twould break my heart  Lucy  Your ardor surprises meBut hush  Enter  COUNT  Count  Bowing  I was afraid Madam love  would not have found so much as a moment to speak its anxietiesNay even now  Looking haughtily toward Lydia  Lydia  Pointedly and almost in tears  Sir II am sensible of my own unworthiness  Exit  Lucy  That lady Sir is my friend  Count  Madam  Lucy  Why are you surprised  Count  MadamNono not surprisedThere is a maxim indeed which saysFriendship can only subsist between equals  Lucy  But where is the inferiority  Count  Madam  Lucy  You are above the poor the pitiful idea that wealth confers any claims  Count  Perhaps it does not Madam But beauty understanding wit in short mind confers ten thousand And in these I never beheld your peer  Lucy  Very prettily spoken indeed And I am almost persuaded that you love me very dearly  Count  Madam I adore you  Lucy  Yes you are continually thinking of my good qualities  Count  Eternally Madam I think of nothing else  Lucy  TrueYou never remember your own  Count  Were I totally insensible of my own Madam I should be unworthy of you  Lucy  You admire me even in my representatives my relations and friends Affable to all goodhumoured to all attentive to all your politeness ease and urbanity extend to every  person for whom you think my heart is any way interested Your passions are all subservient to love  Count  Yes Madam subservient is the very word They are all subservient to love  Lucy  You never recollect the dignity of your descent nor accuse mine of meanness You have too much understanding to plume your thoughts with turgid arrogance or to presume on the imaginary merit of an accident which none but ignorance prejudice and folly are so besotted as to attribute to themselves  Count  Mankind have agreed Madam to honour the descendants of the wise and the brave  Lucy  They have soBut you have too much native merit to arrogate to yourself the worth of others You are no jay decked in the peacock's feathers You are not idiot enough to imagine that a skin of parchment on which is emblazoned the arms and acts of one wise man with a long list of succeeding fools is any honour to you Responsible to mankind for the use or the abuse of such talents as you feel yourself endowed with you think only of how you may deserve greatly and disdain to be that secondary thing that insignificant cypher which is worthless except from situation  Count  The feelings of injured honour Madam perhaps may be too irritable They shrink from insult and spurn at contamination Yet honour is the source of a thousand virtues The parent of ten thousand glorious deeds Honour is generous sincere and magnanimous The protector of innocence the assertor of right the  avenger of wrong Yes Honour is the patron of arts the promoter of science the bulwark of government the defender of kings and the saviour of nationsIndulge me then in cherishing a sentiment so noble  Lucy  IndulgeApplaud you mean Honour with you never degenerates into ostentation Is never presumptuous Is no boaster Is eager to earn but scorns to extort preeminence Your honour is not that abject inflated phantom which usurps contested claims exacts submission which it does not merit offends irritates and incites disgust nay tarnishes even virtue itself You do not under the word Honour seek a miserable cobweb covering for exorbitant pride  Count  Madam accusation so pointed so  Lucy  Nay now Have not I been reading your panegyric  Enter a  FOOTMAN  Foot  My lady desires you will come to her immediately Madam  Lucy  Very well  Exit Footman  I am a thoughtless slighty girl What I say can have but little meaningElse indeed I would have ventured to have given you a word of adviceBut'Tis no matter  Count  Madam you have stung me to the soul If I am indeed what you describe 'twere time I should reform  Lucy  I must be goneI have I own been wildly picturing something to myself which I greatly fear I could not love  Exit  Count  And is it my likenessSurely it  cannot beCould not loveExcruciating thought  Exit after Lucy  Enter  EDMUND  in haste and  LYDIA  from an inner chamber meeting  Edm  Where is the Count  Lydia  This moment gone  Edm  Eagerly  Which way  Lydia  Through that door  Edm  Running stops at the door  Ah 'Tis too late The footman is telling him  Lydia  Why are you so much alarmed  Edm  The clouds are collected and the storm is coming  Lydia  What do you mean  Edm  Lady Peckham has watched her opportunity Sir Paul has dropt asleep in his armchair she has ordered your sister to her apartment and has sent to the Count to come and speak with her that is to come and be insulted here in the drawingroom  Lydia  What can be done  Edm  I know notI dread her intolerable tongue  Lydia  Perhaps were you to retire and when they grow warm▪ to interrupt them at the proper moment the presence of a third person might be some restraint on the workings of pride of the violent ebullitions of which I am in great apprehension  Edm  Had I but met the Count before he had received the message  Lydia  Here comes Lady Peckham Begone  Exit Edmund  Enter Lady  PECKHAM  followed by a Footman▪  Foot  I have delivered your ladyship's message and the

would not have her too old and disagreeable  Sir  Sam  Hem I can assure you MadamSheHemShe is a very beautiful young lady  Lucy  You surprise meOh Then perhaps she is some lowborn girl who has more pride than understanding and is willing to sacrifice her youth and beauty to the silly vanity of riding in a coach  Sir  Sam  QuiteHemQuite the contrary Madam  Lucy  Then she must be poor and must think  of marrying you for the sake of your riches hoping you will die soon  Sir  Sam  MadamHem She is very rich  Lucy  Is it possible  Sir  Sam  And I should flatter myself would not expect me to die too soon  Lucy  Oh But she will Young women never marry old men but with a wish to dance over their graves  Sir  Sam  Hem  Lucy  Perhaps the poor girl maymay have made a  faux pas  Sir  Sam  Hem Her virtue is unspotted Madam  Lucy  You amaze me Young rich beautiful and virtuous What can her reason be for making choice of you Why does not she rather marry some youth whose rare qualities resemble

young lady's consent has never been askedAnd would you be so selfish as to seek your own single gratification and be contented to see her condemned to misery pining to death for the youth she loves and justly detesting the  sight of you as the wicked unfeeling author of her wretchedness  Sir  Sam  Hem  Looking toward the door  Madam IHemI wish you a good evening  Lucy  Preventing his going

project you never had the courage to insult the lady by an avowal of your guilt  Sir  Sam  Hem Guilt Madam  Lucy  Yes Sir guiltHowever Sir she has perfectly understood your insinuations  Sir  Sam  Madam  Lucy  She has infinite respect for filial duties But though she would beware of offending her parents I know her to be equally determined never to entail misery on herself nor to accept a husband whom she could neither esteem admire nor love  Sir  Sam  MadamIHemYour servant Madam  Lucy  Between him and the door  Not till you first promise  Sir  Sam  Forgetting his fear  I'll promise any thing Madam  Lucy  That you will not render yourself more ridiculous by persevering in so absurd so unjust a pursuit  Sir  Sam  No Madam I'm quite ridiculous enough already  Lucy  Nay more that you will not seek some less friended more enslaved or more timid young creature whom your misapplied wealth might command  Sir  Sam  Whatever you please Madam  Lucy  But that you will rather apply your superfluous hoards to the protection of youthful innocence  Sir  Sam  Suffer me but to depart Madam and I will bequeath my estates in perpetuity as you shall direct I'll entail them on the

effectually made your peace with my mamma  Count  I have done my endeavour MadamWould I were at peace with myself  Lucy  And are you still Sir under the dominion of prejudice so weak Do you still repent  of what you so long have deemed your condescension  Count  Far otherwise Madam There are beings so peculiarly favoured of heaven and endowed with such high perfections both of body and of mind that they are superior to all the distinctions of men among whom they walk angels upon earth You are one of these And my misery is I never can deserve you  Lucy  You may have stumbled but this selfcondemnation shews it was but to rise with tenfold strength Persevere and we will be severed only by death  Enter  EDMUND  Edm  At length my dear Count Lady Peckham is pacified To stoop to her illplaced pride to overlook her prejudice and to petition as you did was noble in you I have seconded your efforts have pledged myself for your honour and guaranteed your veracity  Count  Then Sir you have struck a dagger to my heart I have been guilty of falsehood That very pride and that exalted or I fear extravagant sense of honour which should have preserved me from a stain so hateful have dashed me down the precipice  Edm  You amaze me  Count  'Tis true 'twas inadvertent but rankling vanity strengthened by a purer motive the trembling alarms of love induced me to persist nay a second time to aid deception  Lucy  You did wrongBut which of us can say they never erred  Edm  Ay Who will stand forth and affirm  that amid the rude whirl the confused doubts or the terrors of passion they never once have been betrayed into your crime For a crime I own it is and with consequences so wide so pernicious and so fatal that when it shall be extirpated from the earth that moment man will be perfect But in this poor world's present state it is so far venial that painful humiliating thought nothe noblest the purest of us all cannot strike his heart and sayI never was a liar  Lucy  Frail as we are and hourly as the arts of falsehood are practised upon us to our detriment and often to our ruin those only are most free from guilt who shake contagion soonest from them and by the next sublime effort of truth scorning to shrink from shame which is their due in some sort turn the vice itself to virtue  Edm  But what have you said that  Enter  SIR PAUL  Sir  Paul  Come come We must

turpitude Deep is my offence against you and nature But let nature plead in my behalf Here at your feet repentant for my faults I claim that pity which a father so good and so affectionate will not

Chequered are the scenes of life Pleasure and pain joy and grief austerity and laughter intermingling weave a motley web Our prejudices are our punishments they cling about us warp our actions distort

MATTOCKS  THE curtain dropt of course the author sends  Me to salute our gen'rous noble friends  To me you listen he politely says  Whene'er I prattle with a wish to praise  For kindness so unceasing may you be  As happy ev'ry soul as your applause makes me  But to my textThe theme tonight is Pride  Much have we saidand much more have implied  Our boldest strokes are feeble nor can shew  The child of Pride with half his genuine glow  Of Pride which can such various forms assume  Now rise an emperor now sink a groom  Mounted aloft the wonder of his age  With hackney coachmen furious war to wage  Six swandown waistcoats swathe him into shape  His legs all buckskin and his coat all cape  With manners looks and language such you'd swear  His tutor had been Piccadilly's Bear  When most contemptible most hoping praise  And only envious of the groom he pays  Four dappled greys in front behind three men  Down PallMall dashing to da  up again  Then only in his height and pomp of pride  When Girl or Gambler's seated by his side  Driving by day dicing by night his passion  Such is the modern man of highflown fashion  Such are the scions sprung from RunnyMead  The richest soil that bears the rankest weed  Potatoe like the sprouts are worthless found  And all that's good of them is under ground  Of Pride one single sketch in crayons more  Behold her torch Hark Thunder shakes the door  The carriage stops the footmen make a lane  The feathers stoop and enter Lady Jane  Perfect in how d'ye do drop bob and bow  Curtseys my friends are out of fashion now  To the Galleries  First to his Grace next to the next of birth  She none forgetssave genius wit and worth  Whom if she mark 'tis with a modish stare  To ask who knows them or How came they there  Now at the bank in antichamber kept  Where Pharaoh's host twelve tedious hours had slept  She seats herself like palpitating lover  Eager the last night's losses to recover  No sense of virtue dignity or shame  Her greatest pride her knowledge of the game  That pride most piqued most mortified to see  A Nabob's wife stake larger sums than she  And now three anxious hours have slipt away  Three hundreds have been lost in piddling play  No luck for her Aloud fresh cards she calls  Her passions rising as her pocket falls  She punts again she loses and again  Oaths quiver on her lip She names the ten  Stung to the soul a desp'rate sett she makes  Till even the winning banker deals and quakes  Ghastly she pants with horror in her eye  To be the first the fatal card to spy  The fatal card is turn'd and ends the reign  Of Fashion Folly Pride and Lady Jane  Here too we end oblig'd ourselves to own  Our pride is greatwhen we can please the town
