 THE DoubleDealer COMEDY As it is Acted at the  THEATRE ROYAL  By Their MAJESTIES Servants  Written by Mr  CONGREVE  Interdum tamen vocem Comedia tollit  Ar Po  Huic equidem Consilio palmam do hic me magnifice effero qui vim tantam in me potestatem habeam tantae astutiae vera dicendo ut eos ambos fallam  Syr in Terent  The SECOND EDITION  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  GraysInn  Lane  To the Right Honourable  CHARLES MONTAGÆ²E  One of the Lords of the  TREASURY  SIR  I Heartily wish this Play  as perfect as I intended it that it might be more worthy your Acceptance and that my Dedication of it to you might be more becoming that Honour and Esteem which I with every Body who are so fortunate as to know you have for you It had your Countenance when yet unknown and now it is made publick it wants your Protection  I would not have any Body imagine that I think  without  Faults for I am Conscious of several I confess I design'd whatever Vanity or Ambition occasion'd that Design to have written a true and regular Comedy but I found it an Undertaking which put me in mind of  Sudet multum frustraque laboret ausus idem  And now to make Amends for the Vanity of such a Design I do confess both the Attempt and the imperfect Performance Yet I must take the Boldness to say I have not miscarried in the whole for the Mechanical part of it is perfect That I may say with as little Vanity as a Builder may say he has built a House according to the Model laid down before him or a Gardiner that he has set his Flowers in a Knot of such or such a Figure I design'd the Moral first and to that Moral I invented the Fable and do not know that I have borrow'd one Hint of it any where I made the Plot as strong as I could because it was single and I made it single because I would avoid Confusion and was resolved to preserve the three Unities of the Drama which I have visibly done to the utmost Severity This is what I ought not to observe upon my self but the Ignorance and Malice of the greater Part of the Audience is such that they would make a Man turn Herald to his own Play and Blazon every Character However Sir this Discourse is very impertinent to you whose  Judgement much better can discern the Faults than I can excuse them and whose good Nature like that of a Lover will find out those hidden Beauties if there are any such which it wou'd be great Immodesty for me to discover I think I don't speak improperly when I call you a  Lover  of Poetry for it is very well known she has been a very kind Mistress to you she has not deny'd you the last Favour you have enjoy'd her and she has been fruitful in a most Beautiful IssueIf I break off abruptly here I hope every Body will understand that it is to avoid a Commendation which as it is your Due would be most easie for me to pay and too troublesome for you to receive  I have since the Acting of this Play harken'd after the Objections which have been made to it for I was Conscious where a true Critick might have put me upon my Defence I was prepared for their Attack and am pretty confident I could have vindicated some Parts and excused others and where there were any plain Miscarriages I would most ingenuously have confess'd 'em But I have not heard any thing said sufficient to provoke an Answer That which looks most like an Objection does not relate in particular to this Play but to all or most that ever have been written and that is Soliloquy Therefore I will answer it not only for my own sake but to save others the Trouble to whom it may hereafter be Objected  I grant that for a Man to Talk to himself appears absurd and unnatural and indeed it is so in most Cases but the Circumstances which may attend the Occasion make great Alteration It oftentimes happens to a Man to have Designs which require him to himself and in their Nature cannot admit of a Confident Such for certain is all Villany and other less mischievous Intentions may be very improper to be Communicated to a second Person In such a Case therefore the Audience must observe whether the Person upon the Stage takes any notice of them at all or no For if he supposes any one to be by when he talks to himself it is monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree Nay not only in this case but in any Part of a Play if there is expressed any knowledge of an Audience it is insufferable But otherwise when a Man in Soliloquy reasons with himself and  Pro  's and  Con  's and weighs all his Designs We ought not to imagine that this Man either talks to us or to himself he is only thinking and thinking such Matter as were inexcusable Folly in him to speak But because we are conceal'd Spectators of the Plot in agitation and the Poet finds it necessary to let us know the whole Mystery of his  Contrivance he is willing to inform us of this Person's Thoughts and to that end is forc'd to make use of the expedient of Speech no other better way being yet invented for the Communication of Thought  Another very wrong Objection has been made by some who have not taken Leisure to distinguish the Characters The Hero of the Play as they are pleas'd to call him meaning  Mellefont  is a Gull and made a Fool and cheated Is every Man a Gull and a Fool that is deceiv'd At that rate I'm afraid the two Classes of Men will be reduc'd to one and the Knaves themselves be at a loss to justifie their Title But if an Openhearted honest Man who has an entire Confidence in one whom he takes to be his Friend and whom he has oblig'd to be so and who to confirm him in his Opinion in all Appearance and upon several Trials has been so If this Man be deceiv'd by the Treachery of the other must he of necessity commence Fool immediately only because the other has prov'd a Villam Ay but there was Caution given to  Mellefont  in the First Act by his Friend  Careless  Of what Nature was that Caution Only to give the Audience some Light into the Character of  Maskwell  before his Appearance and not to convince  Mellefont  of his Treachery for that was more than  Careless  was then able to do He never knew  Maskwell  guilty of any Villany he was only a sort of Man which he did not like As for his suspecting his Familiarity with my Lady  Touchwood  Let 'em examine the Answer that  Mellefont  makes him and compare it with the Conduct of  Maskwell  's Character through the Play  I would beg'em again to look into the Character of  Maskwell  before they accuse  Mellefont  of Weakness for being deceiv'd by him For upon summing up the Enquiry into this Objection it may be found they have mistaken Cunning in one Character for Folly in another  But there is one thing at which I am more concerned than all the false Criticisms that are made upon me and that is some of the Ladies are offended I am heartily sorry for it for I declare I would rather disoblige all the Criticks in the World than one of the Fair Sex They are concerned that I have represented some Women Vicious and Affected How can I help it It is the Business of a Comick Poet to paint the Vices and Follies of Humankind and there are but two Sexes Male and Female  Men  and  Women  which have a Title to Humanity And if I leave one half of them out the Work will be imperfect I should be very glad of an opportunity to make my Compliment to those Ladies who are offended But they can no more expect it in a Comedy than to be  Tickled by a Surgeon when he's letting 'em Blood They who are Virtuous or Discreet can hardly be offended for such Characters as these distinguish  them  and make their Beauties more shining and observ'd And they who are of the other kind may nevertheless pass for such by seeming not to be displeas'd or touch'd with the Satire of this  Comedy  Thus have they also wrongfully accus'd me of doing them a Prejudice when I have in reality done them a Service  I have heard there are some who intend to accuse this Play of Smuttiness and Bawdy But I can hardly believe it because I took a particular Care to avoid it and if they find any in it it is of their own making for I did not design it to be so understood But to avoid my saying any Thing upon a Subject which has been so admirably handled before and for their better Instruction I earnestly recommend to their Perusal the Epistle Dedicatory before the  PlainDealer  You will pardon me Sir for the Freedom I take of making Answers to other People in an Epistle which ought wholly to be sacred to you But since I intend the Play to be so too I hope I may take the more Liberty of Justifying it where it is in the Right  I must now Sir declare to the World how kind you have been to my Endeavours for in regard of what was well meant you have excus'd what was ill perform'd I beg you would continue the same Method in your Acceptance of this Dedication I know no other way of making a Return to that Humanity you shew'd in protecting an Infant but by Enrolling it in your Service now that it is of Age and come into the World Therefore be pleas'd to accept of this as an Acknowledgement of the Favour you have shewn me and an Earnest of the real Service and Gratitude of  SIR  Your Most Obliged Humble Servant  William Congreve  To my Dear Friend Mr  CONGREVE  On His COMEDY call'd The DoubleDealer  WELL then the promis'd Hour is come at last  The present Age of Wit obscures the past  Strong were our Syres and as they Fought they Writ  Conqu'ring with Force of Arms and Dint of Wit  Theirs was the Giant Race before the Flood  And thus when  Charles  Return'd our Empire stood  Like  Janus  he the stubborn Soil manur'd  With Rules of Husbandry the Rankness cur'd  Tam'd us to Manners when the Stage was rude  And boistrous  English  Wit with Art indu'd  Our Age was cultivated thus at length  But what we gain'd in Skill we lost in Strength  Our Builders were with Want of Genius curst  The Second Temple was not like the First  'Till You the best  Vitruvius  come at length  Our Beauties equal but excel our Strength  Firm  Dorique  Pillars found Your solid Base  The fair  Corinthian  crowns the higher Space  Thus all below is Strength and all above is Grace  In easie Dialogue is  Fletcher  's Praise  He mov'd the Mind but had no Pow'r to raise  Great  Johnson  did by Strength of Judgment please  Yet doubling  Fletcher  's Force he wants his Ease  In diff'ring Tallents both adorn'd their Age  One for the Study t' other for the Stage  But both to  Congreve  justly shall submit  One match'd in Judgment both o'ermatch'd in Wit  In Him all Beauties of this Age we see  Etherege  his Courtship  Southern  's Purity  The Satire Wit and Strength of Manly  Witcherly  All this in blooming Youth you have Atchiev'd  Now are vour soil'd Contemporaries griev'd  So much the Sweetness of your Manners move  We cannot Envy you because we Love  Fabius  might ioy in  Scipio  when he saw  And join his Suffrage to the Votes of  Rome  Though he with  Hannibal  was overcome  Thus old  Romano  bow'd to  Raphael  's Fame  And Scholar to the Youth he taught became  Oh that your Brows my Lawrel had sustain'd  Well had I been Depos'd if You had Reign'd  The Father had descended for the Son  For only You are lineal to the Throne  Thus when the State one  Edward  did depose  A Greater  Edward  in his Room arose  But now not I but Poetry is curs'd  For  Tom  the Second reigns like  Tom  the First  But let'em not mistake my Patron's Part  Nor call his Charity their own Desert  Yet this I Prophesie Thou shalt be seen  Tho' with some short Parenthesis between  High on the Throne of Wit and seated there  Not mine that's little but thy Lawrel wear  Thy first Attempt an early Promise made  That early Promise this has more than paid  So bold yet so judiciously you dare  That your least Praise is to be Regular  Time Place and Action may with Pains be wrought  But Genius must be born and never can be taught  This is Your Portion this Your Native Store  Heav'n that but once was Prodigal before  To  Shakespeare  gave as much she cou'd not give him more  Maintain your Post That's all the Fame you need  For 'tis impossible you shou'd proceed  Already I am worn with Cares and Age  And just abandoning th' Ungrateful Stage  Unprofitably kept at Heav'ns Expence  I live a Rentcharge on his Providence  But You whom ev'ry Muse and Grace adorn  Whom I foresee to better Fortune born  Be kind to my Remains and oh defend  Against your Judgment your departed Friend  Let not th' insulting Foe my Fame pursue  But shade those Lawrels which descend to You  And take for Tribute what these Lines express  You merit more nor cou'd my Love do less  John Dryden  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mrs  Bracegirdle  MOors have this Way as Story tells to know  Whether their Brats are truly got or no  Into the Sea the Newborn Babe is thrown  There as Instinct directs to Swim or Drawn  A Barbarous Device to try if Spouse  Have kept Religiously her Nuptial Vows  Such are the Trials Poets make of Plays  Only they trust to more inconstant Seas  So does our Author this his Child commit  To the Tempestuous Mercy of the Pit  To know if it be truly born of Wit  Criticks avaunt for you are Fish of Prey  And feed like Sharks upon an Infant Play  Be ev'ry Monster of the Deep away  Let's have a fair Trial and a clear Sea  Let Nature work and do not Damn too soon  For Life will struggle long 'ere it sink down  Let it at least rise Thrice before it Drown  Let us consider had it been our Fate  Thus hardly to be prov'd Legitimate  I will not say we'd all in Danger been  Were each to suffer for his Mother's Sin  But by my Troth I cannot avoid thinking  How nearly some good Men might have 'scap'd Sinking  But Heav'n be prais'd this Custom is confin'd  Alone to th' Offspring of the Muses kind  Our Christian Cuckolds are more bent to Pity  I know not one  Moor  Husband in the City  I th' Good Man's Arms the Chopping Bastard thrives  For he thinks all his own that is his Wives  Whatever Fate is for this Play design'd  The Poet's

Laugh at I think there I was with you ha  Mellefont  Mel  O' my Word  Brisk  that was a home thrust you have silenc'd him  Brisk  Oh my Dear  Mellefont  let me perish if thou art not the Soul of Conversation the very Essence of Wit and Spirit of WineThe Deuce take me if there were three good Things said or one understood since thy Amputation from the body of our SocietyHe I think that's pretty and Metaphorical enough I'Gad I could not have said it out of thy Company  Careless  ha  Care  Hum ay what is't  Brisk  O  Mon Coeur  What is't Nay gad I'll punish you for want of Apprehension The Duce take me if I tell you  Mel  No no hang him he has no TasteBut dear  Brisk  excuse me I have a little Business  Care  Prithee get thee gone thou see'st we are serious  Mel  We'll come

Zenith  to the  Nadir  But the Duce take me if I say a good Thing till you comeBut prithee dear Rogue make haste prithee make haste I shall burst elseAnd yonder your Uncle my Lord  Touchwood  swears he'll Disinherit you and Sir  Paul Plyant  threatens to disclaim you for a SoninLaw and my Lord  Froth  won't Dance at your Wedding to Morrow nor the Duce take me I won't Write your Epithalamiumand see what a Condition you're like to be brought to  Mel  Well I'll speak but three Words and follow you  Brisk  Enough enough  Careless  bring your Apprehension along with you  Exit  Care  Pert Coxcomb  Mel  Faith 'tis a good natur'd Coxcomb and has very Entertaining FolliesYou must be more humane to him at this Juncture it will do me ServiceI'll tell you I would have Mirth continued this Day at any Rate tho' Patience purchase Folly and Attention be paid with Noise There are Times when Sense may be  unseasonable as well as Truth Prithee  Day but allow  Brisk  to have Wit that thou may'st seem a Fool  Care  Why how now why this extravagant    Mel  O I would have no room for  Jealous of a Plot I would have Noise and  my Lady  Touchwood  's Head from working For Hell  busie than her Brain nor  nations  Care  I thought your Fear of her had been over  to Morrow appointed for your Marriage with  Cynthia  Father Sir  Paul Plyant  come to settle the Writings  purpose  Mel  True but you shall judge whether I have not Reason to be allarm'd None besides you and  Maskwell  are acquainted with the Secret of my Aunt  Touchwood's  violent Passion for me Since my first Refusal of her Addresses she has endeavour'd to do me all ill Offices with my Uncle yet has manag'd 'em with that Subtilty that to him they have born the face of Kindness while her Malice like a Dark Lanthorn only shone upon me where it was directed Still it gave me less Perplexity to prevent the Success of her Displeasure than to avoid the Importunities of her Love and of two Evils I thought my self favour'd in her Aversion But whether urg'd by her Despair and the short Prospect of Time she saw to accomplish her Designs whether the Hopes of Revenge or of her Love terminated in the View of this my Marriage with  Cynthia  I know not but this Morning she surpriz'd me in my Bed  Care  Was there ever such a Fury 'tis well Nature has not put it into her Sexes power to RavishWell bless us  What follow'd  Mel  What at first amaz'd me for I look'd to have seen her in all the Transports of a slighted and revengeful Woman But when I expected Thunder from her Voice and Lightning in her Eyes I saw her melted into Tears and hush'd into a Sigh It was long before either of us spoke Passion had ty'd her Tongue and Amazement mineIn short the Consequence was thus she omitted nothing that the most violent Love could urge or tender Words express which when she saw had  but still I pleaded Honour and Nearness of Blood  the Storm I fear'd at first For  a Fury she flew to my Sword and  her doing  her self a Mischief Having  her in a  Gust of Passion she left me and in a Resolution confirm'd by a Thousand Curses not to close her Eyes 'till she had seen my Ruin  Care  Exquisite Woman But what the Devil does she think thou hast no more Sense than to get an Heir upon her Body to disinherit thy self for as I take it this Settlement upon you is with a Proviso that your Uncle have no Children  Mel  It is so Well the Service you are to do me will be a Pleasure to your self I must get you to engage my Lady  Plyant  all this Evening that my Pious Aunt may not work her to her Interest And if you chance to secure her to your self you may incline her to mine She's handsome and knows it is very silly and thinks she has Sense and has an old fond Husband  Care  I confess a very fair Foundation for a Lover to build upon  Mel  For my Lord  Froth  he and his Wife will be sufficiently taken up with admiring one another and  Brisk  's Gallantry as they call it I'll observe my Uncle my self and  Jack Maskwell  has promised me to watch my Aunt narrowly and give me notice upon a Suspicion As for Sir  Paul  my wise FatherinLaw that is to be my Dear  Cynthia  has such a share in his Fatherly Fondness he would scarce make her a Moment uneasie to have her happy hereafter  Care  So you have mann'd your Works but I wish you may not have the weakest Guard where the Enemy is strongest  Mel  Maskwell  you mean prithee why should you suspect him  Care  Faith I cannot help it you know I never lik'd him I am a little Superstitious in Physiognomy  Mel  He has Obligations of Gratitude to bind him to me his Dependance upon my Uncle is though my Means  Care  Upon your Aunt you mean  Mel  My Aunt  Care  I'm mistaken if there be not a Familiarity between them you do not suspect For all her Passion for you  Mel  Pooh pooh nothing in the World but his Design to do me Service and he endeavours to be well in her Esteem that he may be able to effect it  Care  Well I shall be glad to be mistaken but your Aunt's Aversion in her Revenge cannot be any way so effectually shown as in bringing forth a Child to disinherit you She is Handsome and Cunning and naturally wanton  Maskwell  is Flesh and Blood at best and Opportunities between them are frequent His Affection to you you have confessed is grounded upon his Interest that you have transplanted and should it take Root in my Lady I don't see what you can  Mel  I confess the Consequence is visible were your Suspicions justBut see the Company is broke up let's meet 'em  Enter Lord  Touchwood  Lord  Froth  Sir  Paul Plyant  and  Brisk  Ld Touch

Now when I Laugh I always Laugh alone  Brisk  I suppose that's because you Laugh at your own Jests I'gad ha ha ha  Ld Froth  He he I swear tho' your Raillery provokes me to a Smile  Brisk  Ay my Lord

 of their Wits render themselves as ridiculous as Fools 'Tis an odd Game we're going to Play at What think you of drawing Stakes and giving over in time  Mel  No hang't that's not endeavouring to win because it's possible we may loose since we have Shuffled and Cutt let's e'en turn up Trump now  Cynt  Then I find it's like Cards if either of us have a good Hand it is an Accident of Fortune  Mel  No Marriage is rather like a Game at Bowls Fortune indeed makes the Match and the Two nearest and sometimes the Two farthest are together but the Game depends intirely upon Judgement  Cynt  Still it is a Game and consequently one of us must be a Loser  Mel  Not at all only a Friendly Trial of Skill and the Winnings to be Shared between usWhat's here the Musick  Oh my Lord has promised the Company

don't care for her  Care  'Pox I can't get an Answer from her that does not begin with her Honour or her Virtue her Religion or some such Cant Then she has told me the whole History of Sir  Paul  's Nine Years Courtship how he has lain for whole Nights together upon the Stairs before her ChamberDoor and that the first Favour he receiv'd from her was a Piece of an old Scarlet Petticoat for a Stomacher which since the Day of his Marriage he has out of a piece of Gallantry converted into a NightCap and wears it still with much Solemnity on his Anniversary WeddingNight  Mel  That I have seen with the Ceremony thereunto belongingFor on that Night he creeps in at the Bed's Feet like a gull'd Bassa that has marry'd a Relation of the  Grand Signior  's and that Night he  his Arms at Liberty Did not she tell you  at what Distance she keeps  He  at some certain times that is I suppose when she apprehends being with Child he never has the Privilege of using the Familiarity of a Husband with his Wife He was once given to scrambling with his Hands and sprawling in his Sleep and ever since she has him swaddled up in Blankets and his Hands and Feet swath'd down and so put to Bed and there he lies with a great Beard like a  Russian  Bear upon a drift of Snow You are very great with him I wonder he never told you his Grievances he will I warrant you  Care  Excessively foolishBut that which gives me most Hopes of her is her telling me of the many Temptations she has resisted  Mel  Nay then you have her for a Woman's bragging to a Man that she has overcome Temptations is an Argument that they were weakly offer'd and a Challenge to him to engage her more irresistably 'Tis only an inhancing the Price of the Commodity by telling you how many Customers have underbid her  Care  Nay I don't despairBut still she has a grudging to youI talk'd to her t'other Night at my Lord  Froth  's Masquerade when I'm satisfied she knew me and I had no reason to complain of my Reception but I find Women are not the same barefaced and in Masksand a Vizor disguises their Inclinations as much as their Faces  Mel  'Tis a Mistake for Women may most properly be said to be unmask'd when they wear Vizors for that secures them from Blushing and being out of Countenance and next to being in the Dark or alone they are most truly themselves in a Vizor Mask Here they come I'll leave you Ply her close and by and by clap a  Billet doux  into her Hand For a Woman never thinks a Man truly in Love with her 'till he has been Fool enough to think of her out of her Sight and to lose so much time as to write to

never do's well when the Parties are so agreedFor when People walk Hand in Hand there's neither overtaking nor meeting We Hunt in Couples where we both pursue the same Game but forget one another and 'tis because we are so near that we don't think of coming together  Mel  Hum 'gad I believe there's something in'tMarriage is the Game that we Hunt and while we think that we only have it in View I

our Fears  Mel  I don't know why we should not steal out of the House this Moment and Marry one another without Consideration or the Fear of Repentance Pox o'Fortune Portion Settlements and Jointures  Cynt  Ay ay what have we to do with 'em you know we Marry for Love  Mel  Love Love downright very Villainous Love  Cynt  And he that can't live upon Love deserves to die in a DitchHere then I give you

HoldNever to Marry any Body else  Mel  That's but a kind of Negative ConsentWhy you won't baulk the Frolick  Cynt  If you had not been so assured of your own Conduct I would notBut 'tis but reasonable that since I consent to like a Man without the vile Consideration of Mony he should give me a very evident Demonstration of his Wit Therefore let me see you undermine my Lady  Touchwood  as you boasted and force her to give her Consent and then  Mel  I'll do't  Cynt  And I'll do't  Mel  This very next ensuing Hour of Eight a Clock is the last Minute of her Reign unless the Devil assist her in  propria persona  Cynt  Well if the Devil should assist her and your Plot miscarry  Mel  Ay what am I to trust to then  Cynt  Why if you give me very clear demonstration that it was the Devil I'll allow for irresistable odds But if I find it to be only Chance or Destiny or unlucky Stars or any thing but the very Devil I'm inexorable Only still I'll keep my Word and live a Maid for your sake

with you on purpose to betray you and that which put me upon it was the finding it impossible to gain the Lady any other way but in the Hopes of her Marrying you  Mel  So  Mask  So why so while you're busied in making your self ready I'll wheedle her into the Coach and instead of you borrow my Lord's Chaplain and so run away with her my self  Mel  O I conceive you you'll tell him so  Mask  Tell him so Ay why you don't think I mean to do so  Mel  No no ha ha I dare swear thou wilt not  Mask  Aside  You may be deceiv'dTherefore for our farther Security I would have you disguis'd like a Parson that if my Lord should have Curiosity to peep he may not discover you in the Coach but think the Cheat is carried on as he would have it  Mel  Excellent  Maskwell  thou wert certainly meant for a Statesman

 Mask  Stay I have a doubtUpon second Thoughts we had better meet in the Chaplain's Chamber here the corner Chamber at this end of the Gallery there is a back Way into it so that you need not come through this Doorand a Pair of private Stairs leads down to the StablesIt will be more convenient  Cynt  I am guided by youbut  Mellefont  will mistake  Mask  No no I'll after him immediately and tell him  Cynt  I will not fail  Exit  Mask  Why  qui vult decipi decipiatur  'Tis no Fault of mine I have told 'em in plain Terms how easie 'tis for me to cheat 'em and if they will not hear the Serpent's

Ld T  Have you seen my Wife lately or disoblig'd her  Mask  No my Lord What can this mean  Aside  Ld T  Then  Mellefont  has urg'd some body to incense herSomething she has heard of you which carries her beyond the Bounds of Patience  Mel  This I fear'd  Aside  Did not your Lordship tell her of the Honours you design'd me  Ld T  Yes  Mel  'Tis that you know my Lady has a high Spirit she thinks I am unworthy  Ld T  Unworthy 'Tis an ignorant Pride in her to think soHonesty to me is true Nobility However 'tis my Will it should be so and that shou'd be convincing to her as much as ReasonBy Heav'n I'll not be Wiferidden were it possible it should be done this Night  Mask  By Heav'n he meets my Wishes  Aside  Few Things are impossible to willing Minds  Ld T  Instruct me how this may be done you

Here's CompanyCome this way and tell me  Exeunt  Enter  Careless  and  Cynthia  Care  Is not that he now gone out with my Lord  Cynt  Yes  Care  By Heav'n there's TreacheryThe Confusion that I saw

tell you any thing of the Chaplain's Chamber  Mel  No my Dear will you get readythe Things are all in my Chamber I want nothing but the Habit  Care  You are betray'd and  Maskwell  is the Villain I always thought him  Cynt  When you were gone he said his Mind was chang'd and bid me meet him in the Chaplain's Room pretending immediately to follow you and give you notice  Mel  How  Care  There's  Saygrace  tripping by with a Bundle under his ArmHe cannot be ignorant that  Maskwell  means to use his Chamber let's follow and examine him  Mel  'Tis loss of timeI cannot think him false  Exeunt  Mel  and  Care  Cynt  My Lord musing  Enter Ld  Touchwood  Ld T  He has a quick Invention if this were suddenly design'dYet he says he had prepar'd my Chaplain already  Cynt  How's this Now I fear

hear you  Mask  Aside  Thanks my Invention and now I have it for youFirst tell me what urg'd you to this Violence For your Passion broke in such imperfect Terms that yet I am to learn the Cause  L T  My Lord himself surpriz'd me with the News you were to marry  Cynthia  That you had own'd your Love to him and his Indulgence would assist you to attain your Ends  Cynt  How my Lord  Ld T  Pray forbear all Resentments for a while and let us hear the rest  Mask  I grant you in Appearance all is true I seem'd consenting to my Lord nay transported with the BlessingBut could you think that I who

all the rest though I would give a Limb for every Look you cheaply throw away on any other Object of your Love yet so far I prize your Pleasures o'er own that all this seeming Plot that I have laid has been to gratifie your Taste and cheat the World to prove a faithful Rogue to you  L T  If this were trueBut how can it be  Mask  I have so contriv'd that  Mellefont  will presently in the Chaplain's Habit wait for  Cynthia  in your DressingRoom But I have put the Change upon her that she may be otherwhere employ'dDo you procure her NightGown and with your Hoods tyed over your Face meet him in her stead you may go privately by the back Stairs and unperceiv'd there you may propose to reinstate him in his Uncle's Favour if he'll comply with your Desires his Case is desperate and I believe he'll yield to any ConditionsIf not here take this you may employ it better than in the Death of one who is nothing when not yours  Gives the Dagger  L T  Thou can'st deceive every BodyNay
