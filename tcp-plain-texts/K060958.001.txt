robb'd my dear Mother of Life and I came into the World an innocent Murderer the last of five Sons  Tho' my Father had a considerable Estate yet as I was the youngest of all there was  but little to expect for me and ere I arriv'd to my fourth Year a Motherinlaw was brought into the Family that had one Son and two Daughters but she secur'd to my Father a considerable Estate while she liv'd tho' after her Death it was to devolve on her own Children and I am pretty well inform'd that was the chief Motive of my Father's wishing her a long Life  Sure Marriage must be an unfortunate State on such Conditions especially on one Side for every body agreed my Motherinlaw from her outward Behaviour was very fond of my Father but she laid out her whole Portion of GoodNature upon him she having not one Grain left for any of his Children and between 'em both good Housekeeping was banish'd that liv'd with us in my Mother's Days  My Father give him his Due was raking enough to provide for  his  Children and his Wife was not an Ace behind him in taking Care for  hers    My Motherinlaw's Son was much of my own Age so to School we were sent together which was the happiest Time of my Life for my good Motherinlaw being overfond of her only Son allow'd him handsomly of  every thing and my Father that there should be no Difference between us did the like by me so we both far'd the better by their Emulation and whatever Brother  Jack  had one Day to be sure  Billy  meaning myself had the next But tho' it favours of Vanity to praise myself yet I will declare I was a better Proficient in Learning than my Schoolfellow for I took a great Pleasure in my Studying but on the contrary my Brother was very idle and I often receiv'd good part of his Money for the Week to make his Exercise for him so by this Method our Parents imagin'd him a better Scholar than he was  Our Master tho' a rigid one was something deceiv'd in him for I was very cautious of letting any one understand the Helps I gave him well knowing if it was once discover'd I shou'd lose my Perquisites as I call'd 'em But one  Christmas  it all came out  The Parson of the Parish being at Dinner and as it prov'd which does not always happen a good Scholar was desir'd to examine the Yonkers as they call'd us my Mother being gone out of the Room just before  Domine  set upon me first paying as  he thought a Compliment to my Father and I went thro' my Examination so readily that my Father gave me a Crownpiece to encourage me but at the same time whisper'd me to put it up before the good Woman my Motherinlaw came back again  When the Parson had finish'd several elaborate Speeches on the Ripeness of my Genius and what not adding among the rest He did not fear in time but he shou'd see me a great Statesman he took my Schoolfellow  John  to Task who came to Examination like a Thief to his Trial I stood just behind him and prompted him unheard by the rest of the Company yet he made so many Blunders that like Sir  Martin  and his Man  Warner  we were both discover'd at which I was very much griev'd for I soon apprehended such Care wou'd be taken of Mr  Dunce  that I shou'd finger no more of his Money and all the Praises I receiv'd from the Company for the Aptness of my Parts  c  cou'd not extinguish the Thoughts on't But to mend the matter my Motherinlaw who happen'd to come in just as he was beginning his Firy Trial big with Expectation of her Son  Johnny  proving a  Prodigy of Learning and finding herself so much disappointed cou'd not contain her Temper but flew out in a manner little pleasing to the Company She did not doubt she said but there had been much Pains taken with that Jackanapes meaning my Worship but she wou'd take care for the future to choose a Master that was in her Interest to instruct her Child that it was much against her Inclination at first to let him go where all my Brothers had gone before being the Teacher was in my Father's Interest and a thousand such Speeches which struck my Father into Amazement and tho' the Parson with a great deal of Reason that perhaps you'll say is a Wonder us'd many fine Speeches to qualify this Matter yet they all prov'd like Words utter'd in a Desart but when Brother  Jack  in Tears told her my Father had given me a Crown she grew outragious and with a great deal of Dexterity gave me a handsome Box on the Ear less gentle I believe than the Boor gives the Duke of  Carinthia  is a Province of  Germany  upon the Borders of  Italy  Whenever the Ducal Coronet is vacant the Person who is to be install'd is seated in a Chair of great Antiquity made like two great Chairs put Back to Back with two Seats in one the intended Duke sits in the other a Boor of the Country who is to offer two Oxen to the Duke one the leanest the other the fattest that can be got but the Duke is to return the fat one to the Boor which is to intimate he is to improve his Country or Dukedom for sometimes it is the Emperor of  Germany  who is chose Duke of  Carinthia  from the Poverty of the lean Ox to that of the fat One When that Part of the Ceremony is over the Boor or Countryman rises up comes to the Duke who is fitting with his Face to the East and gives him a gentle Box on the Ear after that he puts on his Feet a Pair of Shoes fill'd with the Earth of the Country and that concludes the Installment tho' the last Part of the Ceremony they omit when a Proxy is install'd which often happens when the Title is conferr'd on the Emperor or some other Potentate  Carinthia  at his Installation  My Father to be even with her return'd my Brother  John  one as like it as a couple of BilliardBalls My good Motherinlaw perceiving it was resolv'd to be even with him and gave it me handsomly on both sides my Ears which was return'd smartly back upon the Chops of my Schoolfellow by my Father till we got handsomly cuff'd between 'em  My Father seeing his Wife's Rage rather increas'd than diminish'd laid hold of both her Hands she struggling to get loose and  finding it impossible spit in my Father's Face who was so much confounded that he let her go and she waddled out of the Room like a Goose upon a Common  When she was gone my Father sat him down in his Chair without speaking for some time but at last broke out with an exalted Voice This is the first time I ever wish'd myself unmarry'd and I am very much in fear it will not be the last for when once Man and Wife have broke thro' the Respect they owe each other continual Jarrs will succeed and the first Quarrel will soon be follow'd by many others I have no Notion continu'd he after this Breach we can ever be properly reconcil'd  The good Parson said many things in order to excuse both Parties but my Father gave him no manner of Answer He seeing things in so much Confusion took his Leave  When he was gone my Father began to examine me about my Brother  Jack  and the Reason why my Master did not acquaint him with his Indocibility I well knowing he abhorr'd a Lye declar'd to him the whole Truth but begg'd his Pardon telling him my young Apprehension cou'd not conceive such Confusion wou'd follow  Well return'd my Father I have Reason to believe you will never be guilty of such Inadvertencies again therefore I freely pardon you but for the future you must go to School by yourself at least 'till this Matter is blown over and my Wife and I are thoroughly reconcil'd if there is a Possibility of it Upon saying this he wav'd his Hand that I might leave him to himself  As soon as I got into the Courtyard before the House my Brother  Jack  met me Ah said he my Mother has given me a Crown as well as my Father did you I am glad on't return'd I I believe that's a Lye said my Mother who was coming out of the Garden and had staid to listen as I suppose Madam I have learnt said I to speak Truth whatever may be the Consequence and in most of the Books we are to learn we are inform'd our Tongue and Heart shou'd always go together Ha said she What I suppose you are setting up for a young Philosopher But I believe you have got a few Sentences by rote as Parrots have that you sputter out unseasonably I told her whatever I had learnt I wou'd take care never to say any thing to offend her No said she you will always be an Offence to  me silent or speaking I told her I was very sorry for't and went back again with the Tears running down my Cheeks intending to go up into the Room where I lay but was met by my Father who seeing the Tears trickling down my Face ask'd me hastily the Reason of my Grief I told him Nothing  Come said he you know I will have the Truth therefore tell me without Delay I then finding he wou'd be satisfy'd told all that had pass'd between my Mother and me tho' in as tender Terms as I cou'd When my Father had heard me out he seem'd very much concern'd and making a long Pause at last cry'd Well I will have a Remedy And tomorrow continu'd he you shall go to your Uncle's who desires to see you where you shall remain till the Time of your Breakingup is over  The next Morning I had Orders to prepare for my Journey When I was ready to get on Horseback I waited on my Father who bid me go to my Mother and take my Leave of her I went but I must confess very unwillingly When I came to her DressingRoom I kneel'd down as usual upon which she said hastily  Bless you Bless you  which I  understood by her Manner of speaking was  Dammee Dammee  I am come Madam said I to take my Leave of you by my Father's Command Why pray Sir return'd my Mother very scornfully Where are you going To my Uncle's Madam said I Go then said she and a good Riddance I made my Honours and down Stairs I went again to my Father  Well  Will  said he what said your Mother to you Did she give you any thing No Sir said I she only gave me Leave to go about my Business Well said my Father you shall never trouble her again in the Mind I am in Go said he get on Horseback I'll ride before and conduct you some part of the Way  When I went into the Stable I heard my Brother  Jack  tell the Groom I must not have the Little Horse for it was his and he was to go abroad with his Mother Brother said I I must have him for my Father's gone before and will wait for me No matter for that said he you shan't have him Many Words pass'd between us and all the while he was endeavouring to get the Bridle out of my Hand but finding he was not strong enough he let go Just as I had got one  Foot in the Stirrup with a Prong that he had got out of the Stable he ran me into the Thigh with one of the Points the other piercing the Horse in the Flank who feeling himself hurt gave a Spring and before I cou'd get upon his Back he dragg'd me with one Foot in the Stirrup out into the Road and wou'd have certainly beat me to pieces if my Father coming back wondering at my Delay had not stop'd him The Servant told him I was certainly wounded for there were Streams of Blood upon the Ground Examining my Hurt they found my Boot was full of Blood I was carry'd in again tho' with Loss of Blood the Violence of the Fall together with the Dragging of the Horse I was deprived of my Senses for some time  A Surgeon was immediately sent for yet my Father was not presently inform'd how I came by the Hurt But when he knew the Truth of it he was so very much provok'd that just that Instant meeting with my Brother  Jack  coming up Stairs he kick'd him down again and in the Fall he broke his Arm I mention these little Circumstances only as they were the Occasion of  right Breach in the Family  When the Surgeon came he inform'd us there was no Danger but Loss of Blood and with a great many hard Words told 'em what a narrow Escape I had for if it had been an Inch higher and touch'd such and such a Thing all the World cou'd not have sav'd my Life to be sure  When he had made an end of dressing my Wound he went to the Assistance of my Brother The Servants had taken him up and brought him into the same Room where I was for our Beds were together I must own the Sight of him instead of moving my Pity stirr'd my Indignation and I was inwardly satisfy'd with my Father's just Revenge But while they were setting his Arm my Mother came among us alarm'd it seems with his Cries like one of the Furies with her Hair about her Ears out of her DressingRoom not having been acquainted with the Matter thro' the Confusion of the Family She cast many furious Eyes towards me and I believe if she had not been prevented by my Father had made me feel the Effects of her Indignation Madam said he I am sorry for the Accident that has happen'd to your Son not but he deserves it for his young wicked Intention tho' I don't  doubt but he was instigated by his Mother By me thou barbarous Wretch said she You are sorry for the Accident What Accident Did not you do it for the Purpose with an Intention to break his Neck I suppose But I'll be reveng'd on your young Darling with all his Learning Upon saying that she rush'd upon me in spite of 'em and seiz'd violently upon me endeavouring to tear me out of the Bed notwithstanding my weak Condition But my Father laid hold of her and with a Pull swung her to the farther end of the Room Now Madam said he since I see the Inveteracy of your Malice and having broke the Bonds of Duty Love and Tenderness I'll make you feel the Power of a Husband you shall be close confin'd to your Apartment never once to converse with Me or Mine You shall want nothing but your Liberty where you will have Time enough to reflect upon your Conduct and what it is to injure a Husband by your violent Proceedings So saying he seiz'd upon her maugre her Strugglings carry'd her to the Nursery and lock'd her in The Reason of his putting her there was as he said afterwards to prevent her making any Attempts to get out of the Windows being there were  Bars fix'd for fear of any Accident among us when we were under the Nurse's Care  Notwithstanding her Violence of Temper she had certainly at least in every Body's Opinion a tender Regard for my Father and if he did not return it he gave her no Cause to complain He had too much Humanity to use any one ill much less a Wife I have often heard him say While my Wife continues her Goodhumour to me she shall never find me in the least to blame in my Conduct to her but whenever that alters I shall have so much Regard to myself to be easy  During my Illness my Father was hardly ever from me I did not think it was proper for one of my Years to ask him any Questions concerning his Matrimonial Warfare but as he was sitting upon my Bed about the fifth Day of my Illness my Mother's Maid brought him a Letter which my Father perus'd then read it to me as follows  SIR  I  AM sensible the Serenity of Temper you have often promis'd to yourself if any Breach should happen between us gives you very great  Satisfaction whatever Uneasiness I feel But as I have Cause to believe the Burden will be weightier if you will not allow me one Favour which I am almost assur'd you will comply with that is to have the Company of my hurt Son in my Confinement besides Maternal Affections I believe there is another Motive which convinces me I shall not be deny'd you will get rid of an Object which cannot but be ungrateful to you because it belongs to One who formerly thought it her chiefest Happiness to be call'd  Yours  Confinement I find said my Father is a good Mortifier but I shall very willingly comply with her Request upon your Account for I can't suppose it is very pleasing to you to have always before your Eyes the Cause of your Pain and Illness Sir said I there is no Motive more prevalent with me than the Satisfaction of my Mother besides I hope I have it not in my Nature to bear Malice therefore I have long since forgiven my Brother imagining it to be only the Heat of Passion and Want of Years My Child said my Father your Years are the  same both in your Thirteenth and yet I am convinc'd he has not the Consideration that thou hast which I am pleas'd with not for his Want of Understanding but that thine seems to exceed thy Years Pray Heaven continue it Sir said I 'tis all I ask the Blessing of Heaven and You in having them I shall want nothing but possess'd with all the Gifts of Fortune wanting them I shall be poor indeed My Boy said my Father and kiss'd me once more Heaven bless thee Grant that I may be able to provide for thee according to my Inclination  By this time the Maid who had retir'd while my Father was perusing the Letter came in to expect an Answer Tell your Mistress said my Father I shall comply with her Request as I shall to all others that are reasonable Upon this Answer the Maid went out and my Father gave immediate Orders to remove the Boy Then with a gentle Press by the Hand took his Leave of me I must own I was very much delighted at his Expressions of Kindness to me being it was what I never receiv'd from him before 'Tis true he never us'd me harshly but he did not seem to me to have the least Regard or playing and toying with Children  as I have known Parents do his Manner of Behaviour to me before begot Respect in me it was enough if he did but look at me to make me observe him tho' I can't fansy it is a proper Carriage from a Parent to a Child neither the way to beget Obedience there is a kind of Indulgence to the harmless Follies of Children that insensibly wins the Affections of the Child I remember my own Brother that was one Year elder than me never car'd to come in my Father's Sight which proceeded from his stiff Behaviour to us But I am not laying down Rules or Examples between Parents and Children tho' really I think some Parents want as much Instruction that way as their Children Tho' I am wellassur'd my Father had a tender Regard for his notwithstanding his rigid Behaviour for he punish'd severely for Faults openly and as I found afterwards rewarded 'em secretly when they did well But my Readers may with Reason say this is but little to the Purpose  In the next Visit my Father made me he told me he fansy'd my Mother had a great mind to be making her Peace but added he  Will  I'll take care if it comes to that you shall be included in the Treaty I told  him I should be pleas'd let it go which way it wou'd if he wou'd be so I have receiv'd another Letter since Morning said he with her Desire to speak with me in the Evening I shall comply with her Request and the Result of our Conference thou shalt know tomorrow Morning for added he it will be late before I can go to her for I expect your Schoolmaster this Evening who is to stay all Night on purpose to see you as he sends me Word And accordingly before Night the good old Man came to condole with me and in some sort to chide me in neglecting to tell him of my Brother's Want of Learning However said he I forgive you and have prevail'd on your Father that I may have you again for I should be much concern'd to lose the Flower of my Flock as he was pleas'd to call me As for your Brother  Jack  added he I have advis'd with your Father to prevail on your Mother to put him out to some creditable Trade and not longer to lose his Time in fruitless Endeavours to learn what he can never attain to for continu'd he I have just now been examining him in the Garden for as he had the Use of his Legs he cou'd go any where but I am in the utmost Confusion to find him such a Dunce and  that I cou'd be so long impos'd on between you  I begg'd my Master to mention my Folly no more for I assur'd him it was Want of Thought and Tenderness to him that occasion'd the Deceit I had sufficiently repented of it and if it was to come over again wou'd sooner die than be guilty of any such Proceedings I added It was the greatest Grief I ever did or ever shou'd feel that from so trivial a thing as I thought such Difference shou'd be created between my Father and Mother Rest contented reply'd my Master Thy Motherinlaw has prov'd what I always thought her a turbulentspirited Woman only she had Art enough to hide it so long from your Father Indeed her first Husband Sir  Charles  many Years ago hinted some such thing to me I am pleas'd she has declar'd herself upon so slight an Occasion that your good Father may be arm'd in time against her Contrivances for I am apt to believe even her Affection to him is only counterfeited and once Women can counterfeit Love I give 'em lost to all virtuous Principles their Endearments are the worst of Crimes and the greatest Affront they can put upon a Man I have known  some Women who have prov'd false to their Husband's Bed yet have carry'd it with such a Tenderness and Regard to them that if the World had not been convinc'd of their Baseness 'twere enough to call Truth a Lyar  I interrupted my Master by telling him I thought there was no Grounds even for Suspicion of any such thing concerning my Mother I hope so too reply'd my Schoolmaster  After some other Discourse of the Weaknesses of Women he left me to my own Thoughts but I must own they were not very pleasing ones I began to consider my Condition If my Mother prov'd an ill Woman as I had some reason to suspect from the Hints and Discourses of my Master I shou'd certainly suffer in the end for if my Father was reconcil'd to her through her Cunning I did not doubt but she would improve it and make me the Butt of her Resentment and notwithstanding my Father's good Sense and Knowledge of the World there was not an Impossibility but he might fall into the Snares of a subtle designing Woman The Thought of this spread a melancholy Cloud over my Face which was perceiv'd by my Father who enter'd in the midst of my Cogitations  How now  Will  said he does thy Wound pain thee that thou look'st with such a sorrowful Countenance No Sir said I I was only enter'd into thinking of what may happen for the future and the Fear of losing your Kindness made me sad Well said he as I am assur'd from your Behaviour that will never happen I hope your Concern will cease I told you continu'd my Father when I parted with you last that I wou'd not let thee know the Result of the Interview till the Morning but as we are reconcil'd I cou'd not so long delay thee thy Part of the Satisfaction Tomorrow in the Morning thy Mother thy Master and all of us are to come into thy Room to Breakfast where I hope all Animosities will cease On my Side Sir said I they were never begun nor ever shall without my Temper and Inclination shou'd be inverted I believe there's no Danger of that reply'd my Father and so my good Boy Goodnight  As soon as my Father was gone my Master came in again  Billy  said he I cou'd not go to Bed without seeing you to desire since your Father and Mother are reconcil'd to take no manner of Notice of the Discourse you and I had together concerning her If  told him without any Caution it shou'd have been as secret as if no one had known it but himself I believe it said he yet I thought Caution might have been necessary and so bid me Goodnight  When I was once more left alone Reflexion began to be stronger than before and weighing according to my young Judgment the Affairs and Condition of the Family thought verily my Circumstances wou'd suffer by it I was in the midst of a thousand confus'd ungrateful Thoughts when the Surgeon came in to dress me and viewing my Wound was very much surpriz'd to see it look so angry I am afraid young Gentleman said he you have met with something today that makes you uneasy or have tasted something that you shou'd not have done which occasions this Alteration in your Hurt Pray said he what have you had to eat today When I inform'd him That said he cou'd never hurt you the Alteration I perceive must proceed from some Disturbance of Mind and I value my Patient so much that I must know the Cause that I may speak to your Father to have it remedy'd I found him so pressing that I was oblig'd to tell him Some little Accidents in the Family had given  me some Uneasiness which were now reconcil'd and wou'd soon be forgot Yes said he I hear your Father and Mother are come to an Agreement and I can't say I am over well pleas'd at it for if she does not play him and all of you some Trick I'll be hang'd I have Reasons best known to myself for what I say  I am sorry said I you have any secret Reason to suspect my Mother's future Conduct and without you disclose 'em to me I shall imagine they are Chimaeras of your own Brain that flow from your too much Drinking for he was fam'd for a great To  er or otherwise from her refusing you the Cure of my Brother  Jack  for when my Motherinlaw heard he was my Surgeon her Resentment run so high that she wou'd not employ him  Nothing of all this I can assure you return'd the Surgeon but I shall say no more at present 'till I have observ'd her future Behaviour and if she deserves it I shall disclose some things that will be very surprizing  o all of you I wish said I you wou'd ei  her have mention'd nothing of it now or wou'd resolve to tell me what it is you know or I fear if you leave me in doubt it will not at all help me in the Cure  I am sorry return'd the Surgeon I have inadvertently said any thing to make you uneasy but to reconcile you to your Rest tonight be assur'd whenever I disclose it 'twill help you rather than injure you and tho' I have many Follies I have Discretion enough to keep this a Secret till it shall prove advantageous to your Father and you  I us'd many Arguments to persuade him to let me know this great Secret but all to no purpose so after he had dress'd me he left me with more Cause of Uneasiness than I had before which I too plainly shew'd by my Countenance The Maid who attended me in my Illness who was one that liv'd with my Mother in her Lifetime and had the bringing of me up told me I should not be uneasy at what the Surgeon said he was nothing but a meer Rattle for it was his usual way to make People imagine he knew something concerning their Affairs and when he came to be strictly examin'd deny'd it all or made an Excuse that he suppos'd he was drunk when he said so  What the Maid said seem'd probable enough yet I cou'd not put it out of my Head that notwithstanding his Character there was something in his Knowledge concerning our Family  The Thought of this with other Affairs kept me from sleeping many Hours and when I did it was broken and interrupted with frightful Dreams In one I thought my Mother invited my Father and me to walk with her in a Garden at the End there was a prodigious high Mountain which we ascended with much Difficulty and when we had gain'd the Summit my Mother gave my Father a Push down the Brow of the Mountain on the other Side where my troubled Fancy gave him for lost She then flew towards me and violently thrust me down the same way we came up I thought I fell to the Bottom much bruis'd as also scratch'd by Brambles and Stones that lay in my way that the Pain I felt awak'd me I told my Dream to the Maid that sat up with me she reply'd it was nothing but a disturb'd Fancy with the Pain of my Hurt and begg'd I wou'd compose myself to Sleep which after some time I did  I reassum'd my Dream where I left off My sleeping Imagination represented my Mother on the Brow of the Hill hurling Stones and Clods of Earth at me yet I thought none of 'em came near me to do me any Damage and as she was endeavouring  to come down the Hill in order as I thought to hurt me she vanish'd away but I cou'd not perceive which way she went Upon the Instant I awoke in a very great Agony when I told the Maid the Cause of my Uneasiness she laugh'd at me and said 'twas only form'd from my uneasy Thoughts Whatever she cou'd say to me upon the Invalidity of Dreams I cou'd not put this out of my Head nor go to sleep again and the rest of our Discourse till Morning was Stories of Dreams proving true which I had oft heard repeated but she call'd those things  Visions  I would have persuaded her mine was such but she laugh'd me out of it or at least I had Discretion enough to say no more to her concerning it whatever were my Thoughts about it  When the Time of Breakfast came my Father enter'd the Room and ask'd me how I had rested last Night the Maid answer'd for me that I had been disturb'd by frightful Dreams my Father return'd he had none of the best but continu'd he Dreams were the only Work of a disturb'd Fancy and were as far from Truth as the GlowWorm's dim Shine from Light and Heat the Creatures of the drowsy Brain  But Sir said I many have been forewarn'd by Dreams of Accidents that have happen'd to 'em witness  Calphurnia  's Dream of the  Butchery  of  Caesar  and  Ceasar  's Dream before he overcame  Pompey  or that mention'd by  Valerius Maximus  of the two  Arcadians  Valerius Maximus  in his Account of  Dreams  gives this particular one Two  Arcadians  Friends to each other travelling together came to the City of  Megara  in the Province of  Achaia  formerly a Dependant on the  Athenians  One of 'em went to lodge at a Friend's House the other at a Public Inn The Person that lay at his Friend's in his Sleep fansy'd he heard his Companion call out for Help from the Violence of his Landlord which awak'd him and stamp'd such an Impression on his Mind that he rose and endeavour'd to find out the Inn But Fortune not allowing him that Happiness he went to his Lodging and address'd himself to Sleep again laughing to himself that a Dream shou'd so much disturb him When Sleep had once more taken Possession of his Faculties he dreamt that his Friend came to his Bedside cover'd with Wounds who told him That since Fate had not permitted him to prevent his End he hop'd he wou'd see his Death reveng'd My Body said the Apparition is now carrying in a Cart cover'd with Rubbish out of the Gate of the City by the Innkeeper who murder'd me for my Money Arise and bring him to the Punishment he deserves The friendly  Arcadian  at this Second Warning arose and taking Assistance with him stopp'd the Innkeeper with the Cart where he found the bleeding Body of his Friend The Man confess'd his Guilt and was executed accordingly  Nothing Child reply'd my Father  but the Fancy of Poets and Historians and I hope you have Understanding enough to slight 'em 'tis nothing but superstitious Opinion that gives any Credit to Dreams and Omens but continu'd he I wou'd have thee put on a more pleasing Countenance for thy Mother Brother and I are coming presently to Breakfast with thee in order for a Reconciliation on all Hands and if she perceives that Cloud upon thy Face she will be apt to conjecture her Presence is irksome to thee I reply'd I would do my Endeavour to be compos'd as indeed I had Reason but I told him I wou'd ever have my Face the  Index  of my Heart for I shou'd find it a very hard Task to counterfeit any Passion Well said my Father smiling we shall be with you presently and went out  When he was gone I resolv'd to rise and put on my Gown in order to receive such a Visit decently tho' the Maid wou'd have dissuaded me I was but just dress'd and set down in mv Chair for I was not able to stand when my Father Mother and her Son enter'd  the Chamber As soon as my Mother came in she said to my Father he had inform'd her I had kept my Bed Indeed my Dear return'd my Father I am something surpriz'd for I left him in Bed not a Quarter of an Hour ago I answer'd that I thought it my Duty to come as near my Knees as I cou'd and I hop'd my Mother wou'd pardon the Posture I was in but I threw an humble Heart at her Feet and hop'd she wou'd give me her Blessing with her Pardon Heaven bless thee said she my Dear and for Pardon 'tis I ought to ask that of thee who have really offended but acknowledging a Fault is the Way to Repentance and all my Hope is we shall bury in Oblivion past Transactions She then brought my Brother forward who told me with a cloudy Countenance He begg'd my Pardon and wou'd do so no more I told him I had long since learnt to forget every thing for Forgiveness was not a Word became a Child's Mouth We all kiss'd round  When our mutual Caresses were over I cou'd perceive Tears of Joy stand in my Father's Eyes for this our Reconciliation and I imagin'd my Mother's Countenance look'd with a pleasing Contentment in't But alas  'tis hard to know the Heart of Woman A fair Face with a smiling Countenance often harbour Rancour in the Soul and as they study to set off their Features they also study to make their Face a Mask to their Mind  They staid with me some time nor perhaps had gone so soon if Word had not been brought in that the Surgeon was come to dress me My Mother begg'd Leave to retire telling me she had not Courage enough to support the Sight of my Hurt so my Father led her out and my Brother follow'd 'em  Immediately after the Surgeon came in Well said he I find all's right again I met your Father leading your Mother through the Hall as if he had just begun to court her I wish it may hold on her Side I hope there is no Fear of it said I but I can assure you what you hinted to me Yesterday has given me a great deal of Uneasiness  Think on't no more return'd the Surgeon think on't no more Master I am very sorry I mention'd any thing to you and beg you wou'd speak of it no more How said I do you endeavour to calumniate Persons out of a Whim of your Brain and not expect  to be call'd to an Account for it I have been inform'd of your Temper or rather the Villainy of your opprobrious Tongue and can farther assure you that the chimerical Aspersions you wou'd endeavour to fix upon my Motherinlaw shall not go unpunish'd if my Father retains his usual Spirit unless you this Moment tell the Truth and either make out what you wou'd insinuate or clear her by asking Pardon for the Injury you wou'd have done her  The Surgeon seem'd very much in Confusion during my Speech to him which I observing did not doubt but it was as the Maid said his constant Custom to calumniate every Body  I see said I by the Confusion in your Countenance you seem'd to confess your Error I'll give you my Word to mention what has past between you and I to no one on condition for the future you'll leave off that vile Custom of aspersing the Characters of every Body you know for it may prove of dangerous Consequence to other People as well as yourself and it's a Crime neither becoming a Christian or a Man  Sir return'd the Surgeon I must own to you you have open'd my Eyes more by your  Discourse than all that I have ever had said to me upon the like Occasion and the vile Trick has crept upon me through Custom for come where you will even all Sexes Ages and Degrees are fond of hearing a little Scandal and willing to know the Frailties of their Neighbours not considering the Parasite to the next Company makes as free with the last he came from and I must own the Success I have met with or indeed the Willingness of my Hearers have often put me upon inventing Stories to please my Patients and their Families But I now repent and am resolv'd never to be guilty of the like again and my Repentance is owing to your Advice After this he ran on with many Encomiums of the Ripeness of my Understanding and a long Rigmerole of nothing to the Purpose But said he concerning your Mother I know something that I am sure wou'd cause great Uneasiness in the Family yet I beg you wou'd not insist upon knowing any thing farther for the Character I perceive I have got in the World wou'd fly in my Face and spoil my Evidence till I can plainly prove what I say which if I ever see there is a Necessity for it I can in a few Days bring to pass I strove many ways  to get something out of him but it prov'd to no purpose yet I verily believ'd he knew somewhat against the Reputation of my Motherinlaw  When he was gone I began to lose my+self in confus'd Thoughts and Notions as I had formerly done which gave me vail Uneasiness that led me to imagine my Mother's Conduct to my Father and me all an Artifice this put me upon a Resolution of observing nicely her Carriage that I might be able to form my Behaviour afterwards  We liv'd very lovingly together a whole Year and I began to bury all my Fears imagining still the Surgeon had wrongfully aspers'd my Mother Therefore I apply'd myself hard to my Studies with my Tutor for since the first Falling out my Father wou'd not let us go to School any more but provided a Tutor for us in the House tho' he cou'd make nothing of my Brother  John  for he was resolv'd to remain a Dunce which did not a little grieve both my Father and Mother but there was no Remedy Therefore  John  was resolv'd for behind the Counter The Time was fix'd to put him Apprentice to a Mercer and me to the University I cou'd easily perceive this Resolution  tho' both Father and Motherinlaw seem'd to consent to it was a great Grief to my Mother and in a few Days I was confirm'd in't  At the End of our Garden was a large SummerHouse which I frequently made my Place of Study having just made an end of  Claudian  I was going into the House to fetch another Book but perceiving my Mother at the End of one of the Walks in order as I suppos'd to come into the SummerHouse I step'd behind it that I might not meet her When she came near me I cou'd perceive by her Countenance she was mightily disturb'd She staid in the Walk for her Maid a few Minutes when she came to her they both went up into the SummerHouse I found they were deep in Discourse therefore must own I had Curiosity enough to listen awhile but they spoke so low that I cou'd only hear now and then a Word but yet enough to pick out it concern'd my Brother  John  and my  Self    I had left my  Claudian  above in the Window of the SummerHouse which my Mother perceiving took it up  Ha  said she  this I suppose is some of the Jackanapes  's  Books Ay 'tis  Latin  I believe 'tis his  Well I'll take care he shall have Reading enough I'll warrant him  And then spoke so low that I cou'd not hear the rest I listen'd farther but whether they mistrusted somebody was near 'em or they were consulting something that was wicked I can't tell but they spoke so low that I cou'd not hear any thing but a continual Humming between 'em  I went to my Study but had no Inclination to read my Head run too much upon what I had heard and what I suggested the more I thought the more Reason I had to be uneasy I sent a Servant to the SummerHouse for the Book I had forgot when he return'd I ask'd him if there was any body in the SummerHouse he answer'd There was my  Lady  and Mrs  Betty  in close Conference and farther added they look'd upon him with damn'd four Countenances for disturbing 'em as he suppos'd  I found every thing concurr'd with my Thoughts which added very much to my discontented Mind When my Tutor came in he perceiv'd by my Looks my Spirits were discompos'd and pressing me to know the Reason I told him I was not very well At Supper for my Tutor being a Gentleman of  a good Family that had suffer'd many Misfortunes in the World my Father allow'd him the Privilege of eating with us he desir'd my Father to order me a little Physick for I had complain'd I was indispos'd My Father press'd me to take it on the next Morning but I told him it was nothing but too much Reading and I shou'd be well presently but if I found myself worse I wou'd take Physic in a Day or two Ay says my Mother whether you are better or no you ought to take Physic this Springtime and  Johnny  shall take some along with you So it was agreed in two Days to take it and Word was sent to the Apothecary's accordingly tho' I resolv'd with myself not to take any as believing I wanted none mine being an Illness of the Mind When the Time came the Doses were sent us but I convey'd mine away without taking it  At Dinner my Mother seem'd as I thought to look thro' me and ask'd me many Questions concerning the Operation I answer'd her as I thought proper As she ask'd her Maid who always waited on her alone for a Glass of Wine I observ'd she look'd upon her with an odd sort of a Countenance the Maid seem'd to return her another  Look which plainly told me there was a Meaning between 'em But the Discourse was turn'd on another Subject as being not altogether so proper at Dinner yet every now and then my Mother wou'd come out with  Sure  Billy  you did not take your Physic  I confidently told her I did tho' I abhor a Lye Many odd Looks pass'd every Moment between the Mistress and the Maid during Dinner When it was ended they both went up into her DressingRoom I cou'd not help following 'em with my Eyes and secretly wish'd I cou'd have been near enough to hear their Conversation but as that could not be I was oblig'd to be contented without it  In a little time my Mother came down again after some short Stay in the DiningRoom my Father Mother Brother  John  and I as usual went to walk in the Garden  John  as was his Custom ran scampering before and plaid many of his childish Tricks Why  Billy  said my Father why don't you do as your Brother  Jacky  does 'twill make you strong and lusty all Study will spoil you weaken your Constitution ay and impair your Health So it will reply'd my good Mother I don't think he has  a good State of Health for he seems to me as if he were in a Consumption observe how pale he looks Ay but return'd my Father that may be his Physic I don't know but it may says she but if I might advise he shou'd take more in a few Days as well as  Jacky  for I am assur'd 'twill do 'em good Nay further my Dear said she to my Father I intend to see  Billy  take his for it runs in my Head he made away that he was to take in the Morning for I know he hates Physic I endeavour'd to convince her of the contrary which she seem'd to believe  The Time drew near that we were to take Physic again and I was putting my Invention on the Stretch how to avoid it for I found she had resolv'd to be by when we were to take it which accordingly happen'd When she gave me mine I let it slip out of my Hand upon the Ground this put her into such a Passion that she gave me a Box on the Ear but in a little time after she begg'd my Pardon kiss'd me put her Hand to her Purse and gave me half a Guinea desiring I wou'd forget it I promis'd her I wou'd tho' I really cou'd not  When my Father came in she told him in a merry Manner I was resolv'd not to take any Physic for the young Rogue said she let it slip through his Fingers which convinces me he play'd the same Trick with that the other Morning I told my Father it was purely Accident Well well  Billy  said my Motherinlaw let it be what it will we shall take care of the next I warrant you I don't know when that can be my Dear said my Father for he must go to his Uncle's this Afternoon who begs to see him and I can't tell when he will return My Mother made no Answer to it but seem'd to be in much Confusion  I was very well pleas'd to go to my Uncle's not only to get rid of my Mother's Physic but to see him who was more indulgent to me than my own Father and it was thought by every one that I shou'd be his Heir for he was an old Batchelor and never intended to marry  While I was in my Study pleasing myself with the Thoughts of going to my Uncle's my Father came in to me  Billy  said he thy Mother has convinc'd me 'tis necessary you shou'd take Physic before you go so that I have sent an Excuse to your Uncle and let  him know you will wait on him in two or three Days at farthest I was confounded at what he said yet I answer'd him What he pleas'd I cou'd not tell him what I thought of my Mother and that I believ'd she intended to give me something to injure me for as it cou'd not be prov'd it wou'd look only like Fear or Malice so I e'en set myself to think how to avoid it  At last I thought to get a Phial the same Size of that she brought me in the Morning and fill it with something near the Colour which seem'd to me to be a dark Brown But then the Difficulty wou'd be how to put the Change upon her In the Morning I had prepar'd my Phial and when my Mother was going to pour it into a Glass for me to drink I begg'd she wou'd be pleas'd to let me drink it out of the Phial for the Sight of it in a Glass turn'd my Stomach against it Ay my Dear with all my Heart any how so thou dost but take it reply'd my good Mother When I had got it I put the Change upon her and drank what I had prepar'd My Mother seem'd mightily pleas'd taking her Leave of me with a  It's a good Child keep thyself warm my Dear  When she was gone I went into my Study  and began to examine the Bottle my Mother wou'd have had me taken I found it had no ill Smell but as I had not any Inclination to taste it I had Thoughts of trying the Experiment upon some dumb Creature but cou'd not find in my Heart to be so cruel yet had a vast Inclination to know its Effects At last I resolv'd to give it to a Greyhound Bitch whose Surliness had given me Occasion enough not to have any great Compassion for her I did not think it proper to do it in the House so took my Opportunity to wheedle her into the Stable when no one was there but going to open her Jaws to pour it into her Mouth she flew at me and ran away In the Surprize I let the Phial fall out of my Hand which broke with the Fall I was very uneasy I cou'd not make Proof of what I design'd for I knew it wou'd be to no purpose to discover my Suspicions only  When Dinnertime came I was call'd down and observ'd the Confusion of Faces were increas'd between the Mistress and the Maid insomuch that my Father cou'd not help taking Notice of it Pray my Dear what has  Betty  said my Father done for you look at her as if she had committed some  great Crime What I warrant she has not wash'd your Headcloaths to please you or some such Trifle She knows what she has done said my Motherinlaw well enough but I don't think it worth my While to be angry about it Well but don't give her such sour Look then return'd my Father but pardon her you'll spoil her Stomach to her Dinner Child My Father went on in a jocose manner all Dinnertime yet notwithstanding now and then Looks past between 'em that no body cou'd interpret but myself or at least I thought I cou'd I see my Dear cry'd my Father the Peace is not made up between you give me Leave to be the Judge in this Matter but first let me know the Case Come  Betty  continu'd my Father you seem to be the Offender confess your Crime and that's the Way to find Pardon the sooner Why Sir return'd the Maid I have forgot to wash my Mistress's Lac'd Pinners for which she has been angry with me all this Morning And is this the full and whole History of her Crime my Dear said my Father to my Motherinlaw Yes return'd the good Woman Why then I proceed to Judgment said my Father  You Mrs  Betty  not having the Fear of God before your Eyes  c  here my Father ran on with the whole Sentence that a Judge repeats to one arraign'd for Murder and during the time of Speaking I observ'd  Betty  to be very much startled shall for your Punishment before you sleep wash and starch these same Headcloaths and in so doing it shall remain as a sufficient Punishment for your heinous Crime tho' you know you deserve much worse and be sure for the future you are never guilty of the like  Betty  promis'd in a great deal of Confusion to mend for the future  The next Day was design'd for me to wait on my Uncle and tho' I had a great Desire to go yet I was not satisfy'd I was in various Minds sometimes I fully intended to inform my Father with my Suspicions with all the Circumstances and Grounds for't But then again I consider'd my Suspicions might strengthen my Opinion and they might be really innocent While I was wrapt in my Cogitations I observ'd my Mother and her Maid were going into the Garden and I did not doubt but they wou'd get into the Summer House in order to another Conference I slipt into the Garden and got to my HidingPlace  behind the JessamineHedge before they came As soon as they were up the Stairs of the SummerHouse my Mother ask'd her Maid if she were assur'd there was no one in the Garden she told her No nor none cou'd come in but she cou'd perceive 'em from the Window where she sat  What can be the Meaning said my Mother that this devilish Brat does not feel the Effects of what he has taken I am afraid either the Apothecary or you have betray'd me Madam return'd the Maid I can assure you we are both innocent of your Suspicion As for his Part he does not know who or what it's for Yet Madam I don't doubt but you'll be surpris'd at what I am going to say to you  I wou'd not continu'd  Betty  be guilty of what before Dinner I made no Scruple of for the whole World If you had observ'd my Countenance while my Master was judging my fictitious Crime with the formal Introductions in Cases of Murder you might have read my Guilt in my Face I am assur'd Master  Billy  observ'd me most heedfully and to my thinking his Eyes told me he knew my real Crime in the Intention I was some time before I cou'd recover my  Confusion and I then weigh'd in the Scales of Justice the Reason of your Resentment  o him and found the Intention to be the utmost Wickedness and I thank'd my God our  nhuman Designs had not taken effect You see Heaven is displeas'd and shews the Abhorrence of the Fact by hindring the Effect I look'd in his Face during the latter Part of Dinner and wonder'd how we cou'd plot to take away the Life of so mucn Innocence that never injur'd us I thank Heaven my Eyes are open'd nor even the worst of Torments shou'd make me once think of such a Crime Therefore let me beg of you my dear Mistress to forget it bury even the Thought of it Consider the Crime  Murder  is the greatest Sin against God 'tis even striking at him by murdering his Image Let my Repentance be as the Alarm to yours I am sure if you will give yourself time to think your Conscience must awake and teach you to abhor the Crime No one knows our wicked Intention but allseeing Heaven which will pardon us on a sincere Repentance We are oblig'd to keep each other's Counsel therefore let me conjure you by the Love you ought to owe your Husband by your Duty to Heaven which I  shou'd have mention'd first by the Worth of your eternal Soul by the Affection you ought to owe your Children for those of your Husbands must be yours since you are but One Consider what it is to have a clear and a quiet Conscience 'tis the only Happiness on this side the Grave 'tis that which sweetens all the Ills of Life the Innocent will be happy let Fortune empty her Quiver of Malice on 'em If the Weight of this will have no Consideration with you think on the Welfare of this World if you can lull to sleep your Conscience Murder has many Tongues to speak even things inanimate have divulg'd the Guilty and when once reveal'd think on the Punishment that must follow I beg Madam take some little time to ruminate on what I have said before you answer me weigh it well for it is of the last Importance for tho' a poor ignorant weak Woman you'll find what I utter to be the Oracle of Heaven  Here  Betty  paus'd as expecting an Answer and during the Interval of Speech the Agonies I felt at the intended Wickedness were next to Death itself After about a Minute's Silence my Mother spoke as follows  Betty  Words can hardly speak the Torments of my Mind yet I have this to comfort me 'tis in Repentance to set my Soul at rest and I do repent from the Bottom of my Heart What a Fiend had I entertain'd in my Breast How very near the Brink of Hell his proper Habitation had he brought me Thou wert my GuardianAngel that sav'd me from Destruction To Heaven and Thee I owe my Thanks Now this Fury is gone forth my Bosom I think with thee how it cou'd be possible to harbour such a Hellish Thought against the poor Child but now I feel reviving Love even equal to that of my own Son I long to embrace and kiss him with a real Mother's Fondness  The Joy I felt at this Declaration had almost made me discover myself and it was hard to keep my Legs from running to my Mother to accept the long'dfor Blessing but Reason got the better of my Transport That told me I ought to conceal from all the World my Knowledge of the whole Affair While I was in my Musing I cou'd hear  Betty  say Madam my Master's coming up the Walk I beg you will compose yourself I'll do what I can reply'd my Motherinlaw but no one can imagine what Torments  I feel Then sit here Madam said  Betty  for here it's dark and my Master cannot perceive your Disorder My Mother as I suppos'd remov'd to the Place she desir'd her Immediately after my Father came in and ask'd 'em if they had seen me for they had been searching me all over the House but cou'd not find me My Brother's Man said my Father is waiting for him My Mother reply'd I had not been there but must certainly be in the Study No said my Father he is not there neither can I imagine where he can be and the not finding him makes me very uneasy  Upon saying this my Father went up and down the Walks calling me When he had left the two Women  Betty  cry'd out I hope in Heaven my Repentance is accepted and he has not now felt the Effect of the Poison You fright me out of my Senses return'd my Mother let's run to seek him Away they went When I was certain they were out of Sight I clamber'd over the Wall and came in the Street way just as my Mother with her Maid came out of the Garden As soon as my Mother met me she clasp'd me about the Neck and kiss'd me with as much Transport as if I had been her own Son  which affected me in such a manner I could not help weeping with Excess of Satisfaction What means these Tears my Child said my Mother Madam said I be not offended they are Tears of Joy to see you so kind Bless thee my dear Boy return'd my Mother I hope always to prove so  When my Father came in he ask'd me where I had been I told him only to take a Walk in the Fields after my Physic We thought we had lost you said my Father and were sending for the Cryer to cry a great Boy of Fifteen Years of Age But come continu'd he mount your Uncle's Man waits for you and has done this Hour Your Things shall be there tomorrow Morning I begg'd Leave only to pack up a few Books and I wou'd wait on him instantly  As I was in my Study putting together what I intended to take with me  Betty  came up to me Well Sir said me how do you find yourself after your Physic Better than was expected this Morning  Betty  said I I am very glad on't reply'd  Betty  I now believe you are said I but there's a great Alteration since Morning and I hope it will continue While I said this I look'd stedfastly in her Face she observing me blush'd  very much Come  Betty  said I 'tis never too late to repent Repent Sir reply'd  Betty  of what Of doing Ill I return'd or even thinking Ill I had but an ill Opinion of you this Morning but I have Reason to think I have done you Wrong and I ask you Pardon be satisfy'd I can sometimes read Peoples Thoughts Why then said  Betty  if it be so you know you have no Reason to ask my Pardon for I am sure you never offended me But if I have ever offended you I ask you and Heaven Pardon and I hope I shall obtain both Be assur'd you will I reply'd She seeing me ready to go down took her Leave of me modestly begging leave to kiss me As I was going away Sir said she if we both are alive ten Year hence and I have the Honour to see you I may make you acquainted with something very extraordinary Nothing but what I partly understand already I return'd keep in the honest Path you are in then Heaven will bless you  I got on Horseback after taking Leave of the Family and observ'd  Betty  in much Confusion I shook my Head at her with a Smile and rid away  When I arriv'd at my Uncle's which was about fourteen Miles from my Father's I was told by the Servants he was gone out a little way not expecting me so soon but he wou'd return in a Quarter of an Hour During his Stay a Coach came to the Door with a couple of old Ladies and a young one about thirteen Years of Age the beautifullest Creature my Eyes ever beheld I cou'd not help gazing upon her with a great deal of Delight They came to visit my Uncle but finding he was gone out wou'd not stay I look'd after the Coach which carry'd this young Angel away as far as ever I cou'd see and began to feel a certain Tenderness which People I thought of my Years had but little Knowledge of  I was pleasing myself with the charming Idea when my Uncle came in who exprest a great deal of Satisfaction to see me After the first Civilities were over I told him there was a Coach with some Ladies to wait upon him but not meeting with him at home wou'd not come in My Uncle being a merry jocose Man said to me Sirrah you shou'd have done the Duties of my House and  made  'em come in But who were they I told him I cou'd not tell But the Servant  reply'd They were my Lady her Sister and Daughter Odso you young Dog return'd my Uncle there wou'd be a fine Wife if you had but Money enough she's an Heiress and will be worth Fifty Thousand Pounds Well Sir said I when I think on Marriage I must not turn my Thoughts that way No why so reply'd my Uncle a Woman with a Fortune is as soon got as one without and when I die you don't know what may happen  Sir said I if I never marry till I wish your Death I hope to live single a great while I believe thee  Will  said my Uncle But 'tis time enough to talk of these things ten Year hence I wou'd have no Man marry till they are past Twenty nor Women till past Sixteen I wonder Sir said I you never thought of that State Why you young Rogue so I have reply'd my Uncle so much on't that I resolve to live single all my Life and I am of the Opinion few People marry only to better their Condition That's a little too hard Sir said I Do you imagine no one marries for Love O yes a great many reply'd my Uncle but it does not last long Lovers have large Stomachs but are soon cloy'd they very often surfeit the  first Meal I told him My Mother his Sister I thought lov'd my Father till the Day of her Death She was contented I believe reply'd my Uncle But come young Man this Discourse is a little too wise for one of your Years Not at all said I Uncle I hope you will not take it ill if I declare your Notions of Matrimony won't hinder me to try my Fortune when my Inclination serves and a good Match shou'd offer No said my Uncle I hope to see thee wedded to a good Fortune before I die therefore I intend to carry thee to my Lady  S  and there you may grow acquainted with the young Lady your Age is much the same and your Correspondence may be continu'd as your Years increase beside I wou'd have you have some Place to go to for it wou'd be hard to have nothing but an old musty Uncle to converse with Age does not very well agree with Youth  Our Conversation lasted much longer upon this Topic and it might have lasted longer than it did if Supper had not come in to stop my Uncle's Mouth His Housekeeper sat down at Supper with us which I thought a little odd but I soon found how Matters went and young as I was I cou'd perceive  Madam was Mistress of the Family She appear'd extremely civil to me even as I thought too civil for her Behaviour seem'd to say  Observe I am Mistress of the House and 'tis to me you are beholden for your Entertainment    The next Day I cou'd not help hinting to my Uncle something of his Housekeeper's Behaviour Why  Billy  said my Uncle this Woman is a good Woman in her Way and I shou'd be at a great Loss without her for as I have many Servants and being a single Man I shou'd be but a scurvy Manager of 'em Now this Woman being prudent and discreet knows how to manage such a Kennel of wild Hounds as I am forc'd to keep out of State indeed for I have not Service for 'em half But a Man of Fortune must live something answerable to it or he will be despis'd by his Neighbours Once a Man has got in that Road he must not get out of it again  Sir said I I beg your Pardon for being so inquisitive and may be impertinent  Billy  reply'd my Uncle you may say and do just what you will here for I wou'd have you to understand this House and all that's in it is not only yours when I die but the  Estate that belongs to it which is upward of Two Thousand Pounds a Year and to convince you of it I design to make my Will forthwith I have so much Confidence in you to believe I shall never have Occasion to alter it I beg you Sir said I don't talk of making of Wills and Death 'tis a melancholy Subject and whatever you will be pleas'd to leave me will not compensate the Grief I shou'd feel for the Loss of so good an Uncle Why you Fool reply'd my Uncle I believe you but I hope a Man is never the nearer Death for talking on't or making his Will  We were interrupted in our Discourse by a Servant's giving my Uncle a Letter which he read to himself and smil'd Here said my Uncle read that there's a Billet whose Style may be altogether new to you 'tis wrote by a young Lady and a fine Lady tho' dictated by an old one I took it and read as follows  Mr IRONFACE  WE all think you a goodfornothing fusty old Fellow as indeed all old Batchelors are which is the only Motive prevails upon us to forgive your being abroad Yesterday  when we came to wait upon your Worship However you must not expect Absolution before you have done Penance which is to come and Dine with us to Day and stay as long as we shall think fit Your Compliance shall bespeak some Favour from  Your enraged Judges MINOS RHADAMANTHUS  and  AEACUS  A very merry free Epistle indeed Sir said I 'Tis the Style said my Uncle we use in Writing to one another and if any other Form shou'd pass between us we shou'd fansy each other offended at something But come Youth continu'd my Uncle you must smug up yourself and go along with me for this is the Place I intend to bring you acquainted in for now they have honour'd me with the Title of Knight of the Shire I am now and then oblig'd to be with some BottleCompanions which will not altogether agree with your Age or Constitution so that I hope you will like the Company I shall provide for you and tho' the One is the Mother and the Other Aunt to the young Creature I was speaking of yet they are neither of 'em Forty the one is a Widow and  the other an old Maid if we may call her one at Eight and Thirty but she has nothing of the Stiffness or Formality of that State but is as easy and goodhumour'd as if she had lost that weighty Burden a  Maidenhead  twenty Year ago and what is more surprising resolves to die a Maid except some brawny Rascal does her the Favour to ravish her The Widow and Mother to the young Lady has been in the State of Widowhood near Fourteen Year for her Daughter was Posthumousborn yet tho' she is Mistress of a vast Fortune and consequently been sought by many in Marriage for Money is the Loadstone that draws all the World yet she resolves never to change her State These Three with their Family live as contentedly as any Three in the Universe 'Tis here I go when I have a mind to be innocently merry without bringing any Scandal to the Family because I am an old Fellow They have fitted up an Apartment for me in particular and I very often stay all Night Sir said I I suppose the Reason why the Widow does not marry again is the Love she bears to the Memory of her former Husband Rather I believe the Vexation she receiv'd from him reply'd my Uncle hinders  her for I have heard her often say he us'd to lead her a damn'd sort of Life and his Behaviour to her has confirm'd the Sister in the same Mind She often declares to me in her Thoughts the best of Husbands are but Plagues which I return by imagining the same thing by the Wives so we strengthen each other's Opinion by our Conversation which is something odd you'll say  But I forget continu'd my Uncle that I am talking to a SchoolBoy all this time Sir I return'd whatever you say to me shall do me no Injury but rather improve my Understanding Things of Moment I shall justly weigh and what is not necessary to be remember'd shall be forgot My Uncle made me many Compliments of my forward Sense but at the Tag of all to qualify 'em told me  Ripe Fruit was soon rotten  and so we both went to equip ourselves for our short Journey  In the Coach my Uncle told me I should do well to ingratiate myself with the Family for if I was ever to enter into the Matrimonial State I cou'd not do better for myself for added he tho' Marriage is a very bitter Pill yet there's Gold enough to gild it over and a handsome young Lady toboot  I told him whenever that Time came I shou'd value his Advice at the highest Rate Come come reply'd the old Gentleman I don't love Compliments they savour of Insincerity I return'd my Tongue and Heart ever did and I hop'd ever wou'd go together and whatever I said it shou'd be Truth Ay but Boy answer'd the old Gentleman you know the old Saying  Truth is not to be spoke at all Times  many a poor Man has suffer'd for speaking Truth  When we came to the End of our short Journey the two Sisters who were both comely Women came to the Gate to bid us welcome the young Lady they gave us to understand was walking in the Garden When we were brought into the Parlour after the usual Civilities my Uncle told 'em he had brought along with him a Person that he design'd one of their Acquaintance and if they balk'd his Intention he threaten'd 'em severely with his Indignation The Ladies reply'd I shou'd be welcome upon my own Account without his Recommendation Well well reply'd my Uncle I don't care how it's done so it is done But hold cry'd the Aunt won't it be something dangerous to allow him the Conversation and Acquaintance  of  Isabella  meaning the young Lady he'll perhaps in time wipe away from her Memory the good Advice against Matrimony we have taken much Time and Labour to inculcate  Fear not that reply'd my Uncle for I have and shall take as much Pains with the Youth that they may be on a Footing Upon this the young Lady came in to whose Acquaintance I was introduc'd Tho' she was the handsomest Creature my Eyes e'er beheld the Charms of her Person were equall'd by those of her Understanding and I soon found young as I was Love had taken full Possession of my Heart  The Conversation of the Day was chiefly compos'd of Mirth and laughing at former Transactions which were larded every now and then with Contempt upon the connubial State and I was almost ready to die with Despair to hear the fair  Isabella  join with 'em with more than ordinary Malice and Satyr  My Uncle desir'd she wou'd not be so inveterate for she was taking the only Method for him to fall directly in Love with her And that's the only way reply'd the Sister to get rid of your troublesome Company I  told the Lady I hop'd my Uncle wou'd not prove troublesome 'till such a Declaration I believe not young Gentleman reply'd the Lady but I fear there's much more Danger from your Worship than your Uncle your Years will bring you forward but his will make him lag behind I told her I shou'd always endeavour to keep myself in the good Graces of that Family and that nothing but Destiny shou'd make me forfeit it  Oh then return'd the Lady if it ever comes to that the Fault must be laid on  Destiny Fate Ill Stars  and I know not what I tell you continu'd the Sister smiling if your Years did not plead for you I shou'd begin to think you guilty I must own tho' this was but Rallying I cou'd not help blushing at what she said as knowing myself a Criminal already  Bedtime broke up our Company and every one retir'd to their several Apartments When I was alone Reflexion began to make me very uneasy The blind God had wounded me tho' not so deep as if I had more Years over my Head yet enough to break my Rest and trouble and confuse my young Imagination I got up at the Dawn of Day as uneasy as I went to Bed and walk'd in the  Garden alone for none of the Family were stirring All my Thoughts were busied on the fair Object of my Wishes I continu'd in my uneasy Contemplation several Hours  The first that interrupted my Meditations was the Charmer of my Heart who came to me with a smiling Countenance I am inform'd Sir said she you were early up this Morning I fear you did not like your Lodging There's nothing in this House I reply'd but what I have the utmost Regard for but I continu'd it was my usual Custom of rising early to my Studies We fell insensibly into the Affairs of the Family for I had not Courage once to mention what I felt within my Breast neither did I imagine she cou'd have a right Conception of what my Inclination wou'd have declar'd to her Among other things I told her we shou'd have the World unpeopled if every body was of her Mother Aunt and my Uncle's Mind She reply'd there was no Danger of that for the Men wou'd find Means to have Heirs to their Estates without troubling the Parson  I was a little confus'd at her Answer for I imagin'd she insinuated I was design'd my Uncle's Heir and therefore cou'd hardly  make her an Answer for my Uncle told me when he mention'd making his Will that I was the first that knew his Inclination and gave me a particular Charge to keep it a Secret from every one till he himself divulg'd it It was some time before I cou'd recover my Confusion for I was not assur'd they might not hint something of it to my Uncle and do me a Prejudice with him not as to the Estate for I little regarded my Interest but fearing I was not capable of keeping a Secret even of the utmost Consequence  The young Lady finding she had created some Confusion in my Thoughts began to comfort me with telling me my Uncle's Mind might alter and tho he was stiff in his Opinion concerning Matrimony did not doubt but his Eyes wou'd be open enough to see Merit where it was so conspicuous Her endeavouring to bring me out of Confusion plung'd me farther into it and sometimes I was thinking she was uttering Riddles and I knew not how to answer upon the Topic But at last I told her Whatever my Uncle shou'd think fit to do concerning his worldly Affairs shou'd never trouble me while he continu'd to do things correspondent with  Honour and Honesty I am very glad to hear it reply'd the young Lady and I fansy young Gentlemen like you who study much acquire Understanding Fortitude and Resolution and all other Manly Virtues before their Years write 'em Men Madam I reply'd in some it might be so but I had made no Progress in any of 'em but one and that I fear'd will be rather counted a Weakness  I fansy then return'd the Lady since you own it a Frailty you will make me your Confessor and if I judge it to be as you call it a Weakness I'll tell you what Penance you shall undergo for Pardon Madam I reply'd you are the only Person in the World that I will confess to but then you must promise me like a true Confessor to keep it for ever a Secret from all the World whether it displeases you or not tho' I am under dismal Apprehensions of losing your Favour more dear to me than all the World  Heyday reply'd  Isabella  if we were not both too young I shou'd imagine you were going to make Love to me Madam I answer'd you have guess'd the very Secret of my Heart The tender Thoughts my Breast  contains are all for you Don't think it a Boyish Passion apt to change for whatever Usage I meet with from you I must continue to adore you I have weigh'd our Years yours and your Family's Aversion to Matrimony by your Yesterday's Discourse and no Consideration can put a Stop to my Passion All the Favour I ask or desire is only Leave silently to adore you and if you find your Heart averse to my constant Wishes let me beg you to grant me Pity for all that I shall suffer and I shall rejoice at every Pang I feel because they are for you I am convinc'd your Understanding far exceeds your Years therefore I intreat you to think beyou speak and consider this 'tis in your Power alone to make me live or die I own our Fortunes are at present unequal but Time may produce many things inspir'd by you I wou'd aim at every thing that is honourable to deserve you that Way nor shou'd I doubt succeeding I said every thing my Tongue cou'd utter prompted by Love and had this Satisfaction to observe her Face was not dress'd in Frowns After many rallying Speeches finding me continue in my Distress  Well said she as I promis'd to be your Confessor I'll keep it a Secret as we agreed on and perhaps if I thought you in earnest I shou'd think of some Punishment equal to what your Crime deserves But you have been reading  Ovid  lately I suppose and you wou'd be endeavouring to put some of his Rules in practice upon me It is a pleasing Satisfaction to me I reply'd to hear you understand  Ovid  so well and by your Choice I hope you will remember all his Rules What return'd the young Lady because I have read that Author as our  English  Translators have given him to us for I own I am not so happy to understand the Original wou'd you interpret for me that I like the Subject No continu'd  Isabella  I have read  Reynolds  on Murder and yet I hope you will believe I abhor the Facts related there I hope fo too Madam I reply'd therefore you will consider that what my Tongue utter'd was from the very Bottom of my Soul and if you will not receive my Declaration favourably you will be the Death of me which will make you a passive Murderer  Few People I believe die for Love in this Age reply'd  Isabella  however our  Years will protect both of us I told her the Tree that took deepest Root stood the longest Yes returned  Isabella  and the Impressions cut in young Barks soonest wear out and often kill the Tree Madam said I Well well cry'd  Isabella  we have had enough on this Subject for once Madam said I does the Word  Once  imply you wou'd pardon me whenever Fortune will give me another Opportunity of declaring my Passion I have not Time now to answer you said  Isabella  for I perceive your Uncle my Mother and Aunt are coming towards us But I thought her Words were accompanied with so sweet a Look that bid me hope and Hope is all the Pleasure of our Lives  When we had join'd Company we were the Theme of the old Folks Raillery for some time Hark you young Man said my Uncle how came you to rise so early this Morning Only because I do it every Morning Sir said I to read Why Sirrah said my Uncle if I had thought you had brought a Book along with you here I wou'd have taken it from you and burnt it Is not here Contemplation enough for you pointing to the Ladies Yes Sir reply'd the Mother I think he does well to have something to entertain  his Thoughts alone for I don't much relish the young Ones getting together so early I don't well know how they cou'd entertain themselves without talking of Love Why if we shou'd reply'd  Isabella  'twou'd be only to fortify each other against that Passion Well well said the Aunt your Ages secure you at present but I shou'd be loth to trust you five or six Years hence Ay but said my Uncle  Will  studies the Mathematics and he knows every thing of  Geography  and  Navigation  already but just going to Sea and can tell you in what Latitude the  Cape of Good Hope  lies under tho' he was never there he has all the  Theory  and only wants the  Practice    None of your Allegories reply'd the Mother I have a very good Opinion of the young Gentleman therefore hold your Tongue for what you can say for him will only lessen it Come come the Tea stays for us said the Aunt I'm glad on't cry'd my Uncle for now we shall have a little Scandal Tea has no Relish without it  My Uncle having no Business at home we continu'd in this agreeable Company three whole Days and tho' we were to receive a Visit from them in two more yet the Separation  from that I held most dear on Earth was very irksome to me but the Hope of seeing her so soon mitigated my Grief  When we came home to my Uncle's I observ'd a Youth walking in the Garden very near my own Age as I cou'd guess at the Distance I saw him for as soon as he perceiv'd me he walk'd another way as not being willing I shou'd see him I ask'd one of the Servants that happen'd to be in the Garden who that Youth was I just before saw at the Fountain He reply'd it was the Housekeeper's Son What is the Housekeeper marry'd then said I Not now reply'd the Servant and smil'd Observing the Humour of the Man by his Countenance I ask'd him many Questions concerning the Housekeeper and her Child but could not learn who was the Father positively yet he gave me Hints enough to imagine my Uncle had some Interest in the Affair which created in me a great deal of Uneasiness for it soon occurr'd to my Memory what the divine  Isabella  told me in her Mother's Garden  that Heirs to Estates might be procur'd without the Help of the Parson  My Uneasiness did not proceed from any Disappointment relating to the Estate any farther  than I thought it might have reconcil'd me to  Isabella  's Family for I imagin'd if ever I cou'd move her Heart to love me she wou'd as much despise Riches as myself for even young as I was I cou'd have been contented to have got my Subsistence from my daily Labour if  Isabella  wou'd have submitted to have shar'd my Fortune for I never once thought of hers but I wish'd it much less or rather none at all that I might have been more on the Equality  While I was musing on the State of my Love I was interrupted by my Uncle's Housekeeper who with a familiar Air inquir'd concerning our Entertainment at the Widow's I found by her Discourse the poor Creature was jealous of my Uncle and to increase her Opinion I told her I fansy'd we shou'd shortly have a Wedding for it look'd very like it Between whom ask'd the Housekeeper hastily why between my Uncle and the Widow I answer'd I observ'd her Countenance change at what I said and a very great Disorder appear'd about her But I did not think fit to have any further Conversation with her so left her to her own disorder'd Thoughts  When my Uncle and I were together he ask'd me how I lik'd the young Lady for he had not an Opportunity to ask me in the Coach as we came home because we brought a neighbouring Gentleman home with us that came to make a Visit at the Widow's I told him I had a very great Regard for her and I did not doubt but my Years wou'd increase it I wou'd advise you said my Uncle to make your Addresses there but secretly for I am convinc'd you won't meet with a more beneficial Match I answer'd my Uncle I was of his Opinion tho' not from the Greatness of her Fortune but from the Charms of her Person and Understanding Why I wou'd have you affect what you marry but I hope you don't imagine young Man said my Uncle a good Fortune will be any Hindrance Not in the least Sir said I but I wou'd have no Two join in that holy Ceremony if they cou'd not despise Fortune Well well reply'd my Uncle Experience will tell you another Tale when you have a few Years more over your Head which is now fill'd with Notions of Honour and I know not how many chimerical Ideas that have their Being in thy Brain You read too much  I hope Sir said I Reading is design'd to cultivate the Understanding and raise our Imaginations above the Vulgar I am of the Opinion a Man of Quality with a  Plebeian  Soul is a  Plebeian  and on the contrary a  Plebeian  with exalted Merit ought to change Fortunes with him But you forget with all your Learning and Philosophy that Fortune's blind young Man reply'd my Uncle and distributes her Favours as blindly I have seen Dullness and Stupidity in a Coach and Six while Virtue Merit and a whole Library of Learning walk on Foot The more Shame to the degenerate Age you'll say young Man True Sir said I and if I had a Fortune answerable to my Inclination I wou'd never see one of those you mention'd last twice in the same Condition  Don't think reply'd my Uncle that I am endeavouring to blot out those Notions of Virtue that I see wrote in thy Soul for it is on the Consideration of thy noble Inclinations that I have lately resolv'd in my Will to leave thee a considerable Fortune being assur'd thou wilt make the right Use of it The Bulk of my Estate was left me by an Uncle an old Batchelor as I am which I intend to leave to thee in the same manner  Neither can I think thy good Understanding Boy continu'd my Uncle will receive any Prejudice from our Contempt of the Marriage State tho' the Reason why I have not chang'd my Condition is that the first Object of my Wishes was by Fate deny'd me But I suppose you have heard your Father often repeat the Story Never in my Life I reply'd for I have been at School ever since Five Years old and very seldom convers'd with any of the Family and I may justly say Sir that I am almost as great a Stranger in the Knowledge of my Ancestors as one that never heard of us Well then said my Uncle I'll let you into as much as I know of 'em  We are originally  Welch  Many of our Ancestors have flourish'd in the Church as well as State and left a sweet Scent of Virtue in their Ashes I was the youngest of three the eldest dying in the Wars when he had gain'd many everliving Laurels Your Father prov'd Heir to the Estate who is one Year elder than myself My Father's Brother having acquir'd a great Estate by Merchandize in the  Indies  and having an Inclination for me always declar'd me his Heir and I liv'd with him as such therefore  I think it almost your Due to be Heir to mine About the Age of Seventeen I fell in Love with a young Lady of a very small Fortune but that was supply'd by the Charms of her Mind and Person Her Mother for her Father had been dead many Years was averse to my Passion She wou'd often tell her Daughter I was but a younger Brother and tho' every Body imagin'd I was to be Heir to my Uncle yet no body was assur'd of it Old Men were as subject to change their Minds as young ones therefore she wou'd by no means consent to my Courtship but when she found I continu'd my Addresses she secretly inform'd my Uncle who took me to task on the other side with many Arguments prov'd I shou'd be much to blame to think of a Woman of such a narrow Fortune when in Prospect I was Master of such a large one and hinted to me if I continu'd in my Folly as he call'd it I might be balk'd of my Expectation  Tho' my Love was as great as cou'd be yet I thought it was but common Prudence to dissemble and I told my Uncle I hop'd I shou'd never give him any Occasion to forfeit the good Opinion he had already conceiv'd  of me He gave me very good Advice which I promis'd to follow But every thing must submit to Love Fortune Interest Relations and Friendship must give way to that soft Passion And I doubt not young Man notwithstanding your Learning and pretended Fortitude but Time will convince you of what I say I sigh'd and was in some Confusion at my Uncle's Discourse but made him no Answer because I wou'd not interrupt him  By secret Interviews continu'd my Uncle I gain'd the Heart of the young Lady unbiass'd by her Interest for in the mean time she was courted by a Gentleman possess'd of a Fortune much beyond the Hopes of her Family who soon gain'd the Mother's Consent and being an obstinate Woman she promis'd him her Daughter's In the mean time we met almost every Night by the Help of the Maid who by Bribes and Promises was in my Interest and one Evening among the rest I took Possession of the willing Fair One  Our Amours were not so secret as we imagin'd for my Rival being inform'd of our Correspondence tho' he had no Notion how far our Intimacy was carry'd sent me a Challenge  which I accepted of tho' unwillingly for I am of that Opinion Men's Honour often prompts 'em on to those Acts their Consciences and Wills wou'd leave undone We met and Fortune declar'd in my Favour by dangerously wounding my Adversary without my receiving the least Hurt The Mother to the Fair One was exasperated to the last Degree and in the Heat of her blind Rage took her Daughter along with her to visit her intended Soninlaw where she agreed notwithstanding his Wounds and her Daughter's Cries and Lamentations to marry 'em immediately which was perform'd  You may guess what we both felt at this Shock of Fate for Possession had heighten'd my Passion I tore and rav'd like a Madman and was almost inconsolable and nothing but the Regard I ow'd my Uncle kept me from doing some rash Act But Time that cures most Sorrows gave me some Consolation as imagining I shou'd have still a Correspondence with the disconsolate Fair One for her continu'd Sorrow convinc'd me she mourn'd for the same Cause  I took an Opportunity and got a Letter convey'd to her but what was my Surprize and Sorrow at her Answer I have read it  so often and 'tis so well imprinted in my Memory that I can repeat it  verbatim    SIR  THO' I love you more than Life which I am convinc'd I shall not long keep yet the Duty I owe my Husband shall prevent any future Interviews Strive to forget me as I willingly wou'd you tho' impossible and never more think there ever was such a Wretch as the unfortunate  MARIA  I strove many ways to come to a better Understanding but she as carefully avoided it I linger'd out many Days in this Interval of Life if I may call it so for I cou'd not say I was alive One Morning her Maid brought me a Letter and tho' I offer'd her Gold to stay the Reading of it yet she wou'd not The Contents of this last were as surprising as the first  MY DEAR  I  AM now going I firmly believe into another World to answer for my Miscarriages in this for I find the Pangs of ChildBirth upon me which I hope and am almost assur'd  I shall not outlive It is the Fruit of our guilty Joys Let me conjure you if the Infant shou'd survive find some means to prove a Father for it can not expect any other in this World and cherish the Memory of your unfortunate  MARIA  I was so far plung'd in Grief at the Knowledge of her State that I went into the Fields to have more Freedom for Contemplation and tho' it was Morning when I receiv'd the Letter I had not thought of returning if the Curtain of the Night had not began to spread the Hemisphere but ere I cou'd get out of the Fields I heard somebody walk very fast behind me and turning about I was somewhat surpriz'd to see the Husband of  Maria  with his Sword drawn in his Hand as ready to attack me Tho' I was weary of Life I had no Thought of rendering it to one I had no very kind Thoughts for Yet I was resolv'd to parly with him and do my Endeavour to bring him to Temper for I consider'd he had Matter enough to gall him But Words signify'd nothing and he press'd so violently upon me that I was oblig'd to oppose him  and in a little time left him dead upon the Ground  I immediately got home to my Uncle's who waited for me and was going to chide me but seeing me look so pale and confus'd and without my Sword for in the last Thrust that gave him his Death he fell down towards me and I let it fall out of my Hand and his Body fell upon't he very tenderly ask'd me the Cause of my Concern When I had inform'd him Well said my Uncle be not so troubled since you have kill'd him fairly I'll warrant thy Pardon But were there any Witnesses of the Action Several said I on the other side of the River tho' I know not who they were I was in so much Confusion However he deserv'd Death said my Uncle for killing the unfortunate  Maria  and her innocent Infant I did not hear what more my Uncle said for the Use of my Senses was taken from me and I fell into a Swoon yet when I recover'd I found myself in Bed for my Uncle imagining I had receiv'd some Wound in the Encounter order'd a Surgeon to be brought but when he was inform'd of the Truth he was convinc'd that 'twas pure Grief that had overcome me and almost  compell'd me to be let Blood I was in such a Condition that Despair had got the Ascendant over me and had resolv'd with myself not to live And in order to put my Design in Execution being inform'd my Uncle was gone out upon some urgent Affairs I order'd my Man to go to another Surgeon of my Acquaintance and bring him along with him which was quickly done I then took an Occasion to send my Servant out of the way and desir'd the Surgeon to let me Blood in the other Arm which he comply'd with not knowing I had been let Blood before  As soon as he was gone I undid both the Bandages the Blood pour'd out of my Veins and I soon became insensible Heaven forgive me for I now declare I had no other Thought but following my dear Mistress whom it was plain I lov'd more than Life which that Day wou'd have put an End to if it had not been purely for an Accident for the last Surgeon meeting with him that first bled me among other Discourse told him he was going to see how I did after my Bleeding by the Order of my Uncle who was oblig'd to go out and that he was to stay with me till his Return  The last Surgeon in a sort of Surprize told him he had not been long come from me and had let me Blood and soon finding there must be some extraordinary Meaning in my Proceeding came both together and broke open the Door that I had lock'd before I let loose my Arms I was so far gone that they gave my Uncle no Hopes of Life which I was inform'd almost put him into my Condition 'Twas two whole Days ere I open'd my Eyes and three more before I recover'd my Understanding and the Thoughts of the Catastrophe of my dear  Maria  had made me resolve to take nothing to support Life if I had not been prevail'd upon by my Uncle whose Sorrow quite confounded me and a religious Man who set before me the heinous Sin of SelfMurder a Sin he told me cou'd never be pardon'd for it was directly flying in the Face of Heaven without a Possibility of repenting the Action  The Thoughts of Eternity made me repent of the Act and resolve to live By degrees I recover'd my former Strength and meeting one Day with  Maria  's Maid by Accident I desir'd she wou'd give me some Account of the melancholy Action  Sir said she when my poor Mistress felt the Pangs and Throes of Labour upon her she wrote that Letter and order'd me to return upon the Instant I had deliver'd it for she shou'd want me in her unhappy Condition When I came back I found her Pains grew worse When I found how it was I told her I wou'd go and send for the Midwife Do then said she for tho' I wish for Death the poor Innocent has done nothing to deserve it That may live to meet with a better Fate than its unhappy Mother and in her utmost Pangs she softly utter'd your Name The Midwife came and she was deliver'd after great Agonies of a fine Girl whose early Features promis'd to exceed her Mother's Beauty  Maria  's Mother and the rest of her Relations were in the utmost Confusion at what they saw for seeing it a beautiful fullgrown Child they were well convinc'd the Husband was not the Father of it The Mother came up to her and notwithstanding her weak Condition gave her all the ill Language she cou'd think of The poor Lady at last faintly told her it was her own Fault to force her to that Marriage That she was join'd to you by Heaven And she believ'd  she had no Guilt to answer for what she had done for she had ever liv'd with her Husband virtuously and ceas'd all Correspondence with you since the Day of her unfortunate Marriage which I witness'd for her in the Letter she had wrote to you She was brought to Bed pretty early in the Morning Her Husband was gone to Hunt with some Gentlemen of the Country But when he return'd he soon came to the Truth of every thing for there was no concealing how Matters went  Is is so  cry'd he all enrag'd  And am I an antedated Cuckold I'll have no Man say I keep a Whore or Bastard of his  Therefore upon the Instant he flew to the Bed first ran his Sword into the unfortunate  Maria  's Breast and snatching the lovely Infant from the Nurse's Arms threw it against the Ground and dash'd out its innocent Brains  It was some time before either of us cou'd proceed in the sad Narration for Tears at the unhappy Act When the Maid had a little recover'd herself she proceeded  The Wound the barbarous Wretch gave the unfortunate  Maria  did not immediately rob her of Life but she liv'd to make all the Hearers weep at what she related  even her unkind Mother cou'd not refrain Tears wishing a thousand times she had dy'd before she had forc'd her to that unlucky Match Dear Mother reply'd the fainting Fair One do not repine but learn to forget Me and this unhappy Day Consider Fate is in every thing I beg yours and Heaven's Forgiveness And then began to faint She wou'd see the Infant tho' in that piteous Condition After looking upon it for some time Poor Babe said she thou hast severely paid tho' Innocent for the Crime of thy Father and Mother which I hope is forgiven by Heaven Here she began to faint again and only said  Heaven forgive me preserve and support my Dear  Here her Tongue fail'd she only gave a Groan and expir'd We all suppos'd it was your Name she wou'd have utter'd but Death stept between  This Relation had almost brought me to my former Despair and I often wish'd the Wretch alive once more that had been the Cause of poor  Maria  's Death that I might have kill'd him again  'Twas several Years before I cou'd wipe away the Thoughts of my dear  Maria  Nay I can never forget her nor seldom remember  her without bringing Tears into my Eyes as I have at this Repetition of my former Sorrow for indeed we both cou'd not refrain from weeping but for her sake only I am resolv'd to live and die a Batchelor which said he reassuming some of his former Gaiety is the better for you Tho' my Uncle often told me added the old Gentleman if he had known my Passion had been so strong and sincere he wou'd not have been against our Marriage Since I have assum'd a freer Air and having got acquainted in this Family rail along with 'em they having known nothing of my Story for it did not make any great Noise because my Uncle procur'd Witnesses enough that heard our Discourse and the barbarous Act spoke so much that I was never try'd for it which was in some sort too prevented by my Illness and weak Condition  This Story of my Uncle's seem'd to me an Introductory History to my Misfortunes which caus'd me much sorrowful Thinking yet I had ever some secret Hoping that kept up my sinking Spirits When we went to Dinner Madam the Housekeeper look'd very glum upon my Uncle tho' she continu'd her Civility to me yet I took but little  Notice of it After Dinner I went to Fish in a River at the bottom of the Garden and in an Hour's time my Uncle came to me  Hark you young Man said he I have a Crow to pluck with you What is the Reason good young Spark that you have disturb'd my Housekeeper with a Story of a Cock and a Bull about Marriage and I know not what with I know not who Why really Sir said I she examin'd me so strictly this Morning that I hope you will pardon me if I tell you I thought her impertinent neither did I imagine she had any Right to be angry or pleas'd at what I said tho' I must own I saw it disorder'd her but I suppose that only proceeded from her Interest for if she imagin'd you marry'd you wou'd have no Occasion for a Housekeeper for added I smiling my Lady wou'd take that Work off her Hands Well young Spark said my Uncle I find you are a prying young Gentleman and since you resolve to know all my Secrets I'll declare another to you This Woman is now and then pleas'd to Tuck me up and moreover has laid a Child to me but the Boy is so unlike the reputed Father I have no Notion I had any  Hand in the forming him Now this makes her assume an Authority And to let you know further 'tis the very Maid that liv'd with the unfortunate  Maria  I thought it was my Duty to do something for her and at my Uncle's Death I took her into the House The Freedom I gave her in talking now and then of that melancholy Adventure grew at last into an Intimacy Flesh and Blood being frail and different Sexes at all Hours of opportunity together will show themselves  Sir said I what you have entrusted me with shall only teach me to pay her more Respect than I have done without letting her know I am let into the Secret And for the future I shall not tell her any thing that will perplex her upon your Account Nay said my Uncle smiling I shall ever make her know the Difference between the Handmaid and the Master And whether her Child be mine or not whenever I die I shall provide handsome enough for 'em both tho' perhaps not according to her Expectation The Boy is ignorant who his Father is pursuant to my Instruction to the Mother and I am apt to believe she has kept it a Secret for he is not yet of Age to be  trusted with it tho' the Lad is forward enough in every thing but just Learning which makes me the more suspect I am none of his Father  Our Conversation has lasted for Six and Twenty Years and in Fifteen of my juvenile Years she never pretended to make me a Father I know she has fed herself with vain Hopes I wou'd make a Will and put him down for Heir But I can assure you it never was my Intention nor ever will be and I shall leave 'em the less for Impertinence Whatever you please Sir said I but don't leave 'em the less upon my Account Well a few Days answer'd my Uncle will put an End to their Hopes or Fears and tho' when an Heir is settled to an Estate he looks like a Coffin to some People yet Youth I don't know how to part with you to the University I am convinc'd you will have little to learn but ill Customs which many Scholars imbibe where they shou'd avoid 'em But I am not at all in pain for you I believe the Tenets of Virtue sufficiently stampt in your Mind Therefore I have some Thoughts of riding over to your Father to prevail upon him to let you and your Tutor live with me I'll take care you  shan't want Books I have a good Library of my own and if that won't do let me but know your Wants and they shall be supply'd I gave him Thanks suitable to so agreeable an Offer but hinted to him a Person is not so well esteem'd in the World without a UniversityEducation That's but a small Consideration reply'd my Uncle and if we meet with no other Difficulties I hope we shall get over that  From this Subject we proceeded to that of the Widow's Family I believe Sir said I  Isabella  is and will be as averse to Marriage at least by her Discourse as her Mother or Aunt I fansy young Man reply'd my Uncle you begin to fear it Come come continue your Correspondence there's a great deal in the first Impression and Nature will prevail But enough of this I'll now shew you my Library which you have not yet seen and give you the Key that you may make use of it when you please but added he if you use it too much I'll take it from you again  When we came into the Library which was a spacious Room built on purpose I was surpriz'd to find it so well stor'd with such Variety and valuable Books especially  all the Classics of the best Editions I told my Uncle I lik'd my Situation so well that if he wou'd give me Leave I wou'd employ myself a few Hours to look 'em over That was one Reason why I brought you here now reply'd my Uncle for I am oblig'd to go for some Hours upon some urgent Affairs and imagining I shou'd bring you into Company you wou'd like made me the more willing to introduce you to 'em and if you find yourself tir'd and their Conversation shou'd not please you they won't be disoblig'd at your leaving 'em So saying he gave me the Key and shut me in While I was in high Delight for I had even forgot the fair  Isabella  I heard Whispering in the next Closet which made me awake from my pleasing Amusement and in a little time I cou'd hear the good Housekeeper say You may speak louder for I am assur'd there's no one within hearing for the old Gentleman's gone out Ay but reply'd the Man's Voice What's become of the young One Gone with him to be sure return'd the Housekeeper for he does not stir a Foot without him and therefore let us make good Use of our Time for I fear our Meetings will be less frequent I am convinc'd this young  Gentleman will be a Thorn in our Side for when he and his Uncle were together the Day that he came I heard him inform him that he wou'd make his Will shortly and put him down his Heir Now as you no doubt are to draw the Writings I wou'd have you find some Means to provide for our Child which he imagines to be his That I think will be impossible answer'd the Man for be assur'd he will read it over before he Signs it or if he does not do it then he may at some other Time No no that will never do We must e'en wait with Patience till his Death and I'll find it easy enough to make a Will for our Advantage of a later Date than what he intends to make I own said the Housekeeper it goes against me to think of defrauding the young Gentleman But when you consider reply'd the Man you do it for your own Flesh and Blood you ought to have no Scruple Well return'd the Housekeeper I must leave the whole Affair to you I shou'd be contented to share the Estate between the two Boys and I think if he does otherwise as he imagines our Child his he will not do Justice We shall see what he intends to do when he makes his Will reply'd the Man and in  short till then we can't make a Judgment on any one thing  I found afterwards they had left speaking aloud and were making themselves as merry as they cou'd They were so boisterous that several Folios I had lean'd against the Wainscot tumbled down which alarm'd 'em very much Bless me cry'd  Forsooth  What's that I can't tell return'd the Man I hope the Squire is not in his Study No that I am sure of said the Housekeeper Now I recollect myself continu'd she 'tis some of the Books tumbled off the Shelves They made themselves easy with that Supposition and continu'd their Game After some time I cou'd hear 'em go softly down Stairs I waited at the Window some time and at last saw him go thro' the Courtyard He was a tall thin Man had a Cast of an Eye and seem'd about Forty  As soon as I found all was still I went softly out of the Library and went into my own Room a pair of Stairs higher to avoid all Suspicion When I was there I resolv'd to acquaint my Uncle with the whole Truth for I thought it wou'd be Injustice to conceal it if it had not concern'd myself When my Uncle came in he was in a very good  Humour and wou'd often smile at his own Imagination I told him it was a great Pity he shou'd stay at home as he usually did if going abroad made him so merry  Billy  reply'd my Uncle I have so much Reason to be merry at least in my own Opinion that I'll tell you the Cause of my Mirth and I have so good a Regard for your Understanding that I'll rule my Risibility for this once by it and if you declare I am in the wrong to be merry I'll do my Endeavour to be otherwise  Sir said I if that is the only Reason in letting me into the Secret of your Mirth you need not give yourself that Trouble for I am apt to believe you will be right in every thing you do No Compliments Boy reply'd my Uncle I have told you before I don't like 'em But to proceed  You remember that Gentleman we brought in the Coach from the Widow's yesterday That Gentleman is about Five and Thirty Three Years ago he was one of the most eminent Merchants upon the  Exchange  and his Credit wou'd have stretch'd as far as the best of 'em  In the Time of his Prosperity he fell in Love with a WidowLady of a vast Fortune  without the Incumbrances of Children upon't The Lady gave him all the Encouragement he cou'd expect The Day of their Espousals was fix'd and near approaching when the uncomfortable News was brought him of the Loss of almost all his Fortune for three of his richest Vessels were taken by Pirates This as you may suppose was a very great Shock to him but being a Person of the utmost Philosophy he calmly resign'd himself to the Will of Heaven He immediately left off Trade and when his Debts were paid he that was but ten Days before in every Body's Opinion worth a Hundred Thousand Pounds found himself Master of Seventy Pounds a Year and his Country House which he instantly sold and as I thought it a good Bargain I became the Purchaser His greatest Satisfaction in his Misfortunes was the Thoughts of the Widow's proving constant to him and he did not doubt but with her Assistance to recover his Losses But few Women my Boy are sincere in their Protestations 'Tis true sometimes the blind Spark stings 'em in the Tail that they become as blind as Fortune or otherwise they are as hard to deal with as a Parson for his Tithes  The Gentleman after his Misfortunes I can with Justice declare was more welcome to me than before for it wou'd be a Hardship indeed to have the Unfortunate slighted and I am assur'd that generous Minds resent things that are offer'd 'em in their Adversity that they wou'd not have regarded in their Prosperity One Morning at Breakfast I observ'd him very melancholy insomuch that he refus'd his Chocolate I encourag'd him as much as I cou'd as imagining the Thoughts of his Losses had attack'd him But I was very much surpriz'd to hear him say his former Losses were nothing to what then oppress'd him I must own said he I had some Omens of it Yesterday for when I went to visit the Widow as usual I was told she was not at home but returning by the GardenWall I heard her talking to her Maid and when I call'd to her cou'd get no Answer This Morning my Suspicions are confirm'd for she has just now sent me a Letter where she tells me  She is very much grieved at my Losses and as Merchandizing is so very precarious she hopes I will pardon her if she intends to keep her Fortune to herself and endeavour to mend my Credit with somebody else  The Loss of her Money  does not vex me half so much as her insulting me and tho' I must own I have a very great Regard for her Person yet I wou'd not wed her now if she shou'd repent of her Usage  I believe there's little Danger of that said I Women have Obstinacy enough to keep bad Resolutions All I cou'd say to him gave him but little Comfort and I must confess his Uneasiness infected me But as I have told you Time is an excellent Doctor for the almost bald Gentleman wrought a Cure so that he often wish'd it in his Power to be reveng'd on the Widow  Many Weeks pass'd on and his Inclination strengthen'd tho' no Accident cou'd assist him till about two Months ago an old Barn that belong'd to the House I order'd to be pull'd down with an Intention to make an Addition to my Garden for I had some Overtures made me by a Nobleman concerning a Purchase in which I shou'd make a considerable Profit tho' with a secret Intention to give it to the Gentleman I had bought it of The Barn in reality did still belong to him for it serv'd a Farm near the House I had bought which was the Remainder of the Gentleman's Estate and the same he liv'd in  In digging the Earth of the Foundation there was found a Pot of Money that contain'd upwards of a Hundred Pound which was given the Gentleman As we were at Supper and pretty merry at the Accident an odd Thought came into my Head Why may we not said I to the Gentleman report we have found a larger Sum No one knows what we have found but the Man that dug it up and we can instruct him to favour the Deceit But to what End return'd the Gentleman Why to be reveng'd on the Widow said I I am assur'd 'twas covetous Interest at first made her comply with your Addresses and when once she finds it her Interest she'll receive 'em willingly again and if we can bring Matters about to compleat your Revenge you must e'en marry her The Gentleman smil'd at my Project but thought it wou'd be impossible to bring it to any thing Well said I you shall have little to do I warrant I'll make your Part easy enough Accordingly I went to work We reported about the Country that such a Gentleman had found a vast Treasure in his Barn suppos'd to be hid there in the Civil Wars even enough to recompense all his Losses The Fellow that dug up the Money was an  arch Rogue one fit for our Design I took care to instruct him and to carry every thing on with a good Face as I wanted a Coach I bought a new one sent the Gentleman to his House again as if he had made a new Purchase of it in the new Coach and Attendance suitable I also let the Sister to  Isabella  's Mother into the Secret who by her Contrivance receiv'd the Addresses of the Gentleman You must imagine this surpriz'd every Body and soon came to the fickle Widow's Ear She it seems began to be very inquisitive had sent for the Fellow that dug the Money up and examin'd him He afterwards came and inform'd us what pass'd between 'em I was very much pleas'd to hear it and we instructed him how he shou'd behave to her We order'd him to let her know that we were to meet to settle our Matters at a neighbouring Tavern in the Town and several People along with the fortunate Squire  When the Fellow came back from her we took him into Examination again As soon as I came before her said the Fellow she ask'd me if I was the Man that had found the Money Yes Madam said I Well and is it as much as the World reports Really  I can't tell forsooth said I There was sixteen great Pots that wou'd hold about a Gallon apiece and in one of 'em there was abundance of such Stuff as your Ladyship has about your Neck forsooth and in your Ears I can't tell what they are good for not I but they say they are worth Twenty Thousand Pounds Well but said the Lady to him do you know what was in the Pots Why in nine Pots forsooth said I there was nothing but Pieces of old Gold and the rest had all Silver in 'em But I did say Sir I thought it was too good for you for you gave me but Ten Pounds in old  Jacobus's  for my Honesty for you know Madam said I I cou'd have secur'd a Pot or two for myself But when I told her you were to meet at the Tavern she gave me a Crown and said she wou'd give me another if I cou'd find means to bring her into the next Room to where you were I am to bring her Word tomorrow when you are all met and she'll be ready to come with me  Well what say you now said I to the Gentleman our Plot begins to thicken Why indeed he reply'd I begin to conceive some Hopes of it We gave the Fellow his Instructions and I told him I wou'd make  one of his Lyes a Truth if we succeeded and that shou'd be the Ten Pounds He gave us good Assurance that he wou'd not fail in his Part  The next Day we met at the Place appointed with Gentlemen that we had let into the Secret and among the rest one to represent a Lawyer for we did not much care to trust a real One there is so little Honesty among 'em The Fellow was to give Notice when the Widow was come by shutting a Casement in the Room where she was to be for it was an oldfashion'd Window and made Noise enough in the Shutting to be heard all over the House We at last heard the Signal to begin our Farce I had provided a great Number of old Writings and Papers that if she shou'd have the Curiosity to peep she might perceive we had all our Implements One of our Company told our Gentleman the most that cou'd be made of his Jewels was Eighteen Thousand Five Hundred Pounds Another cry'd There's your Bills for the Forty Thousand Pounds from the Goldsmiths And there's the Five Thousand Bank Notes but added he the Tellers were surpriz'd they had not seen so many Pieces of old Gold in their Lives neither  wou'd they accept 'em but by Weight It can't be help'd cry'd our Gentleman they will have a good Profit by it for I suppose it will all be paid out to the full Currency  Every body play'd their Parts to Admiration And when our Business was over we sat in to Drinking with many Healths to the Gentleman as Top of our Company We had not been at it long ere our Emissary came in who told us Madam had got Intelligence enough he believ'd for after we were set in to Drinking she presently retir'd first giving me a Guinea as a golden Key to lock up my Tongue which I promis'd her faithfully to perform and Masters you may perceive I intend to keep my Word We spent the rest of the Evening with good Wine tho' at a Tavern and the Hopes of succeeding in our Design  The next Morning we found it began to work for this Letter pulling one out of his Pocket came from the Widow to the Gentleman  SIR  I  AM surpriz'd I have neither seen or heard from you these three Months I expected an Answer from a Letter I sent you out of a Joke  to see how you wou'd resent a Refusal But that Passion is not very strong to be thrown down at a seeming Denial I have something to say to you which is not altogether so proper to commit to Writing but if you'll take the Trouble to come our Way I can inform you of a Person that wou'd be glad to see you  Yours to command c  Why now Friend said I she begins to nibble and it's your own Fault if you don't catch her I'll engage she takes the Bait if you'll be but careful in playing her Why what wou'd you have me to do said the Gentleman Do said I do as you shou'd do marry her for you can't be sufficiently reveng'd without it I can't do that he reply'd that will be too fullgrown a Cheat you must consider that Station lasts for Life and to have all my Hours imbitter'd with Upbraidings wou'd prove a Hell upon Earth Why said I the World will but laugh at the Trick I mean those that know it and for those that don't know the Artifice we have us'd they will have the better Regard for your Wife Besides when she finds the Imposition her Understanding will make her quiet for my Part I think it will be a fitting  Punishment Besides I am assur'd she must have some Inclination for you or she wou'd not have accepted your first Addresses but that her Avarice prov'd too weighty for her Love This ought to reconcile you to the Design If you have any Regard for her you'll soon find means to make all even and if you've none your Conscience will not long trouble you I'll assure you if I thought there was the least Guilt in't I wou'd not have any Hand in't Besides in the long Run she may not prove a Loser Fortune has fair Looks as well as Frowns and her Ill Humour may be worn out The Consideration of that said he has wip'd away all Scruples and I'll venture thro' all Dangers In short he made his Visit and in all his Discourse hinted that the Report of finding so much Wealth was false and told her the Truth in hopes not to be believ'd To cut my Story short he once more gain'd her Consent and this Evening they were marry'd Now this is the great Business I have been about What makes me smile is the Lady's mighty Inclination to live in the House where the Money was found imagining there were more Mines of Wealth to be work'd out yet Tomorrow I intend to visit  'em and let her know the whole Truth of the Matter which I did not care to do till after Consummation And now continu'd my Uncle I have let you into the Secret of my Mirth tho' it is impossible to inform you of all the merry Circumstances I wish said I Sir your Punishment is not too severe for the poor Woman I warrant you said my Uncle she'll soon forget her Resentment A Blessing you know  Billy  must always follow Wedlock I wish it may Sir said I  Our Discourse was interrupted by a loud Ringing at the Door We all ran to the Window to see who it was in such Haste and saw a Person at the Door with his Horse all in a Foam enquiring for Squire  Bridgford  which was the Name of the Gentleman who was marry'd that Evening The Wedding being a Secret my Uncle told him he would not be in Town till the Morning He seem'd very uneasy which my Uncle perceiving began to enquire into his Concern Sir said the Man I bring him welcome News and the sooner he knows it the sooner I shall be easy He was invited in and his Horse taken care of The Person told my Uncle he had brought the Squire News of above Forty  Thousand Pounds That's News indeed reply'd my Uncle and welcome if it be true It's true by Gd said the Person being a blunt Sailor for I am an EyeWitness of it After the Man was refresh'd he told my Uncle that one of his Ships had made her Escape from the Pirates We were all taken said the Tar near the Coast of  Malabar  by  French  Pirates who us'd those Men that refus'd to make Part of their Crew vilely some they cut their Noses off some their Ears  c  which the major Part considering resolv'd to seem to comply 'till a fitter Opportunity shou'd offer to get out of their Clutches I understanding a little  French  was their Spokesman I told 'em we did not comply out of the Fear of Punishment but that it was what we all chose Many of us had a long time before Thoughts of running away with the Ship They receiv'd us very kindly gave us good Usage and those that did not come into their Measures were not only tortur'd as I said before but put under Confinement in Fetters We took an Opportunity to inform the poor Wretches of our Intention which made 'em repent they had not thought of the same Method Most of 'em hoping for better Usage begg'd to  be admitted but the wily  Frenchman  utterly deny'd 'em well knowing they wou'd not be true Pirates  They carry'd all their Prizes to their Rendezvous into a Bay upon the Island of  Madagascar  where we had the Liberty to go on Shore and consort among their Hellish Crew We fitted out again and took several  Chinese Joncks  richly laden and in every Engagement behav'd so well that the Captain of the Pirates set very much by us When we came back to our Rendezvous there was some Disturbance among 'em concerning some former Shares but we thought it was all hush'd They had loaded one of the largest Ships that was taken from us with Goods out of the other Two in order to go and trade with the  Dutch  at  Batavia  and one Night Seventy of the discontented Party got in her cut some that were on Board in Pieces slip'd their Anchors and stole away in the Night The next Morning the Captain was out of his Wits and the rest of the Men were as mad as himself But in short the whole Fleet which consisted of four stout Ships were sent after 'em different Ways  We steer'd  N N W  three Days and on the fourth discover'd a Sail we crouded all we cou'd to come up with her and soon perceiv'd 'twas She we wanted While they were busied in getting ready to engage I stole down into the PowderRoom which I had the Care of open'd all the Barrels and pour'd Water into most of 'em and with the rest I mix'd some of the Ballast of the Ship  When we came up with 'em a desperate Fight ensu'd as long as the good Powder lasted then I ran up to the Captain call'd him into the Cabbin where I told him in a seeming Confusion I was certain some of the Men were in the Interest of the other Ship I then inform'd him what was done to the Powder The Captain ask'd me What was to be done Board 'em Sir said I and fight 'em Sword in Hand What shall I do said he There's no trusting our own Men Why said I there's sixty  English  of us I'll engage we shall soon overcome 'em I wou'd have you reply'd the Captain inform 'em of it and tell them they shall be well rewarded  We bore off a little while we were consulting for we cou'd overtake the other Ship when we wou'd because she was heavyladen  I acquainted all my ShipMates with the Resolution I had taken and they one and all came into it When we had consulted proper Measures we bore after 'em again I inform'd the Captain when we had overcome the other Ship I wou'd put him in a Way to find out the Knaves that had plaid him that Trick He thank'd me and away we went to work We boarded her upon the StarboardQuarter enter'd her Pellmell and soon cut to Pieces those that made Resistance with the Loss of Seven  Frenchmen  and One  Englishman  for we had Fifteen  French  to assist us Six and Twenty of our Opposers call'd for  Quarter  but it was not granted before the inveterate  Frenchmen  had knock'd in the Head Nine of 'em Five more were so wounded it was thought they cou'd not live which still answer'd my Purpose The others were clap'd under Hatches and a Guard put over them  The next Day the Captain put me in mind of my Promise to find out the Guilty Sir said I call all the Men upon the QuarterDeck all I put on the LarboardSide Order to be seiz'd and clap'd under Hatches you may tax 'em with their Crime when they are secur'd tho' they deny it I'll prove  what I say upon every one of 'em before Night My Advice was follow'd the Men were call'd up to the Number of Sixty Eight Forty One I plac'd on the LarboardSide of those Men that were out of the Captain's Sight during the Engagement tho' doing their Duty The other Twenty Seven were on the Starboard The Men on both Sides cou'd not imagine the Meaning of this Division All the  Englishmen  were upon the main Deck and by some Means or other according to my Directions had their Arms about 'em those that cou'd not conceal 'em made as if they were cleaning 'em The Captain told those on the LarboardSide they were suspected to be in the Confederacy with the Runaways therefore he wou'd not have 'em take it ill if they were confin'd till their Guilt or Innocence were made to appear  They were all amaz'd at the Captain's Speech which he took for the Signs of Guilt Some were refractory but at last they consented to be confin'd well knowing their Innocence They were put under Hatches accordingly As they were going down the Captain said the Innocent shall be rewarded When they were below a Guard was set upon 'em and I had taken care to have all their Arms secur'd  The Captain then told the StarboardSide Men the whole Story and that it was by my Advice and Conduct the Ship was taken  c  The Men were surpriz'd to be sure It was pleasant to hear their Discourse they found 'em Guilty I always thought there was something in the Wind in such a Mess says one says another I even heard something of their Design last Night but as I was not sure I did not care to speak on't nay says another I believe  Jaques  suchaone had a great mind to corrupt me for he follow'd me every where Yesterday and only wanted an Opportunity of breaking his Mind to me In short most of 'em had something to say and all to prove 'em guilty It was Matter sufficient for our Mirth afterwards but I was a little too much concern'd to laugh then  The remaining  Frenchmen  were got into Cabals by Fives and Sixes all over the Deck and our  Englishmen  were impatiently expecting the Word of Command to seize 'em  When we had proceeded thus far I told the Captain if he wou'd please to go into the great Cabbin I wou'd convince him how he shou'd prove 'em When we two were there by ourselves I took a Pistol out of my  Pocket and told him I was the Man that had damag'd his Powder in order to bring that to pass which was happily effected I let him know I had gone too far not to take his Life if he resisted or call'd out and inform'd him it wou'd signify nothing if he did for I had two Signals to my Countrymen one to seize his Men and do 'em no further Hurt and the other to kill 'em all immediately And I farther added Not one of 'em shou'd suffer if they wou'd be quiet and that we only contriv'd this Stratagem to gain our Liberty  The Captain thank'd me and told me he cou'd not blame me for what I had done but wonder'd at himself that he shou'd be impos'd upon in such a manner He submitted himself to be ty'd very patiently  When I had done I went upon the Deck and gave the Word  Now  which was to seize 'em only the other was  Now do your Work  tho' I did not intend to use those Words except I had found Resistance Upon the Word the  Frenchmen  were all seiz'd It's impossible to tell their Astonishment but their Surprize was heighten'd when I brought out their Captain bound who soon let 'em into the whole Matter They were all struck  dumb for some time and then fell a gabbling out their  Mort de ma vie  like so many disturb'd Geese But tho' their Tongues were at Liberty we did 'em the Favour to bind 'em all by the Hands Some of our Men whom the others had releas'd those I mean that were ill us'd for not consenting to turn Pirates who by good Fortune were all in our Ship tho' in the  Frenchmen's  Reign did all the servile Offices of the Vessel were for cutting to Pieces those that were instrumental in their ill Usage but as they gave me the Command I order'd not one shou'd be touch'd which the  Frenchmen  thank'd me for  The One and Forty below soon found what we were at and we as soon prevail'd upon 'em to be ty'd to their good Behaviour When we had secur'd 'em all in the Steerage and Great Cabbin and order'd Centries with a great Gun charg'd with MusquetBall to fire in upon 'em if they seem'd to make any Resistance we went on Board our Prize and took care of the other ten  Frenchmen  that were set on as a Guard to the Thieves as the rest call'd 'em as if  they  were none We carry'd 'em all on Board When every thing was quiet we directed our Course for  England    and in two Days more we took every thing out of the Pirate that wou'd be useful to us in our Voyage leaving 'em a Month's Provision We secur'd all their Arms and Ammunition and cut some of their Rigging leaving 'em only a Foresail with a Main Topsail to prevent their getting into Harbour too soon for us and cause us to be pursu'd  Thus every thing being order'd as we hop'd for the best we  Englishmen  went on Board our own Ship and left them to steer their Course back to  Pirates Harbour  as we call'd it We continu'd our Voyage to  England  where we happily arriv'd meeting nothing to molest us all the way  We were mightily pleas'd with his  Narrative  and highly commended his Undertaking and Resolution Said my Uncle Mr  Bridgford  is oblig'd to you for his good Fortune and I doubt not but he will reward you accordingly He told us he was a Relation of Mr  Bridgford  's and Mate of the Ship the Captain dying when he was in the  Pirates  Hands and all he desir'd was only to make his Promise good to the Sailors which was to allow 'em double Wages for the whole Voyage My Uncle told him he  wou'd assure him of that After a little Conversation and Repast the  Messenger  was sent to Rest for he had come sixty Miles that Day upon one Horse  When he was gone we cou'd not but admire at his Conduct in the Affair and the Providence of God to Mr  Bridgford  This good Fortune said my Uncle will be a great Means of bringing on a Reconcilement Now you see Sir said I there is a Blessing attends the MarriageState Yes said my Uncle but nothing to provoke me to enter into the Noose It must bring some Cares along with it be the Comforts ever so many I fansy Sir said I there's Cares attend your present Way of Living It may be so said my Uncle but none that I am ty'd to bear  I finding a fit Opportunity thought it a proper Time to inform him of what I had heard in the  Library  but conjur'd him not to take any Notice of it 'till we cou'd find an Occasion of his being an EarWitness Well then said my Uncle I'll take your Advice and let it rest 'till after my Friend  Bridgford  's Affair is over and then we'll contrive some Way or other to catch 'em in their own Snares  The next Morning my Uncle took me along with him to wait upon the newmarry'd Couple and the  Sailor  with us We gave him Instructions to wait till we call'd for him When we came to the Lady's House we were usher'd up into the BedChamber where we found the Bride in Tears for tho' it was agreed not to open the Affair till my Uncle came yet the Husband cou'd not be easy till he had told her all She took it very heinously at first but weighing every thing well she had only Recourse to her Tears which she wip'd away as soon as she perceiv'd us  Come Sir said she to my Uncle I can now forgive your  Plot  upon me tho' I must own the Disappointment caus'd me much Uneasiness yet I find what is appointed by Heaven must be I am satisfy'd we have enough and I begin already to loath my former Temper Why now Madam said my Uncle you strike a true Harmony and to indulge it I have brought you a Present one must never come emptyhanded to a newmarry'd Pair  Billy  continu'd my Uncle call in the Man When he came in Mr  Bridgford  was surpriz'd Cousin  Brooks  said he I am very much pleas'd to see you  and this is a very acceptable Present for I thought you in the Hands of  Pirates  Pray how got you from them Why to bring home to you the good Ship  Elizabeth  reply'd Mr  Brooks  We then let him into the whole Story and he bore his  Joy  as he did his  Grief  with a Serenity of Temper he was as my Uncle said always Master of I am pleas'd with this Present from a Fortune Madam said he only that it may be a Means to make you forget some Part of your Loss in your Chimerical One She made him a suitable Reply and all past Actions were soon forgot  Mr  Bridgford  gave his Cousin  Brooks  a Ring off his Finger with a Promise of a Thousand Pounds and to make him  Captain  of the Ship he had so worthily sav'd But my Dear said the Lady you give the Gentleman a Present which I suppose he is not to dispose of but never consider he has been in the Hands of  Pirates  and perhaps all his ReadyMoney's gone and added she smiling you have not receiv'd the Money for your Jewels yet therefore I must do something for you with that she went out and immediately return'd with a hundred Guineas which she gave to Mr  Brooks  there Sir  said she that's something better than Promises however it's only as Earnest my Husband shall keep his Word  We finding her in so good a Humour took our Leaves She much intreated us to stay Dinner but my Uncle told her her Husband's old Sweetheart was to dine with him who long'd to hear how Matters went What more Confederates return'd the Lady but I forgive all and thank you for tricking me into my Happiness  As we were going home my Uncle told me he was very well pleas'd he had been instrumental in converting  one  Woman but I had almost forgot that I have one at home out of the Pale of Salvation Yet I shall not take any Pains in her Conversion if it is as you say which I believe continu'd my Uncle I shall turn her and her Cub to Grass tho' with a moderate Maintenance yet much more than they deserve But we'll let all Thoughts of that Affair sleep awhile for the Ladies will be here by and by and I have never any thing that looks like Discontent when we are together  I found a secret Pleasure in the Hopes I had of seeing the amiable  Isabella  but then intruding Fears wou'd creep in to disturb my  Thoughts I imagin'd I shou'd be slighted or perhaps she might disclose my Passion to her Mother or Aunt and then all my Hopes wou'd be intirely lost for I had not any Notion they wou'd either of 'em consent to my Desires The Time was spent between Hopes and Fears 'till the Arrival of the Ladies When they came in any one might have perceiv'd my Passion by my Countenance but they were so much taken up with their Discourse about Mr  Bridgford  's Affairs they had not the Leisure to mind any thing else My Concern was redoubled at the little Notice  Isabella  took of me and her entring so readily into the Conversation without so much as vouchsafing me a single Look almost distracted me so that I took a proper Opportunity to retire to conceal my Confusion I went into the Garden to indulge my Melancholy Finding so many Reasons to increase it that had almost distracted me I was so lost in Thought that I did not consider how the Time went away and 'tis possible I might have remain'd in my Musing till Night if a Servant had not told me Dinner was serv'd  I was in some Confusion to think what Excuse I shou'd make for my long Absence  When I came into the DiningRoom my Uncle ask'd me where I had been so long I told him I found them so very deeply engag'd in their Story that as I knew my Company wou'd not contribute any thing to the Conversation I chose to take a Walk in the Garden and my Imagination wandring I had lost myself for some time I was very much rally'd for my Speech by every body I thought said the  Aunt  the Company of  Isabella  wou'd have had sufficient Strength to have held you here I suppose return'd  Isabella  the young Gentleman has been so well tutor'd by his Uncle that he is beginning to put his Advice in Practice by shunning the Women I told her whatever Advice I follow'd of my Uncle's I was assur'd neither his Inclination or mine wou'd debar me of the Satisfaction of their Conversation whatever I suffer'd in Person or Censure I continu'd my Excuse by telling 'em the Story was not new to me and I thought it wou'd be some time before they wou'd have Leisure to enter upon any other Subject Whatever I had to say in my Justification had not stopt their Mouths if Dinner had not While it lasted I narrowly observ'd  Isabella  but cou'd not get one  Look from her I had but little Stomach as those in my Circumstances may easily imagine tho' none made any Observation upon it When Dinner was over we all walk'd in the Garden and my Endeavours to single out  Isabella  prov'd fruitless which much increas'd my Agony of Mind  In the Afternoon Mr  Bridgford  his new Wife and Mr  Brooks  the Sailor came to visit my Uncle Tho' said Mr  Bridgford  it is not usual for newmarry'd People the Day after their Wedding to make Visits yet my Wife and I thought it partly our Duty to wait upon this good Company to take our Leaves of 'em for continu'd he tho' a Week past I was no Man of Business yet now I find I have Work enough on my Hands not to mention my Matrimonial Affair I am oblig'd to leave you for Twenty Days The Smiles of Fortune must be regarded or she may change her Countenance I have experienc'd it therefore am resolv'd to keep up her GoodHumour if it lies in my Power I must own the Sorrows that touch me at present are rais'd from what I feel in parting tho' but for a short Time with such Company as will always be very dear to me Many Compliments pass'd between  the Parties but they were ended by taking Leave for Mr  Bridgford  set out for  London  from my  Uncle  's with his  Spouse  and his Kinsman the  Sailor  who found it necessary for his immediate Presence After the usual Compliment of Tea the Ladies were resolv'd to go Fish it seems it was their common Recreation and accordingly their Implements were carry'd to the River no farther than the Bottom of my Uncle's Garden I was resolv'd to be only a Lookeron as not being compos'd enough to follow the Pastime and perhaps I might have run the Hooks into my Fingers instead of the Baits Every one had tolerable good Sport but  Isabella  and her ill Luck made her fret much  Billy  said my Uncle this is a Diversion you delight in You know the Fishes retiring Holes pray see if you can help the young Lady to a little better Fortune I told my Uncle I wou'd contribute all I cou'd to  Isabella  's Entertainment with a very good Inclination Come Madam said I if you will be pleas'd to walk a little farther we'll see if Change of Place may not change your Luck She made me no Answer but with a condescending Nod follow'd me I took care to take her out of the Sight and Hearing  of the rest of the Company I then look'd a little carefully after her Bait and Tackle and she caught a Fish presently  Well said she I find my Luck is chang'd but yet I am but half reconcil'd to the barbarous Diversion it does not suit with the tender Sentiments of our Sex to rob any thing of Life neither can I see the Death of a poor  Partridge  or the most diminutive Bird widiout a secret Tenderness and Sorrow for its being robb'd of Life which it is not in our Power to restore again But yet Madam said I with all this Tenderness of Soul you can see a poor suffering Wretch in all the Agonies of Despair without thinking once of Pity I am sorry reply'd  Isabella  you shou'd tax me with a Crime I most abhor but as I am innocent it does not give me much Uneasiness Madam I reply'd I speak of Proof I am the poor suffering Wretch wounded by your resistless Charms which you know very well and you'll neither give me Death nor Ease Why indeed young Gentleman return'd  Isabella  this Playing at Lovers is what we now shou'd leave off We are too young to act in Reality and too old to act in Jest I'll allow your Understanding runs something before your  Years but to tell you ingenuously if it were otherwise I don't think for myself I have a Mother and Aunt who have the Privilege to think for me and they so worthily deserve those Characters I hope I shall never have a Thought against their Inclination I reply'd it was my Desire she never shou'd I only wish'd she wou'd have a favourable Regard for me and give me the smallest Grounds to hope I was not hateful to her She reply'd  Hate  was not in her Nature and that she cou'd say no more than that she esteem'd me equally with all Mankind and enough to be concern'd at any ill Accident that shou'd happen to me  I was so transported at this faint Glimpse of Hope she gave me that my Tongue broke out in extravagant Expressions of Thanks Hold Sir said she you'll disturb the Fish and spoil the Diversion I expect beside my Mother and Aunt will hear ypu and I have kept your former Confession from them according to your Desire but will not promise Secrecy for the Future it is a great Task for one of my Years I had not time to make her a Reply for the rest of the Company had near join'd us to know whether  Isabella  's Luck was chang'd or no Truly  said she I have no Reason to complain I have caught two with the Assistance of this young Gentleman and had like to have caught another but for want of Experience had let him go again Ay but  Billy  said my Uncle can teach you how to play a Fish up and down the Stream when once you have it fast and be in no Danger of losing it You must manage a  Fish  as you will hereafter do  Hearts  tho' I must own if handsome Women are mere Fools which is not  Isabella  's Case they soon learn that We don't allow you to be a Judge reply'd  Isabella  your Heart has been Eyeproof all your Life or else you have conceal'd that Part of it from us Why reply'd my Uncle if I have never lov'd I might have had Attempts made upon me enough to find out the Cunning of the Sex as your Aunt I suppose may answer for ours I don't desire to have the Question begg'd reply'd the Aunt but this I am sure of there's no knowing whether a Man courts the Purse or the Person For my Part return'd my Uncle I think a Woman without a Purse is but a despicable Creature I wish we cou'd find out some other Discourse return'd the Widow I think when we meet we can  never talk upon any other Subject and because we despise it I think it the best way quite to forget it  While this Discourse lasted I observ'd  Isabella  more thoughtful than usual and I cou'd not help secretly hoping I might have some Concern in her Musing Yet I was very uneasy I cou'd not get an Opportunity to speak to her the whole Evening As we were taking Leave my Uncle promis'd to Dine with 'em the third Day following and the Thought gave me some Consolation  When the Company was gone my Uncle and I walk'd in the Garden again Well said he I must own the Thoughts of the Persidy of this ungrateful Woman do not sit so easy upon me as I cou'd have wish'd in spite of all my Fortitude it stole in upon the Pleasure of the Day and sour'd my Satisfaction But continu'd he I am resolv'd to have an End put to every thing on that Account tomorrow if it's possible but I am a little at a  Nonplus  about it it wou'd vex me if we cou'd not bring it about for Doubt is a very uneasy Companion Sir said I you have a back Way up to your Study and I believe it will be no great Difficulty to steal in unobserv'd of any body You must  give it out tonight that you will be abroad tomorrow all the Morning and I must wait on you That shall be done at Supper said my Uncle 'Till that Time came my distracted Thoughts were roving on the dear  Isabella  and Hope and Fear by turns possess'd my Soul Young as I was I perceiv'd Death wou'd be more welcome to me than her Disdain At Supper my Uncle told me we shou'd rise betimes to go a Hunting with some Gentlemen that he nam'd and added he I design to take my Leave of that Diversion for some time having some Business will keep me at home for a few Days I obsev'd the Countenance of the Housekeeper and thought I saw her shut up in her Brain some secret Intention When she was gone from Table my Uncle said he did not know how to order it for it's possible she may go to this Rogue of a Lawyer and consult there and then our Project will come to nothing We must trust to that Sir said I we shall soon find it out and if it proves so we must wait till some fitter Opportunity Well said my Uncle we shall see how it proves tomorrow But  Billy  I'd have you go up into the Study unbolt the Door that leads to the BackStairs lock it only then bring me the Key  As I was coming from doing what he order'd me I took Notice the Housekeeper was busy in Talk with her Son Immediately after the Boy took his Hat and went out I told my Uncle what I had seen We both imagin'd the Boy was gone to give Notice of our going abroad the next Day for Mr the Lawyer liv'd but a little way from my Uncle's Why said my Uncle after all Suspicion strengthens our Imagination and every Action of a suspected Person alarms us I wish I cou'd be sure he is gone there That you shall presently Sir said I Upon saying that I immediately follow'd him and walking a good round Pace got Sight of him just as he rung at the Door I got time enough at the backside of the Porch unobserv'd just as the Door was open'd The Boy ask'd for Mr who came out to him presently As soon as he saw him I understood he was very fond of him and call'd him his  Dear Boy  Sir said the Boy my Mother gives her Service to you and sent me to tell you that the Squire goes out tomorrow to Hunt 'till Dinnertime and will expect you by Ten in the Morning My Love said he I'll be sure to come I won't ask you to stay now because I have  some Company with me So away went the Boy whistling home and I follow'd a more slow Pace than I went out  When I came to my Uncle I inform'd him all I had heard Well said he I find it will come to the Catastrophe tomorrow I'll go to Bed and think over my Part So we parted And I am apt to believe both our Pillows were uneasy enough Tho' my Passion kept me long awake yet I cou'd not chuse having some Concern at what wou'd happen on the Morrow When we rose in the Morning we both mounted with a Servant and after riding about a Quarter of a Mile my Uncle as we had concerted told me he had no very great Goût to the Sport therefore wou'd e'en go back again But you said he to me and  Tom  meaning the Man may go if you please No Sir said I I don't care for going without you So we turn'd our Horses Heads homewards and as we were going slowly along my Uncle order'd the Man to take all the three Horses to Town about two Mile from my Uncle's and bespeak new Saddles So we alighted walk'd over the Park and got into the Library unperceiv'd of any When we were in we bolted the Door on the Inside and  each of us took a Book in our Hands to pass away the Time till the Play was to begin for it was not proper to talk to each other but yet I believe we neither of us well knew what we were reading  The private Door we came in at was contriv'd by my Uncle that he might more conveniently make Madam a Visit unobserv'd by the Family when his Concerns call'd him and the Door of her Apartment join'd to it upon the Head of the Stairs which we soon heard open the Lawyer enter'd alone where he staid some time and diverted himself with humming a Song At last the Lady came to him who inform'd him she cou'd not come sooner being she was oblig'd to see the Coast a little clear  We soon found by the Lawyer's Discourse he had some Inclination to be merry before they talk'd of their Affairs Come come said Madam let's mind Business first we shall have time enough to divert ourselves I'll warrant you Ay but reply'd the Lawyer 'tis better to be caught in Conversation than the other Affair therefore let's make an End of that first And we soon found he was resolv'd not to be deny'd  During this Business 'twas pleasant to see my Uncle's Countenance which was compos'd of half a Smile about one fourth Part Shame as I suppose to have me a sort of an Auditor in this unlook'dfor dumb Work and the other Fourth Anger I believe such a Face cou'd not be compounded out of  Le Brun  's  Passions  When their loving Affair was over Consultation came on  Well said the Lady what's to be done I have Reason to fear every thing for I find this Boy grows upon him every Day To tell you the Truth reply'd the  Lawyer  I'm at a Fault and have lost the Scent and know not how to proceed I know you Women are more fruitful in Inventions of this kind Indeed if the Squire's Head were once laid I cou'd find an Expedient to secure the best Part of the Estate without Danger or finding out 'Tis not the first time I have disinherited the True Heir without the Consent of the Predecessor even for a small Sum and you may be sure I shou'd use my utmost Skill for  Thomas  who is our own Child tho' the Squire I believe imagines himself sole Proprietor in  You  and  Him  It's a very perplexing thing I vow reply'd the Housekeeper I wish both their Necks  broke today in Hunting with all my Heart Ay that wou'd do reply'd the Lawyer I'd find a Will by tomorrow Night like  Moscas  in the  Fox  shou'd disappoint every boby else without coming near his Punishment Well I hope it's no Crime return'd the Housekeeper to wish 'em both in Heaven nay if I lent a helping Hand to fit 'em for their Journey I believe my Conscience wou'd be as drowsy as if it had sip'd off a Dose of  Laudanum  Oh fy return'd the Lawyer let us not think of Murder however tho' if we were in  Italy  I cou'd soon procure a Tradesman or two that deal that way wou'd do the Work neatly and very cheap too But let us not think of that any farther than in our good Wishes And now let me hear what you can propose What Readymoney does he generally keep at home Not that I purpose to rob him I have a better Principle Or what  Bank  or  Goldsmiths  Notes has he at a time I don't know reply'd the Housekeeper he keeps himself very close as to those Matters and I seldom see any of his Money but his paltry Hundred a Year that he allows me and what I can ship out of Housekeeping cutting off Tradesmen's Bills and so sorth which does not amount to above Fifty more  Come come return'd the Lawyer that's good Pay only for rubbing a Man's Head that's turn'd of  Fifty  he does not give you much Trouble I believe I wonder how you wou'd conceal your Joy to see that Head we speak of dangling over the Horse's Tail brought home as  Crookback'd Richard  's was with his Neck broke That wou'd be a joyful Sight indeed return'd the virtuous Housekeeper My Uncle cou'd bear no more but rush'd in upon them just as she had ended But since I have sav'd my Neck hitherto return'd my Uncle I am resolv'd to hunt less that I may not cause such an Alteration in your Minds for those violent Emotions of the Soul often endanger the Body  Perseus  's Shield cou'd not have a greater Effect on those that saw it than the Presence of my Uncle had upon those two Wretches for they both stood like Statues but my Uncle put a little Life into the Lawyer with his Cane yet not being fully reviv'd he ran round the Room several times before he cou'd find the Door At every Stroke of Acknowledgment my Uncle gave him for the Favours design'd him he expostulated with him and to end his Favours kick'd him down Stairs telling him he wou'd not take  any other Revenge because indeed he did not think it worth while but bid him go like a Villain as he was and let his Crime be his Punishment But if he offer'd to make any Words in the Affair he wou'd find some other Method besides exposing him to have him punish'd  The Lawyer made no Reply and I believe thought himself very well off Neither was there much Fear of his Tattling because it wou'd only expose himself Now came the Lady's Share of the Matter who stood quaking and trembling in a Corner of the Room Will your Ladyship be pleas'd said my Uncle with your utmost Expedition to pack up your Trumpery and walk off All the ill Usage you may expect from me is to forget you tho' I think no Punishment bad enough for you Neither shall I leave you or your Brat to starve who in deed is innocent but allow him the Hundred Pounds a Year for his Life that he may not suffer for the Faults of his Parents Go continu'd my Uncle let me have no Reply take what you can with you and send for the rest when you think fit She went down Stairs follow'd by my Uncle and when she had taken a few Things went out without  opening her Mouth but whether Grief or Anger ty'd her Tongue I can't tell When she was gone my Uncle order'd all her Things to be put together ready against they were sent for to the great Surprize of the rest of the Servants  After Dinner my Uncle took me with him to Town to a Lawyer of his Acquaintance and order'd him to fill up a Deed that made his Estate liable to a Hundred Pounds  per Annum  to be paid during the Life of the Housekeeper's Son tho' not quite Fourteen I was made one of the Witnesses The next Morning my Uncle order'd it to be sent to his Mother for her to be satisfy'd but the Lawyer that made it was to be the Trustee whose Honesty and Probity were as great as the other's Villainy We then set out for the Widow's House and my Uncle told me in the Coach he was resolv'd to be merry notwithstanding this Bustle that happen'd And young Man said he  You  have  sufficient  Cause for Mirth at what has fall'n out for your Estate will be increas'd for if I had made my Will before or not have found 'em out I shou'd have left 'em more considerably  When we came to the Widow's my Uncle told 'em the whole Story and they all  seem'd mightily pleas'd upon my Account for they imagin'd the Son of the Housekeeper was to have been Heir Yet I fansy'd  Isabella  's Countenance seem'd the least concern'd which struck me to the Soul After Dinner I got the happy Opportunity of being alone with her tho' I imagin'd it was with much Regret on her Side Madam said I my Uncle's expected Fortune does not give me half that Satisfaction as this Opportunity if you wou'd be pleas'd to consider my Passion I have consider'd it so far Sir return'd  Isabella  that I desire we may think of it no more The Answer she gave struck me dumb with Grief and it was some time before my troubled Heart permitted my Tongue to speak Well Madam then said I you have resolv'd my Death I own even the Hopes of Fortune do not give me Merit enough to raise my Eyes to such a Pitch of Happiness But Time that produces very strange things may befriend me in That I have told you Sir return'd the young Lady our Years are too few to admit of Love but whenever I shall feel the gentle Flame I have very good Reasons to believe I shall not much consult Fortune I am convinc'd that MoneyMatches are not always the happiest  yet the first thing ask'd in this Age is  What Fortune has she  If that answers their Expectations then they proceed if not they look out farther and barter for a Wife as they wou'd for a Set of CoachHorses  In all our Discourse I had some Hope because I cou'd not find any Grounds for hating me neither cou'd I prevail upon her to declare any thing in favour of me Her general Answer was her Want of Years yet she told me she had Discretion enough to conceal my Passion for her and she wou'd often say her Reason was that if a Person cou'd not have an Inclination for a Lover yet they ought to have some Regard for 'em I was pressing her to give me some Token that I was not indifferent to her when my Uncle came in and interrupted us It was I own the first time I ever thought his Company a Trouble Come young Man said he you'll be suspected you have been together a long time The Mother and Aunt sent me to part you Besides yonder's Matter for the young Lady's Tears the Burial of two Lovers We all went into the Garden and saw two Coffins bearing to the Church We were told the young Man  had liv'd in the Neighbourhood and courting a young Woman of the next Parish her Father had prevail'd upon her to marry another of a better Estate which occasion'd the young Man's Death for the Morning of the Marriage was the last of his Life making the River his WindingSheet The Bride and Bridegroom coming from Church were stop'd by his Corpse lying in their Way the melancholy Object had such an Effect upon the Bride that she fell down speechless on the Body and in a few Days expir  d with Grief And her last Request was to be bury'd together  The Story made us all very melancholy and  Isabella  cou'd not forbear shedding Tears at the Relation but we rally'd one another out of our Sorrow Methinks said the Mother this Story wou'd make a very good tender Ballad You need not fear the Ballad reply'd the Aunt by some  Grubstreet  Bard or other Why said my Uncle can't you make a Ballad  Billy  I have seen some of your Translations from  Ovid  's  Elegies  and such a dismal Subject in my Imagination will fit your Muse to a Hair  Isabella  seem'd mighty fond of such a Thing tho' I declin'd it as having never drank of  the Streams of  Helicon  But when we came home I sat down and lanch'd out tho' I did not understand how to steer my Muse But the Hopes of pleasing  Isabella  made me embark and the next Day I sent her the following Letter by a Servant of my Uncle's with a Charge to deliver it into her own Hands  MADAM  IN the pleasing Hope of giving you some small Satisfaction I have ventur'd to walk out into the Field of Poetry And tho' perhaps I have gather'd Weeds yet you must consider it is for want of Knowledge in the amiable Flowers But I had rather err in endeavouring to please you than not to obey your Commands I beg you will not expose 'em I know you have GoodNature enough not to let any one else laugh at my Want of Numbers Consider all the Faculties of my Soul are yours and I fear poor  Damon  's Fate will be mine for I am assur'd I neither cou'd or wou'd survive his Fortune But I too much doubt if it comes to that I shall never after Death meet with the same Pity as the unfortunate  Damon  I fear what I have already writ has disgusted you but consider it comes from one  that shall ever esteem it his only Happiness to subscribe himself  Your eternal Admirer c  THE BALLAD  I  DAMON  whose tuneful Pipe had Charms  To wound and heal the wondring Throng  Long courted  CAELIA  to his Arms  'Twas  CAELIA  that inspir'd his Song  II  The lovely Virgin joys to hear  His thrilling Pipe and humble Verse  Yet frowns when Sighs his Pains declare  Regardless of his Happiness  III  A sullen Swain whose Wealth was great  By Force of Gold her Parent gains  Poor  DAMON  he bewails his Fate  In sighing melancholy Strains  IV  And thus complains Accursed Gold  Thou base Betrayer of my Love  Mean are the Hearts are bought or sold  'Tis Int'rest does the Fair One move  V  The Nuptial Day was fixt and near  Which added to poor  DAMON's  Smart  Who ev'ry Moment dropt a Tear  The Prelude to a broken Heart  VI  The dusky Morn came low'ring on  When all for Church prepare to go  The sable Clouds obscur'd the Sun  As loth to see the Lover's Woe  VII  The jocund Bridegroom swell'd with Joy  Ey'd  CAELIA  as he pass'd along  Exulting o'er the lovesick Boy  Who faintly press'd among the Throng  VIII  With wat'ry Eyes he view'd the Bride  Who seeing  DAMON  sigh'd aloud  And trembling by the Bridegroom's Side  The Wonder of the gazing Crowd  IX  Some pity'd  DAMON  others rail  Such Wretches are no Friends to Love  On such the God will ne'er prevail  To sigh within the  Paphian  Grove  X  Poor Slaves to low and base Desires  'Tis Love that newcreates the Mind  Without his pleasing gentle Fires  We're sordid  Metal  unrefin'd  XI  DAMON  depress'd with mortal Grief  Walks slowly by the River's Side  By Hope forsaken No Relief  And all his Thoughts were on the Bride  XII  Ye murm'ring Streams the Shepherd cry'd  Who oft have heard my plaintive Voice  Convey my Body to the Bride  And shew that Death is now my Choice  XIII  Fond Love farewell Adieu vain Dream  Farewell to ev'ry Grief and Pain  Thus said he plung'd amid the Stream  And ne'er rose up to Life again  XIV  The rapid Torrent rolls him down  Depriv'd alas of breathing Life  Regardless now of  CAELIA  's Frown  Who now returns a Virgin Wife  XV  The Stream repenting of the Deed  Threw  DAMON  's Corpse upon the Grass  Scarce cold from Worldly Troubles freed  Where  CAELIA  and her Train must pass  XVI  But when she view'd the wellknown Face  And knew each pale dead Feature there  She cry'd poor  DAMON  hapless Case  My stubborn Heart was too severe  XVII  But why do I accuse my Heart  'Twas always thine poor lifeless Boy  In all thy Pains it bore a Part  A Part in ev'ry Grief or Joy  XVIII  My rigid Parent caus'd this Woe  Whose flinty Heart no Love can prove  'Tis he has wrought thy Overthrow  And robb'd me of my only Love  XIX  But since on Earth we cou'd not wed  This only Comfort still I have  My Heart shall join our Hands tho' dead  We'll keep our Nuptials in the Grave  XX  Then kneeling down his Lips she press'd  And eager clasp'd his pale cold Hand  The other beat her troubled Breast  While all the Hearers wondring stand  XXI  Come gentle Death the Virgin cry'd  Give  DAMON  to my longing Breast  She sighing wept and sighing dy'd  Replete with Woe and sunk to Rest  When the Servant return'd he inform'd me he had given it into her own Hands unperceiv'd of any one I shew'd my Uncle the Song who told me he believ'd it as good as any of the  Grubstreet  Quilldrivers cou'd write but he wou'd not allow it to be a Degree better however said he it may please the Women well enough who seldom consider Sense but Sound I reply'd I was to be excus'd it being my first Essay and very probably might be my last  While we were at Dinner a Messenger came with a Letter from my Father desiring my Uncle to let me come home for a few Days in order to get every thing ready for the University when that was done I shou'd return and stay with him till I was to go there My Uncle agreed to it and wou'd accompany me himself Sir said I wou'd it not be proper to wait upon the Ladies to take Leave Ho return'd my Uncle are you so loth to part with 'em for so short a Time What will you do when you are at the University where you must not return for the first Year For a whole Year Sir said I Is there a Necessity for staying so long before I wait on you or any of my Relations Yes reply'd my Uncle if you wou'd be thought to mind your Studies but I can't perceive continu'd he there is a Necessity for going there at all and that is the Reason why I shall wait on your Worship to your Father to endeavour to persuade him to let you and your Tutor be with me I dare answer for you it will not hinder the Progress of your Learning you shall want neither Masters Books nor Money and I am convinc'd the Universities often spoil more Youth than they cultivate with good Education  Youth is like Wax fit for any Impression they as soon take an ill as a good one Tho' I must own I have nothing to fear from you and I freely confess 'tis the Regret I have to part with you makes me desire your not going to the University tho' if it does not agree with your Sentiments I shall say no more about it I told him I was very well inclin'd to it and cou'd not but agree with his Thoughts Well then said my Uncle we'll away immediately and if it's possible return tomorrow I hope that short Absence from the Ladies will not break your Heart  I made him no Reply but went to prepare for my Journey with a good Inclination for I must own I long'd to see my Father and observe how Matters were carry'd on at home not doubting but my Motherinlaw was still in the Way of Goodness tho' I had receiv'd no Recommendation from her either in my Father's Letter or by the Messenger but I knew my Father seldom regarded those formal Matters  As we came within three Mile of my Father's my Uncle's Servant stopt a Horse that was running away without his Rider and a little farther we cou'd perceive a Man lying  weltring in Blood when we approach'd him we found him senseless and I was something surpriz'd to find it the Surgeon that had the Care of me when I was wounded by my Brother My Uncle was as much concern'd as I was when he knew who it was We took him up and found his Scull was fractur'd but we did not doubt if we cou'd get timely Aid but he might be recover'd We put him into my Uncle's Coach and drove to the next Town with all the Expedition was consistent with the Surgeon's Condition by good Fortune we met with one of his own Acquaintance and Profession who took him in Hand dress'd him and brought him to his Senses tho' with much Fear of his Life he being a gross Man a Fever had seiz'd the Blood and all agreed his Life was in Danger However he seem'd very much pleas'd to find me so near him and I had some Thoughts it might prove a convenient Opportunity to work out that Secret he inform'd me he knew of my Motherinlaw but finding it not proper to talk much I resolv'd with myself to come to him again So we took our Leaves and arriv'd safe at my Father's who not expecting us the same Day he sent to us was gone to visit a neighbouring Gentleman  My Mother seem'd very much rejoic'd at our Arrival and welcoming me with Tears her Tenderness gave me no small Satisfaction My Brother  John  indeed look'd as glum upon me as if I had been come to rob him of his Birthright My Uncle perceiving his Behaviour rattled him in his merry way but it had no other Effect than bringing Tears into his Eyes and running to tell Mama Zounds says my Uncle when he was gone what a Country Cub it is Why don't they put him Prentice to a Farmer for he'll never be fit for any thing but to follow the Plough  When my Father came home he told my Uncle he did not think he shou'd have comply'd with his Desires so soon as not expecting me in two or three Days Why said my Uncle we made the more Expedition here that we may return the sooner and because you shou'd not keep him too long I came with him to carry him back In short the Matter was made up that Night It was agreed my Tutor and I shou'd go back with my Uncle I must own I was not a little pleas'd for I fear'd the good Woman my Motherinlaw might oppose it but she readily consented to save Charges I suppose  While I was walking in the Garden alone  Betty  came up to me and wept for Joy to see me Well said I  Betty  how go Matters between you and my Mother Is the Affair made up I hope I am to take no more  Physic  The poor Girl was ready to sink at the Word  Physic  Indeed Sir said she after a long Pause I believe you know every thing of former Affairs but if you do you also know I have sufficiently repented of my Part and I hope my Mistress has of hers I gave her so many Hints that she confess'd every thing I was struck with Horror at her Relation for she discover'd such Traps they had design'd to get rid of me that I thought it almost impossible they shou'd enter into the Minds of Women Sir said  Betty  you may find by my Story I am at a true Confession nay I wou'd kneel down at your Feet for Pardon if it might not be observ'd by any body I told her I had pardon'd her long ago as well as my Mother who might have had something of a stronger Tye to use me well than she I hope said  Betty  she has forgot what is past or if she remembers it 'tis only as I do to think with Horror on what was design'd and a high Satisfaction in knowing we are innocent  of the Fact tho' pursu'd she there does not seem to be that Candour and Freedom between us as there was when we were wickedly caballing against your innocent Life therefore I have some Intention of leaving her Service and going to my Relations in  Wales  where I hope I have enough to last me moderately all my Life I told her I was assur'd my Uncle wou'd accept of her for his Housekeeper upon my Recommendation if she thought fit for at present he had never a one She seem'd mightily rejoic'd at the Proposal telling me it was the only Thing she shou'd desire I bid her not take any Notice of it to any body till she heard from me again which she promis'd and we parted  The next Day I took an Opportunity early in the Morning to visit the  Surgeon  and found him much better than any one expected tho' he himself had no Thoughts of Recovery He told me he was very much oblig'd to me for the Care I had taken of him and notwithstanding he was convinc'd his End was near yet he thought Providence had a Hand in sending me to his Assistance therefore as I wou'd not willingly go out of the World said he without acquainting you  with what I had formerly hinted to you for fear you shou'd nourish the Opinion that I wanted only to create Uneasiness without any Grounds therefore if you please now I find I have Strength enough I'll acquaint you with all I know if you'll order the Room to be clear'd for a little while which was soon done I sat down by his Bedside when he began as follows  You know we CountrySurgeons are generally bred Apothecaries I serv'd my Time with one eminent in both Faculties and it was allow'd by every body I was not behindhand in my Master's Experience He us'd to trust his Patients in general to me after my Capacity had been thought equal to such a Charge  Sir  Charles  your Motherinlaw's former Husband liv'd near die Town and my Master was very great there insomuch that it was thought the Knight was in a fair Road to Heaven with my Master's Assistance but it is often the Fate of Cuckolds to be one of the last in discovering his own Horns For several Years the Knight and my Master were very gracious They often rid a Hunting together But one Day when it was suppos'd my Master wanted an Opportunity  of conversing with the Knight's Wife took an Occasion of leaving him making all the Haste he cou'd to visit the Lady The Knight missing my Master tho' not mistrusting any thing of the Matter went home likewise and going up to his Lady's Chamber found the Door shut but peeping thro' the Keyhole perceiv'd she had got his Companion with her and both in a Posture not very decent The Knight being neither a  Hercules  nor an  Ajax  stood some time to consider what he shou'd do as he told me afterwards but at last summoning all his Courage he burst the Door open and surpriz'd 'em very disadvantageously giving my Master several Strokes upon the naked Buttocks ere he cou'd put up the proper Covering but being a goodhumour'd easy Man and a  Wittol  to boot at their Tears and Entreaties forgave 'em both but wou'd not allow of my Master's Correspondence any more When any thing was wanted from the Shop I always carry'd it till by degrees I got into the good Graces of the Knight and rid out a Hunting with him tho' not so often as my Master us'd to do but I believe he gave me Leave more readily that he might have a better Opportunity of visiting the Lady  In one of the Knight's drunken Moods he discover'd what I have told you between his Wife and my Master which I was ignorant of before but said he they have promis'd me never to do the like again I only smil'd at his Simplicity and confirm'd him in his Belief tho' I was pretty well convinc'd when I look'd a little backwards they only met as often as they had an Opportunity In a few Days after this Confession when I was a Hunting with him he seem'd to be less merry than usual I ask'd him the Reason He told me he believ'd his Wife continu'd to see my Master in a criminal manner tho' he was not convinc'd by Proof I ask'd him the Reason of his Belief Said he going into my Wife's Chamber this Morning as she was dressing herself a Letter drop'd from her Bosom which I took up and was well assur'd 'twas your Master's Hand I open'd it and had but just time to read  My Dear  when my Wife in some Confusion snatch'd it out of my Hand and told me it was a Letter from a Relation of hers I told her I was assur'd it was the Doctor's Hand Well said she if you are jealous you shan't see it now but I'll give you Leave to read it when you come back from Hunting I  was forc'd to be satisfy'd continu'd the Knight but I shall be convinc'd 'tis so if she pretends to have lost the Letter The Knight took an Opportunity of seeing me the same Evening He told me with a great deal of Joy in his Countenance that he was deceiv'd See here the Letter that gave me so much Uneasiness I took it from him and soon knew my Master's Hand tho' he had endeavour'd to write not like himself  I cou'd not chuse but smile at the Cheat that was put upon him it was plain enough that she had acquainted my Master with the Matter and while the Knight was gone a Hunting he wrote her another in a Woman's Name beginning as the other did about nothing at all to any Purpose I was convinc'd in my Supposition when I came home for my Master pulling out a Parcel of Papers gave me one to take Directions for compounding some Medicines I soon found it was the Father to the Letter the Knight shewed some time before for it began as the other did and Sir  Charles  's Name was mention'd in it I told my Master smiling I cou'd find no Directions there for me Odso said he I have given you the wrong Letter that neither concerns you nor me He immediately  fumbled out the right one and went away in some Confusion of Countenance I was very uneasy myself that he knew I had discover'd the Secret of his Intrigue tho' it cou'd not properly be call'd a Secret that was whisper'd every where  Some time after my Master was caught again making the Beast with two Backs with the Knight's Wife which so enrag'd the Cuckold that he resolv'd to have Recourse to Law for Redress but as I was now his Oracle I persuaded him from it tho' with some Difficulty and in a little time his Resentment began to sleep again tho' he watch'd his Wife so narrowly there cou'd be no Time to graft another Antler for I must own to you I did all I cou'd to prevent it giving him Notice when I suspected any Movement that way Yet I must confess had it been my own Case I shou'd sooner have thought of revenging myself on the Cuckoldmaker than bore it so patiently but there is nothing to be said for the Tempers of Men  This Strictness continu'd for near half a Year and I verily believe much to the Discontent of the Lady At last the Knight fell sick perhaps thro' his Perturbation of  Spirit or for want of his usual Exercise for he had undertaken a voluntary Confinement in order to inspect the Actions of his Wife During his Illness she seem'd very tender of him hardly ever being from his Bedside which the goodnatur'd Knight took so kindly that I even fansy'd he was resolv'd when he was recover'd to leave her to her own Conduct for she express'd so much Sorrow for her past Actions that I was myself deceiv'd The Disposition to Goodness of the Wife had an extraordinary Effect on the Husband and he began to mend apace He left his Bed where thro' Weakness he had remain'd for ten Days and walk'd about his Chamber gathering Strength hourly in less Time than his Illness had kept him in Bed He had recover'd his former Strength and had fixt a Day with me to ride out but in the mean time he was to take some Physic which I sent him but to my great Surprize and Confusion the Day he had taken it I found him expiring in the utmost Agonies He was speechless when I came to him and in less than five Minutes breath'd his last  The Lady was all in Tears rav'd at me telling me I had certainly given him something by Mistake I assur'd her to the contrary  and inform'd her it was compos'd by my Master before my Face and what he had taken cou'd not hurt an Infant She held her Tongue when she understood who it was that had made up what he took which immediately struck my Fancy there was some Villainy in the Case  My Master hearing of the Knight's Death came while I was there and examining the Body seem'd in very great Confusion We both went home together without one Word passing between us When we had been there some time my Master told me he had something to disclose if I wou'd swear solemnly to keep it a Secret I answer'd him if he was in any doubt of my Fidelity to keep the Secret to himself Well then said he give me your Word not to discover it and I will tell you which I did  I am afraid said he the Knight has not had fair Play for his Life for viewing his Body I cou'd easily perceive strong Symptoms of Poison and what strengthens my Opinion is that some time ago she prevail'd upon me to let her have some  Ratsbane  in order as she said to clear the Granary of Vermin I easily came into my Master's Opinion and by his declaring it to me  was well assur'd he was innocent I am so shock'd said my Master at the Barbarity of the Woman that I am resolv'd never to go near her more neither will I make any further Enquiry into the Business but leave her to her own wicked Thoughts Tho' perhaps I have not in my past Days had any great Regard for Religion and might leave it to be decided by Chance as the King of  Macasar  did  Macasar  is a large Kingdom on the South Part of the  Celebes  an Island in the  Indian Sea  Near three Centuries ago they worshipp'd the Sun and Moon as the most worthy Objects of their Adoration Two  Macasarian  Merchants trading to  Ternate  the chief of the  Molucca  Islands settled by the  Portuguese  were so well pleas'd with the Integrity of the Priests and the Tenets of the Christian Religion that their chief Business was to make themselves perfect in it which lik'd 'em so well that they were soon Baptiz'd and returning into their own Country prevail'd upon the King of  Macasar  to follow their Steps which was soon done with a great Number of the Inhabitants that were Christen'd But the Priests that were sent by the  Portuguese  to instruct 'em in the Christian Religion miscarrying in their Voyage the King began to have Doubts which none of the new Christians cou'd answer Some  Mahometans  being at the Court when these Doubts arose recommended the  Alcoran  to him and by their Reasons began to stagger his new Faith Yet still continuing a Friend to the Christian Religion he resolv'd to put his Choice on this Hazard He gave Commission to the Christians and  Mahometans  to send for Teachers of both Religions and the first that arriv'd whether Christian or  Mahometan  shou'd be allow'd the Establish'd Religion The Followers of  Mahomet  sent without losing Time to the Queen of  Acihn  a Kingdom on the Island of  Sumatra  one that follow'd the Laws of  Mahomet  the Queen immediately dispatch'd several learned  Bonzi's  or Priests who arriv'd before the Christians And ever since the People of  Macasar  have been zealous  Mahometans    Yet she has so alarm'd my drowsy  Conscience that I shall for the future endeavour to lead a Life consonant to one that thinks of Futurity We both agreed it was the best way to be silent in the unhappy Affair  In a few Days the Knight was bury'd without the least Suspicion of any thing but a Natural Death My Master and I were invited to the Funeral but neither of us went And for my own Part I never car'd to go near the House for the Thought of its harbouring so cruel a Woman made me abhor it My Master I believe imagin'd the same for he never made the Widow a Visit In a Fortnight after the Funeral she sent a Letter to my Master which was to this Effect for he gave it to me to read having before that freely declar'd to me the Correspondence that had past between 'em  She wonder'd  mightily at his long Absence and that she wou'd have come to him long before if Decency wou'd have permitted her but she hop'd to see him that Evening having dispos'd every thing to favour their Meeting  My Master return'd her an Answer I believe little to her Expectation telling her plainly he resolv'd never to see her more also hinting her unnatural Barbarity to her Husband I can't tell you what Effect it had upon her but she sent no more Letters or Messages I often told my Master I was afraid she wou'd resent his slighting of her to his Prejudice He laugh'd at that as imagining himself out of her Power But in less than a Month's time my unfortunate Master going to visit a Relation about ten Miles from the Place where we liv'd was found murder'd and thrown into a Copse near the Road He lay several Days before he was found and might have laid longer if a Gentleman had not gone thro' that Way a Hunting I must confess my Heart forboded some such Mischance when sending to seek him at his Relation's was inform'd he went from thence the same Evening he came there  Great Inquisition was made after the Murderer but was never found to this Day yet whoever did it I was well assur'd within my self the Widow had put 'em on but as I cou'd not bring any Proof I kept my Opinion to myself well knowing if I shou'd endeavour to prosecute her it wou'd be a certain Charge to me and perhaps discover nothing Yet I must own I cou'd never give her a good Word and tho' I had always a Watch upon my Tongue yet I cou'd not avoid raving against her in all Companies  Some time after the Death of my Master I imagin'd I had found out the Murderer A Trooper that was quarter'd in the Town of a sudden had got into the Equipage of a Gentleman and it was shrewdly suspected he occupy'd the Widow I was convinc'd in my Suspicion One Morning early being call'd to one that was taken suddenly ill and being oblig'd to pass by the Widow's Door I cou'd perceive tho' dark her Door open and this Trooper mention'd before let in by the Widow herself This Fellow whenever he pass'd by our Shop I cou'd perceive always a sudden Turn of Countenance from what he had on before One Day as he was passing by some of my Neighbours were talking  with me concerning the Murder of my late Master and I cou'd not help saying loud enough to be heard by the Trooper that I suspected a Person that often pass'd by our Door had been his Murderer and look'd full in the Fellow's Face He chang'd as pale as Ashes But all the while I staid in that Town which was upward of two Years afterwards I never set Eyes on him and the next time I saw him I found him lurking about your Father's House which convinces me not only that he was the Murderer of my Master but that he corresponds with your Motherinlaw at this Time  Now Sir added the Doctor I have told you this Secret which I have kept near Seventeen Years neither shou'd I have discover'd it now if I did not firmly believe I am going into another World for notwithstanding every one tells me I am much better I am convinc'd I have not ten Days to live I endeavour'd to put him out of that idle Conceit but all to no purpose So I took my Leave after promising him to keep his Secret and within the Time he mention'd I was inform'd he dy'd after telling the very Hour of his Death I return'd home full of many disjointed Thoughts wondering  how Providence had order'd my Father to marry such a wicked Woman But then again I did not doubt but she had repented of her former Wickedness and walk'd in the Paths towards Grace which gave me some Comfort but not enough to hinder my wishing she never had been one of our Family  Betty  had told me nothing of this Affair neither was I assur'd she liv'd with her at that time but I was resolv'd to be inform'd the first Opportunity In the Afternoon I took an Occasion to get my Tutor out of the way and being alone beckon'd  Betty  to come to me Pray said I  Betty  do you know any thing of my Mother's former Husband Sir  Charles  No Sir said she I came to live with my Lady not long before her Marriage to your Father But said I know you nothing of a Galant of my good Motherinlaw's for I have some Reason to suspect her of being guilty that way Indeed said she blushing that is the only Thing I have kept a Secret from you and I believe the very Reason of my Lady's Coldness to me for the Person she corresponds with or rather the Person she has corresponded with for I have great Hopes she has left it off coming to me as usual I flatly deny'd him Entrance  and farther told him I was assur'd my Lady wou'd break off with him being asham'd of the Injury she had done so good a Husband I never acquainted my Lady with what I said to him but I observ'd her Coldness took beginning some time after this I ask'd her what sort of Person he was She told me a young Gentleman of a very good Family fallen to Decay who she believ'd was forc'd thro' Necessity to what he did That can't be the Person said I that I suspect for he I mean must be above Forty There is said  Betty  sometimes a Man of that Age with my Lady but she ever took care to keep their Affair private even from me but however I am assur'd there is no criminal Conversation between 'em  I did not tell  Betty  any thing that I knew of what the Doctor inform'd me but we parted with an Assurance of my succeeding with my Uncle in what I promis'd her In the Afternoon my Uncle rid out with me when I broke the Matter about  Betty  I thought said my Uncle you had enough of Housekeepers already Sir said I I have enough of such a one as your last neither am I afraid of any great Familiarity between you for  Betty  is neither young nor handsome  Nay said my Uncle I can give you a better Reason than all that which I am assur'd you'll soon come into and that is I am not so young by Twenty Years as I was Twenty Years ago That's true Sir said I but I am flatter'd I can give you a better Reason that you shou'd accept of  Betty  that is it is the only Thing I can desire of you Well said my Uncle your Desires shall be granted But we must limit  Betty  's Power for you know the former had all in her own Hands I told him I wanted nothing else but that she might be accepted we would both leave the Terms to him But hold said my Uncle I have one Scruple just now arose concerning this Affair which must be got over and that is whether my Sister will be willing to part with her Sir said I if you will hear me a little while with Patience and give me your Word never to disclose what I shall tell you I will inform you of something will very much surprize you Well said my Uncle I shall come to your Terms be they what they will  I then related to him all that had happen'd while I was at home in every Circumstance When I had finish'd my Uncle was quite confounded Is it possible said he there  can be such a Woman breathing If I did not give Credit to you continu'd he I shou'd have imagin'd I had heard a Romance But however I am convinc'd and think my Service for  Betty  but poor Recompence for her Return to Virtue But I know not how to look on that injurious Woman who may under the Cover of Affection still retain her Barbarity I think it wou'd be but just and reasonable to give my Brother some Hint of her former Inhumanity A Woman of her Cunning may counterfeit Virtue when she is replete with Vice I beg'd my Uncle not to take any farther Notice of it 'till we had some Grounds of her returning to Wickedness and if we shou'd find the least swerving from Virtue to bring  Betty  for Proof of what was past and put my Father out of all manner of Danger from her Wiles or Resentment  I know not said my Uncle I like it not and shall hardly be persuaded to conceal the Knowledge of her Perfidy You know the old Saying Boy  What's bred in the Bone is never out of the Flesh  Dear Uncle said I let me intreat you to conceal what I have told you till we perceive something in her Conduct to give us Cause to suspect her again  and then you may do just as you please He promis'd to comply with my Request which gave me no small Satisfaction  When we came home we found my Father and Motherinlaw very merry in the Garden but finding myself little inclin'd to Mirth I left my Uncle to make one of the Company Beside I wanted to confer with  Betty  but cou'd not find her all over the House I imagin'd she might be walking under the Trees before the House so upon that Supposition went to seek her when I had got thro' the CourtYard I perceiv'd  Betty  was not there but I cou'd not help observing an old Woman prying about the House with a Basket upon her Arm I went to her and demanding of her whether she had any Business there she answer'd she had some fine Oranges for my Lady My Lady is at present busy said I but pray let me see your Oranges which she did after some aukward Difficulty Her Reluctance in shewing me her Fruit rais'd a Suspicion in my Mind which made me resolve to be satisfy'd if possible They are fine Oranges good Woman said I and I believe my Lady will buy 'em all But I wish you had some Peaches for I have a great Mind to  some and wou'd give a good Price for 'em I wish I had known that said the old Woman I cou'd have brought you some of the finest in  England  I told her if she wou'd go back and fetch 'em I shou'd be very much oblig'd to her You may leave your Basket in that GreenHouse to secure 'em I'll lock the Door and give you the Key She seem'd willing to consent to that so I did as I said gave her the Key and away she went As soon as she was out of Sight I went the Backway and got into the GreenHouse thro' the Window I began to examine her Basket very narrowly yet found nothing that I expected to find but handling the Oranges I perceiv'd one of 'em to be very light and at last found it was hollow I undid it with much Difficulty for it was put together with Pins without Heads In it I found a Slip of Paper roll'd up whose Contents I transcrib'd with a Pencil  MY DEAR  I  AM out of my Senses  Burleigh  has been with me and threatens to discover both you and me to your Husband and farther adds if you miss sending him Fifty Pounds in three Days he will declare a Secret that will endanger  your Life and yet escape himself I know not what he means but if he has any such Secret the best way will be to stop his Mouth by sending him the Money Shall we never meet again Consider how long it is since you blest me last I am amaz'd at the Treatment I receiv'd from  Betty  And notwithstanding in your last you gave me Hopes of a sudden Meeting yet I am apt to believe she spoke Truth when she declar'd you wou'd shake of all Commerce with me Therefore if you wou'd not have me believe her let me see you tomorrow at the Bearer's House where I shall wait the whole Day with impatient Expectation If you will comply and have not an Opportunity of Writing tell her  All's well  and by those Words I shall be satisfy'd till tomorrow For ever Yours  S W  When I had done I put it up again and with much Difficulty left it in the same Order as I found it I then return'd to expect the Woman I really imagin'd by this Letter that my Motherinlaw design'd to be honest and what she had wrote to her Galant was only a Pretext to keep him quiet However I did design to suspend my Judgment  till the next Day and if I perceiv'd my Mother went to the Place appointed it wou'd not be unnatural to believe her still guilty  When the Woman brought me the Peaches I ask'd her if I shou'd acquaint my Mother that she was there Yes Sir said she if you please and thank you too I immediately went and met her coming out of the Garden When I told her who wanted her I cou'd perceive her Countenance change but she hid her Confusion by wiping her Face with her Handkerchief I wou'd fain have follow'd her to have observ'd tho' at a Distance her Behaviour to the Woman but she took her into a back Parlour shutting the Door after her They were a pretty while together and when they parted I cou'd perceive a great deal of Discontent in the Countenance of my Motherinlaw When the Woman was gone I resolv'd to follow her and try if by any Stratagem I cou'd find my Mother's Resolutions I soon overtook her at which she seem'd something surpriz'd Good Woman said I I came after you to know whereabouts you dwell for your Fruit was so good as I ride out now and then I design to call upon you to buy some more  for tho' added I we have Fruit enough in our own Garden it is so narrowly watch'd by the Gardener according to my Mother's Directions that I can never get any That is reply'd the old Gobetween for fear you shou'd eat too much However if you have a mind to traffick that way with me I live in such a Place I am easy enough to be found every Child knows Goody Well then said I I'll come to see you tomorrow in the Afternoon Odso return'd the old Woman now I think on't I shan't be at home tomorrow but any other time you'll be sure to find me Why if you are not said I I suppose you have somebody at your House that can serve me No indeed han't I return'd the Woman I ask'd her so many Questions that tho' a Woman ignorant enough she began to smell a Rat and seem'd so very shy in her Answers afterwards that plainly inform'd me she was tir'd of my Company She at last told me she wou'd not sell me any Fruit if I came for it for fear it shou'd do me an Injury I try'd many Ways to bring her into Humour again but to no Purpose and I did not care to say any more for fear she shou'd be confirm'd in her Suspicions However I kept her so long in  Talk that a Man met us who I observ'd wanted to discourse the old Woman When he came up with us I cou'd perceive the old Woman wink at him and seem'd to exact from him a cautious Behaviour The Person seem'd to be in some Confusion however he call'd her by her Name and ask'd whose Child I was with a great many common Words of  Pretty Youth  and so forth but when she told him who I was his Countenance express'd the utmost Confusion He ask'd her in a hasty manner What Business I had with her I don't know said the old Woman Master wants to buy some Fruit of me and wou'd fain come tomorrow and I have told him I shan't be in the Way If that be all answer'd the Gentleman looking wistfully on the old Woman you may comply with the young Man for I suppose you will not be abroad all Day No said the old Woman only in the Afternoon Why said I 'tis only in the Morning that I can come out but you seem said I to the old Woman not very willing to part with what you deal in to me as perhaps doubting my Pay But to convince you I am sincere in what I say there's Money beforehand and I desire you will save me two Dozen of the  same I had of you today and I'll be with you by Seven a Clock in the Morning  She made several aukward Speeches in receiving my Money but I found the Sight of it pleas'd her very well and so we parted I had a strong Desire to know their Conference but I was oblig'd to be contented till the next Day I did not doubt of my Motherinlaw's going to the Place of Rendezvous but then I imagin'd she might go to pacify that  Burleigh  mention'd in the Note However I resolv'd with myself to keep it a Secret from my Uncle and use my utmost Endeavour to know something of their Conference the next Day  I arose next Morning without sleeping a Wink all Night my Thoughts were so confus'd and troublesome to me I got out before my Uncle or any of the Family were stirring except some of the Servants I directed my Steps towards the Town and met the old Woman before I had got half way I was somewhat surpriz'd because it was not much past Six which was an Hour before I promis'd to come So said I good Woman you are resolv'd to save me a Walk I see No Sir said she not for that but I have a fresh Parcel of Oranges come in last Night  and my Lady order'd me to bring some of the first I had Why good Woman said I she can't want any yet sure you brought her a sufficient Quantity Yesterday to serve her a great while even as long as they will last good I can't tell for that said she but as long as she order'd me to bring her some I'll e'en carry 'em But said I why did not you bring my Fruit at the same time Laud said the old Woman I protest I forgot it But I shall be back presently and then I'll gather 'em fresh for you for as yet I'll assure you they are growing I soon found by all this Hurry there was another Letter to be deliver'd and I was resolv'd to read it by fair means or otherwise Pray said I good Woman how do you sell your Ware a Dozen Why truly Sir said she Half a Crown Why then said I I'll give you the Money and make my Mother a Present of 'em  The Woman was struck dumb at what I said But at last she recover'd her Confusion and with a stammering Tongue told me she wou'd not do such a Thing for all the World Pray good Woman said I can you out of your Wisdom tell me what Reason you have for refusing me your Oranges  when I offer to pay you for 'em and carry 'em home myself without giving you any farther Trouble She cou'd not give me any reasonable Answer to my Question so I e'en resolv'd to declare to her my Knowledge of her Affair which when I had done she fell down upon her Knees and begg'd I wou'd forgive her telling me she wou'd never be guilty of the like again Good Woman said I the Way to make me excuse you and keep this a Secret tho' such a guilty Commerce is the greatest Crime is to deliver me your whole Affair and deal ingenuously with me I have given you convincing Proofs that I know your Proceedings hitherto and shall be able to judge whether you are sincere or no Why then truly Sir said she all I have done was merely out of Necessity Mr  Wigmore  you know has a very persuasive Tongue especially back'd with his Money Well good Woman said I go on for at present I have no Acquaintance with the Person you mention Really nor I neither but that he has come often to our House to meet my Lady and it was the same Person you saw with me Yesterday  I was too eager to ask many Questions therefore I bid her tell me what was her present Errant Nothing Sir but to carry a Letter in an Orange as I did Yesterday in the Afternoon Upon that I took out the Orange she told me it was in and read as follows  DEAR MADAM  THO' I was infinitely rejoic'd at your kind Letter Yesterday and the pleasing Hope of seeing you today yet I must beg of you for both our Safeties to defer my longing Expectations till we can find some more convenient Place of meeting That Villain  Burleigh  has been with me again and has by some means unknown to me discover'd our Meeting therefore let me once more intreat you to think of some other Place where we may feed our famish'd Joys The time will not permit you to send me any Answer by our Emissary who I believe is very faithful therefore I will wait in my usual Disguise at the usual Place but let me beg you by our past Enjoyments to fix by this Afternoon a secure Place where I may take to my Arms all that is valuable in this World to the expecting  WIGMORE  P S  I beg you for both our Quiets to stop the Mouth of the implacable  Burleigh    When I had read the Note I was well convinc'd my Mother was return'd to her former Vice but cou'd not determine which was the best Way either to send the Letter or keep it to shew my Father and Uncle to convince 'em of her Perfidy While I was reading the Epistle the Woman had time to come to herself and ask'd me how she shou'd behave in the Affair For said she if I go back Mr  Wigmore  will certainly discover me therefore if you will please to instruct me in what I shall say to him I will be sure to follow your Directions Well good Woman said I since you are so condescending I'll ask your Advice for I don't doubt however you express yourself in Words you have Cunning enough in your Business to advise me If you think so Sir said she you shall have my Counsel such as it is Hold then said I since it is so let me do as a Client shou'd do pay my Fee beforehand Upon saying this I gave her a Crown She was very much surpriz'd at it and view'd me from Head to Foot as if she had said she cou'd not imagine I was  Master of such a Sum When she had recover'd her Speech for old Women don't want Tongue long I find said she by your Fee you expect good Counsel therefore I wou'd advise you if you can counterfeit a Hand any thing like your Mother's to send him an Answer that shall forewarn him to come to her any more I fear said I good Woman we shall be found out for such an Answer will be too sudden for the kind Return she sent him Yesterday Why I think you are in the right there reply'd the old Woman and I believe it was kind enough for he kiss'd it several times when he first had it seeming greatly pleas'd and since you don't approve of my Advice I dare swear you can tell what to do without me Pr'ythee said I good Woman know you any thing of the Affair between my Motherinlaw and this  Wigmore  Your Sincerity in your Confession shall oblige me to find a Recompence Really reply'd the Woman I know nothing more than that they have met at my House about some Dozen times and I was so well paid that I must freely own I wish it had been oftner for indeed young Sir I am a very poor Woman and Money as I told you before carries a great deal of  Persuasion with it tho' I must needs own I wou'd much rather have gotten Money honestly But then again if I had not undertaken the Affair somebody else wou'd so I thought it was as much my Business as Well well Mistress I am not asking what was the Motive that induc'd you to it I am pretty well acquainted with it already But I wou'd know what Correspondence has been carry'd on between the Parties Indeed Sir I know no more than I have told you before that they meet at my House and have a private Room to themselves Mr  Wigmore  and your Mother both were Strangers to me a Twelvemonth ago and I know no more of Mr  Wigmore  now but that he comes to our Town almost every Day and they say he lives at a Lord's about ten Mile off but I have forgot his Name But Sir I wou'd not have you defer what you intend to do any longer for Mr  Wigmore  will think me long a coming and perhaps come to meet me as he has often done You advise well I return'd one Word more and I have done Have you no Knowledge of one  Burleigh  that is mention'd in this Note No really Sir said she but I know there has been a Man with Mr  Wigmore  and his Visits  have given him much Uneasiness but I don't know the Reason of it  I was convinc'd by the Woman's manner of speaking that she was sincere in what she said and as she knew nothing more I was resolv'd to ask her no more Questions but being fortunately provided with a Pencil and some Paper I wrote the following Words  Mr WIGMORE  I  HAVE at last repented of my Behaviour to a Husband that deserves the best of Wives therefore I beg you will do your endeavour to forget me it being the safety Conduct for us both I fear I am suspected already and the way to wipe off all manner of Suspicion is no more to be guilty Farewell and be happy  I read the Note to the old Woman who approv'd of it I had counterfeited my Mother's Hand so well that it cou'd hardly be distinguish'd especially being wrote with a Pencil And I order'd the Woman to tell Mr  Wigmore  that my Mother was in a Chamber where she had not the Conveniency of Pen and Ink The old Woman put it up in the room of the other giving me her Promise to be very faithful in her new Commission  I gave her Assurance of being well rewarded for her Pains and so we parted  As I was going home I began to consider what I had done and soon imagin'd this Affair of my Mother's cou'd not be long a Secret therefore I resolv'd within myself to take an Opportunity of disclosing it to her with a faithful Account of all the Proceedings as well as the Knowledge I had of her intended barbarous Design against me I did not know but this might deter her from her cruel Intentions But then I began to consider that in all my Readings I had learnt the Cruelty of a Woman was hard to be remov'd Therefore I determin'd to declare all to my Uncle and take his Advice upon't  When I came home the Family were at Breakfast which was something earlier than usual but I was soon acquainted with the Reason for my good Motherinlaw it seems did design to set out immediately to see a Friend that was dangerously Ill As this was no new thing so it alarm'd no one but me for the good Woman pretended to understand abundance of things and was a second  Lady Bountiful  This Practice I suppose she took up to blind the Eyes of my Father  and Family that they might not look too narrowly into her Actions When I was sat among 'em I was ask'd to drink Tea but I excus'd myself by telling 'em I had my Breakfast already and look'd my Mother full in the Face but she regarded me not having I suppose her Thoughts taken up concerning that Day's Business Pray said my Uncle have you broke your Fast with  Homer  or  Virgil  this Morning Neither Sir said I I have kept no other Company but  Juvenal  today And why so fond of  Satyr  Sir said my Uncle that favours of IllNature True Sir I return'd for I cannot think the Writings of either  Juvenal  or  Petronius  true Copies of those Times I cannot imagine either the Men or the Women such Monsters of Iniquity as those Authors represent 'em That reply'd my Uncle proceeds from the simple Innocence of thy own Thoughts But we have Instances every Day of the Inhumanity and all other vicious Principles of either Sex Are not the  SessionsPapers  frequently fill'd with barbarous and inhuman Murders Men of their Wives and Wives of their Husbands and Children But the crying Sin of Murder is oftner perpetrated by the Women  than the Men being their Passions are more violent and vindictive and once enter'd in the Road of Wickedness they generally travel to the End on't  I observ'd my Motherinlaw did not very well relish the Discourse therefore order'd her Pad to be ready What said my Uncle does my Sister go alone Sure it will not be improper for a Servant to wait on her No Sir reply'd my Mother I always visit my Patients alone for this Reason if I shou'd take a Servant with me they wou'd presume on the Benefit the Patient might hope to receive expecting some Reward which to avoid I never take one with me Beside I am so well known round me Country that I never met with any Insults from any one Nay said my Uncle smiling Innocence and Virtue are sufficient Guards and those I don't doubt but my Sister takes along with her She made him no Answer but immediately mounted and rode away As soon as she was gone I ran up to the Top of the House where was a Cupola that commanded a large Prospect I perceiv'd ere she had got a Quarter of a Mile from our House she met a Countryman who stop'd and discours'd together I had a Perspective in  my Study which I had brought up with me and I cou'd plainly perceive they were very earnest in Discourse for I cou'd distinguish their Countenances as plain as if they had not been forty Yards from me After talking some time I observ'd my Mother stoop down to kiss him first looking about if the Coast was clear then turn'd her Horse's Head in order to come home again as I thought Upon this I immediately went down to acquaint my Uncle with my Morning's Adventure but was inform'd that my Father and He were shut up together in his Closet As they had lock'd the Door I suppos'd they had no mind to be disturb'd therefore retir'd with a Mind in the utmost Confusion of Thought for I imagin'd with Probability enough that my Uncle was acquainting my Father with what I had inform'd him of my Motherinlaw  The Anxiety I felt for what I suppos'd wou'd follow when all was discover'd almost robb'd me of my Understanding I took several hasty Turns in the CourtYard without knowing where I was At last it occur'd to my Memory that I had seen my Motherinlaw turn her Horse's Head in order as I imagin'd to come Home but wonder'd  at her Delay for more time was past than was necessary for her Return at a moderate Pace After waiting and not seeing her I began to think she had alter'd her Resolution and proceeded on her intended wicked Journey While I was ruminating on this wretched Affair my Father and Uncle came to me My Uncle told me he had been depositing a Copy of his Will into my Father's Hands that if Death shou'd pay him a Visit unexpectedly and the Lawyer out of the way we might by having Recourse to that Copy know how far I was beholden to him  After some Talk I took an Opportunity to let my Uncle know I had something to communicate to him who was as forward to give me an Occasion of talking with him When we were disengag'd from my Father I acquainted my Uncle with what I had done Yesterday and this Morning and what Observations I had made on my Motherinlaw Certainly said my Uncle this Woman as far exceeds the lascivious Queen of  Naples  in Wickedness as she did the rest of her Sex What think you Sir said I if we take Horse and follow her It may be we may have the Fortune of finding the Bottom of  this Intrigue or at least from thence know how to form your Behaviour to her and my Father My Uncle lik'd my Advice so well that we immediately mounted our Horses without letting my Father know of our going Ere we had gone half a Mile the Horse my Uncle rode on which was one of my Father's fell a neighing and was answer'd by another in a neighbouring Thicket As we went forward the Horse seem'd willing to go that way Nay said my Uncle if you have such a Mind to go out of the Road I'll humour you for once it may be as we are KnightsErrant we may meet with some extraordinary Adventure Accordingly he gave the Horse the Reins and he readily enter'd the Copse The first thing our Eyes encounter'd was my Mother's Pad ty'd to a Tree and a little farther behind some Shrubs we discover'd my good Motherinlaw and a likely CountryFellow very familiar together You may guess their Surprize at the Sight of us and ours was almost as great But my Motherinlaw recover'd herself the soonest ran to Horse mounted without any Help and rode off On my Conscience said my Uncle the honest Countryman has put Vigour into her  Ladyship but I think it a Pity he shou'd go unrewarded and that he may be the fitter for running we'll make him something lighter  The Man found it was to no Purpose to attempt running away as he was on Foot therefore he approach'd us with a submissive Behaviour and beg'd our Pardon imagining we were Strangers to my Father and his Wife telling us he hop'd we wou'd not expose a Lady to an injur'd Husband's Resentment Sir said I I remember you now notwithstanding your Disguise and this is not the first time you have seen me Call to mind Yesterday look in my Face and then consider the Injury you have done my worthy Father and his Family I then inform'd my Uncle this was the Person that met me Yesterday conversing with the old Woman who was the LetterCarrier Then said the disguis'd Countryman I find all is discover'd But if you are Persons of Honour you will not oppress a naked Man I own my Guilt nay will confess the whole Progress of it if you will forgive me Do but keep it a Secret from the Husband and I farther vow never to be guilty that way again  I am a Gentleman of a good Family but fallen to Decay Necessity first drew me into this criminal Conversation with the Lady tho' I must own notwithstanding our Disparity of Years I have a tender Regard for her Youth do not always weigh their Actions and for want of Thought plunge into Crimes we are afterwards asham'd of Well young Man said my Uncle tho' you have injur'd a noble Family yet as you seem to repent of your past Folly and if you fulfill your Promise of revealing this black Correspondence I shall freely pardon you and desire never to see you more I thank you reply'd the Offender but I must farther beg you to mend your Promise by concealing this Affair from all the World Well said my Uncle notwithstanding this Woman's Wickedness which you are a Stranger to at least the worst Part of her vile Intentions I will with this young Gentleman's Consent pointing at me keep this a Secret till we have Reason to suspect she continues in her wicked Courses That's all I ask or can well desire said the Gentleman in Disguise and began as follows  I was born younger Brother to a numerous Issue and therefore design'd for a Tradesman  I was put Prentice to a Mercer in the City where I learnt little else but Idleness and Intriguing and wronging my Master by mispending his Time and Money You may perceive Gentlemen said he I intend to be sincere by revealing the Crimes of my first setting out in the World My FellowPrentices I believe had no more Honesty than myself tho' we were never privy to each others Secrets Before I had serv'd three Years of my Time my Master found his Business in a very declining Condition as indeed how cou'd it be otherwise when he had so many Harpies about him His Friends to do him Service had a Statute of Bankrupcy taken out against him which in a Year or two turn'd much to his Advantage for by that means he got rid of his Creditors and his Servants  He has since marry'd a good Fortune and drives a flourishing Trade My Relations press'd him to accept of me for the Remainder of my Time but he had too just an Opinion of me to comply with their Requests The Character I bore was the Obstacle that no one of the Trade wou'd entertain me and my Relations perceiving how Matters went thought it was to no Purpose  to think of the Counter for me therefore prevail'd upon a noble Lord to accept me for his Gentleman who out of Regard to my Family us'd me like one 'Tis needless to inform you of the many Intrigues I went thro' while I was a Retainer with this noble Peer but I shall proceed to the Affair with this Lady  The first time I saw her was at a neighbouring Gentlewoman's a Relation to our Family and a Lover of Intrigues Once every Week she had an Assembly where all the idle People of Fashion resorted to Game and make merry I observ'd she often cast a favourable Eye upon me tho' it was some time before I took any Notice of it But one Day losing a considerable Sum at  Quadrille  I was walking very melancholy alone in the Garden with troubled Thoughts how to get more I was interrupted in my Meditations by this Lady who after much Talk of indifferent Matters told me a young Gentleman without Money made but a dismal Figure Come come said she don't let's lose your Company for want of a little Trash Gamesters have various Fortune she may cast a more favourable Eye upon you at your next Trial therefore there's a  Hundred Pieces to tempt her I don't doubt but you will soon be in a Capacity to pay me  I was so overjoy'd at the Sight of the Money that I was too eager for Play to return her then the suitable Thanks for so great a Favour but immediately hurry'd among the Gamesters and in less than an Hour recover'd my own Money and a handsom Sum beside at  Basset  Immediately after the Company broke up Play and went to Supper My good Fortune had so much elevated me that I had no Stomach to eat for I believe Extremes either way for some time spoil the Appetite therefore I took a Walk in the Garden again in a far better Temper than when I was there before I had not walked long ere I perceiv'd the Lady in the same Walk but whether she had continu'd there or had come after me I cou'd not tell for my good Fortune had quite blinded me However I went up to her and thank'd her for the great Favour I had receiv'd and was fumbling for the Money to repay her Come said she I am not in such Haste we'll find a Time to be paid after Supper no doubt you'll try the fickle Dame again therefore keep it till I demand  it of you it's very possible I may soon stand in as much need of it as you did some time ago till then you shall be my Banker  I don't know how much farther we shou'd have proceeded if we had not been interrupted by some of the Company which she perceiving coming towards us gave me a gentle Press by the Fingers and left me It was not very difficult to guess she had a farther Meaning in leaving her Money in my Hands and I must own I was not displeas'd with the Thoughts of it for even her Person did not seem despicable to me so on that Score I shou'd not need much Constraint in my Compliance but the Pleasure of being paid for whatever Trouble I shou'd be at was the most prevailing Argument The next Assembly I was prevented in making one of the Company because my Lord took me out a Hunting The Morning following an old Woman brought me this Letter pulling one out of his Bosom which I took from him by my Uncle's Order See  Billy  said he if it be that ill Woman's Hand when I assur'd him it was I read the Contents as follows  SIR  I  SHOULD have been very well pleas'd if you cou'd have made one of the Company Yesterday for Fortune was so favourable to me to keep me in Countenance during the whole Evening I have another Sum to put into my Banker's Hands and if he will follow the Directions of the Bearer he may have full Possession of it this Evening  Yours  c  I was very well pleas'd with this Billet and took Instructions where to wait on the Lady When Evening came I went to the Place appointed where I found her waiting with some Impatience as she told me The old Woman left us alone and it was not long ere we came to a right Understanding which Acquaintance has continu'd upwards of four Years yet I must own to you her Conversation was always agreeable to me setting aside my Interest But Sir said I in one of your Letters you sent a Day or two ago you mention one  Burleigh  and that you fear'd some rash Proceedings from him Pray what do you know of him Really very little reply'd  Wigmore  But I am very much surpriz'd  that you know any thing of that Letter I never thought the old Woman wou'd have betray'd me No said I she has not betray'd you she was only overreach'd tho' now I believe she repents of her past Actions Why then said  Wigmore  the Hand of Heaven has pointed her out as a Mark for my Repentance which I will sincerely for all my past Follies Well Sir said my Uncle I am inclin'd to believe you But pray to make me stronger in that Faith deliver us what Letters you have of hers Upon my Honour I'll never put 'em to a wrong Use I shall confide in you reply'd Mr  Wigmore  and therefore put 'em into your Hands I carry 'em always about me that no Accident shou'd discover our Affair But I am convinc'd Heaven will not let such Actions be ever a Secret You may see added he how they follow'd one another because I have number'd 'em as I receiv'd 'em After my Uncle had given him some wholsome Advice relating to Conduct in Life we left him  Well said my Uncle now let's examine the Contents of these fine Epistles Come  Billy  your Eyes are younger than mine read 'em I then open'd  Numb  having read  Numb  before which was as follows  WHAT Words can express the Satisfaction I receiv'd at our last Conversation I am impatient till I see the Light of my Life again and if you wou'd not leave me for ever in Darkness come this Evening to the same Place to receive with the utmost Transports from One all that is in her Power to give who thinks it her only Happiness to call herself  Yours  c  Well said cry'd my Uncle the Woman was well pleas'd I find She writes pretty plain But what will not Women do when they abandon Modesty But come to the next Let's have some more of her Wit and Parts  NUMB III  MY dear Boy some hated FamilyBusiness will prevent my seeing the Darling of my Soul tomorrow but be assur'd the usual Time of the Day following shall bring me to your Arms where we will revel in Delight and laugh at my foolish credulous Husband who imagines when I come to see you I am visiting the Sick But the poor Man is very wicked  and I can think of no other way of sending him to Heaven but with the Assistance of my dear  Wigmore  I wou'd have you make our Gobetween  Goody  a Present of a Pair of Sheets for she complain'd to me heavily of the Want of 'em and tho' I believe she's very faithful to us yet now and then a small Trifle that way will not only keep her in Humour but make it her Interest to observe us Farewell and be happy tho' I shall not taste of it till I see those Eyes  Yours  c  O Woman Woman said my Uncle how ripe in Wickedness The most profligate of Man wou'd not have been openhearted so soon But come let's make an End with her as fast as we can for I have almost enough of her  NUMB IV  WHAT a despicable Creature is a Husband after the ardent Embraces of a Lover I thought nothing cou'd have added to the Aversion I had already conceiv'd for him but since I have known thee thou Charmer of my Soul I find that Aversion daily increase I yield to his fulsome Caresses as the Criminal receives  the parting Kiss of the Executioner and what's the greatest Torment I am oblig'd to fain a wanton Joy which you know is real But I must dissemble to all the World but my dear  Wigmore  and whatever I say or do to him comes from the warm Blood of my Heart I am sick of this Evil of a Husband but one Touch from you will Heal my Disease I only wish as we have shewn him the ready Road to Heaven he wou'd set out towards his Journey nay to make the more Haste I wou'd lend him a Hand to pull on his Boots But let's have a little Patience Time kills as well as cures Tomorrow I shall open my Heart to him that has the Soul of  J V  Sure said my Uncle this is the Quintessence of all ill Women put together But on  NUMB V  PITY my dear  Wigmore  the Grief of Mind I lie under But you may guess the Cause when I declare it is not in my Power to see you these ten Days except you can think of some Disguise for my Son  Johnny  is taken ill of the SmallPox I am oblig'd to attend him myself for he will not let any of the Family  give him the least Nourishment But if you can think of any Disguise and venture at the Back of our Garden near the Tree where I hide my Letters in the Dusk of the Evening tho' no Disguise can hide the dear  Wigmore  from me who will ever carry his Image in my Heart I'll find an Opportunity of seeing him in Reality who is always present to the Imagination of One who shall be ever  Yours  c  Pray said my Uncle is there no Date to these loving Epistles No Sir said I but we may guess pretty near the Time by my Brother's having the SmallPox which is near three Years ago Well on to the next said my Uncle  NUMB VI  I  THANK my Stars my Boy is past all Danger That and the Hopes of seeing my dear  Wigmore  again at a more convenient Place than our last made me comply with my Husband's Request of making one Bed serve us both But as I thought of you all Day I dreamt of you all Night When wish'd Morning came my Husband went out a Hunting and having an Opportunity with a Poetical Fancy in my Head I have put my Dream into as good Verse  as ever I cou'd but you must forgive bad Numbers since Love of you has made me a Poet  When balmy Sleep my Eyelids clos'd  And half the World their Cares repos'd  Your Image fill'd my fancy'd Breast  My eager Arms the Phantome prest  Wak'd with th'imaginary Bliss  I strove to give my Love a Kiss  But Death to Love and all Love's Charms  I found my Husband in my Arms  The nauseous Joy his Tongue exprest  Quite robb'd my gentle Heart of Rest  But yet to cover the Deceit  I was compell'd to aid the Cheat  And Kiss for Kiss return again  When nothing cou'd be greater Pain  For Bankrupts too to make Demands  Curse on the Priest that join'd our Hands  But all my Grief and all Annoy  At Sight of thee will turn to Joy  When you my dazled Eyes shall bless  All Sorrow turns to Happiness  Oh the Devil said my Uncle shall such a wicked Wretch as this Woman pretend to taste of the heavenly Drops of Poetry when all Hell is in her Soul It is the greatest  Profanation to the Muses Yet tho'  Clio  cannot tune her Lyre  Melpomene  presides over her black Soul together with  Alecto  and the rest of the  Furies  This Woman wou'd have been well pleas'd to have been a  Samorin  Wife  The Country of the  Samorins  reaches along the SeaCoast of the  EastIndies  from  Ticori  to  Chitwa  It is the Custom of that Country for the Women to have twelve Husbands if they think fit yet they all agree very well taking their Turns to cohabit with the Wife The Husband whose Turn it is leaves his Arms at the Door of the Wife's Chamber which must not be remov'd on Pain of Death When the Wife is with Child she names the Husband who is to father it and he is to take care of its Education but those Children do never inherit their Father's Estate that descends to the Male Issue of the Father's Sister but if she have no Issue the Estate comes to the nearest Relation of the Father's Grandmother  But I hope continu'd my Uncle there is not many more Yes Sir said I there's Five more and I find by the Numbers there's some wanting for the next is  Numb  Those reply'd my Uncle no doubt contain'd something too dangerous to be kept As we were preparing to read the next Letter we cou'd perceive running towards us the Person they were sent to We were something surpriz'd at his Return but when he came up to us for we stood still to  read the Letters he told us almost out of Breath with running that  Burleigh  was coming the same way and no doubt for no good for I know he has been disappointed by my Lady concerning the receiving of Money which Disappointment has so much exasperated him that he resolves to ruin my Lady tho' I know not by what Means We perceived a Man about a Quarter of a Mile behind us bending his Course towards our House the FootWay My Uncle ask'd what was best to be done Why Sir said Mr  Wigmore  if you will give me Leave to advise you I wou'd have you prevent his getting to my Lady's if possible for this Time who knows what may follow I intend if you approve of it to write to my Lady which Letter if you please you shall see first wherein I will declare all Correspondence for the future shall be intirely broke off between us and to convince her I am sincere in what I write to crush all her Hopes at once in a few Days I intend to embark for  Virginia  where I have some Relations in Power that I am assur'd will provide for me Do so said my Uncle But how shall we see this Letter Why return'd Mr  Wigmore  I'll be walking before the CourtGate  under the great Trees three Hours hence My Disguise will prevent my being known by any one but you two Gentlemen or my Lady and if I can meet with my Lady I shou'd be pleas'd to deliver the Letter to her myself Well said my Uncle let it be so But  Will  tells me there's some Letters missing as you have number'd 'em Pray what might they contain if it is not improper to know Really reply'd Mr  Wigmore  I can't very well remember the Contents but in gross they were something too free for a Woman's Pen I believe said my Uncle if the Story of the  Norman  Monk was true  Richard  sirnam'd the  Religious  Grandson to  Rollo  Duke of  Normandy  was esteem'd a Prince of singular Piety Among many  Monkish  Stories of him the following one seems to be calculated for those of large Faith  A Monk of  Normandy  given more to the Flesh than the Spirit us'd to visit his Mistress by Night for more Secrecy One very dark Evening going to the Rendezvous his Way lying over a Bridge he fell in and was drown'd When his Soul was descended into the Regions of the Dead an Angel of Light and another of Darkness had many Strugglings about it but not agreeing they resolv'd to put it to the Decision of the pious Duke  Richard  The Angels pleaded like themselves before their Judge who wisely weighing the Matter gave Sentence the Body shou'd have its Soul again and plac'd near the Bridge where he fell from if he fell in the black Gentleman shou'd take him for his Perquisite The Sentence being put in Execution the Priest had learnt more Wit return'd to his Convent and there defy'd the Devil and all his Works This Affair was so quick in the Dispatch that Duke  Richard  going to the Convent to see what was become of the Monk found his Habit all wet with his Fall into the River  and this Woman was in his Condition  it wou'd not be hard to guess which Angel wou'd have the Guardianship of her Ladyship Come Sir said Mr  Wigmore  may be Heaven intends all for the best I hope so too reply'd my Uncle but I fear without a Miracle she'll go the other Way for all that However I'll wait patiently tho' with little Hope more for the Peace and Quiet of my Brother and his Family than any good Will to such a wicked Woman  I fear Sir said I you will not have Time enough for Reflexion now for  Burleigh  walks at a very great Rate therefore the sooner we think how to prevent his getting to the House the better Od so said my Uncle that's true then let us be gone and leave Mr  Wigmore  to think of his Epistle  The HorseRoad to our House was even with the FootRoad 'till within a Furlong of the Gate and then there was no other Way but the common Road We kept just before  Burleigh  all the way and as he came over the last Style he stumbled and fell on his Face Why how now honest Friend said my Uncle you seem so much in haste that you don't regard your Way Take care Remember the old Saying  The more Haste the worse Speed  which has indeed no other Meaning than when People go about things unlawful they shou'd not succeed If you were a  Roman  now you shou'd take that for an ill Omen Why reply'd  Burleigh  something surlily what Matter is it to you or any body else whether I am a  Roman  or a  Protestant  a  Dissenter  or a  Muggletonian  an  Anabaptist  or a  Quaker  or Hold hold cry'd my Uncle smiling at his Absurdity you seem to be pretty perfect in the Names of many Opinions and yet I fancy you are a mere Stranger to the Tenets of any of 'em I am well skill'd in  Physiognomy  and to assure you that I am you are now going about a black Work that let it go which way it will must of mere Necessity bring you into extreme Danger and Trouble  Why the Devil's in the Gentleman reply'd  Burleigh  with a lessassur'd Tone than at first or if the Devil is not in you you must be the Devil himself or at least a Conjuror Good Friend return'd my Uncle I am neither the Devil nor a Conjuror and yet I can tell and foretell and farther I assure you looking him full in the Face which put the other out of Countenance if you proceed in this Business you'll be in some Danger of a Halter Examine your Conscience You know if what I say be true or no Return from whence you came And for the future amend your Life and know me for your Friend  Amend your Life and know me for your Friend  cry'd  Burleigh  muttering sure I am asleep and all this is a Dream He stood some time gazing at my Uncle and then at me Pray Sir said he after a Pause who the Devil are you and what Business have you with me I am going about my Affairs and shan't stay any longer losing my Time Upon saying this he was pressing on But my Uncle cross'd him with his Horse and calling him by his Name with a menacing Tone told him he shou'd severely repent it if he mov'd a Step farther towards that House pointing at my Father's neither is the Lady  whom you go to seek at home she's gone to visit a sick Person Return three Days hence and it may be you will meet with better Success than you expect Whether my Uncle's stern Looks frighted him or that he really thought him the Devil I can't tell but at those last Words he went back again over the Style turn'd to give us another Look and ran back the Way he came as fast as his Legs cou'd carry him  There is more said my Uncle in a guilty Conscience than a Brace of Evidences 'Tis not impossible but this is the sure Means of your Mother's getting rid of this troublesome Retainer so I suppose there will be an annual Pension sav'd But what shall we do with this Woman If she has any Grace left the best way of shewing it will be to hang herself out of the way for I must own I cannot find any other Method to give Peace to the Family If we shou'd conceal these horrible Crimes in Hopes of her Amendment and she shou'd commit more we are in some sort accessary But Heaven guide us for the best We must proceed as Things occurr When the Groom had taken our Horses my Uncle ask'd him if he knew where his Master was He answer'd that he rid out presently after us being  inform'd we were taking the Air and that he took the same Road as we had done Sure said my Uncle softly to me Providence by its secret Workings intends to reclaim this Woman or by its mysterious Darkness will have her stumble into more Wickedness for my Brother's missing us must be almost a Miracle Pr'ythee let's go into the SummerHouse and think on these wretched Accidents over again  As we went thro' the Hall I saw  Betty  at work and letting my Uncle go before I inform'd her in brief of the Day's Affair She seem'd quite dead with my Relation For God's sake said she if you have any Value for your own Life get out of her Power for if she can be so wicked to do as you say I fear she'll arrive at the same Pitch she was at before I must own continu'd she my own Life is but of small Value and I wou'd freely part with it to atone for my past Crimes if it cou'd save my dear Master's but methinks I wou'd not have it made a Sacrifice to a revengeful Woman who will be sure to rid her Hands of me because she remembers I know her former wicked Intention  Well  Betty  said I rest contented you are provided for if you can like my Uncle's Service  for I have prevail'd upon him to accept you for his Housekeeper therefore whenever you think fit you may leave my Lady and be receiv'd there without any other Recommendation She was very much rejoic'd at the agreeable News telling me such good Fortune was far beyond her Hopes yet nothing she told me cou'd make her easy till I was entirely out of my Motherinlaw's Reach Well  Betty  I return'd I hope every thing will be determin'd in a few Days and so follow'd my Uncle  When I came into the SummerHouse to him he ask'd me why I staid When I inform'd him he did not seem pleas'd It had not been much matter said he  Billy  whether  Betty  had been let into the Secret so soon but however it can't be help'd I must own she knows enough already to be trusted with every thing We canvass'd the Matter over several times but cou'd make very little of it and before we cou'd come to any Resolution  Betty  interrupted us by bringing a Letter directed to my Uncle which she said the Messenger that brought it told her it required no Answer Pr'ythee  Billy  said my Uncle read it for I have no Secrets shall be hid from you As soon as I had cast my Eyes on the  Directions    I told him it was my Motherinlaw's Hand Odso said he this is an Honour indeed for I never was favour'd so far before But let us hear what her Ladyship can say for herself May be it's a Letter of leave to dispose of her sweet Person or rather now I think on't to be careful of her dear  Wigmore  But read it that we may be acquainted with her Commands  SIR  WHAT shall I say to gain Credit that what I write to you is sincere If the ripping out my false Heart wou'd do it it shou'd be done this Moment What you have guided by Fate seen today I must confess is not my only Crime But whatever I have been guilty of shall be remember'd only with a sincere Repentance Do not imbitter our Lives by discovering to my too indulgent Husband the Faults of his wicked Wife If you knew with what Horror my Soul is fill'd not for the Fear of Punishment but for what my unthinking Heart has dene even you wou'd pity me Consider the rarer Virtue is in Forgiveness 'tis that which distinguishes us from Brutes Do you stand in the Place of my Husband think no more of what's past and upon the Assurance of a hearty Repentance  I will never have a Thought of my former Guilt but to bewail my Fall from Virtue Tho' you are no great Admirer of the Female Sex I am assur'd you have Humanity I shall expect no Answer but come home in the Evening as usual where if I find all discover'd I shan't in my Heart blame you but I will to get rid of my Shame put an End to the Life of  Your affectionate Sister J V  That Word  Affectionate  at last said my Uncle puts me out of Conceit with all the rest However we'll comply and beg the Hand of Heaven to guide us While we were debating my Father came in I thought said he you were both run away you disappear'd so suddenly Pray which way went you And how was it possible for me to miss you We only rid into the Copse after a Hare reply'd my Uncle that a Countryman inform'd us he saw there but the Greyhound lost her  We took several Turns in the Garden and I cou'd not look upon my Father without the Tears coming into my Eyes How different  thought I is this Woman from  my  dear Mother And how unhappy has a second Marriage made the Family My Father took Notice of my Melancholy asking if I was out of Order But my Uncle made him an Answer for the Question came so much unlook'd for that I cou'd not tell what to say  Billy  said he I believe is out of Humour because I hinder'd his going to pore over his Books for he thinks every Hour lost out of such Company I made him no Answer which confirm'd what my Uncle said I hope  Billy  return'd my Father has read enough not to take any thing Ill his Uncle says My Uncle finding he cou'd not make me dissipate that Discontent that sat on my Countenance turn'd the Discourse and by that brought me out of my Confusion Our uneasy Conversation was broke by the Ringing of the Bell for Dinner where I was forc'd to eat against my Stomach for fear my Father shou'd take more Notice of me  When we had din'd my Father went to take a Nap as usual which gave my Uncle and me an Opportunity of waiting without Observation for Mr  Wigmore  with his Letter About Three in the Afternoon we saw him approach us in the same Disguise he had on  in the Morning We went out to meet him that we might not be observ'd by the Servants of the House When he was within hearing my Uncle bid him turn back and we wou'd follow to the Copse  When we came there said Mr  Wigmore  This Place strengthens the Memory of my Crimes I have already repented of and shall to my dying Breath Here Sir is the Letter I promis'd in the Morning and whatever Fault you find with it I'll do my Endeavour to mend it My Uncle took the Letter and gave it me to read which was as follows  MADAM  IF my Life wou'd call back past Years I wou'd freely render it for that Satisfaction to die an Innocent Heaven sees our Guilt and if we do not repent I fear will severely punish us All the Hours I have to come I shall remember our past Crimes with Horror and I do not in the least doubt but you will do so too when you reflect what it is to defile the MarriageBed even with a Thought Do not imagine Fear obliges me to write to you in this manner No it is the Result of my Thoughts from an unquiet Conscience I do not say it is easy for  me to part with you for ever therefore as I am assur'd our guilty Commerce ought to have an End I intend tomorrow to imbark for another Climate where I shall have Leisure to reflect on my past Follies those I confess are very numerous But my Capital Sin was my Tenderness for you and that I fear will press in sometimes in a manner not pleasing to virtuous Men which Character for the future Heaven assist me to maintain So wishing you an eternal Farewell I beg you to think on the Advice of your sincere Friend in Virtue  T WIGMORE  Well said my Uncle as there is I hope Truth in it there's no Want of Rhetoric But how must this be deliver'd to the good Gentlewoman now It will not be at all proper for either my Nephew or me to have a Hand in't for that may raise Suspicions Suppose reply'd Mr  Wigmore  we shou'd give it Mrs  Betty  With all my Heart said my Uncle if  Billy  approves on't I must own I reply'd that is the safest Method we can take but as the Case stands  Betty  must know the Contents or she will not deliver it We agreed it shou'd be so and took our Leaves of Mr  Wigmore  with Thoughts of  never seeing him more I must confess I cou'd not look upon him without the utmost Horror tho' his Guilt was not near of so black a Dye as my Motherinlaw's And I had such a Conflict between Reason and Rage that I had often Thoughts young as I was to call him to a more strict Account but the Hopes of his going abroad laid asleep my Resentment I thought I made but an odd Figure in tamely listening to these Interviews and told my Uncle afterwards what I had suffer'd 'Tis well Boy said he smiling he that conquers his Passions overcomes his greatest Enemy Even  Scipio  cou'd do no more  When we came home we were told my Father was still asleep I therefore went to find out  Betty  to give her the Letter and proper Instructions first acquainting her with the Contents This  Betty  may work upon her I pray Heaven it may says  Betty  for if she still continues her ill Life there's no farther Hopes we must discover all to your Father to prevent her Ill Designs for the future While I was talking with  Betty  my Uncle came to us and in a merry manner told her he shou'd soon have Occasion for her nay he wou'd be sure to manage it  that her Mistress shou'd give her Consent But said my Uncle I think I ought to limit your Power for my last Lady had something too much However I'll take your Word and  William  's Bond for the Performance of Articles But to think of more serious Matters continu'd my Uncle I wish my Brother cou'd be got out of the way when his good Lady arrives that we may have a little more Freedom of Conversation for I am not yet fully determin'd what to do with her Sir said I I know the ready way to send him abroad only tell him in such a Place is a Covy of Partridges and he and his Man will soon leave us neither is it a Falshood for the other Morning as I was going to meet the old Woman a Covy sprung up almost under my Feet Be it so then said my Uncle and here he comes get him out of the way as fast as you can I then went to my Father and inform'd him of what I knew who immediately call'd for his Man his Dog and his Gun and out he went first asking us if we wou'd accompany him but my Uncle excus'd himself and me too  He had not been gone above half a Hour but my Motherinlaw came in with a Countenance full of penitential Sorrow As soon  as ever she had an Opportunity she fell at my Uncle's Feet and with her Face sprinkled with Tears and a broken Voice interrupted with Sighs spoke to my Uncle after this manner  How shall I look up or what shall I do to gain Credit for what I am going to say It is but justice to suspect the Sincerity of my Words after what your Eyes have seen But be assur'd from this Day I will take my Date of Virtue While I have Life never will I wrong my worthy Husband even with a Thought What a gaping Ruin have I avoided if you will be prevail'd upon by Repentance to believe me And to gain more Credit from you I am oblig'd to let you know that even  Adultery  is not my greatest Sin I have since you saw me last weigh'd well my past Crimes and think there is not such another wicked Woman breathing But Heaven I hope has in its infinite Stock of Mercy Forgiveness in store for a sincere Repentance If my Words cannot gain Credit let your Sword blot out with my Blood my former Wickedness I know I have deserv'd Death and shall with Satisfaction resign my self to your Punishment if you can conceal my Crimes you may term it Accident or  whatever you think fit for I am even weary of this World made burdensome to me by the Weight of Sin I have laid upon myself and wou'd freely make an End of this wretched Being with my own Hands but that I consider I shou'd commit a Crime never to be repented of and take away all Hopes of Salvation even in the very Act Tho' I doubt not but Sorrow in a few Days will end my Crimes with my Life and the sooner that Day comes the sooner I shall be rid of a terrible Load of Reflexion even worse than Death itself Here Tears choak'd her Words and she sunk to the Ground quite overwhelm'd with Sorrow  Well Madam said my Uncle raising her if all this Grief is not real you are an excellent Counterfeit But I am willing to believe you sincere in your Confession And for my own Part I'll strive to forget all that's past or think of it as a Dream But you must pardon me if I am more careful for the future in observing your Actions for if you shou'd make an ill Use of my Credulity I shou'd in some sort be guilty Sir said my Motherinlaw Words are too poor to speak my Thanks but you shall find my Sincerity by my Actions If in the least of all  my future ones you find me erring I shall expect no Admonition from you but to be deliver'd up to the Hands of Justice And that you may have it in your Power to call me to an Account when you please I shall succinctly tell you which way I deserve the worst of Deaths She then related what you have read already concerning her first Husband's Death but solemnly protested the Poison was given him by Mistake for tho' she procur'd it for that Intent yet she had repented of her wicked Design and it being put into the Closet by Mistake among some Cordials the Nurse gave it her Husband as such for she was so far from believing that he came by his Death thro' her Means that she accus'd the Apothecary's Man and had follow'd the Accusation if she had not found out the Mistake I must own I had a guilty Commerce with the Apothecary who left off making his Visits after my Husband's unfortunate End This Proceeding exasperated me so far that I often wish'd his Death and the Devil to back my Wishes brought me acquainted with one  Burleigh  who us'd to work in the Gardens as Helper to the Gardener tho' otherwise a Trooper He undertook the black Deed and the Day he first knew my Mind  he put me past the Power to recall it by making an End of the unfortunate Man for even as soon as I parted with him I repented of the Crime and tho' I sought him all the Day after to prevent the Deed I never set Eyes on him till he came to tell me my Commands were obey'd The Concern I felt at the wicked News cou'd hardly be express'd by Words but the Wretch taking hold of my Weakness made me comply with every thing he desir'd and even to this Day compels me to maintain him  All the while she was relating her horrid Deeds my Uncle seem'd perfectly Thunderstruck Who wou'd think said he one Woman cou'd be so wicked Sir said she that is not all Then she proceeded to tell us of her Designs against me but that said she I have long since repented of as my worst of Crimes  Well said my Uncle I hope by this Confession we shall find your future Sincerity But what do you propose to do with this  Burleigh  It was with some Difficulty I prevented his coming here today Tho' I am amaz'd to find you know any thing of him said my Motherinlaw yet I shou'd be much oblig'd to you for your Advice in this Affair  Well said my Uncle in Hopes of future Amendment I have it in my Head to get rid of him which shall be done tomorrow if you'll let me know where to find him This Sir said she will double all my Obligations to you I'll give you a Direction in Writing While she was writing the Direction  Betty  brought her Mr  Wigmore  's Letter which she took and read Well said she I take Heaven to have a Hand in my Conversion for here's another Convert which very much pleases me because I was troubled before how to make an End with him She then related what had past between 'em And all her Relations agreed so well with what we knew before that we thought it a Crime in us not to believe her Promises for her future Behaviour  A little while after Word was brought us my Father was come home How said my Motherinlaw shall I look upon that dear injur'd Face without betraying my Guilt When I was envelop'd in Sin without Thought of Repentance I cou'd form my Behaviour as I thought fit without any Difficulty but now I cannot tell how to appear before him without the utmost Confusion Pray said my Uncle let this be the last Act of Dissembling  and hide from him the Combat in your Mind Time will bring you to the Tranquillity of Virtue again  When my Father came to us he seem'd very much pleas'd with his Diversion What said he you must be idling at home while I am oblig'd to go abroad to procure you a Supper Well I have got every Man his Bird 'Tis your Duty reply'd my Uncle to provide for your Family tho'  Billy  and I are at present Interlopers Heyday cry'd my Father What's the matter with  Jane  meaning his Wife are your Patients got well upon your Hands my Dear that you have not an Opportunity of shewing your Art you look so melancholy I am not very well my Dear reply'd my Mother in some Confusion I am sorry for that return'd my Father But as you can cure other People I hope you know what's good for yourself Yes Sir said she I have been troubled with it a great while 'tis a Heaviness of Heart but I have taken that I hope will cure it A Heaviness of Heart reply'd my Father there's nothing cures that Distemper like a Glass or two of good Wine nay I think it a general Cure for all Diseases and the sooner you take the Remedy the sooner you'll get rid of your  Malady I think said my Uncle that  Physic  is good for us all therefore let's have it While the Wine was gone for my Father seem'd to caress his Wife which occasion'd her bursting into Tears Pray said he my Dear tell me what is it disturbs you In Truth Sir said she I am not very well and beg leave I may go to Bed perhaps Rest may help me So saying she took leave of the Company and retir'd When my Father had drank a Glass of Wine he follow'd her to know how she did and left my Uncle and me together  Well  Billy  said he what think you of Affairs Do you believe she is sincere in her Protestations Yes really Sir said I if she does continue it I am confounded return'd my Uncle at what I have heard If she shou'd be as good as her Word and let murdering Sorrow make an End of her I must confess I shou'd be very easy notwithstanding her Penitence However we must find out  Burleigh  tomorrow and get rid of him And tho' I am assur'd he deserves an Halter yet I'll give him a few Pieces to send him into another Part of the World with all my Heart and then sure she will be easy I am of your Opinion Sir said I I fansy her Decline of  Years will prevent her seeking another Lover I do not know that reply'd my Uncle that itching Folly never considers Years however I believe we have nothing to fear from her but if we shou'd be deceiv'd I shou'd never forgive myself I must own 'tis but seldom Virtue succeeds Vice yet such things have been and therefore may happen again We have all the Prospect we can desire in the Confession of her Guilt for as she was ignorant of our Knowledge of it she might have spar'd the Relation if she had not intended for the future to amend her Life We had much Discourse concerning her till interrupted by my Father who told us his Wife seem'd very much indispos'd but he hop'd Rest wou'd restore her For my own Part I freely declare her Death wou'd certainly have griev'd me but the Content I shou'd have found from the Family's being intirely out of her Power wou'd have soon wip'd away my Tears  After Supper I inform'd  Betty  of all Passages whose Hopes and Fears agreed with mine tho' our Hopes by far overbalanc'd our Fears  In the Morning my Uncle told my Father that he and I had a Visit to make and  very possibly might be oblig'd to stay Dinner Accordingly we took Horse but in order to find out  Burleigh  who liv'd in an obscure Village three Miles from my Father's When we arriv'd we cou'd perceive him running out of the BackDoor at the first Sight of us and I believe wou'd have got away from us if his Overhaste had not often made him fall in the Stubble When we overtook him my Uncle ask'd him why he made such Haste from his best Friends Why to tell you the Truth Sir said he I don't care for conversing with the Devil for I can hardly take you for any thing else Why said my Uncle were you not afraid of conversing with him when you made away with Mr the Apothecary for Murder is always instigated by the Devil At these Words the Fellow fell a trembling and cry'd out  I am a dead Man  No said my Uncle tho' Murder shou'd never be forgiven and tho' I am no Devil yet I have sufficient Reasons to assist you in making your Escape for if you stay Four and Twenty Hours Justice will lay hold on you and there will be no other Road to get away but that of the Gallows In short such a Person naming my Motherinlaw has discover'd it Now I wou'd save  both your Lives which cannot be done without you fly immediately Alas Sir said  Burleigh  whither shou'd I fly I have no Money or Friends or I wou'd be gone with all my Heart For that said my Uncle I'll take care Go and provide yourself with what Necessaries you have and then follow me We were not long before we mounted and pursu'd our Journey toward  Bristol    As we rid along my Uncle ask'd him how he cou'd be so inhuman to murder a Man in cold Blood and one very probable almost a Stranger to him Why indeed reply'd  Burleigh  I had but little Knowledge of him but as to murdering him I can't give it that Name for I fairly fought with him tho' indeed that can't be proved because I am only my own Witness What d'ye mean by fighting fairly cry'd my Uncle is taking a Man's Life without any Provocation to be call'd fair I can't directly argue the Point with you Sir return'd  Burleigh  but when a Person has equal Arms to his Opposer and the other fairly runs the risk of Death I say it can't be call'd Murder for he always rode with a Pair of Pistols as I did the same and I gave him fair Warning told him either he or I had breath'd our last Hour 'Tis  true he was not very willing to fight but he found it was to no purpose and I must own if he had not I must of Necessity have kill'd him but he fir'd both his Pistols and miss'd me and I with one of mine shot him thro' the Throat After he fell from his Horse I drag'd him into the neighbouring unfrequented Wood ty'd his Horse to a Tree in the same Wood and rid home with my own The same Day I got leave to be absent a few Days return'd to the Wood took the Horse I had left there and sold him at  Chester  with a Pretence I was bound for  Ireland  so return'd home on Foot I must own I was too hasty in executing my Lady's Desire for she never peremptorily bid me but I was willing to get him out of the way that I might have her all to my self I continu'd my Correspondence for three or four Years and constantly receiv'd an annual Pension But when she was about marrying she gave me three Years Allowance together telling me at the same time that what I then receiv'd was the utmost she cou'd do for me And indeed gave me good Advice But my Money was soon gone therefore I apply'd myself to her again and almost forc'd a Subsistence from  her by threatning to declare what she has now done herself like a silly Woman as she is I must own I often threaten'd a young Gentleman who I am assur'd keeps Company with her of declaring something might endanger her Life but I can assure you it was only to fright some Money out of her  This Talk had brought us to the Town's End We went directly to my Uncle's Friend and by good Fortune found him at home My Uncle in private declar'd to him the Cause of this unexpected Visit and the Bargain was soon struck for the Disposal of my Friend  Burleigh  My Uncle at parting gave him Twenty Guineas for his own Use but with a strict Charge to his Friend not to trust him out of his Sight And in three Days after we were inform'd by Letter that the Ship set sail on her Voyage to  New York    Now said my Uncle I hope we have laid an excellent Plan for raising your Mother's Virtue and I hope the Superstructure will answer the Basis I am in Heart convinc'd of it I reply'd And indeed my Thoughts were now intirely bent on my lovely  Isabella  and the Contemplation of her Perfections produc'd a careful Musing which my Uncle  took notice of Why how now  William  said my Uncle What are those wise Thoughts that have ty'd your Tongue up I hope all Affairs at home are accommodated Come let me know the Reason of your Rumination Sir said I my Mind was fixt upon the Company we left behind us in your Neighbourhood I hope reply'd my Uncle the fair  Isabella  is not stealing into your Heart No Sir I return'd I have kept her Image there from the first Moment I saw her Face never to be defac'd by Years or Misfortune Why how now Youth cry'd my Uncle is your Heart susceptible of Love so soon But I thought as much by your Uneasiness to leave 'em at our last Visit But come we'll make 'em another tomorrow for I must own I long to be at home too Indeed Sir said I I freely confess there lies my Loadstone and turn which way I will my Inclinations look that way  Well said my Uncle I must own I am not against your embarking on the Sea of Love if I was sure you cou'd arrive at your desired Port without meeting with Storms in your Voyage Have you had any Talk with your fair Mistress Sir said I I will never conceal any thing from you and therefore I  shall declare all my Proceedings I then told him the whole Progress of my amorous Affairs Well return'd my Uncle I don't find you have any great Reason to despair Neither Sir said I can I find any thing to beget a Hope especially when I think of the implacable Aversion rooted in the Minds of the Mother and the Aunt against Men and Matrimony Indeed said my Uncle they have both sufficient Reasons for that Aversion the one from the complicated Humours of an illnatur'd Husband and the other from the Illusage of a Man unworthy the Name which to beguile the Time I will relate I mean the Story of the Aunt which I learnt from her own Mouth but the last time we were there  When she had scarce seen Seventeen she was courted by a Person remarkable for his good Make and Address with the Addition of a large Fortune which in many People serve only as instrumental to evil Actions This Man of the World by the common Wiles gain'd the Heart of the young Lady and by his subtle Insinuations prevail'd upon her to steal from her Relations His Pretence for it was his Friends Aversion to the Match for indeed his Estate might have commanded  as the World goes a more ample Dowry with a Wife Blinded by Love and his Hypocrisy she comply'd with his Desire and stole away from her Father When he had got her Person in his Custody he endeavour'd to gain his Ends without giving the Priest any Trouble but the Lady tho' much in Love abhorr'd his base Intentions and by her Resentment shew'd the Spark had nothing to hope for from that ungenerous Way He then got into her good Graces again by declaring his Attempt was only to try her letting her know at the same time how happy he shou'd be with a Woman of such an impregnable Virtue In a few Days after this Trial he marry'd her and in a Month after the Wedding told her he wou'd have her go home to her Friends for he expected his Wife out of the Country who was of such a violent Temper every thing was to be fear'd from her Rage  The poor Lady was dumb thro' Astonishment and many times fancy'd he had a mind to try her Temper and gave him to understand as much Well Madam said the base Wretch I am resolv'd to make the Matter as plain as I can to you Here  John  calling to one of his Servants this Madam  said he is the good Man that gave us a Commission to go to Bed together and he is come to take his Leave of you being to attend a Gentleman of my Acquaintance in his Travels in the Quality of his Footman and I believe he is so far from being a Churchman that he never was in a Church in his Life I hope said the Fellow your Honour will pardon my contradicting you in that for I have been many a Day in Twenty one after another The poor Lady too soon found the Truth of her Misfortune and her Rage and Despair vented in the bitterest Reproaches had no Effeft on the inhumane Brute But instead of giving her any Comfort finding she made no Haste in leaving him left her in sole Possession of the Lodging he had taken for that Purpose where she was forc'd to part with every thing she had of Value to support her in common Necessaries of Life and if her careful Father had not found her out was resolv'd to part with Life to put an End to her Shame and Misfortunes The old Gentleman took her home and to comfort her gave her his Word he wou'd forget her Unhappiness being well assur'd of her honest Intentions And this is the Cause of the Aunt's Aversion to Men and Matrimony  I shall own Sir said I I can't well blame the Resolution she has taken I must declare I wonder how such barbarous Notions can enter the Minds of Men and if there were not Instances of it every Day I shou'd think such Relations Fables How is it possible that the Nature of Men shou'd be so very different Every kind of the Brute Creation are much the same but Man sympathizes with every Degree of 'em and are full as various A Man had better not be than to be born with such Appetites and the Dignity of his Figure only makes him the greater Monster I own reply'd my Uncle your good Sense at so early an Age gives me the utmost Contentment and tho' Philosophy may be learnt without practising yet I believe I have nothing to fear from your Conduct  It was late in the Evening before we came home and we were inform'd by my Father that his Wife's Indisposition increa'd My Father seem'd so very much concern'd that he was not very inquisitive about the Journey we had made that Day We sympathiz'd with him However my Uncle inform'd him that we intended to be gone in the Morning early and all his Intreaties cou'd not prevail upon him to stay longer Well then  said my Father since you will go I wou'd have you take Leave of my Wife tonight which was agreed to A Message was sent to her to know if it was proper to see us and she sent Word she shou'd take it kindly When we came into the Room my Uncle and I sat on each side her Bed and neither of us spoke for some Moments At last my Motherinlaw broke Silence Well Sir said she to my Uncle has your Journey succeeded and am I to number this Day's Work among the many other Obligations I have to your Virtue Madam reply'd my Uncle every thing has fell out I hope according to your Desire for I am fully persuaded  Burleigh  will never come more to interrupt your growing Quiet He then related the Transactions of the Day to her Well then said my Mother my Mind's at rest and I hope Heaven will pardon me as you have done 'tis all I have now to do to gain it for I find I am not long to continue in this World for the Wounds my Virtue tho' a Conqueror has receiv'd in the sharp Combat with overgrown Vice I find will not be heal'd but by the Hand of Death therefore when you hear I am no more bury my Failings with my Body in my Grave nor never  think of me but as a sincere and humble Penitent  The Behaviour of my Motherinlaw brought Tears into my Eyes which she observ'd with a Tenderness I had never perceiv'd in her before Dry thy Tears my Child said she thy soft Disposition overwhelms me with Confusion If I survive I beg you will look upon me as thy own Mother for my Actions shall ever declare me so And if Death releases me from this troublesome World remember me as such in every thing but thy Grief I cou'd not return any Answer my Heart was so overburden'd with Sorrow which she perceiving flung her Arms about my Neck prest me to her Cheeks and we mingled our Tears together We continu'd in this sorrowful Employment till my Father came in and interrupted us Come said he no more Grieving by the Grace of God a few Days will chase away this Indisposition and then we'll come and make my Brother a Visit I must own I parted with her in the utmost Sorrow for I found my Tenderness increase every Moment and if the Thoughts of seeing my dear  Isabella  had not stole into my Memory I shou'd have been inconsolable in this Parting But every thing must give  way to Love We also took Leave of my Father overnight that Ceremony might give us no Hindrance in the Morning When the Veil of Obscurity was drawn to let in the chearful Beams of the Sun my Uncle and I mounted and pursu'd our Journey My Uncle to make the Way less tedious told me many pleasant Stories which gave me so much Satisfaction that we got home before I thought we were half way  After Dinner my Uncle ask'd me if I had Stomach enough to pay a Visit to the Ladies I told him nothing cou'd be more agreeable to me We were soon ready and soon on Horseback When we arriv'd we found a great many Female Visitors and  Isabella  presiding over the TeaTable as usual I observ'd a Blush in her Cheeks when she first saw me which I interpreted in my Favour at first as Love's a Flatterer Yet she took so little Notice of me during the rest of the Day that my Uneasiness was very great The Company staid Supper and  Isabella  to compleat my Discontent took all Occasions to avoid me One Lady I took particular Notice of a Woman about Thirty She seem'd to have a languishing Sweetness in her Countenance that discover'd a Temper without  any Gall She often took notice of my Sadness without the Heed of  Isabella  or the rest of the Company I have heard said she many Commendations of this young Gentleman's Understanding which makes me imagine something extraordinary has put him out of Humour This Speech I must own put me into some Confusion and I thought myself under the Necessity of making a Reply but my Uncle gave me time to recover by answering for me A Man said he must have a fine Time on't to give Proofs of his Understanding among so many Female Tatlers begging this Lady's Pardon bowing to the Stranger but yet I think  Billy  has made his plain by holding his Tongue Women have not Souls capable of edifying by his Discourse And I am sure there is nothing learnt by their eternal Clacks except it gives us an Idea of a Perpetual Motion We are sure of your good Word reply'd the Aunt Yet I am as much concern'd as you are if the young Gentleman has met with any thing to put him out of Humour Perhaps reply'd the Stranger Lady he had rather be in Company more suitable to his Years I think  Isabella  shou'd entertain him Really Madam return'd  Isabella  I am not of your Opinion I have left  off Playthings for some time therefore I imagine I shall be as dull Company for him as he will be for me You are a little too free with the young Gentleman return'd the Mother and in general you are all too hard upon him I have done Madam reply'd  Isabella  I shall say no more and ask Pardon if I have offended him Their Discourse was interrupted by the strange Lady's Husband's Entrance who came to fetch her home When she was gone my Uncle ask'd who she was for to the best of his Remembrance he had never seen her before There is something very extraordinary in that Lady's Fortune said the Aunt and if it were not so late  Isabella  shou'd read her Story wrote by her Husband which she has procur'd a Copy of from the Lady's Original Why then reply'd my Uncle with  Isabella  's Leave we'll trespass upon the Time 'tis Moonlight and we shall find our way home without a Candle I am ready to satisfy you return'd  Isabella  if I once receive my Mother's Commands My Commands are at your Service reply'd the Mother Upon that  Isabella  went out and return'd immediately with a Paper in her Hand This true Story said she is call'd by the Person that wrote it  ELEANORA OR THE WILLING CUCKOLD  ELEANORA  was Daughter to a wealthy Citizen of  London  but having many Children he cou'd not give her a Fortune equal to her Merit She had all the Advantage of Education even for one of a higher Station and there was nothing wanting but Grandeur to make her the finest Woman in the World A Physician of good Practice fell in Love with her and declaring his Passion to her Father gain'd his Consent to address his Daughter But like an indulgent Parent considering the Bargain he was driving was to last for Life frankly told him if he cou'd not gain his Daughter's Heart there was no Advantage to be expected from his Consent for he valu'd the Repose of his Children beyond every thing else in this World The Doctor approv'd of his Sentiments  therefore endeavour'd to gain the Affection of the young Lady As he was a Man of a tolerable Person and handsome Address he gain'd upon her to receive the Proposals of Marriage without any Reluctance  The Nuptials were solemniz'd and in all Appearance they bid fair for a very happy Couple Some Years pass'd with an uninterrupted Series of Contentment In the SummerSeason when Business wou'd permit he with his Family wou'd retire into the Country In their rural Neighbourhood liv'd a Gentleman of a great Estate who seeing  Eleanora  by Accident in her Garden fell desperately in Love with her  When the Gifts of Fortune are thrown upon an Undeserver they only serve to incourage Baseness  This Gentleman was resolv'd to enjoy the virtuous Lady on any Hazard and his first Step was to get acquainted with the Husband which was no very difficult Point to gain it was easy to feign an Indisposition and the Physician gains as much by the Sound as the Diseas'd imaginary Distempers outnumber the real ones The Gentleman was liberal in his Fees to the Doctor and the Doctor had Understanding enough in his Profession to know that he receiv'd his Money for nothing  but that was his Curse the Curse of Avarice  The lovesick Gentleman took all Occasions to visit the Doctor at his own House where he had many Opportunities of conversing with the Lady and the Charms of her Understanding were as strong as those of her Person But then to freeze his Hopes he found her one of an impregnable Virtue He had oft declar'd his Passion to her and she as oft threaten'd to acquaint her Husband but her Threats were of no Use for he was too powerful and too much in Love to fear any thing but her Scorn When the Lady found no Usage wou'd make him forbear his Visits or Addresses resolv'd never to appear when ever he came but this only added Fuel to the amorous Fire and render'd him the more impatient  Burning in this unlawful Flame he was resolv'd by Force to possess her since every other way fail'd He found means to corrupt her Maid for few Servants are Proof against Gold and being inform'd by her that the Doctor was oblig'd to attend a Nobleman his Patient to the  Bath  he determin'd that very Night with the Assistance of the treacherous Maid to execute his villainous  Design In  Eleanora  's Bedchamber was a Closet that open'd on the Inside with a SpringLock into which the Gentleman was convey'd disguis'd by the Servant who took the Key in her Pocket When the innocent Lady came to go to Bed which she did early in the Absence of the Husband she inquir'd for the Key of her Closet to go to her Devotion as usual but the Maid after hunting a great while told her she cou'd not find it therefore must send for the Smith in the Morning The Gentleman has ofttimes declar'd since that the Fervency of her Devotion had almost made him forgo his rash Attempt But Love prov'd too powerful for those pious Thoughts As she was undressing herself to go to Rest her Husband return'd She express'd a great deal of Satisfaction for his sudden and unlook'dfor coming back but it is easy to guess what the Gentleman in the Closet felt at so cruel a Disappointment and he sometimes thought that Heaven had heard her Prayers and prevented his wicked Intention The Doctor told his Wife that he had met his Patient upon the Road who came to Town on Purpose to be near him and his own Apothecary for his Advice After some trivial Talk  he call'd for Supper but the Maid who stood upon Thorns desired that he might go and sup in the Parlour that she might have an Opportunity of conveying the baffled Lover out of the House But the Doctor prov'd obstinate and swore he wou'd sup there and no Persuasions cou'd alter his Resolution Therefore Supper was brought up and the Lover and the Maid wish'd him heartily choak'd Among other Discourse the Doctor ask'd his Wife Why she appear'd so strange to the Squire meaning our closeted Lover You shou'd consider my Dear added he he's one of my best Patients and in all Probability will continue so for he like my Lord has no other Disease than what's form'd by Fancy which is a Companion certain for Life The Doctor said so much upon the Subject that  Eleanora  at last confess'd his unlawful Solicitations And she further added the Way to be freed from his wicked Addresses was never to come into his Sight Ay but my Dear reply'd the Husband if that be his Motive of visiting us I shall lose my Patient when he perceives the Deprivation of your Company  Eleanora  was something surpriz'd at his manner of Reasoning imagining he would  resent it as a Man of Honour ought The Husband perceiving her Confusion at his unexpected Answer cry'd No no my Dear I am very well satisfy'd in your Virtue and that no Temptation will be strong enough to overcome it Therefore I desire whenever the Squire comes you wou'd appear as you were wont and only make a Jest of his Passion I'll warrant you nothing that he can say will hurt your Features or deaden your Complexion Therefore pr'ythee let him say what he will as long as I am satisfy'd you need not have any further Regard  Eleanora  was confounded with the Sentiments of her Husband plainly telling him that Avarice had blinded him and the prattling World wou'd soon declare her guilty if the Squire continu'd his Visits and if your own Honour will not prompt you to put a Period to this dangerous Correspondence I hope said she my Quiet will be of sufficient Force with you The Doctor still prov'd obstinate and insisted upon her receiving the Squire with favourable Looks He being of an obstinate passionate Temper she seem'd at last consenting to his Will hoping Time wou'd some way or other put an End to such an Affair  The Gentleman in the Closet tho' uneasy at his Confinement yet receiv'd some Consolation in the Sentiments of the Husband and conceiv'd Hope even of succeeding in his Wishes thro' the Doctor's Avarice and bad Principles All his Uneasiness was now how to get away undiscover'd his being near the Object of his Wishes gave him no Contentment when his Ideas gave her to the Arms of a dull insipid Husband The Closet where he was look'd into the Garden and being a GroundFloor he got out with little Difficulty but getting over the GardenWall a MastiffDog belonging to the House seiz'd him by the Leg and pull'd him down again and having no Arms about him but what were prepar'd for Love it was with much Difficulty and Danger he escap'd the Mastiff's Fury  When he came home he was oblig'd to send for a Surgeon for the Dog had bit him in several Places and a reasonable Person wou'd imagine the Smart of his Wounds might have cur'd the Pain in his Heart but he was more in Love than ever The Cure of his Hurts kept him at home much longer than his impatient Soul wou'd permit which retarded his Cure The Doctor visited him  every Day and never without a Fee and no doubt in his Heart he wish'd when he was cur'd of this Hurt to meet with another such the first time he went abroad Tho' the Gentleman had form'd a Story far from the Road of Truth yet the Doctor told him he did not doubt but he met with the Accident in pursuing some Love Intrigue  One Day when they were together in the Squire's Garden pretty well warm'd with the Juice of the Grape he spoke to him after this manner Sir I stand in very great need of your Advice without prescribing to the Apothecary I am sick I own but my Disease lies in the Mind I have long languish'd for a beautiful Lady that if I do not enjoy I must seek for my Contentment in the Grave for there is nothing else in this World can give me Ease This Charmer is marry'd and I believe strictly virtuous I shall conceal the Name till I hear your Advice and Sentiments on this Occasion but by the way before you speak I am willing to give  l  to compleat the Business and  l  every time I have the Enjoyment of the Lady The Doctor did not take a long time to consider the Proposal but made him this Answer Sir were it my own Case I  shou'd not long demur upon it for I can assure you I shou'd take the Money and tho' it might seem strange in the Eyes of the World yet in my own private Opinion there is no Crime in't What the worse is a Woman for being enjoy'd by more than her Husband especially with his Consent for I believe there are but few guiltless without it and commit the Sin if it be one without any Profit  The Gentleman finding the Doctor pretty willing in such an Affair told him the whole Truth and that it was his Wife whose Eyes had wounded him To deal as freely with you reply'd the Doctor I imagin'd as much for my Wife has been complaining to me of your criminal Addresses as she calls 'em and I find not as I have put it directly to her that there is no Hope in gaining her knowingly to consent or perhaps if she were willing I shou'd not be easily brought to treat about the Matter But I suppose if it were so I shou'd never have heard of the Affair Well then said the Squire since you are willing to assist me I'll give you my Word and Honour every Article I have mention'd to you shall be made good and let us begin as soon as you please Hold  Sir reply'd the Doctor we are now driving a Bargain I am well assur'd you wou'd not apply to me if you cou'd get your Business done without me therefore I am resolv'd you shall come to my Terms or you shall never see my Wife more First you shall enter into Bonds never to disclose the Secret to any Person Next you must make the  l  a  l  for the first time for how do I know but you may repent your Bargain after Enjoyment for I am convinc'd Expectation exceeds Possession of our Wishes And for the second time  l  the third  l  and the fourth  l  and so to continue  The Gentleman eager as he was to possess the Lady was surpris'd at his Proposal but as his Passion exceeded his Reason soon agreed to the mention'd Articles But the Difficulty was how to have 'em drawn with Secrecy but the Doctor soon solv'd that by telling him he wou'd draw up the Bond himself and the Squire's Servants might sign it without knowing the Contents The first  l  should be brought in Specie and so the rest as they should become due The Gentleman was too much blinded with Love to stop at any thing The next Day the Bond of Secrecy was sign'd with the Penalty of    l  and the Night after that was agreed on for the first Time when he shou'd take Possession of all he desir'd In the Interim the Doctor had many Discourses with his Wife upon the Levity of Women and that the Crime of Adultery was only as People were pleas'd to form it to themselves The poor innocent Lady little imagin'd the base Design that was hatch'd against her and only begg'd her Husband wou'd cease such Discourses that but ill agreed with her Sentiments  The better to carry on the Contrivance the Squire had not made one Visit at the Doctor's since the Night he was confin'd in the Closet and the poor Lady far from IllNature was not displeas'd that he had any thing to hinder his troublesome Visits When the fatal Evening came the Doctor took care in conveying the Gentleman with his  l  into the Closet unperceiv'd by any and that his Wife shou'd not have an Occasion for any thing that was there had order'd all her Female Geers out two Days before with this Reason That he shou'd want that Place intirely to himself for some time  Bedtime came and the poor Victim was laid in Sheets the Emblem of her Innocence  ready for the Sacrifice of unlawful Love The basespirited Husband took an Occasion of putting out the Candle and dismiss'd the Maid Upon the Instant the expecting Lover took his Place and the Doctor prudently and decently retir'd to his Closet I can't give the Reader his Thoughts of what was doing but 'tis reasonable to suppose even the Possession of his  Mammon  cou'd not quite banish some scurvy Ideas The Gentleman after revelling several Hours in guilty Joys retir'd into the Closet as was agreed on dress'd himself and went home with the Help of his Cuckold who to favour his Retreat pretended he heard some Noise in the House Every thing thus succeeded as the Wretch desir'd who notwithstanding his Guilt went to Bed and slept as found as unpolluted Innocence  The next Day he made a Visit to the Squire where he applauded his own Wit for his nice Conduct in the Affair But his chief Reason of visiting the Lover was to know if he design'd another Visit that Night and was much rejoic'd to find the Gentleman as eager as he was willing In short the Gentleman went much oftner than his Fortune wou'd permit and the Cuckold wore his Antlers all  over Gold But tho' the Gentleman's Love was not dead yet the Edge was so far taken off that he began to reason with himself and therefore went not so often as the Doctor desired he reproach'd him with his Decay of Passion for his Wife and the Gentleman wanted to be upon better Terms In short there had like to have been a Breach between 'em For the Doctor wou'd not bate an Ace of his first Price imagining it wou'd be undervaluing the Goods in Trade The Gentleman told him tho' he lov'd his Wife as much as ever yet he shou'd be oblig'd to make less frequent Visits or his Fortune wou'd be much impair'd The Husband was much chagrin'd at it but made himself easy with this Reflexion that if his Love continu'd as he had no Reason to think the contrary his Prudence wou'd give way to it The Lover imagin'd if he cou'd disclose the Intrigue to the Lady she wou'd out of a just Resentment continue the Correspondence more to his Advantage He therefore laid a Plot to get the Husband out when he was expecting the happy Moment in the Closet Accordingly at the Time a Servant came with a Coach and Six to bring the Doctor to my Lord his Patient formerly who was taken dangerously  and suddenly ill He had just time to step into the Closet and to inform the Lover he shou'd be back in two Hours therefore desired him to have Patience till that Time As he went out he desir'd his Wife not to go to Bed till he came back  The Gentleman had taken care he shou'd not return so soon as he imagin'd for he had given Directions to his Servants to turn him out upon a Common Fifteen Miles from his own House in the middle of a dark Night So there we shall leave him to his Disappointment and inward Vexation and go home to the Doctor's House again His Wife sat up beyond the expected Time and would have sat up much longer if the Maid to go to Bed herself had not persuaded her that my Lord might be in very great Danger and consequently her Master oblig'd to attend him The Wife upon these Persuasions went into her BedChamber and dismiss'd her Female Attendant but not being quite easy in her Mind concerning her Brute of a Husband sat down to read which the Gentleman perceiving imagin'd she wou'd be less surpris'd while there was Light than if he shou'd make his Discovery in the Dark therefore open'd the Door softly and came  out of the Closet His first Appearance had so much affrighted her that she had not Power to speak or cry out Madam said the Gentleman don't be surpriz'd at this unexpected and unseasonable Visitation for on my Honour I mean you no Injury and to open your Eyes and prepare you for what I shall say I was conducted hither by your Husband He then proceeded and acquainted her with every Circumstance of their Agreement The griev'd Lady had not Strength enough to hear it out but fell in a Swoon upon the Bed where she sat The Gentleman was truly concern'd for this Accident and us'd all the Means in his Power to bring back her Senses again But when her Understanding was restor'd her Lamentations Sighs and Tears were beyond Expression moving She seem'd resolv'd to receive no Consolation but look'd upon him as the hateful Executioner of her Honour Madam said the Gentleman if I cou'd have imagin'd you wou'd have felt this Injury so sharply I never wou'd have committed it and I shall ever repent to the last of my Life the Sorrow I have given to a Woman of such impregnable Virtue But it is all owing to the Baseness of that Wretch who is no longer  worthy to be call'd your Husband If you can bury the Remembrance of what is past be assur'd for the future I shall be a Friend to your Virtue and never once attempt any thing injurious to your Honour After Death reply'd the Lady in Tears 'tis too late for Physic I am for ever miserable and to aggravate my Sorrows I am even ty'd up from resenting as I ought this irreparable Injury for tho' the Baseness of my Husband might cancel every Matrimonial Tie yet I have a Soul that tells me all my Resentments will be to grieve in Silence till Death releases me from all my Pain  All the Gentleman's Endeavours to sooth her Sorrows prov'd vain and he took his Leave of her with a solemn Resolution never to have any Correspondence with the hateful Husband more sincerely repenting for his Follies past and in the utmost Grief it was no farther in his Power to redress her Injuries  The next Day about Noon the  Willing Cuckold  return'd loaden with Curses for the Trick put upon him and tho' his Wife endeavour'd to conceal her Sorrows yet it was impossible for her Tears stole from her Eyes pursuing one another and Sighs heav'd  in her Breast as if every one intended to be her last Breath The Husband soon found the Meaning of 'em and set himself aukwardly to comfort her and by degrees came to understand the best part of their last Night's melancholy Conversation But when he learnt the Gentleman had resolv'd to make no more Visits in that criminal manner he was almost distracted at the Loss of so good a Customer as he term'd him fell out with the poor innocent  Eleanora  and was outrageous out of all Bounds Sdeath said he this is your Doings Pray what the worse are you for what is past Have not I gain'd more by the Squire in one Month than I have got in three Years by my Practice But however I have one Card more to play yet and since he has resolv'd to make no more of his Visits I'll make him pay well for the last He then declar'd he wou'd have the Penalty of the Bond which he had broke by disclosing to her their Terms of Agreement and if he wou'd not pay him willingly the Law shou'd force him  The poor Wife was quite overwhelm'd with this avaricious Declaration and intreated her base Husband as well as her Sorrows wou'd permit that he wou'd desist in such a  mean Proceeding but to no Purpose Nay he farther told her she must be his chief Evidence in the Cause And tho' she declar'd she wou'd put an End to her Shame by Death yet he still persisted and went to the Gentleman the next Day who at his unreasonable Demand gave him no other Answer but a sound Bastinado and the Cuckold was oblig'd to go home with more Pains in his Body than ever he felt in his Conscience His Head being broke and his Face bruis'd he was oblig'd to stay at home some few Days till his Hurts were heal'd But the poor  Eleanora  felt the Effects of his Illhumour yet notwithstanding this hard Treatment she cou'd never once think of hating him but bore all with the utmost Patience She knew by his Expressions that he had resolv'd to go to Law upon a double Score as well for the Assault as Breach of Articles whenever he was able to go abroad therefore she prevail'd upon herself to send him the following Letter  SIR  YOU know I am already injur'd past Redress and 'tis my greatest Unhappiness that I must sue in one who has been the chiefest  Instrument in my Undoing Nothing in this World can make me forget my Misfortunes yet they will in some part sit lighter on my Mind if you will make up the Quarrel between Mr  T  and yourself otherwise you will have a Life to answer for having resolv'd on Death if there is any farther Proceeding Whatever Charge you are at you shall be repaid out of my yearly Allowance Your Compliance with this will be the only way to gain Forgiveness from Heaven and the wretched  ELEANORA  The Gentleman who had now conceiv'd a disinterested Friendship for her was resolv'd to comply with her just Request without expecting any Return according to her Letter Thereupon he sent a Message to the sordid Wretch that he was willing to come to an Accommodation and in the End got clear of him for  l  But the Matter cou'd not be finish'd without Witnesses to general Releases these having no other Concern than to make an End for their Friend the Squire were not so choice of keeping the Secret and as most Secrets are whisper'd about to the Enlargement of every thing this Story lost nothing by the Carriage  At last Lady  Fame  trumpeted it about the whole Kingdom 'till the cornuted Doctor cou'd not peep abroad for the Scoffs of the Neighbours and his Patients in general abhorring the Fact sell from him which struck so to his Heart being wounded in the tenderest Part Interest that in less than a Year his wretched Soul took its last Farewell of his vile Body  The poor  Eleanora  who resided with her Father when the Story began to be publick cou'd not avoid grieving out of her Sweetness of Temper for a Wretch that did not deserve her least Regard and beg'd her Father to seek out some Retirement for her in the Country where she might end the rest of her Days in peaceful Contemplation free from the Censure of the World Her Father had just procur'd her such a Place as she desired when the Gentleman that had been the Cause of her Sorrows put an End to 'em For being as much in Love with her Virtue as her Beauty made his Addresses to her and as that was the only Way to save her Credit she consented to the Match after her Year of Mourning was over and they have liv'd ever since a Pattern of conjugal Affection  When  Isabella  had finish'd this short true Story her Manner of Reading was approv'd by every one of the Company but myself for I must own I had not recover'd Spirit enough even to open my Mouth for I observ'd she cast her Eyes by turns on all the Company but still avoided me  They were sometimes descanting upon the Story and every Person gave their Sentiments but I was in no Humour to give mine Immediately after we parted and as we rode home  Billy  said my Uncle you seem'd very melancholy all the while you were at my Lady's you hardly took any Notice of those about you and your dumb Civility when we parted spoke your Mind full of some melancholy Thoughts which I judge were concerning the young  Isabella  To deal ingenuously Uncle I reply'd the Carriage of that amiable Creature almost distracts me and I find Love strengthens with every Morning's Sun and tho' I wou'd give all the World for her Esteem yet her Behaviour to me today raises in me a decent Pride which Pride will make me shew my Resentments in refraining my Visits  Pr'ythee  Will  return'd my Uncle don't appear more a Man in this Boyish Passion  than thou dost in the rest of thy Actions I intend to part you and your Mistress next Spring therefore prepare your Mind accordingly for you and your Tutor shall make the Tour of  Europe  for three Years and by that time you may even forget the Name of  Isabella  Nothing Sir said I can make me forget her or her Usage tho' her Scorn will touch me nearer than any thing can fall upon me in this World after losing your Affection Pr'ythee have done with this Topic then said my Uncle The remaining Part of this Summer I intend you and I shall make a Journey over most of the celebrated Places in our own Country that you may not be as most of our young Travellers are inquisitive after the Knowledge of foreign Climates when you are a Stranger to your own Sir the sooner you make this Journey I reply'd the better and you cou'd not propose any thing I like so well Why then said my Uncle tomorrow we'll be going after Dinner I suppose you have nothing material to hinder you Shou'd we not acquaint my Father and Mother with your Intention said I No no matter reply'd my Uncle we'll take no Leave of any one but the Company we have just now left neither  wou'd I do that but as their House will stand in the way of our first Day's Journey The Thoughts of seeing  Isabella  so soon gave me some Satisfaction tho' mixt with a great deal of Anxiety  The next Morning we set out my Uncle altering his Resolution of dining at home intending to dine at my Lady's When we came there we were inform'd the whole Family were gone to dine with the Husband of  Eleanora  This News and Disappointment of not seeing  Isabella  according to my Expectation almost overcame my Spirits but I bore it outwardly well enough and my Uncle seem'd very well pleas'd with my Calmness of Temper tho' alas he little guess'd the Perturbation of my Thoughts My Uncle intended the first Tour as far as  Edinburgh  and accordingly pursu'd our Journey with one Servant only My Uncle was such pleasant Company that I had not Leisure to think of  Isabella  till I went to Rest and even the Fatigues of the Day wou'd hardly prevent my waking all Night Sometimes I imagin'd  Isabella  might have some tender Thoughts of me especially when I call'd to mind her former Conversation with me and that my sudden Absence might possibly create  her some Uneasiness But then her late Behaviour to me cancell'd those pleasing Hopes It is needless to describe the Towns we pass'd but we arriv'd safe at  Edinburgh  without any Accident the once Regal Town of  Scotland    Edinburgh Ag neda  or  Edenburgum  was call'd in the earlier Ages  Castrum Alatum  It stands on a high Eminence and the Plan of the City as it lies resembles the Skeleton of a Human Figure The Castle was reckon'd before the Use of Cannon impregnable and is now of sufficient Strength to withstand a powerful Siege The Buildings are very strong and large compos'd of FreeStone and Mortar of a hard Cement most of the Houses eight Stories high But as we have many Descriptions of  Scotland  I shall take no farther Notice of this City only it is not very convenient to walk the Streets by Night without a Person before you who cries as he passes along  Hand your Haund Haud your Haund  otherwise you may chance to have upon your Heads something offensive to the Nose as well as your Cloaths The Streets in the Morning are cover'd over with somewhat that every one who walks till Ten of the Clock may very well expect good Luck according to our old  English  Saying  Before Noon so many People walk the Streets there is not the least remaining of that illcustom'd Filth  In many Parts of the Streets stands a Person with a great Cloak to cover his Customers with another Conveniency crying  Wha wants me  After visiting several Places in  Scotland  we return'd viewing the noted Places in  England  in our Way home Tho' I must own Curiosity very often took up all my Thoughts yet my Love was not in the least lessen'd and the nearer I came to the Place of the Divine  Isabella  's Abode the more was the Increase of my Anxiety My Uncle had not once mention'd that Passion thro' our whole Journey till the Morning of the Day that put an End to our first Tour Now said my Uncle I imagine you have some Thoughts of your young Mistress I intend to dine there today but shall leave the Conduct of that Part of your Life to yourself and say no more upon that Head But when you stand in need of my Advice or Assistance ask it and you shall have it because I am assur'd you will not ask any thing contrary to the Honour of a Gentleman I return'd suitable thanks for so kind a Condescension and  chang'd the Subject because I thought my Uncle seem'd pleas'd to have it so  We came to my Lady's about Twelve o' Clock and were told they were Dressing My Uncle notwithstanding his Freedom wou'd not interrupt 'em but went to rest upon a Couch in the Parlour I not being so much fatigu'd went into the Garden to indulge my Thoughts But what was my Surprise when I found the lovely  Isabella  sitting by the Fountain with a Book in her Hand on which she seem'd very intent her Back was towards me so that I came within six Paces of her before she saw me At the Noise I made in approaching her she turn'd about and upon seeing me gave a Shriek and put the Book hastily in her Pocket Madam said I if I had thought that my Presence cou'd have created in your Mind any Disturbance I wou'd have sooner cut off these Limbs that brought me hither than have occasion'd it Last time I saw you has made me think my Sight distasteful to you but if you will inform me that I deserve to be thus punish'd I have Courage enough to put an End to my Life if it will be any Satisfaction to you  No Sir reply'd  Isabella  I shou'd grieve to be the Death of any thing of the Brute Creation much more any thing that bears a Human Form And I am so far from thinking there is any Bravery in putting an End to Life that beside the unrepented Crime I think it a Poverty of Spirit and want of Fortitude to bear the Ills of Life Both  Brutus  and  Cato  were in my Opinion proud and pusillanimous and parted with Life to rid 'em of their Fears I cou'd Madam I return'd bear all the Ills of Life but slighted Love Young Gentlemen like you reply'd  Isabella  talking of Love is like Fools talking Divinity it will leave but little Impression on the Judicious and I have formerly told you this Topic is not proper for you to talk of or me to hear Well Madam said I if by covering the Flame of Love I had any Hope Time wou'd kindle that innocent Fire in you that Thought wou'd give me Ease and whatever Climate this Body shou'd be in my Soul wou'd be with you I doubt not reply'd  Isabella  but your Body and Soul were together in your short Travels and this new Passion Love was laid by for Curiosity I will not deny I return'd but Knowledge is what my Mind is bent upon  but even the acquiring that does but the more indear the Thoughts of you and all of your Sex that I see does but oblige me to make Comparisons tho' there is none when I think of you  Well Sir reply'd the Fair One we'll leave this Discourse that I may not provoke any more Compliments and desire to know the Progress of your sudden Journey Sudden indeed I reply'd for my Uncle did not take a Night to consider on't but if you had felt one Particle of the Sorrow if we may so divide it that I felt when we were disappointed of seeing you in our first setting out you wou'd have some Motion of Pity Must every thing cry'd  Isabella  smiling administer to this youthful Folly In me I reply'd 'tis a Whirlpool that swallows every thing that comes near it Well no more Similies nor no more Love return'd  Isabella  but the Account of your Journey Well Madam said I you must be obey'd I then gave her a Description of every thing curious we had observ'd in our short Travels with which she seem'd very much pleas'd I am convinc'd said  Isabella  that all young Gentlemen that travel do not make the same Improvement or rather many do not improve  at all but bring home greater Fools than they carry'd with 'em I mean those that go into foreign Countries for I take yours to be no more than a Journey as we call it But I believe by this time my Mother and Aunt are dress'd therefore it will be very proper for me to wait on 'em Dear Madam said I relieve my Torments and say you do not despise me I shall say no more at this time reply'd  Isabella  than that I must wait on my Mother therefore come along and hold your Tongue Upon this I led her by the Hand and had not an Opportunity of speaking to her in Return because there were several Workmen in the Garden wou'd have heard our Discourse As we were hurrying along the Wind blew her Petticoat upon my Spur which stooping to untangle hastily I prick'd my Fingers with the Rowel and they bled very much searching my Pocket for a Handkerchief to wrap my Hand in I remember'd that I had left it in my Hat in the Parlour when we first came in  Isabella  upon that took hers out and gave it me and at the same time let fall a folded Paper she drew out with the Handkerchief unseen by her I took it up without Observation by letting the Handkerchief fall upon't and  secretly convey'd it into my Pocket When I came in to my Uncle he was fast asleep upon which I stole out again not seeing the Ladies in the Parlour As soon as I came to a convenient Place in the Garden I took out the Paper I had found and when I had open'd it perceiv'd it was the Letter and Song I had formerly sent her and by being much worn in the Folds I imagin'd with a pleasing Satisfaction she had often perus'd it for my Sake At the Bottom of the Letter I found these Lines of the Poet  In vain all Arts the Lovesick Virgin tries  Affects to frown and seems severely wise  In hopes to cheat the wary Lover's Eyes  If the dear Youth her Pity seems to move  And pleads with Tenderness the Cause of Love  Nature asserts her Empire in her Heart  And kindly takes the faithful Lover's Part  By Love her Self and Nature thus betray'd  No more she trusts in Pride's Fantastick Aid  But bids her Eyes confess the yielding Maid  Those Lines I remember'd very well in the celebrated Play of  Tamerlane  But the following Verses as I cou'd not charge my Memory with I fancy'd were of her own Composition  and seem'd as an Answer to the others  Too soon alas I've felt the tingling Dart  And Lovetriumphant rides within my Heart  But spite of pleading Love and Nature's Cause  That thro' the World dispenses rigid Laws  The Flame shall be conceal'd within my Breast  Tho' the sharp Pangs disturb my balmy Rest  I'll learn my Eyes those TellTales of the Mind  To look severe tho' my poor Heart is kind  My Tongue no Whisper of my Griefs shall tell  Ev'n Love shall teach me to dissemble well  I had the Vanity to imagine the last Lines very much concern'd me which certainly wou'd have made me lose my Senses with Joy if a Doubt had not arose that some other might be meant The Thought of that kept the Balance even with Hope and sometimes seem'd to weigh heavier  I was upon the Rack of Thought when a Servant came to acquaint me the Ladies were dress'd and in the Parlour After the ordinary Salutations the Mother and Aunt began to rally my Uncle for going his Journey without taking Leave of 'em Why really reply'd my Uncle I think it the best  way to avoid Impertinence for I hate your formal Parting However you are such eternal Gadders there's no finding you at home for we did you the Honour to call upon you as we set out and that we may spare ourselves some Trouble we shall now take our Leaves for one Month more for we shall set out upon another Tour to morrow Why this is doing Business indeed reply'd the Aunt You'll fatigue the young Gentleman too much Fatigue return'd my Uncle sure if I am able to bear it he very well may But my chief Reason of this sudden Journeying is to shew my Nephew some of his own Country before he begins his Foreign Travels that he may satisfy the Curiosity of any Person that wants to be inform'd when he's abroad Pray when do you intend he shou'd begin his Foreign Travels as you call 'em said the Mother Ev'n as soon as he has finish'd his Home ones return'd my Uncle At this I observ'd  Isabella  's Colour to change and rising hastily to hide her Concern threw up the Sash and look'd out of the Window unobserv'd by any one but myself The Joy I felt was almost without Bounds and I stood in need of the utmost Art to conceal it There were  several Discourses  pro  and  con  upon young Gentlemen's Travelling but my Mind was so full of the happy Extasy I had conceiv'd that I took but little Notice of either Well said my Uncle what you Women say upon these Subjects is but whipt Cream all Froth and nothing substantial But how must we employ ourselves till Dinner for I can't walk What think you of  Ombre  or  Quadrille  said the Aunt With all my Heart a Game at  Ombre  reply'd my Uncle But that won't employ us all said the Mother  Isabella  complain'd of a Pain in her Head and therefore was unfit to make one and for my Part I declar'd I did not understand the Game So the Mother the Aunt and my Uncle sat to it  Isabella  went up into her Chamber and carry'd with her the Object of my Adoration When she was gone I went into the Garden to feed upon Contemplation and in my own Imagination thought myself the happiest Creature in the Universe But my Satisfaction did not last long for walking upon a Terras that overlook'd the Country I saw a Coach and Six stop at the Gate There came out of it an elderly Gentleman follow'd by a young one about Twenty as I guess'd and before I cou'd make any  Judgment of 'em two Fellows that were at work under the TerrasWall who did not see me were observing the Coach Adso said one to the other There's young Lady's Suitor Sir  Eustace  and his Father com'd again I had not Power to stir at this unexpected Knowledge and remain'd a considerable time like one thunderstruck A thousand Resolutions crouded into my Mind and all to the destroying of my Peace My Rival was hated with an immortal Hatred before I knew him and his or my Death was fix'd as irrevocable as Fate The Perturbation of my Fancy work'd so violently that my Strength fail'd me and I fell almost Senseless upon a GrassPlat where my feeble Limbs had unknowingly carry'd me When the Hurry of my confus'd Thoughts was over they gave me absolute Despair I was assur'd an Hour before she lov'd and Hope had flatter'd me that I was the happy He but now I as surely thought my Rival was the Object of her Wishes Why then thought I why shou'd I endeavour to destroy one whom she wou'd wish shou'd live that will not be the way to gain her but rather make her loath me Death seem'd to me the only Friend yet thro' a Principle  of my Faith I cou'd not put an End to Life I only wish'd for Death without the Thought of separating Soul and Body  Long I lay in my Confusion of Thought till at last I beheld the divine  Isabella  in the Garden looking about as for something she had lost which I imagin'd to be the Paper I took up She was within two Paces of me before she saw me she was so intent on what she was about and when her Eyes encounter'd mine she started back as tho' she had beheld something baneful to her Well Madam said I must I ever be the Object of Horror to your Eyes and must you always start at the Sight of me as if you saw the Form of one rise from the Grave A little Time will take this Bugbear from your Sight I hope for ever I know I can never deserve your Love and yet I cannot bear to see you make another happy For Heaven's sake cry'd  Isabella  surpris'd what is it moves you so Why do you lie stretch'd on the Ground and look as if some Distraction had seiz'd you Come give me your Hand and let us walk have a Question to ask you which I expect to be truly resolv'd in Have you found any Paper of Writing since you came into the Garden There Madam  said I and wou'd to Heaven I had never seen it giving her the Paper there take it I must own I cannot blame you Love is not to be forc'd 'tis a freeborn Child of the Mind I only think the young Gentleman is compleatly bless'd I am sure I shou'd be distracted with the mighty Joy in such Return of Love  Well Sir said  Isabella  this Freedom I can forgive because I see something extraordinary has ruffled your Temper I doubt not but you have read these Lines pointing to the Letter that were writ on the Blank Leaf 'tis the Thought of a young Gentlewoman a Neighbour of mine I liking the Lines transcrib d 'em I was under some Concern I own for the Loss of the Paper because the Ballad that you sent me was along with it and I promis'd her to copy it and send it back this Evening  I soon perceiv'd by some Confusion in the Utterance of these Words that what she said was to disguise the Truth and that Thought stabb'd me to the Heart tho' her Civility to me seem'd tender enough yet I imagin'd that was only to blind me and prevent any farther Enquiry While we both were in great Confusion of Thought we perceiv'd  Sir  Eustace  coming down out of the Hall into the Garden To let you see your Suspicions are unjust said  Isabella  for I had inform'd her what I heard one of the Workmen say I'll instantly avoid the Person we see coming With that she went into a private Walk and opening a Door that led into another Garden took me by the Hand and pull'd me in after her then shut to the Door again I must confess this Proceeding began to revive Hope that 'till then seem'd quite expir'd This Condescension said I does indeed something ease my Heart but yet will not cure my Pain That young Gentleman no doubt comes here to make his Addresses to you and coming thus publickly attended by that elderly Gentleman which I suppose to be his Father tells me he has the Approbation of your Mother and Aunt  I will not deny reply'd  Isabella  but that Sir  Eustace  pretends to be my Lover and my Mother and Aunt do not discountenance him But they have more Tenderness for me than to force my Inclination And you more Duty I reply'd than to contradict 'em No Sir return'd  Isabella  I am satisfy'd they never will impose any one upon me for a Husband  or shou'd they endeavour it tho' Duty is very prevalent with me yet in that one only Thing I wou'd dare to disobey  Well Madam my Destiny I find has mark'd me for unhappy for Title and Riches must prevail I have told you before reply'd  Isabella  that Fortune I despise and Title can no more make a Man Good and Virtuous in my Opinion than a good and virtuous Man can make a Title A King can give Honour but not Honesty yet like the Sun it shines upon Weeds that are often admir'd for their eminent Worthlesness Your Sentiments of Honour divine  Isabella  I reply'd are so just that inspires me to ask you one Question and hope an Answer What is it return'd  Isabella  in some Confusion Am I to hope said I or despair I wou'd not have made the important Question so abruptly but the Time of my Departure is so short and my Unhappiness of not seeing you so often as my impatient Heart desires will I am assur'd from your Goodness stand excus'd whatever your Heart can say for or against me Why will you Press me reply'd  Isabella  now I have I return'd told you my Reasons already Think ere you answer me for my whole Peace of  Mind depends upon't and if I am banish'd from your Presence now with cold Despair I am assur'd I cannot survive it No Love was ever more pure than mine or stronger A distant Hope of once possessing you wou'd arm me for all Dangers and I cou'd wait patiently an Age of Torments if in the End I shou'd be blest with your consenting Love Do not surmise my Passion youthful Folly 'tis rooted in my Soul so deep that no Storm of Fortune can ever shake its Foundation If you cannot love freely declare it as you wou'd your Vows to Heaven I shall only blame my Stars not you and take for ever from your Sight an Object hateful to himself as well as you  Hate reply'd  Isabella  is not in my Nature and since you press me to declare myself the Person you saw me fly from never shall have my Heart and be assur'd if you remain ever constant I shall no doubt in time be willing to reward that Constancy This Declaration continu'd  Isabella  blushing is much more than I so soon intended to let you know and what Constructions you put upon it keep it a Secret from the whole World Let not your Uncle whom I know you can hide nothing from be acquainted  with the least Syllable This from a Person of  Isabella  's Character was enough to raise me from the Dead I said all an impatient loving Heart cou'd suggest and was so extravagant in my transporting Joy that  Isabella  check'd me telling me I shou'd certainly discover something extraordinary had happen'd to me if I had not a Heed to my Eyes and Tongue Before we parted she open'd all her Soul to me telling me her Passion did not seem so violent as mine but more lasting  In short never was a Man more happy than I thought myself However Prudence oblig'd us to part tho' I cou'd have liv'd for ever in her Company She gave me the Key to let me thro' the same Way we came in while she went another Way first commanding me not to shew the least Resentment to the young Nobleman if we shou'd meet I reply'd I knew so well the Nature of his Disease that if he truly lov'd her he had now a Title to my Pity We left each other with a Promise to meet in the Afternoon again in the same Place if an Opportunity offer'd  When I had parted with the divine  Isabella  I went up the Walk with the utmost  Contentment in my Heart tho' I endeavour'd to conceal it in my Countenance as much as possible Upon the Terras I met Sir  Eustace  whom I saluted and pass'd him he return'd it indeed but with too much Pride as I thought However I pass'd on and took no farther Notice of him When I came into the Parlour I found the old Gentleman with the two Ladies and my Uncle playing at  Quadrille  and  Isabella  reading in the Window Immediately after Sir  Eustace  came in and finding  Isabella  exprest abundance of of fulsome Joy at the Sight of her I must own I was oblig'd to make use of all my Philosophy to keep my Temper and shou'd very hardly have done it if  Isabella  had not rally'd him with so much Wit as in the end gave me a malicious Satisfaction I observ'd all the Company seem'd as well pleas'd only the Gentleman that came with him but he being something deaf cou'd not understand every thing that was said  When Dinner was serv'd in Sir  Eustace  plac'd himself next  Isabella  and was continually helping her to such Quantities that wou'd have serv'd her a Week I observe Sir said  Isabella  you wou'd have me eat for  the whole Family or if you imagin'd every body in Company had as good a Stomach as you suppose me to have by your loading my Plate they might rise ready for another Dinner However I am oblig'd to you You mistake the Gentleman reply'd my Uncle he's a young  Cannibal  he only fats you as we do Chickens in hope of feeding upon you Sir  Eustace  took what my Uncle said as a very good Jest and laugh'd heartily saying if he shou'd feed upon her she wou'd go very much against his Stomach At the End of his ridiculous Jest he laugh'd so immoderately with his Mouth full that he sputter'd it in my Face I wou'd the Gentleman said I had taken an Opportunity of laughing when his Mouth was empty I shou'd have been the more oblig'd to him Harkye young Gentleman reply'd Sir  Eustace  you were told before I was a  Cannibal  and I can assure you I often eat Youngsters that are too forward Really Sir said I very calmly I can't see that prodigious Stomach in your Countenance or any thing there wou'd make me afraid to meet you any where fasting  The Company laugh'd to see his Uneasiness at my Reply but he gave me no Answer  Isabella  I observ'd seem'd much concern'd at what I said and with a Look with her Eyes told me I shou'd carry the Jest no farther Well Sir said I without jesting I mean no Harm if you make any farther Constructions on my Words but as a Jest you go beyond my Meaning This mollifying Speech seem'd to raise his Anger more A Jest has often cost the Maker his Life reply'd Sir  Eustace  and such young Gentlemen as you shou'd remember the Smart of the Rod and curb their Tongues for fear of a Whipping Sir said I I presume your voracious  Cannibal  's Stomach is not quite appeas'd therefore I'll take a Walk in the Garden for fear you shou'd fall foul on me in an improper Place saying this I arose and taking my Hat and Sword out of the Window went into the Garden  The whole Company arose to stop the Baron who offer'd to follow me My Uncle began to be very much disturb'd upon my Account and as he told me afterwards did intend to follow me But thinking to oblige me he desired the Mother to send  Isabella  after me When she came up to me she began to reproach me with my Conduct telling me if I had any Hope or Desire to gain her Heart  I must conceal my Passion from all the World and this Proceeding will betray the Secret if not on your Side said she tenderly I fear my Concern will Those Words have Force enough to restore me to my Senses were I in the Grave said I and after this Confession that makes me the happiest of Mortals even Blows shall not make me draw my Sword if you desire it No said  Isabella  I know what Men of Honour shou'd bear and I shou'd despise the Wretch for being a Coward Yet Madam I reply'd Cowardice can no more be help'd than the Tincture of a Skin 'tis rooted in the Nature and known Cowards like Fools shou'd be pity'd Certainly no Man wou'd be a Coward if he cou'd help it reply'd  Isabella  but when I say I shou'd despise a Coward I imagine to myself the Man that has true Courage has every other noble Qualification that will make him deserving as on the contrary a Coward Soul inherits every weak Failing and is as incapable of doing a worthy Action as the Man of Spirit is of doing a mean one I shall ever submit my Actions to you Madam said I Then said  Isabella  immediately return and be reconcil'd to the hot Spark within whom the more I know  the more I despise and I fansy that Declaration won't displease you but I'll have no Reply now Nothing more but this said I you promis'd me a Meeting in the Afternoon which I fear will be a difficult thing to bring to pass Do you start Difficulties reply'd  Isabella  Never fear I warrant we'll bring it about The same River that runs thro' your Garden runs thro' the Bottom of ours therefore I'll propose Fishing We'll go first and the Man shall take us two over to an Island in the River and return My Mother does not care to go into a Boat and the rest of the Company I suppose out of Complainsance will stay with her But I fear Madam the young Spark will come to interrupt us said I Why that's all we have to fear reply'd  Isabella  but as soon as he comes we'll return and that I hope will give you some Satisfaction Do but consider my Temper and you'll find this is enough to make you easy This I can do without Suspicion from any one for none of my Family suspects either you or me to be in Love There have so many Accidents odly concurr'd today that I will no longer conceal it from you First your sudden Departure then this Rival and the disagreeable Quarrel  Tho' your Rival is the main Motive join'd with your Foreign Tour which I understand by your Uncle is for three Years But I'll say no more now in the Afternoon we shall have a better Opportunity As soon as I came into the DiningRoom Sir  Eustace  met me with a constrain'd Smile and told me he was sorry any Uneasiness had been created by Words utter'd without Thought and shou'd for the future be willing to have more Acquaintance with me I shou'd have consider'd indeed there is some Difference in our Years said he therefore I own myself the Criminal and ask Pardon for what's past Years said my Uncle do not always imply Age or Understanding for some at Fifteen have the Discretion of Thirty and FiftyFive in a good Constitution is an abler Man than Five and Thirty I mean continu'd my Uncle smiling some Men are younger at Sixty than others at Thirty That is a Compliment reply'd the Aunt we may very reasonably suppose design'd for yourself However let's have no more of 'em we'll make an End of our Dinner and drink a Cup of Oblivion and then all will be well again Meaning Tea I suppose reply'd my Uncle where every Cup is broaching new Scandal  and we shall have so much Noise and so little understood that it will put me in mind of the Confusion of  Babel    I found the Company were not rightly in Humour yet I perceiv'd with some Satisfaction that I was not the Occasion even the old Gentleman that came with Sir  Eustace  appear'd concern'd for his Behaviour After we were risen from Table the Company divided into Parties all but my Uncle who went to take his usual Afternoon's Nap The deaf old Gentleman singled me out and led me into the Garden Said he I have the Misfortune of having but an ill Hearing yet I heard enough to know my Son was much in Fault Youth Fortune and Title make him too presuming I have with the best Advice I am capable of giving him endeavour'd to soften his too turbulent Temper but I fear 'tis rooted too deeply in his Nature ever to be eras'd Honour shou'd be tack'd to Nobility yet I find Mankind so deprav'd in their Nature that the more Power they have the greater Propensity they have to do Evil which shews to the Judicious Riches and Titles ill plac'd But as Nobility can be no more inherited than Virtue so in my Opinion he is noble that has noble Inclinations  I shou'd not talk to one so little advanc'd in Years in this manner as I do to you if I had not been inform'd by my Lady of a ripe Understanding in so early an Age I expect no Reply in the Complimental Way I only beg you wou'd forgive my Son and for the future know me for your Friend I shou'd desire your Conversation but my Infirmity will not admit of it therefore I shall take my Leave of you Upon this he went from me and left me full of Regard for his right Way of Thinking  While I was musing upon what he said to me  Isabella  came down the Walks follow'd by a Servant with FishingTackle Come Sir said she as she past me you are to teach me how to catch Fish for as yet I am but a mere Bungler With all my Heart Madam I reply'd When the Servant had put us over to the Island  Isabella  said to him  John  I desire you wou'd bring over no Strangers No no Madam  John  reply'd if you'll be pleas'd to tell me when I shall wait on you to bring you back I'll lock the Boat on the other side and be out of the way till then Do said  Isabella  and fetch us about an Hour hence When  John  was gone I fell at the Fair One's Feet and gave her  Thanks for this surprising Condescension What Words divine  Isabella  said I shall I use to express my Gratitude but there are none that will speak the least Part of what my Mind feels you have rais'd me from the Bottom of Despair to the Summit of Joy and when my Heart forgets this Goodness may I be for ever miserable Your Protestations I believe return'd the divine  Isabella  raising me from the Earth and I will freely declare if you ever shou'd prove false the Knowledge will break my Heart I was going once more to fall at her Feet but was interrupted in my exalted Bliss by a Noise we heard at the Boat  Sir  Eustace  missing us in the Garden and being inform'd by the Aunt where we were gone follow'd us But  John  had made the Boat too fast for him to undo without his Assistance But in the Bustle he made to unloose it he tumbled into the Water and by that time I came to the Waterside he was sunk to the Bottom All other Passions flew immediately from my Breast but Pity and when I saw the Danger he was in I threw myself into the Water and by good Fortune caught hold of a ShoulderKnot he wore and brought him to the Island without  any Appearance of Life When I had dragg'd him on Shore with the Assistance of  Isabella  I held him up by the Heels against a Tree where he disgorg'd the Water he had swallow'd and fetching two or three Groans he came to himself tho' so faint he cou'd not stand and for want of proper Remedies we were in Fear he might not survive the Accident for we were too far from the House to make 'em hear us I therefore pull'd off my Coat and Waistcoat and swam across the River to the Garden and inform'd the Family of the Accident but  John  was no where to be found The Difficulty we had to get the Boat loose took up so much time that Sir  Eustace  was almost perish'd with Cold ere we cou'd bring him Assistance and  Isabella  's Fear had almost put her in the same Condition It was with much Difficulty by pouring Cordials into his Mouth that we brought him once more to his Senses He was put to bed but the Fright and the Water he drank threw him into a high Fever The Hurry of my Spirits and being so long in my wet Cloaths gave me a great deal of Disorder and having no other Cloaths to shift me for my Uncle's Servants were gone home with our Equipage I was  oblig'd to go to Bed too but had the Satisfaction of being laid in  Isabella  's Bed and what heighten'd that Satisfaction I was strip'd of my wet Shirt and by the Mother's Order had one of  Isabella  's Shifts put on me The Joy took away all Thoughts of my Disorder but it cou'd not hinder a strong Fever seizing me to the utmost Concern of all the Family The Father of the Nobleman express'd more Concern for me than his Son giving me all the Encomiums due to the most consummate Virtue that maugre the Distaste I might have justly conceiv'd against his Son I had hazarded my own Life to preserve his I must own the Action gave me a great deal of Satisfaction and the Praises tho' no Addition to Pride for that's a Failing I hope I shall ever be a Stranger to yet pleas'd me because I had done what many of my Age wou'd have neglected or refus'd  The following Day my Fever abated but Sir  Eustace  seem'd worse and worse I was griev'd I cou'd not have an Opportunity of seeing the Divine  Isabella  alone during my short Illness But I had the Happiness of receiving a Letter from her which she put into my Hand unobserv'd by any one But the Joy I felt in reading the following  Lines had more Force than any of the Doctor's Prescriptions towards my Cure  WHAT shall I say to describe the Anxiety of my Mind for your Illness My Heart unguarded now from all the Niceties of my Sex freely declares itself yours But yet let us both be careful I wou'd not have our Passions whisper'd in a Desart tho' perhaps thro' the Knowledge of your Virtues it might not meet with many Obstacles My Mother and Aunt I am assur'd contemn the Addresses of your Rival even as much as I do However once more I beg you to be cautious conceal our Loves even from your good Uncle and be assur'd the two Persons under our Roof are the entire Joy and Contempt of ever yours  ISABELLA  P S  At our next Meeting I shall declare more  I wish'd my Indisposition had continu'd longer that I might have had the Satisfaction of being under the same Roof with my dear  Isabella  But my Health return'd and I was oblig'd to go home to my Uncle's without conversing in private with her However  the Contentment of my Mind appear'd in my Face and my Uncle several times took Notice of it yet I conceal'd according to her Desire even from him the Reason of it  When we had been at home a Week my Uncle told me we shou'd make another Tour the next Day and I gather'd by his Discourse that we shou'd not make any more Visits to  Isabella  's Mother till we came back which wou'd not be in six Weeks The Heartbreaking I felt almost kill'd me I did not doubt but I cou'd have gain'd Leave to make a Visit alone but I knew I must then have discover'd more than  Isabella  wou'd like I cast about several Hours how to send her a Letter without Suspicion but to my Mortification cou'd not pitch upon an Expedient But while I was perplexing my Brain to no Purpose I had the unexpected Joy of seeing her Coach stop at the Door and before I cou'd recover myself from the pleasing Confusion she enter'd with her Mother and Aunt But understanding my Uncle was in the Garden the Mother and Aunt went to him and left the divine  Isabella  alone with me in the Parlour The sudden Surprize had ty'd my Tongue fast and it was  some time ere I cou'd speak a Word All I cou'd do was to fall at her Feet with the utmost Transport of Joy which was increas'd by her raising me and putting her Lily Hand round my Neck pressing my Head close to her Bosom I spoke at last but such wild incoherent Speeches that gave her more Satisfaction she told me than if I had utter'd Volumes of regular Nonsense vulgarly call'd Love But when I told her of our intended Journey the next Day her amiable Countenance was overclouded with Sorrow and ere we cou'd recover ourselves my Uncle her Mother and Aunt came out of the Garden but before they enter'd the Room where we were  Isabella  told me she had provided a Place where we might send Letters to each other without any Suspicion she wou'd seek for an Opportunity after Dinner to inform me and if that shou'd not happen she wou'd contrive to let me know by a Line before tomorrow Morning  After Dinner  Isabella  and I were engag'd much against our Inclination to make up a Set at  Quadrille  and to add to our Mortification we were oblig'd to part without any further Opportunity of Converse However I was forc'd to keep up a chearful  Countenance that my Uncle might not suspect the Chagrin I felt The Night prov'd as disagreeable a one to me as the Evening and I cou'd not get any Rest till it was almost time to rise As I was dressing myself my Servant told me there was a Boy at the Door had brought me a Present of a Brace of Partridges I order'd him to come in when I ask'd him from whence they came he told me he had a Note in his Pocket wou'd inform me As soon as I receiv'd it I soon knew the dear Character to be  Isabella  's When I had dismiss'd the Boy I open'd the Note and found the Contents as follows  SIR  WHEN I left you Yesterday I carry'd Discontent home with me which never left me till Sleep which was slow in coming to my Aid drove it away Whenever you have any Time hangs heavy on your Hands you may write an Account of your HomeTravels and direct 'em to Mrs  Jane Stubbs  at The poor Woman has the Misfortune of wanting the Use of Letters and always brings 'em to me to read therefore whatever comes to her Hands will be sure to come to mine I shall say no more my Time being short but this I care not  how much Trouble the good Woman gives me so that you may write to her as soon as you please who will bring it to one who is entirely  Yours  c  The Pleasure this little Note gave me was partly taken from me in that I did not detain the Boy to send an Answer Yet upon second Thoughts I imagin'd it wou'd be safer to carry one myself I was soon determin'd wrote one and went to the House and was there before the Boy who I suppose might loiter by the way This Woman was a Tenant of the divine  Isabella  's and had formerly been her Nurse she cou'd not be said to love her Mistress but rather doated on her This Creature was the Picture of Honesty and she was so well assur'd of her young Lady's Conduct she made no Scruple to tell me the Letters I wou'd honour her with shou'd faithfully be convey'd to the proper Hands Why then to begin said I there's one I don't care how soon it was where it shou'd be I don't think it proper till after Dinner reply'd the good Woman for tho' I am ever welcome at my young Landlady's Mother's yet as I have not been come long from thence I think it will not  be quite so well to go so soon I agreed with her in that Particular and took my Leave first making her a handsome Present for tho' those sort of People may continue uncorruptively honest yet it is as well when it is made their Interest to be so  The next Day my Uncle resolv'd we shou'd make a Visit to my Father and Mother and I was of the Opinion it wou'd be highly proper as well as a Desire I had to see how the Family went on When we arriv'd there we found every thing according to our Wishes There was such a Harmony between my Father and my Mother that my Father told my Uncle smiling his Wife's late Illness had mended her Temper prodigiously and he wou'd not have her be indispos'd in the same manner again for ever so much for if said he she shou'd and be better in proportion she wou'd be too good for him and only fit for Heaven We found every thing so much to our Liking that we took our Leave of 'em with a great deal of Satisfaction and my Uncle told me as we were going home that Miracles were not ceas'd for there was an ill Woman mended  The next Day we set out on our intended Progress and met with nothing extraordinary  in our Course only one Thing I thought was odd enough In a small Village near the SeaCoast in  Sussex  as we were at Church on a  Sunday  with a full Congregation a Man came to the ChurchDoor and cry'd out  A Wreck A Wreck  The Congregation immediately unbuckled their Devotions and were crouding out as fast as they cou'd tho' the Parson had not gone thro' half his Sermon When the good Man found they were going to leave him to finish his Sermon by himself he call'd to 'em with an audible Voice desiring his Audience to hear  one  Word before they went Upon his earnest Entreaty most of 'em turn'd about to hear the  one  Word When the Parson found they seem'd willing to hear him he cry'd out  Pray good Folks let us start fair  and upon that prest to the Door with all the Expedition he cou'd and in a few Minutes my Uncle and I might have robb'd the Church for there was not a Soul to hinder us The Oddity of the Thing very much surpriz'd us tho' it often made us merry afterwards Well  Will  said my Uncle when the Church was empty we may as well say our Prayers at home as stay here by ourselves What Sir said I have you no Curiosity to see the Proceeding of this wild  Congregation Why I cannot say but I have reply'd my Uncle let us get our Horses and follow 'em When we came to the Gentleman's where we lay a Friend of my Uncle's we found the House as empty as the Church for they were all gone upon the same Design and my Tutor with our Servants along with 'em as we suppos'd So we were forc'd to be our own Grooms and follow'd 'em We cou'd not well miss our Way for we saw People from all Quarters running before us When we came within Sight of the Sea we cou'd perceive several Vessels labouring to keep from the Shore with all their Art and Industry for the Wind was very high and blew right ashore as the Sailors term it But what Horror had I in my Mind to see in what Anxiety the Wretches on Shore were for fear they shou'd escape and save themselves At last one of 'em bulg'd upon the Rocks and split in Pieces at which Sight the Barbarians for I can term 'em no less gave a Shout and threw one another down for Eagerness who shou'd be foremost not the least regarding the poor unfortunate Wretches plung'd in the Waves But my Uncle and I with my Tutor and our Servants that were there before us gave  'em all the Assistance we cou'd and with much Trouble and some Hazard sav'd Five out of Eight that were in the Vessel tho' with many a hearty Curse for our Pains for it seems they cou'd not make the Vessel a Wreck if there were any of the Crew alive However the inhuman Brutes fell to securing every thing as fast as ever they cou'd while we carry'd the poor Shipwreck'd Wretches to the next Village to give 'em some Refreshment The Vessel was a  Frenchman  laden with Wine which they brought to exchange for Corn the common Custom of all the SeaCoast contiguous to  France  which may prove a pernicious Custom if the Produce of Grain shou'd ever fail us in  England    We took our Leaves that Evening of my Uncle's Friend who in my Opinion seem'd very glad to be rid of us for he was as busy about the Wreck as any of the rest A few Miles farther a  Dutch  Vessel was cast away and all the unhappy Sailors drown'd Our Road lying through the same Place three Days afterwards several People had sold Part of a new Fount of Letter of the  Greek  Alphabet at a Penny  per  Pound as waste Metal when perhaps the Purchaser had paid  fifty times more for it What Brutes are these Wretches Had they been their own Countrymen it had been the same What Horror must it be to the poor Sailors when having weather'd many a Storm and perhaps escap'd from their Enemies to come in Sight of their native Country and perish for want of timely Assistance from their Countrymen who wish for nothing more than their Deaths What can the worst of the Savage Kind do more Nay I have been inform'd that to make a Vessel a Wreck they have often murder'd the poor Sailors that have been struggling for Life lifting their Hands in vain for Succour to those that have prov'd their Murderers We ought not to condemn the Heathenish  Indians  that serve the  Europeans  in the same manner who do it from the Love of Liberty who imagine and not unjustly that the  Europeans  come to enslave 'em These Reflexions cast a Melancholy upon our whole Company for some time after and the Diversity of new Objects cou'd hardly wipe away the Thoughts of the other When my Uncle ask'd a Farmer in that Neighbourhood how he cou'd be so inhuman to feed on the Loss of his FellowCreatures he answer'd if it were not  now and then for such a lucky Hit he shou'd never be able to pay his Landlord his Rent besides Custom had made it natural to him and he cou'd not call that a Crime so generally follow'd by all his Neighbours All we cou'd say cou'd not make him think of leaving off so profitable a Perquisite as he was pleas'd to term it Which put me in mind of those excellent Verses of  Waller  's  Bold were the Men who on the Ocean first  Spread their new Sails when Shipwreck was the worst  More Dangers now from Man alone we find  Than from the Rocks the Billows or the Wind  Some few Days after my good Tutor was attack'd with a violent Fever which we imagin'd he had got by endeavouring to save the poor shipwreck'd People tho' we were all as much wet with the Billows of the Sea as he was This Accident stopt us at  St Edmund'sBury  in  Suffolk  several Days and tho' my Uncle spar'd no Cost for his Recovery yet the good Man expir'd to the great Grief of us all We bury'd him decently tho' privately not without wetting his Grave  with my Tears for he was a Person that deserv'd and had a great Share in my Friendship  After his Funeral we set ourselves forward for Home and for my own Part with a heavy Heart and my Uncle seem'd very much griev'd because he ever express'd a great deal of Satisfaction in trusting to him the Conduct of my Youth in my Tour of  Europe  Yet the Imagination of my Travels being retarded for some time gave me some Pleasure because I shou'd have the Happiness of seeing my dear  Isabella  longer When we came home  Betty  inform'd me my Motherinlaw had made her a Visit and express'd such a Horror at my former Treatment that they did nothing but weep all Day She made her several Presents and seem'd very much pleas'd at her Settlement in my Uncle's Family But the Idea of my charming  Isabella  took up all my Thoughts and fatigu'd as I was I sent her the following Letter as soon as I dismounted  MY FAIREST  THE Thoughts of You took from me all the Satisfaction I shou'd have receiv'd from the Variety of Objects that oppos'd my  View Every thing I saw put me in mind of you The Roses and Lilies were Remembrancers of your amiable Face the Down of Swans of the Whiteness and Softness of your Skin when I heard the Warbling of the Nightingale it put me in mind of your Voice the Dove of your soft Disposition and the soaring Lark of that compleat Beauty that surmounts all other Women's as that surmounts the Soaring of all other Birds When I think of your Perfections my Mind is fill'd with a thousand Inquietudes for such wondrous Charms are far above the Possession of any Mortal What wou'd I give to read the Book of Fate to see if my happy Stars had allotted me the Possession of so much Beauty But if the eternal Volume were disclos'd to me and I had the Liberty of reading my Destiny and shou'd find we were not pair'd above my Woes wou'd be of short Duration for Death wou'd soon put an End to my hated Life What shall I say to express my Passion The Sun the Moon the Day and Night all put me in mind of you and the Griefs I feel at our near Separation almost rend my Heart asunder The three Years I am to be absent from my Love to me will far exceed the Age of  Nestor  The very Imagination disturbs me Day and Night  for every Hour is spent in thinking of the divine  Isabella    When gloomy Night o'erspreads the Earth  And all retire to downy Rest  My Sorrows feel a second Birth  And dismal Thoughts disturb my Breast  Yet ev'ry Thought is still on thee  Thou Image of the Queen of Love  Ev'n halting Age wou'd fly to see  Those Charms that wou'd a Hermit move  When I behold the Silver Light  With dusky Spots upon her Face  I know my Fair One shines more bright  And think the Moon usurps thy Place  What Dangers wou'd I face for thee  Whose pointed Eyes have pierc'd my Heart  Thy Captive never wou'd be free  But hug with Joy the pleasing Dart  Forgive me dear  Isabella  in pretending to Poetry but be assur'd the Inspiration comes from you and tho' the Numbers fall short of your allconquering Charms receive 'em as a Tribute from my Love How many Ages more will it be ere I behold thy Face I am but a  worthless Flower that must perish if depriv'd of thy allchearing Beams I hope my hated Rival has not renew'd his Addresses It is the Fears of Love that make me dread even my  Isabella  shou'd be look'd upon by other Eyes than mine who wishes the End of Life if I shou'd view that Day when I shall cease to subscribe myself eternally  Yours  c  The next Morning I receiv'd an Answer to mine which gave me more Joy than a Mariner receives after escaping a dangerous Tempest and no Hope left for Safety  IT is in vain to hide my Heart from one that has it in his Possession Use it with the Tenderness it deserves for taking Shelter in your Breast Be assur'd of my Constancy for nothing shall ever make me change my Love I am almost asham'd to commit my Weakness to Writing but almighty Love will have it so I thank you for your Poetry and be it good or bad I have sent you some Trash of my own but find no Fault with it for you are the  Apollo  that has inspir'd me However destroy it when you have read 'it as I wou'd have you  destroy all Thoughts of Jealousy of him you call your Rival  If I within the Heavens shou'd be  Instead of  Cynthia  's lucid Rays  I'd borrow all my Light from thee  And rule the Nights as thou the Days  Shou'd there a Flow'r be plac'd for me  To nourish as it blooming grew  Sweet  William  shou'd that Flower be  For I wou'd shine on none but you  I almost repent of being so open as Murderers do when the Deed is done and Punishment appears in view But it is done and past Recall as is the Heart of your ever constant  ISABELLA  P S  I had clos'd this Letter but unseal'd it again to let you know that your Uncle has just sent a Footman to my Mother to tell her he intends to dine with us tomorrow but if he comes alone I can't for my Soul say he will be heartily welcome  As we were going the next Day to dine at  Isabella  's Mother's my Uncle receiv'd a Letter from a distant Relation which he gave me to read  SIR  UNderstanding Mr  Meredith  my young Cousin's Tutor is dead I take the Liberty to recommend a young Gentleman to you who I dare prowise will answer every thing you desire from such a Person He shall wait on you tomorrow I choose to give you this early Notice for fear you shou'd provide yourself He understands the dead Languages as well as the modish Living Mistake me not I mean all the  European  Tongues but  Low Dutch  and  Muscovite  which I presume you will have but little Occasion for  Your affectionate Kinsman N L  After I had read the Letter my Uncle told me it was from a Person he cou'd very well confide in and his Recommendation was sufficient to him however  Billy  said my Uncle you shall see the Gentleman for this is your Affair If you can't like him I won't force him upon you no more than I wou'd do a Wife Well Sir said I tomorrow will decide that tho' I am apt to  believe I shall like him as well as you do I am glad to find he is not a Man in Years for they are generally so illnatur'd the Precepts they teach us favour too much of Severity And very often reply'd my Uncle Youth borders too much upon Levity However I have told you more than once that I shall leave you to your own Discretion  When we came to the House we found the Company together in the Parlour and the Cloth laid ready for Dinner I am glad you're come said  Isabella  's Mother for we are oblig'd to dine very early because after Dinner we are to make a formal Visit to a Neighbour Lady but we shall leave  Isabella  to entertain you You may imagine I felt no little Joy when I understood  Isabella  was to be left behind and the Freedom of my Humour had almost betray'd my Contentment for I was rally'd both by the Mother and Aunt Nay my Uncle cou'd not help having a Fling at me Why good Ladies said my Uncle don't be too hard upon my Nephew do you imagine a young Lad past Fifteen cares a Fig for Womens Company looking hard towards Forty No no it's very seldom Youth and Age can agree except  Youth is very sober indeed or Age is not tinctur'd with its old Distemper Peevishness with a Hatred of all Mirth Ay but I reply'd we find nothing of that in this good Company there's none here forgets they were once young Very true return'd the Mother your Uncle I believe imagines he is as young now as he was thirty Years ago Pray speak for yourself Madam return'd my Uncle you are as unwilling as I am to be reckon'd in the Catalogue of Old Why sure reply'd the Aunt my Sister has not quite so many Years over her Head as your Worship No nor so much Experience neither return'd my Uncle Dinner coming in ended this Dispute And after it was over the Mother and Aunt went to their several Chambers to dress and my Uncle went to sleep in the SummerHouse so I was left alone with the divine  Isabella  We said all our young Hearts conceiv'd and I thought myself the happiest of Mortals But when I touch'd upon my Absence for so long a time she begg'd we might do something to divert that terrible Thought for if she gave herself leave to look into her Breast she was assur'd such a Torrent of Tears wou'd follow that her Sorrow wou'd be taken Notice  of by the Company and perhaps the Cause of Grief surmis'd if not in reality found out Therefore said she to divert the Thought let us play a Party at Picquet My Uncle Madam I reply'd will not forgo his Afternoon's Nap for any thing therefore we must play by ourselves Before we had play'd out one Game the Ladies came down and the Coach being ready drove away to their Visit  When they were gone I cou'd not refrain opening my whole Soul to  Isabella  who felt the Pangs of Parting as sharp as myself and her lovely Face was all bedew'd with Tears We were so long in this tender Scene of Parting that my Uncle had finish'd his Sleep and was coming towards us  Isabella  at the Sight of him was oblig'd to retire to hide her Tears and I was forc'd to have Recourse to  Otway  's  Orphan  to have a Pretence for the Gloom that was settled upon my Countenance Why how now young Man said my Uncle when he enter'd what all alone and melancholy Yes Sir said I I never can read the last Act of this Play without being sensibly touch'd with the Catastrophe Pr'ythee read Comedies then said my Uncle for I will not have you sad  Sir said I I can't find many Comedies fit to read for those that are good I have read so often I'm as well acquainted with them as the Authors or Actors in them What's become of the young Lady said my Uncle have you not Rhetorick enough to keep her here So it seems Sir said I for she is retir'd Well then said my Uncle since we are alone and the Time short we shall be together let me give you a little Advice before we part for it is not an Improbability when we part we may part for ever I find Sir said I you intend to increase my Melancholy for if I thought that by my Consent we wou'd never part Never the nearer Death for talking of it neither return'd my Uncle But what I am going to say to you I wou'd have you often think on to strengthen your Mind in Virtue  When you have chang'd your Climate don't change your Nature but always think  England  your native Country and not like some young Gentlemen that I know who return with a Contempt for their own Country with their Understandings like a Fool's Coat patch'd all over and nothing of the Ground seen Never stay long at a Place for even  Rome  with the Help of Books  which describe their Antiquities may be seen in three Months as well as so many Years Converse with elder People than your self for their Knowledge will increase yours and do not as I know some of our Countrymen do because they are brought up in the Protestant Religion avoid all Conversation with the Clergy abroad for when I travell'd I found among all their Holy Bodies Men of the profoundest Learning and Judgment who never attempted to make me a Proselyte or gave me any Uneasiness about my Religion I wou'd have you go into all Companies but take care of being too particular Make no Intimates but as many Friends as you can The  French  have too much Levity the  Spaniards  too much Moroseness the  Italians  too much Jealousy and addicted to overmuch Pleasure without Mirth the  Germans  tho' learned love the Juice of the Grape too well and the  Dutch  are all Men of Business tho' there is no general Rule without an Exception Always live soberly for as you will be frequently changing Place a spare Diet will best agree with your Constitution and will learn you never to be disappointed If Heaven shou'd afflict you with Sickness take my Method  Send for the most eminent of the Profession tell him your Stay in that Place is but short and agree with him for such a Sum when you are thoroughly cur'd This Management will make it his Interest to set you upon your Legs as fast as he can You must hire a Native Servant at every Place you intend to make any Stay at Give him good Wages but trust him not let him know as little of your Affairs as possible and keep him ignorant of your next Station and the Time you intend to set forth for some of 'em I have prov'd are Confederates with Robbers and are as inquisitive after Foreigners as some Foreigners are after new Fashions The Variety of Dress I mean Fashions is what I abhor yet you must put yourself in the Garb of every Place you make any Stay at It will not only prevent your being gaz'd at but will ingratiate you with the Natives when you take their Habit upon you Hear much and speak little Be not too intimate with the  Feminine Gender  for an Intimacy there too often creates Discontent and Trouble Be very cautious in making Acquaintance with your own Countrymen for most of 'em nowaDays enter into Society to enter into all the fashionable Vices of the Places  they go thro' Be like the industrious Bee suck Honey from every Flower and contemn the gaudy Weeds that bloom and flourish to no Use Avoid all Quarrels but if you shou'd unhappily fall into one behave your self with Courage and Resolution and if you shou'd succeed don't let your Sword hang the looser in its Scabbard A Man of true Spirit will be as cautious how he draws his Sword as he wou'd be of treading in the Dark over Heaps of Ruins Be cau  ious of every one you deal with for in many Places they make it a common Practice to overreach Foreigners and the fairer their Looks often the fouler their Hearts Whenever you come to have your Equipage examin'd by Officers of the Customs make a handsome Present beforehand which will either prevent their giving you any Trouble or at least will prevent their tumbling your Things which often proves of more Damage than the Present you make 'em comes to When you go by Sea as you must to arrive at several Places of  Italy  bargain with the Master of the Vessel before you imbark but pay him not before you arrive at the End of your Voyage nor then till all your Things are brought to your Lodgings to answer your  Bill of Parcels and be sure you have two drawn at the same time one for the Master and the other for yourself When you are to imbark if you can get a Recommendation from the last Place you leave or if you cannot enquire out some  Englishman  for there is no fear of finding 'em at all the noted Places and beg he wou'd recommend you to some Native of the Place where you may reside for I have often made it my Observation to have more Respect shewn me when I took up my Quarters at one of the Natives than when I did at one of my own Countrymen's Tho' it is possible I may get you several recommendatory Letters One I am sure of from the worthy Person that we receiv'd a Letter from this Morning concerning your new Tutor he was Envoy at  Florence  two Years and has a good Acquaintance in several Courts of  Europe  Now said my Uncle giving me a Paper here is written the Heads of what I have been speaking which I wou'd have you read over once a Week And I desire I may hear from you all Opportunities with a succinct Account of every thing worth Notice you see abroad It will serve to kill some Part of your Time that may hang heavy on your Hands Besides it will be acceptable to me  We had several other Discourses on the same Subject but we were interrupted by the Arrival of the Mother and Aunt They got into a Chat no way agreeable to me of their Visit which gave me an Opportunity of looking after my dear  Isabella  who I had observ'd some time before to go into the Garden I found her in a by SummerHouse bathing her lovely Cheeks in Tears When she saw me she strove to dry her Eyes but freely confess'd the Thoughts of Parting had rais'd that Sorrow in her She told me various Objects and Climates might alter my young Heart and wipe her out from thence It was with much Persuasion I cou'd settle her Mind to talk of any thing else and tho' it gave me unconceivable Transports to see the Strength of her Love yet it was necessary we shou'd have some time to settle our future Correspondence by Letter When that was finish'd I took my solemn leave of her not without shedding Tears at our tender Separation But poor  Isabella  's Grief quite overcame her she fainted in my Arms The tender Proof of her Heart however gave me some Uneasiness left we shou'd be discover'd for it was some time before she came to herself When we had compos'd ourselves  as well as we cou'd we were troubled to find a Means or Pretence for  Isabella  's Tears for there was no concealing her Grief from the Company within At last she told me she wou'd make 'em believe a Bee had stung her Hand  We went with some Confusion into the Parlour where they were sitting  Isabella  was soon discover'd to have been weeping When she was ask'd the Cause she told 'em as she went to pluck a Rose a Bee conceal'd had stung her I thought you had more Philosophy reply'd my Uncle young Lady than to shed Tears for Pain Truly Sir said she I shall never be so much a Stoick to think Pain is all Fancy for I am sure I feel it still Well reply'd my Uncle you find young Lady the sweetest thing sometimes conceals a Sting However your Pain will not hold you long there is a Balm to cure it Honey and a little Time will soon ease you I warrant you A while after my Uncle order'd me to take my last Leave of the good Company which I did with ten thousand Pangs But as I prest my Lips to those of my dear  Isabella  's I found 'em tremble so much that I fear'd a Discovery yet she bore it outwardly very well but did not come out to  see us to the Coach tho' no one took Notice of it but myself 'Twas well the Dusk of Evening was approaching for the Concern in my Countenance was not to be conceal'd however I compos'd myself as well as I cou'd before we came home  The next Morning the Gentleman that was to be my Tutor arriv'd and I must confess I took an Affection to him at first Sight His Countenance pleas'd me as well as his Behaviour and my Uncle seem'd as well pleas'd as myself He was not above Five and Twenty and tho' young enough for a Tutor yet we found him old in Experience and Understanding and answer'd fully the Character the Letter gave my Uncle of him My Uncle was so well assur'd of his Abilities that he resolv'd we shou'd begin our Journey in two Days In the mean time I wrote several Letters to my dear  Isabella  and receiv'd Answers so tender and passionate that my Heart felt all the Joy it cou'd desire but that Joy was lost in the dismal Thoughts of being separated from all my Soul held dear so long  At length the Day came we were to set out My dear Uncle wou'd accompany me to  Dover  where we arriv'd But the Weather proving a little boisterous he wou'd not let  me imbark before it was settled tho' the Vessels set Sail as not regarding it however as it was his Tenderness and GoodNature I comply'd with his Desire tho' there was no apparent Danger  The Sight of the Cliffs of  Dover  put me in mind of those Lines in  King Lear  of our inimitable  Shakespear  How fearful  And dizzy 'tis to cast one's Eyes below  The Crows and Choughs that wing the midway Air  Shew scarce so big as Beetles Half way down  Hangs one that gathers Samphire dreadful Trade  The Fishermen that walk upon the Beech  Appear like Mice And you tall anchoring Bark  Seems lessen'd to her Boat her Boat a Buoy  Almost too small for Sight The murmuring Surge  That on th' unnumber'd idle Pebbles b  ats  Cannot be heard so high I'll look no more  Lest my Brain turn and the Disorder makes me  Fall headlong down  The next Day the Weather prov'd so calm that the Sea look'd like polish'd Glass or as the Sailors say  so smooth you might throw Dice upon't  therefore my Uncle after mingling our Tears gave me leave to embark with my Tutor and one Servant and we left the  British  Shore behind  End of the First Volume
