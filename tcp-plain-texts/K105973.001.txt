 A TOUR  IN  WALES  MDCCLXXIII  CAERGWRLE CASTLE  LONDON Printed by Henry Hughes MDCCLXXVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THESE hometravels are the first part of an account of my own country and were actually performed in the year mentioned in the title page The world justly loves the reality therefore this is mentioned to satisfy the public that they are not formed out of tours undertaken at different periods  THESE make of themselves a complete tour of the tamer parts of our country In a future volume the wild and romantic scenery will be presented inter∣mixed with the rich vallies so frequently interspersed To this will be added an Appendix containing the sub∣jects referred to in this volume with variety of other mat∣ter I implore the aid of my countrymen to assist me in the attempt and to favor me with the necessary mate∣rials They will see that great part of  Denbighshire  and all parts of the four remaining counties of our principality are still to be described My frequent  journies through them render me a tolerable master of their topography I look up to my friends for history and anecdote latent among their papers or references to our writers least any facts lodged in books might escape my memory  AMONG the gentlemen I am chiefly indebted to for information respecting the present work I cannot pass unthanked  PHILIP YORKE  Esq  of  Erddig  JOHN MYTTON  Esq  of  Halston

ear∣liest history for its valour and tenacity of its liberty for the stand it made against the  Romans  for its slaughter of the legions  Vita Agricolae  and for the subjection of the nation by  Agricola  who did not dare to attempt his  Caledonian  expedition and leave behind him unconquered so tremendous an enemy  WHEN our first invaders landed in  Great Britain North Wales  was possessed by the  Ordovices  a name derived from the language of the country signifying the situation being almost entirely bounded by the river  Deva  or the modern  Dee  and another river of the name of  Dyvi  Mr  Llwyd  in  Cambden  II  The one flows into the  Irish  sea below  Chester  the other into the same sea on the borders of  Cardi∣ganshire  THE spirit which the people shewed at the beginning did not desert them to the last Notwithstanding they were obliged  to submit to the resistless power of the  Romans  they never fell a prey to the enervating charms of luxury as the other nations of this island did They never with womanish invocations requested the aid of the deserting conquerors or sunk beneath the pressure of the new invaders they preserved an undaunted courage amidst their native rocks and received among them the gallant fugitives happy in congenial souls The hardy  Saxons  for above three centuries could not make an impression even on our low lands  Offa  was the first who extended his kingdom for some miles within our borders His conquest was but temporary for we possessed  Chester  the capital of the  Cornavii  till the year when it was wrested from us by the united force of the Heptarchy beneath the able  Egbert  This indeed reduced our confines but did not subdue our spirit With obdurate valour we suftained our independency for another four centuries against the power of a kingdom more than twelve times larger than itself and at length had the glory of falling when a divided country beneath the arms of the most wise and most warlike of the  English  mo∣narchs  I NATURALLY begin my journey from the place of my nativity  FLINTSHIRE  Downing  in the county of  Flint  To give a general idea of this shire the reader must learn that it is lest of the twelve  Welch  Its northern side is washed by the estuary of the  Dee  the  Seteia Estuarium  of  Ptolemy  The land rises suddenly from the shore in fine inequalities clayey and plenteous in corn and grass for two three or four miles to a montanous tract that runs parallel to it for a confiderable way  THE lower part is divided by picturesque dingles which run from the mountains and open to the sea filled with oaks The inferior parts abound with coal and freestone the upper with minerals of lead and calamine and immense strata of lime∣stone and chert The principal trade of the country is mining and smelting  The northern part of the county is flat and very rich in corn especially wheat which is generally exported to  Liverpool  The shire in most places raises more than is sufficient for the use of the inhabitants It is extremely populous and in the mine∣ral parts composed of a mixed people whose fathers and grand∣fathers had resorted here for sake of employ out of the  English  mine counties many of whose children born of  Welsh  mothers have quite lost the language of their fathers  A LOFTY range of mountains rise on the west and form a bold frontier Our county is watered by several small rivers such as the  Allen  the  Terrig  and the  Wheeler  part of its western boundary by the  Clwyd  and  Maelwr  a disjoined part of the country by the DEE  WE are ignorant of the classical name of this little province The  Ordovices  of which all west of  Cheshire  was part were subdivided in the time of the  Romans  in all probability as the rest of the country was They had  Reguli  or Lords who ruled over little districts and united under a common leader when the exigencies of the time required These factions weakened the state separated their interest and facilitated their conquest by the first invaders  THE names of these districts are now unknown  Gwynedd  is the most antient we are acquainted with for the country of  North Wales  The portion I inhabit was called  Tegangle  which com∣prehends the  hree modern hundreds of  Coleshill Prestatyn  and  Rudland  The name is preserved in the montanous parts of this parish and some others to this day called  Mynnydd Tegang  I reject the translation of  Tegangle  into  Fair England  as a mongrel compound The word is of a much more antient date it be∣ing derived from  Cangi  or  Ceangi  a set of people according to the learned  Baxter  belonging to every  British  nation who at∣tended the herds and resided with them in different grazing grounds at different times of the year The neighboring  Cornavii  had their  Ceangi  who wintered in  Wiral  and took their summer residence in  Tegangle  a word to be properly derived on that account from  Teg  fair  Cang  the name of the people and  Lle  a place To corroborate which at this very day is a plain in the parish of  Caerwys  a part of the old  Tegangle  adjoining to this mountain that still retains the title of  Maes can havod  or the plain of the hundred summer residences For this reason I presume to differ from Mr  Baxter  in his notion of the sum∣mer residence of these  Cangi  He places it near the  Canganorum Promontorium  or  Braich y pwll  head in  Caernarvonshire  but those were the  Cangi  of the  Ordovices  these of the  Cornavii  IT may be remarked that contrary to what happens to most subdued nations our country preserved its own language and the conquerors even deigned to adopt the names of the  British  towns and people latinizing them from the original words Thus  Londinium  from LUNDEIN  i e  LLONG DIN or  DINAS  the city of ships  Cambden I  from its considerable commerce DEVA from its situation on the river  Deva  Or  Dysi  DUNMONII from  Dun∣mnyn  or  the hill of ore  BRIGANTES from  Brig  choice or chief men  Coritani  or rather  Coitani  from  Coed  a wood  Mr Pegge  On the retreat of their  Roman  masters the latinized names were dropt except in a very few instances and their own resumed but the rest of the  Britons  who submitted to the  Saxon  yoke uni∣versally received with it the names of places from their con∣querors  THE whole of  Flintshire  was subdued by the  Saxons  immediately after the taking of  Chester  by  Egbert  It was an open country destitute of inaccessible rocks and mountains like the rest of  North Wales  and consequently incapable of defence against so potent an enemy The conquerors as usual newnamed the towns villages and hamlets but could not cancel the antient Thus  Hawarden  still is known to the  Welsh  by the name of  Pen∣nardd Lâg  or  Halawg Mold  by that of  Wyddgryg  and  Hope  by that of  Estyn  which with the continuance of our language to this day proves that even at that time it mixed but little with our conquerors Numbers of  Saxons  were settled among us who held their lands from the  Mercian  governors or earls we find in the Doomsday book many of their names who had possessions in this tract such as  Ulbert Osmer  and  Elmer  THE first notice of any subdivision of the tract called  Flint∣shire  DOOMSDAY BOOK  appears in the  Doomsday  book When that survey was taken it was made a part of  Cheshire  to which it was considered as  an appendage by conquest Old records affirm that  the county of  FLINT  appertaineth to the dignity of the sword of  CHESTER It was soon subdued by  Robert de Rothelent  commander in chief under  Hugh Lupus  who carried his arms far into  Wales  and secured his conquests in the marches by building or rather by adding new works to the castle of  Rudland  which he had wrested from one of our princes  THE tract from  Chester  to the  Clwyd  was then considered as a hundred of  Cheshire  and called in the Doomsday Book  Atiscros  hundred Numbers of places still existing are mentioned in it disguised often by the  Norman  spelling  Whiteford  the place in question is called  Widford  notice is also taken of some of the present townships such as  Tremostyn Trebychton  and  Merton  under the names of  Mostone Widsord Putecaine  and  Meretone  MOSTONE was then a  ploughland terra unius Carucae  It had on it four villeyns and eight boors  Bordarii  Borda signifies a cottage with a small piece of land annexed held by the service of finding for the lord poultry eggs  c  for his  bwrdd  or table  a wood a league long and forty perches  particatae  broad and was valued at twenty shillings  WIDFORD is joined with  Putecaine  The first seems to have com∣prehended our present  Trelan  or the place where the churchvillage now stands These had one ploughland two villeyns and twelve others between men and maid servants fisheries and a wood half a league long and forty perches broad the value was the same with that of  Mostone  WITH  Meretone  is joined the third part of  Widford  and the  Berewicha  or hamlet of  Caldecote  the last at present a township  of the parish of  Holywell  In this division was a presbyter a church and six villeyns Here was a wood half a league long and twenty perches broad One  Odin  held these of the earl  AT the time of the conquest all this tract of  Flintshire  which was called by the  Saxons Englefield  and afterwards by the  Nor∣mans Atiscros  was in possession of  Edwin  the last Earl of  Mercia  and on his defeat and forfeiture bestowed with the earldom of  Chester  on  Hugh Lupus  The whole was in a manner depopu∣lated and reduced to a waste I imagine by the two inroads made into those parts by  Harold  at the command of  Edward  the confessor to revenge on  Griffith ap Lhewelyn  the insult offered him by giving protection to  Algar  one of his rebellious sub∣jects  Powell      It is observable that there were only seven churches at that time in the whole hundred  Haordine  the present  Hawardin    Widford    Bissard Boteuuaral  and  Ruagor    Inglecroft Brunfor  and  Alchene    Danfrond Calston  and  Wesbie    Pres∣tetone  and  Ruestoch  and finally the th at  Roelend  besides one that lay waste at  Cancarnacan  and  Whenescol  Parochial divisions had not yet taken place Mr  Agard  Antiquary Discourses I  a writer in the latter end of the sixteenth century remarks that the old historians make no mention of either parishes parsons vicars incumbents or curates The people attended in those days either the cathe∣dral churches or the conventual which were served by the prelates or monks and those often assisted by presbyters clerks  and deacons As piety gained strength other churches for the conveniency of the devout were erected by the no∣bility and men of property who were desirous of spiri∣tual assistance within their precincts and to this were owing the churches which at the period in question were so spar∣ingly scattered over the land The places which enjoy∣ed this advantage had the title of  Lhan  prefixed as that of  Tre  which signifies primitively a habitation is to the town∣ships  THUS in our parish is  Tremostyn  TREMOSTYN  remarkable for the antient seat of the family of the same name which acquired it by the marriage of  Jevan Vychan  with  Angharad  heiress of  Howel ap Ithel Vychan  of  Mostyn  in the reign of  Richard  II The great gloomy hall is of very old date furnished with the high  Dais  or elevated upper end and its long table for the lord and his jovial companions and another in the side the seat of the inferior partakers of the good cheer The walls are furnished in a suit∣able manner with antient militia guns swords and pikes with helmets and breast plates with funereal atchievements and with variety of spoils of the chace A falcon is nailed against the upper end of the room with two bells hung to each foot With these incumbrances it flew from its owner a gentleman in the county of  Angus  on the morning of the twentyfourth of  September  and was killed near this house on the morning of the twentysixth The precise time it reached our country is not known therefore we are uncertain whether this bird exceeded in swiftness the hawk which flew thirty miles in an hour in pursuit of a woodcock or that which made a flight out of  Westphalia  into  Prussia  in a day instances recorded  Miscellany Tracts Tr V p  by the learned Sir  Thomas Brown  The adjacent kitchen is overlooked by a gallery leading to the antient apartments of the lady of the house at a period when the odours of the pot and spit were thought no ill savours At one end of the gallery is a great room remarkable for a singular event During the time that  Henry  earl of  Richmond  was secretly laying the foundation of the overthrow of the house of  York  he passed concealed from place to place in order to form an interest among the  Welsh  who favored his cause on account of their re∣spect to his granfather  Owen Tudor  their countryman While he was at  Mostyn  a party attached to  Richard  III arrived there to apprehend him He was then about to dine but had just time to leap out of a back window and make his escape through a hole which to this day is called the  King  's  Richard ap Howel  then lord of  Mostyn  joined  Henry  at the battle of  Bosworth  and after the victory received from the King in token of gratitude for his preservation the belt and sword he wore on the day he also pressed  Richard  greatly to follow him to court but he nobly answered like the  Shunamitish  widow  I dwell among mine own people  The sword and belt were preserved in the house till within these few years It is observable that none of our historians account for a certain period of  Henry  's life previous to his accession It is very evident that he passed the times when he disappeared from  Bretagny  in  Wales  Many cotemporary bards by feigned names record this part of his life under those of the LION the EAGLE and the like which were to restore the  empire to the  Britons  for the inspired favorers of the house of  Lancaster  did not dare to deliver their verses in other than terms allegorical for fear of the reigning prince  THERE is little more remarkable about the house than what is common to others built at different times Here are two re∣markable portraits one of Sir  Roger Mostyn  knight with a white beard and locks in black with great breeches stuck round the waistband with points This piece of magnificence gave rise to a very coarse proverb applied to inferior people ambitious of acting beyond their station The other portrait is of his Lady  Mary  eldest daughter of Sir  John Wynne  of  Gwedir  baronet Both are full lengths dated and I think painted by  Mytens  HERE is another picture not less remarkable for its ridiculous composition than for the distinguished person painted in it A kitcat length of Sir  Roger Mostyn  the first baronet in a strange long flaxen wig a breastplate buff skirts and antique  Roman  sleeves a black holding his helmet his lady reading with one hand on a scull and by her husband a lapdog This gentle∣man was the most eminent loyalist of our county raised a regi∣ment in support of the crown consisting of fifteen hundred men in twelve hours time  Whitelock  mostly colliers and garrisoned his house which in  September  was surrendered to the parlemen∣tary forces with four pieces of cannon and some arms  Ibid    THE busts collected in  Italy  deserve mention  BUSTS  That of the elder  Brutus  is particularly fine as if formed in the instant that  the love of his country got the better of paternal affection when with a steady voice he was delivering to the lictors his  Titus  and  Tiberius  to receive the reward of their treasons  A BEAUTIFUL head of a young faun in a  Phrygian  bonnet  A FINE head of one of the  Cornelii  An  Homer  and an  Hip∣pocrates  A  Seleucus  with two wings fastened to an imperial dia∣dem symbols of dispatch and expedition Two busts in brown alabaster of a male and female faun with the  flammeum  on their heads both are of hideous deformity but well executed Here are besides a few small monumental marbles with inscrip∣tions which the antiquarian reader may find in the Ap∣pendix  IN the Library is a most elegant collection of the classics  LIBRARY  con∣taining variety of the most antient and rare editions a nume∣rous collection of books relating to the  Greek  and  Roman  anti∣quities especially those which comprehend the medallic history variety of manuscripts mostly on vellum and many of them richly illuminated In a few words scarce any private library can boast of so valuable an assemblage which remain indis∣putable evidences of the taste and judgment of that excellent man its accomplished founder the late Sir THOMAS MOSTYN The family are besides possessed of other very valuable anti∣quities such as the cake of copper found at  Caerhén  in  Caernarvonshire  the  Torques  This very curious antiquity is engraven in the Appendix with the account drawn up by my learned countryman  Llwyd  discovered near  Harlech  and the silver harp which the family had the power of bestowing on the most skilful minstrel rythmer or bard at the  Eisteddfad  or assem∣bly  held for trials of their several merits Each of these shall be spoken of in their proper places  BEFORE I quit the house I must take notice that  Thomas ap Richard ap Howel ap Jevan Vychan  Lord of  Mostyn  and his brother  Piers  founder of the family of  Trelacre  were the first that abridged their name and that on the following occasion  Rowland Lee  bishop of  Lichfield  and president of the marches of  Wales  in the reign of  Henry  VIII sat at one of the courts on a  Welsh  cause and wearied with the quantity of  aps  in the jury directed that the panel should assume their last name or that of their residence and that  Thomas ap Richard ap Howel ap Jevan Vychan  should for the future be reduced to the poor dissyllable  Mostyn  no doubt to the great mortification of many an antient line  IN the higher part of this township stands the curious cross called MAEN ACHWYNFAN  MAEN ACHWYN∣FAN  or  the stone of lamentation  because penances were often finished before such sacred pillars and concluded with weeping and the usual marks of contrition for an example near  Stafford  stood one called the  weeping cross  a name analogous to ours This is of an elegant form and sculpture is twelve feet high two feet four inches broad at the bottom and ten inches thick The base is let into another stone The top is round and includes in raised work the form of a  Greek  cross beneath about the middle is another in the form of St  Andrew  's and under that a naked figure with a spear in its hand Close to that on the side of the column is represented some animal The rest is covered with very beautiful fretwork like what may be seen on other pillars of ancient date in several parts of  Great Britain  MAEN Y CHYFAN  I do not presume after the annotator on  Cambden  has given up the point to attempt a guess at the age Only must observe that it must have been previous to the reign of gross supersti∣tion among the  Welsh  otherwise the sculptor would have employ∣ed his chizzel in striking out legendary stories instead of the elegant knots and interlaced work that cover the stone  THOSE who suppose it to have been erected in memory of the dead slain in battle on the spot draw their argument from the number of adjacent  tumuli  containing human bones and sculls often marked with mortal wounds but these earthy sepulchres are of more antient times than the elegant sculpture of this pillar will admit This likewise from the crosses is evidently a Christian monument The former were only in use in Pagan days  THERE are likewise  GILLI  near to it an antient chapel now a farm∣house called  Gelli  the name of an adjacent tract This might have relation to the cross as well as a place for performance of divine service to the abbot of  Basingwerk  who had a house at no great distance in one of our townships still called  Trérabbot  or the abbot's habitation This tract misspelt by the  English Getely  Ayloff  's Rotuli Walliae  with the wood at that time on it was granted by  Edward  I to the abbot and convent on the tenth of  No∣vember  at  Westminster  before the death of our last prince He also gave him power to grub up the wood which by the pre∣sent nakedness of the place appears to have been done ef∣fectually  FROM the summit of  Garreg  a hill in this parish the traveller may have an august foresight of the lofty tract of  Snowdon  from  the crooked  Moel Shabog  at one end to the towering  Pen∣maenmawr  at the other of the vast promontory of  Llandidno  and part of the isle of  Anglesea  with the great bay of  Llandulas  forming a vast crescent the estuaries of the  Dee  and the  Mersey  and to the north at times the isle of  Man  and the  Cumberland Alps  the sure presages of bad weather  I WILL descend now to  TreBychton  TREBYCHTON  another of our maritime townships where stands my paternal house attended with what was very frequent in our principality a summerhouse at a very small distance and a cellar beneath used as a retreat for the jolly owners and their friends to enjoy remote from the fair their toasts and noisy merriment This and the other lower parts of the parish are finely wooded with oaks which grow so spontaneously that was the place depopulated it would in a very few years relapse into an impenetrable forest  IN  Trelan  is the parishchurch dedicated to Saint  Mary  The rectory is a sinecure which with the vicarage is in the gift of the Bishop of St  Asaph  The church I imagine retains the antient site it had at the time of the conquest The present building consists of a nave and one aile The last was built by a  Blethyn Drow  of the house of  Mostyn  to whom that part belongs  THE two  Mertons  MERTON  Uch glan  and  Isglan  are adjacent townships In the reign of  Edward  I before his conquest the lands of the men of  Merton  to the amount of sixteen ploughlands were taken from them and bestowed on the abbot and convent of  Ba∣singwerk  against the laws of  Wales  and the custom of the country and contrary to the peace between the King and Prince  Lhewelyn  Pewel    This violent act was done by  Reginald de Grey  Dugdale's Baron  I    justice of  Chester  probably by connivance of the King to provoke the  Welsh  to commit some outrage that would give color to the  English  to break the truce  FOLEBROC  FOLEBROC  or  Feilebroc  belonged to the monks of  Basingwerk  and is mentioned in the confirmation of the grants to that con∣vent by  Henry  II and again in the charters renewed to it by  Lhe∣welyn ap Jorwerth  and  David ap Lhewelyn  princes of  North Wales  The monks had a grange on it and right of pa∣sturage on the mountain in common with neighboring in∣habitants  Dugdale's Monast  I      THE products of this parish are corn of every sort excepting rye Little cheese or butter is made here for sale as the grass is chiefly consumed by horses for the farmers are greatly em∣ployed in carrying the minerals of the country the same may be said of the shire in general Every cottager has his potatoe garden which is a great support to them and was a conveni∣ency unknown fifty years ago The lower parts are well wooded and much timber is at times sold to  Leverpool  and other places at good prices much is also used at home in the mines  THE collieries of  Mostyn  and  Bychton  have been worked for a very considerable space  COAL  and in the last century supplied  Dublin  and the eastern side of  Ireland  with coal They are at present but in a low state partly from the rise of the works at  Whitehaven  but more from the loss of the channel of the  Dee  which in the beginning of this century flowed so close to our shore that ships of two hundred tons lay under this parish with their  cables twisted round the trees At this time vessels of sixty or seventy cannot approach nearer than two miles the  Dee  now flowing under the opposite shore Still we load a few vessels for  Ireland  and some parts of  North Wales  Much is also consumed by the neighboring smeltinghouses and the inland parts of  Denbighshire  The improvements of land by lime has of late occasioned a great comsumption of coal by the farmer and by the persons who burn it for sale  THE coal is of different thickness from three quarters to five yards The beds dip from one yard in four to two in three They immerge beneath the estuary of the  Dee  are dis∣covered again on the south side of  Wiral  in  Cheshire  as if cor∣responding with some of the  Flintshire  they remain as yet lost on the northern part of the same hundred but are found a third time in vast quantities in  Lancashire  on the opposite side of the  Mersey  Their extent from west to east in this county may be reckoned from the parish of  Llanasa  through those of  Whiteford Holywell Flint Northop  and  Hawarden  Our coal is of diffe∣rent qualities suited to the variety of demands of the several sorts of founderies in the neighborhood Beds of canal are met with inferior indeed in elegance to those of  Lancashire  but greatly coveted by the limeburners Sometimes is also found the  Peacock  coal of Doctor  Plot  Hist Staffordshire  remarkable for the beauty of its surface glossed over with the changeable brilliancy of the colors of that beautiful bird  COALS were known to the  Britons  before the arrival of the  Romans  who had not even a name for them yet  Theophrastus  In his book on stones  describes them very accurately at lest three centuries before the time of  Caesar  and even says that they were used by workers in brass It is highly probable that the  Britons  made use of them It is certain they had a primitive name for this fossil that of  Glo  and as a farther proof I may add that a flintax the instru∣ment of the  Aborigines  of our island was discovered stuck in cer∣tain veins of coal exposed to day in  Craig y Parc  in  Monmouth∣shire  Ph Tr  N  o  p  and in such a situation as to render it very accessible to the inexperienced natives who in early times were incapable of pursuing the veins to any great depths The artless smelters of antient times made use of wood only in their operations as we find among the reliques of their hearths as shall be observed hereafter  A VERY useful species of ashcolored greasy clay is discovered over one of the beds It resists the fire remarkably well and has been used with great success in the mineral smelting fur∣naces  THE beds of sandstone are frequent in the lower parts of the parish  FREESTONE  and reach within half a mile of the mountain when the stratum changes first to a blackish shale soon dissolluble by exposure to the air after that to a whitish limestone or to a hard chert Both are found in strata a of vast thickness  LIME  the first is burnt into excellent lime and is also used as a flux for lead ores The common sort of houses are built with it for which it is less proper by reason of its excessive dampness at change of weather  IN the township of  Tremostyn  near the shore is a cliff of a very singular appearance looking like the semivitrified  lava  of a  volcano  The stratum is in front universally changed in its dispo∣sition and run into a horrible mass of red and black often porous but in all parts very hard In it is a hollow a vein in which was lodged the pyritical matter that took fire and caused the phaenomenon Its fury chiefly raged towards the front and diminished gradually in the internal part of the bed which at some distance within land appears only discolored The stratum is a sandstone of the common sort  Da Costa's  Fossils    I am informed that these appearances are not uncommon in  Derbyshire  and that Mr  Ferber  an ingenions  Swede  and Mr  Whitehurst  our ingenious countryman hath taken notice of them in their writings  THE chert is the  petros  ex  of the later writers It is of a flinty nature  CHART  and is the only stone that resembles flint in our county The annotator on  Cronsted  justly remarks that the true flint abounds in chalk which is an absorbent earth as chert does in the neighborhood of limestone which is also calcareous As yet this species of stone has nor been found of any use I sus∣spect that in case it was burnt and ground it might prove serviceable in making a coarse stone ware as the nodular flints are in making the finer  THE hilly part of our parish has been for a long succession of years rich in minerals of lead and calamine Some years ago about seventeen hundred of copper ore was discovered but none since notwithstanding it has been diligently searched  Arenaria Saxatilis  Scarlet Mushroom  after I shall suspend enquiry after these and other minerals and fossils of this tract till I am about to leave the part of  Flint∣shire  productive of these sources of wealth I shall here only take notice of a vegetable rare in other places which grows on certain parts of the mountain in plenty and in  May  makes a pretty appearance with its white flowers This is the  arenaria saxatilis  or mountain chickweed engraven in the annexed plate with a scarlet kind of mushroom unnoticed by  Linnaeus  but described by Mr  Ray  p N  o  of his Synopsis of  British  Plants  IN my road to the next parish south of this I take that which lies on the shore and pass by the antient smeltinghouse of  Llanerchymor  which is still in use for fusing of lead ore and ex∣tracting of silver  THE sea or the estuary of the  Dee  lies at a small distance on the left a verdant marsh intervening The hundred of  Wiral  a portion of  Cheshire  is seen on the other side a hilly tract woodless and dreary chequered with cornlands and black heaths yet formerly was so well cloathed as to occasion this proverbial distich  From  Blacon  point to  Hilbree  A squirrel might leap from tree to tree  THE view of this branch of the sea terminates on one end with  Chester  and the rock of  Beeston  on the other with the two little islands of  Hilbree  or  Ilbre  On one had been a cell of  Benedictines  dedicated to our lady and depqndent on  Chester  This possibly was the hermitage called  Hilburghy  which in the  second of  Edward  III received ten shillings ayear from an old charity belonging to the castle at Chester  Janner    THE tides recede here so very far as to deny us any variety of fish The species most plentiful are of the flat kind such as flounders a few plaice small soles and rays Dabs visit us in  November  and in the last year was taken that rare species or flounder the  whiff  whose figure is given in the annexed plate The weever is very common here other species are taken ac∣cidentally  THE herring in this sea is extremely desultory At times they appear in vast shoals even as high as  Chester  arrive in the month of  November  and continue till  February  and are followed by multitudes of small vessels which enliven the channel Great quantities are taken and salted but are generally shotten and meagre It is now about ten years since they have paid us a visit  EXCEPTING the  Caryocatactes  or nutbreaker  Corvus Caryocatactes  Lin Syn de Buffon III Gesner Av Scopoli Kramer Br Zool II  I do not re∣collect any very uncommon bird to have visited this parish one of this species was killed in the garden at Mostyn in  Octo∣ber  Its native country is  Savoy Switzerland Lorraine  and some parts of  Germany  These birds do not regularly mi∣grate but in a certain period quit their usual habitations for example in  October  multitudes appeared in  Burgundy  and other parts of  France  The one that visited us was probably a strayed bird out of some flock that had quitted its native land It is a species of some beauty yet without variety or richness  WHIFF  of colors being spotted with triangular marks of pure white in rusty brown In size it is somewhat inferior to a jackdaw the bill very strong sharp and fitted for the piercing of trees which makes it very destructive to timber It inhabits the vast forests of firs from which it has been styled  Pica abietum guttata  Like the jackdaws it also nestles in lofty towers and like them is very noisy Its food is nuts which it breaks with its bill the cones of firs acorns berries and insects From the first circumstance the  Germans  have named it  nussbretcher  a name adopted in the  British  Zoology  ON crossing a little rill beneath the banks I enter the parish of HOLYWELL And very soon after cross its noted stream near its discharge into the estuary of the  Dee  On the right ascend to the site of the abby and castle of  Basingwerk  a place of importance in the wars be∣tween the  English  and the  Welsh  The land towards the sea is steeply sloped The west side was protected by a deep gully formed by the river the southeast by the vast ditch which has hitherto been universally supposed to have been that made by  Offa  king of the  Mercians  I owe the detection of that mistake to Mr  John Evans  of  Llwyn y Groes  This gentleman is now engaged in an actual survey of  North Wales  and of publishing a large map of that part of the principality a work extremely worthy of public encouragement A farther account of the plan will be printed in the last page of this volume  who proves it to be one  termination of another stupendous work of the same kind known by the name of  Wat  's ditch of which a full ac∣count will be given in some of the following pages with remarks on the mounts and other works that lie near its course  THE only vestige of this fortress appears in the foundation of a wall on the edge of  Offa  's ditch  BASINGWERK CASTLE  Lord  Lyttelton  Hist Henry  II d edit II  says that the founder was an earl of  Chester  I imagine that it must have been  Richard  son of  Hugh Lupus  and second earl of  Chester  and that the abby was fortified on the follow∣ing occasion for even religious institutions had no exemp∣tion  tempore necessitatis belli licitum est hospitari et incastellari in ecclesia  Innocentius  de immunitate ecclesiae quoted in Coll Curious Discourses I    ACCORDINGLY the first notice I find of it is in the life of St  Werburg  by  Bradshaw  who informs us that  Richard  on his return out of  Normandy  where he had been educated be∣gan his reign with an act of piety He attempted in a pilgrimage to the well of St  Wenefrede  but either in going or returning was attacked by the  Welsh  and obliged to take shelter in  Basingwerk  He applied to St  Werburg  for relief who miraculously raised certain sands between  Flintshire  and  Wiral  and thus gave means to his constable to pass to his assistance which sands from that time were called the  Constable's Sands Bradshaw  styles the place of his retreat an abby a proof that here had been a religious community before the time usually  assigned for the foundation of this house I must also draw from Lord  Lyttelton  's authority for I can find no other that this castle was demolished by the  Welsh  in the reign of  Stephen  Hist Henry II    HENRY II in after his escape from the ambuscade of  Eulo  left  Basingwerk  restored well fortified and manned  MParis  in order to secure a retreat on any future disaster He did the same by the caste of  Rudland  In his days the inland parts of our county were a dangerous wild of forest After his defeat he never trusted himself among our woods but made his marches along the open shores  THE same monarch left another species of garrison  Powel  for he established here a house of knights templars a military order introduced into  England  in the preceding reign They were first instituted in the Holy Land for the protection of pilgrims and possibly  Henry  might have the same view in fixing them here to secure the  English  devotees in performing their vows to our neighboring saint who seems about this time to have come into reputation It is singular that these religious knights were allowed at their institution only one horse between two yet so greatly did they flourish that about the year or a hundred and fifty years after their institution the order had acquired in different parts of  Christendom  nineteen thousand manors  THIS castle was but of very short duration for in the gallant prince  Owen Gwynedd  laid siege to it took  The same  and levelled it to the ground after which the name occurs no more as a  Fortress I think at this period it belonged to  Hugh de Bello Campo  or  Beauchamp  on whom this and  Rudland  castle had been bestowed by the  English  monarch  Annales Waverleienses    THE abby  Called also by the  Welsh Maesglas  or  Greenfield    ABBY  of which there are some considerable remains was founded in according to the opinion of Bishop  Tanner  by  Randle  the second earl of  Chester  according to Bishop Fleet∣wood by  Henry  II For my part I believe it to be of greater antiquity but do not pretend to derive its origin No light into the matter can be collected from the charters preserved by Sir  William Dugdale  There are three of them either serving to confirm the antient donations or confer new in each is mention of the earl as a benefactor but there is not the left hint of his having been the founder I must attribute that honor to one of the princes of  Wales  for both  Lhewelyn ap Jor∣werth  and his son  David  in their respective charters recite that they give and confirm the several donations to GOD St  Mary  the monastery of  Basingwerk  and the monks which had been bestowed on them by their predecessors for the salvation of their souls  RANDAL was certainly a great benefactor for it appears that before his days the monks had only a chapel here From that period it became considerable and about that time part of the present buildings were erected for the conveniency of its inhabit∣ants who were of the  Cistorcian  order  THE architecture is mixed Here appears what is called  Saxon  having the round arches and short columns in some parts and the  BASINGWERK ABPRY  Gothic narrow slips of highpointed windows in others The first species had not fell out of use and the last was coming into fashion in the days of the first great benefactor  THE church lay on the east side but is now totally de∣stroyed The refectory is pretty entire and on one side has a great recess with two round arches and a plain in front  ABOVE were the cells for the lodgings of the monks with a small window to each  THE chapel of the knights templars is a spacious building The windows are long narrow and pointed the pilasters be∣tween them on the inside slender and elegant  THERE are some remains of offices used at present by a tanner Within less than fifty years much of the habitable part was standing and sometimes used by the worthy family the  Mostyns  of  Trelacre  a lady now living was born within the walls  DURING the preparations for the conquest of  Wales  by  Ed∣ward  I the abby was under the protection of the  English  There are extant two orders for the purpose providing that they had no commerce with what are styled the  Welsh  rebels  Ayloff's Rotuli Walliae  I imagine that the convent was firmly attached to the victor for I have been informed that there are among the lists of summons in the Tower writs for calling the abbot to parlement in the d th th d and th of  Edward  I  ACCORDING to the valuation of its revenues in the

be held by them as freely as  William Peverel  held the same in the time of  Henry  his grand∣father The same charter confirms the donations of  Ranulph  carl of  Chester  and other barons  viz Holywell Fulbrook  the chapel of  Basingwerst  the antient residence of the monks with the mills and their appertenances likewise  Holes  and a moiety of  Lecche  and one hundred shillings of the revenues of  Chester  the gift of the said earl  Calders  with its inhabitants and finally  Kethlenedei  the gift of  Robert Banastre  LHEWELYN AP JORWERTH prince of  Wales  and cotemporary with  Henry  III confirms all the donations of his ancestors particularly the site of their house the mill before their gate and the land before their doors which last was granted to them by  Ranulphus  and his brother  Aeneas  The same grant gives them also the land of  Meredeth Wawor  in  Holywell Ful∣brook  a community of pasturage on the mountains  Hanot de le Weceb  and  Creicgraft  with all their appertenances His son and successor  David  by another charter confirms the dona∣tions of his father and adds the lands of  Huttred  brother to  Meredeth Wawor  of  Holywell  the grange of  Fulbrook  the church of  Holywell  and the chapel of  C  lsul  and the land and pasturage  of  Gelli  before granted by his father He likewise empowers them to buy and sell every thing tollfree in all his territories for the use of their house Also the fifth part of the fish taken in his fisheries at  Rudland  and the tenth of the fish belonging to him in other parts He confirms to them all the village of  Wenhewm  with all its inhabitants and appertenances being the gift of  Howen de Porkenton  and confirmed by  Helyso  He at the same time confirms the lands and pasturage in  Penthlin  the gift of his father  THIS charter is dated from  Coleshill  in and witnessed by  Hugh  bishop of St  Asaph  and his chancellor the famous  Ednyfed Vychan  and others  TANNER  Notitia  mentions the tithes of  Blackbrook  and the wood of  Langdon  lands in  Chanclesworth  the manor of  West Kirkby  in  Cheshire  the silver mine near  Basingwerk  free warren in  Gethli Menegrange Ouregrange Beggerburgh  and  Holywell  THE abby also was possessed of the hospital or chapel of  Sponne  near  Coventry  which had been originally founded by  Hugh Ceveilioc  earl of  Chester  who probably bestowed it on these monks  Dugdale's Warwickshire I    THE revenues of the abbot amounted in the whole reckoning  rising from the mills lands cows and sheep to  l    s  Willis's St Asaph    IN the house and lands in the neighborhood were granted to  Henry ap Harry  whose only daughter  Anne  by her  marriage with  William Mostyn  esquire of  Trelacre  conveyed it into that family in which it now remains  I CANNOT recover the names of any more than two of the abbots both of the same with my own  Thomas ap Dafydd Pennant  presided over the house in the time of  Guttun Owain  a bard who flourished in the year and celebrates the hospitality of the abbot in some verses printed in the collection of Mr  Rhys Jones  The poet is so liberal of his praise as to say  That he gave twice the treasure of a king in wine  Er bwrw yno aur Brenin  Ef a roes deuswy a'r win  HE speaks also of his works of utility of the water and of the windmills he erected Neither is he silent on a subject pleasing to every  Welsh  ear the pedigree of his patron whom he derives from  Edwin  and from  Elidir ap Rhys Sais  a direct descendant from  Tudor Trevor  THE last abbot conformed and married  Angared  daughter to  Gwillim ap Gryssydd ap Gwillim  The  Harleian  MS calls him Sir  Thomas Pennant  The remains of a very antient oak still to be seen near the ruins of the house is called the abbot's and is supposed to be his cotemporary  THE road from hence is remarkably picturesque along a little valley bounded on one side by hanging woods beneath which the stream hurries towards the sea unless where interrupted by the fre∣quent manufactories Its origin is discovered at the foot of a steep hill  ST WENEFREDE'S WELL  beneath the town of  Holywell  or  Trefynnon  to which it gave the name The spring boils with vast impetuosity out of a rock  S  T  WENEFRED'S WELL MOSS SEAL  and is formed into a beautiful polygonal well covered with a rich arch supported by pillars The roof is most exquisitely carved in stone Immediately over the fountain is the legend of St  Wenefrede  on a pendent projection with the arms of  Eng∣land  at the bottom Numbers of fine ribs secure the arch whose intersections are coupled with some sculpture  SOME are mere works of fancy grotesque figures of animals but the rest allude chiefly to the  Stanley  family This building and the chapel over it rose from the piety of that great house who left these memorials of their benefactions there are besides some marks of illustrious donors for example the profile of  Margaret  mother to  Henry  VII and that of her husband the earl of  Derby  cut on the same stone  THE compliments to the  Stanlies  are very frequent The  wolf  's head is the arms of the earls of  Chester  it is inclosed in a garter in respect to Sir  William Stanley  knight of that order who had been chamberlain of that city and justiciary of  North Wales  The tun with a plant issuing out of it is a  rebus  the arms of his wife  Elizabeth Hopton  allusive to her name This proves that the building was erected before in which year Sir  William  lost his head The other badges of the same house are the stag's head the eagle's leg and the three legs the arms of the isle of  Man  WE also find that  Catherine  of  Arragon  widow to prince  Arthur  and afterwards the unfortunate wife of his brother  Henry  VIII was a benefactress to this building at lest her arms appear here three pomegranates in a shield surmounted with a crown the badge of the house of  Granada  in memory of the  expulsion of the Moors by her father  Ferdinand  Sandford's Geneal  The eagle seems also to belong to her being one of the supporters of the arms of her family  OVER one of the lesser arches on each side of the well are the dragon and grehound the supporters of the arms of  Eng∣land  during the reign of  Henry  VII and part of that of  Henry  VIII The first was born by  Henry  VII as a badge of the house of  Tudor  which derived itself from  Cadwalader  last king of  Britain  who bore on his ensign a red dragon  Henry  in imitation of him at the battle of  Bosworth  carried on his standard a red dragon painted on white and green silk which afterwards gave rise to the office of  Rouge dragon  among the heralds  ON one side of a wall that supports the roof was painted the tale of the tutelar saint at present almost defaced over it is inscribed  in honorem Sanctae Wenefredae  V M  IN another wall is an elegant nich in which stood a statue of the Virgin  Mary  pulled down as I have been informed in the year  I have also heard that there had been another of St  Wene∣frede  To grace the image on high festivals it is probable that  Isabel  countess of  Warwick  widow to the great  Richard Beauchamp  left to St  Wenefrede  in her gown of russet velvet  Dugdale's Warwickshire I    OVER this spring is a chapel  CHAPEL  of the same date with the other building a neat piece of gothic architecture but in a very ruinous state This had been a free chapel in the gift of the  bishop with the reserve of a stipend to the chapter but the rest of the offerings were to be expended on the chapel In  Richard  III's time the abbot and convent had from the crown ten marks  yerely for the sustentacione and salarie of a prieste at the chapelle of St Wynesride  Harleian  MSS  N  o    The chapel is the property of  John Davies  esquire of  Llanerch  The well is common for I find by a decision of the court of chancery on a lawsuit respecting the lordship of  Holywell  between Sir  John Egerton  knight and  John Eldred  chancellor  Ellesmere  decrees  That on calling to mind that within the said manor there is a fountain or well of antient and worthy memory he doth not think fit that the petitioner or any other should have the property thereof notwithstanding the general words of the grant of the manor and therefore his lordship doth order that notwithstanding the said grant that the well shall continue as now it is or heretofore hath been saving to the petitioner and his heirs and assigns the benefit of the stream and watercourse with the appertainances  THERE are two different opinions about the origin of this stream One party makes it miraculous the other assert it to be owing only to natural causes The advocates for the first deliver their tale thus  IN the seventh century lived a virgin of the name of  Wenesrede  OF SAINT WING FREDE  of noble parents her father's name was  Thewith  a potent lord in the parts where  Holywell  now stands her mother's  Wenlo  de∣scended from an antient family in  Montgomeryshire  and sister to  St  Beuno Beuno  assumed the monastic habit retired to  Clynnog  in  Caernarvonshire  where he built a church and founded a con∣vent After completing this work of piety he visited his rela∣tions in  Flintshire  and obtaining from his brotherinlaw a little spot at the foot of the hill on which he resided erected on it a church and took under his care his niece  Wenefrede  A neighboring prince of the name of  Cradocus  son of King  Alen  was struck with her beauty and at all events determined to gratify his desires He made known his passion to the lady who affected with horror attempted to escape The wretch enraged at the disappointment instantly pursued her drew out his sabre and cut off her head  Cradocus  instantly received the reward of his crime he fell down dead and the earth opening swallowed his impious corps  Hidgen  in his  Polychronicon  adds that even the descendents of this monster were visited with hor∣rible judgments to be expiated only by a visit to this well or to the bones of the saint at  Salop  Ad  Basingwerk  sons oritur  Qui satis vulgo dicitur  Et tantis bullis scaturit  Quod mox injecta rejicit  Tam magnum

Script III    THE severed head took its way down the hill and stopt near the church The valley which from its uncommon dryness was heretofore called  Sych nant  now lost its name A spring of uncommon size burst from the place where the head rested The moss on its sides diffused a fragrant smell  Life of St  Wenefrede  from which the materials for this part are mostly taken  Her blood spotted the stones which like the flowers of  Adonis  annually commemorate the fact by assuming colors unknown to them before  Luctus monumenta manebunt  Semper  Adoni  mei repetitaque mortis imago  Annua plangoris peraget simulamina nostri  For thee blest maid my tears my endless pain  Shall in immortal monuments remain  The image of thy death each year renew  And prove my grief to distant ages true  ST BEUNO took up the head carried it to the corps and offering up his devotions joined it nicely to the body which instantly reunited The place was visible only by a slender white line encircling her neck in memory of a miracle which surpassed far that worked by St  Dionysius  who marched in triumph after decapitation with his head in his hands from  Mont martre  to St  Dennis  's  Histoire de l'abbaye de St Denys  or that of St  Adelbertus  who in like circumstances swam across the  Vistula  TO conclude St  Wenefrede  survived her decollation fifteen years She died at  Gwytherin  in  Denbighshire  where her bones  rested till the reign of king  Stephen  when after divine admo∣nition they were surrendered to the abby of St  Peter  and St  Paul  at  Shrewsbury  The memory of the two great events that of her first death is celebrated on the d of  June  that of her translation the d of  November  A FRATERNITY and gild was established in honor of our faint at  Shrewsbury  It had its common seal which through the kindness of my friend Mr  Henry Levingston  is now in my pos∣session It is of copper of the form expressed in the plate In the centre is a representation of the martyrdom above is a cross in form of a T placed between the letters  T m  which mark the time when the fraternity was instituted during the abbacy of  Thomas Mynde  who was elected in and died in a period in which these religious societies were much in fashion The T or cross refers to the church of  St Cross  within this monastery Beneath are probably the arms of the house a sword and a key symbols of its tutelar apostles and round the mar∣gin is this inscription  sigillū cōe pfraternitat beate wenefride virginis  ī ecc̄īa sc̄e cruc ī fra monaster sc̄i petri salopie  A bell belonging to the church was also christened in honor of her I cannot learn the names of the gossips who as usual were doubtlessly rich persons On the ceremony they all laid hold of the rope bestowed a name on the bell and the priest sprinkling it with holy water baptized it in the name of the Father  c c  Stavely  's Hist Churches  He then cloathed it with a fine garment after this the gossips gave a grand feast and made great pre∣sents  which the priest received in behalf of the bell Thus blessed it was endowed with great powers allayed on being rung all storms diverted the thunderbolt drove away evil spi∣rits These consecrated bells were always inscribed The in∣scription on that in question ran thus  Sancta  Wenefreda  Deo hoc commendare memento  Ut pietate sua nos servet ab hoste cruento  And a little lower was another address  Protege Prece pia quos convoco virgo  Maria  AFTER her death her sanctity says her historian was proved by numberless miracles The waters were almost as sanative as those of the pool of  Bethesda  all infirmities incident to the human body met with relief the votive crutches the barrows and other proofs of cures to this moment remain as evidences pen∣dent over the well The saint is equally propitious to Protestants and Catholics for among the offerings are to be found these grateful testimonies from the patients of each religion  THE Holy Father gave all encouragement to the piety of pil∣grims to frequent this fountain Pope  Martin  V  Selden's  notes on  Michael Drayton  in the reign of  Henry  V furnished the abby of  Basingwerk  with pardons and indulgences to sell to the devotees These were renewed again in the reign of queen  Mary  by the interest of  Thomas Goldwell  bishop of St  Asaph  Powel  's notes on  Girald Cambr  Mr  Addison  says he saw his picture at  Ravenna  in the convent of  Theatins  among the eminent men of that order  who fled into  Italy  on the accession of  Elizabeth  Multitudes of offerings flowed in marks of gratitude from such who had received benefit by intercession of the virgin  THE resort of pilgrims of late years to these  Fontanalia  has considerably decreased the greatest number are from  Lancashire  In the summer still a few are to be seen in the water in deep devotion up to their chins for hours sending up their prayers or performing a number of evolutions round the polygonal well or threading the arch between well and well a prescribed number of times Few people of rank at present honor the fountain with their presence A crowned head in the last age dignified the place with a visit The prince who lost three king∣doms for a mass payed his respects on  August  th to our saint and received as a reward a present of the very shift in which his great grandmother  Mary Stuart  lost her head  The late Doctor  Copper  of  Chester  's MSS  The majority of devotees are of the fair sex attracted hither to com¦memorate the martyrdom of St  Wenefrede  as those of the East did the death of the  Cyprian  favorite  Whose annual wound in  Lebanon  allured  The  Syrian  damsels to deplore his fate  In woeful ditties all the summer's day  While smooth  Adonis  from his native rock  Ran purple to the sea supposed with blood  Of  Thammuz  yearly wounded  WE whose ancestors between two and three centuries ago abridged our faith to the mere contents of the Old and New Testament and to the creed called the  Apostles  do not think  the belief in the above and other legends requisite I refer the reader to the arguments used by the antiquary Doctor  Powel  in his notes on the Itinerary of  Giraldus Cambrensis  and to bishop  Fleetwood  's annotations on the life of the saint for proofs against the truth of the tale but with Protestants and temperate Catho∣lics it carries with it selfconfutation  THE waters are indisputably endowed with every good quality attendant on cold baths and multitudes have here experienced the good effects that thus result from natural qualities implanted in the several parts of matter by the divine Providence in order to fulfil his will Heaven for a short period deigned to convince a dark and obdurate age with a series of miracles which were de∣livered down to succeeding times as incontestible proofs of the reality of the divine mission Without them a sufficient ground of trust and reliance upon the Supreme Being has long since been established Second causes innumerable are dispersed throughout the universe subordinate to the FIRST Every element proves to us a medicine or a bane as suits His unerring dispensa∣tion We cannot want we cannot have the mediation of poor departed mortals The supposition would be bestow∣ing on them the attributes of the Deity omnipresence and omniscience  SOME eminent botanists of my acquaintance have reduced the sweet moss  MOSSES  and the bloody stains to mere vegetable produc∣tions far from being peculiar to our fountain The first is that kind of moss called a  Jungermannia  imperfectly described and figured by  Dillenius  in his history of mosses which has induced us to give a new engraving of it This species is also found in  another holy well in  Caernarvonshire  called  Ffynnon Llandeniolen  in a parish of the same name  THE other is a  Byssus  likewise odoriferous common to  Lap∣land  and to other countries besides our own It adheres to stones in form of fine velvet  Linnaeus  calls it  Byssus Jolithus  Sp Pl II Fl lap N  o    or the violetsmelling He says the stone to which it adheres easily betrays itself by the color being as if smeared with blood and if rubbed yields a smell like violets  Micheli  in his  Genera  of plants mentions the same  Gen tab fig  and  Schwenckselt  discovered it among the vegetables of  Silesia  He calls it a  muscus subrubeus  and informs us that the smell is grateful to the heart and that if put among cloaths it gives them a good scent and serves to drive away moths  Cat Stirp c Silesiae    Linnaeus  says  As quoted by Baron Halier N  o    that it is of use in eruptive disorders  ABOVE the well stands the church dedicated to St  Wenefrede  The parish wakes are celebrated in  November  the time of her translation The living before the dissolution belonged to the abby of  Basingwerk  and is a vicarage in the gift of  Jesus College Oxford  which nominates and  John Davies  esquire of  Llanerch  the layrector presents  ABOVE the church is a hill called  Bryn y Castell  narrow and very steep on the sides projecting at the end over the little valley On this might have stood the castle of  Treffynnon  or St  Wenefrede  built by  Randle  III earl of  Chester  in the year  Powel  There are not at present any vestiges left  IT is singular that no mention is made in the Doomsday book of either chapel church or well yet townships now of less note are named such as  Brunford Caldecote  and others Notwithstanding bishop  Fleetwood  's opinion I think the legend of St  Wenefrede  was known previous to that survey for the very name of  Holywell  is  Saxon  probably bestowed on it before the Conquest on account of the imputed sanctity of the well  THE spring is certainly one of the finest in these kingdoms and by the two different trials and calculations lately made for my information is found to fling out about twentyone tons of water in a minute It never freezes or scarcely varies in the quantity of water in droughts or after the greatest rains After a violent fall of wet it becomes discolored by a wheyey tinge  THE stream formed by this fountain runs with a rapid course to the sea which it reaches in little more than a mile's distance The industry of this century hath made its waters of much com∣mercial utility The principal works on it at this time are bat∣tering mills for copper a wiremill coarse paper mill snuff∣mill a foundery for brass and at this time a cotton manu∣factory is establishing the success of which will be an extensive blessing to the neighborhood  DURING the reign of pilgrimages nothing but a cornmill or two the property of the monks found employ for this bene∣ficial stream  THE town was also very inconsiderable till the beginning of this century the houses few and those for the most part  thatched the streets unpaved and the place destitute of a mar∣ket The flourishing mines that for some time were discovered in the neighborhood made a great change in the appearance and introduced the effects of wealth The town or rather township contains somewhat more than two thousand souls  THE monks of  Basingwerk  obtained for it the grant of a fair and a market The first has been dropt beyond the memory of man The market was also lost till it was renewed by letters patent dated  Jan  th granted to Sir  John Egerton  baronet The patent also contains a grant of three fairs  viz  on the d of  April  the  Tuesday  in  Easter  week and the d of  September  The market has been the most flourishing in  North Wales  but the fairs never could be established  THE situation of the town is pleasant and healthy On the back is a lofty hill at times extremely productive of lead ore Towards the sea is a pretty valley bounded by woods the end finishes on one side with the venerable abby To such who requ  e the use of a coldbath few places are more proper for besides the excellence of the waters exceeding good medical assistance and comfortable accommodations may be found here and the mind entertained and the body exercised in a variety of beautiful rides and walks  MY next visit was to  Flint  I took the lower road by the shore blackened with the smoke of smeltinghouses and in the more flourishing times of the collieries with vast stacks of coal The last township in  Ho  ywell  parish on this side is that of  Coleshill  COLESHILL  which gives name to a hundred and was so called from its abundance of foss  l fuel This place had at the  Conquest four villeyns two boors and a  Radman  This last seems to have been the same with the  Rod  or  Radknights  who by the tenure of their lands were bound to ride with or for their lord as often as his affairs required  AFTER crossing a small brook enter the town of FLINT  FLINT  a place laid out with great regularity but the streets far from being completed The removal of the greater and the lesser sessions and its want of trade will be farther checks to its improve∣ment This town gave name to the county which with that of  Caernarvon Merioneth  and  Anglesey  composed the four an∣tient  North Welsh  shires formed by  Edward  I immediately after the conquest of our principality I cannot assign any derivation of the word our county is totally destitute of the fossil usually so called I can only remark that it is purely  Saxon  and not∣withstanding it is not mentioned in the Doomsday book was called so before the Conquest  THIS place also seems to me to have been the same with what was named  Colsul  or  Coleshill  I can find no other site for the chapel of  Colsul  granted by  David ap Llewelyn  to the abby of  Basingwerk  The present  Flint  probably went at this period under both names There is no trace of any chapel in the neighborhood excepting this nor any other place of consequence enough to tempt our princes to live at It was called in the Doomsday book  Coleselt  and was possessed by  Robert  of  Rudland Edwin  held it from him and as a freeman Here was one hide of land taxable  THE whole place appears to have been founded in times of dan∣ger and every provision made against an attack from a people recently subdued and who had submitted reluctantly to a foreign yoke The town is formed on the principle of a  Roman  en∣campment being rectangular and surrounded with a vast ditch and two great ramparts with the four regular  portae  as usual with that military nation I shall hereafter give a conjecture of the probability of its having been a  Roman  station  THE public buildings within this precinct are the church the townhall and the jail not one of which is any ornament to this little capital The church or rather chapel is dedi∣cated to St  Mary  and is only a perpetual curacy under  Nor∣thop  I imagine this to have been the  capella de Colsul  Dugdale Monast I  belong∣ing to the abby of  Basingwerk  mentioned in the charter of  David ap Llewelyn  at lest I can trace no other  Flint  in that time was probably comprehended under the name of  Colsul  THE castle stands on a low freestone rock that juts into the sands a little northeast of the town and was once joined to it by a bridge which led to the outwork called the  Barbican  a square tower with a gateway now entirely demolished Within was a court surrounded with a ditch faced with a wall that joined by means of a drawbridge to the main fortress whose entrance for better security was little more than a postern  THE castle is a square building with a large round tower at three of the corners and a fourth a little disjoined from the other and much larger than the rest This is called the  double tower  FLINT CASTLE  It had been joined to the castle by a drawbridge and is of great thickness It has a circular gallery beneath vaulted with four arched openings into a central area a little more than twentytwo feet in diameter In one part the gallery is suddenly low∣ered and goes sloping towards the castle and then rising upwards makes a sort of communication with an upper gallery  THIS was the Keep or strong part of the castle and the same that the  French  call  le Dongeon  to which as  Froissart  informs us the unfortunate  Richard  II retired as the place of greatest security when he was taken by  Bolingbroke  THE channel of the  Dee  at present is at some distance from the walls but formerly flowed beneath There are still in some parts rings to which ships were moored  THE founder of this castle is uncertain  Cambden  attributes it to  Henry  II and his noble hisstorian  Lord  Lyttelton  is of the same opinion After his escape at  Euloe  it is possible that he might have begun a fortress here for security in future times that he might have left it incomplete and that it was finished by  Edward  I The rolls of the last reign mention the place several times  IN the year there was an order for proclaming a mar∣ket and fair to be held at  Flint  and the same was afterwards done through  Cheshire  and the cantreds of  Wales  IN appears an order for the custody of the gate of the castle of  Flint  Perhaps this might have been the year in which it was first garrisoned  IN the town received its first charter was made a free borough and the mayor sworn faithfully to preserve its liberties This is dated at  Flint  on the th of  September  it was confirmed again in the d and d years of  Philip  and  Mary  and afterwards in the th of  William  III  IN the burgesses also received a grant from  Edward  of timber out of the woods of  Northop Ledebroke  the greater and lesser  Keldreston Wolsynton Weper  and  Sutton  in order to smelt their lead ore and at the same time a right of pasturage in the same woods  IN there is an order for superintending the works of this castle and those of  Rudland  and  Chester  places of the first importance on the borders of a newconquered country  Rotuli  Walliae      THE first great event that occurs to me respecting this for∣tress is in the year when the  Welsh  wearied with the reitera∣tion of oppression as a signal of general insurrection surprized the place    at the same time that  David  brother of  Llewelyn  took  Hawarden  and  Rees  the son of  Malgon  and  Griffith ap Meredeth ap Owen  seized the castle of  Aberystwyth  Powel    HERE in the infatuated son of our conqueror received from exile his imperious favorite  Piers Gaveston  who had landed at  Caernarvon  from  Ireland  Stow    FROM this period I find nothing remarkable relating to this fortress till the year the th of  Edward  III when ap∣pears an order to the Black Prince as earl of  Chester  to take in  safe custody the castle of  Flint  and  Rudland  and to furnish them with men and provisions  Rotuli  Scotiae      Edward  in his th year had by charter granted to his gallant son the castles of  Chester Beeston Rudland  and  Flint  and all his lands there and also the cantred and lands of  Englefield  with all their appertenances to have and to hold to him and his heirs kings of  Eng∣land  Dodridge    IN this  dollorous castell  III  as  Halle  styles it was deposed the unfortunate monarch  Richard  II To this place he was inveigled by  Henry Percy  earl of  Northumberland  with the assurance that  Bolingbroke  wished no more than to be restored to his own pro∣perty and to give to the kingdom a parlement  Northumberland  with a small train first met  Richard  at  Conway  then on his re∣turn from  Ireland  The king distrusted the earl who to re∣move all suspicion went with him to mass and at the altar took an oath of fidelity The king fell into the snare pro∣ceeded with the earl for some time till he perceived about the precipice of  Penmain Rhôs  a large band of soldiers with the  Percy  banners The king would have then retired but  Nor∣thumberland  catching hold of his bridle forcibly directed his course The poor prince had just time to reproach him with his perjury telling him that the God he had sworn upon that morning would do him justice at the day of judgment  Carte II  He caused the king to dine at  Rudland  and conveyed him that night to  Flint  The next morning he was astonished with the sight of a numerous army commanded by his rival in full march  along the sands they soon surrounded the castle The prince descended from the  Keep  This place in old writers is called the  Dongeon  or  Donjon  according to SKINNER  Turris mu  ssima pr  pagnaculi ad ultimum receptum  but the word be∣ing now entirely applied to the miserable hole in which captives are confined I shall still retain the term  Keep  to meet  Bolingbroke  who fell on his knees and for a short space assumed a respectful appearance but he soon stung off the mask for 'with a high sharpe voyce' say Stow  the duke badde bring forth the kings horses and then two little nagges not worth forty franks were brought forth the king was set on the one and the earl of  Salisbury  on the other and thus the duke brought the king from  Flint  to  Chester  where hee was delivered to the duke of  Glocester  's sonne and to the earle of  Arundel  's sonne that loved him but a little for he had put their fathers to death who led him strait to the castle  Stow's  Annals    IF  Froissart  may be credited  Richard  did not experience the pang of ingratitude from man alone by a strange infection it seized the most faithful of the brute creation for his very dog deserted him and fawned on his rival  Bolingbroke  as if he understood and predicted the misfortunes of his old master The story is so singular that I shall relate it in the words of his noble translator Sir  John Bouchier  lord  Berners  Fol cccxii  who speaking of the transactions in  Flint  castle says  AND as it was enfourmed me kyng  Richarde  had a gray∣hounde called  Mathe  who alwayes wayted upon the kynge and woulde knowe no man els For whan so ever the kynge  dyd ryde he that kepte the grayhounde dyd lette hym lose and he wolde streyght runne to the kynge and fawne uppon hym and leape with his fore fete upon the kynges shoulders And as the kynge and the erle of  Derby  talked togyder in the courte the grayhounde who was wont to leape upon the kynge left the kynge and came to the erle of  Derby  duke of  Lancastre  and made to hym the same frendly countinaunce and chere as he was wonte to do to the kyng The duke who knewe not the grayhounde demaunded of the kynge what the grayhounde wolde do Cosyn

cherysshed the grayhounde who wolde never after folowe kynge  Richarde  but folowed the duke of  Lancastre  IN the insurrection of  Owen Glendwr Henry  prince of  Wales  procured from his father a pardon for several of his tenants in these parts who took up arms in the cause of our valiant countryman  Harlcian MSS N  o      THERE is another gap in the history till the troubles of the last century when this county took an active part in support of royalty  wn castle was garrisoned for the king after having  been repaired at the expence of Sir  Roger Mostyn  knight who was appointed governor In it was closely besieged by Sir  Wil∣liam Brereton  and Sir  Thomas Middleton  and was defended by the governor till all provisions even to horses failing he then surren∣dered it upon honorable terms  'THIS colonel  Mostyn'  says  Whitelock  is my sister's son a gentleman of good parts and mettle of a very antient family large possessions and great interest in that country so that in twelve hours he raised fifteen hundred men for the king  Whitelock    I MAY add that after a long imprisonment in the castle of  Conway  towards the conclusion of the war his circumstances were so reduced having spent sixty thousand pounds in the service of the crown he was obliged to desert his familyseat and live several years in an ordinary farmhouse  FLINT fell afterwards into the hands of the loyalists for under the year I find in the same historian that the garrison seemed inclinable to come to a treaty In  November  of the pre∣ceding year it had received that of  Beeston  which after a most gallant defence capitulated and was allowed to march with all the honors of war to this place  Rushworth part iv  But on the th of  August Flint  castle was surrendered to majorgeneral  Mytton  and in was with other  Welsh  castles dismantled by order of the house directed to the general for that purpose  Idem Ibid    ON the restoration it was resumed by the crown among its other rights in which it still continues The crown governs it  by a constable who is likewise mayor of  Flint  These offices are at present filled by my friend  Owen Brereton  esquire  THE town in conjunction with  Caerwys Rudland Caergwrley  and  Overton  sends a member to parlement The election is made by the inhabitants paying parochial taxes and the return made by the two bailiffs of  Flint  appointed by the mayor The borough land of this town extends over the whole parish and also the township of  Coleshill  in the parish of  Holywell  THE  Welsh  boroughs and counties received the privilege of representatives by act of parlement of the th of  Henry  VIII  THIS town with the county was an appendage to the earldom of  Chester  The following schedule gives us their revenues as they stood in the th year of  Edward  III     £  s  d  The profits of the manor of  Hope  and  Hopedale        of the manor of  Eulo  and the coalmines        of the office of constable of  Rudland  whereof he was

stood a cross whose pedestal I remember which was called  Atiscross  ATISCROSS  and the land around is still called Croesati This probably was a place of note for at the Conquest it gave name to a very considerable hundred at that time considered as part of  Cheshire Exestan  was another now given to  Flintshire  which will be noticed in its place  THERE is a tradition that in very old times there stood a large town at this place and it is said the foundations of build∣ings have been frequently turned up by the plough But what is most remarkable is the great quantities of scoria of lead bits of lead ore and fragments of melted lead discovered in several spots here and along the country just above the shore in the adjoining parish of  Northop  These have of late been dis∣covered to contain such quantities of lead as to encourage the washers of ore to farm the spots In this tract numbers of tons have been gotten within a small time especially at  Pentre  FFWRNDAN or the  place of the fiery furnace  a name it was al∣ways known by and which evinces the antiquity of smelting in  these parts but this etymology was never confirmed till by means of these recent discoveries  In page I mentioned my suspicion that the precinct of  Flint  town once served to inclose a small  Roman  station I am confirmed in my opinion from the multitudes of  Roman  coins  Fibulae  and variety of antique instruments lately discovered by the workmen in the old washes of this and the next parish which prove that the  Romans  made this their port for exporting the metal after it was fused from the ore of the adjacent mountains Here might be placed a small garrison to protect the antient smelters or to collect the duties or to receive the tribute of metal Previous to the settlement of the  Romans  in  Britain Strabo  speaks  Lib iv p  so slightly of our articles of commerce as to say they were not worth the expence of one legion and a few horse He died in the year before our country was scarcely known except by the attempt of  Caesar  But the trade both in his days and those of that great geographer was carried on merely by exchange The  Britons  worked their own mines of tin and lead and in their room received from the foreign mer∣chants earthen ware salt and works of brass  Idem lib iii p    IN a small time after the  Romans  had carried their arms through our island they began to apply with vigor to the working of the mines At first the ore of lead was got with ease it offered itself on the surface In  Spain  and  Gaul  much labor was required to dig it up in  Britain  it was found near the common soil  Plinii  Hist Nat xxxiv c  and in such quantities that in  Pliny  's time  who died in the year there was a law as there is at present in respect to black lead limiting the annual produce  Pliny  lib xxxiv c  Chance was the general detector of metallic riches in early times The gold mines of  Galicia  were discovered by the plough  Justin  lib xliv c  those

age have been the cause of mighty mineral discoveries The great mine at  Halkin  was discovered by ditching that at  Llangynnog  in  Montgomeryshire  by the slip of a woman ascending a hill and baring the vein with her feet Many of the works that we suspect to have been  Roman  are very shallow generally in form of trenches through which they pursued the veins They probably were discovered from slight causes But as ore grew more scarce and avarice en∣creased the pursuit went as deep as the art or powers of the time would permit  Imus in viscera ejus Telluris et in sedes ma∣nium opes

the apertures and the stone or the ore forced out Miners often discover the marks of fire in antient mines I am in possession or a little wedge five inches and a quarter long  presented to me by Mr  Smedly  of  Bagilt Hall  discovered in working the deep fissures of  Dalar Goch  rock in the parish of  Disert  in this county This little instrument affords a proof of its antiquity by being almost entirely incrusted with lead ore It had probably lain in the course of some subterraneous stream which had brought along with it the leaden particles and de∣posited them on the iron  PICKAXES of an uncommon bulk and very clumsy have been discovered in the bottom of the mineral trenches These seem to have been the same with the  Fractaria  of the  Romans  pickaxes of enormous size used by the miners in the gold mines  Pliny  lib  xxxiii c  of  Spain  Buckets of singular construction and other things of uses unknown at present have been found among the antient mines  IN many respects the antient methods of mining were similar to those in present use The laborers worked by stems relieving each other at stated times They worked night and day by the light of lamps They drove levels and sunk shafts propping up the ground as they went on They pursued the veins by forming drifts  Ibid  and finally whenever the mines were molested with water they had pumps which flung up the water from the greatest depths they arrived at  Diodorus Siculus  lib  v c    I HAVE mentioned above  DIVINING ROD  the casual detection of our mineral wealth It will perhaps amuse the reader by informing him that in this county within my memory recourse was had to the  virgula divinatoria  or divining rod which by powers sympa∣thetic  with the latent ore was to save the usual expences of search and to point out the very spot where the treasures lay A foreign adventurer half knave half enthusiast made the trial but it proved as unfortunately unsuccessful to himself as to his ad∣mirers The instrument of the attempt was no more than a rod forked at one end  to be cut in a planetary hour on SA∣TURN'S  day  and hour because SATURN  is the significator of lead  Jupiter Venus Sol  and  Mercury  were also concerned in the time of the operation  Jupiter  or  Pars Fortunae  was to be in  Conjunction Sextile  or  Trine  to the LORD of the as∣cendent or second and the better if any reception happen but BEWARE it be not by  Square  or  Opposition  for that spoils all  Hoosons  Miner's Dictionary article  virgula divinatoria    Thus cut it is laid by for use on a heap of wheat or barley and from the rod of  Moses  was also profanely called the  Mosaical  rod This was to be held by the forks in both hands and carried over the grounds suspected to contain the ore It went unaffected over all the barren spots but no sooner did it impend over a vein than it pressed strongly down and seemed to feel the same attraction as is between iron and the magnet The sen∣sible  Agricola  speaks of this practice incidentally and gives a long account of the process but places no kind of faith in it assuring us that the skilful miner should follow the natural signs of the mineral veins and despise the use of these enchanted sticks He traces their origin from imposture The magicians of  Pharaoh  made use of wands in their deception of the serpents  Minerva  by virtue of a wand turned the aged Ulysses into a  young man and again to his former state  Circe  by the ma∣gical powers of a rod changed his companions into beasts And lastly  Mercury  by the same means impelled the watchful to sleep and the sleepy to wake  Agricola de Re Metallica  lib  ii p  Let me now return to realities  THE miners in the earlier times of the  Romans  in  Britain  seem to have been the subdued natives  Galgacus  encourages his sol∣diers to conquer or die by laying before them the dreadful consequences of a defeat  Tributa et  METALLA  et caeterae servien∣tium panae  Tributes and mines and all the dire penalties of slavery  Agricola  himself verifies the prophetic spirit of our brave chieftain by calling our mines the reward of victory These were to be worked not by the conquerors but by con∣demned criminals by slaves  Diodorus Siculus  lib v c gives a melancholy account of these slaves whose state can only be paralleled by the poor  Indians  in the mines of  Potost  and  Britons  newly subjugated It is probable that when the island was entirely settled this badge of slavery was taken away and the miners were as be∣fore the arrival of the  Romans  voluntary laborers  WHEN the ore was got it was cleansed according to the modern method and smelted in a furnace  Plinii  lib  xxxiv c  and cast into forms very nearly resembling the common pigs of lead  OF such  ROMAN PIGS OF LEAD  I have seen three found in different parts of Bri∣tain the one in  Hints  common in the manor of  Ralph Floyer  esquire in the county of Stafford in the year It was found under ground at the depth of four feet Its length  is twentytwo inches and a half the weight a hundred and fiftytwo pounds about two pounds heavier than our common pigs of lead On the upper surface is a rim within that in raised capitals struck when the metal was hot is this inscription IMPxVESP¦  VII  xTxIMPx  V  xCOS or  Imperatore  VES∣PASIANO  Septimùm  TITO  Imperatore quintùm Consule  which answers to the year or  ON one side is the word DECEA and at a distance the letter G An ingenious Anonymous in the Gentleman's  Magazine  of conjectures it to have been a C made by the superintendant of the mine or furnace to shew either that the pig had paid duty or was of due weight or of proper purity For my part I am of opinion that DECEA had once between it and the G the letter N which will render it DECEANG or  de Ceangis  the place which produced the ore but by some accident that letter was defaced and the G left seemingly un∣connected This explanation will fling light on certain pieces of lead described by  Cambden  to be taken notice of a few lines lower  THIS curious antiquity is in the cabinet of Mr  Green  apothe∣cary in  Litchfield  whose collection merits the attention of the inquisitive traveller who may be assured of the most liberal reception from the worthy owner  IN two pigs of the same kind and of the same length were discovered on  Hayshaw  moor in the manor of  Dacre  in the west riding of  Yorkshire  on the estate of Sir  John Ingleby  of  Ripley  One is preserved by the family the other was pre∣sented to the  British Museum  These also have an imperial inscrip∣tion  on the top  Imperatore  CAESARE DOMITIANO AUGUSTO  Con∣sule Septimum  This was cast in the year and under the same regulation The other pig which I saw at  Ripley Hall  has the same inscription and on one side the word  Brig  signifying that it came from the country of the  Brigantes  Vide tab IX    IN the time of  Cambden  twenty pieces of lead similar to the above were found near  Halton  in  Cheshire  some inscribed IMP DOMIT AUG C DE CEANG others IMP VESP VII T IMP V COSS These have been supposed to commemorate a victory over the  Cangi  but it is evident that they were nothing more than pigs of lead brought here for use or for transportation and I am farther satisfied that the ore which produced this lead was dug and smelted either in that part of  Flintshire  an∣tiently called  Tegangle  or the summer's residence of the  Cangi  or  Ceangi  or from the residence of the same order of people either in  Derbyshire  or some neighboring county This gives reason to suspect that these  Cangi  during their long vacant time might sometimes engage in mineral concerns and then the ore when smelted might receive the mark of the people from whom it was received The pig of lead in Mr  Green  's cabinet certain∣ly came from the  Cangi  of  Derbyshire  FROM the regulation mentioned by  Pliny  and all these impe∣rial inscriptions it is clear that the public took the mineral concerns into its own hands and had their stampmasters in proper places I cannot pretend to fix the period of the first establishment If the inscription to  Claudius  Cambden I Horsely  on a mass of lead  found in  Henry  VIII's time near  Wokey Hole  in  Somersetshire  be of the same kind with the former it must have been within the year the time of his ninth tribuneship  THE  Romans  found such plenty of silver in the  Spanish  mines that for some time they never thought it worth their labor to extract it from lead  Strabo  lib  iii p  In later times they discovered an ore that contained silver tin and lead and these three metals were smelted from it It appears that the first product was the tin the second the silver and what  Pliny  calls  Galaena  which was left behind in the furnace and seems to be the same with our  litharge  and being melted again became lead or as the antients called it to distinguish it from white lead or tin  black lead  Plinii  lib  xxxiv c    THE  British  name of lead is lost The only word we have to express an ore is  mwyn  but the species is expressed by an ad∣junct as  mwyn aur  gold  mwyn plwm  lead ore both which were probably derived from the  Latin  The  Romans  made use of the word  metallum  to express ore as well as the metal fused from it the word  minera  is a word of a barbarous age and pro∣bably derived from our  mwyn  I SHALL finish this account of the  Roman  state of the lead concerns with observing that they appeared to have been well versed in metallurgy and to have had their smeltinghouses The ruder  Britons  before their conquest by the  Romans  had a very simple process They placed the ore in a hole in the ground and mixed it with wood which being fired proved  sufficient to melt the lead out of the soft and kindly ores of this country a small gutter communicated with a second hole into which the metal ran from the first These artless slaghearths are very frequent in our county discovered by the quantity of  scoria  mixed with charcoal Some of our modern smelters have endeavoured to extract the remaining part of the metal from these slags but in vain the antient smelters having so effectually done their business as not to have left behind sufficient to pay the expences of a second operation the most that could be procured from a ton of slags amounting only to about a hundred and fifty pounds weight  I CANNOT tell what use the  Britons  made of the metal except∣ing as an article of commerce I must not dare to assent to the tale of the venerable  Bede  Lib i c p  who says that the stakes driven in∣to the  Thames  to obstruct the passage of  Caesar  were wrapped round with lead The project was useless This expedient of the  Britons  was temporary the stakes did not require such a covering to preserve them and the metal of lead was surely very improper to point them with  I am of opinion that there had been in our country a succes∣sion of founderies of lead from the time of the  Romans  to the present at every period in which the civil commotions would permit them to be carried on The  Saxons  worked the  British  mines as well as the  Romans  and made frequent use of the lead in all works of ecclesiastial magnificence The cathedral of  Lindisfarn  Bede  Hist lib iii c p  was roofed with lead by its bishop  Eadberct  about  the year that of  York  was covered with the same metal by its great prelate  Wilfrid  Eddii vit Wilfridi  in  Gale iii  in and after that  Egelric  who was elected abbot of  Crowland  in roofed the infirmary and chapel of that famous abby in a similar manner  Ingulphi  Hist apud  Cambden  Script post  Bedem    I men∣tion these circumstances merely to shew that the  Saxons  continued the business of smelting in the different parts of our island We are assured that there have been at different times smeltingworks for a century or two past in the parishes of  Flint  and  Hawarden  and at present there is one in use in each of them  I shall take this opportunity of mentioning incidentally the other minerals of  Greet Britain  taken notice of by the antients either as articles of trade or matters of curiosity  TIN was aot only the first metal in these islands which we read of  TIN  but also the greatest object of commerce and which originally led to the discovery of  Great Britain  by the  Romans  The mercantile  Phoenicians  traded to the  Silley  islands the  Cassi∣terides  or land of tin from the port of  Cadiz  four hundred years before CHRIST The  Romans  for a considerable space could not discover the place from whence the former procured the precious metal They attempted to detect the trade by following the course of a  Phoenician  vessel but the master faithful to the in∣terest of his country voluntarily run his ship ashore in another place preferring the loss of all rather than suffer a foreign na∣tion to become partakers of so profitable a secret The public immediately compensated his loss out of its treasury This did  but make the  Romans  more eager after the discovery and after many trials succeeded  Publius Crassus  father of  Marcus Crassus  the  Triumvir  who was praetor and governed  Spain  for several years landed in the  Cassiterides  and found the report of their riches verified  Strabo  lib iii p to    As soon as the  Romans  made a conquest of the country they formed in the tin province camps and roads still visible and left behind vases urns sepulchres and money that exhibit daily proofs of their having been a stationary people in those parts  Borlase Antiq Cornwall p  and that  Dunmonium  extended even to the  Belerian  promontory or the Land'send and was not as some writers imagine limited by the western parts of  Somersetshire  IT is not to be imagined that they could neglect a corner of our island productive of a metal so useful in mechanics as tin and which it yielded in such plenty as to receive from that circumstance the name So great was the intercourse that fo∣reign nations had with the inhabitants bordering on  Belerium  as to give them a greater  sçavoir vivre  and more extensive hos∣pitality than was to be found in other parts of the island They were equally expert in working the mines and preparing the ore which lay in earthy veins within the rocky strata They melted and purified it then cast it into rows of cubes and car∣ried it to  Ictis  the modern Isle of  Wight  from thence it was transported into  Gaul  conveyed from the place it was landed at on horses backs a journey of thirty days to the mouth  of the  Rhone  and then to the  Massylians  and the town of  Nar∣bon  Diodorus Siculas Ed Wechel  pp      WITH tin the  Romans  made mirrors lined their vessels of brass to prevent its deadly effects  Plinii  lib xxxiv c  made pewter and from that a variety of domestic vessels and by the combination of other metals formed a substance that mimicked silver  Ibid  so that a country abundant in so useful an

their rich mines of copper and have been obliged at first to have imported that metal Perhaps the ore was less ac∣cessible and the art of fusion unknown for islands from their very situation must remain longer ignorant of arts than conti∣nents especially ours which lay far to the west of the origin of all science  STRABO says that they imported works of brass but it is as certain that they afterwards did themselves fabricate that metal into instruments The  Celts  a  British  instrument was made in this island Numbers have been found in  Yorkshire  and in  Essex  Borlase Antiq

that is found combined with them or whether they learned it from their con∣querors  who were fully possessed of the art of fusing this as well as other metals is unknown The  Romans  had their foun∣deries of copper in our island and cast the metal into regular forms A mass was found at  Caer hėn  the antient  Conarium  four miles above  Conway  which probably was smelted from the ore of the  Snowdon  hills where of late years much has been got This mass is in shape of a cake of beeswax and on the up∣per part is a deep concave impression with the words SOCIO ROMAE across these is

re∣mains of the brassfounderies discovered in our kingdom shew that they were acquainted with it The knowlege of this mine∣ral in afterages was long lost Before the reign of  Elizabeth  much was imported from  Sweden  but at that period it was dis∣covered again in the  Mendip  hills and fortunately at the same time that the working of the copper mines in those of  Cumberland  was renewed Our county abounds with it but till within these sixty years we were so ignorant of its value as to mend our roads with it  CAESAR and  Strabo  Caesar Com Strabo lib iv  p    allow that we had iron  IRON  The first says that it was rare far bits of it passed for money by weight In  Strabo  's days it was found in greater plenty for he mentions it among the articles of exportation Immense beds of ironcinders are to this day found in the forest of  Dean  the reliques of the  Romans  others in  Monmouthshire  another was discovered near  Miskin  the seat of  William Basset  Esq  beneath which

coins all which evince the frequency of ironfounderies during the period of the  Roman  reign in  Britain  These cinders are not half ex∣hausted of their metal for the  Romans  knew only the weak powers of the footblast They are now worked over again and are found to yield a more kindly metal than what is produced from the ore These beds are supposed to be almost inex∣haustible a proof of the vast founderies of early times  GOLD and silver are enumerated  Strabo  lib iv p  among the products of  Great Britain  GOLD  The  Romans  were acquainted with this and our pre∣cious metals proved another incentive to their ambition to effect our conquest  Agricola  in his oration to his soldiers before the battle of the  Grampian  mountain excites them to victory by  reminding them of our riches the reward or valor  Fert  BRITANNIA  aurum et argentum et alia metalla pretium vic∣toriae  Vita Agr    THESE metals have in later times been got in quantities sufficient to prove that they might in earlier time be an ob∣ject worthy of conquest In the reigns of  James  IV and V vast wealth was procured in the  Lead Hills  from the gold col∣lected from the sand washed from the mountain In the reign of the latter not less than three hundred thousand pounds  Ster∣ling  In another place a piece of thirty ounces weight was found Much was also obtained in the time of the Re∣gent  Morton

to this day found in  Cornwall  mixed with tin and other substances  Borlase  Nat Hist  Cornwall    The largest piece that has been yet disco∣vered is equal in weight to three guineas It is probable that it was the  Cornish  gold which proved the lure to the  Romans  for it was impossible they or the  Phoenicians  could be ignorant of it who had such long commerce with the country and who were acquainted with the manner of obtaining it in other places  Pliny  speaking of tin says that there is found in the gold mines of  Spain  and  Portugal  a sort called  Elutia  which a  Cornish  man

I must inform them that it proved only a bed of  mica curea  or to speak like a punster turned out nothing but  tal      STRABO and  Tacitus  agree  SILVER  that we had mines of silver In the reigns of  Edward  I and III there were very considerable works at  Combmartin  in  Devonshire  Camb  en i  three hundred and thirtyseven miners sent for out of  Derbyshire  were employed in them and the produce was so great as to assist  Edward  the third to carry on the war with  France  In the beginning of this cen∣tury much native silver was found on the estate of Sir  John Erskine  in the county of  Stirling  but the vein was soon ex∣hausted  THE BRITONS were acquainted with the uses of gold and the art of coining before the arrival of the  Romans  witness the golden sickles of the  Druids  the coins found at  Carnbre  in  Corn∣wall  and the coins of  Cassivelaunus  They made use of diffe∣rent sorts of metals but mostly of gold being the easiest fused and most capable of an impression Doctor  Borlase  has preserved a series of these very early coins from the rudest and most un∣intelligible impressions to the period when the  Britons  made an attempt to form a face on their coins All these are unlettered a proof of their antiquity and of their having been struck before their intercourse with the  Romans  The first we know of which is inscribed is that of  Cassrvelaunus  cotemporary with  Caesar  The next is of  Cunobeline  who had even been at  Rome  As soon as the  Britons  became acquainted with the  Ro∣mans  they made an essay to imitate their manner of coining they put letters on them elephants and gryphons things they were before unacquainted with They were not suffered to make any progress in the art for as soon as their conquest was effected their coin was suppressed The learned have en∣deavoured to trace these antient monies from the  Phoenicians  but the comparison would not hold The  Gauls  alone had some pieces similar nor is this to be wondered at since they and the  Britons  had a common origin were neighbors and might as well agree in the few arts they had as in religion and lan∣guage  Borlase  's  Antiq Cornwall  tab xix tab lxxxv    I NOW return to the subjects which occassioned this digres∣sion and to give some account of the various antique instruments and coins found near  Flint  and accompany the same by the more expressive description a print  N  o  tab viii is a rich ornament of gold in form of a but∣ton with a shank It is composed elegantly with twisted wire and studded with little globular bits of solid gold This seems to have belonged to the bracelet or necklace it is uncertain which whose fragment is represented at N  o  This is also composed of gold links with round beads of a rich blue glass placed between every second link Something similar to this is preserved by count  Caylus  which is entire and appears to have been a necklace  Tom iii    N  o  is a cylindric fragment of glass probably part of some ornament being of a rich blue color and perforated as if it was designed to be strung With it was found a thick piece of seagreen glass part of a vase Glass was among the earlier imports into  Britain  Strabo  when the wild natives were as much cap∣tivated with toys as the  Indians  of newdiscovered countries are at present At first they received these and all their other vitreous commodities by means of the  Phaenicians  whose ca∣pital  Tyre  was preeminent in that manufacture The  glain nadroedd  or snakegems were at first obtained by way of exchange for the  British  exports They were originally made by the  Britons  of stone I have such a one in my cabinet I have seen another in possession of the Reverend Mr  Hugh Davies  found in  Anglesea  The traders soon learned to imitate what was prized so high in our island in a more elegant material and imported them as a most captivating article of commerce in the same manner as circum navigators often mimic in shewy brass the utensils and weapons of  Indian  nations in order to engage their friendship  N  o  is a small brazen head with the back part affixed to iron Perhaps this was one of the  Sigillaria  or little images sold at the fairs and presented usually to children  Non cognoscis me ego sum  Policio  cui solebas sigillaria afferre SENICA Epist  and the fairs where these toys were sold went by the same name A learned friend also supposes these to be miniature likenesses which friends presented to each other as memorials  N  o  is a  Stylus  or instrument for writing on the  ceratae ta∣bellae  or waxen tablets which were made of thin leaves of lead brass or ivory and covered with a thin coat of wax The pen if I may call it so was usually of brass one end pointed in order to write the other flatted in order to efface what was wrong by smoothing or closing the wax  Horace  gives every writer most excellent advice in alluding to this prac∣tice  Saepe  Stylum  vertas iterum quae digna legi sint  Scripturns  Oft turn your style when you intend to write  Things worthy to be read  N  o  is an instrument of very singular use a narrow species of spoon destined to collect at funerals the tears of the relations of the deceased in order to deposit them in the little phials which were placed with the ashes in the urn memo∣rials of their grief Such are very frequently found but the custom is far higher than that of classical antiquity for the PSALMIST in expressing his sorrows alludes to it THOU  tellest my flittings put my tears into thy bottle  N  o  is an instrument seemingly designed for the purpose of dressing the wicks of lamps  N  o  may possibly be destined for the same uses  N  o  is a brazen bodkin  N  o  is a  fibula  or brotche gilt and enameled with deep blue in front  N  o  is a brotche not unlike some used at present by the common Highlanders whose dress in its genuine simplicity seems to have been borrowed from the  Romans  N  o  is also a species of button but differs from the modern as do all I have seen by having no shank instead was a tongue similar to those of the common  fibulae  The front of this is enameled with deep blue  N  o  is another of a very different form This has also lost its  fibulae  but the defect is very apparent  N  o  is a  forceps  an instrument much in vogue among the  Romans  for extirpating hairs This was used for the same pur∣pose as the  Turkish  fair do the  Rusma  The pincers here en∣graven are of great size and strength perhaps used by some robust coxcomb such as  Persius  rallies so severely in his fourth satire for his unbecoming effeminacy  N  o  seem to have been instruments of sacrifice One end of each is round and of the form of an olive and was intended for the use of the  aruspices  to insinuate under the en∣trails of the victim and to lift them up for the better inspec∣tion of the parts The other extremity of the longer is formed into a spoon for the purpose of putting the frankincense into the censer  ACCORDING to the uncertainty that reigns respecting the uses of the antient instruments I may hazard another conjecture that they have been chirurgical instruments The rounded ends were the probes the hollow end of the longer the spoon by which the balm was poured into the wound The metal of which these instruments were made proves as count  Caylus  re∣marks  Recueil d'Antiquitez iv    that the  Romans  had no apprehensions of its dangerous qualities It is probable that they had the art of tempering the metal so as to prevent the noxious effects  N  o  is a brass nail  Antiquaries may rejoice that the  Romans  preferred this metal to mouldering iron which has pre∣served to them many a delicious morsel  N  o  tab ix is one of those  Bullae  or amulets called  Ithyphallus  in

afterwards from all kinds of evil  Pueris turpicula res in collo quaedam suspenditur ne quid obsit bonae scaevae causa VARRO de Ling Lat vi  I cannot help thinking that the good nurses had another view that of attracting in years of maturity the affections of the fair towards their little favorite  Hunc optent generum Rex et Regina puell  e  Hunc rapiant Quicquid calcaverit hic Rosa fiat  Wherever he treads let there rise up a rose  And the ladies die for him wherever he goes  For it is well known the obscene god in all times had his votaries among both sexes  THESE amulets also represented the god  Fascinus  synonymous with that Deity  Pliny  Lib xxviii c  relates that he was not only the guar∣dian of infants but of the emperors themselves that the very vestals worshipped him and the victors placed him the physician of Envy beneath their triumphal cars  N  o  is a locket with a hole at one end in order to sus∣pend it round the neck or fasten it to the wrist This per∣haps was designed to hold a charm and the holes on one side intended that the contents should transpire and reach the object of fascination whether of love whether of am∣bition  N  o  a key which gives one no very high idea of the ele∣gance of the  Roman  locksmiths  N  o  is one of a nicer form and which served both for a ring and key It possibly was designed for the cabinet of a  Roman  lady or some  Bellus homo  N  o  two rings one of brass the other of silver wire  N  o  a brazen weight belonging to a mason's levellingin∣strument answerable to a modern plummet  N  o  another of lead belonging to a fishingnet  N  o  the tongue of an ordinary  fibula  THESE are the subjects I thought most worthy of engraving but there were multitudes of other things found in the same place but almost all of them so mutilated or injured by time as to be rendered quite unintelligible  ON leaving  Flint  FINE PROSPECT  I took the road to  Halkin  and immediately on quitting the town began to ascend the steep slope of the county fertile and inclosed to the very edge of the mountain which was parallel with the shore The prospect improves the whole way and from the heights expands to the northeast and south into an almost boundless one The estuary of the  Dee  appears beneath with the city of  Chester  at its extremity The peninsula of  Wiral  a naked contrast to our country limits the eastern side of our sea and the western of the  Mersey  rich in the commerce of  Leverpool  beyond which stretches the great county of  Lancashire  varying with plains and hills The moun∣tains of  Yorkshire  and  Derbyshire  unite to bound the VALE ROYAL of  England  and the rich and wooded tract about  Northop  and  Hawarden  with its neighboring mountains bring relief to the eye tired with the contemplation of the far remote views  THIS is but part of the magnificent terras formed by the pub∣lic road that is continued from  Hawarden  to  Clynnog  in  Caernar∣vonshire  varying continually with matchless changes of scenery  THE first place of any note which occurs in the parish of  Halkin  HALKIN  is a hamlet of a number of houses called the  Pentre  or hamlet a name in  Wales  common to all such assemblages of dwellings where there is no church to distinguish it from  Llan  where the place of devotion stands This took its rise in the present century and was much increased by the concourse of miners on the discovery of a rich vein in the adjacent fields  ALMOST contiguous lies  Halkin  mountain a vast tract in the parish of the same name and in those of  Northop Skeiviog  and  Holywell  THE surface is common the mineral the property of Lord  Grosvenour  by virtue of a grant made in to his ancestor Sir  Richard Grosvenour  knight by  Charles  I of all the mines of lead or rakes of lead within the hundreds of  Coleshill  and  Rud∣land  Harleian  MSS N  o    These tracts were before set on leases for a certain term of years Thus  James  I grants that term to  Richard Gwynne  on payment of the annual acknowlegement of sixtysix shillings and eight pence and a new one was granted in by a warrant from lord treasurer  Weston  to  Richard Grosvenour  Esq  Roger Grosvenour  his son and Mr  Thomas Gamul  for their joint lives paying the usual rent and a fine of ten pounds  Ibid    I APPREHEND that this grant and another similar of the mi∣nerals in  Bromefield  and  Yale  made to the same gentleman are the first alienations of this nature from the crown which for many centuries after the Conquest assumed the entire claim of all mines and minerals by virtue of the royal prerogative Sir  John Pettus  Fodinae Regales  from p to  has preserved a series of grants from the reign of  Edward  I to that of  Henry  VII in which they empower different persons to scarch for ore Some of them are confined to particular counties others to the kingdom in general and the only prohibition is that of working beneath castles or houses in gardens or meadows the owners of which were to be indemnified in all damages they might sustain  Richard  II is the first prince who makes a general allowance In his letters patent to  Richard Wake  clerk for searching for mines  of gold and silver in the county of  Devon  for ten years the adventurer had power to dig paying damage to the owner of the ground as well within liberties as without and to pay onetenth of the profit to the Holy Church and a ninth into the exchequer  THIS is not the first instance of the application of the tithe of ore to religious uses  Edward  I directs the same proportion to be payed to the parochial churches in  Wales  out of the neighboring mines  Rotull Wallia  Sir  Joseph Ayloff's  The abby of  Basingwork  had also a reve∣nue arising from the same source  Tanner's  Notit  Monast    I CANNOT find that the owner of the ground in case the mine was discovered in private property was permitted to have any share of the profit till the fifth of  Henry  VI when the duke of  Bedford  regent of  France  received a ten years leafe of all the mines of gold and silver in the kingdom of  England  paying to Holy Church a tenth to the king a fifteenth and to the lord of the soil the twentieth part This allotment though finall is a proof of the justice and moderation that guided the actions of the protector of  Henry  's infant years  THESE regal grants were for every species of metal except∣ing iron for gold and silver copper tin and lead and all other metals containing gold and silver These two were the great object yet the grants do not preclude the royal clame to the baser kinds  DURING this reign the art of refining or the separation of metals from the ore was made the ground of an imposture  common enough in after times There are not fewer than four instances of persons undertaking the transmutation of the baser metals into pure gold and silver each of whom received the royal protection  Rymer's Foedera  xi  Henry  IV had passed an act that  none shall use to multiply gold or silver nor use the craft of multiplication and if any the same do that he incur penalty of felony  This was aimed at persons who under pretence of transmutation counterfeited the nobler metals But afterwards it was found a check on the metallurgic art as it extended even to the punishment of any ingenious refiner who had discovered the method of getting more gold and silver out of the baser kinds than was known before which occasioned the repeal of the act in the first year of  William  and  Mary  c  to prevent them from being interrupted in their operations for certain malevolent people supposed they used unlawful arts  i e  the art magic In a supersticious age this suspicion might have proved fatal to the projectors who wisely assumed the most religious term for their mystery to ob∣viate the malice of their enemies The metals were not to be transmuted but  transubstantiated  Ibid  for they had great reason to imagine that the believers of the word in the religious sense would hardly contradict the feasibility of the project in the temporal meaning Besides they were to act under the guise of piety for the adept  must be  bomo frugi  A pious holy and religious man  One free from mortal sin a very virgin  Ben Jonson's  Alchemist    We hear nothing of the event of these undertakings but ima∣gine they ended like all others of that nature The bubble did  not die with this weak prince for in we find that  Ed∣ward  IV gave the same encouragement to one  David Beaupe  and  John Marchaunt  to have for four years  facultatem et scientiam philosophiae artificialem naturalem generationis a mercurio in aurum faciendo et simili modo a mercurio in argentum  the liberty of changing  mercury  into gold and silver  Rymer xii  We hear no more of these impostures till the reigns of  Elizabeth  and  James  I when they were most successfully revived  Vide Life of Doctor  Dee Ben Jonson's  Alchemist  c    EDWARD continued the mineral grants to several great men among others to the earl of  Warwick  the earl of  Northumber∣land  and his brother  Richard  earl of  Gloster  The farm was now encreased they were to pay the king an eighth neat profit the lord of the soil the ninth and the curate of the place the tenth  IN the short and turbulent reign of  Richard  III no attention was paid to concerns of this kind but his successor  Henry  VII in his very first year discovered his ruling passion avarice by immediately appointing  Jasper  duke of  Bedford  and several other persons of distinction to be governors of all his mines in  England  and in  Wales  paying to the king the fifteenth  Moses Stringer  author of  Opera Mineralia explicata  calls it the  fifth  which suits better the character of that monarch  of the  pure  gold and silver and to the lord of the soil the eleventh  as it grows  ELIZABETH was the first of our princes who laid the founda∣tion for our mineral success and for all the vast manufactures  that arose in consequence I read that in  Henry  VI  Rymer xi  possibly on discovery of the imposture of metallic transmuta∣tions had sent for out of  Hungary Austria  and  Bohemia  three experienced miners and thirty assistants to work his mines so unskilled were the  English  at that time The civil wars which broke out immediately after frustrated this wise measure  Elizabeth  resumed it being too quicksighted not to see into the defects and wants of her kingdom She not only adopted it but improved on the plan Our knowlege of minerals was almost extinguished and of course the manufactures which depended on them We imported our swords our knives stir∣rups bits and even our pins out of  Germany  through the channel of the  Netherlands  Our works of brass and even our wire excepting a small quantity which was worked by hand were of foreign fabrick The first step taken by this politic princess was to forbid the importation of these and several other articles from parts beyond sea  Statute th  Elizabeth  c  the next was to invite into her kingdom foreign miners foreign smelters and foreign arti∣ficers of metallic productions  SHE next formed a corporation under the title of THE SOCIETY FOR THE MINES ROYAL The first governor was  William  earl of  Pembroke  several men of rank were joined in the commis∣sion as assistants and several citizens and some foreigners of known experience in these matters She likewise framed the same members into another corporation which naturally depended on the former  viz  the SOCIETY FOR THE MINERALS AND BATTERY WORKS These corporations were founded on  May  the th  SOME progress had been made a few years before for the procuring materials for these new manufactures for in she had granted the mines of eight counties besides those in  Wales  to  Daniel Houghsetter  in she made another grant to  Cornelius Devosse  and a third in the same year more com∣prehensive than all to  Christopher Shutz  of all mines minerals and subterraneous treasures except copperas and allum which shall be found in all other parts of  England  not mentioned in the former patent or within the  English  pale in  Ireland  by the name of gold silver copper tin lead quicksilver  cadmian  ore or  lapis calaminaris  and all manner of ewres or oares simple or pure mixt or compounded for latten wire or steel  c  To each of these patentees an  Englishman  was joined  IT is worth observing that the crown in most of these grants lays absolute clame to all mines whatsoever under a notion that they are royal mines yet the prerogative could only be entitled to such which yielded gold and silver The ori∣gin of this pretence arose from the king's right of coinage in order that he might have the requisite materials which would have confined him to the two noble metals But until the happy period arrived when our constitution was established and the royal and the private property justly distinguished the subject was too weak to assert his rightful clame ELIZABETH herself was too fond of the darling prerogative even with all her boasted love to her people to resign this part Her pa∣tent to  William Humfrey  and  Christopher Shutz  is worded in the most unlimited manner for it not only gave them power to sink shafts wheresoever they pleased gardens  c  excepted  but to build houses requisite to carry on the works not only upon the royal demesnes but in the grounds of any of her subjects The spirited  Percies  in the person of  Thomas  earl of  Northumberland  first withstood this invasion of his right He contested with the crown the title to the copper mines in his manor of  Keswick  but the lawyers decided against him al∣leging that although the crown had a power to grant away its manors it had not the power to alienate the mineral being per∣fectly linked to the prerogative of the crown  BUT as usual the gentlemen of the long robe had two opinions respecting this point some asserting that if any gold or silver was found in the mines of baser metal the whole would belong to the king which in fact was bestowing all the mineral property on the crown there being scarcely any base metal but what holds some particles of the nobler others again in a future reign qualified this by saying  That although the gold or silver contained in the base metal of a mine in the hands of a subject be of less value than the base metal yet if the gold or silver do countervail the charge of resining it or be of more worth than the base metal spent in resining it THIS IS A ROYAL MINE and as well the base metal as the gold and silver in it belong to the prerogative of the crown  This opinion was given in and subscribed by  Maynard Glaw ville  and others the first  vers of the time    SUCH was the state of the royal clame so discouraging to the industry of the subject till the great event of the REVO∣LUTION  when the crown in the first year of  William  and  Mary  fully gave up all pretensions to the mines of copper tin iron and lead notwithstanding gold or silver may be extracted from them in any quantities By a following act this right was again confirm∣ed only the crown reserved to itself a power of purchasing within thirty days after raising all ores made merchantable at the fol∣lowing rates copper at  l per  ton tin at  l  lead at l and in default of such payment the owners were at liberty to dispose of their ore as they pleased Thus as Mr BLACKSTON  COMMENTARIES to i  ob∣serves the private owners were not discouraged from working mines through a fear that they may be clamed as royal neither does the king depart from the just rights of his revenue since he may have all the precious metal contained in the ore paying no more for it than the value of the base metal is supposed to be to which base metal the landowner is by reason and law entitled  SOME account of the ores and fossils of the mineral tract which gave rise to this digression will be given when I cross it again in the course of my journey  FROM  Pentre Halkin  I pursued my journey along the  Chester  road and pass by the  Llan  The church is dedicated to St  Mary  is a neat small edifice lately rebuilt partly by a brief partly by subscription It stood on the site of a church men∣tioned in Doomsday book At the Conquest this tract bore the name of  Alchene  from which the present name is taken  Brunford  a township now in the parish of  Holywell  and a place  called  Inglecroft  at that time were joined to it Doomsday book says that here was a church and a presbyter and three boors a mill of five shillings annual value and a wood half a league long and forty perches broad the whole valued at ten shil∣lings  THE old  British  name of this place still retained by the  Welsh  is  Lugan  from a saint known I believe only in the  Welsh  calendar  ABOUT two or three miles farther in a woody morass on the left hand are the foundations of an antient pile called  Llýs Edwin  or Llýs Llan  Eurgain  originally the seat of  Edwin ap Gronw  lord of  Tegangle  about the year It continued in the family till the death of a descendant of his  Howel Gwynedd  who lost his life in the cause of  Glendwr  when his forfeited estates were bestowed by  Henry  IV on one  Bryan Saxton  His posterity possessed them till the th of  Henry  VI who granted them to Sir  John Stanley  groom of the bedchamber  History of the house of  Starley    They afterwards became the property of a younger branch of the  Stanleys  and remained in their possession in the last century I find a Sir  Edward Stanley  of  Flint  Collins  's Peerage

soars above the road  MOEL Y GAER  about two miles to the right It lies on the summit of a hill and is surrounded with a great foss and dike  of a circular form with an entrance as usual to such places and a small artificial mount within the precinct a  tribunal cespi∣titium  from whence our antient heroes might deliver their  araith  or  allocutio  to animate their followers against the invading strangers This post is called  Moel y Gaer  or the hill of the fortress a name common to several others of similar use This seems to have been an out post of the  Ordovices  in order to defend their country against the  Roman  invaders We shall towards the end of the volume have occasion to mention the chain of posts along the  Clwydian  hills from that next to the sea to remote and internal parts Our an∣cestry disputed the possession of their country by inches Here they lodged their wives and children to these places they drove their cattle out of the low country they established in each numerous garrisons ready to sally forth and repel the foe or to defend all that was dear to them should the in∣vaders be hardy enough to attack them in their intrench∣ments  IN later times this spot proved fatal to a valiant partizan of  Owen Glendwr Howel Gwynedd  whom we lately mentioned was surprized in a negligent hour within this post and there be∣headed  NORTHOP

near this place called to this day  Coed Eulo  part of the flower of the army detached by  Henry  II in from his camp on  Saltney  was surprized and defeated by  David  and  Conan  BATTLE  the sons of  Owen Gwynedd  sent by their father with a strong party from his ramp near  Basingwerk  They suffered the enemy to march along the streights of the country till their forces were entangled in the depth of woods and the steeps of the narrow vallies so frequent in these parts The attack was sudden fierce and unexpected the Daughter dreadful and the pursuit carried even to  Henry  's encampment  Powel  This proved but a prelude to the  English  of a second defeat The king with an intent to repair the disgrace marched forward with his whole army and at  Coleshill  near  Flint  BATTLE OF COLE∣SHILL  suffered himself to be en∣gaged in the same difficulties as his detachment experienced be∣fore His forces were again defeated and  Eustace Fitz John  a baron first in rank wealth and abilities among the  English  and  Robert de Courci  another great baron with numbers of others were slain  Henry de Essex  hereditary standardbearer and a man of approved valor was seized with a panic and flinging down the standard cried out that the king was killed  Guil Neubrig  lib ii c This is the author whom the  Welsh  call  Gwillim Bach Brompton    The route would have been general if the king had not valiantly rallied his forces and repulsed the  Welsh  but in the end he thought it prudent to withdraw his army and encamp in a secure station It probably was on the elevated ground of the township of  Cole∣sh  ll  at  Gadlys  a name significant of the circumstance  palatium∣castrense  or the royal headquarters He afterwards attempted to cut off the retreat of  Owen Gwynedd  by marching along the shore and getting between him and the mountains but the wise prince penetrating into his views retired to a plain near St  Asaph  still called CILOWEN or  Owen's retreat  and from thence to a strong post named  Bryn y Pin  defended by great Tamparts and ditches This camp lies in the parish of St  George  on a lofty rock above the church and is now called  Pen y Parc  BRYN DYCHWELWCH  Bryn  a hill  Dychwilweh  return  or the eminence on which  Owen  pro∣nounced the order RETREAT by its name preserves the me∣mory of the circumstance It lies over  Pentre Bagilt  below  Gadlys  and is supposed to have been the spot from which he re∣tired to  CilOwen  A CIRCUMSTANCE consequential of this battle proves that the report of  Edgar  's having extirpated the race of wolves out of the principality was erroneous A young  Welshman  killed in this battle was discovered eight days after attended by his faithful dog who remained by the corpse the whole time with∣out food and defended it from being the prey of birds and wolves  Girald Cambr Itin  lib ii c p    THERE is no sort of tradition about the founder of the castle of  Eulo  Whether it might not have been built by one of the lords of  Tegangle  or whether it was erected by  Henry  to prevent a similar disaster by placing a garrison here I  will pretend not to determine It has been for centuries in ruins for  Leland  speaks of it as  a ruinus castle or pile belonging to  Hoele  a gentleman of  Flyntshire  that by auncient accustume was wont to give the bagge of the sylver harpe to the beste harpir of  North Walys  as by a privelege of his ancestors  Leland Itin  V    The antiquary adds 'that he dwellith at  Penrine  in  Flyntshire'  We know of no such place in the county but suspect that the gentleman intended was  Thomas ap Richard ap Howel  lord of  Mostyn  in whose family that privilege was long invested that gentleman having been cotemporary with  Leland  THE manor of  Eulo  was in the crown in the th of  Henry  VIII who granted it to  Peter Stanley  esquire  MANOR  gentleman of his hous∣hold with the tolls of the market of  Flint  Harleian  MSS N  o    In the reign of queen  Elizabeth  it was held by  Edward Stanley  by payment of  l    s  a year  The same N  o    At present it is in possession of  John Davies  esquire of  Llanerch  WITHIN this lordship are very considerable potteries of coarse earthenware  POTTERIES  such as pans jugs great pots for butter plates dishes ovens flowerpots  c  There are fourteen works which make annually between three and four thousand pounds worth The ware is mostly exported to  Ireland  and the towns on the  Welsh  coast particularly to  Swansey  There are besides six other works for the making of firebricks few clays being better fitted for the purpose of resisting the intense heat of the smelt∣ingfurnaces These are made of different sizes and some of  those which are called bearers weigh two hundred pounds Great quantities of tiles for barnfloors and for rooms are also made here and the annual sale of these two articles amounts to about twelve hundred pounds  THIS clay is of a deep ash color is found in beds of a great thickness and is dug up in hard lumps resembling a shaley rock after which it is left for a considerable time exposed to the air in order to effect its dissolution The bricks made with it are set in the leadfurnaces with the unburnt clay instead of mortar  I must not leave the parish of  Northop  without visiting the maritime parts which stretch along the channel of the  Dee  We find there the names of certain townships taken notice of in Doomsday book  Leadbrook Normanized  into  Lathroc  from the  AngloSaxon Laed  and  Broca  either from the quantity of lead washed out of it or from the smeltingworks established on it This township after the Conquest was held by  Robert  of  Rudland  ULFMILTONE was another now known by the name of  Golf∣tyn  WEPRE another township was held by  William de Malbedeng  from the church of  Chester  It is twice mentioned in Doomsday book and is said to have had on it a wood a league and a half long In one place mention is made of two villeyns and two boors in another of one villeyn and a  radman  and that it had been possessed by one  Ernui  a freeman Of late years a very handsome pier has been built by the river  Dee  company in this township jutting into the channel for the protection of  the ships bound to or from  Chester  under which they may take shelter in bad weather or adverse winds  FROM hence I ascended to  Hawarden  HAWARDEN  a small town flourishing under the auspices of its lord Sir  John Glynne  baronet I shall speak first of the manor and castle The last forms a most picturesque object soaring above the woods This place like most others in our county bears two names  Pennard halawg  perhaps corrupted from  Pen y Llŵch  or  the head land above the lake Saltney  and the other subjacent marshes having once been covered by the sea The other name is  Saxon  as we find it written in Doomsday book  Haordine  at which time it was a lordship had a church two  Carucae  or ploughlands half of one belonging to the latter half an acre of meadow a wood two leagues long and half a league broad The whole was valued at forty shillings yet on all this were but four vil∣leyns six boors and four slaves so low was the state of popu∣lation  IT is probable  ROMAN  that this place had been a  British  post opposed to the country of the  Cornavii  and to the invading  Romans  To the west of the church in a field adjoining to the road is a mount called  Truman  's hill within a piece of ground which appears to have been squared and nicely sloped This evi∣dently had been a small camp whose figure has been much obliterated by the frequency of agriculture It stood on the brow of the hill and commanded a full view of the country Another mount called  Conna's Hê  is to be seen near Broad∣lane house The Rost an eminence overlooking another flat with fosses and an exploratory mount lying in the parish of  Gresford  was another and at  CaerEstyn  a fourth We shall find occasion to speak more of these in the course of our journey  THE  Saxons  possessed themselves of every strong hold which the  Britons  or the  Romans  had deserted  SAXON  Some they retained others they neglected as the policy of the new invaders and the necessity of the situation required This before the Conquest was a chief manor and the capital one of the hundred of  Atiscross  On the invasion of  William  it was found in the possession of the gal∣lant  Edwin  and probably was one of the places of his residence It was a cover to his  Mercian  dominions against the  Britons  the natural and inveterate enemies of the  Saxon  race  ON the Conquest  NORMAN  it was comprehended in the vast grant made to  Hugh Lupus  It afterwards devolved to the barons of  Montalto  or  Mold  which they held by stewartship to the earls of  Chester  and made it their residence  Cambden ii    GENEALOGISTS  Collin  's Peerage i  tell us that  Roger Fitzvalerine  son of one of the noble adventurers who followed the fortunes of  William  the conqueror possessed this castle and having frequent con∣tests with the  Welsh  often saved himself by retreating to it and from that circumstance it was called  Howard's Den  But with high respect to all the blood of all the  Howards  it does not appear that their name was then known with more probabi∣lity does their historian say that  William  the son of  Fitzvalerine  received the addition of  de Haward  or  Howard  from the accident of being born in this place  ON the extinction of the antient earls of  Chester  to prevent that honor from being according to the expression of the time  parcelled out among distaffs  this as well as the other fortresses were resumed by the crown  CEDED TO LLEWE∣LYN AP GRYF∣FYDD  In  Llewelyn  prince of  Wales  had a conference at this place  Annales Cestrenses  quoted by  Carte ii  with  Simon de Montfort  the potent earl of Leicester where they established peace between  Cheshire  and  Wales  in order to promote their respective designs and in the year following on  June  the d  Montfort  obliged his captive monarch to make an absolute cession to the  Welsh  prince not only of this fortress  Rymer i  but of the absolute sove∣reignty of  Wales  and the homage of its barons heretofore paid to  Henry  After the suppression of  Leicester  's rebellion  Hawar∣din  relapsed to the crown  RELAPSES TO THE CROWN  I must observe that in in the pacification brought about by the Pope's legate  Ottoboni  between  Henry  and  Llewelyn  it seems as if the castle had been destroy∣ed for among other articles  Llewelyn  agrees to restore to  Ro∣bert de Montalto  his lands in  Hawarden  and restrains him from building a castle there for thirty years  Idem i  probably it was de∣stroyed by  Llewelyn  himself who foresaw the impossibility of his keeping a fortress fo near the  English  borders The castle must soon have been rebuilt for I find in it was styled  Castrum Regis  THAT year was distinguished by the general insurrection of the  Welsh  under their prince  Llewelyn  and his brother  David  the great effort of our gallant countrymen to preserve their liberties and antient mode of government The attempt was  begun by  David  at that time newly reconciled to his brother on  March  d on  PalmSunday  in a stormy night which fa∣vored his design  S  E  IZED BY DAVID AP GRYFFYDD  He surprized this castle put the garrison to the sword and wounded and took prisoner  Roger de Clifford  justi∣ciary of  Chester  After the death of  Llewelyn  and the sub∣jection of  Wales David  suffered for this in a most severe and distinguished manner being the first in  England  who died as a traitor in the way in use at this time He was a prince of a most unamiable character equally perfidious to his brother his country and to  Edward  his benefactor and protector In the writ for his trial which was before the whole baronage of  Eng∣land Edward  enumerates his kindnesses to him in this pathetic manner  Quem susceperamus exulem nutriveramus orphanum ditaveramus de propriis terris nostris et sub alarum nostrarum chlamide foveravimus ipsum inter majores nostri palatii collo∣cavimus  Rymer ii    The last proved his greatest misfortune He might have pleaded exemption from the  English  jurisdiction and flung a strong odium on the tyranny of the conqueror had he not accepted a barony a seat among the  English  peers He was in the same situation as the duke of  Hamilton  in later times who denying the power of the court was told that he was not tried as a  Scotch  peer but as earl of  Cambridge  a peerage bestowed on him by his unfortunate master  DAVID was condemned to four species of punishment to be drawn by a horse to the place of execution as a traitor to the king who had made him a knight to be hanged for murder∣ing  Fulk Trigald  and other knights in this castle for his sacrilege in committing those murders on  Palm Sunday  his bowels were to be burnt and finally his body was to be quar∣tered and hung in different parts of the kingdom because he had in different parts conspired the death of the king  Carte ii    WE find nothing more of this place till the year the first of  Edward  III  Dugdale Baron i  when  Robert  the last baron of  Montalt  for want of issue passed this manor and his other great pos∣sessions to  Isabel  the queenmother but on her disgrace it fell again to the crown  IN the king granted the stewartship of  Chester  GRANTED TO THE EARL OF SALIS∣BURY  with  Hawarden c  to  William Montacute  earl of  Salisbury  but as  Isabel  retained a lifeinterest in the grant he procured her re∣lease of it for the sum of six hundred marks It continued in his family till the death of his great nephew  John  earl of  Salisbury  who was beheaded by the townsmen of  Cirencester  after an un∣successful insurrection in in favor of  Richard  II his de∣posed master  Salisbury  had before granted his estates in fee to  Thomas Mountague  dean of  Sarum Lodowick de Clifford John Venour  and  Richard Hertcombe  and their heirs but after his attainder by act of parlement th  Henry  IV they became for∣feited to the king  IN it was granted    by patent from  Henry  IV to his second son  Thomas  duke of  Clarence  but in the d of  Henry  V  Thomas  earl of  Salisbury  son to  John  petitioned for annulling the former sentence his suit was referred to another  parlement and then dismissed  Henry  then made to  Clarence  ano∣ther grant in which the former was declared to be invalid In this the advowson of the living is also given  CLARENCE was slain at the battle of  Baugy    in and died without issue  Hawarden  returned to  Henry  V and from him to his son  Henry  VI who in  TO SIR THOMAS STANLEY  granted it to Sir  Thomas Stanley  comptroller of his houshold and to the heirs male of his body but in it was resumed and in the next year granted together with  Mold  to  Edward  prince of  Wales  On this occasion  John Hertcombe  clamed  Hawarden  as heir to the last survivor of the four feoffees he alledging that  John  earl of  Salisbury  was not possessed of  Hawarden  at the time of his for∣feiture and on this plea obtained a privy seal to enquire into it An inquisition was taken his plea was found to be good and restitution was made This  John Hertcombe  levied a fine to Sir  Richard Strangeways  knight c and  John Needham  to the use of  John Needham  and his heirs  IN a fine was levied to  Richard Nevill  earl of  Salisbury  and  Alice  his wife daughter to  Thomas Montacute  the great earl of  Salisbury  and Sir  Thomas Stanley  knight afterwards lord  Stanley  He had married  Elinor  daughter of  Richard  earl of  Warwick  to the use of  Thomas Stanley  and the heirs male of his body on condition that if  Thomas Stanley  do fell or suffer dis∣continuance or if he die without issue male it is lawful for the said  Richard  earl of  Salisbury  or the heirs of  Alice  his wife to reenter On the death of Lord  Stanley  the fee descended to his son and heir  Thomas  afterwards earl of  Derby  and after  his decease to his second wife  Margaret  countess of  Richmond  and mother to  Henry  VII That monarch in honored the place with a visit and made some residence here for the amusement of stag hunting but his primary motive was to soothe the earl her husband after the ungrateful execution of his brother Sir  William Stanley  ON the death of  Margaret Hawarden  desended to  Thomas  earl of  Derby  granson to the late earl and continued in his fa∣mily till the execution of the gallant  James  earl of  Derby  in soon after his death it was purchased from the agents of sequestration by serjeant  Glynne  On the restoration the Lords made an order on the th of  July  that the earl of  Derby  's and several other lords estates which had been sold in the late usurpation without their consents should be repossessed by them without molestation  Drake  's Parlem Hist xxii  This induced  Glynne  to make an offer to the earl of the surrender of  Hawarden  for a lease of three lives  Account communicated to me by Sir  John Glynne  The proposal was either rejected or not imme∣diately accepted the consequence of which was the loss of the whole to the  Derby  family The Lords resentful of the indigni∣ties their order had experienced in the late troubles began with an attempt to obtain reparation to one of the greatest sufferers In the  December  of the same year they sent down to the Com∣mons a private bill for the restoring to  Charles  earl of  Derby  all the manors lands  c  which belonged to his late father This was strongly opposed and the bill was laid aside without  Drake xxiii  ever coming to a second reading  Drake xxiii  The earl was then glad to compound with the serjeant for the property of this place and granted it to him and his heirs in whom it still remains  IT appears by these proceedings as if the parlement was fearful of the consequences of even an act of justice for during the long troubles there had been such vast change of property effected by fuch variety of means that it was apprehended that the enquiry into the causes and the dispossession of numbers who had quietly enjoyed such property from their fathers might be attended with the most inflammatory consequences It is likewise probable that many of the members might be interested in the event therefore were determined to stop at once any proceeding that might tend to affect the fortunes of themselves or friends Numbers of sales were made by the loyalists them∣selves under the influence of fear They were content to receive a trifle for the purchase rather than lose the whole by violence for there were very few who had not incurred a premunire under the ruling powers which they were glad to get clear of by a seemingly voluntary sale When they were thus disappointed in the hope of reenjoyment of their fortunes they laid the blame on the king and invented the calumny of his rejecting this bill after it had been passed unanimously by both houses  DURING the civil wars this cattle suffered the usual vicissi∣tudes of fortune It was firft possessed by the parlement and kept for its use till the year  BESIEGED IN  at which time a cessation of arms being agreed to on the part of the king with the  Irish  rebels a number of the forces were drawn from  Ireland  and landed at Mostyn in this county in the month of  November  These were immediately employed to reduce the castle of  Hawar∣den  The garrison received by a trumpet a verbal summons which gave occasion to the following letters between lieutenantcolonel  Marrow  and  John Warren  and  Alexander Elliot  the com∣manders on the part of the parlement I omit the immediate answer to the summons written in the religious strain affected by the party which  Marrow  replies to like a true  Cavalier  GENTLEMEN  IT is not for to hear you preach that I am sent here but in his majestie's name to demand the castle for his majestie's use as your allegiance binds you to be true to him and not to enveigle those innocent souls that are within with you so I desire your resolution whether you will deliver the castle or no  The rejoinder from the castle was to this effect  SIR  WE have cause to suspect your disaffection to preaching in regard we find you thus employed If there be innocent souls here God will require their blood of them that shed it We can keep our allegiance and the castle too and therefore you may take your answer as it was in  English  plain enough be∣fore we can say no more but God'S will be done  Rustworth II

quarter I am now with my Firelocks who never yet neglected oppor∣tunity to correct rebels ready to use you as I have done the  Irish  but loth I am to spill my countrymen's blood where∣fore by these I advise you to your feilty and obedience towards his majesty and shew yourselves faithfull subjects by deliver∣ing the castle into my hands for his majesty's use in so doing you shall be received into mercy  c  otherwise if you put me to the least trouble or loss of blood to force you expect no quarter for man woman or child I hear you have some of our late  Irish  army in your company they very well know me and that my Firelocks use not to parley Be not unadvised but think of your liberty for I vow all hopes of relief are taken from you and our intents are not to starve you but to batter and storm you and then hang you all and follow the rest of that rebellious crew I am no breadandcheese rogue but as ever a loyalist and will ever be while I can write or name  Nov  THOMAS SANDFORD Captain

ALL this eloquence would have been flung away had not more forces on the side of the king and want of provisions on that of the garrison cooperated with this valiant epistle So as  Rushworth  says  after a fortnight's siege and much ink and little blood spilt the castle being in want of provisions was surrendered to Sir  Michael Earnley  on condition to march out with half arms and two pair of colors one flying and the other furled and to have a convoy to  Wem  or  Nantwyche  THE royalists Kept possesson or it till after the surrender of  Chester  to Sir  William Brereton  in  AGAIN IN

pains laid open by the removal of the rubbish In one place was discovered a long flight of steps at the bottom of which was a door and for∣merly a drawbridge which crossed a deep long chasm nicely faced with freestone to another door leading to two or three small rooms Probably they were places of confinement where pri∣soners might be lodged with the utmost security after pulling up the bridge over the deep chasm that intervened between them and open day  THE several parts of this fortress seem to have been built at different times It is surrounded with deep fosses now filled with trees In the timber of the park and demesne was valued at five thousand pounds and was sold in that century but the present owner will have the merit of restoring it many∣fold to the next by the vast

his best manner The attitudes are fine and the lights and shadows most admirably disposed They are half lengths a size that his great model excelled in  AMONG the family portraits are two of the chief justice  Glyme  the able political lawyer of the reign of  Charles  I and the succeeding usurpation He was of the house of  Glynllivon  in  Caernarvonshire  which derives itself from  CilminTroedddu  or  Cilmin  with the black foot one of the fifteen tribes and co∣temporary with and nephew to  Merfyn Frych  prince of  Wales  in the year  SIR JOHN GLYNNE was born at  Glynllivon  in the year  CHIEF JUSTICE GLYNNE  his father was Sir  William Glynne  knight his mother a  Griffith  of  Caernarvon  His education was after the best mode His  school was that of the college at  Westminster  his academic learning was instilled into him at  Hartball Oxford  and his knowlege of the law at  Lincoln'sInn  where he became a bencher His abilities were immediately discovered by the popular party by whose in∣fluence he was made steward of  Westminster  recorder of  London  and twice elected member for the former in the two parlements of He was next to  Pym  the most active manager against the earl of  Strafford  The unfortunate peer remarked that  Glynne  and  Maynard  treated him like advocates  Palmer  and  Whitelock  like gentlemen and yet omitted nothing material that could be urged against him  Whitelock  The author of  Hudibras  seems to catch at this part of the character of these two great lawyers  Did not the learned  Glynne  and  Maynard  To make good subjects traitors strain hard  IN the case of  Strafford  and in that of the impeachment of the twelve bishops they acted on principle This appears evident from the prosecution they afterwards underwent for the noble stand they made against the ruin of the constitution planned and afterwards effected by the army On  September  the th they were expelled the house committed to the Tower and had a charge of hightreason brought against them  Parliament Hist xvi    Glynne  soon de∣termined to submit to the rising powers In the next year he was restored to his place in the house appointed one of the ten  THE JUSTICE GLYNNE  commissioners for carrying on the treaty with the king in the isle of  Wight  and voted by the house to be a serjeant at law in the new call it thought fit to make He as well as the artful  Whitelock  evaded all concern in trial of the king but after∣wards temporized fully with the powers in being  Cromwel  soon made him one of his council In he was constituted cham∣berlain of  Chester  in the following year was on the refusal of the chief justice  Rolles  sent into the west with a commission to try colonel  Penruddock  and the other insurgents  Athenae Oxon ii    Rolles  lost his place for his scruples and in his room the serjeant was re∣warded with the office of lord chief justice of the upper bench He was grateful to his patron for being appointed of the committee to receive the protector's scruples about being made king he urged the acceptance with the utmost zeal It is amusing to compare the change of sentiment from the year when the kingly office was voted to be unnecessary burthensome and dangerous with the opinion of when the learned serjeant tells  Cromwel  that it is essential to the settlement of the nation  Parliament Hist xxi  Notwithstanding the usurper did not dare to assume the name he mimicked the powers and honored his advocate with calling him up by writ into his house of peers that motley assembly of the year The prudent lawyer maintained his ground till the year of the restoration when by a masterpiece of cunning he published in octavo the arguments he had used to prevale with his former master to mount the throne under the title of MONARCHY  asserted to be the best the most antient and  legal form of government How flattering must this have been to the rightful prince to find the antient mode acknowleged as most eligible even after the long abuse of it in his family by one of the ablest supporters of the protectorate  WHETHER this recommended him to the new government or whether he had made his peace before is not certain He was received by  Charles  with distinguished marks of favor who not only knighted him but bestowed on him the honor of prime ser∣jeant and even created his eldest son a baronet In the convention parlement he was elected for the county of  Caer∣narvon  and was appointed one of the committee for examining the acts passed during the late usurpation which were inconsist∣ent with the present government and how the many fines reco∣veries  c  made in the late courts of law might be confirmed and rendered good He had likewise a concern in the act of general pardon and in all others in which the assistance of an able lawyer was requisite  Drake's  Parlem Hist xxii    He retired from the house in the following parlement and lived till the year when he died in  London  and

Egerton  lord  Ellesmere  who preferred it out of affection to his mother a native of this village  ANOTHER circumstance leads me to name this parish humi∣liating as it is to a  Welshman  for at

Chester  the land rises suddenly On the lefthand of the ascent are considerable hollows with correspondent elevations one has the appearance of a round bastion which makes me conjecture that they

err greatly from the right name  Caer Lleon  CAER LLEON  the camp of the legion  Caer Lleon vawr ar ddyfr Dwy  the camp of the great legion on the  Dee  being the head quar∣ters of the twentieth legion styled also  Valeria  and  Victrix  This legion came into  Britain  before the year for it had share in the defeat of  Boadicea  by  Suetonius  After this victory the  Roman  forces were led towards the borders of  North Wales  probably into this county Afterwards by reason of the relaxed state of discipline a wing had been cut off by the  Ordovices  just before the arrival of  Agricola  but the quarters of these troops at this period are not exactly known It is probable that part at lest were on the  Deva  that he collected a few of his forces and began his march against the enemy from this place and that after his successful expedition into  Mona  MONA c  he determined to six here a garrison as the fittest place to bridle the warlike people he was about to leave behind him In consequence he fixed part of the legion here and detachments in the neigh∣boring posts before he ventured on the distant expedition to  Scotland  into which he led part as appears from the inscrip∣tions which prove that a  vexillatio  of this legion was concerned in building a portion of the  Roman  wall In order to encou∣rage the troops he left behind he formed here a colony and the place was styled from them and from its situation  DIVANAS  Colonia Devana  as is proved by the coin of  Septimus Geta  son of  Severus  which was thus inscribed  COL DEVANA  leg  xx VICTRIX  IT was also called simply  Deva  AND DEVA  from the river which washe  one side  The antient hallowed DEE  THE form of the city evinces the origin to have been  Roman  FOURS CHIEF STREETS  being in the figure of their camps with four gates four prin∣cipal streets and variety of lesser crossing the others at right angles dividing the whole into lesser squares The walls the precincts of the present city mark the limits of the antient No part of the old walls exist but they stood like the modern on the soft freestone rock high above the circumjacent country and  escarpe  on every front  THE structure of the four principal streets is without parallel They run direct from east to west and north to south and were excavated out of the earth and sunk many feet beneath the surface  EXCAVATED  The carriages are driven far below the level of the kitchens on a line with ranges or shops over which on each side of the streets passengers walk from end to end se∣cure from wet or heat in galleries or  rowe  as they are called purloined from the first floor of each house open in front and balustraded The backcourts of all these houses are level with the rows but to go into any of these four streets it is ne∣cessary to descend a flight of several steps  THESE rows appear to me to have been the same with the antient  vestibules  and to have been a form of building preserved from the time that the city was possessed by the  Romans  They were built before the doors midway between the streets and the  houses and were the places where dependents waited for the coming out of their patrons  De signif vocab    and under which they might walk away the tedious minutes of expectation  Plautus  in the third act of his  Mostella  describes both their situation and use  Viden' vestibulum ante aedes et ambulacrum ejusmodi  The shops beneath the rows were the  cryptae  and  apothecae  ma∣gazines for the various necessaries of the owners of the Houses  The streets were once considerably deeper as is apparent from the shops whose floors lie far below the present pavement In digging foundations for houses the  Roman  pavement is often dis∣covered at the depth of four feet beneath the modern The lesser streets and allies which run into the principal streets sloped to the bottoms of the latter as is particularly visible in were  Bridge Street  but these are destiture of the galleries or rows  IT is difficult to assign a reason for these hollowed ways  GREAT VAULTS  An antient historian mentions the existence in his days of certain vaults and passages of which not a trace nor even the lest memory is left notwithstanding the most diligent search and enquiries have been made  In this cyte  says the author of the  Poly∣chronicen ben ways under erthe with vowtes and stone werke wonder∣ly wrought thre chambred werkes Grete stones I grave with olde  mennes names therin There is also  JULIUS CEZAR'S  name wonderly in stones grave and other noble mennes names also with the wrytynge about  meaning the altars and monumental inscriptions but he probably mistakes the name of  Julius Caesar  for that of  Julius Agricola  to whom it is reasonable to suppose some grateful memorial was erected Unless these hollowed streets were formed by the void left after the destruction of these great vaults I can no more account for their formation than for the place which those antient  Souterrains  occupied  NEW LO  T  None have ever been discovered by the frequent sinking of cellars for new buildings on the site of the old tradition has delivered no such accounts to us nor is their exit to be traced beneath the walls in any part of their circumference The only vaults now known are of a middle age and which belonged either to the  hotels  of the great men or to the religious houses dispersed through the city  OF the four gates of the city  EAST GATE ROMAN  one of them the  East gate  continued till of late years of  Roman  architecture and consist∣ed of two arches much hid by a tower erected over it in the later days A few years ago it was pulled down on account of its straitness and inconveniency to give way to a magnifi∣cent gate which rose in its place by the munificence of lord  Grosvenor  I remember the demolition of the antient structure and on the taking down the more modern case of  Norman  ma∣sonry the  Roman  appeared full in view  IT consisted of two arches formed of vast stones fronting the  Eastgate  street and the  Forest  street the pillar between them dividing the street exactly in two The accurate repre∣sentation  of them by Mr  Wilkinson  of this city will give a stronger idea of them than words can convey as also of the figure of the  Roman  soldier placed between the tops of the arches facing the  Forest  street  THIS species of double gate was not unfrequent The  Porta esquilina  Montfaucon  III part ii p  and the  Porte portese  Nardini Roma Anticha p  at  Rome  were of this kind  Flores  in his medals of the  Roman  colonies in  Spain  P tab xxixxiixxiii  exhibits one on the coins of  Merida  the antient  Emerita  particularly on those of  Augustus  which shews that the colonists were proud of their gate and perhaps not without reason as it appears to have been the work of the best age I must conclude that the mode seems to have been derived from the  Grecian  architec∣ture for at  Athens  stood a  Dipylon  or double gate now demo∣lished  As I have been informed by my friend Mr  Stuart    THE gate in question faced the great  Watling street road  and near the place where other military ways united Through this was the greatest conflux of people which rendered the use of the double portal more requisite  THE  Roman  bath beneath the  Feathers Inn  HYPOCY  in  Bridge street  is probably still entire but the only part which can be seen by reason of the more modern superstructures is the  Hypocaust  This is of a rectangular figure supported by thirtytwo pillars two feet ten inches and a half high and about eighteen inches distant from each other Upon each is a tile eighteen inches  square as if designed for a capital and over them a perforated tile two feet square Such are continued over all the pillars Above these are two layers one of coarse mortar mixed with small red gravel about three inches thick and the other of finer materials between four and five inches thick these seem to have been the floor of the room above The pillars stand on a mortarfloor spread over the rock On the south side between the middle pillars is the vent for the smoke about six inches square which is at present open to the height of sixteen inches Here is also an antichamber exactly of the same extent with the  Hypocaust  with an opening in the middle into it This is sunk near two feet below the level of the former and is of the same rectangular figure so that both together are an exact square This was the room allotted for the slaves who attended to heat the place the other was the receptacle of the fuel de∣signed to heat the room above the  concamerata sudatio  Vitruvius  lib v c II  or sweatingchamber where people were seated either in niches or on benches placed one above the other during the time of the operation Such was the object of this Hypocaust for there were others of different forms for the purposes of heating the waters destined for the use of the bathers  I MUST now descend towards the bridge in search of the few further reliques of the antient colonists After passing through the gate on the right near some skinners houses is a small flight of steps which lead to a large round arch seemingly of  Roman  workmanship It is now filled with more modern ma∣sonry  and a passage left through a small arch of a very eccentric form  ANTIENT POS∣TERN  On the left within the very passage is the appearance of another round arch now filled up This postern is called the  Shipgate  or  Hole in the Wall  THIS seems originally designed for the common passage over the  Dee  into the country of the  Ordovices  either by means of a boat at highwater or by fording at low the river here being re∣markably shallow What reduces this to a certainty is that the rock on the  Hanbridge  side is cut down as if for the conveniency of travellers And immediately beyond in the field called  Ed∣gar  's are the vestiges of a road pointing up the hill  ROMAN ROAD  and which we shall have hereafter occasion to say was continued toward  bonium  the present  Bangor  IN a front of a rock in the same field and facing this relique of the  Roman  road is cut a rude figure of the  Dea armigera  MINERVA with her bird and altar  SCULPTURE OR MINERVA  This probably was a se∣pulchral monument for such were very usual on the sides of highways but time or wantonness has erased all inscription  BEYOND this stood past all memory some antient buildings whose site is marked by certain hollows for the ground pro∣bably over the vaults gave way and fell in within the remem∣brance of persons now alive Tradition calls the spot the site of the palace of  Edgar  Nothing is now left from which any judgment can be formed whether it had been a  Roman  build∣ing as Doctor  Stukeley  surmises or  Saxon  according to the pre∣sent notion or  Norman  according to  Braun  Civitates Ortis  iii pl This work was published in  who in his antient  plan of this city styles the ruins then actually existing  Ruinosa domus Comitis Cestriensis  Perhaps it might have been used succes∣sively by every one who added or improved according to their respective national modes  HAVING had occasion to mention the name of a departed an∣tiquary I think fit to acknowlege my obligations for the many hints I have benefitted by from the travels of that great and lively genius but at the same time lament that I must say I often find him  Plus beau que la  VERITE His rapid fancy led him too frequently to paint things as he thought they ought to be not what they really were In the subject before us this asser∣tion may be supported by his giving three arches to the antient  East gate  and hollow ways to every part of the city where search has been made  THE beautiful altar  ALTAR  in possession of Mr  Dyson  and the soldier in the garden or Mr  Lawton  are the only pieces of detached antiquities now ramaining in this city The first is of great elegance and was erected by  Flavius Longus  tribune of the twentieth victorious legion and his son  Longinus  in honor of the emperors  and  Maximian  The father and son who thus expressed their gratitude were of  Samosata  a city of  Syria  On one side is the inscription on the opposite is a cur∣tain with a festoon above On one of the narrower sides is a genius with a  cornucopia  and on the other is a pot with a plant of the supposed  acanthus  elegantly leaved On the summit is a head included in a circular garland I fogot to remark that immediately over the inscription is a globe overtopped with palmleaves If this is not a general compliment to their  victories I should imagine it designed to express their particu∣lar successes in  Africa  of which the palmtree was a known emblem  THIS was found in digging for a cellar near the  Eastgate  on the antient pavement which consisted of great stones Around it were found the marks of sacrifice heads horns and bones of the ox roebuck  c  and with them two coins one of  Vespasian  in brass with his head inscribed IMP CAES VESP AUG COSS III and on the reverse VICTORIA AUGUSTI S C and a winged Victory standing The other was of copper in∣scribed round the head of  Constantius  FL VAL CONSTANTIUS NOB C and on the other side GENIO POPULI ROMANI allud∣ing to a genius holding in one hand a sacrificing bowl in the other a  cornucopia  THE other antiquities discovered here are now dispersed which obliges me to have recourse to books in order to place them in one point of view  THE first is the noted altar discovered in  ANOTHER  at present preserved at  Oxford  It is inscribed to  Jupiter  with the  British  epithet  Tanarus  or the Thunderer by the transposal of the let∣ters  r  and  n  in the word  Taran  This appears to have been complimentary to the  Britons  by adopting the epithet in their language instead of that of  Tonans  The inscription approved most by Mr  Horsely  Tab N  o  iii  runs thus  Jovi  optimo maximo Tanaro  Titus Elupius Galeria  Praesens  Guntia  Primipilus  Legionis vicessimae Valentis  Victricis  Commodo  et  Laterano  Consalibus votum solvit  Lubens merito  THE word  Guntic  in the learned  Prideaux  and  Gale  Gale's Comm  is read  Gunethae  as if derived from  Gwinedd  one of the  British  names of  North Wales  over which they suppose  Elupius  had presided This might account for his preference of the word  Tanaro  as highly flattering to the vanity of those he governed  THE next is a statue in possession of the late Reverend Mr  Prescot  STATUE or MI∣THRAS  with a  Phrygian  bonnet on his head a little mantle cross his shoulders and a short jacket on his body He is placed standing with a torch in his hands declining This is supposed to have been  Mithras  or the sun a deity borrowed from the  Persians  and much in vogue among the  Romans  in the second and third century  Horsely Cumberland  An inscription DEO SOLI MITRAE has been discovered in  Cumberland  The  Phrygian  bonnet marks him for a foreign deity The declining torch shews the fune∣brious occasion of this stone  MR HORSELY mentions another stone discovered in digging a cellar in  Watergate street  in The inscription is so im∣perfect that he ingenuously confesses that without the aid of fancy it cannot be made out  A FEW bricks with the number of the legion stationed here fill the list of the  Roman  antiquities of the place I say nothing of the inscription DEAE NYMPHAE BRIGANTES preserved by Mr  Gale  it being justly disputed whether it belonged to this place  I MUST not omit the most valuable memorial which the  Ro∣mans  left  CHEESEMAKING  in a particular manner to this county the art of cheesemaking for we are expressly told that the  Britons  were ignorant of it till the arrival of the  Romans  The  Cestrians  have improved so highly in this article as to excel all coun∣tries not excepting that of  Italy  the land of their antient masters  THE twentieth legion was recalled from  Britain  before

before the retreat of the  Romans  from this island its name being found at  Bath  among some of the latest inscriptions we have  Idem  The city must not at that period be supposed to be totally deserted it remained oc∣cupied by the descendants of the legionaries who partook of the same privileges and were probably a numerous body Num∣bers likewise who had married with the native islanders and embraced civil employs in all likelihood stayed behind after the final abdication of  Britain  by the legions in After this the city fell under the government of the  Britons  till their conquest was entirely effected by the new invaders the  Saxons  BRITAIN  SAXON PERIOD  now left defenceless quickly experienced all the calamities that could be inflicted on it from a oreign and bar∣barous people While  Hengist  and  Horsa  poured in their troop  upon the south another set of  Banaitli  landed in  Wales  from their settlements in the  Orcades  and the north of  tland  These with their allies the  Picts  were defeated near  Mold  by the Christian  Britons  headed by St  Germanus  I mention this out of course merely to shew that the probable rest that  Deva  enjoyed for another century was owing to this victory which obtained seemingly in a miraculous manner discouraged for a long space any new attempts  THE fate of this city was at length decided in  Sax Chren    ETHELFRID  when  Ethelfrid  king of  Northumbria  resolved to add this rich tract to his dominions He was opposed by  Brochmail Yscithroc  king of  Pa  is  who collected hastily a body of men probably de∣pending on the intervention of Heaven as in the case of the  victoria allelutanca  BATTLE OF CHES∣TER  for that end he called to his aid one thou∣sand two hundred religious from the great convent of  Banger  and posted them on a hill in order that he might benefit by the  prayers  Ethelfrid  fell in with this pious corps and finding what their business was  Bede Hist ii c a  put them to the sword without mercy He made an easy conquest of  Brochmail  who as the  Saxon  chronicle  P  informs us escaped with about fifty men It appears that  Eth  d  after pillaging the city left it to the former owners and contented himself with the territory till it was wrest  l  his kingdom by that of Merita  WE are left unacquainted with the history of this city for a long period The  Britons  seem to have continued in possession of it and it was considered to be the capital city of  Venedotia  or  North Wales  till it was finally wrested out of their hands by  Egbert  EGBERT  about the year during the reign of the  British  prince  Mervyn  and his wife  Esylht  Powel  which contracted the limits of  Wales  during the remainder of its independent existence  IN a few years after it underwent a heavy calamity from the  Danes  THE DANES WIN∣TER HERE  These pirates the scourge of the kingdom meeting with a severe defeat by  Alfred the Great  retreated before him and in their slight collecting vast numbers of their countrymen committed the care of their wives their ships and their booty to the  East Angles  marched night and day to secure quarters in the west They seized on  Legaceaster  before

turbulent nobleman who engaging in rebellion aided by the  Welsh  prince  Gryffydd ap Llewelŷn  was twice deprived of his earl∣dom and was once pardoned After his second deprivation he obtained again

had taken possession of his new territories and by reason of a long captivity was obliged to resign them to ano∣ther The Conqueror in his place appointed  Hugh de Aurange  better known by the name of  Hugh Lupus  the first  Norman  earl of  Chester  who ever possessed the county To him he dele∣gated a fulness of power made his a  county palatine  and gave it such a sovereign jurisdiction that the antient earls kept their own parlements and had their own courts of law in which any offence against the dignity of the sword of  Chester  was as cognizable here as the like offence would have been at  Westminster  against the dignity of the royal crown for  William  allowed  Lupus  to hold this county  tam liberè ad gladium sicut ipse  REX  tenebat  Angliam  d coronam  The sword by which he was invested with this dignity is still to be seen in the  Museum  inscribed  Hugo comes Cestriae  Another inferior office was also held by the earls by virtue of this sword that of swordbearer of  England  at the times of coronation  Leicester    LUP  S instantly took possession of his dominions It is probable that he was invested in them by  William  himself for we find the Conqueror at  Chester  in person in where he repelled the  Welsh  and finally reduced the  Mercian  province which appears to have been in arms to this period  Ordericus vitalis lib iv p  At the same time restored  the walls and built the castle the former having either fallen into decay since the days of  Ethelfreda  or were not thought suffi∣ciently strong for the exigencies of the times  As soon as  Lupus  was firmly established he began to exert his regal prerogatives He formed his parlement by the crea∣tion of eight barons  viz Nigel  baron of  Halton Robert  of  Montalt William Malbedeng  baron of  Nantwich Vernon  of  Shipbrook Fitzhugh  of  Malpas Hamon de Massie Venables  of  Kinderton  and  Nicholas  of  Stockport  These were to assist the earl with their advice  Ego comes  HUGO  et mei  BARONES was the form of his writs They were obliged to pay him attend∣ance and to repair to his court to give it the greater dignity They were bound in time of war with  Wales  to find for every knight'sfee a horse with caparison and furniture or two with∣out furniture in the division of  Cheshire  Their knights and freeholders were to have corselets and habergeons and were to defend their lands with their own bodies Every baron had also four esquires every esquire one gentleman and every gen∣tleman one valet  Erdeswicke  's MSS quoted by Doctor  Gower  p  Each of these barons had also their free courts of all pleas and suits and all plaints except what be∣longed to the earl's  sword  They had besides power of life and death The last instance of the exertion of this power was in the person of  Hugh Stringer  who was tried for murder in the baron of  Kinderton  's court and executed in  Doctor  Gower  's materials  c  p    THE earls had their chamberlain which supplied the place of chancellor an office continued to this day The first we  know of was  Philippus Camerarius  who took his name from his office in the time of  Randle Gernouns  earl of  Chester  Here is a baron of the exchequer and other officers conformable to those of the crown at  Westminster  also justices before whom the causes which of their nature should otherwise belong respectively to the courts of king'sbench and commonpleas are triable  Leicester    IN imitation of regal power the earls appointed a high con∣stable of  Cheshire  correspondent to the high constable of  Eng∣land  which was held in fee by the baron of  Halton  who by virtue of this office took place of the other barons and the baron of  Montalt  had precedency after him by virtue of his office in fee of high steward  ROBERT DE ROTHELENT was another baron who was com∣mander in chief of the forces in  Cheshire  and prime governor of the county under his cousin  Hugh Lupus  As his office and rank dropt with him he is not reckoned among the barons Probably the office was found unnecessary and clashing with the priveleges of the high constable  THIS species of government continued from the Conquest till the reign of  Henry  III a period of about years when in on the death of  John Scot  the seventh earl of the  Norman  line without issue male  Henry  took the earldom into his own hands and gave the daughters of the late earl other lands in lieu unwilling as we said that so great an inheritance should  be parcelled out among distaffs  THE EARLDOM RESUMED BY THE CROWN  The king bestowed the coun∣ty  on his son  Edward  who did not assume the title which he afterwards bestowed on his son  Edward  of  Caernarvon  first  English  prince of  Wales  AFTER the resumption of the earldom by the crown the government of the city assumed a new form for in the year the th of  Henry  III it appears to have first been under the directions of a mayor and sheriffs The mayor seems to have been the substitute for the constable an office which during the period of the  Norman  earls was under them supreme in all matters military and civil in both city and county The sheriffs seem to have been a new name for bailiffs who acted under the former  Vale royal    AFTER giving a general idea of the state of this place and county to the time of  Henry  III I shall return to the time of  Hugh Lupus  and give to the best of my power a brief chronolo∣gical account of its history leaving the ecclesiastical part to be treated apart  IN the days of that potent earl and probably long before he was possessed of this city it enjoyed by prescription divers priveleges  GUILD MIRCA∣TORY  It had a  guild mercatory  Ibid  analogous to a modern corporation so that no person who was not of that society could exercise any trade or carry on any commerce within its pre∣cinct Such was the state in which the  Normans  found it which the earls afterwards confirmed under their seals  Two overseers selected out of the most respectable citizens were appointed to maintain the rights of this  guild  They re∣ceived  for the use of the city all the customs paid by strangers unless at the fairs which in those days were said to have been held three times in the year These officers were probably of the same nature as the deans of  guild  in  Scotland  It appears also from the Doomsday book that here was a supreme officer called the  Prapesitus Regis  or provost who had the care both of the civil and commercial interests  IT is difficult to say at this time what were the articles of ex∣portation excepting slaves and horses  EXPORTS SLAVES  The first barbarous traffic was carried on by the  Saxons  to a great height The de∣scription of the mart is an exact picture of the  negro  commerce  THERE is a town called  Brichstou Bristol  opposite to  Ireland  and ex∣tremely convenient for trading with that country  Wulfstan  induced them to drop a barbarous custom which neither the love of God nor the king could prevale on them to lay aside This was the mart for slaves collected from all parts of  England  and particularly young women whom they took care to provide with a pregnancy in order to

their exportation was pro∣hibited excepting they were designed for presents by a law of  Athelstan  But these as well as several others such as metals hides dogs and chalk were probably still exported as in the  times of the  Romans Chester  was admirably situated for supplying all these articles excepting the last The frequent wars carried on with the  Welsh  furnished them with slaves if those were wanting their neighbors of the  Northumbrian  kingdom were ready to dispose of their nearest relations  Willielm Malmesh  in script post  Bedam p  The rich plains of  Cheshire  furnished horns

the  Roman  reign there was great exportation of cheeses for the use of the  Roman  armies in which this county doubtlessly had the greatest share  THE imports were the spices and other luxuries of

Skinnes of otter squirrel and  Irish  hare  Of sheepe lambe and foxe is her chaffare  Felles of kiddes and conies great plentie  It is certain that  Chester  had long been a celebrated port It appears to have been a station for the  Saxon  navy and fre∣quently the seat of the court of the  Mercian  kingdom both during the Heptarchy and after it became a province at the general union under  Egbert  THE state of this city in the time of  Edward  the Confessor and at the Conquest must be collected from the famous survey the  Doomsday  book  IT appears that in the time of the  Saxon  monarch here were four hundred and thirtyone houses which were taxable besides fiftysix that belonged to the bishop that it yielded ten marks of silver and a half two parts to the king and the third to the earl that whenever the king came in person he clamed from every ploughland two hundred  hesthas  one  cuna  of ale and one  rusca  of butter  Hestha  is supposed to be a capon  cuna  brewing tub or vat I do not find  rusca  explained  that if any persons made bad ale they were either to sit in a chair full of dung or pay four shilings that there were twelve judges in the city and seven mintmasters that whenever repairs were wanting for the walls or the bridge notice was given for one man out of every hideland in the county to appear and in case of absence he was fined forty shillings to be divided between the king and the earl and that the city was so depopulated at the time that  Hugh Lupus  took possession that there were two hun∣dred and five houses fewer than in the time of the Con∣fessor  IT is probable that the city soon emerged from its calamities and felt a considerable increase under its new masters a more polished race for the  Normans  affected as much elegance in their dress and their buildings as they did temperance in their meat and drink The example of a magnificent warrior such as the new earl was quickly copied His court and that of his successors rendered it the most considerable place in these parts  ACCORDING to  Lucian  Quoted by  Cambden  i  a jolly monk who flourished about the time of the Conquest its commerce was very considerable He speaks of the ships  coming from  Gascoign Spain Ireland  and  Germany  who by GOD'S assistance and by the labour and conduct of mariners repair hither and supply them with all sorts of commodities so that being comforted with the favour of GOD in all things  we drink wine plentifully  for those countries have abundance of vineyards  HERE    in  Henry  II and  Malcolm  the IVth of  Scot∣land  had

   BALDWIN archbishop of  Canterbury    in visited this place in his road from  Wales  where his zeal led him to recom∣mend the  Croisade  to the mountaneers assisted by the eloquent and vain  Giraldus  All the historian takes notice of in this re∣spectable city is that  Constance  countess of  Chester  kept a herd of milch hinds made cheeses of their milk and presented three to the archbishop that he saw an animal a compound of an ox and a stag a woman born without arms who could sew as well with her feet as others of her sex did with their fingers and finally that he heard of a litter of whelps begotten by a monkey  Itin Cambr c xi p  As  Giraldus  was a great dealer in presages it is wondrous he made no use of all these portents probably no  signal event happened in these parts in his days to which they could be applied  THE next remarkable occurrences were the ravages of  Llewelyn ap Gryffydd    prince of  Wales  who carried fire and sword to the very gates of  Chester  and destroyed every thing around on both sides of the river provoked by the cruel injuries his subjects sustained from  Geffrey Langley  lieutenant of the county under prince  Edward

of this destroyingangel's respect to the female sex was verified here for only four perished  IN    it was followed by the pestilence when such num∣bers died and such numbers fled that the streets of the city were overgrown with grass  IT appears that the citizens of  Chester  were not less celebrated for their dramatic performances than those of  Coventry  Dugdale i      They exhibited two species one formed upon moral romance the other on scriptural history In this year they enacted at the highcross the play of  Robert  kyng of  Cicyle  or  Robert le Dia  borrowed from the  French

to exort the minds of the common people to good deuotion and holsome doctrine but also for the comonwelth of this citty a play and declaration  of divers storyes of the Bible beginning with the

VIII Fortythree years had elapsed since the last performance of this nature when the  Assumption of our Lady  was played before his brother  Arthur  at the abby∣gates of this city  THESE Mysteries were the rude origin of the  English  theatre Our drama as the very ingenious Mr  Warton  remarks was in early times confined entirely to religious subjects and these plays were nothing more than an appendage to the specious and mechanical devotion of the age  History of  English  Poetry i  I refer the reader to that gentleman's amusing history of the rise and progress of these performances and confine myself to a few specimens of the gross and ridicu∣lous exhibitions of the times when the audience listened with  the fullest admiration and devotion to what would at present fill a theatre with laughter from the gay at the absurdity or scandalize the serious part with the unintentional impiety I shall only premise that the scene of action was the church in defiance of the fulminations of the furious  Bonner  and the pious  G  indal  THESE plays were twentyfive in number They were per∣formed for above three centuries to the staring audience who received the unvaried subject with the same annual pleasure as the  Romans  did the farces in their days of honest simplicity  Tandemque redit ad pulpita notum  Exodium cum personae pallentis hiatum  In gremio matris sormidat rusticus

DRYDEN  They do not appear to us in the words of the original deviser but the language and the poetry being grown obsolete they were altered to that of the time for the performance of the year and

Mar∣seilles  ' good bishop kept his station during the whole time of a dreadful pestilence  When nature sickened and each gale was death  HIS house was infected and some of his children and ser∣vants died The court of exchequer was removed to  Tarvin  the  assizes were held at  Namptwich  and the fairs ceased during this sad visitation  IN this year the city was honored with the presence of  James  I where he was received with a magnificence that did honor to the place  The mayor  Edward Button  presented his majesty with a fair standing cup with a cover double gilt and in it a hundred jacobins or gold He also delivered the city's sword to the king who returning it the mayor bore it before him on horseback His worship was offered the honor of knighthood but declined it The city did not confine its munificence to crowned heads I find that in  Robert  earl of  Leicester  chamberlain of the county palatine met with a most honorable reception was received at the highcross by the whole cor∣poration entertained by the mayor and presented with a cup containing forty angels The unfortunate earl of  Essex  in in his way to  Ireland  was still more distinguished He was pre∣sented with the like sum but in a cup of the same kind as that which was afterwards presented to  James  FROM I discover nothing very particular for a consi∣derable space till the city was involved in the calamities of a siege in  in consequence of its unshaken loyalty to  Charles  I At the beginning of the civil war immediate attention was paid to this important city by the royal party The fortifications were put into the best repair and outworks extended from the alcove on the north part of the walls to the brink of the river near  Boughton  and in consequence numbers of houses were pulled down to prevent them from giving shelter to the enemy The first attempt made on the place by the parlement army was  on the th of  July  when Sir  William Brereton  gave a violent assault on the works but met with a repulse In the same year he sent a summons to Sir  Abraham Shipman  then go∣vernor to surrender the gallant commander bid him come and win it and wear it  AFTER the repulse of Lord  Biron  before  Namptwich  the county of  Chester  was almost entirely in the hands of Sir  Wil∣liam Brereton  and the city suffered from that time a sort of blockade from the quarters the enemy possessed in the neighbor∣hood even as near as the village of  Christleton  Sallies and excur∣sions were frequently made and according to the diary of the siege with advantage to the loyalists  ON  September  the th the parlement gained an advan∣tage irrecoverable by the besieged Colonel  Jones  and adjutantgeneral  Lothian  who were employed in the reduction of  Beeston  castle drew from before that place in a secret manner a large body of forces and in the night stormed the outworks and made themselves masters of every thing even to the city walls His majesty immediately after this misfortune passed through  Wales  and got into the city in hopes of animating the garrison and was lodged at Sir  Francis Gamul  's near the bridge He ar∣rived only time enough to be a spectator from the leads of the  Phoenix  tower of the fatal battle on  Rowton  heath on  September  when his forces under Sir  Marmaduke Langdale  then on their march to raise the siege after a welldisputed action sunk under the superior fortune of general  Pointz  THE king continued that night in  Chester  and on quitting it the next day gave orders to the governor lord  Biron  that  in case there was no appearance of relief within eight days he was to treat of a surrender The king took the route of  Denhigh  attended to that town by the three respectable citizens Sir  Francis Gamul  alderman  Cooper  and captain  Thropp  The siege was continued with the utmost vigour by Sir  William Brereton  notwithstanding which the gallant garrison held out for twenty weeks beyond the expectation of every body and after having been reduced to live on horses dogs and cats yielded on the d of  February  on terms that did honor to the spirit of the besieged The city was evacuated by the royalists and received from the parlement as governor colonel  Jones  But the miseries of the citizens did not terminate with the siege a dreadful pestilence broke out in two thousand inhabi∣tants perished and the city became almost a desert  IN order to give a further history of the military  BRIDGE  civil and ecclesiastical architecture of this antient city I return to the bridge This passage was prior to the Conquest at which pe∣riod it seems to have been either destroyed or found to be so much out of repair that I find in  Doomsday book  an or∣der for the provost to summon one man from each hide of land in the county in order to rebuild the bridge and the walls and in case of neglect of appearance the lord of the per∣son so summoned was to forfeit to the king and earl forty shillings  ACCORDING to a MS quoted by Mr  Grose  it was begun by the great restorer of the city  Ethelfieda  and after her death completed by her brother  Edward  Before that time the pas∣sage was by a ferry that plied between the postern called the  Shipgate  and  Edgar  's field It does not appear to me that any part of the  Saxon  bridge remains so frequently has it been re∣paired since that distant period  BENEATH the arch next to the city  CAUSEWAY AND MILLS  is a current which by means of a great dam or causeway that crosses the river obliquely supplies the city mills with water These mills and the cause∣way were originally founded by  Hugh Lupus  Harleian  MSS  and retained by his successors and afterwards by the earls of  Chester  of the royal line I find them often leased by the crown  Edward  the black prince in particular in grants them the fishing suit court and calsey for three years to  Robert  of  Bredone  parson of St  Peter  of  Chester  and others at the annual rent of  l  Idem  This rent was very considerable in those days and arose from the obligation every inhabitant of the city then lay under to grind at these mills excepting the tenants of the abbot and monks of St  Werburgh  and in after times those of the dean and chapter inhabiting without the  Northgate  who had a mill of their own at  Bachpool  I MUST not omit that a grant of these mills for life was the reward of valor to my countryman Sir  Howel y Fwyall  for his bravery in taking prisoner  John  king of  France  in the battle of  Poitiers  This grant was also made by the black prince who not only knighted  Howel  but allowed a mess of meat to be served before his battle ax in memory of the good use he made of it in that day from which he acquired the name of  Fwyall  or  Howei  or the ax  Hist  Gwedir  family Fifteen tribes of  NWales    ON each side of the  Bridgegate  are two rounders  BRIDGEGATE  over it are the three feathers the arms of the princes of  Wales  Those were first assumed by the BLACK PRINCE after the battle of  Cresh  in our historians assert that they were the three ostrichfeathers which the king of  Bohemia  bore that day in his coronet and that he was slain by  Edward  who seizing on the crest bore from that time both the feathers and the motto  I  b dien I serve  I am unwilling to sully the honor of our gallant prince by supposing that he would stain his sword in so unequal an encounter The king was blind with age and finding the battle go against his allies was led by his own orders into the rage of the combat determined to die in the cause of  France  Our brave prince probably might assume this royal cognizance in memory of the glorious day and add to it his own motto  Ic dien  the old  English  for  I serve  allusive to the Scriptural verse  The heir while he is a child differeth not from a servant  Cambden  's Remains  an imprese extremely suitable to the characteristic modesty and filial piety of this prince  THIS and the other city gates were placed under the pro∣tection of certain great men who held lands within the county palatine The earl of  Shrewshury  had the care of the  Bridgegate  the earl of  Oxford  of the  Eastgate  the earl of  Derby  of the  Watergate  But the  Northgate  belonging peculiarly to the city was intrusted only to its chief magistrates Tolls were exacted at entrance from all strangers for the support of the  guard and notwithstanding the cause has long since ceased are still demanded at the  Bridgegate  ABOVE the gate is a lofty octagonal tower  WATERWORKS  begun in by permission of the corporation by  John Tyrer  of this city containing the works which for a long time raised water out of the  Dee  to a cistern in the top whence it was conveyed in pipes to almost all parts of the city Possibly these did not answer their purpose effectually for in  Tyrer  had a new grant of a tower erected for a waterwork and a wellplace ten feet square near  Spittle Boughton  with full powers for the conveyance of the water to the cistern or conduit near the highcross This work which was first begun by the  black friers  in the time of  Edward  I  De aquaeductu per ipsos the black friers faciendo a fonte prope furcas Vide  Tanner    fell to decay In the works undertaken by  Tyrer  being found to be ruinous and useless  John Hopkins  and  John Hadley  by the encouragement of the corporation began new works for supplying the city with water from the river  Dee  for this purpose they purchased the grant made to  Tyrer  and also one of the cornmills for the conveniency of placing their engine The city confirmed to them all the powers formerly vested in  Tyrer  and particularly that of setting up a cistern opposite to the abby court as a constant receptacle for fresh water  NEAR the  Bridgegate  is one ascent to the city walls  WALLS  which are the only entire specimen of antient fortification now in  Great Britain  They are a mile and three quarters and a hun∣dred  and one yards in circumference and being the principal walk of the inhabitants are kept in excellent repair by certain imposts  MURRACE  called murage duties collected at the customhouse upon all goods and merchandize brought into the port of  Chester  from parts beyond the seas belonging to persons not freemen of the city The  Irish  linen adds considerably to the fund be∣ing nearly twothirds of the whole the duty on this article is two pence on every hundred yards The annual receipt of the different duties on the average of the last seven years is about    l  An officer called a murenger is chosen out of the body of the aldermen to inspect the repairs generally an old member to whom the duty affords amusement and health This fund is now permanent in old times the murage was only occasional Thus in the th of  Edward  II there was a grant for two years of a halfpenny for every cranock of corn and a farthing of ale meal and malt and for commodities not expressed in the grant a farthing out of every two shillingsworth  I CANNOT discover any vestige of the original walls such as those which are said to have been restored by the warlike  Ethelfleda  I would not willingly detract from the lady's merit but I must deny her that of being the foundress of the forti∣fications and of enlarging the city beyond the  Roman  precincts The form at present is so entirely  Roman  that any addition she could make would have destroyed the peculiar figure that wise people always preserved in their stations or castrametations where∣soever the nature of the ground would permit The antiquities which distinguish their residence are not found confined to any one quarter they are met in digging on every side within the walls  THE military architecture is still entirely on the  Roman  plan it is probable that after their retreat it fell into ruin in the empoverished turbulent and barbarous ages that succeeded yet never was so totally demolished but that it might still yield a defence to the possessors We find it wrested out of the hands of the  Britons  by  Egbert  in we again see it possessed by the  Danes  in and besieged by  Alfred  who slew all the banditti whom he found  without the walls  and lastly we find it taken by  Ethelfleda  by the voluntary surrender of the garrison All this proves a continuance of the fortifications probably ruinous and wanting that restoration which they found from that illustrious woman  WE see the  Roman  mode of fortification preserved to this day exactly on the antient plan From each side of the gates projects a  propugnaculum  Vegetius  lib iv c  or bastion in order to annoy the ene∣my who attempted to enter and between them in the very entrance was the  cataracta  or portcullis ready to be dropt in case they forced the gates so that part of them might be caught within the walls and the rest excluded Should it happen that they set the gates on fire there were holes above in order to pour down water to extinguish the flames  THE walls are in many parts especially on the north and cast sides guarded by towers placed so as not to be beyond bowshot of one another in order that the archers might reach the enemy who attempted to attack the intervals  Intervalla autem turrium ita sunt facienda ut ne longius sit alia ab alia sagittae intermissione c  Vitruvius  lib i c  They also  are mostly of a round form as was recommended by the  Roman  architects in order the better to elude the force of battering rams  Turres itaque rotundae aut polygoniae sunt faciendae  quadratas  enim ma∣chinae celerius dissipant  c  Ibid Turres sunt projiciendae in exteriorem partem uti cum ad murum hostis im∣petu velit appropinquare a turribus  c  Ibid    THE thickness of the walls answer to the breadth prescribed by  Vitruvius  Only two persons can walk abreast excepting where the ground adjacent gives a larger expanse The great architect directs that they should be of such a breadth that two armed men may pass each other without any impe∣diment  THE city to this time enjoys the four gates answerable to the  principalis dextra sinistra praetoria decumana  The  Eastgate  one of the  principales  existed within my memory  MY walk leads me beneath the castle to another of the  principales  the present  Watergate  that opens towards the water∣side and near which the  Dee  in former times flowed  AT the extreme angle of the city beyond this gate is a salient tower exactly round  WATERTOWER  unless where interrupted by a small squared projection at the entrance This tower is joined to the walls by a deep open gallery embattled on each side beneath is a large arch for the passage of the tide before the late inclo∣sures which also are within my remembrance This tower is at present called the  Watertower  It jutted into the antient chan∣nel or the river where the ships lay which fastened their cables  to its sides by the great iron rings infixed in the stone This tower was formerly called the new yet was founded in for there exists a contract for that purpose between the mayor and citizens of  Chester  and one  John de Helpston  mason for building  quandam turrem rotundum  c a round tower  of the thickness of ten yards and a half with a cavity within twentyfour yards high and so strong as to be defensible  and all this for the sum of one hundred pounds  Harleian MSS N  o      THE next remarkable outlet is the  Northgate  beyond which is a large suburb  THE  Phoenix  tower stands on the angle of the walls beyond this gate The present tower was built in and was used by six of the companies of the city as a chamber for business It took its name from the fabulous bird the crest of the painterstainers company which was placed in front  THE  Eastgate  is the next entrance  EASTGATE  Here stood a lofty square tower with many apartments erected according to tradi∣tion by  Edward  III This had been a  Porta principalis  was the grand entrance into the town and was the termination of the great  Watlingstreet  road which crossed the island from  Dover  and was the great road from that port to this place In this gate being found too narrow and inconvenient was pulled down and a magnificent arch arose in its room at the sole ex∣pence of  Richard  lord  Grosvenour  Beyond this is a vast sub∣urb called the  Foreststreet  whose lower part was defended by a gate demolished as a nusance within these few years  AFTER passing the  Eastgate  the traveller will observe without the walls a vast foss cut through the live rock now a common road to the water but which appears to me to have been a work of the  Romans  as a defence on this side and which con∣tinues the rectangular shape of the station  THE views from the several parts of the walls are extremely elegant  FINEVIEWS  The mountains of  Flintshire  and  Denbighshire  the hills of  Broxton  and the insulated rock of  Beeston  form the ruder part of the scenery a rich flat gives a softer view and the pro∣spect up the river towards  Boughton  recalls in some degree the idea of the  Thames  and  Richmondbill  ON the Conquest as has been before related the king visited this city in person and restored the fortifications It is probable that he only repaired the walls but that he entirely rebuilt the castle  Ordericus Vitalis  on the  Norman  model and en∣larged it far beyond the dimensions of that of the  Saxons  which occupied the summit of the mount or little hill on which the fortress stands That part is artificial in order to give a great elevation as was customary in the  Saxon  keeps and the portion so flung up appears here to have been a mixture of stones and exceedingly hard clay  THE castle is composed of two parts an upper and a lower each with a strong gate  CASTLE  defended by a round bastion on each side with a ditch and formerly with drawbridges Within the precincts of the upper  Ballium  are to be seen some towers of  Norman  architecture square with square projections at each  corner very slightly salient The handsomest is that called  Ju∣lius Caesar  's Its entrance is through a large Gothic door pro∣bably of later workmanship The lowest room has a vaulted roof strengthened with ordinary square couples The upper had been a chapel as appears by the holywater pot and some figures almost obsolete painted on the walls Its dimensions are nineteen feet four inches by sixteen six the height also six∣teen feet six The roof is vaulted but the couples which are rounded slender and elegant run down the walls and rest on the cornuted capitals of five short but beautiful round pillars in the same style with those in the chapterhouse of the cathe∣dral probably the work of the same architect The arsenal some batteries and certain habitable buildings occupy the re∣maining part  ON the sides of the lower court stands the noble room called  Hugh Lupus  's hall  LUPUS'S HALL  in which the courts of justice for the county are held The length is very near ninetynine feet the breadth fortyfive the height very aweful and worthy the stateapartment of a great baron The roof supported by wood∣work in a bold style carved and placed on the sides resting on stout brackets  THIS magnificent building probably retains its original dimen∣sions The character of the first  Norman  earl required a hall suited to the greatness of his hospitality which was confined to no bounds 'He was' says  Ordericus  Lib iv p    not only liberal but prosuse He did not carry a family with him but an army  He kept no account of receits or disbursements He was per∣petually wasting his estates and was much fonder of falconers and huntsmen than of cultivators of the land and holy men and by his gluttony he grew so excessively fat that he could hardly crawl about  ADJOINING to the end of this great hall is the court of ex∣chequer  EXCHEQUER  or the chancery of the county palatine of  Chester  The earl of  Cholmondely  is the present chamberlain Sir  Richard Perrin  my worthy countryman sits and discharges the office of vicechamberlain In respect to matters of equity he here acts as lord chancellor The chamberlain was one of the an∣tient earl's great officers and had a fee of twentytwo pounds a year This very building is said to have been the parlement∣house of the little kings of the palatinate It savors of anti∣quity in the architecture and within are a number of seats described by Gothic arches and neat pillars at the upper end are two one for the earl the other for the abbot The eight others were allotted to his eight barons and occupy one side of the room  UNDER the vicechamberlain is a baron who holds a weekly court in which appearances are entered for bringing causes to a trial Writs and subpoenas are also here made out as well for the great sessions for this county as for those of the county of  Flint  Here is besides an examiner and a sealkeeper who has the charge of the records  THE judges have lodgings within the castle during their circuit by antient custom These are furnished by the sheriffs of the city The sheriffs of the county take care of their horses but  are allowed the expences when they bring in their accounts at the audit  THE county jail for felons and debtors is the last place to be described  JAIL  I can do little more than confirm the account of it by the humane  Howard  Their dayconfinement is in a little yard surrounded on all sides by lofty buildings imper∣vious to the air excepting from above and ever unvisited by the purifying rays of the sun Their nocturnal apartments are in cells seven feet and a half by three and a half ranged on one side of a subterraneous dungeon in each of which are often lodged three or four persons The whole is rendered more wholesomely horrible by being pitched over three or four times in the year The scanty air of their streight prisonyard is to travel through three passages to arrive at them through the window of an adjacent room through a grate in the floor of the said room into the dungeon and finally through the dungeon through a little grate above the door of each of their kennels In such places as these are the innocent and the guilty permitted to be lodged till the law decides their fate I am sure the humane keeper Mr  Thomas  must feel many a pang at the necessary discharge of his duty Mr HOWARD compares the place to the blackhole at  Calcutta  The view I had of it assisted to raise the idea of a much worse prison where  No light but rather darkness visible  Served only to discover sights of woe  The constable of the castle holds his place for life is properly the keeper of the prison but appoints a deputy He is ac∣countable  for all prisoners and debtors and answerable for their escapes  WITHIN the walls of this fortress was an instance of a felon suffering  prison forte et dure  for standing mute on his trial till he died of hunger  PRISON FORTE IT DURE  One  Adam  son of  John  of the  Woodhouses  was in the th of  Edward  II committed for burning his own houses and carrying away the goods He stood mute a jury as usual was empanelled who decided that he could speak if he pleased On this he was committed  ad dietam  and after∣wards  John le Morgan  constable of the castle testified that the aforesaid  Adam  was dead  ad dietam  Harleian  MSS N  o    This was the origin of the punishment of pressing to death or the  peine forte et dure  which seems a sort of merciful hastening of death for it must have been much more horrible as well as tedious in the manner prescribed by the law of the first  Edward  in whose reign it ori∣ginated The words of the statute are  Qe les felouns ecriez et que sont apertement de male fame et ne se voillent mettre en enqueste des felonies qe lem lui mette devant justices a la suite le Roy  soient mys en la prison fort et dure  c  THE term  ad dietam  was ironical expressive of the sad suste∣nance the sufferer was allowed  viz  on the first day three morsels of the worst bread on the second three draughts of water out of the next puddle and this was to be alternately his daily diet till he died  MR RYMER records a strange instance of a woman at  Not∣tingham  who underwent this punishment and lived forty days  without meat or drink This happened in in the reign of  Edward  III who  ad laudem Dei et gloriosae virginis MA∣RLAe matris suae unde dictum miraculum processit  at credi∣tur  The woman's name was  Caecilia  indicted for the murder of her husband  John de Rygeway Rymer  's Foedera vi    granted the sufferer a free pardon After mentioning that it is probable that the miracle was a little assisted by natural means I must observe that according to this instance the con∣demned were in some cases absolutely denied any species of food in others it seems probable from the name of the pu∣nishment of  Adam  that they sometimes were allowed that wretched diet which was continued when the punishment changed into the  peine dure et forte  THERE is a singularity in the manner of the treatment of the prisoners who are released by capital punishment out of their dreadful cells which merits mention They are delivered by the constable or his deputy at a stone called  Glover'sstone  about ninety yards distant from the outward gate into the hands of the sheriffs of the city who receive them at that stone which is the extreme limit of the castle precincts and from thence convey them to the place of execution which they also have the charge of This custom is not accounted for any more than by tradition that a felon was formerly rescued in his way to the gallows by the citizens of  Chester  and perhaps by the connivance of the magistrates who are supposed to have had the disagreeable duty inflicted on them of executing all criminals whether they are of the county or the city  THE city was separated from the castle and made a county of itself by the charter of  Henry  VII the castle was left as an ap∣pertance to the shire and has the small outlet of a little street called  Glover'sstone  GLOVER'S STONE  which is also independent of the city and in which nonfreemen may set up any trade unmolested by the corporation  THE castle has a governor lieutenantgovernor and constable and is garrisoned by two companies of invalids  THE civil government and architecture is next to be taken notice of I have in my account of  Saxon  and  Norman  CHES∣TER given a brief relation of the government of the city in those periods I shall at present only mention the principal charters and flatter myself that the reader will excuse my brevity not only as it is beyond the power of the travelling topographer to collect the same materials as the resident but because his curiosity will it is to be hoped soon be satisfied by the publication of the history of this city by the Reverend Doctor GOWER which will amply supply all my defici∣encies  THE first royal charter which this city was honored with is that of  Henry  III  CHARTERS  who confirms all the priveleges bestowed on them by the  Norman  earls and I imagine first flung the government into the form of a regular corporation for he grants and confirms to them that none shall buy or sell mer∣chandise in the city except citizens unless it be in the fairs under the penalty of ten pounds  EDWARD I gave the city of  Chester  with the appertenances and all the liberties and priveleges to its citizens and their heirs  to be holden of him and his heirs for ever paying annually  l  he also granted them the election of a coroner and pleas of the crown and that they should have sock  Sock he who is invested with this has power to hold courts within his own lands SACK power of deciding complaints and quarrels and applying to his own use the fines resulting from such decisions within his own territory TOLL needs no explanation THEME the right to dispose of all his bonds∣men their children and goods INEANGTHEFE the power of

and dominion of toll passage  c  EDWARD III confirmed the past grants and added another of all the vacant lands within the liberty of the city with leave for the citizens to build on such vacant spots  EDWARD the black prince prescribed by particular names the boundaries of the city beginning at the  Ironbridge  and from thence to  Saltney  the  Portpool Flukersbrook Boughton  c  RICHARD II was particularly kind to his favorite city In consideration of some distresses it had undergone he released them from the payment of seventythree pounds ten shillings and eightpence arrears of rent due to the crown he gave them the profits of the ferry towards the rebuilding and repairing of  Dee  bridge he made them two grants of the murage the first for four years the second for five for the repairs of the walls  But in the d year of his reign  for the furtherance of justice in the same city and better execution thereof he grants unto his subjects majors sheriffs and commonalty of the said city to hold their courts and limited what processes they might award in actions personal felonies appeals processes of utlagary as at common law Granted under the seal of the principality of  Chester  at  Chester May    King ii    This seems to have been found necessary in order to strengthen the civil policy of this place which had four years before been greatly insulted by a dreadful riot in the abby by Sir  Baldwyne  of  Radyngstone  supported by Sir  John  of  Stanley  with eight hundred men A sheriff was killed and many other excesses committed  Harleian  MSS N  o      AFTER the revolution which happened in the mayor and citizens continued to favor the cause of their deposed master and after his death gave all the assistance in their power to  Harry Percy  On his defeat they obtained the royal pardon and in order to conciliate their affections young  Henry  prince of  Wales  and earl of  Chester  confirmed all their former charters and priveleges and afterwards granted to them the profits of murage and bridge tower where tolls were collected  durante bene placito  IN a confirmation of the former charters by  Henry  VI we learn the former concourse of strangers the greatness of the commerce of  Chester  by reason of the goodness of its port and the great trade carried on in provisions into and out of  Wales  It farther recites the melancholy change of affairs the conflux of foreign merchants being put a stop to by the choaking of the creek with sands and the intercourse with  Wales  destroyed since the insurrection of  Owen Glendwr  which considerations moved the king to remit ten pounds of the antient feefarm rent  THE provisions alluded to were probably cheeses on the part of the citizens of  Chester  and perhaps wines spices and other foreign luxuries for which they might receive in exchange from the  Welsh  cattle of different kinds  HENRY VII  MEMBERS  in in consideration of farther distresses of the city not only remitted eighty pounds of its annual rent but granted it a new charter by which he separated it from the county and granted it several of the most valuable prive∣leges which it still enjoys but being a county palatine and in the time of  Edward  I vested in the crown never received summons either for county or city to return members to parlement till the reign of  Henry  VIII when the county in was empowered to send two knights and the city two citizens The electors of the last are the freemen of the city the returningofficers the sheriffs  THE corporation consists of a mayor  CORPORATION  recorder two sheriff s twentyfour aldermen and forty commoncouncil Here are beside two annual officers called  leavelookers  whose business was to prevent all persons who are not free of the city from exer∣cising any trade or exposing to sale any wares or merchandise within the liberties They were accustomed to go round the city in order to preserve these its privileges and sometimes were used  to take small sums called  leavelookerage  for  leave  for nonfree∣men to sell wares by retail but at present the yeoman of the Pentise discharges this office and returns the names of such per∣sons who are found to offend in order that actions might be brought against them We find as early as that similar officers were elected under the name of  custos guild mercator  and who discharged the same function  King ii    THE places where the mayor and other officers of the corpo∣ration assemble for the dispatch of business  PEXTISE  or administration of justice are two the first is the Pentise an antient building in the center of the city near the junction of the four principal streets Mention is made of the northside having been builded in Here all business within the cognizance of a justice of the peace is transacted the aldermen that have past the chair being empowered to act as long as they wear the gown Here also the sheriffs assisted by the recorder sit and determine civil causes  I IMAGINE that this building  PRAETORIUM  St  Peter  's church and a few houses to the north and west occupy the site of the  Roman Prae∣torium  for they not only fill the very situation of that part of the old castrametations but account for the discontinuance of the  Bridge street  which ceases opposite to these edifices This also is the cause why the nearer part of the  Northgate street  is thrown out of its course and falls into the  Eastgate street  many yards beyond the mouth of the  Bridge street  for the lower part of the  Northgate street  where the exchange and shambles stand  points directly towards the former but is interrupted by the space occupied by these buildings The limit of the  Praetorium  on the east was the narrow portion of  Northgate street  on the south part of the present  Bridge Eastgate  and  Watergate streets  on the west  Goss lane  and on the north the space now occupied by the fishmarket The  praetorium  with its attendants de∣manded no small space for besides the spot possessed by the general were the apartments of the  imperatoris contubernales  or the young nobility immediately under his care the  augurale  where prayers sacrifices and other religious rites were performed which might have stood on the site of the modern church and the general might have had his tribunal on the very spot where the worshipful corporation at present sit for the redress of grievances  THE courts of justice are held in the common hall  EXCHANGE  a large and commodious room over the exchange adorned with the portraits of several popular persons among them is a fulllength of Sir  William Williams  recorder of this city speaker of the house of commons in the reign of  Charles  II and solicitorgeneral in that of his successor In this place are held a crownmote court portmote court and court of sessions The mayor assisted by the recorder is judge of the crownmote court He has jurisdiction in all criminal causes treason only excepted He is also judge of the portmote court with the same assistant This court holds plea in all actions real personal and mixed In the court of sessions the aldermen above the chair try pettylarcenies and determine upon inferior offences In this place the body corporate hold their assemblies for making byelaws  for the government of the city for managing the public build∣ings and directing the charities and finally the city elec∣tions of magistrates as well as members are made in this court  THE only remains of any  hotel  and that of no antient date stood in  Old Commonball lane  which when entire surrounded a square and communicated with  Watergate street  It was founded by Sir  Thomas Egerton  chamberlain of  Chester  afterwards lord chan∣cellor of  England  and designed by him for a dwellinghouse The small remainder which faced the lane and was occupied by a poor family on the th of  November  was the scene of a dreadful calamity The first floor was engaged by a puppetshow man and at the moment he was exhibiting to a very full audience by some unknown accident pounds weight of gunpowder which was lodged in a warehouse beneath took fire and blew up three stories Twentythree people pe∣rished and eightythree were much burnt bruised and received broken and dislocated limbs of which number only three died and those with locked jaws The remedy found most efficacious for the burnt was  Goulard  's extract of lead  THE external effects of this explosion were these the win∣dows and broken glass of several of the neighboring houses fell outwards from which it appears that they were not broken by the shock of the gunpowder but by the pressure of the air within the apartments which rushed out into the  vacuum  oc∣casioned by the explosion A similar phaenomenon has been remarked from an explosion from the inflammable vapor of a mine when the neighboring trees fell towards the blast Howso∣ever  where the force of the powder was confined by narrow passages its centrifugal effect took place for two boys walk∣ing along the rows in  Watergate street  opposite to a passage leading to the building were blown one against the rails the other into the street and the roof of a house was blown off op∣posite a passage into  Commonhall lane  IT is much to be wished that the easy magistracy of this city would from this dire accident take into consideration the safety of the whole in preference to the conveniency of a few lazy individuals and either compel them to keep by them only the legal quantity or at their session appoint proper places for lodging gunpowder This is the second tremendous warning of the same nature which the city hath been visited with On the first of  April  the shop of Mr  Thomas Murray  in  Bridge street  and the house were blown up and himself and a young gentleman killed Notwithstanding this double admoni∣tion I fear its attention still continues lethargic  THE surviving sufferers of this calamity were relieved    l  was also immediately collected from the humane inhabitants of the city to be distributed among these miserable maimed objects  in the wellregulated infirmary established here and supported by the voluntary contributions from the city county and neigh∣boring parts of  Wales  It is a handsome building in an airy situation and detached from the streets This charity was founded in and originated from a bequest of  l  left by Dr  Stratford  commissary of  Richmond  towards the com∣mencing of a public hospital in this city Subscriptions were  circulated and a sum equal to the design soon raised Before the present building could be ready for the reception of patients a temporary infirmary was prepared for them in in  North∣gate street  The new infirmary was opened on the th of  March  and has been supported with a spirit that does honor to the environs which has enabled the managers to receive since its institution not fewer than thirteen thousand six hun∣dred and thirtysix objects of relief The portrait of the founder is placed in the councilroom of the infirmary a threequarters piece sitting in a long wig and civilian's gown  I SHALL now take a short view of the ecclesiastical state of this antient city It is necessary first to observe that the  Mercian  kingdom was divided into five bishopricks  Lichfield Chester Worcester Lydnecester  and  Dorchester  which last was afterwards removed to  Lincoln Lichfield  was made about the year metropolitan by order of  Offa  and afterwards for a long space incorporated into itself its suffragan  Chester  How greatly the last flourished is evident from an account of its annual payment to the pope in very early times for when  Lichfield  payed only three thousand florins our see advanced five thousand No wonder that its jealousy should be excited Very little is known of the state of this church in the  Saxon  period Let it suffice to say that a bishop of  Lichfield  of the name of  Peter  in the year removed his episcopal seat to  Chester  and during his life made use of the church of St  John  's for his cathedral This translation was of very short date for his successor established himself in the former diocese and  Chester  continued without a bishop till the dissolution of monasteries when in  Henry  VIII restored it to its former honor by creating it one of the six  Westminster Oxford Bristol Gloster Peterborough  and  Chester  The first was suppressed in the reign of queen  Mary  new sees formed on that great event and converted the church of the late abby of St  Werburgh  into the ca∣thedral  THE first of the new bishops was  John Bird  a  Carmelite  and provincial of the order a man subservient to the court who by preaching against the pope's supremacy so recom∣mended himself to the king as to obtain the bishoprick of  Bangor  from whence he was removed to  Chester  as a fit per∣son to suit the rapacity of the times In he granted away the whole of the manors and demesnes of the see and accepting impropriation instead of them left his successors not a single acre excepting that on which the palace stands and the court before it another house adjacent a little orchard called the  Woodyard  two houses near St  John  's church and a few small tenements in the city of  York  Notwithstanding the sum he amassed he was found at the accession of  Mary  in debt to the crown  l    s  for tenths and subsidies a vast sum for the times His interest with bishop  Bonner  still would have saved him had he not committed in those days the heinous crime of matrimony for which he was deprived in  HE left his diocese one of the lest in value yet greatest in extent of any in  England  for it reaches from  Hawarden  in  Flintshire  to the river  Derwent  in  Cumberland  comprehending the entire counties of  Cheshire  and  Lancashire  part of  Westmore∣land  Cumberland  and  Richmondshire  in  Yorkshire  the chapelties of  Holt  and  Iscoed  the churches of  Hawarden Hanmer Ban∣gor Worthenhury  and the chapelry of  Orton Maddoc  in the ad∣jacent parts or  Wales  THE abby  ABBY  out of which this see was formed was of great antiquity History relates that it had been originally a nunnery founded about the year by  Wulpherus  king of the  Mer∣cians  in favor of his daughter's indisposition to a married life This was the celebrated St  Werburgh  who took the veil after living immaculate for three years with her husband  Ceolredus  after the example of her aunt the great  Ethelreda  who coha∣bited for three years with no less purity with her first spouse  Tonberctus  and for twelve with her second the pious prince  Eg∣frid  St  Werburgh  presided over several  Mercian  monasteries died at  Tricengham  and by her own order was interred at  Heanburge  but on the approach of the  Danes  in her body was con∣veyed to  Chester  as a place of security from the insults of those pagans  Hiden  in  Gale iii    IT is uncertain how long this community existed It probably was ruined by the ravages of the barbarians in and finally suppressed for we are told  Ibid  that from the reign of king  Athelstan  in to the coming of the  Normans  a set of canons secular were established in the place of the nuns This pious deed was that of  Ethelsleda  who restored the buildings which afterwards were repaired by earl  Leofric  husband to the famous  Go∣diva  The house was richly endowed by the kings  Edmund  and  Edgar  and by  Leofric Edgar  's charter begins in a strain equally pious and sublime  Dugdale  Monast i    ON the accession of  Hugh Lupus  to this earldom he suppressed the canons secular and established in their place a colony of his countrymen  Benedictines  from  Bec  in  Normandy  for pro∣bably he did not care to trust his salvation to the prayers of the  Saxon  religious It is said that this piece of piety was owing to a fit of illness which the earl was seized with when he took the usual way in those days of soothing a troubled conscience  Anselm  abbot of  Bec  and afterwards archbishop of  Canterbury  regulated the new foundation and appointed his chaplain  Richard  to be the first abbot  Lupus  and his successors were very liberal in their endowments  Idem  c  and the place flou∣rished till its dissolution which was effected by the surrender of the last abbot  Thomas Clerk  who received in reward the of∣fice of the new deanry which he enjoyed only six weeks The revenues of this great abby were according to  Dugdale    l    s  II  d  to Speed  l    s    d  ACCORDING to a survey of this abby preserved in the  Harleian  collection its extent was very considerable surrounding the present square and covering several parts of the adjacent ground The old abbycourt is adorned on two sides by very handsome modern houses built between the years and on leases granted by the dean and chapter Another side is filled by the new palace an elegant pile which rose under the auspices of that munificent and hospitable prelate  Edmund  Keen  present bishop of  Ely  Its place was before occupied by the house of the antient abbots  THE old gate is yet standing is a plain but noble entrance and consists towards the street of two Gothic arches included within a round one of great diameter and which appears  to  have been of far older date One side was the porter's lodge on the other a place called St  Thomas  's court A chapel dedicated to the same saint stood where the present deanry is and from its antient appearance seems to have been externally the same building  THE cloisters are entire but consist only of three walks the court extending on one side quite to the church By the dif∣ferent arms on the roof it appears to have been repaired at several times from the time of  Edward  III to that of  W  sey  whose arms with those of the see of  York  with the cardinal's cap are also to be seen here  ON one side stood the fratry  SCHOOL  a vast room which is used as a freeschool founded by  Henry  VIII in the th year of his reign for twentyfour boys who are appointed by the dean and chapter they may continue there four years if their conduct be regular but the dean has power to grant a year of grace No boy unless he be a choirister ought to be chosen before he is nine years old or after he is fifteen Two masters are appointed for their instruction a chief and an under master elected by the dean and chapter  IN a corner of the eastside of the cloister is a passage and stairs to the dormitory and the antient priests cellars and kitchen On the same side is a passage formerly called the Maidens aile  which leads to the little abbycourt a part of the antient build∣ing belonging to the prebends  THE beautiful edifice  CHAPTERHOUSE  the chapterhouse stands in the same walk of the cloister The vestibule is arched supported by four columns each surrounded with eight slender pilasters with∣out capitals which converge near the top of the column and spread over the roof The dimensions of this room are thirtythree feet four inches by twentyseven four the height twelve feet nine On the sides is a stonefeat for the attendants on the business of the chapter  THE chapterhouse is fifty feet long twentysix feet broad end thirtyfive feet high at the upper end is a window con∣sisting of five lancetshaped divisions and on each side is ano∣ther of three At the height of eight feet and a half from the floor a narrow gallery runs along three parts of the room divided from the windows by a triplet of most elegant lofty slender pillars The roof is of stone the springs of the arches which secure it are supported by neat pilasters with palmy capitals  THE modern bookcases deform the lower parts of the room as high as the bottoms of the windows The walls conjecture had been ornamented with pilasters and had a stoneseat like that of the vestibule The entrance both from the cloisters and between the vestibule and the chapterhouse are Gothic but apparently of a later species of architecture than either of those rooms  THE chapterhouse was built in all probability in the time of  Rendle the first  earl of  Chesler  who died in after en∣joying  his earldom eight years The great earl  Hugh Lupus  uncle to  Randle  had been interred in the churchyard of the abby the first care of the nephew was to remove the body into this building  Leicester's Hist  Antiq  as the most honorable place a respect which would certainly have been payed to it had this edifice existed at the time of his death Here his remains continued unmolested till the year when in digging within the chapterhouse they were found in a stone coffin wrapped in leather with a cross on the breast and at the head of the coffin a stone in shape of a T with the wolf's head the allusion to his name engraven on it Other coffins were discovered beneath the two rooms of earls their countesses or of abbots but the great leveller death had reduced them to dust indistinguishable  THE earls who were interred here were  Hugh  who died in  Randle the first  or  de Meschina  in  Randle the second  or  de Gernouns  who was poisoned in by  William Peverel Hugh Cyvelioc  who died at  Leek  in  Randle the third  or  de Blundeville  who died at  Wallingford  in where his bowels were interred his heart was buried at the abby of  Dieulacres  in  Staffordshire  and his body transported to  Chester  finally  John Scot  who in underwent the same fate as  Randle the second  So that every earl of the  Norman  line were deposited here excepting  Richard  who perished by shipwreck in  The particulars of the deaths of this illustriou line may be seen is LEICESTER or in DUGDALE'S  Baronage  i c    OF the abbots  Geofry  who died in and six others were buried in the chapterhouse or its vestibule  Willis  's Cathedrals i    THE church bounds the north side of the cloisters The lower part of the wall has a row of arches now filled up and savors more of antiquity than any other part This and a portion of the northtransepts are the oldest parts of the present building but there is no part left at present that can boast of a remote date All the labors of the  Saxons  and almost all of those of its refounder  Hugh Lupus  are now lost The abbot  Simon Ripley  who was elected in finished the middle aile and the tower The body is supported by six sharppointed arches The co∣lumns are thick surrounded by pilasters with small rounded capitals Above is a gallery with a neat stone balustrade in the parts where it is entire and a row of large and broad pointed windows which is the general style  THE present cathedral appears to have been built excepting the slight fragments just mentioned in the reigns of  Henry  VI VII and VIII but principally in that of the two last The beau∣tiful westend was begun in and the first stone laid with much ceremony The window over the door is filled with beau∣tiful tracery and the doorcase enriched with figures and other sculpture The descent into the church is down a multitude of steps so there is reason to suspect that the present was on the foundation of the antient church which had been on a level with the old streets which we know are many feet higher than they were originally by the accession of rubbish and other adventitious matter  THE center beneath the great tower is greatly injured by a modern bellloft which conceals a crownwork of stone that would have a good effect was the loft destroyed  FROM the springs of arches that appear in the walls of the n  e and its ailes it appears as if the architect had intended to have vaulted them in the manner in which St  Mary  's chapel and the choiral ailes are done  THE choir is very neat and the Gothic tabernaclework over the stalls carved in a light and elegant manner The arches in the galleries are divided by pretty slender pillars and perhaps were of a date prior to the body of the church probably the work of abbot  Oldham  who was a benefactor and had a con∣cern in the building  IN the chancel are four stonestalls for the officiating priests with carved Gothic work above a recess or two for the pre∣serving either the reliques or the sacred utensils About the walls are dispersed the monuments of several bishops and church∣men but none of any magnificence and one of Sir  William Manwaring  a gallant young man who sell in the defence of the city during its long siege  THE bishop's throne stands on a stone base as remarkable for its sculpture as its original use Its form is an oblong square and each side most richly ornamented with Gothic carving arches and pinnacles Around the upper part is a range of little images designed to represent the kings and saints of the  Mercian  kingdom Each held in one hand a scroll with the name inscribed Fanatic ignorance mutilated many of the la∣bels as well as the figures but the last were restored about  the year but the workman by an unlucky mistake has placed female heads on male shoulders and given manly faces to the bodies of the fairsex At first there were thirtyfour figures four are lost the remainder are faithfully described and the history of each monarch and saint accurately given in a little pamphlet published in by the worthy Doctor  William Cooper  who dedicated the profits for the use of the blue∣coat hospital in this city I beg leave to dissent from the notion of this having been the shrine of St  Werbugh  ST WERBURCH'S SHRINE  as it is po∣pularly called It certainly was nothing more than the pedestal on which the real shrine or as the  French  call it  la chasse  stood which contained the sacred reliques These are made of gold silver vermeil  i e  silver gilt or some precious materials and often enriched with gems of great value They are of different forms such as churches cabinets  c  and should the relique be a head or limb the  chasse  is made conformable to the shape of the part These are seated usually conspicuous on an ele∣vated place and are always moveable in order that they may be carried in procession either in honor of the saint or to divert some great calamity Thus in the shrine of St  Werburgh  was brought out to stop the rage of a fire in the city which for a long time was invincible by every other means but the approach of the holy remains instantly proved their sanctity by putting an end to its furious desolation  BEFORE I take leave of this part of the church  ASSASSINATION  I must men∣tion an impious outrage committed at the high altar in by a gentleman of  Wales  who wounded almost to death one  Patrick Filling  I suppose the officiating priest The church as  usual was immediately suspended till a lustration in order to purify it from the foul stain was performed The abby was reconciled on St  Werburgh  's day the parishchurch on that of St  Oswald  King ii    AN impiety of this kind was committed in the church of  Notre Dame  at  Paris  in  Felibica Hist Paris ii Pieces Justif iii  The priest died of his wound and expiation was made by order of the archbishop public prayers were offered up for forty hours in all the churches processions made a fast of three days appointed The whole terminated by a general  reparation  satisfaction of the injury by a grand pro∣cession in which the whole parlement assisted The streets were covered with tapestry and the avenues barred up with the chains to keep off the mob and thus the place was restored to the discharge of the sacred offices  IT is with a kind of horror I read in the zealous  Fox  of an outrage of this sort committed in our own kingdom in the reign of queen  Mary  Martyrs iii  The enthusiast was taken and punished by the striking off the criminal hand and by being burnt yet the historian gives him a place among the more wellmeaning sufferers of that barbarous period  BEHIND the choir is St  Mary  's chapel and on each side is an aile The monuments in these parts are in no wise remark∣able In its northaile is a tomb with a flowery cross that of an abbot and another of an altarform ascribed to  Henry  IV em∣peror of  Germany  who according to a legendary tale was  said to have escaped from his troubles and to have resided in  Godstall lane  in this city to have died there and to have been interred in the abby It is very uncertain whether this great but cal  mitous prince was ever in our kingdom but it is very certain be finished his days at  Liege  Modern Univ Hist xxxix  in and was mag∣nificently interred in the cathedral of that city  The transepts are of unequal lengths The north is very large dedicated to St  Oswald  and is the parishchurch of that name This is said to have stood on the first church of St  Peter  and St  Paul  which was afterwards changed to that of the  Holy Trinity  and finally to the name it now bears On the re∣building of the church this aile was designedly enlarged and allotted by the monks to the neighboring inhabitants who were for the most part their servants or tenants At first the reli∣gious wished to have the whole to themselves and on that ac∣count built at a distance from this aile a chapel called St  Nicholas  's and endowed it with a vicarage for the use of the laity but afterwards at the request of the inhabitants and by composition between the mayor and abbot about the year they were restored to the use of the church of St  Oswald  which they still retain  King  ii    THE chapel falling into disuse was purchased by the citizens and converted into their commonhall for dispatch of business  It is probable that there had been a more antient commonhall a lane in this city still retains the name of  Old Commonhall lane  In later times since the building of the exchange it has been  converted into a magazine for wool into a carrier's warehouse and part into a theatre acting under parlementary license  THIS abby afforded only a temporary sanctuary to the prosh∣gate The privelege which  Hugh Lupus  granted is particular he ordered that no thief or other malefactor that attended the fair held at the feast of St  Werburgh  should be attached unless he committed some new offence there  Leicester    This says  King  drew a vast concourse of loose people together at that season and proved of singular advantage to  Randle the third  earl of  Chester  who in being surrounded in the castle of  Rudland  by a nu∣merous army of  Welsh  and in great danger sent for relief to his general  Roger Lacy  at that time attending the midsummerfair  Lacy  instantly collected a body of minstrels fiddlers and idle people who were assembled here on account of this privelege marched with them into  Wales  and relieved the earl from his distress  Randle  on his return immediately rewarded  Lacy  with a full power over all the instruments of his preservation  me∣gisterium omnium lecatorum et meretricam totius  CESTRESHIRE By this grant he was empowered to require the attendance of all the minstrels and musicians of the county on the anniversary of the exploit They were to play before him and his heirs for ever in a procession to the church of St  John  and after divine service to the place where he kept his court The minstrels were there examined concerning their lives and conversation whether any of them played without annual licence from their lord or whether they had heard any words among their fellows  tending to his dishonor These priveleges were afterwards devolved by  John  son of  Roger de Lacy  to  Hugh de Dutton  and his heirs The procession and courts were held by their steward within my memory but the custom is now dropt I find also that  Dutton  and his heirs clamed at the feast from the minstrels  quatuor lagenas vini et unam lancem  four bottles of wine and one lance and at the same time a fee of four pence halfpenny and from every  Meretrix  in  Cheshire  and in the city of  Chester officium suum exercente  four pence  Leicester      THE other religious houses in this city were  CARMELITES  the  Carmelites  or  White friers  who had a convent in that part of St  Martin  's parish still called  Whitefriers lane  part of Mr  Marsden  's house is formed of the remains The church as appears by  Braun  's view of this city in stood a little west of it  BY the charter of  Roger Lacy  to the abby of  Norton  it ap∣pears that there was a monastery in the parish of St  Michael  Dugdale Monast  ii  which he grants to the canons of the former We are left igno∣rant of the order it was of  IN  Trinity  parish stood a house of  Franciscan  or  Grey friers  which bishop  Tanner  conjectures might have been as antient as the time of  Henry  III The site was granted to one  John Cokke  I imagine that this stood in the  Yatch field  near the place occu∣pied by the new linnenhall By  Speed  's plan of  Chester  it ap∣pears that there was a church there in his time and to this day painted tiles and painted glass reliques of ecclesiastical sinery are still dug up  IN the parish of St  Martin  's  Rather is that of  Trinity    s  ½  d  is paid at the audit for the site of it  was a monastery of preach∣ing or  Black friers  said by  Speed  to have been founded by a bishop of  Chester  meaning as  Tanner  observes of  Lichfield  This as well as the other religious house in this parish was granted to the same  John Cokke  Part of this house and its fine vaults are occupied by  Hanry Hesketh  esquire  ST JOHN'S  ST JOHN'S  which lies without the walls on the eastside of the city was once a collegiate church reputed to have been founded by king  Ethelred  in on being admonished by a vision to build it on the spot where he should find a white hind After the ruin of the city by the  Danes  the church was restored by his namesake earl of  Mercia  in and was in the next century repaired and endowed by earl  Leofric  A monastery was also founded here for historians record that king  Edgar  was rowed from his palace to the monastery of St  John  The Doomsday book also mentions the monastery of St  Mary  near the same church This besides was the cathedral during the short time the see was removed from  Lichfield  by bishop  Peter  In an old plan of it appears a house called the bi∣shop's  AT the dissolution here was found a dean and seven pre∣bendaries or canons in the collation of the bishop of  Lichfield  seven vicars two clerks four choiristers sextons and other servants most of whose houses are distinguished in the same plan Their yearly revenue after reprisals was only  l    s    d  The site of the college and some part  of the buildings were granted by queen  Elizabeth  to  John Fortescue  Tanner      ON the eastside of the churchyard stood the chapel of St  Anne  belonging to the brethren and sisters of the fraternity of St  Anne  Harleian  MSS N  o    This in later days was called  Cholmondly  hall but is now totally demolished  ST JOHN'S when entire was a magnificent pile The tower once stood in the center but falling down in was never rebuilt The chancel was probably demolished at the same time but at that end are some fine arches and other remains of antient chapels Withinside are curious specimens of the clumsy strength of  Saxon  architecture in the massy columns and round arches which support the body The tower is now placed at the westend and has on one side the legend repre∣sented by the figure of a man and a hind  ON the southside of the churchyard impending over a high cliff supposed to be the  Radeclive  of the Doomsday book is a small antient building probably a chapel called the  Anchori∣tage  placed over the retreat of some holy hermits This might have been their place of sepulture for in the live rock were found two bodies deposited in coffinshaped cavities This might have been the place where legend says that  Harold  the last  Saxon  king ended his days for it was long believed by the  English  that he escaped from the battle of  Hastings  and finished his life in retirement  DOCTOR TANNER supposes that the convent of  Benedictine  nuns dedicated to St  Mary  originated either from the mo∣nastery  of St  John  or was a relique of one of the old nunneries be∣longing to St  Werburgh  This perhaps may have been the case for from a charter preserved by  Dugdale  it appears that  Ranale the second  earl of  Chester  had obtained  for the nuns of  Chester certain crofts from  Hugh Fitzoliver  for them to build a church and convent on which implies that there had been nuns in the city previous to his grant  Sciatis me dedisse et in perpetuam elemosynam concepisse D  o et sanctae  Mariae  et MONIALIBUS  Cestriae  c  Monasticon  i  I find also that  Edward  the black prince had been a benefactor for there is mention of a charter of his to the nuns granted in the d of his father's reign  Herleian  MSS N  o    This was suppressed with the other religious houses in At that time  Elizabeth Grosvenour  was prioress who made a surrender of the house and had a pension for life of twenty pounds and eleven of the sisters had also pensions from  l  to  l    s    d  each The site was granted in the d of  Henry  VIII to the  Urian Breretons  senior and junior The revenues were according to  Dugdale    l    s    d  to  Speed    l    s    d  I have a groundplot of this nunnery by which it appears to have been a compact but small building The church was twentytwo yards long and fifteen broad and supported in the middle by a row of pillars The chapel was nine yards by four threequarters the cloisters thirty yards by twentyone It stood in the nurserygarden on the westside of the city still called the  Nun's garden  where vestiges of the walls and arches are yet remaining  WITHOUT the  Northgate  stood a hospital dedicated to St  John the Baptist  and formerly a sanctuary and endowed with great priveleges The mastership was granted by  Edward  II to the prior of  Berkinhead  and his successors but afterwards disposed of by the crown to secular clergy The house at the dissolution consisted of a chaplain and six poor brethren whose income after reprisals was  l    s    d  Tanner    Mention is made by bishop  Tanner    of the liberties of the hospital of St  Giles  being confirmed by  Edward  III I am told that a fragment supposed to be part of this charity is to be seen in the  Forest street  THE last antient hospital was instituted for lepers in the suburbs of  Boughton  about the beginning of  Edward  II's reign I think opposite to the place of excution the buryingground is still made use of by the parish of St  Oswald  THE number of parishes are nine None of the churches are remarkable excepting those of St  Peter  's and  Trinity  which are distinguished by their handsome spires The first was finished in when the parson and others signalized themselves by eating part of a goose on it and flinging the rest into the four streets  King  i    THE number of inhabitants including the suburbs of  Bough∣ton  and  Hanbridge  are estimated to be fourteen thousand seven hundred and thirteen The houses are almost entirely situated in a dry sandstone rock Whether it be owing to that the clearness of the air and the purity of the water it is certain  that the proportion of death among the inhabitants is only as one to thirtyone whereas I am informed by my worthy friend Doctor  Haggarth  of this city that in  Leeds  one in twentyone in  Northampton  and  Shrewsbury  one in twentysix and in  London  one in twenty and threefourths annually pay the great tribute of nature  I DO not recollect any thing remarkable on the outside of the walls which has been unnoticed unless it be the  Roodeye  and the adjacent places The  Dee  after quitting the contracted pass at the bridge flows beneath an incurvated clayey cliff and washes on the right a fine and extensive meadow long since protected against its ravages by a lofty dike I imagine that it lay open to the tides till about the year when the corporation to whom it belongs demised to one  Thomas Lyneal  servant to Sir  Francis Walsingham  this pasture for the term of twentyone years together with as much land as he could gain to it from the sea He was also to make at his own costs a quay for boats and barks to unload at full sea near the watergate for which he was at first to have two pence for every vessel pass∣ing by with any lading but after that the sum was encreased to four pence and  Lyneal  was to pay an annual rent of  l  to the city At first he met with some obstructions Sir  Francis  therefore interfered in order that his servant might proceed without further interruption  Harleian  MSS N  o      THE name of this spot is taken from  eye  its watery situation and  rood  the cross which stood there whose base is still to be  seen On this place the lusty youth in former days exercised themselves in manly sports of the age in archery running leaping and wrestling in mockfights and gallant and romantic triumphs From the hints dropt by  Daniel King  I imagine them to have been of the same nature with those practised by the young men of the metropolis described by  FitzStephen  a writer cotemporary with  Henry  II  The lay sons of the citizens rush out of the gates in shoals furnished with lances and shields the younger sort with javelins pointed but disarmed of their steel they ape the feats of war and act the shamfight Part took the field well mounted The generous coursers neigh and champ the bit At length when the course begins and the youthful combatants are divided into classes or parties one body retreats and another pursues without being able to overtake them while in another quarter the pursuers overtake the foe unhorse them and pass them many a length The elders of the city and the fathers of the parties and the rich and the wealthy come into the field on horseback to behold the exercises  Vide  FitzStephen  's Deser  Lend  translated by an Antiquary  One would imagine by what follows the antient historian was describing the sports of  Ascanius  and his youthful train on the plains of  Sicily  Postquam omnem laeti consessum oculosque suoram  Lustravere in equis c  Now round the ring before their fathers ride  The boys in all their military pride  Till the loud lash resounding from afar  Gave the glad signal of the mimic war  Strait in three bands distinct they break away  Divide in order and their ranks display  Swift at the summons they return and throw  At once their hostile lances at the foe  Then take a new excursion on the plain  Round within round an endless course maintain  And now advance and now retreat again  With welldissembled rage their rivals dare  And please the crowd with images of war  Alternate now they turn their backs in flight  Now dart their lances and renew the fight  Then in a moment from the combat cease  Rejoin their scatter'd bands and move in peace  PITT  A STANDARD was the prize of emulation in the sports cele∣brated on the  Roodeye  Which was won in by sheriff  Montford  on  ShroveTuesday  but in the year the amusements took a new form and under the reign of the peaceful  James  the youthful cavaliers layed aside their mimic war and began that species of horsemanship which the romantic philosopher lord  Herbert  thought unworthy of a man of honor "for" says he 'the exercise I do not approve is the running of horses there 'being much cheating in that kind  THE first prizes we hear of after the suppression of the tri∣umph were a bell and bowl to be run for on St  George  's day which were provided in by Mr  Robert Amery  formerly sheriff of the city and were brought down to the  Roodeye  with great solemnity This seems to have been the origin of the plate given by the city and annually run for on the same day  to the present time A bell was a common prize a little golden bell was the reward of victory in at the races near  York  whence came the proverb for success of any kind  to bear the bell  AT one end of the  Roodeye  stands the  House of Industry  POORHOUSE  a large and useful building founded in by money raised by the city on lifeannuities for several improvements within its li∣berties Here the poor are provided for in a fit manner and to the great ease of the parishes who are relieved from the bur∣den of a numerous poor who were too idle to work and too proud to enter into this comfortable  Asylum  Those of the parish of  Hawarden  are also sent here by virtue of an agree∣ment made between the governors of this charity and the over∣seers of the poor of that parish The inmates contribute by some coarse linen manufactures towards their support  A LITTLE beyond this building are the quays  QUAYS  cranes ware∣houses and other requisites for carrying on the naval trade of this city These are opposite to the  Watergate  and have been much improved of late years and the intervening space has not long since been filled with a neat street Ships of tons burden  can  now reach the quays where the springtides rise at a medium fifteen feet the neaptides eight In the year this port was in so deplorable a state and so choaked with sands that a vessel of twenty tons could not arrive here but the ships were obliged to lie under  Neston  ten miles distant which gave rise to the assemblage of houses called  Parkgate  built on the shore beneath that town A quay called the  New quay  now in ruins was erected near this place in the begin∣ning  Harleaan  MSS N  o    of the last century for the conveniency of loading and unloading the vessels trading with  Chester  and the goods were carried to and from the city by land The misfortune of the port of  Chester  at length gave rise to the prosperity of  Le∣verpool  about this time a very inconsiderable place It now began to discover its own advantages of situation and quickly emerged from its despicable state to its present flourishing con∣dition  IN  New Cut  some friend to the former prevaled on Mr  Andrew Yarranton  a gentleman extremely conversant in the commercial advantages of this island to make a survey of the river  Dee  and its estuary He drew a plan formed the project of a new chan∣nel a scheme for recovering from the sea a large tract of land and restoring the antient navigation even to the present quays and this he got to be presented to the duke of  York  the patron at that time of all useful undertakings He also suggested the idea of a canal from the collieries at  Aston  near  Hawarden  which was to drop into this new channel and facilitate the carriage of coal up to the city  Mr  Andrew Yarranton's England  's Improvements by sea and land c to  London  His plan for that of the  Dee  is at p  Future times had the advantage of his inventive genius Both plans were brought into execution with∣out any great deviation from Mr  Yarranton  's project His new cut was to end opposite to  Flint  the present opens opposite to  Wepra  on this side of  Flint  Sir  John Glynne  's little canal approaches the  Dee  about two miles below the city  Mr  Yarranton  's coal canal was to fall into the  Dee  near to  Flint  AN act of parlement was obtained for the recovering and preserving the navigation of the river for settling the duties on ships and for the establishing two ferries for the conve∣niency of travellers into the county of  Flint  Other acts were passed in the years and the works were begun with vigor The project was carried on by subscription and the adventurers were to be rewarded by the lands they were empowered to gain on both sides from  the  white sands  or the sea from  Chester  and between the county of  Cheshire  on the northside and the county of  Flint  on the fouthside being sands soil and ground not bearing grass  Party contests at first filled the subscriptions zeal for the house of  Hanover  was at that time mixed in this city with zeal for its commercial interest but in a little time it was discovered to be the  madness of many but the gain of few  The expences proved enormous multitudes were obliged to sell out at above ninety  per cent  loss and their shares being bought by persons of more wealth and foresight at length the plan was brought to a considerable degree of utility and a sine canal formed guarded by vast banks in which the river is consined for the space of ten miles along which ships of three hundred and fifty tons burden may safely be brought up to the quays Much land has been gained from the sea and good farms now appear in places not long since possessed by the unruly element  I REMEMBER an almost useless tide flowing about the watertower  the antient channel of the  Dee  flowing under  Blacon  point and the access to the county of  Flint  on this side open only at the recess of tides and annually occasioning the loss of multitudes of lives Two ferries are established at fit places The lower is the proper passage for travellers by  Holyhead  into the kingdom of  Ireland  and calls aloud for the aid of a turn∣pike to render it at all times pervious or the road may be con∣tinued to  Saltney  along the flat so as to fall into the other turn∣pike on the marsh  I SHALL now take a short view of the trade of this city  TRADE  as it stood in the years and I bring the last into sight in order to shew how far this port has been affected by the commotions of our  American  subjects and oppose it to the commerce of when it appears to have been in its meri∣dian since the restoration of the channel In that year were entered inwards  coastingvessels of which were laden with groceries and other goods from  London  coast ships outwards of these came from the port of  London  and were laden here with lead iron cannon two thousand tons of cheese and other goods  IN the same year vessels were entered inwards from foreign parts and entered inwards from  Ireland Portugal Spain Italy  and  America  FROM  Norway  and the  Baltic  are imported timber flax tal∣low hemp iron and deals  FROM  Leghorn  large quantities of kid and lamb skins which are manufactured by the glovers after being dressed here  This in fact is the only manufacture which the city can boast of I find that in the reigns of queen  Elizabeth James  I and the be∣ginning of that of  Charles  I here was a vast trade in calves skins In the first of those monopolizing times the queen grants one  Arthur Balsano  a licence to export dickers of leather of calves skins ten dozens to every dicker for seven years paying five shillings  per  dicker  James  I granted to  James Maxwel  Esq  a licence to export dickers for the same duty and for twentyone years and this was afterwards confirmed to him by  Charles  I  Harleian  MSS N  o    This  Maxwel  was one of the grooms of the bed∣chamber to his majesty and in the preceding reign by a piece of insolence to a gentleman of the inns of court brought on him the resentment of the  English  and was obliged to atone for it by making due submission The first grant might be made to him by  James  to make amends for the mortifications he had un∣dergone  FROM  Spain  and  Portugal  are imported great quantities of cork fruit oil of olives nuts  Barilla  ashes and raisins and several hundred tons of wine from  Portugal  which last form the greatest foreign import of this city  WHILE the trade with  America  was open fish and oil were brought from  Newfoundland  and a small trade was carried on with  Caroling  THE exports this year were upwards of chaldrons of coal from the  Cheshire  and  Flintshire  collieries which lie within this port tons of lead of lead ore of oak  bark all these to foreign parts Besides tons of lead and of lead ore sent coastways that is to the ports of  London  and  Leverpool vae nimium vicina  for the purpose of reex∣portation  IN coastingvessels were entered inwards and outwards  ships entered inwards from foreign parts including those trading between  Dublin  and  Parkgate  and outwards The following table will shew the division of the commerce     Inwards  Outwards  America      France       Flanders       Holland       Ireland      Isle of Man      Portugal      Spain       Italy      Norway Russia  and  Prussia      chaldrons of coal tons of lead and of lead ore were sent abroad but so exhausted are our oaktrees that only tons of bark were shipped tons of lead and of lead ore were sent coastways  FROM the table of entries it appears that the great trade of this city is with  Ireland  which receives annnally from hence  a magazine large quantities of hops woollen cloths worsted stuffs hosiery fustians  Manchester  goods cheese wroughtiron iron great guns hardware bound and unbound books carpets flintglass wrought silks and great quantities of foreign goods sent from  London  by land and shipped from this port  IN return it imports from  Ireland  at the  Midsummer  and  Michaelmas  fairs upwards of boxes and packs of linen cloth containing pieces at lest besides boxes or packs imported into  Leverpool  and sent across the  Mersey  to  Ince  from whence they are conveyed in carts to  Chester  These form all together a million of yards each fair This trade began no longer ago than the year in which yards were imported The importations continually increased till the last year of the late war from which period it has been on a par  IRELAND also sends considerable quantities of lambskins wool linen and bayyarn tallow hides butter feathers and quills ox bones and hoofs glue sheep and cat guts calvevelves pro∣visions and live cattle  THE number of ships belonging to this port shew the uncom∣mercial genius of its inhabitants there being only twentytwo in the foreign trade containing in all tons and men and in the coasttrade whose tonnage is tons and num∣ber of men yet the port extends on the  Cheshire  side of the estuary as far as the end of  Wiral  and on the  Flintshire  to the  Verrýd  or the mouth of the  Clwyd  THERE was lately a very fair prospect of adding much to the trade of the city by an i  land navigation  CANAL  which was begun  with great spirit a few years ago It was to run through the county beneath  Beeston  castle and to terminate near  Middlewich  Another branch was to extend to  Namptwich  One mouth opens into the  Dee  below the watertower A fine bason is formed into which the boats are to descend by means of five successive locks beneath the northern walls of the city cut in the live rock A few miles of this design are completed but by an unhappy miscalculation of expence and by unforeseen difficul∣ties occurring in the execution such enormous charges were in∣curred as to put a stop for the present to all proceedings The other branch which was to extend towards  Middlewich  was to end within a limited distance from the great canal between the  Trent  and  Mersey  navigation The great objects were the salt and cheese trade and coal for the supply of the interior parts of  Cheshire  from the vast collieries in  Staffordshire  Share also in the exportation of hardware earthenware and all the manu∣factures of the internal part of the kingdom within its reach might have been reasonably expected  THE idea of a canal along the dead flat between  Chester  and  Ince  has been long since conceived by persons very conversant in the nature of the trade of this city One mouth might have opened into the  Dee  in the place of the present another near  Ince  which would create a ready intercourse with  Leverpool  the  Weever  and the saltworks and great dairies on that river with  Warrington  and with the flourishing town of  Manchester  and a numerous set of places within reach of the  Mersey  and of the canal belonging to that useful Peer the duke of  Bridgewater  to which the greatest of our inland navigations is connected  This little cut the city might and still may enjoy unenvied un∣rivalled and what is a material consideration the distance is trifling seven miles  According to  Burdet  's map  the expences small and the profits to the undertakers great  ON leaving the city I repassed  Hanbridge  and at the may pole took the lefthand road which is a continuation of the  Roman  road from the river The strait direction is the only proof of its antiquity till it falls into the fields on the left where its tract is often distinguishable by certain ridges or ele∣vated spots The farmer also in digging often falls on adventi∣tious matters such as gravel and remains of pavements It points towards  Eccleston  near which are the reliques of a mount the site perhaps of a small castlet It passes through  Eaton  park and crosses the  Dee  at  Oldford  THE village of  Eccleston  is prettily seated near the  Dee  ECCLESTON  and commands a view of the towers and spires of  Chester  rising above the wooded banks The most extensive prospect is from a bench on  Eccleston  hill on the roadside which takes in the vast en∣virons of  Wales Cheshire  and part of  Shropshire  forming a n admirable composition of rich cultivation bounded by hills of various forms  ECCLESTON retains the same name which it had at the Conquest It was held at that time by  Gilbert de Venables  from  Hag  Lupus  before that event by  Edwin  a freeman On the demesne land were two servants four villeyns and a boor a boat and a net Part of the place afterwards fell to the  Vernors  of  Kinder∣len  and finally by a late purchase was added by the family of  the  Grosvenours  to their antient property in this parish The church is a rectory dedicated to St  Mary  A LITTLE farther is  Eaton  EATOS  or the hamlet on the water a name the most common of any in  England  At the Conquest here was a fishery which employed six fishermen and yielded a thousand salmon This fishery has long since ceased but dur∣ing its existence the minister of  Eccleston  clamed the twentieth fish The seat of the antient family of the  Gresvenours  lies in this township a brick house built about the latter end of the last century The  Gresvenours  came in with the Conqueror and took their name from the office they held in the  Norman  court that of grand huntsman Their first settlement in this county was  Over Lostock  bestowed by  Hugh Lupus  on his great nephew  Robert le Gresvenour  In  Richard le Grosvenour  purchased and fixed his seat at  Hulme  but in the reign of  Henry  VI by the marriage of  Rawlin  or  Ralph Gresvenour  with  Jean  daughter of  John Eaton  of  Eaton  Esq  it was transferred to this place While chivalry was the passion of the times few families shon in so distinguished a manner none shewed equal spirit in vin∣dicating their right to their honors Witness the famous cause between Sir  Robert le Gresvenour  with Sir  Richard le Scrope  plain∣tiff about a coat of arms  one land or  tried before the high constable and high marshal of  England  in the reign  Richard  II and lasted three years Kings princes of the blood and most of the  bore witness in this important affair The sentence was conciliating that both parties should bear the same arms but the G  OSV  OURS  a  une lendure d  to the king The judgment  confirmed the choice is left to the defendant either to use the  bordure  or to bear the

army in during the siege of  Holt castle  and rebuilt after the cessation of the war In one window over the pew of the respectable family of  Barnston  is some very beautiful painted glass of a commander in his tent with a truncheon in his hand surrounded with the military instruments in use during the reign of  Charles  I Around these are sixteen elegant figures of different ranks of soldiery as low as the drummer with their respective badges Over the heads of the officers are coats of arms over that of the commander are those of  Gamul  and seem intended to preserve the memory of Sir  Francis Gamul  baronet the active mayor of  Chester  during the civil wars Over the heads of three others are the arms of the  Grosvenours  the  Mainwarings  and the  Barndistons  three loyalists

HOLT another small town stands on an eminence on the  Welsh  side an antient bo∣rough and corporation consisting of a mayor two bailiffs and a coroner The inhabitants with those of  Ruthin  and  Denbigh  enjoy the privelege of contributing towards sending a burgess to parle∣ment This town was incorporated by charter granted by  Tho∣mas  earl of  Arundel  dated from his castle of  Lyons  The grant is very partial  CHARTER  running in this form  To the burgesses of our town and to their heirs and successors being  ENGLISHMEN This might arise from the hatred of the lord marchers to the  Welsh  on ac∣count of the insurrection of  Glyndwr  at that time scarcely sup∣pressed This instilled into the inhabitants a spirit retained perhaps to this moment for within these few years they were the most irascible and pugnacious of all the neighbor∣hood This town is in the parish of  Gresford  but in the dio∣cese of  Chester  It is the only appertenance remaining on this side of the  Dee  of the vast grant made by  Edward  the Con∣fessor to that see of all the land on the other side of the river which he first gave and then took from our prince  Gryssydd ap Llewelyr  Doomsday Book  in  Le

poor reliques of the castle are seated close to the river and are insulated by a vast foss cut through a deep bed of soft red stone  CASTLE  which seems originally to have been thus quarried for the building of the castle This fortress consisted of five bastions and the work cut into that form to serve as a base to as many towers An antient survey I met with in the  Museum  among the  Harleian  MSS taken in by  John Norden  when it was entire will give a true idea of this curious structure It had been defended in three parts by the great chasm formed by the quarry on the fourth by the  Dee  into which jutted a great quay still to be seen in very dry seasons for it has long since been covered by the encroachment of the river  ORIGINALLY this place had been a small outpost to  Deva  Slopes and other now almost obsolete works may be seen near the castle and on the opposite side of the water and coins have been found here that put the matter out of doubt I have seen some of  Antoninus Galienus Constantinus  and  Constantius  I conjecture that the  Roman  name had been  Castra Legionis  and the  Welsh Castell Llcon  or the castle of the legion because it was garrisoned by a detachment of the legion stationed at  Chester  The  English  borderers might easily mistake  Lleon  for the plural of  Llew  which signifies a lion and so call it the  castle of Lions  as we find it styled when it came into possession of earl  Warren  and his successors  THIS country formed part of  Powysland  POWYSLAND  which when entire reached in a straight line from  Broxton  hills in  Cheshire  southerly to  Pengwern Powys  or  Shrewsbury  including a large tract in both these counties from thence through the eastern limits of  Montgomeryshire  comprehending all that county part of  Rad∣norshire  and  Breeknockshire  then turning northward included the  wmmwds of  Mowddwy Edeyrnion  and  Glyndyfrdwy Merionydd∣shire  and circuiting part of  Denbighshire  comes along part of the  Clwydian  hills to the summit of  Moelsamma  including all  Denbighshire  excepting those parts which at present constitute the lordships of  Denbigh  and  Ruthin  from hence taking  southeasterly direction to  Broxton  hills asserts its right to  M  ∣dale Hopedale  and  Maeler  in  Hintshire  I have before taken notice that  Offa  's encroachment was but temporary and of short duration I must farther observe that in the articles of pacification  Powel  's notes on  Girald  Itin  Cambr  lib ii c II  between  Henry  III and our last prince Lle  the limits of the principality experienced but a very small d  ∣minution from what it was in  Offa  's time when it was agreed that the  Dee  should be the boundary from  Wirral  to  Castra  L  num  or  Holt  and from thence a direct line to  Pengwern Powys  IT was perhaps of much greater extent under the reign of  Brochwel Ysgythrog  who was defeated by the  Saxons  at the battle of  Chester  After this event the borders became a scene of rapine the  Welsh  and the  Mercians  alternately making the the most terrible inroads ino each other's domi∣nions  BEDE Hist H  ii c z p  Sax Cir      till the time of  Offa  who passing the  Severn  with a mighty force expelled the  Britons  from their fruitful seats on the plains and reduced the kingdom of  Powys  to the western side of the celebrated ditch still known by his name The princes of  Powŷs  were then constrained to quit their antient residence at  Pengwern  or  Shrewsbury  and remove it to one not less fertile to  Mathraval  in the beautiful vale of  Meivod  From this pe∣riod their kingdom was called indifferently that of  Powys  or of  Mathraval  The plains of  Shropshire  became a confirmed part of the  Mercian  kingdom The  transsabrine  portion of  Gloucestershire  and  Worcestershire  and the county of  Hereford  submitted to the yoke but after some time the tract which forms the country above  Croesoswallt  or  Oswestry  and the two  Maelors Gymraeg  or the present  Bromsield  and  Saesneg  or the present  Flintshire Maclor  with many other  Cwmmwds  relapsed to its natural masters Such was its state till the reign of RODERIC THE GREAT prince of all  Wales  who in his mother's right possessed  North Wales  in that of his wife  South Wales  and by that of his granmother  Nest  sister and heiress to  Congen ap Cadell  king of  Powys  he added  Powysland  to his dominions  Powel  He according to the destructive custom of gavelkind divided his principa∣lity among his children to  Anarawd  he gave NORTH WALES to  Cadell  SOUTH WALES to  Mervyn  POWYSLAND Each wore a  Talaith  or diadem of gold beset with preclous stones whence they were styled  Y  Tywy  g Taleithing  or the three crowned princes  AFTER the death of  Mervyn Cadell  usurped the portion of his brother His eldest son  Howel Dda  or the Good in again united all  Wales  into one government He left four sons who divided  South Wales  and  Powys  between them while  North Wales  was assumed in by  Jevaf  and  Jago  sons to his predecessor  Edwal Voel  The confusion that ensued on this occasion prevents me from saying any thing with certainty till  Bleddyn ap Cynvyn  who ruled  Wales  at the time of the Con∣quest reunited the kingdoms of  North Wales  and  Powys  The succession to the principality passed away from his children but  Powysland  devolved to his sons which came at length entire to  Meredith  the eldest born after the contentions and slaughter usual after such partitions  Powel  notes upon  Girald  Itin  Cambr  lib ii c    MEREDITH made the

residence He unfortunately became enamoured of  Emma  an  English  lady daughter of  James  lord  Audley  who alienating his affections from his country made him one instrument of its subjection and of the destruc∣tion of his own family He took part with  Henry  III and  Edward  I against his natural prince The resentment of his countrymen was raised against him and he was obliged to con∣fine himself in his castle of  Dinas Brân  where probably grief and shame put an end to his life He left four children under age  Madoc Llewelyn Gryffydd  and  Owen  EDWARD I gave the guardianship of  Madoc  the eldest who was to have for his share the lordship of  Bromfield  and  Yale  the castle of  Dinas Brán  and the reversion of  Maelor Saesneg  after the death of his mother to  John  earl  Warren  and of  Llewelyn  who was to possess the lordships of  Chirk  and  Nanheudwy  to  Roger Mor∣timer  son of lord  Mortimer  of  Wigmore  These lords soon con∣spired to free themselves from their charge and possess them∣selves of their estates and accordingly caused the poor children to be drowned under  Holtbridge  This I discovered in a manu∣script communicated to me by the Reverend Mr PRICE keeper of the  Bodleian  library Before that the manner of their deaths was current in the country under the fable of two young fairies who had been destroyed in that manner and in the same place but the foundation of the tale was till very lately totally lost  HAVING now brought the succession to the required period I shall only say that  Gryffydd  the third son was suffered to enjoy his portion of  Glyndyfrdwy  from whom sprung OWEN the great revenger of the wrongs of his family and the fourth son  Owen  received for his share  Cynllaeth  This afterwards de∣volved to  Gryffydd  father of

October  th  AYLOFF's Rotuli  Walliae      Mortimer  that of  Chirk  The for∣mer began immediately to secure his illgotten possessions by building  Holt Castle  but dying left the finishing of it to his son  William  Before this grant a family of the name of  Holt  held this place I suppose under its lord paramount These estates continued in the family till when on the death of  John  earl  Warren  they devolved to  Edward Fitz∣alan  earl of  Arundel  in right of his wife  Alice  sister to the for∣mer  Warren  had been divorced from his wife  Joan de Baars  and had obtained from  Edward  II a grant of his  Welsh  estates and others in  Surrey  and  Sussex  in favor of  John  and  Thomas  sons of his by  Maud de Nereford  to whom he had been contracted before his marriage with  Joan  These children probably died without issue the estates reverting as he had in such a case provided to his own right heirs  Dugdale Baron i    THEY continued with the  Fitzalans  during three generations  Richard  II probably seized on them after the execution of  Richard  earl of  Arundel  for we find that unhappy prince had lodged in  Holt Castle  during his  Irish  expedition jewels to the value of  two hundred thousand marks and a hundred thousand marks in coin  Holinshed  which with the fortress were delivered to  Bolingbroke  previous to the deposal of  Richard Thomas  the son of  Richard  was restored in blood in the following reign He died in without issue and his unsettled estates fell to his sissters  Elizabeth  who had married  Thomas Mowbray  duke of  Norfolk  but then wife to Sir  Gerard Useflect  and  Joan  who had mar∣ried  William B  auchamp  lord of  Abergavenny  This occasioned a further division of these estates  Joan  's share fell again by a daughter to  Nevil  lord  Abergavenny  after which I lose fight of the succession till the reign of  Henry  VII when that prince made a grant of them to Sir  William Stanley  On his execu∣tion  Henry  not only resumed the lordship but seized on his vast effects and found in  Holt Castle  in money and plate forty thousand marks besides jewels household goods and cattle on his ground  Leicester    HENRY VIII bestowed this lordship on his natural son  Henry Fitzroy  duke of  Richmond  and had possession given him at its capital of  Holt  in by the duke of  Norfolk  and others  King ii  He enjoyed his honor but a short time dying at the age of seven∣teen in the year  IN the following reign I find it in possession of  Thomas Seymour  lord admiral and turbulent brother to the protector  Somerset  He made the fortress at  Holt  subservient to his ambi∣tious designs and formed there a great magazine of warlike stores  Dugdale Baron ii  His deserved but illegal execution again flung  Brom∣field  into possession of the crown  CASTLE  THE great earl of  Leicester  was in possession of  Chirk  and probably of the whole lordship of  Bromfield  IN  Holt Castle  was in the hands of the crown but in that year was feized for the use of the parlement by Sir  Wil∣liam Brereton  and Sir  Thomas Middhton  Whitelock  Idem    The royalists reco∣vered the possession In  February  it was closely besieged by majorgeneral Mytton  Drake  Parlem Hist xiv  and vigorously defended by the go∣vernor Sir  Richard Lloyd  of  Ecclusham  near  Wrexham  till the beginning of  April  when it was surrendered on articles the governor having permission to go beyond sea with three hun∣dred pounds and his lady to enjoy his lands being three hundred pounds a year  Whitelock  Immediately after the parlement got possession it was ordered to be demolished  THE lordship is at present in the crown under the direction of the steward of  Bromfield  and  Yale  an office in his majesty's disposal but a grant of the minerals the far more valuable part was made to the  Grosvenour  family in the reign of  Charles  I subject to the annual payment of twenty shillings An attempt was made by king  William  to alienate these important do∣mains in favor of the earl of  Portland  and his heirs for ever but on a vigorous representation of the illegality but par∣ticularly on the noble speech  British  Biogr vii app  of  Robert Price  Esq  after∣wards baron of the exchequer his majesty thought fit to with∣draw the grant already made out in the treasury The whole rents at that time resulting to the crown amounted only to a thousand a year besides mises reliefs and other contingent profits The  mise  was in  Wales  a customary present made to  the prince on his accession in old times in cattle but after its conquest changed into money It amounted to about five thousand pounds It was payed thrice in the time of  James  I first at his coming to the crown secondly on the creation of his son  Henry  prince of  Wales  thirdly on the creation of  Charles  ON leaving  Holt  I returned over the bridge and passing along a portion of CHESHIRE in a flat country with a pleasing view of the  Broxton  hills on the left I reached the site of  Shocklach  castle This with great part of the antient hundred of  Dudestan  was held after the Conquest by  Robert Fitzbugh  from  Hugh Lupus  It belonged to the barony of Malpas but on the division of it one part came to  John de Sutton  baron of Dudley the other to  Urien de Sancto Petro  What is remarkable it was held of queen  Elizabeth  as of her ma∣nor of  East Greenwich  Nothing excepting a foss marks the place of this fortress On the opposite side of the road is a vast mount probably of far greater antiquity than the castle and explora∣tory commanding a great view around By the name of  Stret∣ton  a neighboring place I conjecture that a  Roman  road went this way but my time did not permit me to search after it  AT a small distance from  Shocklach  castle I entered  Maelor Saesneg  a hundred of FLINTSHIRE disjoined from the rest of the county At the time of the making of the Doomsday book the lands about  Worthenbury Overton  and  Bettisfield  or the present parish of  Hanmer  belonged to the hundred of  Dudestan  But long before the forming of the new hundreds which according to Sir  Peter Leicester  did not happen much later than the reign of  Edward  III it is certain these places reverted to the descendants of the princes of  Powis  it seems as if it acquired the name of  Saesneg  from its having been the jointure of  Emma  widow of  Gryffydd ap Madoc  who was an  Englishwoman  It consists of these parishes  Worthenbury Bangor Hanmer  and the chapelry of  Overton  on this side of the  Dee  of  Erbistock  on the other side opposite to  Overton  and of  Hope  in the other portion of the county of  Flint  Parts in other parishes are  Iscoed  in  Melpas Penley  in  Ellesmere  and  Bod∣idris  in  Llanarmon  Part only of  Erbistock  is in  Flintshire  the rest in  Denbighshire  Be∣sides these parishes are several spots that belong to this hun∣dred insulated by the last county which form nearly a con∣nection between this and the other part of the hundred The chain is supposed to have been once entire but as many of the links were osten fields which by reason of their small∣ness were neglected and lost One of the townships of  Dutton  in  Holt  parish is known to have belonged to this hundred as that of  Abenbury Vechan  in that of  Wrexham  does at present  Osley  and  Mereford  the last in the parish of  Gresford  were by the d of  Henry  VIII added to  Flintshire  and assist to continue the chain towards  Hope  the distant portion of this hundred These were but recently made parts of  Flintshire  in comparison of the rest of  Maelor Saesneg  which was declared to constitute part of the county by  Edward  I in the  Statutum Walliae  THE lordship or superiority of the hundred was granted I be∣lieve by  Henry  IV to Sir  John Stanley  knight and continued in his family till the st of  Elizabeth  when  William  earl of  Derby  devised it to Sir  Randle Brerelon  and it has since devolved to Sir  Walden Hanmer  baronet and  Philip Lloyd Fletcher  esquire  THIS part of  Flintshire  is under the same government as the rest excepting the obligation of attending the county courts which is dispensed with by reason of its distance from the towns where they are held It has also a coroner of its own but eli∣gible by the county at large  THE limit between this part of the hundred and  Cheshire  is  Flannen Brook  about a mile beyond is the village and church of  Worthenbury  the last a new and neat brick building dedi∣cated to St  Deiniol  a rectory taken out of  Bangor  and made a separate parish by an act of the second of  William  and  Mary  in the presentation of the family of  Emral  The name in the Doomsday book is  Hurdingberie  before the Conquest held by earl  Edwin  I TOOK my quarters at  Broughton  BROUCHTON  a venerable wooden house in possession of my respected kinsman  Peter Davies  Esq  in right of his lady eldest sister to the late  Broughton  Esq  The  Whiteballs  were originally of  Staff  rashire  but settled here in by virtue of a marriage between  Rowland Whitehall  and  Elizabeth  daughter of  John Brouglton  The  Broughtons  de∣rived themselves from the great  Weish  stock  Tudor Trovor  earl of  Hereford  and assumed their name from this place in the reign of  Henry  VII  AT the back of this house  In the preceding page  THREAP WOOD  line instead of eldest sister  read  surviving sister  lies the noted common of  Threap∣wood  from time immemorial a place of refuge for the frail fair who make here a transient abode clandestinely to be freed from the consequences of illicit love Numbers of houses are scattered over the common for their reception This tract till of late years had the illfortune to be extraparochial at first either because it was in the hands of irreligious or careless owners or was situated in forest or desert places  Blackstone to i  it never was united to any parish The inhabitants therefore considered themselves as be∣yond the reach of law resisted all government and even opposed the excise laws till they were forced to submit but not without bloodshed on the occasion The very name of the place speaks the manners of the dwellers  Threapwood  derived from the  AngloSaxon Threapian  to  threap  a word still in use signifying to persist in a fact or argument be it right or wrong It is seated between the parishes of  Malpas Hanmer  and  Worthenbury  but belonged to none till it was by the late militia acts decreed to be in the last Still doubts arise about execution of several laws within this precinct It is to be hoped that legislature will take an opportunity of rendering the magisterial power as valid here as in other places especially when it is to be considered that there are to the amount of two hundred and sixtyseven inha∣bitants who want instruction in the doctrine of universal submis∣sion to law  FROM  Broughton  I made an excursion to  Hanmer  HANMER  distant about five or six miles passed over part of  Threapwood  and observed  in the inclosares some venerable oaks the remains of the antient forest Cross  Sarnbridge  over the  Wichbrook  which rises about two miles above in part of the

Gerard  's herbal and a small portrait of a lady  Warner a la magdalene  LADY WARNER  with long disheveled hair and a scull in her hand She was a daughter of the house and wife to a Sir  John Warner  who not content with quitting the religion of thir parents determined to quit the kingdom and embrace the mo∣nastic life Their friends applied to the king  Charles  II to divert them from their resolution His majesty with his wicked wit told them that if Sir  John had a mind to make himself one of God Almighty's fools they must have patience  Sir  John  became a Jesuit and assumed the name of brother  Clare  she a poor  Clare  of which order she performed the noviciate∣ship with marvellous obedience  I am black but comely  was the text of a preacher one day exhorting her in what is called a cloathing sermon to humility expressing that she must make herself black alluding to the habit in the eyes of the world to become more fair in the sight of the LORD The abbess on this said to the poor novice  You also  SISTER CLARE  must black your∣self  On which she went instantly into the kitchen where she blacked her face and hands with the soot of the chimney and thus became an

Banger  On the right lies  Emral Hall  the seat of the  Pul  ston  a family seteled here in the time of  Edward  I but took their name from  Puleydon  a township in  Shropshtre  The first who possessed the place was  Roger  a favorite officer of the king who after the con∣quest of  Wales  appointed him collector of the taxes raised towards  the support of the war against  France  but the  Welsh  unused to these levies seized on  de Pulesdon  and hanged him  Powel  His son  Richard  was appointed by the same prince sheriff of  Caernarvon  with a salary of forty pounds and all arrears

tenants to the king or vassals to their lord for the liberty of marrying or not marrying Thus  Gilbert de Maisuil  gave ten marks of silver to  Henry  III for leave to take a wife and  Cecily  widow of  Hugh Povere  that she might marry whom she pleased  Madox Antiq Excheq i  It is strange that this ser∣vile custom should be retained so long It is pretended that the  Amobyr  among the  Welsh  the  Lyrewite  among the  Semons  and the  Marcheta mulierum  among the  Scots  were fines paid by the vassal to the superior to buy off his right to the first night's lodging with the bride of the person who held from him but I be∣lieve there never was any  European  nation in the periods this custom was pretended to exist so barbarous as to admit it It is true that the power above cited was introduced into  England  by the  Normans  out of their own country  AMORYR  The  Amoryr  or rather  Gobr merob  was a  Eritish  custom of great antiquity paid other for violating the chaslity of a virgin or for a marriage of a vassal  Leges Walli  Glossar  and signifies  the price of a virgin  The  Welsh  laws so far from encouraging adultery checked by severe sines even unbecoming liberties  Leges Wallica  The  Amolyr  was intended as a preserva∣tive  against lewdness If a virgin was deflowered the seducer or in his stead her father paid the fine If she married he also paid the fine There is one species so singular as to merit men∣tion if a wife proved unfaithful to her husband's bed the poor cuckold was obliged to pay his superior five shillings as long as he did  cydgysgu  sleep with her but if he forbore cohabiting with her and she  cydgysgu'd  with her gallant the fine fell on the offending fair  THE  Saxons  had their  Lyrewyte  or  Lecherwyte  LYREWYTE  for the same end that the  Welsh  had their  Amobyr  The crime is mentioned often in the  Saxon  laws  Leges Saxon  once with a cruel penalty denounced against the offender and a second time with a strong dehorta∣tion from the commission In general the crime was expiated by money according to the degree of the person injured The  at this time commute in certain degrees of offence but oftener punish it with burning and other excruciating deaths  Gentoo Laws c    CONTINUE my journey to  Bangor  BANGOR  seated on the banks of the  Dee  which is here bounded on both sides by rich meadows The church has been built at

This place is celebrated for being the site of the most antient  British  monastery or rather seminary which contained two thousand four hundred monks who dividing themselves into seven bands passed their time  alternately in prayer and labor  BEDAE Hist Eccles lib ii c p  or as another writer  Cambden i  says a hundred by turns passed one hour in devotion so that the whole twentyfour hours were employed in sacred duties This pious community was dispersed after the slaughter of their bre∣thren at the battle of  Chester  and their house overthrown  Wil∣liam  the monk and librarian of  Malmsbury  cotemporary with king  Stephen  speaks of the remains in his days saying that no place could shew greater remains of halfdemolished churches and multitudes of other ruins that were to be

name of the first is retained in that of a place called  Clai  of the other in a house called  Hogan  The precincts must have been large as the monks maintained themselves by the labor of their own hands The simple and unlearned provided meat and cloathing for the learn∣ed and distributed to the poor all superfluities It sent forth many thousands of religious and its same would have been immaculate had it not produced the celebrated  Pelagius  about the year the same who is usually stigmatized by the name of the archheretic Two of his tenets perhaps in these days may give him many proselytes  That good works were meri∣torious and that unbaptized infants ran no hazard of dam∣nation  THE monks of this community in common with all the  Bri∣tish  clergy were strenuous opposers of the usurpation of the church of  Rome  Seven bishops and a great number of learned men were deputed from  Bangor  to meet the famous missionary  Augustine  the monk when he insisted on their concurrence with his demands with such insolence that they left him determined to maintain the original rites of their own church which re∣mained pure and independent of all foreign prelates for many centuries after that period  Augustine  threatened the  Britons  with the resentment cf the  Saxons  How far he instigated  Edi  fred  in his invasion does not appear but if BEDE may be depended on

 I MUST not leave this neighborhood without observing that the little owl  Brit Zool  i N  o    that rare  English  species has been shot in some adjacent woods It is very frequent abroad where they

came in and in into  Essex  and waged war against the multiludes of mice in those times destroying the country but whether they were owls of this species I cannot determine I am assured by Mr STUART that this kind visits  Attica  in vast flocks every spring and breeds there It is no wonder that the  Athenian  goddess should have this bird as her conco∣mitant being so very common there It is very frequently ex∣pressed on the  Athenian  coins and sculptures and I have seen it placed on the hand of a statue of hers in the noble collection belonging to  William Weddel  Esq  at  Newby  in  Yorkshire  WITHIN a small distance from  Overton  I entered the county of SALOP or SHROPSHIRE at  Trenchlane  once infamous for its depth and badness This county was peopled by the  Cornavii  and till the time of  Offa  was divided between the princes of  Powys  and the  Mercian  king∣dom but  Offa  after his expulsion of the  Welsh  from their an∣tient seat of  Pengwern  or  Shrewsbury  added their part to his dominions At the Conquest it was possessed by the brave  Edwin  the last earl of  Mercia  On his death it was bestowed by the Conqueror on  Roger de Montgomery  a potent  Norman  the first earl of  Arundel  and  Shrewsbury  THE country  ELLESMERE  for the greatest part of the way to  Ellesmere  is flat dirty and unpleasing On the approach to the town be∣comes more agreeable and about it breaks into most beauti∣ful risings fertile and finely wooded the bottoms are indeed destitute of rivers but frequently filled with little lakes called here  meres  elegantly bordered by the cultivated hills It is singular that none of them are the parents of streams their encrease from rains and springs and their loss by exhalations keep such equal pace  ELLESMERE is a town seated on a lake of a hundred and one acres in dimensions and whose greatest depth is twentysix yards well stocked with fish  THE environs have two advantages superior to the other lakes A good town borders on one side the fine park of  Ockle  or  Ottley  is a great ornament to another The property of the water is in the duke of  Bridgewater  THE town is of  Saxon  origin and takes its name from the water which was called  Aelsmere  or the  greatest mere  being the chief in this part of the county The place has little to boast of except its situation The principal trade is that of malt the barley of the neighborhood being remarkably good  THE castle stood on a vast artificial mount on a rising ground  CASTLE  with three great ditches on the more accessible side At present not a vestige is to be seen the top being formed into a bowl∣inggreen that may vie with any in  England  for the elegance  and extent of inland prospect of the lake beneath of the rich country and woods surrounding the town

Conquest and on that event by  Roger de Montgomery  IN it was transferred to a prince of  North Wales Henry  II in that year assembled a council at  Oxford  and among other regulations for the security of the kingdom bestowed on  David ap Owen  his natural sister  Emma  with the lordship of  Ellesmere  as a portion This the politic monarch did in hopes of retaining the affections of  David  and to prevent a breach with the  Welsh  who gave him such great disturbance and so often baffled his greatest endeavors to subdue them during the reign of  Owen Gwynedd  father to  David  This alliance answered his purpose for the  English  remained unmolested during the life of that prince  AFTER his decease  Robert Lupus  held by his bailiff this manor  AFTER this it came a second time into the hands of a prince of  Wales  King  John  by grant dated from  Dover April  th bestowed it with  Joan  his natural child by  Agatha  daughter of  Robert Ferrers  earl of  Derby  on  Llewelyn ap Jorwerth  It is probable that  John  hoped by means of his soninlaw to ter∣rify  the lord marchers into obedience but the unfortunate mo∣narch reaped no benefit from the alliance  Joan  proved un∣faithful to our prince's bed who hanged  William de Breos  author of his disgrace and turned his arms against the  English  This induced  John  to divest  Llewelyn  of the government of so im∣portant a fortress as a frontier castle for by a writ dated from  Warwick  in the tenth year of his reign he orders the govern∣nor  Bartholomew Turol  to deliver it instantly to  William  earl of  Salusbury  and  Thomas  of  Endinton  But still left the revenues of the lands to his daughter  IN the fourth or  Henry  III or the year  Roger L'Estrange  yielded to the king the manors of  Colmere  and  Hampton  but received them again together with the hundred of  Ellesmere  and its castle but for life only  In or the st of the same monarch it appears that  John L'Estrange  was governor of the castle Four years after this  Henry  determined no longer to leave a place of this con∣sequence in the hands of the  Welsh  Accordingly we find him obliging  David ap Llewelyn  to make a formal renunciation of this territory which he cedes for ever The treaty was dated from  Alnet  on the  Elwy  on the feast of the decollation of St  John the Baptist  in  IN the th of  Henry  III the manor and castle of  Ellsmere  were committed to  John de Grey  paying an annual fine of ten shillings  IN the d year or  Peter de Montfort  was governor of the castle In the st the manor castle and hundred were granted to  Hamon L'Estrange  and his  with a provision  HALSTON  out of the escheat of the manor castle and hundred of a hundred pounds a year This nobleman took a large share in the barons wars was excommunicated for his insolence by the archbishop of  Canterbury  but returning to his allegiance was employed in places of trust which he discharged with the ut∣most fidelity It is said that he purchased the manors of  Coal∣mere  and  Hampton  from  Peter de Montfort  which he left to his brother Sir  Roger L'Estrange Edward  I in the fourth year of his reign on the surrender of the grant of  Hamon  which was to him and his heirs confirmed it anew on condition he would receive the castle and hundred of  Ellesmere  for life and the remainder to the king in fee This  Roger  by the king's warrant granted several parcels of the manor to different per∣sons and about the same time the wastes and commons were inclosed and converted into freeholds  In  Edward  II on the insurrection of the earl of  Lan∣caster  appointed  Oliver de Ingehan  governor of the castle  Ed∣ward  III in after causing the encroachments made on this manor to be reduced bestowed the castle and the hamlets of  Colmere  and  Hampton  on Sir  Eubule L'Estrange  younger son of baron  L'Estrange  of  Knockin  They continued in his line till the th of  Edward  IV when by the marriage of  Joan  daughter of the last male heir with  George Stanley  eldest son to  Thomas  first earl of  Derby  they were conveyed to that great house which was possessed of them till the d of  Eliza∣beth  when  William  earl of  Derby  had licence from the queen to alienate them which he did to  Richard Spencer  and  Edward Savage  and they to Sir  Thomas Egerton  keeper of the great seal and afterwards chancellor of  England  and baron of  Ellesmere  It is now in possession of his descendant the duke of  Bridgewater  who has vast property about the town but no seat except a very mean one called  Birch  THE church antiently belonged to the knights of St  John  of  Jerusalem  It was granted to them by  Llewelyn  and  Ed∣ward  III confirmed to their prior the donation The vica∣rage is in the gift of the duke of  Bridgewater  The chapels of  Cockshute Dudleston  and  Penley  are dependent on it  IN the church is an alabaster figure of Sir  Francis Kynaston  of  Ottley  and another of his lady much mutilated He died in The venerable house to which this knight belonged was one of the most antient freeholds now in the parish being found to have been the property of e  Kynastons  in the d of  Ed∣ward  II It has

about the year with the advantage of wood and  water managed with excellent taste by my worthy cousin  John Mytton  Esq  The house is situated on an elevated plot of ground which rises out of an extensive flat great part of which was subject to frequent floods an inconvenience which has since been removed by the present owner at the expence of much trouble and money in draining considerable tracts of low ground whereby the neighborhood is rendered more healthy and pleasant This flat being well dotted with trees agree∣ably foreshortens the prospect till it is bounded by the magni∣ficent scenery of the surrounding hills which distinctly form in various shapes many pleasing points of view A very extensive wood flanks each side of the house which is bounded by a fine piece of water made by extending the banks of the river  Perry  and by conveying a branch of it through the lower parts of the wood inclosing several islands whose shores are shaded by very large fullgrown oaks which all together forms one of the most pleasing artificial pieces of water that is to be met with The rest of the grounds are watered with the river  Perry  a stream which used to abound with excellent pike perch trout dace gudgeons crayfish and eels till modern luxury gave an additional spur to the dexterity of poachers a grievance complained of though encouraged in this as well as in most rivers in the

sister's son of  Pain Peverel  lord of  Whittington  and by the marriage of his second daughter  Mellet  with  Guarine de Mets  a noble  Lorrainer  it became his property about the year The deeds of arms and feats of chivalry made their progeny the admiration of the times and the subject of highflown romance  Guarine  then lord of  Ab∣berbury  and sheriff of the county hears of the resolution of  Mellet  to marry no one but the knight of most distinguished prowess The emulous youths were to assemble at  Peverel  's place or the castle in the  Peak  there to approve their worth Our knight appears among the rest with his  sylver shelde and a proude pecok upon his beualme creste  overthrows his rivals car∣ries off the fair prize and receives the lordship of  Whittington  as her dower His posterity assumed the name of  Fitzwarine  continued lords of this place for near four hundred years and every heir for nine descents preserved the Christian name of  Fulk  THIS warlike race and their warlike neighbors the  Welssh  had perpetual feuds their spirits were too congenial to enjoy peace  Guarine  and the prince of  Wales  instantly attacked each other The son of  Conan  had the advantage  Dugdale Baron  i  and carried destruction  through all the borders  Guarine  died in the reign of  and left behind him a son the first  Fulk Fitzwarine  one of the great glories of his race who shone preeminent in the  line  LOVE was the first inducement in the days of chivalry to great actions in youthful breasts  Fulk  becomes enamour  with  Hawise  the daughter of his guardian  Joos  At her request he relieves the father from most eminent danger and recent her hand in reward  To him was entrusted by  Henry  I the care of the march  about the year from which he was styled  Fulco  or  the  lieutenant  It was not long before he found employ for  sword The brave  Gryffydd ap Conan  carried his arms  the borders had a personal engagement with our hero  ∣ed a wound in his shoulder and was obliged to seek safety flight but the victor did not escape unhurt  Dugdale Baron i  In future en∣terprizes he was less fortunate the  British  prince wrested from him the lordship and castle of  Whittington  which by a su∣ceeding treaty with  Henry  II in the second year of his reign  Owen Gwynedd  thought proper to retain and  Fulk  was  pensated by a grant of the honor of  Alston  in  Gwynedd∣shire  He died in an advanced age and was buried at  Abberbury  I MUST not forget that it is related of this  Fulk  that being at the play of chess with  John  second son to  Henry  II he received from him a blow with the board which he returned with such violence as almost to demolish the young prince  THE succeeding  Fulk  did not degenerate from his ancestors He rendered himself so renowned in the wars abroad that a  French  romance was composed on the actions of himself and progenitors and translated into  English  under the title of the  Gestes of  GUARINE  and his sonnes  Much of it is preserved in the first volume of  Leland  's  Collectanea  p  It consists as in the case of most writings of this nature of a mixture of some truth with much fiction  To him was restored the castle of  Whittington  and its depen∣dencies after satisfaction had been made by king  John  to  Wrenoc  and  Wennen  the sons of  Meyric  on whom the prince of  Wales  had bestowed it in the reign of  Henry  II  Wrenoc  received cer∣tain lands in the neighborhood which he was to hold by the service of being the king's  Latimer  or interpreter in these parts between the  Welsh  and the  English  Blunt  's antient tenures    Fulk  notwithstanding this fell afterwards from his allegiance to  John  and was excommu∣nicated by name  Rymer  for his defection from that monarch but his sufferings were in the cause of liberty for he was among the glorious band who obtained from  John  the charter so highly prized by every true  Briton  IT appears that he did not neglect in the following reign to obtain a confirmation of these estates and to secure them to all posterity He obtained in from  Henry  III a grant of  Whittington  to him and his heirs for which he gave the king two hundred and sixtytwo pounds and two coursers He also procured the liberty of a market here on a  Wednesday  and a  fair on St  Luke  's day for which he presented his majesty with a palfrey  FAIRS  The first is lost There are still considerable fairs or shews of cattle on the last  Thursdays  in  April July  and  September  FROM another favor bestowed on him by the same monarch in the year it appears that probably the castle of  Whitting∣ton  had been dismantled by the  Welsh  for  Henry  gives permis∣sion to this  Fulk  to fortify it The memory of this is still pre∣served in a room in the gateway by the figure of a knight on horseback coarsely painted on the wall with the following lines now almost obliterated placed beneath  This was Sir  Foulk Fitzwarren  late a great and valiant knight  Who kept the  Britons  still in awe and oftimes put to flight  He of this castle owner was and held it by command  Of  Henry  late surnamed the third then king of all this land  His grandfather a  Lorrainer  by fame was much befriended  Who  Peverley  's daur took to wife from this  Foul  descended  His antient feats of chivalry in annals are recorded  Our king of  England  afterwards him baron made and lorded  DUGDALE informs us that this baron was drowned in a river at the battle of  Lewes  fighting in behalf of the king but Mr  Mytton  reasonably supposes that it must have been his son who appeared in the field that day for from the time that this  Fulk  was appointed lieutenant of the marches by  Richard  I to that of the battle seventyfive years had elapsed so it is pro∣bable that he was dead or at lest unable to act the warrior His son therefore must have been the person who fell in that fatal action followed by a body of hardy soldiers raised in  these marches inured to war by their frequent conflicts with the  Welsh  IMMEDIATELY on the defeat the rebel victor  Montfort  earl of  Leicester  appointed  Peter de Montfort  a creature of his own governor of this castle and soon after making use of the cap∣tive monarch's power against himself obliged him  Rymer i  to resign to  Llewelyn ap Gryffydd  prince of  Wales  the hundred of  Ellesmere  several of the border castles and among others that of  Whit∣tington  and its appertenances This writ was dated from  Here∣ford June  d  Henry  also ceded to him the sovereignty of  Wales  and homage of all the  Welsh  barons and the lord of  Whittington  These grants were afterwards confirmed to him by  Henry  with the homage of the neighboring counties which were usually paid to princes ancestors in consideration of marks paid by  Llewelyn  IN  Fulk  attended  Edward  I in his expedition against the  Welsh  and was rewarded by the grant of freewarren on his lands in this manor  IN he had a feud with his potent neighbor  Richard  earl of  Arundel  but it was prevented by the interference of the king  HE died in the reign of  Edward  II His son was at that time in  France  in his majesty's service whose lady  Alionora  had livery of the manor till her husband could return to do homage  IN or the d of  Edward  III the new earl was accused by  Edmund  earl of  Kent  uncle to the king of raising seditious  reports that  Edward  II was still alive and endeavouring to excite a rebellion For this offence his castle of  Whittington  was seized but by the intercession of his peers restored to him the following year  IN the insurrection of  Owen Glyndwr  the vassals favored his cause but their lord obtained a pardon for them from  Henry  IV  IN the th of  Henry  V this illustrious race became ex∣tinct in the male line the last  Fulk  dying in his nonage leav∣ing  Elizabeth  his only sister heiress to his estates She married  Richard Haukford  Esq  who dying in the th of  Henry  VI left an only daughter  Thomasine  She married Sir  William Bourchier  created on that account lord  Fitzwarine  A descendant of his John earl of Bath exchanged this manor with  Henry  VIII for other lands  Edward  VI granted it to  Henry Grey  duke of  Suffolk  and  Mary  on his attainder bestowed it on  Henry  last earl of  Arundel  of the name of  Fitzalan  It was by him mortgaged to one  William Albany  and other citizens of  London  The last released their title to  Albany  who foreclosed the estate His great grandaughter and sole heiress married  Thomas Lloyd  of  Aston  Esq  in this county  THE castle stands on a flat the gateway  CASTLE  and the ruins of two vast round towers with cruciform slips by way of windows still remain and the bare vestiges of two others may yet be traced It had been surrounded by a moat and several vast ditches which comprehended several other works The moat was filled by a rivulet that rises near  Pentre Pant  in the parish of  Sela∣tyn  On entering this parish it is lost for near a mile and emerges in the fields on the back of the castle  IT is probable that this was a place of defence from the time of its earliest possessors No place on the borders of unfriendly nations could possibly remain unfortified but the architect of the castle whose ruins we now contemplate was certainly the great  Fitzwarine  granson of Guarine founder of the family These were among the greatest of the barons called  Lord marchers of Wales  of whose origin an ample account will be given in the appendix  THE steward of the manor holds annually a courtleet and courtbaron in a room in the castle  STEWARD  to which the inhabitants are summoned and fined one penny each for nonattendance Chiefrents are payed to the lord and a heriot of the best beast is clamed at the death of most of the freeholders within the lordship  THE church  CHURCH  dedicated to St  John  the  Baptist  is a rectory valued in the king's books at  l    s  It is a small building supposed to have been originally designed as the chapel to the castle and made out of the refuse materials of that fortress by its founder According to the tradition of the place he was buried in the porch it being an act of devotion in those days for all persons on their entrance into churches or religious houses to pray for the souls of the founders and benefactors  Fulk Fitzwarine  seventh of the name who had the greatest revenue of any of the family by will dated the th of  Rich∣ard  II directed that his body should be buried in the chancel The largest part of his estates were in other counties but he gave this place the preference as the antient seat of the family  IN the year a commission was issued from the council in the marches of  Wales  to  John Trevor  and  Richard Lloyd  gentle∣men to make a terrier of the glebeland and to return an in∣ventory of the furniture belonging to it among which were found three pair of armour furnished with two pikes and two headpieces These seem to have been designed for the use of the rector for the defence of the castle in case of any sudden inroad of the  Welsh  AFTER leaving the village in the road towards  Oswestry  I observed on the right  Trenewydd  a seat of  Watkin Williams  Esq  in right of his mother heiress of the place Her gran∣father  Edward Lloyd  Esq  who died in was eminent for his learning and had prepared materials for the history of this his native country Continue my journey to OSWESTRY a considerable town about two miles distant from  Whittingtion  OSWESTRY  a place celebrated in  Saxon  history and legendary piety On this spot on  August  th  Sax Chron    was fought the battle between the Christian  Oswald  king of the  Northumbrians  and the Pagan  Penda  king of the  Mercians Oswald  was defeated and lost his life The barbarian victor cut the body of the slain prince into pieces and stuck them on stakes dispersed over the field as so many trophies or according to the antient verses that relate the legend his head and hands only were thus exposed  Cujus et abscissum caput abscissosque lacertos  Et tribus affixos palis pendere cruentos  Penda  jubet per quod reliquis exempla relinquat  Terroris manefesta sui Regemque beatum  Esse probet miserum sed causam fallit utramque  Ultor enim fratris minime timet  Oswius  illum  Immo timere facit Nee rex miser immo beatus  Est qui fonte boni fruitur semel et sine fine  'Three crosses rais'd at  Penda  's dire commands  'Bore  Oswald  's royal head and mangled hands  'To stand a sad example to the rest  'And prove him wretched who is ever blest  'Vain policy for what the victor got  'Prov'd to the vanquish'd king the happier lot  'For now the martyr'd saint in glory views  'How  Oswy  with success the war renews  'And  Penda  scarcely can support his throne  'Whilst  Oswald  wears a neverfailing crown'  IT is probable that the  Britons  bestowed on the spot where the battle was fought the name of  Maes hîr  or the  long field  or combat from the obstinacy of the conflict The  Saxons  for a considerable time retained the name of the place where the action was fought with the addition of their own vernacular word  feld  or  selth  a field as  maserfeld maserfelth  and corruptly  masafeld  Campus  Mesafeld  sanctorum canduit  Ossa  Henry of Huntingd  n  lib  iii p    The bones of saints at  Mesafeld  were bleach'd  IN afterdays the name became entirely  Saxon  and from the fate of the king was styled  Oswald's tree  now  Oswestry  and by the  Welsh  rendered  Croesoswallt  Before this event and for a long space beyond this tract was the property of the  Bri∣tons  till it was conquered by  Offa  and brought within the verge of his famous ditch  A PRINCE so dear to the church as  Oswald  and so attached to the professors of the monastic life received every posthumo  honor that they could bestow He was raised to the rank of  saint and his sanctity confirmed by numberless miracles  reliques which were removed the year following by  Osw  we  efficacious in all disorders incident to man or beast The  spot on which his pious corpse had lain imparted its virtue  the mere contact  MIRACLE  the horse of a traveller wearied by exc  of labor stopt here lay down and rolling about in agony luckily tumbled on the place where  Oswald  fell No sooner had he touched the ground than he sprung up in full vigor His master a man of great sagacity marked the spot mounted his nag and soon reached his inn There he found a young wo∣man ill of the palsy He told the adventure of his horse per∣suaded her friends to try the same remedy caused her to be transported there and she instantly found the same be∣nefit  B  de  Hist Eccles lib iii c are all replete with  of this kind    A CHURCH arose on the place of martyrdom  CHURCH  dedicated to the saint A monastery was founded which bore the name of  Blan  minster Candida ecclesia album monasterium  and  Whiteminster  It is very singular that no evidences exist either of the time of the foundation or of the dissolution The last must have hap∣pened in  Saxon  days for immediately after the Conquest the church of St  Oswald  was bestowed on the abby of  Shrews∣bury  Bishop  Tanner  doubts whether there ever was a monastery here  Monasticon    but the authority of  Leland  puts this much out of the questionthat there once stood here some sort of religious foun∣dation for he expressly says that the cloisters with tombs of the monks remained in the memory of man  Itin  v  I am in∣clined to think it to have been collegiate a species of esta∣blishment very frequent in places of martyrdoms or of assassina∣tions reverential or expiatory according to the nature of the event Something of this kind existed here toward the  end of the reign of  Henry  II for  Reinerus  bishop of St  who had a house near the place alienated all the tythes of  and corn of this church and its chapels These served to main∣tain twelve priests but  Re  er  bestowed the revenues on the monks of  Shrewshury  and by the papal authority expelled the antient seculars  Powel  's note on  G  ald  Ca  br Itin Goodwin dePraesul Angl  I must remark that most of them had law∣ful wives for the  Welsh  clergy for a long time resisted the im∣position of the church of  Rome  in the article of celibacy as well as several others  GIRALDUS CAMBRENSIS attended the archbishop of  Cantenbury  to this place in order to incite people to take arms for the  purposed  Crusade  It is singular that he mentions as little of  G  rala Ca      as he does of    He says he went from  Chester  towards  Album Monasterium  where he was met by  Gryffydd ap Med    and    and several other  Welshmen  of distinction Some under∣took the romantic war and according to custom were make  with the sign of the cross by  Rei  er  When that business  over they entered the town of  and were most mag∣nificently entertained by the young earl of earl of  Arunded  after the  fashion which  G  raldus  seems to think savored too much of laxury  SOME writers entertain doubts whether this place was the  Al  m Monasterium  visited by  Giraldus  and endeavor to fix it  W  lu  ch but those may be easily removed when it is cer∣tain that it was in  Pow  s  and  a pretension that the other has  clame to besides Osw  s  try and  are mentioned as

had made to the  ee of St  A  G  dwi  's catalogue of  English  bishops      AT Present  OSWALD'S WELL  there is not a relique of any old building ex∣cepting of the ruins of a chapel over a remarkably fine  that still bears the name of the saint and near the church is  spot moated round whose house is now quite unknown  I MUST add  CAENET  that near the town is a field called  Caenes  or  Heavenfield  which some have imagined to have been the place of his martyrdom His life and death hath given two places that title for the  Saxon Heafenseld  in  Northumberland  has the same meaning and received it on account of the victory he obtained there over the  Cumbrian  prince  Oswald  attributing his success solely to the intervention of Heaven  THE present church is of no great antiquity  CHURCH  is spacious and has a handsome plain tower We learn from a monument in memory of Mr  Hugh Y    that the old church was demolished in I suppose that the present immediately rose on the ruins It stands quite out of the town in a suburb without the  Newgate  is a vicarage under the patronage of the earl of  Powys  who is also lord of this extensive manor Part of this parish still use the  Welsh  language for which reason divine ser∣vice is in a certain proportion read by the minister  THE town was fortified with a wall and four gates  WALLS AND GATES  That called the  Blackgate  is demolished the  Newgate  the  Willowgate  and the  Beatricegate  still remain The last is a handsome build∣ing with a guardroom on both sides and over it the arms of the  ala  s  a lion rampant It probably was built by  Thomas  earl of  Arundel  in the beginning of the reign of  Henry  IV who bestowed the name on it in honor of his wife  Beatrix  natural daughter to the king of  Portugal  OVER the  Newgate  is the figure of a horse in full speed with an oaken bough in his mouth There is a conjecture but I will not pretend to say how well warranted that it alluded to the g  ous breed of horses which  Po  ysland  of which this was part  was  for  ived from fome tine  Spanish  stallions intro∣  by  word B  sme  earl of  ews  ury  were beg  n in the year or the sixth or

filled with water from the neighboring  l  ts  THERE are only a few fragments of the castle remaining  CASTLE  It stood on an artificial mount with a great foss extending to the  Beatricegate  on one side and on the other to the  Willow  gate Our  Welsh  historians attribute the foundation to  Mad  ap Mer  ap B  yn  prince of Pow  s in  p        Leland  Itin  v  gives some color to this by sayins that in his time there was a tower called  but the  L  sh  records place it in possession of A  a noble  N  an  who received it immediately from  the Conqueror on his accession This  A  n  was the stock of the  Fitzala  earls of  A  n  el  a potent race that flourished with fewer checks than usual with greatness for near five hundred years  SIR WILLIAM DU  LE  Baronage  says that there was a castle at  at the time of the Conquest which I think pre∣  e The artificial mount on which it was placed indica  to have been earlier than the  N  rman aer    The  Brit  ns  and the  gave their fortresses this species of elevation The  Norm  n  bulk on the f  m and natural so  l or rock but often  made use of these mounts wnich they found to have been the site of a  Saxon  castle I believe this to have been the case with that in question A  Fitzalan  repaired or rebuilt and added to that which he met with here a tower also as is not unfrequent might receive th  name of  M  dor  complimentary either to the son of Meredydd or some other great man of the same title  THIS castle was the residence of the  Norm  n  owners and had been completely finished I had its  or yard which compre∣hended that part or the town still called the  Bail  y  head its  Barbican  or outergate where the maimed and blind were com∣monly relieved a mount on the outside of the great ditch was the site of this building and from the use bears to this day the name of  Cripplegate  Lastly it had its chapel placed at a little distance dedicated to St  Nicholas  and was in the gift of the earls of  Arundel  I WILL not tire the reader with a dry list of successors to this place or the guardians of such who were under age I will only observe that after the execution of  Edmund  earl of  Aru  del  on the reign of  Edward  II his queen to shew her predilection to her gentle  Mortimer  obtained the possession of it for that favorite  THE town was favored with considerable priveleges from its  als Its first charter from its brevity called by the  Welsh  Gw  a  or the short charter  Harl  ian  MSS N  o    was granted by  William  earl  in the reign of  Henry  II  SHARTA  G  T    I must observe here that  parted to the burgesses the same priveleges with  of  ury  THE same  William  in a scutage made in kins  John  's ti  was not to do ward at any place but  Blancminster  for the knights fees held by him nor to furnish more than ten soldier  horse or foot within the county of  Salop  nor more than five out of it  HIS son  John  took part with the barons against king  J  who in revenge marched to  Oswestry  in  Wy  's Hist  Wales    and reduced the town to ashes On the death of that prince he was reconciled to his successor  Henry  III  FAIR  and in obtained for his m  ∣nor of  Blancminster  the grant of a fair upon the eve the day and the day after the feast of St  Andrew  He also make the bailliffs clerks of the market with power to imprison  persons who used fraudulent ways in buying or selling  which they payed the consideration of twenty marks These people frequently abused their power it is therefore no wonder that so many of the grievances which the  Welsh  so much com∣plained of to  Edward  I should originate from this place  Powel      IN this unfortunate town experienced a second destruc∣tion being again burnt by  Llewelyn ap J  rwerth  prince of  Wales  Idem  Provision was now made against future insults for in the next reign that of  Edward  I the town was surrounded with walls This happened when that politic monarch meditated the conq  of  Wales  therefore thought proper to secure this town  of the keys of the country with proper defence  IN  the reign of his unfortunate son  Edmund  earl of  Arundel  was commanded to raise two hundred foot  diers out of  Colne  and this neighborhood to repel the  Scots  IN  Edward  III granted another fair to this town and in directed  Edmund Fitzalan  to raise two hundred of his vassals from  Clun  and  Oswestry  to attend him in the  French  wars  IN  Richard  earl of  Arundel  being attainted and executed the king  Richard  II seized all his lands and manors and granted them to  William le Serope  earl of  Wiltshire  one of his fa∣vorites  FIRST ROYAL CHARTER  He also granted to the town the first royal charter incorporating it by the name of the bailiffs and burgesses of OSWESTRY  infra Palatinatum  CESTRIAE  in marchid inter  ANGLIAM  t  WALLIAM This was also founded upon the conssitution of that of  Shrewsbury  They were exempted throughout the king∣dom the liberty of the city of

gave it a release in from a hundred pounds that they were indebted to him in considera∣tion of the distresses the town suffered during the insurrection of  Glyndwr  He also obtained a pardon from the king for his vassals in  Chirk  r  field  and this manor for the share they took in that commotion  IN the same year with the release he granted a most ex∣tensive charter to the town containing many matters that shew  the customs of the times and merits on that account a detail of some of the particulars To began with a most essential one  HIS CHARTER  Neither the lord or his heirs should confiscate or seize the effects of persons dying with or without will in the corpora∣tion THAT no burgess should be compelled to be the  o  d's receivergeneral but only collector of the issues arising within the borough THAT the burgesses should be discharged from all fees demanded by the constable of the castle or any  his menial servants for any felonies or trespasses committed out of the same liberties when brought to the prison of the castle saving that the constable might receive one penny a  his own election from every mansionhouse in the town and a farthing of every cottage on the feast of St  Stephen  annually THAT the burgesses should be freed for the future from  excise of ale brewed and sold in the town which had been hitherto payable at the rate of seven pence for every

license while any ale brewed in the town was to be had under the penalty of six shillings and eight pence THAT none of the inhabitants of the lord∣  hips of  Oswestry Mel  erl  y Kinards  ey Egerley

none of the lord's tenants should be compelled to pay the  redditus advocarii  for the security of the castle  c c  UNTIL the time of the abovementioned charter  GUARD AT THE GATES  the lord's  Welsh  tenants of the hundred of  Oswestry  were accustomed by their tenure to keep watch and ward for three days and three nights at the four gates of the town during the fairs of St  Andrew  and St  Oswald  with a certain number of men called  Kaies  but these treacherously with others ravaged and plundered the place On this the tenants were compelled to pay a sum of money as wages to a sufficient number of  Englishmen  as the burgesses should think convenient for the custody of the four gates and the  Welshmen  were for ever to be discharged from that duty  THE vassals of the earls of  Arundel  in these parts were of a mixed nature either descendants of the  Norman  followers of their ancestor  Alan  or of the native  Welsh  who were most nu∣merous and bore an hereditary dislike to their cotenants of foreign stock The  welsh  part was called  walcheria  and lay in the upper part of the manor  THIS charter of earl  Thomas  was confirmed by his several suc∣cessors to the time of  Henry  VIII  Charles  II granted another  in which a mayor twelve aldermen fifteen commoncouncil a highsteward and recorder compose the body corporate  ABOUT a mile from  Oswestry  in the parish of  Sellatyn  lies a fine military post on an insulated eminence of an oblong form which has been fortified with much art The top is an exten∣sive area containing fifteen acres three roods and eight perches of fertile ground surrounded with two ramparts and fosses of great heighths and depths At a distance from these at the foot of the hill is another deep foss which surrounds the whole and ends as do the two others at the two entrances which are placed diagonally opposite to each other On the slope of the hill on both sides of one entrance are a range of deep oblong trenches running transversely between the second ditch and another which seems to be designed for their immedi∣ate protection for the first extends no farther than these trench∣es the other to no great distance beyond them  THIS place is called  Old Oswerstry  OLD OSWESTRY  H  n Ddinas  and antiently  Caer Ogyrfan  from  Ogyrfan  a hero coexistent with  Arthur  There is no certainty of the origin of it some ascribe it to  Oswald  or to  Penda  and imagine that it was possessed before the battle of  Maserfeld  by one of those princes Others think it to have been the work of the antient  Britons  to which opinion I in∣cline The strength and the labor in forming it evince that it was not a sudden operation like that of a camp Its con∣struction even to the oblong trenches is  British  for example that of  Bryn y

miles till the latter is totally lost  OFFA'S ditch extended from the river  Wye  OFFA'S DIKE  along the counties of  Hercford  and  Radnor  into that of  Montgomery  where I shall  take it up at its

reason appears why its course was not continued from sea to sea It seems probable that  Offa  imagined that the  Clwydian  hills and the deep valley that lies on this side at their base  would serve as a continuance of his prohibitory line he had carried his arms over most part of  Flintshire  and vainly ima∣gined that his labors would restrain the  Cambrian  inroads in one part and his orders prevent any incursions beyond these na∣tural limits which he had decreed should be the boundaries of his new conquests The weakness of this great work appeared on the death of  Offa  the  Welsh  with irresistible fury despised his toils and carried their ravages far and wide on the  English  marches Superior force often repelled our countrymen San∣guinary laws were made by the victorious  Harold  against any that should transgress the limits prescribed by  Offa  The  Welsh∣man  that was found in arms on the  Saxon  side of the ditch was to lose his righthand  Leland Collect  iii  Joannes Sarishuriensis  as quoted by  Camden      IT is observable that in all parts the ditch is on the  Welsh  side and that there are numbers of small artificial mounts the sites of small forts in many places along its course These were garrisoned and seem intended for the same purposes as the towers in the famous  Chinese  wall to watch the motions of their neighbors and to repel the hostile incursions  IT is remarkable that  Wat  's dike should have been overlooked or confounded with that of  Offa  by all writers except by  Tho∣mas Churchyard  the poet  Vide  Churchyard  's Worthines of  Wales  originally printed in re∣printed by  Thomas Evans    who assigns the object of the work that the space intervening between the two was free ground where the  Britons  and  Saxons  might meet with safety for all com∣mercial purposes  From  Oswestry  I took the road to  Sellatyn  SELLATYN  a parish contain∣ing about six hundred inhabitants Its register commences in was fortunately saved from the great wreck of such re∣cords by Mr  Wilding  an  Oliverian  rector in the civil wars It appears from it that the state of population in the first and the last twenty years was as follows     First  Last  Encrease  Baptisms        Weddings        Funerals        THIS happy disproportion of encrease between births and bu∣rials seems to arise from the hilly situation of the parish which slopes down to the moory flats of those of  Oswestry  and  Whit∣tington  without partaking the lest of their nature The improve∣ments in agriculture contribute much to retain numbers of the inhabitants by finding them a wholesome and innocent em∣ploy the want of which exiles multitudes in many places to the vice and disease of great cities  THE first house I visited is  Porkington  PORKINGTON  the seat of  Robert Go∣dolphin Owen  Esq  This place takes its name from a singular entrenchment in a neighboring field called  Castell Brogyntyn  a fort belonging to  Owen Brogyntyn  a natural son to  Owen Mad  ap Meredydd  prince of  Powis Vadog  Powel    It is of a circular form sur∣rounded with a vast earthen dike and a deep foss It appears  SIR  JOHN OWEN KN  T    by an old drawing in Mr  Mytton  's collection to have had two entrances pretty close to each other projecting a little from the sides and diverging the end of each guarded by a semilunar curtain These are now destroyed The whole parish consists of a single township which also bears the same title with the mansion  THE name of the house was soon altered to one very nearly resembling the present In  Henry  III in an address to  Llewelyn  prince of  Wales  informs him that among others  Ble∣ddyn Filius Oeni de  PORKINTON  Rymer i  had performed to his majesty the service he owed  I MUST now make a very long transition from this period to that which produced another distinguished personage of this family  SIR JOHN OWEN  Here is preserved the portrait of Sir  John Owen  knight of  Clenneney  in  Caernarvonshire  a gallant officer and strenuous supporter of the cause of  Charles  I He greatly signalized him∣self at the siege of  Bristol  when it was taken by prince  Rupert  and was desperately wounded in the attack Congenial qualities recommended him to his highness who superseding the appoint∣ment of archbishop  Williams  to the government of  Conway  castle in constituted Sir  John  commander in his place This fortress was soon given up to general  Mytton  by the con∣trivance of the prelate and the power of his friends and the knight retired to his seat in the distant parts of the county In he rose in arms to make a last effort in behalf of his fallen master probably in concert with the royalists in  Kent  and  Essex  He was soon attacked by  William Lloyd  sheriff of the county whom he defeated wounded and made prisoner He then laid siege to  Caernarvon  but hearing that certain of the parlement forces under the colonels  Carter  and  Twisleton  were on their march to attack him he hastened to meet them and took the sheriff with him on a litter He met with his enemies near  Llandegai  a furious recontre ensued in which Sir  John  had at first the advantage but falling in with their reserve fortune de∣clared against him in a personal contest with a captain  Taylor  he was pulled off his horse and made prisoner and his troops disheartened by the loss of their commander took to flight The sheriff died the same day The victory was esteemed of that consequence that captain  Taylor  who was the messenger of the news to the parlement received a reward of two hundred pounds out of Sir  John  's estate  Rushworth  ii part iv    SIR JOHN was conveyed to  Windsor  castle where he found four noblemen under confinement for the same cause On the th of  November  a vote past for his banishment and that of the lords  Goring Loughborough Capel  the earl of  Holland  and majorge∣neral  Langhern  Whitelock    but after the execution of their royal master sanguinary measures took place The duke of  Hamilton  the earl of  Holland  and the lords  Goring  and  Capel  were put upon their trials Sir  John  shewed a spirit worthy of his country He told his judges that  he was a plain gentleman of  Wales  who had been always taught to obey the king that he had served him honestly during the war and finding many honest  men endeavored to raise forces whereby he might get him out of prison he did the like  and concluded like a man who did not much care what they resolved concerning him In the end he was condemned to lose his head for which with a hu∣morous intrepidity he made the court a low reverence and gave his humble thanks A bystander asked what he meant he replied aloud  It was a great honour to a poor gentleman of  Wales  to lose his head with such noble lords for by G he was afraid they would have hanged him  SIR JOHN by mere goodfortune was disappointed of the honor he was flattered with being as his epitaph says  Famae plus quam vitae sollicito  He neither solicited for a pardon nor was any petition offered to parlement in his favor which was strongly importuned in behalf of his fellowprisoners  Ireton  proved his advocate and told the house  That there was one person for whom no one spoke a word and therefore requested that he might be saved by the sole motive and goodness of the house  In consequence mercy was extended to him and af∣ter a few months imprisonment he was on his petition set at liberty He retired again into his country where he died in and was interred in the church of  Penmorva  in  Caer∣narvonshire  where a small monument preserves the following epitaph  M S JOHANNIS OWEN de  Clenneney  in Co  Carnarvon  militis viri in patriam amoris ardentissimi  in regem beatissimum martyrem

engaged in the chace found in a thicket on this spot a white hind which determined him after the example of  Ethelred  king of the  Mercians  in the instance of St  John  's church  Chester  to dedicate it to sacred uses He accordingly translated to this place the an∣tient church which tradition says stood before on a spot still called  Bryn hên Eglwys  or the hill of the old church  THAT highchurch meteor  DOCTOR SACHE∣VEREL  that partytool Doctor  Sacheverel  was in presented to this living not so much on account of its value as to give him a pretence of making a progress through a long extent of the kingdom and of trying the incli∣nations of the people in the rich and populous counties he was to pass through He was met on the confines of this by horsemen among which were the first fortunes of  Shropshire  He met with respect in every town little short of adoration The crowd in  Oswestry  was so great that a good old woman could see only a small part of the holy man yet consoled her∣self with having a sight of his everblessed wig as he rode along  FROM hence I hastened towards  Chirk  castle keeping a lower road between the two dikes On approaching the village of  Chirk  is a very deep valley consisting of fertile meadows wa∣tered by the brook  Ceiriog  and finely bounded by lofty wooded banks On the very verge of that next to  Chirk  stands an ar∣tificial mount and I think the vestige of another on the other side of the road which goes between them These were explo∣ratory and probably designed also for defence and might have had on them a small fort for the protection of the pass I imagine these mounts to have been  Saxon  and coeval with the great labor of  Offa  which runs at a small distance from them  IN this deep valley  BATTLE OF CRO∣GEN  which winds along the foot of the vast  Berwyn  mountains was a bloody conflict between part of the forces of  Henry  II and the  Welsh  in  Henry  had determined once more to attempt the subjection of  Wales  and to revenge the ravages carried through the borders by its gallant prince  Owen Gwynedd  for that end he assembled a vast army at  Os∣westry Owen  on the contrary collected all his chieftains with their dependants at  Corwen  The king hearing that his antago∣nist  so near resolved to bring the matter to a speedy deci∣sion He marched towards him and in this valley finding himself intangled in impenetrable woods and recollecting his ill∣fortune among the forests of  Eulo  directed his vanguard to make the passage clear by cutting down the trees in order to secure himself from ambuscade The pikemen and flower of his army were posted to cover the workmen The spirit of the common soldiers of the  Welsh  army grew indignant at this attempt and without the knowlege of their officers fell with unspeakable fury on these troops The contest was violent numbers of brave men perished in the end the  Welsh  retired to  Corwen Henry  gained the summit of the  Berwyn  but was so distressed by dreadful rains and by the activity and prudence of  Owen  who cut him off from all supplies that he was ob∣liged to return ingloriously with great loss of men and equipage  Powel      THIS conflict is sometimes called the battle of  Corwen  but with more propriety that of  Crogen  for it happened beneath  Castelh Crogen  the present  Chirk  castle and the place is still called  Adwy'r Beddau  or the  pass of the graves  of the men who were slain here  THE church of  Chirk  is dedicated to St  Mary  CHURCH OF CHIRK  and was for∣merly an impropriation belonging to the abby of  Valle Crucis  Within is a profusion of marble cut into human forms memorial of the later lords of the place or their ladies  MONUMENTS  The best is a bust of Sir  Thomas Middleton  with a peaked beard long hair armed and by him is another of his lady a  Napier  of    Sir  Thomas  was a successful and active commander on the side of the parlement dur∣ing the civil wars Towards the end of his life he found that he had undesignedly established a more intolerable tyranny than that which he had formerly opposed In he took arms in conjunction with Sir  George Booth  in order to restore the antient constitution Sir  George  was defeated by the vigilant  Lambert  and Sir  Thomas  forced to take refuge in his castle where after two or three days shew of defence he was constrained to surrender on such conditions as the conqueror was pleased to dictate  THE other monuments are composed of large and very illexecuted figures of lady  Middleton  wife to Sir  Thomas Middleton  baronet son of the former She was daughter of Sir  Thomas Willraham  of  Woodhey  and died at the early age of twentytwo in the year  SIR RICHARD MIDDLETON and his lady  Frances  daughter of Sir  Thomas Whitmore  of  Buildas  He died in she in At their feet lies their son Sir  William  who survived his father only two years dying at the age of twentyfour  ON a small mural monument is an elegant epitaph on Doctor  Walter Balcanqual  a  Scotch  divine of distinguished character In he was appointed master of the  Savoy  hospital which he soon resigned in favor of the able but desultory  Marc Antonio di Dominis  archbishop of  Spalato  in reward for his conversion to Protestantism In he was sent to represent his country in  the famous synod of  Dort  He was promoted to the deanery of  Rochester  and in to that of  Durham  but by his great loyalty having rendered himself hated by his countrymen was in obliged to take refuge in  Chirk castle  but sink∣ing under the fatigue of the journey and severity of the weather died on  Christmasday  The epitaph was composed by Dr  Pearson  bishop of  Chester  at the request of Sir  Thomas Mid∣dleton  by whom the monument was erected  THE castle lies about a mile from the village  CASTLE  in the course of  Offa  's dike on the summit of a lofty hill projecting from the great mass of the  Berwyn  mountains Before the foundation of the present castle stood another called  Castell Crogen  and the territory around bore the name of  Tref y Waun  the property of the lords of  Dinas Brân  It continued in their possession till the death of  Gryffydd ap Madoc  a strenuous partizan of  Henry  III and  Edward  I  Edward  on the decease of  Gryffydd  rewarded two of his favorites with the guardianship of the two eldestsons of  Gryffydd Madoc  to  John  earl  Warren  and  Llewelyn  to  Roger Mortimer  son of  Roger  baron of  Wigmore  who as before related quickly dispatched the unhappy youths and possessed themselves of their fortunes Earl  Warren  seized on the lordships of  Bromfield  and  Yale Mortimer  on those of the present  Chirk  and  Nanheudwy  He became the founder of the castle It continued in his family but a short time being sold by his grandson  John  to  Richard Fitzalan  earl of  Arundel  The  Fitzalans  possessed it for three generations after which it passed to  Thomas Mowbray  duke of  Norfolk  and justice of  North Wales Chester  and  Flint  in right of his wife  Elizabeth  elder sister to  Thomas  earl of  Arundel  On  CHIRK CASTLE  the disgrace and exile of  Mowbray  in it probably was resum∣ed by the crown and granted again to  William Beauchamp  lord of  Abergavenny  who married the other sister and by the marriage of his granddaughter sole heiress of  Richard Beauchamp  earl of  Worcester  with  Edward Nevil  afterwards lord  Abergavenny  was conveyed into that family in the reign of  Henry  VI  Powel      THE next possessor which occurs to me is the unfortunate Sir  William Stanley  who as  Leland  says 'repayred it welle' After his ungrateful execution it became forfeited to his rapacious master and as I conjecture was bestowed in along with  Holt Castle  another of Sir  William  's castles by  Henry  VIII on his natural son  Henry Fitzroy  duke of  Richmond  and Somerset  King  's Valeroyal  By his early death it reverted again to the crown  IN the following reign I imagine it to have been granted to  Thomas  lord  Seymour  brother to the protector  Somerset  for I find him in possession of  Holt  Dugdale Baron  ii  to which it was an ap∣pendage  ELIZABETH granted it with the same lordships to her worth∣less favorite  Dudley  earl of  Leicester  On his death  Chirk Castle  became the property of lord St  John  of  Bletso  whose son in sold it to Sir  Thomas Middleton  knight mayor of  London  in  THIS exalted pile has much to boast of in its vast view into seventeen counties a most elegant and varied extent The castle is square and has five rounders uncommonly clumsy and  heavy Lord  Clarendon  and others speak of the entire demoli∣tion of this fortress after its reddition to  Lambert  Only one side with three towers were pulled down which Sir  Thomas Middle∣ton  lived to rebuild in one year  THE chief apartments are a saloon fiftysix feet by twentyseven and a drawingroom within a gallery a hundred feet by twentytwo filled with portraits Among them are those of the duke of  Ormond  and his son lord  Ossory  the most virtuous cha∣racters and the greatest ornaments of the vicious age of  Charles  II admired revered unimitated  Ossory  died before his father who bore his loss with the firmness of a  Roman  founded on the certain hopes of a Christian I can scarcely say whether he passed a finer eulogy on his son or satyr on the times by declaring  he would not

amiable character and lost the seals for his refusal in to affix them to the king's insidious declaration of liberty of conscience  LADY BRIDGEMAN second wife to Sir  Orlando  and mother to  Charlotte

The descent is by fortytwo steps but according to the laudable usage of its present lord the captives endure but a short and easy confinement and even that passes impercep∣tibly amidst the good cheer and generous liquors bestowed on them by the kind warder to whose custody they are com∣mitted  REPASSING through the castlegate  BARBAROUS CUSTOM  I recollect a barbarous privelege retained longer in this country than in any other part of  Britain  that of exempting from capital punishment even the most atrocious assassin by payment of a certain fine This was practised by the lord marchers of these parts in the fifteenth century and continued in  Mowddwy  in  Merionethshire  till it was abolished in the th of  Henry  VIII  Gwydir  family    THIS custom was derived from the antient  Germans  who accept∣ed a fine of cattle as a compensation for murder which satisfied the relations and was not detrimental to the public which could not fail being injured by the extension of private re∣venge  Tacitus  de mor Germ c z    THE  Saxons  continued this custom under the name of  Weregeld  WEREGELD  and accordingly set a price on every rank from the king to the peasant  Wilkin's Leges Sax  The head of the king was valued at thirty thousand  thrymses  or  l  half to be paid to his relations and half to the kingdom for the loss it had sustained that of a countryman was esteemed at two hundred and sixtysix or  l    s  THE  Weregeld  of a  Welshman  was very low for unless he had property enough to be taxed for the king's use his life was not reckoned of higher price than seventy  thrymses  or ten guineas The money or fine was distributed as in the time of the antient  Germans  among the relations of the deceased and oftentimes part went to the lord of the soil as compensation for his loss  THE  Welsh  had in like manner their  Galanas  and  Gwerth  GWERTH  of the same nature with the former but our fine was usually paid in cattle the wealth of the country  BUT the  Gwerth  was not only a compensation for murder or homicide but for all species of injuries To cuckold the prince was expiated at a very high rate  Leges Wallica    the offender was fined in a gold cup and cover as broad as his majesty's face and as thick as a ploughman's nail who had ploughed nine years and a rod of gold as tall as the king and as thick as his little finger a hundred cows for every  cantref  he ruled over with a white bull with different colored ears to every hundred cows  THE recompence to a virgin who had been seduced is very sin∣gular on complaint made that she was deserted by her lover it was ordered by the court that she was to lay hold of the tail of a bull three years old introduced through a wickerdoor and shaven and wellgreased Two men were to goad the beast if she could by dint of strength retain the bull she was to have it by way of satisfaction if not she got nothing but the grease that remain∣ed in her hands  The same  I fear by this and other penalties for the  same offence that the crime was not held by my countrymen to be of a very deep dye  WELSH SAXONS and NORMANS had each their pecuniary atonements for lesser injuries A  Welshman  for the loss of his finger received one cow and twenty pence of his nose six oxen and a hundred and twenty pence and for being pulled by the hair a penny for every finger and twopence for the thumb the instruments of the insult  Leges Wallicae    The  Saxons  had similar fines  Wilkin's Leges Saxon    and the  Normans  like persons of nice honor provided a penalty of five  sous  for a lug by the nose and ten  pour un coup au derriere  MS notes to my copy of  Les Coustumes de Normandie    THE  Scotch  had also similar compensations for homicides and injuries which in their old laws passed under the name of  Cro Galnes  and  Kelchyn  Regiam majestatem    and lastly the  Irish  had their  Eric  or satisfaction for blood  Davies  Hist  Ireland    In fact it prevaled over all parts of  Europe  with variations conformable to the several complections of the country  I CANNOT but relate the occasion of this digression Two villains who had committed a most horrid murder  They had killed a poor parson at the instigation of their chieftain because his wife had preferred the nursing another great man's child to his  in the re∣mote of parts  Wales  had fled into this neighborhood for pro∣tection about the latter end of the fifteenth century Two fa∣milies at that time divided the country with their feuds the  Kyffins  and the  Trevors  who were ready at any time to receive  under their protection any banditti that were recommended to them by their remote friends when their villanies rendered it unsafe for them to remain at home The  Trevors  at this time gave  asylum  to these murderers The friends of the person they had slain wished for revenge being at that time in league with the  Kyffins  a plot was laid to surprize the assassins  Jevan ap Meredeth  a gentleman of  Caernarvonshire  who was most anxious to obtain redress for the injury came over with six men and was directed to keep himself concealed least the  Trevors  should be alarmed and frustrate his design He accordingly kept within all day and watched all night at length the villains fell in∣to his hands The  Trevors  instantly pursued him when he was told by the  Kyffins  that if he was overtaken and the offenders rescued he would lose his revenge for according to the cus∣tom of the country they would be carried before the gate of  Chirkcastle  and be instantly cleared on the payment of five pounds This determined  Jevan  to order his followers to strike off their heads on the spot One of them executed his order but faintly when the criminal told him that if he had his neck under his sword he would  make it take a better edge  Gwydir  family    I WISH the cause had been better that applause might have been given to this contempt of death but such assassins as these could scarcely be animated with the prospect of immortality which made their remote ancestors inspired by the  Druid  songs think it disgraceful to preserve a life that was so soon to return  THE same consideration influenced the antient  Danes  a warrior  fell  Bartholinus  de Contempt mortis p    laughed and died  Thus was the end of the  Scandinavian  hero  Agnerus  Herculè nemo illo visus mihi fortior unquam  Semivigil subsedit enim cubitoque

Wales  where the refined lover of picturesque scenes the sentimental or the romantic can give a fuller indulgence to his inclination No place abounds more with various rides or solemn walks From this central spot he may as I have done visit the seat of  Owen Glyndwr  and the fine vallies of the  Dee  to its source beyond the great  Llyntegid  or pass the mountains to the fertile vale of  Clwyd  or

St  Asaph    who died in is one of the  Tri Thlws Cymru  or three beauties of  Wales  but more remarkable for its situa∣tion than structure It consists of five arches whose widest does not exceed twentyeight feet in diameter The river usually runs under only one where it has formed a black chasm of vast depth into which the water pours with great fury from a high broken ledge formed in the smooth and solid rock which composes the whole bed of the river The view through the arches either upwards or downwards is extremely pictu∣resque  NEAR the foot of the bridge opposite to the town

of the country with here and there a few freestone moldings The side which  is less steep defended by deep trenches cut through the solid rock This was one of our primitive  Welsh  castles The foun∣der is unknown I dare not attribute its origin and name to  Brennus  king of the  Gauls  who besieged the capitol and is fabled to have come into these parts to fight with his brother  Belinus  nor yet do I derive it from  Bryn  a hill nor  Bran  a crow but from the mountain river  Brân  that runs down its side  IT had been the chief seat of the lords of  Jâl  or  Yale  and probably was founded by one of them In the reign of  Henry  III it was the retreat of  Gryffydd ap Madog  who traiterously siding with the  English  against his countrymen was obliged to secure himself in this aërial fastness  ON the death of  Gryffydd Edward  I ungratefully bestowed on  John  earl  Warren  the wardship of the eldest son of his old partizan as he did that of the second on  Roger Mortimer  Both the guardians understood the meaning of the favor and accor∣dingly made away with the poor children and received full possession of their estates  Rotuli Walliae  as before related From the  Warrens  it passed by marriage to the  Fitzalans  and followed the succession of the lords of  Bromfield  THE time of its ruin is unknown  Leland  speaks of it as a demolished place and adds that an eagle built annually in the neighboring rocks that a person was wont to be lowered down in a basket to take the young and was obliged to have another basket over his head to save him from the fury of the old birds  IN  MYFANWY VE∣CHAN  this castle was inhabited by a celebrated beauty de∣scended from the house of  Tudor Trevor  and whose father pro∣bably held the castle under the earls of  Arundel

favor me with in an  English  dress  NEUD wyf ddihunwyf hoen Creirwy hoywdeg A'm hudodd  c  Sorrowing I strike the plaintive string  Deign cruel maid to hear me sing  And let my song thy pride controul  Divine inchantress of my soul  Sure  Creirwy  's charms must yield to thine  And  Garwy  's  This knight and lady seem to have been the same with  Syr Gareth  and  Damoysell Lynet  cele∣brated in the viith book of the Storye of the most worthy kynge  Arthur  Sir  Gareth  loved and was beloved by the fair  Lyones  sister to  Lynet  Their passion exceeded the bounds of discretion but  Lynet  to save their honor by enchantment prevents their loves till they are joined together in holy matrimony  sufferings to mine  Far from  Myfanwy  's marble tow'rs  I pass my solitary hours  O thou that shinest like the sky  Behold thy faithful  Howel  die  In golden verse in flowery lays  Sweetly I sang  Myfanwy  's praise  Still the disdainful haughty fair  Laughs at my pain and my despair  What tho' thine eyes as black as sloes  Vie with the arches of thy brows  Must thy desponding lover die  Slain by the glances of thine eye  Pensive as  Trystan  Trystan  was another famous knight His sorrow seems to have arose from his being deserted by a lady who as the history relates forsook him for  Syr Bleoberys  did I speed  To  Brán  upon a stately steed  Fondly I gaze but hard's my doom  Oh fairer than the cherry's bloom  Thus at a distance to behold  Whom my fond arms would fain enfold  How swift on  Alban  A  Scotch  horse  steed I flew  Thy dazzling countenance to view  Though hard the steep ascent to gain  Thy smiles were harder to obtain  Thy peerless beauties to declare  Was still thy zealous lover's care  O fairer thou and colder too  Than newfall'n snow on  Aren

disgrace  The beauties of that heavenly face  Thou art my daily thought each night  Presents  Myfanwy  to my sight  And death alone can draw the dart  Which love has fixed in my heart  Ah canst thou with ungentle eye  Behold thy faithful  Howel  die  For thee my verse shall ever run  Bright rival of the midday sun  Shou'dst thou demand thy lover's eyes  Gladly to thee I'd sacrifice  My useless sight that only shews  The cruel author of its woes  Refulgent in her golden bower  As morning in her eastern tow'r  Thy name the echoing vallies round  Thy name a thousand hills resound  Myfanwy Vechan  maid divine  No name's so musical as thine  And every bard with rapture hung  On the soft music of my song  For thee I languish pine and rave  White as  Dwrdwy  's curling wave  Alas no words can speak my pain  While thus I love but love in vain  Wisdom and Reason what are they  What all the charms of Poësy  Against the fury of thy darts  Thou vanquisher of human hearts  When first I saw thee princely maid  In scarlet robes of state array'd  Thy beauties set my soul on fire  And every motion fann'd desire  The more on thy sweet form I gaz'd  The more my frantic passion blaz'd  Not half so fine the spider's thread  That glitters on the dewy mead  As the bright ringlets of thy hair  Thou beauteous object of my care  But ah my sighs my tears are vain  The cruel maid insults my pain  And canst thou without pity see  The victim of thy cruelty  Pale with despair and robb'd of sleep  Whose only business is to weep  Behold thy bard thy poet languish  Oh ease thy bard's thy poet's anguish  And for Heaven's sake some pity shew  Ere to the shades of night I go  O fairer than the flowers adorning  The hawthorn in a summer's morning  While life remains I still will sing  Thy praise and make the mountains ring  With fair  Myfanwy  's tuneful name  And from misfortune purchase fame  Nor even to die shall I repine  So  Howel  's name may live with thine  R W  AFTER a short repose  RHIWABON  on my descent from the castle I made an excursion to  Rhiwabon  a few miles from  Llangollen  For some time the ride was along the sides of the  Dee  which wa∣tered a beautiful narrow vale The hills at length approximate so nearly as only to leave room for a most picturesque passage shaded with trees Cross a bridge called the  New bridge  and ascend for some space leaving on the left considerable pits both of coal and canal reach the village of  Rhiwabon  which takes its name from the  Avon  or little river on which it lies  THE church is dedicated to St  Mary  CHURCH  It has been lately fit∣ted up in a very neat manner by Sir  Watkin Williams Wynn  who bestowed on it an organ and a small font the last on occasion of the christening of his eldest son in is of white marble supported by a tripod of distinguished elegance  THE monument to his first wife  MONUMENTS  lady  Harriet Somerset  is in fine taste The figure of Hope reclines on an urn and is at∣tended with her usual emblem of an anchor A serpent with its tail in its mouth expressive of eternity includes the inscription on one side of the pedestal  As a contrast to this excellent performance of Mr  Nollikin  is placed against the wall a great monument of  Henry Wynn  Esq  tenth son of Sir  John Wynn  of  Gwydir  who died in His attitude is that of a fanatical preacher and his dress a fullbuttoned coat short skirts and square shoes a most un∣happy subject for the sculptor On one side kneels Sir  John Wynn  of  Wynnstay  baronet and on the other  Jane  his wife daughter to  Eyton Evans  by whom he acquired the estate He died at the age of ninetyone in and left his fortune to the late Sir  W W Wynn  He is represented blind this accident in his extreme age is mentioned in his epitaph as a benefit since his inward perceptions were improved by this bodily defect It reminds me of two lines of  Waller  in which the same idea is much better expressed  The soul's dark cottage

of now defaced arms On the top are recumbent two figures an armed man with a collar of SS and a lady lying on a cloak at their feet a lion with a monk sitting on it with his head reclined on one hand  AROUND the edges of the tomb is this inscription  Orate pro anima  Johannis ap Elis Eyton  armigeri qui obiit vicessimo octavo die menfis  Septembris  anno Domini et pro anima  Elizabeth Calfley

considerable grants of land in these parts He was of the house of  Eyton  beforemen∣tioned His grandfather was twice married to the same lady who on some pretence of consanguinity had been divorced from him after bearing him a son of the name of  Ellis  but obtaining a dispensation they were reunited in form After the second marriage were born other children A division of the estates was then

especially those towards  the  Berwyn  mountains and the august breach made into them beyond  Llangollen  by the rapid  Dee  through the country of the  irregular and wild  GLYNDWR  NANTY BELE  NANTY BELE  or the  Dingle of the Martin  lies about a mile from hence and merits a visit from every traveller From a rock at its extremity is a magnificent view of the  Dee  rolling awefully in a deep chasm fringed with woods at last terminat∣ing sullenly in a black and still pool Towards the north is a great view of the conic mountain and the rude fortress of  Dinas Brân  rising amidst a fertile vale and bounded by the barren  Alps  THE house has been built at various times The most antient is a gateway of wood and plaister dated On a wall within the court is this excellent distich allusive to the name of the house  Wynn stay  or rest satisfied with the good things Providence has so liberally showered on you  Cui domus est victusque decens cui patria dulcis  Sunt satis haec vitae caetera cura labor  The former name of the place was  Watstay  from its situation on the famous dike but was changed to the present by Sir  John Wynn  out of respect to his own name It was originally called simply  Rhiwabon  and had been the residence of  Madeg ap Gryffydd Maelor  founder of  Vale Crucis  Eyton  Pedigroe    THE new part was built by the late Sir  Watkin  is of itself a good house yet was only part of a more extensive design It is  finished in that substantial yet neat manner becoming the seat of an honest  English  country gentleman adapted to the recep∣tion of his worthy neighbors who may experience his hospitality without dread of spoiling the frippery ornaments becoming only the assemblyrooms of a townhouse or the  villa  of a great city The present owner meditates the rebuilding of the old part and as he has already shewn such good judgment in a noble room in which simplicity is joined with grandeur there is little doubt but he will preserve a style of local propriety throughout the whole  THE present set of pictures belonging to the house are por∣traits of the families of  Wynn  and  Williams  Here is a very fine threequarters of the old Sir  John Wynn  of  Gwedir  in a high hat and with a vast white beard and in the dress of the times of  James  I I reserve further mention of him till I arrive at his antient seat  HIS son Sir  John Wynn  knight is drawn halflength a young man with whiskers and a peaked beard dark hair great flat ruff black vest white girdle stuck with points a white flowered baldric Sir  John  died on his travels at  Lucca  and was succeeded by his brother  Richard  A most exquisite head of Sir  Richard  by  Vandyck  is preserved here He was gentleman of the privychamber to  Charles  I when prince of  Wales  and attended him in the romantic journey he took into  Spain  in to visit his designed bride Sir  Richard  drew up an admirable account of his travels which is printed among other scarce tracts by Mr  Thomas Hearn  On the accession of  Charles  to the throne he was appointed treasurer to the queen  and dying without issue was succeeded by his brother  Owen  A HALFLENGTH of  Henry Wynn  Esq  another son of the old Sir  John  and representative of the county of  Merioneth  in the last parlement of  James  I He is painted in black hair a great  over and a letter in his hand Here is also a portrait of  brother a captain of a man of war in the same dress Both of them good performances  HERE are besides several more modern portraits such as of the two late dukes of  Beaufort  in their robes A composition with  Charles  duke of  Beaufort  leaning on the late Sir  Watkin  's shoulder looking at the horse legacy This figure of Sir  Wat∣kin  is the strongest resemblance of him of any  TWO portraits of the late

return to  Rhiwabon  I passed through the turnpike to∣wards  Wrexham  On the road I digressed a little to the left to visit a great  Caer  in this parish called the  Garthen  GARTHEN  i e  Caerddm  seated on the summit of a hill commanding a most extensive view a  urd of the fine and fertile country of  Maelor Gymraeg  or  Bromfield  and part of  Maelor Saesneg  or  English Maelor  mostly flat and wooded This  Caer  contains about four acres of ground protected in some parts by one in others with two very strong dikes and deep ditches The inner dike is made of loose stones with a wall of vast thickness on the top Within the area are many vestiges of buildings the habitations of the old possessors It lies between the  Offa  's and the  Wat  's dike Part of the turnpikeroad is formed for a considerable way along the top of the first which shews its prodigious thick∣ness  I PURSUED the tract of  Wat's dike  to  Erddig  ERDDIG  the elegant seat of  Philip Yorke  Esq  a place where nature has been lavish of beauties and improved by the excellent taste of the worthy owner Two little vales bound his lands watered by a pretty stream and bordered with hanging woods Along one side of the bank runs the dike and at the end between the two vales impending over them are small but strong entrenchments One surrounds a work of a pentagon form beyond which at the very verge is a mount that seems to have been a  dernier resort  to the garrison in case they had been beaten out of the former These compose what is called the  Roman fort  but there are neither coins or any thing else to confirm the conjecture of its having been one A fragment of wall cemented with mortar is all that remains of this castelet  WREXHAM lies at a small distance from this place  WREXHAM  This town is the largest in  North Wales  and the parish the most populous It appears by the antient name to have been of  Saxon  origin being called  Wrightesham  I can trace it no farther back than the time of the last earl  Warren  who had a grant of  it  Dugdale Baren  i  Leland  speaks of it as a place where there were some merchants and good bucklermakers  Itin  v  The parish is at this time noted for a manufactory of instruments of war but altered for those of offence instead of defence Near the place is a great foun∣dery for cannon under the direction of Mr  Wilkinson  who supplies many parts of  Europe  with this  ratio ultima regum  and in the late war between  Russians  and  Turks  furnished both parties with this species of logic  THE church of  Wrexham  is the glory  CHURCH  not only of the place but of  North Wales  being a magnificent pile erected in the time of  Henry  VII The date on the steeple is The inside of the church is very spacious and consists of a nave two ailes and a chancel Above the pillars is abundance of grotesque carv∣ing in ridicule of the regular clergy and the female religious abbesses and nuns and over the arches of the nave are many of the arms of the old  British  and  Saxon  princes  TOMBS  The tombs are numerous The most antient is of a knight all armed at his feet is a dog and beyond that a dragon whose tail ter∣minates in a serpent's head On his shield is a lion rampant Around is an inscription but all I could make out was  Hic jacet * * * * * * * * * * ap Howel  The letters are REH or R EVEHIRE  This had been dug up and is now reared against the steeple  THAT of  Hugh Bellot  vicar of  Gresford  and afterwards bishop of  Bangor  and of  Chester  is the next He lies in his robes re∣cumbent near the altar It was his request to be interred in the parish where he died His death happened at  Berse  near this  town in His funeral was celebrated at  Chester  and his body deposited here  ALMOST opposite to the prelate is a magnificent monument in memory of Mrs  Mary Middleton  daughter of Sir  Richard Middleton  of  Chirk castle  She died  April  th aged  She is represented rising out of her tomb in all the fulness of youth and beauty She died a very withered old woman but I like the thought of the sculptor allusive to the sublime passage in the burialservice  The irum∣pet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed  Above is a shattered pyramid and what might have been well excused the gross representation of the angelic beings founding the awakening call  IN a corner of one aile is a small but elegant monument of the Reverend Mr  Thomas Middleton  and his wife  Arabella Hacker  by  Roubiliac  Their faces are in profile on a medallion with a curtain lightly hanging on one

ornamented on three sides with rows of saints placed in rich gothic niches Among them is St  Giles  the patron saint of the church with the hind which miraculously nourished him in the desert At each corner is a light turret with a winding staircase twentyfour feet high the whole height of the steeple is a hundred and thirtyfive feet  Two casualties are recorded to have befallen this building The steeple was blown down on St  Catherine  's day and the church was burnt about the year In order to rebuild it an indulgence of forty days for five years was granted to every contributor to so pious a work  THE church is a vicarage formerly an impropriation belong∣ing to the abbey of  Valle Crucis  but on a dispute between  A  n  the second bishop of St  Asaph  was restored to the see  See the account of  Valle Crucis  in the further progress of this work  This great cure is assisted by two chapels  Minera  or  Mwyn glawdd  the  Mine upon the ditch  from that of  Offa  running by it this is

Chester  being the bequest of  Valentine Broughton  alderman of that city for the instruction of twelve boys  THE western part of this parish is hilly and mineral  MINES  Part of the mines on the waste are the property of lord  Grosvenour  and some belong to the corporation of  Chester Brombrough  another township on the heights produces coal In this place the inha∣bitants of  Holt  had by the charter granted to them in by  Thomas  earl of  Arundel  the liberty of digging for turf and coal The far greater part of the parish is either flat or composed of gentle risings extremely fertile and pleasant inhabited by a nu∣merous gentry who still preserve the character left of their pre∣decessors by honest  Churchyard  the simple swan of the reign of  Elizabeth  They are the joye and gladnesse

my road called at  Acton  ACTON  the seat of my good friend  Ellis Yonge  Esq  This place was formerly the property of the  Jefferies  a race that after running uncontaminated from an antient stock had the dis∣grace of producing in the last century  George Jefferies  CHANCELLOR JEFFERIES  chancellor of  England  a man of firstrate abilities in his profession but of a heart subservient to the worst of actions His portrait is a fine fulllength in the robes of his office painted by Sir  Godfrey Knel∣ler  Here is another fine fulllength of his brother Sir  Thomas  in a full wig and long cloak with the cross of some religious order    Charles  II sat to this great painter who survived to draw  George  I and to receive from him the dignity of baronet  Jef∣feries  was sixth son of  John Jefferies  and  Margaret  daughter to Sir  Thomas Ireland  of  Beausey  near  Warrington  Here is pre∣served a good portrait of the old gentleman in black sitting it was drawn in the d year of his age in  George  had the common school education of the country from which he was removed to that of  Westminster  He never had an academic edu∣cation but was placed immediately in the inner temple where he was chiefly supported by his grandmother  HE was never regularly called to the bar The accident of the plague in the neighborhood of  London  first introduced him into his profession for in he put on a lawgown and pleading at the  Kingston  assizes where few counsel chose to at∣tend he from that time acted without any notice being taken of his obtrusion About this time he made clandestine addresses to the daughter of a wealthy merchant in which he was assisted by a young lady the daughter of a clergyman The affair was discovered and the confidante turned out of doors  Jefferies  with a generosity unknown to him in his prosperous days took pity and married her She proved an excellent wife and lived to see him lord chief justice of  England  On her death he married the widow of Mr  Jones  of  Montgomeryshire  and daughter to Sir  Thomas Blodworth  HIS first preferment from the court was that of a  Welsh  judge In he was made chief justice of  Chester  After this he rose with great rapidity and as is well known fell as suddenly His conduct as chancellor was upright and able as a politi∣cian unrestrained by any principle devoted to the worst mea∣sures of an infatuated court He was extremely given to the bottle and paid so little respect to his character that one day having drank to excess with the lord treasurer and others they were going to strip and get upon a signpost to drink the king's health had not they been prevented  Reresby  's Memoirs  He died soon after his commitment either from harddrinking or a bro∣ken heart and so was preserved from the infamy of public execution  GRESFORD or  Croesffordd the road of the cross  GRESFORD  lies about two miles further The church is seated on the brow of a lofty eminence over a beautiful little valley whose end opens into the vast expanse of the vale royal of  Cheshire  and exhibits a view of uncommon elegance  CHURCH  The church is extremely handsome but less ornamented than that of  Wrexham  though built in the same reign On the top of the tower are images of the apostles On one side in a niche is another of  Henry  VII The neat re∣paration of the inside is owing to the direction and excel∣lent judgment of the reverend Mr  Newcome  the present vicar  HERE are two antient monuments one  TOMBS  much hid by a pew a flat stone with a shield and other sculpture The arms on the shield are three mullets on a bend These shew the de∣ceased to have been one of the later posterity of  Ithel ap Ednyfed  whose father had the townships of  Gresford  and  Allington  bestow∣ed on him for services done

a tablet concealing half his body It signifies that he died in  London  in  June  and that his son Sir  Richard  caused his bones to be removed to this place  SIR RICHARD erected his own monument in in the th year of his age representing himself in armour kneeling and his wife  Catherine  daughter of  Robert Puleston  Esq  of  Emral  by him The inscription informs us that it was chiefly in me∣mory of his lady that he caused this memorial to be erected  Salusbury  Pedigree iii  He served many years in the  Irish  wars was governor of  Newry  and the counties of  Down  and  Ardmagh  council of the marches and vice admiral of  North Wales  and lived as he tells us to see his children's children's children There is another mo∣nument to his lady who is placed kneeling with her five daughters  AT their neighboring seat of  Trevalyn  is a singular portrait of Sir  Richard  dressed in black Above hang his arms with the words  So then  beneath are some medicines and  Now thus  allu∣sive to his former and present state  A  the extremity of the lofty slope that impends over the plains and affords an almost boundless view to the north and northeast  THE ROFTS  is a peninsulated field called the  Rofts  that formed in old times a strong  British  post It is defended by three strong dikes and fosses cut across the narrow isthmus that connects it to higher parts of the parish On two sides it is inaccessible by reason of the steepness of the declivity and on the fourth which fronts  Cheshire  and is of easier ascent had been pro∣tected by two or three other ditches now almost levelled by the plough In one corner of this post is a vast exploratory mount This seems to have been an important station an outguard to our country against invaders which made an arti∣ficial elevation quite necessary in order to observe the motions of an enemy  IT lies I think in the manor of  Merford  which with that of  Horsley  was by act of parlement in the reign of  Henry  VIII  ng into the county of  Flint  but whether they extend to the  parish of  Hope  in  Flintshire  or are surrounded by  Denbighshire  I am uncertain  FROM hence I returned by the same road to my quarters at  Llangollen  IN the morning I took a ride to view the country that lies to the southwest The road lay on the same side of the river with the town I kept ascending a hill cloathed in many parts with birch From the summit was a most elegant view one way of the antient castle on its conic hill and the mural ranges of the  Glisseg  rocks in various tiers behind Beneath on the other side  LLANDYSILIO  lies the house of  Llandysilio  the seat of  Thomas Jones  Esq  in a pretty vale watered by the  Dee  that winds along the bottom after passing between two rocky promontories that barely

gives him incense of a far superior kind and I fear the poet's ardor to celebrate his patron carried him to the borders of blasphemy for in his  Cowydd y Seren  or  Poem of the star  he describes three that appeared to mark three great events for to the star which foretold the birth of our SAVIOUR he adds another which presaged that of  Arthur  and a third which marked the great deeds of  Glyndwr  in the meridian of his glory  Cowydd y Seren  a Ymddangoses mis mawrth B A    HE appears to have had a liberal education His ambition overcame the prejudices of his country against the  English  and determined him to seek preferment among them He entered himself in the inns of court and studied there till he became a barrister It is probable that he quitted his profession for we find that he was appointed  scutiger  or squire of the body to  Richard  II whose fortunes he followed to the last was taken with him in  Flint  castle and when the king's houshold was dis∣solved retired with full resentment of his sovereign's wrongs to his patrimony in  Wales  I judge that he was knighted before the deposal of his master for I find him among the witnesses in the celebrated cause between Sir  Richard le Scrope  and Sir  Ro∣  le Grosvenour  about a coat of arms under the title of Sir  de Glendore  His brother also appears there by the name of  Tudor de Glendore  This cause lasted three years and ended in  Collins  's Peerage vii    JOLO GOCH  HIS HOUSE  the celebrated poet of this period resided here for some time He came on a pressing invitation from  Owen  who knowing the mighty influence of this or∣der of men over the antient  Britons  made his house as  Jolo  says a sanctuary for bards He made them the instru∣ments of his future operations and to prepare the minds of the people against the time of his intended insurrec∣tion From  Jolo  I borrow the description of the seat of the chieftain when it was in full splendor He compares it in point of magnificence to  Westminster  abby and informs us that it had a gatehouse and was surrounded with a moat  THAT within were nine halls each furnished with a ward∣robe I imagine filled with the cloaths of his retainers accor∣ding to the custom of those days  NEAR the house on a verdant bank was a wooden house supported on posts and covered with tiles It contained four apartments each subdivided into two designed to lodge the guests  HERE was a church in form of a cross with several cha∣pels  THE seat was surrounded with every conveniency for good living and every support to hospitality a park warren and pigeonhouse a mill orchard and vineyard and fishpond filled with pike and gwyniads The last introduced from the lake at  Bala  A HERONRY which was a concomitant to the seat of every great man supplied him and his guests with game for the sport of falconry  A PLACE still remains that retains the name of his park It extends about a mile or two beyond the site of his house on the lefthand of the valley  THE vestiges of the house are small The moat is very ap∣parent the measurement of the area it inclosed is fortysix paces by twentysix There is the appearance of a wall on the outside which was continued to the top of a great mount on which stood the wooden house On the other side but at a greater distance I had passed by another mount of the same kind called  Hêndom  which probably might have had formerly a building similar to that described by the bard This per∣haps was the station of a guard to prevent surprize or insult from the  English  side He had much to apprehend from the neighboring fortress of  Dinas Brân  and its appendages possessed by the earl of  Arundel  a strenuous supporter of the house of  Lancaster  THE bard speaks feelingly of the wine the ale the braget and the white bread nor does he forget the kitchen nor the important officer the cook whose life when in the royal service was estimated by our laws at a hundred and twentysix cows  Leges Wallicae  Such was the hospitality of this house that the place of porter was useless nor were locks or bolts known To sum up all no one could be hungry or dry in  Sycharth  the name of the place  THE bard pays all due praise to the lady of the house and her offspring  A  Gwraig  orau o'r gwragedd  WIFE  Gwynn y myd o'i Gwin a'i medd  Merch eglur Llin marchawglyw  Urddol hael o reiol ryw

come in pairs  A beautiful nest of chieftains  THE lady whom he thus celebrates was  Margaret  daughter of Sir  David Hanmer  of  Hanmer  in the county of  Flint  one of the justices of the king's bench by appointment of  Richard  II in and knighted by him in  Collins  's Baronet ii p  Her nuptials were previous to her father's promotion for it is certain that some of the daughters were married and his sons grown to men's estate before  Glyndwr  appeared in arms in the year  CHILDREN  They followed him into the field and commanded under him It is probable that most of them fell gloriously in battle Mr  Brown Willis  indeed says that on their father's death they fled into  Ireland  that one of them settled in  Dublin  and took the name  of  Baulf  Hist of St  Asaph  Cathedral  or the strong and was ancestor to a reputable family in that city  HE matched his daughters into considerable families  HIS eldest  Isabel  to  Adam  or  Adda ap Jorwerth Ddu  HIS second  Elizabeth  or as some say  Alicia  was married to Sir  John Scudamore  of  Ewyas  and  HolmLacy  in the county of  Hereford  JONET to  John Crofts  of  Croft Castle  in the same county  LORD GREY of  Ruthyn  took through necessity  Jane  after he was made prisoner by her father who forced him into the alliance  HIS youngest daughter  Margaret  was married to  Roger Mon∣nington  of  Monnington  in the county of  Hereford  towards the borders of  Brecknockshire  The estate still continues in the name and family I have had the pleasure of seeing at my house two ladies owners of the place direct descendants from the daughter of  Glyndwr  HIS illegitimate issue were his son  Jevan  a daughter mar∣ried into the house of  Gwernan  another named  Myfanwy  to  Llewelyn ap Adda  of  Trefor  and  Gwenllian  to  Philip ap Rys  of St  Harmon  in  Radnorshire  LEWIS GLYN COTHI a bard of the time of  Henry  VI speaks in high terms of her father  Glyndwr  Ei  Thad oedd dwysawg eadarn  A holl  Gymru  fu'n ei farn  'Her father was a potent prince All  Wales  was in his council'  I MUST not omit notice of a mistake of the  English  historians who mention the marriage of another daughter of  Glyndwr  to  Edmund  earl of  March  This they assert was also effected by force after the earl became his prisoner but it does not appear that he ever was  Glyndwr  's captive or that  March  had any other wife than  Anne  † daughter to  Edmund  earl of  Stafford  besides the  Welsh  histories are totally silent on that head  SUCH was the state of the domestic affairs of  Glyndwr  at the change of government in His resentment against the usurper was whetted by wrongs public and private by the murder of the unhappy  Richard  to whom he was strongly attach∣ed by being a personal favorite and by the strong partiality the  Welsh  had for their late king  IN the very first year or the new reign he experienced the frowns of the court  OPPRESSED BY LORD GREY  Reginald  lord  Grey  of  Ruthyn  taking ad∣vantage of the deposal of  Richard  instantly seized on a certain common called  Croeseu  which  Glyndwr  in a former reign had recovered from him by course of law  Owen  fought justice without having recourse to violence he laid his case be∣fore parlement but his suit was dismissed without re∣dress  THIS insult was aggravated by another injury When  Henry  went on his expedition against the  Scots Owen  was to have been summoned among other barons to attend the king with his vassals The writ for that purpose was delivered to  Reginald  Visa Ricardi ii  who designedly neglected to deliver it till the time was nearly  elapsed and it became impossible for him to obey  Regineld  returned to the king and misrepresented the absence of  O  n  as an act of wilful disobedience and by this piece of treachery took possession of all his land and on this under pretence of forfeiture invaded such parts of  Glyndwr  's estates as lay adjacent to his own  THE danger of driving into desperate measures a person of his interest spirit and abilities was foreseen by  John Trevor  bishop of St  Asaph  who advised more temperate proceedings that  Owen  was by no means a despicable enemy and that the  W  lsh  would certainly be provoked into a general insurrection His advice was rejected and he was told there could be no fear about such a barefooted rabble  Leland's  Collect  i    IT does not appear that  Glyndwr  till this period had any settled design of flinging off the  English  yoke Ambition now came in and joined with his revenge  ASSERTS HIS CLAME TO WALES  He revolved in his mind his own genealogy he derived himself from the antient race of  British  princes and apparently laying aside all sense of private wrong made open clame to the throne of  Wales  To encou∣rage his countrymen strongly attached to the prophecies of an∣tient times he reminded them of those of  Merlin  and other sages His bards set before them the great qualities of their leader and taught them to expect from his valor and con∣duct the freedom of antient  Britons  from the galling weight of the  Saxon  yoke His chief bard  Gryffydd Llwyd  after regretting his absence chaunts his praise and predicts the  success of the war The  Cowydd  or poem begins thus in the original  Eryr digris afrised  OWAIN  c  THE reader will receive it agreeably paraphrased by a bard of    CAMBRIA'S princely

in arms in the summer of the year  APPEARS IN ARMS  He naturally directed his attack against the lands of his enemy lord  Grey  and immediately recovered what he had unjustly been dispossessed of during the absence of the former As soon as the news reached  Henry  he sent lord  Talbot  and lord  Grey  to reduce him They arrived with such speed that they surrounded his house before he had any notice but he had the good fortune to escape into the woods He immediately raised a powerful band of men and after causing himself to be proclamed prince of  Wales  on the th of  September  surprized plundered and burnt to the ground the town of  Ruthyn  BURNS RUTHYN  at the time a fair was held  there After which he retired to his fastnesses among the moun∣tains One I imagine to have been the great strength sur∣rounded by a vast rampart of stones near  Corwen  called  Caer Drewyn  HENRY  FIRST MARCH OF HENRY AGAINST HIM  determined to suppress this revolt in the beginning marched in person against  Owen  and penetrated as far as the isle of  Anglesea  putting to the sword all that resisted He plun∣dered the convent of  Llanvaes  Leland's  Collect  i  slew some of the monks and took the rest away with him at length set them at liberty and made restitution to the monastery but peopled it again with  English  religious The monks of  Llanvaes  had been  Franciscans  an order who were firm adherents to the late prince and who in general were suspected of promoting the insurrection of Glyn∣dwr and even of inviting him to invade  England  This occa∣sioned a persecution of them and several  Ibid  were executed on that account Their intelligence with  Glyndwr  is very evident from the favor he shewed the order on the taking of  Cardiff  in the year when he burnt the whole town excepting the street inhabited by the Franciscans  Idem    THE king returned without effecting any material action for on his approach  Owen  retired among the Snowdon hills  Holinshed    THE proclamation for assembling the forces for this expedi∣tion was dated on the th of  September  from  Northampton  and addressed to the lieutenants of  Warwickshire Leicester  and  eight other counties in which all persons capable of bearing arms within their jurisdiction were directed to array themselves and be ready to march to such place as his majesty directed who acquaints the lieutenants that he should lie at  Coventry  on his road to  Wales  the  Monday  following  Rymer  's Foedera viii    ON the same day he issued out an order to the bailifss and good people of  Shrewsbury  SHREWSBURY SE∣CURED BY HENRY  to take proper steps to secure that important place and that they oblige all the  Welsh  resident in the town to give security for their loyal behaviour and in case of refusal to commit them to prison  Idem    ON the eighth of  November  in the same year  WHO GRANTS OWEN'S ESTATES TO THE EARL OF SOMERSET  he made a grant of all the estates of  Glyndwr  in  North  and  South Wales  to his brother  John  earl of  Somerset  Idem  an act as weak as it was irri∣tating for  Owen  was so far from being in any danger of be∣ing dispossessed of them that at this very time he was growing more powerful by the accession of new forces It is remark∣able that his revenue in money at this period did not exceed three hundred marks which shewed that his rents in kind must have been very considerable  BUT the last public act of this year was conciliating  AND OZERRS PAR∣DON TO THE WELSH  The king made one endeavour to bring back the  Welsh  to their al∣legiance by fair means and for that end issued a proclamation on the th of  November  offering to take under his protec∣tion all that would resort to the city of  Chester  and there make their submission to his son  Henry  prince of  Wales  PRINCE HENRY FIRST APPEARS  after which they should be at liberty to return to their respective  homes  Rymer viii    Henry  was at that time but twelve years of age so early was he initiated into state affairs so early appeared those sparks of genius which shone afterwards with such bril∣liancy    THE first half of this year passed without any memorable action  OWEN AUGMENTS HIS FORCES  Owen  was busied in augmenting his forces he made considerable levies in  Wales  and received continual addition to his strength by the great resort of his countrymen of all orders who had gone into  England  for the sake of education or to gain a livelihood by different occupations  THE state of  Henry's  affairs  STATE OF HEN∣EY'S AFFAIRS AT THIS TIME  in respect to the  European  mo∣narchs the badness of his title to the crown of  England  and the repentance of several of the great men for their disloy∣alty to their late prince were circumstances highly in favor of  Glyndwr  CHARLES VI of  France  fatherinlaw to the unhappy  Rich∣ard  prepared to revenge his deposal and murder The confu∣sion of his own affairs luckily for  Henry  prevented the resent∣ment of the  French  monarch He contented himself with re∣ceiving back his daughter  Isabel  and her  paraphernalia  and  Henry  gladly renewed a truce with him for thirty years  THE  Scots  taking advantage of his situation threatened him with invasion This made it dangerous for him to engage in a distant war and obliged him to continue for a considerable time in the central parts of his dominion to act according to the ne∣cessity  of events In respect to the  Welsh  he contented himself with issuing out pardons  Rymer viii  at the instance of prince  Henry  to all that had appeared in arms in the counties of  Caernarvon Anglesey  and  Flint  and the people of  Denbigh  and  Merioneth  HENRY OFFERS NEW PARDONS  to the in∣habitants of  Chirkland Bromfield  and  Yale  to the hundred of  Oswestry  and to those of  Ellesmere  and  Whittington  which I find were then reckoned parts of  Wales Owen  himleif  Rice ap Tudor William ap Tudor  and all such as were in actual custody or such who should continue in arms were excepted The first pardon was given out the th of  May  the latest the th of  June  and as will appear with some effect  GLYNDWR's fortune and interest lay as was before mentioned both in  North  and in  South Wales  This summer he marched with a hundred and twenty men of arms and with great policy  OWEN POSTS HIM∣SELF ON PLIN∣LIMMON  posted himself on  Plinlimmon  hill a lofty mountain the limits of  Cardiganshire  and  Montgomeryshire  admirably adapted for receiving succours from his vassals and friends in each part of the princi∣pality From hence his followers made plundering excursions and were the terror of all that declined espousing his cause The county of  Montgomery  suffered greatly  PLUNDERS MONT∣GOMERY  He sacked the capital town  Leland Itin v  burnt the suburbs of  Pool  and ravaged all the borders He destroyed the abby of  Comhere  in  Radnorshire  took the castle of  Radnor  and caused the whole garrison to the number of three∣score  BEHEADS SIXTY MEN  to be beheaded on the brink of the castleyard  Ibid  The provocation to this piece of cruelty does not appear  THE  Flemings  inhabitants of  Ross Pembroke  and  Cardigan∣shire  suffered so greatly from  Glyndwr  that they determined to attempt to remove so troublesome a neighbour  SURPRISED  They assembled a body of fifteen hundred men and made so expeditious a march as to surround  Owen  and his forces at a place called  Mynydd Hyddgant  before he had any notice of their approach They hemmed him in on every side and notwithstanding he could make no retreat without great disadvantage he made a long and manful defence At length finding it impossible to subsist in that place he determined to cut a passage through the enemy or perish in the attempt  YET DEFEATS THE ENEMY  He knew that neither he nor his men were to expect any mercy so actuated by despair they fell furiously on the  Flemings  and after a strong dispute flung them into great disorder which  Owen  taking advantage of redoubled his attack and at length put them to night leaving two hundred of their party dead on the spot  THIS victory added greatly to the reputation of  Glyndwr  Mul∣titudes resorted to his standard and contributed to make him a most formidable enemy  HENRY alarmed at his successes marched a second time in per∣son  HENRY'S SECOND MARCH  He entered  Wales  with a great army about the beginning of  June  Vita  R  II  destroyed the abby of  Strathfleur  in  Cardiganshire  and ravaged the country but was obliged to make a disgraceful retreat after his forces had suffered greatly by famine and the great fatigues they continually underwent  THE monk of  Evesham  Vita R ii  relates an instance of paternal affec∣tion much to the honor of our country A  Welshman  having made a rash promise to the king to betray  Glyndwr  refused af∣terwards to perform it and eagerly stretching out his neck to the headsman told him to strike for that he had two sons at that time in the service of his chieftain therefore would on no account reveal his councils which would prove so penal to them  IT is probable  CORRUPTS SOME OF OWEN'S FRIENDS  that during this expedition  Henry  found means to corrupt the fidelity of several of the friends of  Glyndwr  for we find a free pardon granted to  William ap Tudor  a gentleman who had been excepted in the pardon of last year and to thirtyone principal persons of the country This is dated from  West∣minster  on the th of  July  Rymer viii    THIS defection seemed to have very little effect on the spirit of  Glyndwr  He acquired new friends and such addition of strength that the king resolved to go again in person against him He issued out his orders to the lieutenants of  Devonshire  and one and twenty other counties to repair with their forces to  Wor∣cester  Ibid  on the first of  October  Our old historians are silent about the event of this expedition but Mr  Carte  says that it was un∣fortunate as the former  MAKES A THIRD EXPEDITION  Thus concluded the transactions of this year    THIS year was ushered in with a comet  A COMET  or blazingstar which the bards interpreted as an omen favourable to the cause of  Glyn∣dwr  It served to infuse spirit into the minds of a superstitious  people the first success of their chieftain confirmed their belief and gave new vigor to their actions  LORD GREY was the first that felt the effects of  Owen's  power That nobleman strongly attached to  Henry  and impatient of the injuries which he and his friends received from  Glyndwr  raised a considerable army encountered him was defeated and made prisoner  OWEN DEFEATS LORD GREY  Historians differ about the scene of action The  Welsh  lay it on the banks of the  Fyrnwy  in the county of  Montgo∣mery  The  English  say that it was in the neighborhood of  Ru∣thyn  and that  Owen  advancing towards the castle with a party of men drew his incautious rival into the field where he fell into an ambush and was taken and carried fast bound into confinement amidst the savage fastnesses of the  Snowdon  hills  Vita  Ricardi  II  This relation seems probable not only as the castle of  Ruthyn  was the chief seat of lord  Grey  but a fortress of such strength as to baffle all attempts of  Glyndwr  in the infancy of his insur∣rection without having recourse to stratagem  LORD GREY remained for a long time in captivity  MAKES HIM PAY A GREAT RANSOM  nor did he gain his liberty till he paid to him the vast sum of ten thou∣sand marks He was such a personal favorite with the king who pitying the severity with which he was treated and ad∣miring the firmness with which he resisted the offers of  Glyndwr  to make him swerve from his loyalty that his majesty issued out a special commission dated the th of  October  in this year empowering Sir  William de Roos  Sir  Richard de Grey  Sir  William de Willughby  Sir  William de Zouch John Henry William Vans  John Lee John Longford Thomas Payne  and  John Elnstow  to treat with  Owen  and his council about the ransom It was agreed to pay six thousand marks on the day of St  Martin  Rymer viii  following and give as hostages for the payment of the remainder his eldest son and some other persons And in order to raise the money  Henry  gave licence to  Robert Braybrook  Dagdale's Baron i  bishop of  London  and two others feoffees of divers lordships for lord  Grey  to sell the lordship of  Herteleigh  in  Kent  He also absolved him for six years from the forfeiture of twothirds of the profits of his  Irish  estates usually exacted from such who were nonresident in that kingdom  AFTER this he was set at liberty and he and his tenants suf∣fered to enjoy their property without molestation It is probable that  Owen  engaged his lordship to observe a neutrality as another term of redemption Lord  Grey  seemed likewise to think it necessary to secure both his people and himself by an alliance with  Owen  for no sooner was he released than he married  Jane  AND MARRY ONE OF HIS DAUGH∣TERS  third daughter of the furious chieftain He had no issue by this lady The match was probably compulsive at best political Some of the  English  historians pretend that he died in captivity but that he obtained his liberty and long survived this treaty is evident for in he was ordered by  Henry  to his estates to repel the ravages his fatherinlaw made on the borders He even lived to serve in the  French  wars in the reign of  Henry  V and his successor and died in the year  Collins's Peerage ii    OWEN after securing this potent enemy began to give a free rein to his revenge to punish such of his countrymen whom he considered as traitors to the generous cause of freedom by an unnatural adherence to the  English  whose yoke they had borne for such a length of time  HE burnt the houses of  Kevn y fan  and  Cesailgyfarch  be∣longing to  Jevan ap Meredyth  a partizan of the house of  Lan∣caster  and to whom and  Meredyth ap Hwlkin Llwyd  of  Glynl  ivon  was intrusted under an  English  captain the castle of  Caernarvon  This place was so closely blocked up by the friends of  Glyndwr  that  Jevan  happening to die there at that time it was found ne∣cessary to carry his corpse by sea in order to inter it in the parish∣church of  Penmorva  on the other side of the county  Hist Gwedir    HOWEL SELE of  Nannau  in  Merionethshire  STORY OR HOWEL SELE  first cousin to  Owen  had a harder fate He likewise was an adherent to the house of  Lancaster Owen  and this chieftain had been long at variance I have been informed that the abbot of  Kymmer  near  Dolgellu  in hopes of reconciling them brought them together and to all appearance effected his charitable design While they were walk∣ing out  Owen  observed a doe feeding and told  Howel  who was reckoned the best archer of his days that there was a fine mark for him  Howel  bent his bow and pretending to aim at the doe suddenly turned and discharged the arrow full at the breast of  Glyndwr  who fortunately had armour beneath his cloaths so received no hurt Enraged at this treachery he seized on  Sole  burnt his house and hurried him away from the place nor could ever any one learn how he was disposed of till forty  years after the skeleton of a large man such as  Howel  was dis∣covered in the hollow of a great oak in which  Owen  was sup∣posed to have immured him in reward of his persidy The ruins of the old house are to be seen in  Nannau  park a mere compost of cinders and ashes  IT must be observed that when  Owen  was carrying him away his relation  Gryffydd ap Gwyn  of  Ganllwyd  in  Ardudwy  attempted his rescue but was defeated with the loss of numbers of his men and of his houses of  Berthlwyd  and  Cesn Coch  which were burnt to ashes  IT was about this period that  Owen  wreaked his revenge on the ecclesiastics who had favored the cause of the  English  BURNS ST AS  PH AND BANGOR  His conduct in this instance fe  rs indefensible for he paid no regard to the most sacred edifices but sacrilegiously destroyed the ca∣thedrals of  Bangor  and St  Asaph  with the episcopal palace and the canons houses belonging to the last He vented in a parti∣cular manner his resentment against the last as the bishop  John Trevor  received his preferment from  Richard  OF BISHOP TRE∣VOR  yet was so disloyal as to pronounce against his unfortunate master the sentence of deposition in favor of the usurping  Henry  and afterwards to accept an embassy to the court of  Spain  to justify  Bolingbroke  's proceedings to the reigning prince  HENRY considered him as a sufferer in his cause therefore gave power to the bishops of  Hereford Voltorno  and  Bangor  to suffer him to hold in  commendam  the living of  Meivod  with the chapels of  Pool  and  Kegidva  or  Guilsfield  in order to support his dignity during the ravage of his diocese  Rymer  viii the bishop of  Voltorno  probably acted as the pope's legate    TREVOR returned to  England  about the time of the destruction of his cathedral Two years after this he revolted from  Henry  and joined with  Glyndwr  to whom he adhered the rest of his days He appeared in arms with him in the year  Rymer viii  In the year following on the decline of  Owen  's affairs he retired to  Paris  died and was buried in the chapel of the infirmary of the abby  de St Victoire  there and the following epitaph inscribed to his memory Hic jacet Reverendus in CHRISTO Pater  Jobannes  Episcopus  Asaphensis  in  Wallia  qui obiit A D Die Veneris x mensis  Aprilis  cujus anima feliciter requieseat in pace  Amen  GLYNDWR was pleased to confirm  Trevor  in his see  OWEN CONFIRMS HIM IN HIS SEE  on return∣ing to his allegiance but deposed from that of  Bangor  Willi  's Bangor  Richard Younge  AND DEPOSES THE BISHOP OF BAN∣GOR  for his adherence to the usurper and kept him in close confinement  Owen  also appointed in his room  Llewelyn  or as some call him  Lewis Bifort  whose name is mentioned in among the chief of the inhabitants fined or outlawed on account of  Glyndwr  's insurrection in the isle of  Anglesey  He afterwards joined with the earl of  Northumberland  and lord  Bardolph  and was taken prisoner in the castle of  Bramham Moor  in  February  when those two noblemen were slain but the bishop's life was spared as he was found unarmed  Goodwin    HENRY was alarmed at the successes of  Glyndwr  and resolved to march in person against him once more He issued out w  ts  Rymer viii  to the lieutenants of  Nottingham  and  Derby  and to those of thirty two other counties dated from the castle of  B    June  th in which he requires them to assemble the forces of their respective jurisdictions and to attend him at  Lichfield  on the th of  July  in order to suppress this dangerous revolt  BEFORE the king could assemble his forces news arrived of the great victory which  Glyndwr  obtained on the d of  June  GAINS A GREAT VICTORY AT PIL∣LETH  over Sir  Edmund Mortimer Owen  after the defeat of lord  Grey  pursued his resentment against all the chieftains unfavorable to his de∣signs advanced with his army towards  Herefordshire  and the borders of  South Wales  and carried fire and sword through the lands of his opponents None suffered so severely as the vassals and tenants of  Edward Mortimer  earl of  March  a child of ten years of age who with his brother  Roger  was in the custody of the king at that time  Henry  was very sensible of the just title this child had to the crown being desended from  Lionel  duke of  Clarence  third son to  Edward  III His title had even been acknowleged in parlement This increased his majesty's apprehensions and made him consider the misfortunes of that family the strengthening of his own throne  SIR EDMUND MORTIMER uncle to this youth unable any longer to bear the depredations of  Owen  collected a large body of his nephew's tenants and retainers out of the county of  Here∣ford  and the adjacent parts particularly from  Melienydd  in  Radnorshire  and with these marched against the invader A bloody action ensued on  Brynglas  a mountain near  Pilleth  a little southwest of  Knighton  in  Radnorshire  Victory de∣clared in favor of our countryman Some writers assert that the archers of  Mortimer  's army bent their bows against their own party  Stow  Another says  Vita  Ricardi  II  that  March  's  Welsh  tenants took  to flight at the first onset and occasioned the defeat The loss chiefly fell on the people of  Herefordshire  Eleven hundred fell on the side of  Mortimer  The shamefull villanie used by the  Welshwomen  towards the dead carcasses  says  Holinshed  was such as honest eares would be ashamed to heare and continent toongs to speak thereof The dead bodies might not be bu∣ried without great summes of monie given for libertie to con∣veie them awaie  Holinshed  who relates it from  Walsingham  Those who wish to read the horrid tale may consult the last p  Camdeni Script Angl    SHAKESPEAR flings a fine horror over this dreadful tale in relating  When all athwart there came  A post from  Wales  loaden with heavy news  Whose worst was that the noble  Mortimir  Leading the men of  Herefordshire  to fight  Against the irregular and wild  Glendower  Was by the rude hands of that  Welshman  taken  A thousand of his people butchered  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse  Sach beastly shameless transformation  By those  Welshwomen  done as may not be  Without much shame retold or spoken of  I WISH I could exculpate my countrywomen from this heavy charge It originates from  Thomas de Walsmgham  an historian who it must be confessed wrote within forty years of this event To his authority I beg leave to oppose that of another antient writer who ascribes these barbarities to a follower of  Glyndwr  one  Rees a Gyrch  Vita  Ricardi    I flatter myself that this was the case for had it been otherwise it would have been totally unnecessary to discourage the  English  by an express law  Statute th  Henry  IV c  from marrying with such furies as the  Welshwomen  were represented to have been  MANY historians pretend that the young earl of  March  was present at this defeat was made prisoner and to ensure his allegiance obliged to marry a daughter of  Glyndwr  But at this time he endured another species of confinement at  Windsor  his uncle commanded the forces of the family  TAKES PRISONER SIR EDMUND MORTIMER  and lost his liberty in the battle Great instances were made to  Henry  for leave to ransom him but the jealous king rejoicing in the misfortunes of this rival house suffered him to continue in the power of his enemy alleging that Sir  Edmund  had treacher∣ously flung himself into the hands of  Glyndwr  AFTER this victory  Glyndwr  received from all parts of  Wales  accession of strength Notwithstanding  Henry  was indifferent about the fate of the  Mortimers  his own safety now required him to act with vigor The design of assembling his army at  Lichfield  was laid aside New writs were issued out dated the st of  July  It was resolved to distract the  Welsh  by three in∣vasions from different quarters The rendevous of the first army was to be at  Shrewshury  to be commanded by the king in person the second at  Hereford  to be assembled by  Edmund  earl of  Stafford Richard  earl of  Warwick  and the lords  Grey Alergavenny Audeley  and  Berkly  and the third under the con∣duct  of prince  Henry  at  Chester  The forces were to be assem∣bled at each place by the th of  August  Rymer viii    OWEN assured that these preparations could not take effect till a certain time gave loose to his resentment in the beginning of  August  against the inhabitants of  Glamorganshire  who had sided with the  English  RAVAGES GLA∣MORGANSHIRE  He marched into that county ravaged it on all parts and after burning the bishop's castle and the arch∣deacon's house  Willis's Llandaff  at  Llandaff  in the same inroad he likewise burnt  Cardiff  and  Abergavenny  and then returned to make head against the  English  THE  Scots  at this time took advantage of the commotions of the  Welsh  and under the command of the great  Douglas  invaded  England  with a body of twelve or thirteen thousand men It is almost certain that they acted in concert with  Glyndwr  Both nations were united in a common hatred of the  English  Both had felt the weight of their power The  Scots meditated  their inroad at the very time that  Henry  had drawn his forces to the borders of  Wales  and as they hoped left the northern bor∣ders unguarded  Henry  had intelligence that it was to take place on the assumption of the blessed Virgin or the th of  August  and in order to defeat it directed the lieutenant of the county of  Lincoln  to hasten towards the north with all the men he could raise  HENRY  HENRY'S FOURTH MARCH  during this time proceeded on his expedition against the  Welsh  It does not appear whether the army under his son and that under the earl of  Arundel  on whom the command of the  second army was bestowed made separate diversions into differ∣ent parts of the country in his favor or whether he united their forces with his own The event of his invasion was very unfor∣tunate  Glyndwr  who had too much prudence to hazard a battle against so superior an army retired to the fastnesses of the mountains and drove away the cattle and destroyed every means the  English  had of subsistence The season proved uncommonly bad for the very elements seem to have warred against them  UNSUCCESSFUL  A continued course of storms and rains with the continual watching against an enemy ever hovering over them and ready to take every occasion of falling on them from the heights wasted the army with sickness and fatigue and obliged the king once more to make a most inglorious retreat  THE  English  OWEN REPUTED A MAGICIAN  willing to cover their shame attributed the cause of their disgrace to the incantations of the  British  chieftain 'who' as an old historian expresses  through art magike as was thought caused such foule weather of winds tempest raine snow and haile to be raised for the annoiance of the king's armie that the like had not beene heard of  Perhaps  Glyndwr  as well to infuse terror into his foes as to give his people a more exalted notion of him might politically insi∣nuate his skill in spells and charms that they might suppose him aided by more than mortal power This species of credu∣lity was not only strong at this time but even continued to more enlightened days  OWEN by the mouth of  Shakespear  speaks thus of his in∣tercourse with the tribe of spints and of his skill in the mystic arts of divination  Where is he living clipt in with the sea  That chides the banks of  England Wales  or  Scotland  Who calls me pupil or has read to me  And bring him out that is but woman's son  Can trace me in the tedious ways of art  Or hold me pace in deep experiments  I can call spirits from the vasty deep  THE poet on this occasion plays finely with the warmth of  Glyndwr  and draws from him that characteristic spirit of our country which is nobly prompt to rise on the appearance or sometimes even on the very apprehension of insult  HENRY quickly received news from the north that served to alleviate the ill success of his invasion The earl of  Northum∣berland  and other northern barons had assembled their forces to oppose the  Scots  then on their return home overtook them on  Holyrood  day or the th of  September  BATTLE OF HO∣MELDON  on  Homeldon  hill near  Wooler  and gained over them a complete victory Numbers of the  Scotch  nobility were slain in the fight and numbers taken among whom was their gallant commander  Archibald  earl or  Douglas  styled by his countrymen  Tyneman  from the loss of men that attended him in all his conflicts  THIS battle was productive of great events and proved in the end the destruction of the  Percy  family It was usual for the prisoners to fall to the share of the victors and that each person who was fortunate or brave enough to make a captive should receive the reward of his valor by having liberty to ran∣som him according to his rank or abilities  ITS CONSE∣QUENCES  Henry Percy  sur∣named  Hotspur  had himself by the fortune of war been made  prisoner by the  Scots  and was redeemed according to the antient custom of arms The victors at this time expected and clamed the same right but  Henry  wishing to detain as hostages for the peaceable conduct of the  Scottish  nation these illustrious captives sent directions to the earl of  Northumberland  that he should by no means set them at liberty but that he should deliver them to him  Henry  softened this demand by rewarding  Northumber∣land  with a considerable grant of lands on the borders of  Scot∣land  Rymer viii  and parlement even sent him a letter of thanks for his good services  THE PERCIES DIS∣CONTENTED  Notwithstanding this the  Percies  were greatly dissatisfied Whether their high spirit resented the invasion of the antient title of victors to their prisoners or whether they were seized with remorse for their disloyalty to their former master or whether they were actuated by the ambition of be∣coming independent or whether all these causes might not co∣operate is not very certain yet from this time they formed their design of flinging off their allegiance to  Henry  A GREAT discontent with his government at this period began to seize the nation The affection for the murdered  Richard  revived So willing were the people to imagine him still alive that the many reports invented on that subject were greedily swallowed and a proneness to revolt almost generally ap∣peared  THE first step taken by the  Percies  was the release of the  Scottish  prisoners without ransom  RELEASE THEIR PRISONERS  This gained the heart of  Douglas  who went home raised a body of men and joined in the enterprize  SIR EDMUND MORTIMER  GLYNDWR SETS MORTIMER AT LIBERTY  from the time of his defeat was treated with the utmost humanity and respect  Glyndwr  politi∣cally determined to make use of this important prisoner as an instrument of his ambition reminded him of the right of his house to the crown of  England  and flattered him with the hopes of restoring it to the throne  Vita  Ricardi  II  of his ancestors The  Percies  to whom he was allied had made frequent instances to  Henry  for his ransom who on false and injurious pretences constantly refused attention to their request notwithstanding he never rested till he had procured the enlargement of his favorite lord  Grey  THE  Percies  now began to extend their views and to form a confederacy that promised fair to effect another revolution They entered into an alliance with  Glyndwr  obtained the release of  Mortimer  and like the famous triumvirate of  Rome  deter∣mined to divide the empire between them  THEIR place of meeting  CONSPIRACY OF THE PERCIES  the  Mutina  of these heroes was at the house of  David Daron  or of  Aberdaron  dean of  Bangor  Willis's Bangor  son of  Evan ap Dafydd ap Gryffydd  descended from  Caradoc ap Jestyn  a prince of  Wales  He was a man of interest and wealth entered strongly into their views and in consequence in the year was outlawed for his attachment to them  HERE the three chieftains formed the division of  Britain  UNITE WITH GLYNDWR  Sir Edmund Mortimer  in behalf of his nephew the earl of  March  took all the country from the  Trent  and  Seven  to the eastern and southern limits of the island  Northumberland  was to have all the  counties north of the  Trent  and  Glyndwr  every thing that lay beyond the  Severn  westward  IT was on this occasion that  Owen  to animate his country∣men called up the antient prophecy which predicted the de∣struction of  Henry  under the name of the  Moldwarp cursed of  GOD'S  own mouth  Himself he styled the  dragon  a name he assumed in imitatation of  Uther  whose victories over the  Saxons  were foretold by the appearance of a star with a dragon beneath which  Uther  used as his badge and on that account it became a favorite one with the  Welsh  On  Percy  he bestowed the title of  lion  from the crest of the family on  Mortimer  that of the  wolf  probably from a similar reason And these three were to divide the realm between them  GLYNDWR was now in the meridian of his glory  CONCENTION OF THE ESTATES OF WALES  He assem∣bled the estates of  Wales  at  Machynlleth  a town of  Montgomery∣shire  he caused there his title to the principality to be acknow∣leged and was formally crowned  AT this meeting he narrowly escaped assassination  DAVID GAM CON∣SPIRES AGAINST OWEN  Among the chieftains who appeared to support his title came a gentleman of  Brecknockshire David Gam  or the oneeyed a man says Mr  Carte  ii  who held his estate of the honor of  Hereford  who had long been in the service of  Bolingbrook  and was firmly at∣tached to his interest Notwithstanding he had married a sister of  Glyndwr  yet such a furious hatred had he conceived to his cause that he appeared at the assembly with the secret and treacherous resolution of murdering his prince and brotherinlaw  Carte  says that he was instigated to it by  Henry  but gives no authority for his assertion Partyzeal or hopes of reward probably determined him to so nefarious a deed He was a fit instrument for the purpose a man of unshaken cou∣rage which was afterwards put to the proof in the following reign at the battle of  Azincourt  This was the gentleman who was sent to explore the numbers of the enemy before the action and who informed the king that there were  enough to kill enough to be taken prisoners and enough to run away  In the battle  David  his soninlaw  Roger Vychan  and his relation  Waltar Llwyd  rescued the king when environed with his foes They saved his life at the expence of their own and fell with many mortal wounds The king after the victory ap∣proached the place where they lay weltering in their blood and in the moment of death bestowed on them the only reward of their valor which he could confer in that sad time the ho∣nor of knighthood  BUT to return to the subject immediately under consideration  DETECTED  The plot of  David  against  Glyndwr  was discovered He was arrested and imprisoned and would have met with his merited punishment if he had not been saved by the intercession of  Owen  's best friends and warmest partizans  Wynne's  Hist  Wales  He was pardoned on a solemn promise of attachment to the cause of  Glyndwr  and his country It appears that our chieftain did not chuse to rely on his promise but kept him in close confinement till the year as will appear in the transaction of that period  GLYNDWR as usual wreaked his vengeance on the lands and dependents of  Dafydd Gam  entered his country and burnt his house and while it was burning calling one of  David  's tenants spoke thus merrily to him in verse which shews the general turn of our people to the rhyming art  O gweli di wr coch Cam  Yn ymofyn y Gyrnigwen  Dywed ei bod hi tan y lan  A nôd y glo ar ei phen    PREPARATIONS were made with great vigor by all parties  HOTSPUR MARCH∣ES TO SHREWSBU∣RY  Hotspur  leaving his father ill at  Berwick  marched with his forces from the north and passing through  Cheshire  a county ever affectionate to  Richard  was joined there by a numerous party  Percy  sent to  Owen  to desire he would meet him but our countryman declined to comply howsoever numbers of the  Welsh  joined  Hotspur  and marched with him to  Lichfield  carry∣ing the stag the badge of the late king as a party distinc∣tion In that city he published his reasons for taking arms against  Henry  whom the family had so lately placed on the throne  Leland  Collect ii  From hence he led his army towards  Shrewshury  probably because he found himself too weak to attack the usurper for it seems as if his intention had been to have met him on his march had  Glyndwr  joined him with his whole force  Glyndwr  on the other hand had formed a considerable  army in  Wales  and Sir  Edmund Mortimer  had raised the vassals of his nephew  IN the month of  March Henry  gave a strong proof of the high opinion he had of his son  Henry  of  Monmouth  afterwards king of  England  at this time only fifteen years of age for by writ dated from  Westminster  the th of that month he appoints him his lieutenant for  Wales  Rymer viii  and all the adjacent counties with full powers to raise men and to act against the insurgents as he should think proper to enquire into all treasons to ex∣amine who supplied the rebels with arms or provisions and to grant pardon to all who would lay down their arms and give security for their peaceful behaviour  HAVING thus provided as he imagined for the security of the borders of  England  on the side of  Wales  he began to consi∣der of his march against the  Percies  But hearing that  Glyn∣dwr  Idem  by reason of want of provisions was preparing to make an inroad into the borders issued orders from  Westminster  dated  June  th to the lieutenant of  Gloucestershire  Idem  to prepare to repel the invasion with forces he should assemble for that purpose  Henry  then made a most expeditious march to  Burton  upon  Trent  where we find him on the th on his way against the northern rebels  Rymer    HENRY GOES TO MEET HIM  Here he understood that  Percy  with his army had advanced towards  Shrewshury  and was preparing to effect a junction with the forces of  Glyndwr  and  Mortimer  He well knew the importance of preventing it from taking place  and directed his  march  towards that town as is said by the advice of the earl of  Dunbar  a  Scottish  nobleman who had espoused his cause The dispatch with which the king executed this resolu∣tion saved his crown  Glyndwr  who had assembled his forces at  Oswestry  had sent off only his first division amounting to four thousand men who behaved with spirit in the day of ac∣tion  Holinshed  in which fell his brotherinlaw Sir  Jenkin Hanmer  Collins's Baronets ii ed    Henry  prevented him from proceeding with the rest by posting himself between  Glyndwr  and  Shrewsbury  and at the critical time that the northern rebels were about to scale the walls  Percy  quitted the attempt and after rejecting the offer of peace attacked the royal army at  Battlefield  three miles from the place  PERCY DEFBATED AND SLAIN  He behaved with the spirit worthy of his name fell valiantly and with him the hopes of his party This action happened on the st of  June Glyndwr  had the mortification of being obliged to remain all the time inactive at the head of twelve thousand men at  Oswestry  GLYNDWR CON∣TINUES AT OS∣WESTRY  The  Welsh  historians pass an unjust censure on him for his conduct on this occasion and blame him for what it seems he could not effect His great oversight appears to me to have been the neglect of attacking  Henry  immediately after the battle when the royal forces had sustained a vast loss and were overcome with fatigue when his own followers and the remains of the northern troops would have formed an army nearly double to that of the king when  Northumberland  now recovered from his illness was in full march towards him the army of  Mortimer  entire that of the king  constrained to go northward  Glyndwr  carried on a marauding war and plundered the now defenceless marches The king returned successful from the north to the borders of  Wales  de∣termined to chastise the insurgents but was obliged to desist from his enterprize for want of money to pay his troops and provisions to subsist them He did propose to remedy the first by seizing on the superfluous wealth of the prelates but was prevented by the spirit of the archbishop of  Canterbury  who boldly declared that none of his province should be spoiled on any account which frustrated  Henry  's intent on  Glyndwr  The prelate was afterwards better advised and made a grant of the tenth towards the king's necessary charges  Helinshed  NOTHING more was done this year than the securing the  Welsh  castles  HANRY SECURES THE WELEN CAS∣TLES  and placing over them persons of known fidelity The king dates his writ from  Worcester  the th of  September  and addressing it to  Guy Mohun  bishop of St  David  at that time keeper of the privyseal and treasurer of  England  commits to him the custody of the castle of  Llangadyn  that of  Llanyndovery  to  John Touchet  lord  Audley Laghern  to Sir  Henry le Scrope Crickhowel  to  John Pauncefort Tretour  to

THE last public act relating to the insurrections of die marches was to empower the prince of  Wales  to treat with certain  Cheshire  Idem  gentlemen about their fines for appearing in arms in the battle of  Shrowshury  ON the th and th of the same month he gives power to  William Beauchamp  to pardon certain of the vassals on his lands of  Abergavenny  and  Ewyas Harald  who had appeared in arms in behalf of  Glyndwr  and to the famous Sir  John Oldcastle John ap Henry  and  John Fairsord  clerk to pardon the inhabitants of  Brecknock Built Cancresselly Hay Glynbough  and  Dynas  to re∣ceive their weapons and to oblige them to take an oath of fide∣lity In this the king only secures their persons but reserves to himself their forfeited lands goods and chattels The first is dated from  Hereford  the other from  Devenok  Idem Idem      NOTWITHSTANDING the  French  king had consented  CONDUCT OF THE FRENCH  through the necessity of his own affairs to a truce of thirty years with  Henry  yet he never could be brought to acknowlege his title to the crown In his treaties  Charles  styles him only  notre cousin d'Angleterre  Idem  or  Henry  of  Lancaster  or our adversary of  England  or the successor of the late king  Richard  Carte ii  There is all the ap∣pearance of a correspondence between  Charles  and the  English  and  Welsh  insurgents in the last year and that the expedition to∣wards  Shrewshury  and an invasion of  England  by the  French  were concerted to distract the attention of  Henry  Their fleets hovered over our coasts under other pretences They even landed in the isle of  Wight  and did considerable damage to the country  AN open war was daily expected with  France  The parlement took the safety of the king's person into consideration His houshold was regulated and in particular it was ordered that no  Frenchman  or  Welshman  should remain about his majesty's person  Parliamentary Hist ii    THE wisdom of this provision soon became very apparent  GLYNDWR SENDS EMBASSADORS TO CHARLES VII  A league offensive and defensive was formed between  Charles  and  Owen Owen  sent his chancellor  Griffith Yonge  doctor of laws and his kinsman  John Hanmer  embassadors to the  French  Their appointment is dated from  Dolgellu  in a princely style  Datum apud  Doleguelii  die mensis  Maii MCCCC  quarto et princi∣palus nostri quarto

 were  James Bourbon  earl of  March  and  John  bishop of  Carnot  LEAGUE CON∣CLUDED BETWEEN THEM  Owen  's ambassadors signed their part on the th of  July  in the house of  Ferdinand de Corbey  chancellor of  France  several prelates and persons of high rank attending as  witnesses  Rymer viii    Glyndwr  ratified this treaty on the th  of  from his castle of  Lampadarn  Idem    THE affairs of  Glyndwr  bore so prosperous an aspect that about this time  Trovor  bishop of  St Asaph  revolted from  Henry  and joined with his countryman whether actuated by remorse for his dealings with his old master or tempted by the hopes of preferment under a new government is not evident  OWEN opened the campaign of this year with vigor He laid waste the country of his enemies took several castles  GLYNDWR RE∣TEATS BEFORE THE ENGLISH  among others those of  Harlech  and  Aherystwyth  Some he dis∣mantled and others he reserved and garrisoned He then di∣rected his march into  Montgomeryshire  and fell in with an  English  army at  Mynydd cwm du  They attacked him slew many of his men and obliged him to retreat He soon repaired this dis∣grace for collecting his forces again he pursued the victors with such expedition  DEFEATS THEM  that he overtook them at a place called  Craig y Dorth  near  Monmouth  defeated and pursued them to the very gates of every town or castle they had fled to  THE  English  historians mention the defeat of  Glyndwr  They inform us that the  English  army was commanded by  Richard Beauchamp  earl of  Warwick  who took the banner of  Glyndwr  Dugdale's Baron i  but are silent in respect of the revenge that so immediately fol∣lowed The king undertook nothing this year against  Glyndwr Beauchamp  had large possessions in the county of  Monmouth  and found it requisite to raise his vassals to preserve his country from desolation    THIS year opened with an attempt of a very extraordinary nature nothing less than to free from their confinement the young earl of  March  and his brother  ATTEMPTS TO STEAL AWAY THE EARE OF MARCH  with the intent of setting up the title of the first first that of  Henry  and to involve the whole kingdom in his quarrel There were many engaged in the design  Wales  was to have been his asylum and  Glyndwr  his pro∣tector such deep intelligence had he with the dissaffected even near the seat of the court  March  was kept in close custody at  Windsor  a royal residence amidst guards and secured by every precaution that a jealous usurper could invent Notwithstanding a plot was laid  Constance  lady  Spencer  widow

brought back The lady was imprisoned A severer fate at∣tended the poor smith that made the keys who was beheaded after having both his hands chopped off  Holinshed    FORTUNE now began to frown upon  Glyndwr  The first experience he had of her mutability was on the th of  March  BATTLE OF USKE  a body of his partizans to the amount of eight thou∣sand had assembled out of  Glamorganshire Uske Netherwent  and  Overwent  As usual they began their march with desolat∣ing the country and burnt part of the town of  Grosmont  in the county of  Monmouth Henry  prince of  Wales  was at that time at  Heresord  with the army entrusted to him by his father  ready to open the campaign He there received an account of the defeat of these malecontents by a handful of men commanded by Sir  Gilbert Talbot  joined by Sir  William Newport  and Sir  John Greindre  He transmitted the account to his father in a letter written in an uncommon strain of piety and dutifulness contra∣dictory to the popular opinion of his early licentiousness for at that time he was only seventeen years of age He begins with imploring Heaven for its favor towards his father  Je supplie vraiement que  DIEU  vous montre graciousment pour vous son miracle on toutes parties loez soit il en toutes ses ocuresIl est bien voirs que la victoire n'est pas en le multitude de people mes en la puissance de  DIEU  IT seems that the  Welsh  forgot the antient spirit of their coun∣try and yielded an easy victory to the enemy Eight hundred or a thousand were stain No quarter was given on the occa∣sion except to one

They probably were reinforced by the fugitives from the last action  OF PWLL MELYN  Another battle was fought on the fifteenth of the same month at  Mynydd y Pwll Melyn  in  Brecknockshire  again fatal to the cause of  Owen  Fifteen hun∣dred  of his men were slain or taken prisoners among the last was his son among the first his brother  Tudor  who resembled  Glyndwr  so greatly that a report was spread of his death to the great dejection of his countrymen but on examining the dead body it was found to want a wart over the eye which dis∣tinguished our chieftain from his brother According to  Carte  ii  young  Henry  commanded at this battle  HOLINSHED    mentions another defeat which the  Welsh  sus∣tained in the month of  May  in which  Gryffydd Yonge Owen'  's chancellor was made prisoner I suspect that the historian con∣founds this action with that near  Grosmont  but that the chan∣cellor was the great chieftain there made prisoner must be a mistake for we find him witness the next year to a pardon granted by  Owen  to one  Jeven Gôch  AFTER these defeats all  Glamorganshire  submitted to the king a few faithful friends only excepted who on discovering that  Owen  was alive fled and joined him It was at this time that he suffered those distresses which the  English  attribute to the latter part of his life During this dispersion of his friends he was obliged to seek protection from a few trusty partizans and often to conceal himself in caves and desert places A cavern near the seaside in the parish of  Llangelynin  in the county of  Merioneth  is still called  Ogof Owain  in which he was secretly supported by  Ednyfed ap Aaron  of the tribe of  Ednowain ap Bradwen  THE bard  Jolo Gôch  deplores his absence and calls him home from different parts of the globe to repossess himself of  his principality He in one place supposes him to be at  Rome  and entreats him to return laden with tokens from St  Peter  ABOUT this time the earl of  Northumberland  began another conspiracy which was detected and several of his adherents were executed Among others one Sir  John Griffith  a  Welsh  knight which makes it probable that the earl and  Glyndwr  still acted in concert The king by his activity quickly frus∣trated this plot seized on the earl's castles and obliged him to fly into  Scotland  for protection With him fled the bishops of St  Asaph  and  Bangor  Ferdun Scotichronicon ii  and the abbot of  Welbeck  The two first were probably placed by  Glyndwr  about the earl to consult the proper measures for the successful execution of their designs  HENRY then returned  HENRY MARCHRS AGAIN INTO WALES  and marched into  Wales  with an army of men The same illfortune attended him in this as in former expeditions The weather proved so bad that he was obliged to make a hasty retreat to  Worcester  aggravated with the loss of fifty of his carriages  Walsingham    Shakespear  makes our chieftain thus vaunt the frequent defeats of

 observes seems to have been intended to coincide with the insurrection of  Scroope  archbishop of  York  and other noblemen in the north Their attempt proved fatal to them But the sleet consisting of a hundred and forty ships sailed from  Brest  the latter end of  June  with an army of twelve thousand  According to the historian of this reign  Mademoiselle de Lassan  Ibid  there were among them eight hundred men at arms six hundred crossbows and twelve hundred footsoldiers all chosen troops  OUR historians say that they were commanded by the  Mare∣chal de Montmorency  but I cannot discover that any of that great houss was engaged in the expedition The fleet was under the command of  Renaud de Trie  lord of  Serisontaine  admiral of  France  the land forces under that of  Jean de Rieux  lord of  Rieux  and  Rochsort Marshal  of  France  Under him served  Jean  or as  Moreri  calls him  Aubert de Hangest Sire de Hugueville  master or the crossbows and who by reason of the age and infirmi∣ties  of  Ricux  seems to have been the acting general According to the genius of the nation the officers made the most bril∣liant appearance and  Hugueville  actually sold to the church of  Paris  his fine estate of  Agencourt  near  Mondidier  in order to furnish himself with a magnificent equipage  Histoire et regne de  Charles  VI tom iv    THE sleet had a very favorable passage but by neglect of pro∣viding sufficient quantity of fresh water most of the horses pe∣rished  LANDIN WALES  According to the best authority  Rymer  viii  the forces landed under the command of  Hugueville  in  Milsord Haven  He im∣mediately marched towards  Caermarthen  which he besieged and look by capitulation The garrison were suffered to depart and had liberty to take their effects with them  Walsingham    HE declined making any attempt on  Pembroke  by reason of the strength of the castle but sat down before  Haversordwest  where the earl of  Arundel  made so gallant a defence that the  French  were obliged to raise the siege with considerable loss  Glyndwr  had by this time reached  Tenbigh  with ten thousand men where he was joined by  Hugueville  As soon as the neces∣sary preparations were finished they marched through  Glamor∣ganshire  reached  Worcester  and burnt the suburbs and ravaged the country round  Monstrelet    As soon as  Henry  heard of the intended invasion he issued out a proclamation  Rymer viii  dated from  Westminster July  d in which he directs the lieutenants of several counties to raise forces to repel the foe Lord  Berkley  and  Henry Pay  admiral of the  cinque ports commanded at sea and burnt according to our ac∣counts fifteen of the  French  ships as they lay at anchor in  Mil∣ford Haven  and afterwards joined by Sir  Thomas Swinborn  took fourteen more in their passage to  Wales  laden with ammuni∣tion and provisions for the army  Walsingbam  who adds that a marshal and seven captains were takes at the same time    Madamoiselle de  LUSSAN takes notice of the first but candidly confesses that the  French  were so terrified with the appearance of thirty sail of our ships that they themselves directed the destruction of these vessels  IN the beginning of  August Henry  received advice that the  French  were landed and again sends out a proclamation dated from  Pontesract August  th addressed to the lieutenant of the county of  Hereford  with orders to raise without delay his forces and repair with them to the city of  Hereford  It is in this proclamation he expressly calls the  French  general lord of  Hugue∣vilie  HENRY marched in person to oppose an enemy now grown so very formidable  HENRY MARCHES AGAISST THEM  but  Hugueville  after plundering the country on the king's approach made a sudden retreat and posted him∣self on a high hill about three leagues from  Worcester  with a deep valley between his and the royal army Each endeavored to bring the enemy to make the attack and for eight days they respectively presented themselves in order of battle and so con∣tinued from morning till night but neither party ventured to descend from its advantageous situation During this time there  were several skirmishes The loss on both sides was about two hundred besides numbers wounded The  French  lost  Patrouil∣lart de Trie  lord of  Mouci  and  Plessis  chamberlain to the king and brother to the admiral a gallant officer whose fate was much lamented by the army *  Moreri  who says he fell a the attack of Haversordwest  There fell that day also the lord of  Martelonne  and the lord of  La Valle  and as  Hall  says the bastard of  Bourbon  Our historians seetn to exaggerate their loss adding to it that of five hundred other gentlemen but  Monstrelet  asserts that on a review of the  French  troops when they returned home only sixty were found mis∣sing  THE camp that  Owen  is supposed to have possessed is on  Wobury hill  in the parish of  Whittley  exactly nine miles northwest of  Worcester  It is surrounded with a single foss and contains near twentyseven acres It probably had been an antient  British  post but was extremely convenient for  Glyndwr  not only by reason of its strength but as  Wales  lay open to him he had it in his power to retreat among the mountains whenever he found it necessary I never had an opportunity of examining the na∣ture of the ground and how far it suits the description given by  Monstrelet  but the public will have their curiosity amply grati∣fied by the pen of my friend Dr NASH now employed in forming the history of his native county  HENRY acted the part of a prudent general by cutting off the means of every supply from the enemy who worn with famine and fatigue in the midnight of the eighth day decamped  with the utmost secrecy and retired into  Wales  Monstrelet    Hail      Monstrelet  makes the king quit his station first and return the same night to  Worces∣ter  and adds that the  French  attacked him in his retreat and took from him eighteen waggons loaden with provisions  Hall  on the contrary assures us that  Henry  chased the enemy from hilles to dales from dales to woddes from woddes to marishes and yet could never have them at any advantage A worlde it was to see his quotidiane removyng his paynfull and busy wan∣deryng his troublesome and uncertayne abidyng his con∣tinual mocion his daily peregrinacion in the desert felles and craggy mountains of that barreine unfertile and depopulate countrey  In the end the king unable any longer to subsi  his army in a country which  Glyndwr  had expressly destroyed to dutress his enemy was obliged to desist from his pursuit and to return to  Wercester  and as  Hall  owns in his retreat lost  cer∣tayn cariages laden with vitayle to his great displeasure and to the great comforte of the  Welsh  I MUST enquire when  Henry  had leisure for so long and tedioas a campaign  TIME OF THIS CAMPAIGN  for I find him the d of  August  at  Pontesrad  the  th  at  Worcester  and the  th  of  September  at  Heresord  In four days from that time it appears he was at  Faxflete  AT  Beverley  the  th  of the same month At  Bishopthorp  in the same county from the  th  to the st the next day at  Cawoed  After which there is an unaccounted gap of time till he appears again at  Worcester  the th of  October  I am thus minute to shew that  Henry  possessed a strength of body equal  to his activity of mind otherwise he never could have slown with that rapidity from place to place nor have guarded against enemies so remote as the  Scots  and  Welsh  at nearly the same period  IT seems as if all his forces destined to oppose the last were arrived at their places of rendezvous before the th of  October  Rymer viii  From that time he was in all probability engaged in this expe∣dition  Hall  assigning among other reasons for the king's de∣sisting from his enterprize the approach of winter which ren∣dered a campaign amidst the mountains highly unsafe Accor∣dingly we find him at  Dunstable  on his road to  London  the d of  November  Idem  and at his palace at  Westminster  soon after  Ibid    THE  French  after their slight never made any farther attempt  Glyndwr  placed them in quarters where they remained till they quitted the kingdom when he furnished the greater part with vessels to transport them to  France  FRENCH QUIT WALES  Fifteen hundred remained in  Wales  till the  March  following when they were carried home by a person styled by  de Lussan Le Begue de Volay  De Lassan iv  AFTER the defeat of  Gryssydd  son of  Glyndwr  by  Henry  prince of  Wales  that youthful warrior undertook the siege of  Llan∣bedr  castle in the county of  Cardigan  SIEGE OF LLAN∣BEDR CASTLE  After some time the governor placed there by  Glyndwr  agreed to give it up in case it was not relieved between the  th  of  October  and the feast of  All Saints  He was to surrender it in good condition not to injure the habitations in the town nor seize any ships that should be  driven into the port by distress of weather that he should have free pardon and have liberty at the end of the term to depart with all his effects and those of his friends I observe among the instruments of war which were to be delivered up were  canones  Anglicè  gunnes  which had been invented by the  French  about twentysix years before this period He took the sacra∣ment in witness of his sincerity and delivered hostages for the performance of his agreement He probably relied on the as∣sistance of the  French  for relief  Henry  apprehended the same But in order to frustrate any attempts of that kind he issued out a writ dated from  Cawood  the d of  September  to the lieutenants of  Devonshire  and of other counties to raise their forces and to rendezvous at  Evesham  on the th of  October  Rymer viii  This caution took effect so far as to oblige  Rees ap Gryffydd ap Shenkin  alias  Rees ap Llewelyn  to agree to the terms proposed but seemingly without any design of preserving them for no sooner was the prince departed than  Rees  permitted  Glyndwr  to turn him and his garrison out under pretence that they had been guilty of treason in submitting without his consent  Welsingham Holinshed    I MUST conclude the transactions of this year with remarking the solicitude of the lords and commons about the relief of the lord of  Coitie  SIEGE OF COITIE CASTLE BY GLYN∣  WR  then besieged in the castle of the same name seated near the river  Ogmore  in  Glamorganshire Henry  was little con∣cerned about his fate but several prelates and persons of rank in both houses offered a loan for the purpose of raising forces for his rescue At length it was agreed by king and parlement  that those loans should be repaid out of the first payments of the subsidy at that time granted  Drake  's Parliamentary History ii This was a very considerable for∣tress as appears by  Buck  's view of it vol ii N  o        FROM the latter end of last year the affairs of  Glyndwr  began to decline He had still strength sufficient to keep within his mountanous territories but was too weak to meditate any thing more than marauding invasions  FRENCH SEND MORE FORCES  The  French  continued to give him some assistance They sent a sleet of thirtyeight sail I imagine from the small number that they were wearied of their ally yet were willing to keep up for their own interest the spirit of the insurgents Eight of these ships laden with men at arms were taken the rest escaped in great confusion to  Wales  Walsingham      ABOUT this time  Owen  was considerably weakened by the de∣fection of the inhabitants of  Ystrad Tywy  THE presence of that brave and active prince  Henry  of  Mon∣mouth  who at the express request of parlement  Parliamentary Hist  ii  resided in some part of  Wales  was no small check on the enterprizing temper of  Glyndwr  nor a less terror to the  Welsh  who had felt the force of his arms At the same time parlement sensible of the folly of the premature grants before made of the estates of the insurgents entered on record that no heritages conquered from the  Welsh  be given away till one quarter of an year after  Ibid    so precarious seemed the tenure even in the declining state of our chiestain I may remark that he still had strength enough to give protection to the  English  fugitives The great earl of  Northumberland  and lord  Bardels  found here a hospitable asy∣lum after the  S  ts  to whom they had entrusted themselves meditated the giving of them up to  Henry  in exchange for cer∣tain prisoners Sir  David Fleming  of  Cumbernauld  generously warned them of the intentions of his countrymen who in re∣venge took away his life  Walsingham      BEFORE the expiration of this year  Henry  made a grant in fee to Sir  John Tibetot  speaker of the house of commons and father to the accomplished peer  John  earl of  Worcester  of the estates of  Richard ap Gryffydd ap Vychan  in the counties of  Caer∣marthen  and  Cardigan  forfeited by his adherence to the party of  Glyndwr  Parliamentary Hist  ii    GLYNDWR again was not behind hand in acts of regal

his chancellor both of whom the  English  historians say were made prisoners and sent to the Tower As  Henry  shewed no mercy to the partizans of  Owen  it is  probable that these two would have escaped his rage had  ever been in his power The other two witnesses are  Meredith  another of his sons and  Rhys ap Tudur  and  Gwillim ap  ******  NOTWITHSTANDING this ostentation of regal power  HIS AFFAIRS DE∣CLINE  the affairs of  Glyndwr  evidently declined The garrisons placed in most of the different fortresses of  North Wales  had kept the maritime parts from rising in any numbers in his favor In the island of  Auglesca  he seems to have had a very strong party It does not appear that there ever was any battle in that island It is my opi∣nion that the partizans of  Owen  had passed the  Menai  and while their zeal was warm had joined his army and like the custom in all feudal times returned to their homes when wearied with the campaign or satiated with plunder  BY the latter end of this year they had submitted to the royal authority for I find from a transcript of a manuscript found among the papers of the learned EDWARD LLWYD of the  Mu∣saeum  this particular  IN

were probably few and unim∣portant  Owen  had lost the fortresses of  Llanbedr  Near  Aberystwyth  is an old embattled house as I am informed called  Ty Crys  reported to have been  Glyndwr  's  which was soon retaken and that of  Harlech  He was consined to the hills and seems never to have quitted his fastnesses but to make a praedatory war The earl or  Northumberland  and lord  Bardols  about this time apprehending that  Owen  was too weak to pro∣tect them quitted  Wales  and soon after lost their lives in a des∣perate effort to restore their cause on  Bramham  moor in  York∣shire    IN this year I discover nothing relative to the  Welsh  affairs farther than a due compliment paid to the prince of  Wales  by the commons who by their speaker desired the king to give public thanks to young  Henry  for his great fatigue and good conduct in  Wales  for which both king and prince returned their compliments again to the commons  Rymer  viii      IN this year  Glyndwr  again began to make head  MAKES HEAD A∣GAIN  By him∣self or his partizans he made great devastations on the marches and in those parts of  Wales  that were well affected to the  English  government The estates of  Edward de Charlion  lord  Powys  suffered gre  ly  Henry  therefore directs a write to  nobleman to raiss his sorces and supp  s in the most  manner this new disturbance  ded as it appears by  himself

were both made prisoners sent to  London  and executed  Caxton  Cronycle of  Englonde    relates that  Rhys  was taken before the justices condemned and drawn on a hurdle through the city to  Tyburn  where he suffered the death of a traitor His quarters were sent to four other cities his head placed on  London  bridge  ON the th of  November  in this year  Henry  issued out an order to the constable of  Windsor  castle to deliver to Sir  Wil∣liam Liste  knight marshal of  England  the following  Welsh  pri∣soners  Howel ap Jevan ap Howell  Walther ap Jevan Vechan  Rys ap Jevan ap Rys

I imagine that all these gentlemen were delivered to the marshal for execution who by his commission seems to have been expressly appointed for that purpose  certis de causis ad ea omnia et singula quae ad officium  Marescalli Angliae  pertinent ex∣ercenda per litteras nostras patentes quam diu nobis placuerit duraturas deputavimus  TOWARDS the latter end of the year several of the officers of the lords marchers either through dislike to the war or for the sake of preserving their country from the fury of the  Welsh  of their own authority formed a truce with  Glyndwr  and his partizans This only served to enable them to make their in∣roads on other parts with more security Many of the loyal borderers were slain and others plundered in consequence of these agreements  Henry  was highly irritated and immediately issued out writs  Dated from  Northampton  d  November  to  Thomas  earl of  Arundel  Sir  Richard L'Estrange  lord of  Knockyn Ellesmere  and other borderirg manors  Edward Charlton  lord  Powys  and  Reginald  lord  Grey  of  Ruthyn  and to the deputylieutenant of  Heresordshire  directing them to  cause all such illegal compacts to be rescinded and  Glyndwr  and his adherents to be pursued and attacked with the utmost vi∣gor  FROM this period  Owen  never made any attempts worthy of historic notice Numbers of his followers deserted which obliged him to confine himself to the hills and to act entirely on the defensive Notwithstanding his power was reduced he was far from being subdued The years and were passed without any memorable actions The  English  were con∣tent with the ease they enjoyed by restraining the outrages of the mountaneers  Glyndwr  maintained that extensive tract that forms the  Alps  of our country and kept his prisoners so securely consined that even  Henry  in was under the necessity of permitting by writ  Dated  July  th  Rymer  viii  his esquire  Llewelyn ap Hoel  father to the noted  David Gam  to make use of Sir  John Tiptoste  and  William Botiller  to treat with  Owen  about the redemption of his son who was kept  forti et durâ prisonâ  or to endeavour to seize fome of  Glyndwr  's friends to exchange for  Gam  TREATY  What the result of this affair was does not appear It serves though to disprove the opinion that  David  escaped to  England  after his infamous at∣tempt in for which as is now evident he suffered a most fevere but merited captivity of ten years from which all the power of his  English  friends could not release him  THE prison where  Owen  confined his captives was not far from his house  THE PRISON OF GLYNDWR  in the parish of  Llansanfraid Glyndwrdwy  and the place is to this day called  Carchardy Owen Glyndwrdwy  Some  remains are still to be seen near the church which form part of a habitable house It consists of a room thirteen feet square and ten and a half high The sides consist of three horizontal beams with upright planks not four inches asunder mortised into them In these are grooves with holes in the bottom as if there had been originally crossbars or grates The roof is exceedingly strong composed of strong planks almost conti∣guous It seems as if there had been two stories but the up∣per part at present is evidently modern  IT is singular that the government did not take advantage of two  Welshmen  of rank whom they had this year in their power and whom they might have made the price of the liberty of their partizan These were  Rhys ap Tudur  of  Penmynydd  in  Angle∣sea  and his brother Perhaps they were taken after the treaty had its effect perhaps their crimes were too enormous for par∣don but whatsoever the case was they were both conveyed to  Chester  and there put to death  I MUST not omit that in  Henry  prince of  Wales  gave a free pardon to certain of his tenants in the comot of  Coleshill  in the county of  Flint  Harleian  MSS N  o    for the share they had in what was styled the rebellion of  Glyndwr  That county was much divided in those troubles  Howel Gwynedd  descended from  Edwin  lord of  Tegengle  a valiant gentleman who sided with our chieftain was in one of tire preceding years surprised by his enemies from the town of  Flint  He probably was posted within the trenches  of  Moel y Gaer  in the parish of  Northop  on which he was without process beheaded    HENRY died in the beginning of this year  HENEY DIES  and left his youth∣ful successor so engaged in his preparations for the conquest of  France  as to lose ail thoughts of the entire subjection of his  British  dominions  Glyndwr  remained still inaccessible but was so closely guarded as to cease to be tremendous The  W  sh  who had submitted now began to indulge their revenge against such of the  English  who had slain or otherwise injured any of their relations or friends in the late war This revenge was taken by various kinds of distress and imprisonment till they had cleared themselves by compurgation or made some satis∣factory agreement To remedy this  Henry  the Vth in his first year abolishes  Statutes at Large  Ruffhead  's ed i  Par un  ASSACH  solonc la cus∣tome de  GALES  dest à dire par la serement de CCC bommes  See also  Leges Wallicae    seq  the  Assach  or oath of men necessary ac∣cording to the custom of  Wales  to clear a person accused of any crime  ASSACH  Before that an  Englishman  was liable to continue in jail for life as it seems impossible for one of that hated nation to procure even a far less number of compurgators than this strange law required for his acquittal  Henry  made the attempt penal and the prosecutor liable to an imprisonment of two years to pay treble damages and to pay beside a fine and ransom before he could be released  THIS was the last of the many laws enacted against the  Welsh  on occasion of this insurrection  SEVERE LAWS  They were certainly very se∣vere yet perhaps no more than what any government would have directed against a people that had submitted to conquest near a hundred and twenty years and who were considered in no other light than that of rebellious subjects  ON the first insurrection conciliatory methods were tried and pardons offered After experience of the little effect these had on the minds of the  Welsh  every lenient step was laid aside and laws of a very severe nature were put in force against them  THE first was in the year It was found expedient to prevent as much as possible all intercourse between the  Welsh  and  English  The first were strongly attached to the cause of  Richard  the last had many secret favorers of that unhappy prince among them There appeared much danger if the for∣mer were permitted to strengthen their interest in  England  a coalition fatal to the new government was apprehended As a preventative it was enacted That no person born on both sides of  Welsh  parents should purchase lands or tenements near any of the cities or towns on the marches of  Wales  on pain of forfeit∣ing them to the lord paramount where such estates lay That no  Welshman  should be received into any corporation town or if they had been settled in any such before they were to find security for their good and loyal behaviour they were to be totally disquali∣fied from any civil office and never allowed to carry any weapons  IN case any  Welshman  refused to restore to any  Englishman  the cattle horses or the like which he had forcibly taken within seven days the  Englishman  was allowed to retaliate  So little trust was there in justice from our countrymen that it was enacted that no  Englishman  should be condemned at the suit of a  Welshman  unless by  English  justices or  English  bur∣gesses  So greatly did the government apprehend the seduction of  English  loyalty by the charms of our countrywomen that the  Eng∣lish  were prohibited from marrying with a  Welshwoman  under the pain of being disqualified from holding any office in  Wales  IN there is a very particular statute intended to remedy the mischiefs resulting from some customs peculiar to  Wales  This directs  KYMHORTHA  that  nul westour rymour minstrall ne vagabond soit aucunement sustenuz en la terre de  Gales  par faire kymorthas ou coillage sur le commune poeple illoeqes  I cannot give a better trans∣lation than that in the observations on the antient statutes by my esteemed friend the honorable DAINES BARRINGTON which is to this purpose THAT no host  I beg leave to render the word  westour  differently it seems derived from the  Welsh gwestwr  which signifies a person who kept a place of public entertainment and such a place was very proper for a rendezvous of this nature  rhymer minstrel or other vagabond should presume to assemble or collect together  THE word  kymhortha  is misspelt from the  Welsh cymmorth  or the plural  cymmorthau  assemblies of people to assist a neigh∣bor in any work Such are very frequently in use at present There are  cymmorthan  for spinning for works of husbandry for coalcarriage But at this time these meetings were mere pretences and their end was the collecting a sufficient number  of ablebodied men to make an insurrection Of such a nature in old times were the huntingmatches in  Scotland  The legisla∣ture in that part of  Great Britain  found the evils resulting from them and at length suppressed them by a law  BUT  cymhorthau  of our countrymen were at this period of a most tremendous nature They were composed of men the most dreaded by tyrants and usurpers of BARDS who animated our nation by recalling to mind the great exploits of our an∣cestors their struggles for liberty their successful contests with the  Saxon  and  Norman  race for upwards of eight centuries They rehearsed the cruelty of their antagonists and did not forget the savage policy of the first  Edward  to their proscribed bre∣thren They brought before their countrymen the remembrance of antient prophecies They shewed to them the hero  Glyndwr  descended from the antient race of our princes and pronounced that in him was to be expected the completion of every predic∣tion of our oracular MERLIN The band of minstrels now struck up the harp the  crwth  and the pipe filled the mea∣sure of enthusiasm which the others had begun to inspire They rushed to battle fearless of events like their great ancestry moved by the  Druids  songs and scorned death which conferred immortality in reward of their valor  Inde ruendi  In ferrum mens prona viris animaeque capaces  Mortis et ignavum est rediturae parcere vitae  LUCAN  Hence they no cares for this frail being feel  But rush undaunted on the pointed steel  Provoke approaching fate and bravely scorn  To spare that life which must so soon return  ROWS  WE find that  Glyndwr  maintained his situation for two year longer In his affairs bore so respectable an aspect that the king condescended to enter into a treaty with him and for that purpose deputed from the castle of  Porchester  The writ is dated  July  th  Rymer  ix  Sir  G  ocrt Talbot  with full powers to negotiate with  Owen  and even to offer him and his followers a free pardon in case they sliould request it Some writers say that this grace was obtained by the mediation of  David Holbech  deputy steward of the lordships of  Bromfield  and  Yale  DIATH OF OWEN  The event of this affair does not appear It is probable that it was interrupted by the death of our hero which happened on the th of  September  on the eve of St  Matthew  in the sixtyfirst year of his age at the house of one of his daughters but whether that of his daughter  Scudamore  or  Monnington  is uncertain but according to the tradition of the county of  Hereford  it may be supposed to have been at that of the last It is said that he was buried in the churchyard of  Monnington  but there is no monument or any memorial of the spot that contains his remains  BOTH the printed histories and the manuscript accounts re∣present his latter end to have been very miserable that he was dered from place to place in the habit of a shepherd in a l  VALLE CRUCIS ABBY  and forlorn condition and was even forced to take shelter in caves and desert places from the fury of his enemies  Rymir  ix  This does not wear the face of probability for had his situation been so deplorable majesty would never have condescended to propose terms to such a scourge as  Glyndwr  had been to his kingdom This retreat and the distresses he underwent were probably after the battle of  Pwll Melyn  in from which he quickly emer∣ged Death alone deprived  Owen  of the glory of accepting an offered accommodation The treaty was renewed by the same minister on the th of  February  with  Meredydd ap Owen  the son of  Glyndwr  which it is to be supposed took effect and peace was restored to  England  after an indecisive strug∣gle of more than fifteen years Our chieftain died unsub∣dued unfortunate only in foreseeing a second subjugation of his country after the loss of the great supporter of its inde∣pendency  HAVING now collected every thing in my power relating to this celebrated  Briton  I return by the same road cross the  Dee  at

Anian  commonly known by the name of  Y Brawd duo Nannau  or the black brother of  Nanney  a  Dominican  consecrated in  Idem  who brought his cause before the pope's delegates the official of  Canterbury  and the abbot of  Tallelechew  and ob∣tained a decision in favor of him and his successors but as there was some doubt about the patronage of the church of  Llan∣degla  they allotted in lieu of it to the abby a third of the tithes of  BrynEglwys  Ibid    THE landed endowments were not inconsiderable  REVENUES  In the year the abbot was found to have near the monastery a grange with three ploughlands a mill and other conveni∣encies valued at £  The granges of  Bodhange Tregam Rudryn  and  Baketon  set for  Also the dairyfarm of  Nante  the grange of  Nu∣stroyz Convenet  and

The last abbot was  John Herne  who received an annuity of  l  on his surrender This and  l    s    d  in annuities to some surviving monks were the only charges remaining in  Willis  's Abbies ii    THIS place remained in the crown till the  th  of  James  I who granted it to  Edward Wotton  afterwards created lord  Wotton  In we find a lady  Margaret Wotton  a recusant to have been in possession and that it was put under sequestration by orders of the commissioners from the ruling powers  THERE still remain the ruins of the church  CHURCH  and part of the abby the last inhabited by a farmer The church was built in form of a cross in different styles of architecture The most antient is that of the east end where the windows are in form of long and narrow slips pointed at top The window at the west end is large divided by stone tracery and above is a round window of elegant work Above it is an inscription in memory of the person who repaired or rebuilt this part an honor frequently paid to benefactors of this kind It is in this form ĀD ADAM DMS  Fecit Hoc opus Pace Beata quiescat  Amen And just beneath are the letters M D probably part of the date the rest being lost We cannot ascertain the person intended in this line He was pro∣bably  one of the house of  Trevawr  in which that name occurs more than once as  Adam  or  Adda Vawr  of  Trevawr  and  Adam  or  Adda ap Jorwerth Ddu  of  Pengwern  THE capitals of the pilasters within the church are finished with elegant foliage In the north transept is a cloister of two arches an arch that once contained a tomb and near it a double  benetoire  or holywater pot  MUCH of the building is made of the coarse slaty stone of the country The door and window frames of fine free∣stone  THE abbot's apartment was contiguous to the church There opens from it a small space where he might stand to hear the holy offices performed below  THE lower part of the abby is vaulted and supported by rows of low pillars now divided into different rooms In front is a large window with curious stone tracery which reaches to the ground Within seems to have stood a small staircase which led to the fratry a paved room above the arches  IN one of the present bedchambers is a stone now part of a chimneypiece carved with running foliage with this imperfect inscription  Hie jacet  ARVRVET This is the only relique of any tomb that of the founder who was buried here  Powel    is no more nor yet that of  Gryffydd ap Madoc Maelor  lord of  Dinas Brân  who after siding with the enemies of his country in was deposited within these walls  Idem    VALLE CRUCIS ABBY  PILLAR OF ELISEG  ABOUT a quarter of a mile higher up the vale  PILLAR OF EAISEQ  in the hedge of a meadow I met with the remainder of a round column perhaps one of the most antient of any  British  inscribed pillar now existing  IT was entire till the civil wars of the last century when it was thrown down and broken by some ignorant fanatics who thought it had too much the appearance of a cross to be suf∣fered to stand It probably bore the name of one for the field it lies in is still called  LlwynyGroes  or the Grove of the Cross from the wood that surrounded it It was erected at so early a period that there is nothing marvellous if we should perceive a tincture of the old idolatry or at left of the primeval customs of our country in the mode of it when per∣fect  THE pillar never had been a cross notwithstanding folly and superstition might in later times imagine it to have been one and have paid it the usual honors It was a memorial of the dead an improvement on the rude columns of  Druidical  times and cut into form and surrounded with inscription It is among the first lettered stones that succeeded the  Meinihirion Meini∣Gwŷr  and  Llcchau  It stood on a great  tumulus  perhaps always environed with wood as the mount is at present according to the custom of the most antient times when standing pillars were placed under  every green tree  Kings ii See the learned  Rowlands      It is said that the stone when complete was twelve feet high It is now reduced to six feet eight The remainder of the  capital is eighteen inches long It stood infixed in a square pe∣destal still lying in the mount the breadth of which is five feet three inches the thickness eighteen inches  THE beginning of the inscription gives us nearly the time of its erection  Concenn  filius  Cateli Catteli  filius  Broch∣mail Broch∣mail  filius  Eliseg Eliseg  filius  Cnoillaine Concenn  itaque prone∣pos  Eliseg  edificavit hunc lapidem proavo suo  Eliseg  THIS  Concenn  or  Congen  was the grandson of  Brochmail Ys∣cithroc  the same who was defeated in at the battle of  Chester  BEDE Hist lib ii c p  The letters on the stone were copied by Mr  Edward Llwyd  the inscription is now illegible but from the copy taken by that great antiquary the alphabet nearly resembles one of those in use in the sixth century  Vide Doctor MORTON'S Table of Alphabeth    ONE of the seats of  Concenn  and  Eliseg  was in this country A township adjacent to the column bears from the last the name of  Eglwyseg  and the picturesque tiers of rocks are called  Gliseg  for the same reason The habitation of this prince of  Powys  in these parts was probably  Dinas Brân  which lies at the head of the vale of  Gliseg  Mr  Llwyd  conjectures that this place took its name from the interment of  Eliseg  by a similar in∣stance in the county of  Caermarthen  where the place in which a monumental stone stands is called  Pant y Polion  corruptly for  Pant Pawlin  from  Paulinus  the person it was inscribed to  Servator fidei patriaeque semper amator  Hic PAULINUS jacet cultor pientissimus aequi  Vide Appendix Mr  Llwyd's  Letter    THERE are two ways from this pillar the usual is along the vale on an excellent turnpikeroad leading to  Ruthyn  the other is adapted only for the travel of the horsemen but far the more preferable on account of the romantic views I returned by  Valle Crucis  and after winding along a steep midway to the old castle descended and after crossing the rill of the  Brán  ar∣rived in the valley of  Glisseg  VALLEY OF GLISSEG  long and narrow bounded on the right by the asbonishing precipices divided into numberless paral∣lel strata of white limestone often giving birth to vast yewtrees and on the left by smooth and verdant hills bordered by pretty woods One of the principal of the  Glisseg  rocks is honored with the name of  CraigArthur  That at the end of the vale is called  Craig y Forwyn  or the maiden's is bold precipitous and termi∣nates with a vast natural column  THIS valley is chiefly inhabited happily by an independent race of warm and wealthy yeomanry undevoured as yet by the great men of the country  IN order to get into the great road I pursued a path up a steep ascent to the left and about midway visited a house noted for being the residence of one  Edward Davies  a low partizan and plunderer on the side of the usurper during the civil wars He was best known in his own country by the title of  Cneifiwr Glâs  CNEIPIWR GLAS  or the  Blue Shaver  from his rapacity and the color of his cloaths and was considered as a fit instrument of the tyranny of the times In he was appointed by the commissioners for sequestration steward of the courtleet within the manor of  Valle Crucis  being recommended to the office by colonel  George Twisleton  The  Cneifiwr  seems to have not been overtrue to his  own party when his interest stood in the way He was accus∣tomed to take even the royalists under his protection on receiving a proper reward He once concealed Sir  Evan Llwyd  of  Bodi∣dris  at the time that a considerable sum was ordered for his apprehension He lodged him in a cellar below the parlor then summoning his people ordered them in a seeming rage to sally out in quest of Sir  Evan  stamping with his foot and declaring that if the knight was  above ground  he would have him  AFTER continuing an ascent for a little space longer reach the pass called  Bwlch y Rhiw Velen  BWLCH Y RHIW VELEN  and fall again into the great road This place is distinguished by the deaths of two of the sons of  Llowarch Hên  LLOWARCH HEN  the  Cumbrian  prince of the sixth century who were slain in battle and whose loss the princely bard their father deplores in an elegy of which these lines are a fragment  Bedh GUELL yn y  Rhiw Velen  Bedh SAWYL yn  Llan Gollen  Lhwyd  's Archzol    GUELL found a grave in  Rhiw Velen  SAWYL in  Llan Gollen  LLOWARCH HEN left his country to expel the  Saxons  and  Irish  out of this part of  Britain  He leaves us ignorant of the event all he acquaints us with is that he lost twelve sons in the gene∣rous attempt  FROM the height above  Rhiw Velen  is a very extensive pro∣spect of the hundred of  Yale  hilly fertile in grass abundant in cattle but in this part dreary and destitute of hedges and woods banks for the most part supply the place of the first and brakes of the latter After some descent cross the  Alyn  Here a trifling rill which after running for some time receives much increase waters the rich vales of  Mold  and  Hope  and passes between the picturesque banks from near  Caergwrle  to  Gresford  where it goes through an extensive flat and falls into the  Dee  midway between  Holt  and  Eaton  Boat Leave a little to the left a place called  Havod yr Abad  the site of one of the countryseats of the abbot of  Valle Crucis  Close to the road∣side lies  Tommen y Rhodwydd  once a fortress known by the name of the castle of  Yale  Powel    built by  Owen Gwynedd  about the year  Powel    This is the place  Leland  mistakenly calls a castle belonging to  Owen Glyndwr  ‡ It consists of a vast artificial mount with another still loftier near one end the keep of the place These are surrounded with a great foss and rampart and have only a single entrance At present there are not the lest reliques of the superstructure which was probably of wood for we are told that this shortlived castelet was burnt nine years after its erection by  Jorwerth Goch ap Meredydd  Powel      IT is in this manner we must account for the total disappear∣ance of many  Welsh  castles whose names are preserved in history  WOODEN CASTLES  and whose vestiges we have sought for in vain They were made of wood as was very customary with several antient na∣tions  and with others of later date The  Persians  on the ap∣proach of the  Spartans  secured themselves within their wooden walls and  Cesar  found great resistance from a tower in the  Al∣pine  castle of  Larignum  made of the timber of the  Larix  or the  Larch  which was found to be incombustible  Vitruvsius  lib  ii c p  In later times the castle of  Bamborough  was built originally by  Ida  with wood the burgh of  Murray  was fortified by the  Danes  with the same material The people of the same county in had castles of wood  Annals Scotland  and a century after these more recent instances  William de Melton  archbishop of  York  in fortified the mount in that city called the  Old Bale  with planks eighteen inches thick  WHENSOEVER we find an antient fortress totally vanished and we cannot account for the disposal of the materials in the erecting of any neighboring buildings we must suppose that they had been constructed of wood and that they had been destroyed by fire either flung into them by means of torches or by  veltae  or vast masses of combustibles rolled against them by the force of numbers as was the practice of the antient  Scandi∣navians  described by  Olaus Magnus  FROM  Tommen y Rhodwydd  I crossed the country for about two miles to the village of  Llandegla  LLANDEGLA  noted for its vast fairs for black cattle The church is dedicated to St  Tecla  virgin and martyr who after her conversion by St  Paul  suffered under  Nero  at  Iconium  ABOUT two hundred yards from the church in a quillet called  Gwern Degla  rises a small spring with these letters cut on freestone A G  G  ST TECLAS'S WELL  The water is under the tutelage of the saint and to this day held to be extremely beneficial in the  Clwyf Tegla  St  Tecla  's disease or the fallingsickness The patient washes his limbs in the well makes an offering into it of four pence walks round it three times and thrice repeats the Lord's prayer These ceremonies are never begun till after sunset in order to inspire the votaries with greater awe If the afflicted be of the malesex like  Socrates  he makes an of∣fering of a cock to his  Aesculapius  or rather to  Tecla Hygeia  if of the fairsex a hen The fowl is carried in a basket first round the well after that into the churchyard when the same orisons and the same circumambulations are performed round the church The votary then enters the church gets under the communiontable lies down with the Bible under his or her head is covered with the carpet or cloth and rests there till break of day departing after offering six pence and leaving the fowl in the church If the bird dies the cure is supposed to have been effected and the disease transferred to the devoted victim  FROM hence I visited the house of  Bodidris  BODIDRIS  a large and antient place belonging to  Evan Lloyd Vaughan  Esq  of  Corsygedol  in right of his mother  Margaret  daughter of Sir  Evan Lloyd  ba∣ronet the last male of the family descended from  ynyr ap Howel ap Moriddig ap Sandde Hardd  who by his valor at the battle of  Corwen  in obtained from his prince the honorable dis∣tinction in his arms of four bloody strokes or in the heralds  phrafe paly of eight  or  and  gules  For while he was talk∣ing to his prince after the fight with his left hand smeared with blood he accidentally drew it across his sword and left on it the marks of his four fingers The prince observing this ordered him to carry them on his shield and at the same time bestowed on him the township of  Gelligynan  in this neighbor∣hood as a more substantial mark of his favor  BODIDRIS takes its name from  Idris  son of  Llewelyn  AUR∣DORCHOG  or of the goden torques  the antient lord of  Yale  It stands in two counties  Flintshire  and  Denbighshire  the long table in the hall having an end in each  FROM hence I continued my journey to  Llanarmon  LLAMARMON  a village whose church is dedicated to St  Germanus  bishop of  Auxerre  who with St  Lupus  contributed to gain the famous  Victoria Alleluiatica  over the Picts and  Saxons  near  Mold  He was a most popular patron and has numbers of other churches in  Wales  un∣der his protection An image of an ecclesiastic still to be seen in the churchwall is called his In  Leland's  days there was a great resort of pilgrims and large offerings at this place  Leland's  Itin  v  and probably to this imaginary reseinblance of him  IN the church is the tomb of a grandson of the bloodyfingered warrior above mentioned carrying on his shield the arms won by his ancestor inscribed around  Hic jacet Grusudd ap Lhewelyn ap Ynyr  At his feet lies a dog gnawing a heap of intestines The tradition of the country is that he engaged in  a  crusade  in which he lost his life by a wound in the abdomen that his bowels fell out and were seized by a dog as expressed by the sculptor If he fell in the romantic cause of the holy sepulchre the artist must have forgot to have placed him crosslegged the monumental distinction of all such knightserrant The tomb is a chest cut out of one stone in which his body was put and sent home The lid is another stone with his effigies carved out of it  SEPULCHARAL  tumuli  are very frequent in this parish  TUMILI  I was present at the opening of one composed of loose stones and earth covered with a layer of soil about two feet thick and over that a coat of verdant turf In the course of our search were discovered towards the middle of the tumulus several urns made of sunburnt clay of a reddish color on the outside black within being stained with the ashes they contained Each was placed with the mouth downwards on a flat stone above each was another to preserve them from being broken by the weight above Mixed with the loose stones were numerous fragments of bones such as parts of the thighbones the armbones and even a scull These had escaped the effects of the fire of the funeral pile and were deposited about the urns which con∣tained the residuum of the corpse that had been reduced to pure ashes  I SHALL mention in the following pages the high antiquity of this custom that it was in use with the most polished nations with the  Greeks  and with the  Romans  as well as with the most barbarous The antient  Germans  practised this rite as appears  from  Tacitus  De moribus German  The  Druids  observed the same with the wild addition of whatsoever was of use in this life under the notion that they would be wanted by the deceased in the world below and in confirmation of this arms and many singular things of unknown use are to this day discovered beneath the places of antient sepulture  Mela lib iii c    THE remote  Sarmatae  and all the  Scandinavian  nations agreed in the burning of the dead and the  Danes  distinguished by this and the different funeral ceremonies three several epochs  Wormii Mon Danic    THE first which was the same with that in question was called  Roisold  and  Brendetiide  or the age of burning  THE second was styled  Hoigold  and  Hoielsetiide  or the age of  tumuli  or hillocks The corpse at this period was placed entire with all the ornaments which graced it during life The bracelets or arms and even the horse of the departed hero were placed beneath the heap Money and all the rich property of the deceased used to be buried with him from the persuasion that the soul was immortal  Pomponius Mela  lib  iii c  and would stand in need of these things in the other life Such was the notion both of the  Gauls  and of the northern nations Among the last when py∣racy was esteemed honorable these illustrious robbers directed that all their rich plunder should be deposited with their re∣mains  Bartholinus  Antiq  Dan  in order to stimulate their offspring to support them∣selves and the glory of their name by deeds of arms Hence it is we hear of the vast riches discovered in sepulchres and of  the frequent violation of the remains of the dead in expecta∣tion of treasures even for centuries after this custom had ceased  THE third age was called  Christendomsold  when the introduc∣tion of Christianity put a stop to the former customs for 'Christians' as the learned physician of  Norwich  observes  ab∣horred this species of obsequies and though they stickt not to give their bodies to be burnt in their lives detested that mode after death affecting rather depositure than absumption and properly submitted unto the sentence of GOD to return not unto ashes but to dust again  FROM the remarks of these able writers we may learn the time of the abolition of the custom of burning among the se∣veral nations for it ceased with paganism It therefore fell first into disuse with the  Britons  for it was for some time retained by the  Saxons  after their conquest of this king∣dom but was left off on their receiving the light of the go∣spel The  Danes  retained the custom of urnburial the last of any for of all the northern nations who had any footing in these kingdoms they were the latest who embraced the doc∣trines of Christianity  I CANNOT establish any criterion by which a judgment may be made of the people to whom the different species of urns and tumuli belonged whether they are  British Roman Saxon  or  Danish  SOME of the tumuli consist of heaps of naked stones such as those in the isle of  Arran  in many parts of  Scotland  and in some parts of  Cornwall  OTHERS are composed like this of  Llanarmon  with stones and earth nicely covered with earth and sod Of these the base is in certain places level with the ground in others surrounded with a trench they were sometimes formed of earth only Others are of a conoid form and some oblong of which there is an example in the neighborhood of  Bryn y pys  called the  Giant's Grave  Finally other places of antient sepulture con∣sisted only of a flat area encompassed like the  Druidical  circles with upright stones and such were those of  Ubbo  and of king  Harald  in  Sweden  Suecia  Antiqua et Hodierna  tab      THE urns are also found placed in different manners with the mouth resting downwards upon a flat stone secured by an∣other above or with the mouth upwards guarded in a like way  VERY frequently the urns are discovered lodged in a square cell composed of flags Sometimes more than one of these cells are found beneath a  carn  or  tumulus  I have even met with near  Dupplin  in  Perthshire  not fewer than seventeen disposed in a circular form  Tour in  Scotland  iii  When numbers are found together the tu∣mulus was either a familycemetery or might have contained the reliques of a number of heroes who perished with glory in the same cause for such honors were paid only to the great and good  THE urns found in these cells are usually surrounded with the fragments of bones that had resisted the fire for the friends of the deceased were particularly careful to collect every particle  which they placed with the remains of the charcoal about the urns thinking the neglect the utmost impiety We have no certainty of the ceremonies used by the antient  Britons  on these mournful occasions but from many circumstances which we continually discover in our tumuli there appear many analo∣gous to those used in antient  Greece  and  Rome  THE  Greeks  first quenched the funeral pile with wine and the companions or relations of the departed performed the rest Such was the ceremony at the funeral of  Patroclus  Where yet the embers glow  Wide o'er the pile the sable wine they throw  And deep subsides the ashy heap below  Next the white bones his sad companions place  With tears collected in the golden vase  The sacred reliques to the tent they bore  The urn a veil of linen cover'd o'er  That done they bid the sepulchre aspire  And cast the deep foundations round the pyre  High in the midst they heap the swelling bed  Of rising earth memorial of the dead  Iliad  lib  xxiii L    POPE  THE duty of collecting the bones and ashes fell to the next of kin Thus  Tibullus  pathetically entreats death to spare him in a foreign land least he should want the tender offices of his nearest relations  Me tenet ignotis aegrum  Phaeacia  terris  Abstineas avidus mors violenta manus  Abstineas mors atra precor non hic mihi mater  Quae legat in maestos ossa perusta sinus  Non soror  Assyrios  cineri quae dedat odores  Et fleat effusis ante sepulcra comis  DELIA non usquam  Eigia  lib i el    Here  In  Ph  acia    languishing beneath a foreign sky  An unknown victim to disease I lie  In pity then suspend thy lifted dart  Thou tyrant Death nor pierce my throbbing heart  No mother near me her last debt to pay  Collect my bones my ashes bear away  No sister o'er my funeral pile shall mourn  Nor mix  Assyrian  incense in my urn  Nor  Deita  thou oh thou my soul's first care  Shall with thy dear dishevell'd locks be there  R W  I BEG leave to add the account given by  Virgil  of the funereal rites of  Pallas  Lib xi I  We find in it many ceremonies that were used by the northern nations Animals of different species were burnt or deposited with the body The spoils of war and weapons of various kinds were placed on the pile the bones and ashes were collected together and a heap of earth or a  tumulus  flung over them Each of these circumstances are continually disco∣vered in our barrows Horns and other reliques of quadrupeds weapons of brass and of stone all placed under the very same sort of tombs as are described by  Homer  and  Virgil  Perhaps  the other ceremonies were not omitted but we have no record that will warrant us to assert that they were in all respects simi∣lar  Jam pater  Aeneas  c  The  Tuscan  chief and  Trojan  prince command  To raise the funeral structures on the strand  Then to the piles as antient rites ordain  Their friends convey the relicks of the slain  From the black flames the sullen vapours rise  And smoke in curling volumes to the skies  The foot thrice compass the highblazing pyres  Thrice move the horse in circles round the fires  Their tears as loud they howl at ev'ry round  Dim their bright arms and trickle to the ground  A peal of groans succeeds and heav'n rebounds  To the mixt cries and trumpet's martial sounds  Some in the flames the wheels and bridles throw  The swords and helmets of the vanquishi'd foe  Some the known shields their brethren bore in vain  And unsuccessful jav'lins of the slain  Now round the piles the bellowing oxen bled  And bristly swine in honour of the dead  The fields they drove the fleecy flocks they slew  And on the greedy flames the victims threw  PITT  SINCE I am engaged in this funebrious subject it will be fit to observe that a discovery of an entire skeleton placed between flags of a proportionable size was made near this place This  as well as others similar in different parts of our islands evinces that the antient inhabitants did not always commit their bodies to the fire for besides this instance a skeleton thus inclosed was found in one of the  Orknies  Letter from the Rev Mr  Low  of  Birsa  and others in the shire of  Murray  and with one of the last was found an urn with ashes and several pieces of charcoal  Tour  Scotl  q  arto ed  whichshews that each practice was in use in the same age  FROM  Llanarmon  I continued my journey along the bad roads of that parish The country now grows more contracted by the approximation of the hills On one side are the rocky ledges of limestone in the township of  Tre'r Yrys  rich in leadore and which is supposed to have taken its name from  Gyrys  who made the first collection of  Welsh  proverbs known by the name of  Madwaith bén Gyrys o Jal  or the good work of old Gyrys of  Yale  ON the left are the  Clwydian  hills which divide this country from the vale of  Clwyd  These are cultivated pretty high are free from rocks covered with heath  THERE is a  Bwlch  or pass through these hills of a most re∣markable name lying between the summits called  Moel Eithinen  and  Moel Fenlli  in this parish This is called  Bwlch Agricla  or the pass of  Agriccla  and since there is no other translation to be given of the  welsh  word we may conjecture this to have been his passage to  Mona  That the  Romans  were in aftertimes resident in these parts is evident from the number of coins found  in the neighborhood particularly in the parish of  Llanverres  where abundance of  Denarii  have been met with  MOEL FENLLI or  Benlli  's hill is remarkable for having on it a strong  British  post guarded as usual by dikes and fosses This probably was possessed by a chieftain of that name for  Nen∣nius  C xxx xxxi  speaks of such a  regulus  of the country of  Yale  but as too usual with our antient historians blends so ridiculous a legend with the mention of him as would destroy belief of his existence did not the hill remain a possible evidence St  Ger∣manus  says the abbot designed to make this  Benlli  a visit but meeting with a most inhospitable reception was kindly enter∣tained by a servant of the king in his humble cottage who killed his only calf dressed and placed it before the saint and his companions This goodness met with its reward for lo the next morning the identical calf was found alive and well with its mother  A LITTLE beyond this pass entered the parish of  Llanverres  rich in mineral Pass through the village and by the church The last is dedicated to St  Berres Britius  disciple of St  Mar∣tin  the  Hungarian  and his succesor in the bishoprick of  Tours  the latter end of the fourth century The church at this time was rebuilding chiefly by the bounty of Mrs  Catherine Jones  of  Clommendy  THE east end of the old church was repaired in by Dr  John Davies  the author of the  WelshLatin  dictionary a most skilful antiquary native of this parish  IN the course of my ride cross the turnpikeroad between  Mold  and  Ruthyn  which after a long ascent passes  Bwlch Pen∣yBarras  a spot extremely worthy of the traveller's attention on account of the beautiful view over the vale of  Clwyd  MY route this time led me eastward along the great road into the county of FLINT  THIS spot being confirmed to it by the event of a most ex∣pensive lawsuit by the court of exchequer in between the  Grosvenour  family and the lords of the manor of  Mold  the first claming it as part of his mineral grant of the hundred of  Yale  the others affirming it to be part of the county of  Flint  and within the parish of  Mold  The decision which was in favor of the lords of  Mold  is recorded on an arch over a noted stone called  Carreg Carn March Arthur  which was then ad∣judged to be the boundary of the parish of  Mold  in the county of  Flint  and of  Llanverres  in that of  Denbigh  I CONTINUED along the great road and within two miles of  Mold  hung long over the charming vale which opens with ex∣quisite beauty from  Vron  the seat of the ingenious  Richard Williams  Esquire  Cambria  here lays aside her majestic air and condescends to assume a gentler form in order to render less violent her approaching union with her  English  neighbor It were to be wished she had acted with more moderation and not outshone it at a rate the most partial  Saxon  must allow it to have done  THIS was antiently called  YstradAlun  or the  Strath  of the  alun  a comot in the cantref  Y Rhiw  inhabited by a hardy race at perpetual feud with the men of  Cheshire  on one side and the men of  Yale  on the other for my countrymen never suffered their active swords to rust in default of  Saxon  they would take up with the blood of their  Cambrian  neighbors  ON the first regulation of the  Welsh  counties by  Henry  VIII this vale then called  Molesdale  with the continuation of it which went under the name of  Hopesdale  were annexed to the county of  Denbigh  but in the d year of the same monarch were given to  Flintsire  ALMOST the whole is seen from this spot a delicious compo∣sition of rich land finely bounded by gentle risings watered by  Alun  and varied with a pretty town and fine church in the middle with numbers of seats groves and wellcultivated farms Among the former appears conspicuous  Leeswood  the creation of the late Sir  George Wynne  rising palacelike along a fine slope on the south side of the vale surrounded with woods and lawns a sad  Mausoleum  of fugacious wealth The distant view is not less beautiful The three fine estuaries of the  Dee Weever  and  Mersey  the hills of  Cheshire  and the more remote range of those of  Shropshire Staffordshire Derbyshire Yorkshire Lancashire Westmoreland  and  Cumberland  complete this beautiful scene  FROM hence to the town of  Mold  is a pleasant ride  Mold  consists principally of one broad and handsome street on a gentle rising in the midst of a small but rich plain The church is placed on an eminence and is of the time of  Henry  VIII  adorned with a very handsome steeple built of late years Before the Reformation it belonged to the abby of  Bustlesham  or  By∣sham  in  Berkshire  The living is a vicarage and has dependent on it the chapelries of  Nerquys  and  Treuddyn  THE architecture of the church is of the gothic of that pe∣riod the windows large and their arches obtuse Within and without is a row of animals carved as usual at that period The same may be observed on the old building over St  Winifrede  's well The inside is extremely elegant con∣sists of a nave and two ailes supported by seven arches whose pillars are much to be admired for their lightness They consist of four round pilasters with the intermediate space hollowed and the capitals elegantly carved Between the springs of every arch is an angel holding a shield on which are either the arms of benefactors or the instruments of the Passion The arms of the  Stanlies  who long possessed this manor are very frequent Among the other sculptures is the  Veronica  or face of our Saviour impressed on a handkerchief given to him by a woman on his way to the place of crucifixion He took it wiped his face and returned it with the miraculous impression This precious relique is preserved in St  Peter  's at  Rome  and the woman worshipped as a saint under the name of the  Handker∣chief  which at first was called the  Vera Icon  or true image but becoming thus personified received the title of St  Veronica  Beneath two windows above the chancel are carved in a rude manner the nails pincers and other tokens of the cruci∣fixion  AT the eastern ends of the two ailes are three gothic niches elegantly carved They formerly were filled with images now destroyed The two in the south aile are almost hid with mo∣numents Among them is a very superb one in memory of

him∣self several years before his decease merits publication  WILLIAM WYNNE of  Tower  D D  Some time fellow of  AllSouls  College in  Oxford  and rector of  Llanvechan  in this diocese departed this life aged  He died  March  d aged This now fills these blanks  In conformity to an antient usage from a proper regard to decency and a concern for the health of his fellowcreatures he was moved to give particular directions for being buried in the adjoining churchyard and not in the church  And as he scorned flattering of others while living he has taken care to prevent being flattered himself when dead by causing this small memorial to be set up in his lifetime  GOD be merciful to me a sinner Heb  DDUW  Heb ddim  At the northend of the town stands the mount to which it owes the  British  and  Latin  names YR WYDDGRUG and MONS ALTUS  the lofty  or  conspicuous mount  This is partly natural partly artificial Our  British  ancestors and afterwards the  Saxons  and  Normans  taking advantage of so defencible an emi∣nence cut it into form and placed on it a castle It is possible that the  Romans  might also have had some concern in it for a beautiful gold coin of  Vespasian  was found here but this being the only proof of its having been possessed by them I shall not insist on it any farther than to urge the probability  Mold  being in the neighborhood of many of their mines and of places where much of their money has been found  THE mount is now called the  Bailey  hill from the word  Bal∣lium  or castleyard It appears to have been strongly for∣tified by great ditches notwithstanding its arduous ascent It is divided into three parts the lower  Ballium  or yard the up∣per and the keep or  Donjon  The tops of the two first are levelled by art and all are separated by deep fosses The keep was on a part greatly and artificially elevated and around its edges are a few stones the only reliques of the fortress On one side of the upper yard are found vast quantities of bones some human others of animals mostly domestic such as of oxen sheep horses and hogs and a few remnants of horns of stags and roebucks  THE summit of this hill commands a short but most exqui∣site view of the circumjacent vale and to the west  Moel famma  rises with aweful preeminence among the  Clwydian  hills  THE first certain account I have of this place is in the reign of  William Rufus  when we find it in possession of  Eustace Cruer  Powel    who then did homage for  Mold  and  Hopedale  he probably hav∣ing been the person who had ravished them from the antient owners  IN the end of the reign of  Henry  I or the beginning of that of  Stephen Robert  called from his residence at this place  de Mont∣alto  high steward of  Chester  and one of the barons of the  Nor∣man  earls became owner of it We are informed that the castle was at this time very strong and that it had been often besieg∣ed but never taken till the  Welsh  no longer able to bear the ravages of the garrison attempted in    the reduction of it under the conduct of their gallant prince  Owen Gwynedd  The garrison for a considerable time defended the place with great courage but at length it was taken by storm part of the defendants slain the others taken prisoners and the fortress razed to the ground  Idem    AFTER this it was again restored for we find in the  aerae CambroBritannicae  At the end of  Llwya  's Com∣mentariolum      that it was taken in the winter of by  Llewelyn ap Jorwerth  and about the year it was a third time besieged taken and demolished by  Gryffydd ap Gwenwynwyn  lord of  Powis  THE gentry of  Ystradalun  or  Molesdale  were among the prin∣cipal complainants of wrongs done to them by  Roger de Clifford  justiciary of  Chester  and his deputy  Roger Scrochil  a little be∣fore  our subjection by  Edward  I They alleged that their lands were taken from them that they were grievously and unjustly fined on trivial occasions and that after paying a sum for exemp∣tion from  English  laws they were obliged to submit to a trial by jury or by twelve men contrary to the usage of their country  Powel      MUCH of the country was in this reign so covered with woods that  Edward  before his conquest of  Wales  was obliged to cut a passage through them in the tract between  Mold  and a place then called  Swerdewood  and to direct that nothing should be required for the damage done to the owners  Rotuli Wallia    Anno    Edwardi  I  Febr  We find a similar order in  Rymer  I find he called in a number of cutters for this purpose and in the next year not fewer than two hundred cutters and colliers  carbonarii  who were summoned out of the forest of  Dean  and the county of  Hereford  under the conduct of  Gilbert de Clare  earl of  Gloster  IN the year Sir  Gryffydd Llwyd  a valiant gentleman who was knighted by  Edward  I on bringing the news of the birth of his son  Edward  of  Caernarvon  and who after our con∣quest adhered to the  English  till he thought their yoke into∣lerable rose in arms overrun all  North Wales  and the  Marches  and among others seized on this castle but his attempt was unsuccessful being defeated and taken prisoner  Powel    Wynn      FROM this time we hear no more of it as a place of defence  Matthew Paris  and  Dugdale  M Paris    Dugdale Baron  i  confound it with  Hawarden  and assert it to have been attacked or taken by  David  brother to the last  Llewelyn Mold  continued in possession of the posterity of  Robert    who did homage for it in at  Chester  to  Edward  prince of  Wales    but in the last baron in default of male issue conveyed it to  Isabel  queen of  Edward  II for life and afterwards to  John  of  Eltham  younger brother to  Edward  III who died without issue and his possessions reverted to the crown  I AM uncertain how long the crown reserved this lordship I find it was granted to the  Stanley  family perhaps to Sir  John Stanley  by  Henry  IV at the same time that he bestowed on him  Hope  and  Hopedale  The earls of  Derby  possessed it till the exe∣cution of earl  James  after which both the manor of  Hope  and  Mold  were purchased by certain persons who enjoyed them till the Restoration after that event a reference was made by his majesty in to the lords respecting the repurchase of those manors by the earl of  Derby  in which it had been agreed by his lordship to pay the parties on the th of  March  the sum of eleven thousand pounds and to be put into full possession of the manors The lords imagined that every thing had been adjusted but the earl of  Derby  refusing to per∣form his part the referrees layed the affair before the king who on the th of  June  ordered that the former purchasers should remain in quiet possession The  Derby  family by some  means regained the lordship of  Hope  but that of  Mold  is at present the property of lady  Vincent  The mineral advantages of the manor which have at times been very considerable are equally divided between her ladyship the  Trevors  and Mr  Lloyd  of  Tyddyn  FROM  Mold  I took the west side of the vale a tract filled with numbers of gentlemen's seats of independent fortunes as yet not caught and absorbed in the gulphy vortex of our  Leviathans  These are the remnants of the custom of gavelkind so prevalent formerly in  North Wales  and which have re∣mained unimproved by those accidents which by time and chance happen to many I digressed a little to the right to see the magnificent gates of  Leeswood  the seat of the late Sir  George Wynne  baronet and a little higher up to  Tower  TOWER  to enjoy the witty the lively and agreeable conversation of the reverend Doctor  William Wynne  now departed This gentleman was one of those who kept the patrimony derived from a long train of an∣cestors without increase yet without impair The house is small but part of it is a true specimen of the borderhouses on the confines of  England  and  Scotland  a square tower of three stories In the lower still remains a staple in the ceiling a memorial of the rudeness of the times During the wars be∣tween the houses of  York  and  Lancaster  this place was inhabited by  Reinallt ap Gryffydd ap Bleddyn  one of the six gallant captains who defended  Harlech  castle on the part of  Henry  VI He and his people were in continual feud with the citizens of  Chester  In a considerable number of the latter came to  Mold  fair a fray ensued between the two parties a dreadful  slaughter was made on both sides but  Reinallt  got the victory took prisoner  Robert Bryne  linendraper and mayor of  Chester  in whom he led to his tower and hung on the staple in his great hall An attempt was made afterwards to seize  Reinallt  and two hundred tall men sallied from  Chester  for that purpose He retired from his house to a neighboring wood permitted part of his enemies to enter the building then rushing from his cover fastened the door and setting fire to the place burnt them with∣out mercy he then attacked the rest pursued them to the seaside where those who escaped the sword perished in the channel His actions were celebrated at the time in poems still extant particularly by  Lewis Glyn Cothi  in an  Awdl  A  Cywydd  and an  Awdl  differ in these respects the first consists of cou∣plets generally of seven syllables the last of stan  as of different lengths of metre somewhat like a  Pindaric  ode  in praise of  Reinallt  It seems  Lewis  had married a widow of  Chester  against the consent of the inhabitants who spoiled him of all his ef∣fects This whetted the poet's satyr  Who summons the ministry of angels and of devils to his assistance and pours a profusion of curses on  Caer Lleon  and its people He wishes water to drown fire to burn and air to infect the hated place and that grass might grow in every part except the sacred edifices of this habitation of the seven deadly sins  THE TOWER in old times was called after the name of this hero It was also named  Bryncoed  from the wood that might have surrounded it In the time of  Leland  it was inhabited by  John Wynn ap Robert  I DESCENDED into my former road and passed along the course of the  Terrig  or the  violent  TERRIG  at this time a trifling brook but often of a tremendous swell and fury On quitting its chan∣nel go by  Leeswood  or  CoedLlai  the antient seat of my worthy relation  Thomas Eyton  esquire The  Davieses  of  Gwasaney  the  Wynnes  of  Tower  and this family sprung from  Kynrig Evell  or  the Twin  son of  Madoc ap Meredydd  prince of lower  Powys  Madoc  died in  He was styled lord of  Eglwyseg  and had beside for his portion  Molesdale  and  Treuddyn  in the parish of  Mold  which by the custom of gavel kind became divided among his posterity part of which these families his descendants still enjoy  FARTHER on is  Hartsheath  the house of  Guillim Wardle  esquire descended by the female line from the  Lloyds  of the same place It is most beautifully seated on a long rising insulated by the vale and finely wooded and cultivated The house stands on the southern extremity and commands a most elegant view of the valley divided by the insulated rock of  Caergwrle  soaring out of the valley and capped with a ruined castle  A LITTLE further up the vale stands  PlâsTêg  PLASTEG  a singular house belonging to the  Trevors  but for numbers of years oc∣cupied by farmers The  Trevors  acquired it by the marriage of  Robert Trevor  of  Brynkinalt  with  Katherine  daughter of  Llewelyn ap Ithel  of the  Mold  and  Plâstêg  It is built with great regularity and simple grandeur In the centre is a hall fortythree feet long by twentythree A spacious staircase and above is a diningroom of the same dimensions with the hall and twelve feet nine inches high At each corner of the house is a square wing or tower  consisting as does the centre of five floors In each is a room twentytwo feet six by nineteen six and within each of these rooms a closet thirteen feet seven inches square  THIS house was built in by Sir  John Trevor  Epitaph in  H  pe  church  a second son of the branch of  Trevalun  The design is attributed to  Inigo Jones  but I doubt the tradition It wants both the  Grecian  gothic ornaments of his worse days and the pure  Grecian  of his best  FROM hence I pursued my journey to  Caergwrle  CAERGWRLE  a village on the banks of the  Alun  in the parish of  Hope  or  Estyn  whose form speaks it to have been a  Roman  station which appears very evident to the antiquarian eye from the summit of the adjacent rock the site of the castle The precincts shew them∣selves to have been rectangular with one side formed by the s  ope along the banks of the river Here is yet preserved the antient disposition in three broad streets running parallel and three narrower intersecting them at right angles It had been only a small place an outpost to  Deva  but had the usual con∣comitants of  Roman  luxury  RO    In  Camden  's time a  hy∣  was discovered near the place five ells long four broad and half an ell high cut out of the live rock The s  oo  was of brick set in mortar the roof supported by brick pillars and consisted of polished tiles perforated on these were laid certain brick tubes which conveyed the heat to the room above On some of those tiles were inbscribed LEGIO XX  Camden  ii  which point out the founders I have also been credibly informed that  Roman  bricks were found in the ruins of the old house of  Hope  the seat of the family of the same name I have also heard that large beds of iron cinders have been discovered near  Caer Estyn  in this parish the supposed works of the  Romans  BESIDES these proofs here is the trace of a  Roman  road pointing from the village towards  Mold  and is visible in two or three places especially in the fields on this side of  Plâstêg  I think that part of the present road was a portion of the  Roman  An artificial mount stands close on its course  ROADS  Another road points towards  Hawarden  which increases my suspicion of that having also been a  Roman  outpost As the word  street  is generally a sign of a  Roman  road there might have been a third on the  Wrexham  side of  Caergwrle  for we find on that road  Croes y street  passing over a place called  Cesn y Bêdd  or the hill of the grave and leading to the castle These roads were one way into some of the mineral parts of  Wales  where  Roman  money had been found  MR EDWARDS makes a happy conjecture respecting the ety∣mology of the name of this place  Caer Gawr Lle  or the camp of the  Giant Legion Lleon Gawr  for the  Britons  bestowed that title on the twentieth legion to imply its power a turn analo∣gous to  Victrix  giving it the strength of a giant  This gave rise to the fable of  Chester  having been built by  Lleon Gawr  a mighty giant See p Mr CAMDEN by mistake calls the legion  Leon Vawr    THIS place in the division of  Wales  by  Roderic  the great formed part of the  Cantref y Rhiw  When the  Saxons  made a con∣quest  of our borders they comprehended it in their hundred called  Exestan  and added it to the county of  Chester  We find in the Doomsday book that  Hope  which gives name to the parish was held at that period by one  Gislebert  before by  Edwevi  a freeman In after times this tract was known by the name of  Hopedale  On the division of  Wales  into counties by  Edward  I it was annexed to  Flintshire  was severed from it and added to  Denbighshire  by  Henry  VIII and in the same reign restored to the former county It is a common notion in the country that the last was effected by the interest of the earl of  Derby  in or∣der to have his  Welsh  estates in the same county for at that time the family was possessed of  Hawarden Molesdale  and this  manor  which had been granted on  January  st by  Henry  IV to Sir  John Stanley  The family had at the same time the lordship of  Maelor Saesneg  which was a portion of  Flintshire  since its first being formed into a county This manor of  Hope  is the only one possessed at present in  Wales  by the earl of  Derby  THE castle of  Caergwrle  stood on the summit of a great rock  CASTLE  precipitous on one side and of steep ascent on the others Some of the walls and part of a round tower still remain suf∣ficient to shew that its size was never great Close to it on the accessible parts it was protected by very deep fosses cut through the rock On the northeast side there is a pretty extensive area and round its verge the vestiges of a rampart of earth and stones and a foss such as usual in the  British  posts it may be therefore supposed that it had been possessed by the  Britons  in early times and that it served to defend in conjunc∣tion  with  Caer Estyn  CAER ESTYN  a  British  post of one rampart and ditch on the opposite side of the dale above the village the entrance through this pass into  Wales  The vale almost closes in this place leaving only room enough for the  Alun  to flow through its picturesque dingles till it gains the open country near the church of  Gresford  I CANNOT trace the founder of this castle  FOUNDER  It probably was one of the few  Welsh  fortresses that we have to boast of Its oblong form its comparative deficiency of towers and its ge∣neral agreement in structure with others whole origin I am ac∣quainted with make me willing to suppose it the work of our countrymen after they had recovered possession of this tract In the reign of  Owen Gwynedd  I find it part of the estates of  Gryffydd Maelor  Powel      DAVID brother to  Llewelyn  last prince of  Wales  held it from  Edward  I  David  made great complaints of the injurious treat∣ment he met with from  Roger de Clifford  the justiciary of  Chester  who cut down his woods about  Hope  and endeavored to dispos∣sess him of his rights  The same  When  David  took up arms in defence of his brother he left a garrison in this castle but in  June  it surrendered to the  English  monarch As soon as it came into his possession he bestowed it with all its apperte∣nances on his beloved consort  Eleonora  AYLOFF'S Rot Walliae  from which it ac∣quired the name of Queen  Hope  The queen lodged here in her way to  Caernarvon  where her husband sent her to give the  Welsh  a ruler born among them Either at this time or soon after the castle was burnt by a casual fire  IN the first of  Edward  II this castle and manor was granted to  John de Cromwell  JOHN DE CROM∣WELL  on condition that he should repair

adjoining to the  Alun  are two springs strongly impregnated with salt  SALT SPRINGS  to which in dry weather used to be a great resort of pigeons to pick up the hardened particles These were formerly resorted to as a remedy in scorbutic cases The patients drank a quart or two in a day and some boiled the water till half was wasted before they took it The effect was purging griping and sickness at the stomach which went off in a few days and then  produced a good appetite Dr  Short  gives an instance of a woman in a deplorable situation from a deep scurvy who was perfectly restored by the use of these springs  FROM the village of  Hope  I returned on the north side of the valley repassed  Mold  and about a mile west of the town visited  MaesGarmon  MAESGARMON  a spot that still retains the name of the saintly commander in the celebrated battle the  Victoria Alleluic∣tica  fought in between the  Britons  headed by the bishops  Germanus  and  Lupus  and a crowd of pagan  Picts  and  Saxons  who were carrying desolation through the country This event hap∣pened in  Easter  week when the Christian army wet with their recent baptism in the river  Alun  were led by their holy com∣manders against the pagan host  Germanus  instructed them to attend to the word he gave and repeat it Accordingly he pro∣nounced that of ALLELUIA His soldiers caught the sacred sound and repeated it with such ecstatic force that the hills resounding with the cry struck terror into the enemy who fled on all sides numbers perished by the sword and numbers in the adjacent river  Brit Eccles Antiquitates  Paulus Diaconus  lib xv c and BEDE lib i c describe the action    SUCH is the relation given by  Constantius  of  Lyons  who wrote the life of St  Germanus  within thirtytwo years after the death of the saint It has been objected by cavillers that the  Saxons  were not at that time possessed of  Britain  That may be admitted but the learned USHER overthrows the objec∣tion by rightly observing that those people had long before  made temporary invasions of our island and committed great ravages in several parts and calls to witness  Ammianus Mar∣cellinus  Lib xxvi c  and to his

river  Alun  like the sullen  Mole  or mourning  Guadiana  sinks under ground and conti∣nues a subterraneous course for half a mile and then emerges to the day About two miles distant from this place lies the church or  Kilken  beneath  Moel Famm    the highest division of the  Clwydian  hills  CLWYDIAN HILLS  These run in a chain from above  Presta  yn  on the estuary of the  Dee  from north to south as far as  Moel Yr accre  in  Llanarmon  parish when they join the  Mountain Cefn du  extending to the parish of  Gwyddelwern  These admit no passage the whole way excepting that of  Bodvari  without climbing the steep sides and going through the  bwlchs  formed high up between the round heathy heads that rise from the mass more than twothirds of the way to the summits and which form from the west side of the vale of  Clwyd  a most beautiful view especially in the season when it glows with the p  rple flowers of the heath A few birds lovers of exalted situations are still to be found here a few black and red grous have escaped the rage of shooters and I have seen the  ring∣euz  about the lower parts These hills are composed of a mixed soil clay and gravel The stone is of a shattery lami∣nated nature and bad for most o  conomic uses The sides abound in springs which descend in small rills to the great be∣nefit of the inhabitants of the rich slopes  THE church of  Kilken  is remarkable for its carved roof  KILLEN CHURCH  which is said to have been brought from the church at  Basingwere  abby on the dissolution and thus to have fulfilled a prophecy of our  Robin Ddu

BRITISH POSTS  is part of a druidical circle and a small  tumulus  On one of the summits of the mountain at a great height above the house is a very strong  British  post with two ditches of prodigious depth with suitable dikes on the accessible sides and on that which is inaccessible is a smooth terras levelled along the hill probably a place for exercising the possessors This post is called  Moel  ARTHUR probably in honor of our celebrated prince  MOEL ARTHUR  This is one of the chain of posts that defended the country of the  Ordovices  and their suc∣cessors against the inroads of invaders They are far from being peculiar to that nation but were the common mode of defence throughout the whole island I conjecture that their origin was very early but that they were occasionally made use of in after times even as low as that of  Owen Glyndwr  Al∣most all are rendered defensible in the same manner by deep ditches and highbanks formed either of earth or of loose stones with one but generally two entrances In the description of that of  Caractacus  by  Tacitus  their formation is exactly shewn  Tunc montibus arduis et si qua clementer accedi poterant in modum  valli saxa praestruit  Taciti  Annales lib xii c  They are of no certain shape but the pre∣cinct conforms to that of the hill  THEIR USES  They are generally destitute of water which evinces that they were not intended as places of long abode but merely temporary retreats for their families herds and flocks on a sudden invasion The fighting men kept the field while all that was dear or valuable was committed to these  asyla  under a proper garrison  THEY are always placed within sight of one another so that by fires or other signals notice might be given of the approach of an enemy  FIRT MOEL HIR∣ADDIG  The first that forms this chain is  Moel Hir∣addig  about two or three miles from the sea on a rocky hill in the parish of  Cwm  Possibly prior to the castle of  Diserth  another post might have been on that rock and in such case should be esteemed the first post the guard of the shore and the great artificial mount above  Newmarket  called  Cop yr Gol∣e  i  or  Mount  of  Light  which

rock de∣fended that front Farther on was  Hawarden  and still farther where the vale of  Cheshire  gains upon our country was that of the  Rosts  in the parish of  Gresford  I could give a long list of these posts perhaps as far as the  Severn  sea in the country of the  Silures  and the  Transs  brine  parts of the  Cornavii  but their suffice for the present purpose I shall endeavor in Mr  a  s  's map to point out the whole of these fastnesses of our di  t  ant ancestors  SOON after passing  Penbedw  NANEERCH  I reached  Nannerch  a hamlet with a small church noted for little but a monument in memory of  Charlot  Theophila Mostyn  wife to  Richard Mostyn  Esq  former owner of  Peabedw  and daughter and coheiress with her si  ter  Magare  ta Maria  who married Sir  John Conway  of  Bediruddan  to  John Digby  son of the famous Sir  Kenelm  by which means se∣veral choice morsels of his collection came into our country  GRATITUDE to the worthy rector of this place the reverend Mr  John Lloyd  for the many informations I received from him respecting the antiquities of our country urges me here to make my best acknowlegements Few possess so large a share of the knowlege of our language and of our history and few have been so liberal in the communication  THIS valley is a boundary of the mineral tract of our county  MINERAL TRACT  I shall now take a kind of bird's eye view of the whole which I surrounded beginning with the northern extremity The highland part may be divided into two  FIRST DIVISION  The first is insulated by valley plain and sea The farther point is  Dalar Goch  or the rock of  Diserth  bounded by the rich arable slats of  Rud∣land  the course is continued southward through the parishes of  Cwm Dimeirchion  and  Caerwys  bounded by the vale of  Clwyd  and that of  Bodvari  The parishes of  Ysgeiviog  and  Nannerch  succeed and after them a portion of  Kilken  when this mineral tract takes a turn above the parish of  Mold  at  Rhos Esmor  in that of  Nor∣thop  and then faces the east in the parishes of  Halkin  and  Holy∣well  in those of  Whiteford Llanasa Gwaenyskar  and  Meliden  and makes a point towards the west where it unites with the rock of  Diserth  THE second division is separated from the first by a deep de∣pression of the country between  Rhos Esmor  SECOND DIVISION  and the parish of  Mold  There is even in the lower parts on the west side a chain of mines But the land rises again at  Mold  mountain and the mineral tract is continued through the parishes of  Llanverres  the eastern sides of  Llanarmon Llandegla  the  Glisseg  rocks and  Minera  above  Wrexham  THE middle of the first division is entirely limestone as is the western side from  Dalar goch  to  Rhos Esmor  from thence or on the eastern side the strata alters  LIMESTONE  Towards the skirts of the hills  CHERT  it changes to that flinty substance called  chert  more or less pure  SHALE  Lower down it degenerates into shale of a black stone soon dissoluble in the air So far leadore is found Sy  after this strata freestone commences  FREESTONE  and coals are found which continue to the shore and under the sea till they appear on the opposite side in the peninsula of  Wiral  and again be∣yond the estuary of the  Mersey  THE same observations might be made on the  strata  in the se∣cond division Limestone beds are continued on the western side beyond the  Gliseg  rocks and in their neighborhood on both sides of the  Dee  The veins in  Minera  lie in an impure gritty chert The sudden change of  Strata  is very observable The transition may be immediately seen on each side of the narrow vale of  Nannerch  limestone forming the one and the shattery slaty stone composing the other  WAS I to continue my aerial speculation I should see a dis∣continuance of the limestone  strata  till they rose on the opposite side of the vale of  Clwyd  My eye would catch the most remote part on the northern side of  Red Wharfbay  in  Anglesea  insulated far from any other The great promontories of  Llandudus  and  Rhiwledin  or the greater and lesser  Ormshead  the first at times rich in copper would next appear  Penmaen Rhos  and the continued precipices along the coast of  Denbighshire  succeed in the nearer view many of them productive of lead ore And finally the detatched rocks of  Henllan  beyond  Denbigh  and  Coed Marchon  beyond  Ruthyn  which yield to the industrious farmer by their excellent lime a manure more certainly pro∣ductive of wealth than the precarious search after the deephid minerals  THE limestone and the chert of our mineral tracts are of unknown depth neither their bottom nor that of the fissars or veins which cross them have ever been discovered  DEPTH OF VEINS  The ore of lead has been followed to the depth of a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty yards and then has ceased but the unprofitable vein appears below unclosed Our mines as I have shewn before have been worked from very early times  P  but not without long interruptions But as several of our veins have been pursued for a hundred years past the point may be affirmed of the depth to which they bear ore in our coun∣try  THE veins run either north and south or east and west  THEIR COURSE  But it is remarkable that the lead ore got in the first scarcely ever produces a quantity of silver worth the refiner's labor The ores of  Mold  mountain and  Minera  yield scarcely any silver  THE minerals of the tracts in question are ore of lead ca∣lamine or  Lapis calaminaris  and a mineral that answers the same purpose called by the miners  black jack  OUR ores of lead differ in quality The lamellated  ORES OF LEAD THEIR PRODUCE OF LEAD  or com∣mon kind usually named  potters ore  yields from fourteen to sixteen hundred and a quarter of lead from twenty hundred of the ore but the last produce is rare  THE quantity of silver produced from our lead is also va∣riable  OF SILVER  The upper part of a vein of lead ore is always richest in silver the bottom in lead Our refiners will assay any lead that will yield ten ounces in the ton of lead and upwards The usual produce is fourteen ounces sixteen have been gotten but acquisitions of that kind within this circuit are extremely uncommon  SOME years ago a green lead ore was discovered in the  silver  rake on  Halkin  mountain  GREEN LEADORE  Only a small quantity was found which yielded about thirteen hundred and a quarter from a tun of the ore It was of a very stubborn quality and resisted the greatest powers of the blast furnace before it would yield any metal  THE brown or whitish stoney species of ore called  Caulk  BROWN OR CAULK  pro∣duce from five hundred and a quarter to eleven hundred of lead from the ton The smelters likewise get from what is called  waste  or the hillocks which are the refuse of good ores so mixed with clay gravel stone or calamine as not to be separated but by fire from ten to thirteen hundred of lead per ton  WE have had at different periods mines productive of vast wealth in several parts of this tract  RICH MINES  The richest vein was dis∣covered about fifty years ago at  Rowley  's rake or  Pant y Pwll dwr  on  Halkin  mountain continued with some interruption into a small inclosure the property of Sir  George Wynne  of  Leeswood  and the freehold of Mr  David Hughes  which in less than thirty years yielded to different proprietors adventurers and smelters above a million of money The reader will naturally expect to find in these parts a nation of  Craesus  's but  citò parta  citò dilabuntur  It is at this time an undetermined question whether more wealth has been gotten out of the earth or more lost in the search after the prizes in this subterraneous lottery  MUCH of the ore obtained in our country is smelted in the several furnaces belonging to different companies much also is exported in the form of ore I wished to be acquainted with the annual quantity smelted from those of the country but found by reason of the ores imported from  Scotland  and other parts that the computation would be of insuperable difficulty All the lead and ore is exported from the port of  Chester  a small quantity excepted consumed by the plumbers and other trades in the adjacent parts I therefore refer the reader to pages for the number of tuns sent from that port in the years By the favor of Mr  Jken  collector I am per∣mitted to say that from the year to  Christmas  the following quantities have been entered in the customhouse fo∣reign and coastways  Lead    Tons    c    qrs    lb    Lead ore    T    c    Litharge    T    c  I CANNOT ascertain the quantity of ounces of silver produced from our ores for the reasons just assigned I can only say that the company of a single smeltinghouse did obtain in the  Year    Oz    Oz    Oz  In  Oz    Oz    Oz  THE reader need not be told that the former were the years of mineral plenty and such which I must say are seldom known There are five other smelting houses but I believe none equalled this in the quality of silver This precious metal is chiefly bought by the artificers at  Sheffield  and  Birmingham  CALAMINE is found in great abundance in the veins of lime∣stone and chert in the same manner as the ores of lead Where there is plenty of the former there is little or none of the lat∣ter The calamine is also entirely confined to the eastern side of the country About a thousand tons of this mineral is an∣nually exported I have mentioned in p how little it was known in  Flintshire  till within these sixty years and may here add that we were indebted to  John Barrow  a native of  Somerset∣shire  who being well acquainted with that mineral in his own country pointed out to us its uses  CALAMINE assumes various shapes and colors Green yellow red and black often has a stony appearance and often like the lattice work of bones The richest looks like beeswax but that species is not common any more than the curious cry∣stallized specimens  THE ores of  Zink  called here  black jack  are met with in our mines We have it in a metallic form of a bluish grey color  and again in form of the dark semipellucid ambers  Cromsted  calls the first ZINCUM  ferro sulphurato mineralisatum  the other ZINCUM  calciforme cum ferro sulphuratum  N  o    a  THESE were engrossed by patent by a  Bristol  company and

never infest our mines except in form of damps of both species the  suffocating  and the  fire  The last is very frequent in the coalpits but rare in the mines of lead unless in those parts where the  shale  begins or stone attendant on coal The first kills instantaneously by its  mephitic  vapor and is a disaster com∣mon to neglected vaults and drawwells The other is inflam∣mable  and burns and destroys in a dreadful manner  FIREDAMP  as the colliers through negligence in not setting fire to the vapor be∣fore it gets to a head do often experience The most tremen∣dous instance was on  February  d in a coalwork at  Mos∣tyn  which I shall relate from the  Philosophical Transactions  N  o  or Vol ii  Lowthorb  's Abridgement The account was drawn up by Mr  Roger Mostyn  and so conclude the account of our mineral concerns  The damp had been perceived for some time before  IN MOSTYN COLLIERY  resem∣bling fiery blades darting and crossing each other from both sides of the pit The usual methods were taken to free the pit from this evil After a cessation of work for three days the steward thinking to fetch a compass about from the eye of the pit that came from the day and to bring wind by a secure way along with him that if it burst again it might be done without danger of men's lives went down and took two men along with him which served his turn for this purpose He was no sooner down but the rest of the work∣men that had wrought there disdaining to be left behind in such a time of danger hasted down after them and one of them more indiscreet than the rest went headlong with his candle over the eye of the damppit at which the damp im∣mediately catched and flew to and fro over all the hollows of the work with a great wind and a continual fire and as it went keeping a mighty great roaring noise on all sides  THE men at first appearance of it had most of them fallen upon their faces and hid themselves as well as they could in  the loose slack or smallcoal and under the shelter of posts yet nevertheless the damp returning out of the hollows and drawing towards the eye of the pit it came up with incredible force the wind and fire tore most of their clothes off their backs and singed what was left burning their hair faces and hands the blasts falling so sharp on their skin as if they had been whipt with cords Some that had lest shelter were carried fifteen or sixteen yards from their first station and beaten against the roof of the coal and sides of the post and lay afterwards a good while senseless so that it was long be∣fore they could hear or find one another As it drew up to the daypit it caught one of the men along with it that was next to the eye and up it comes with such a terrible crack not unlike but more shrill than a cannon that was heard fif∣teen miles off with the wind and such a pillar of smoak as darkened all the sky overhead for a good while The brow of the hill above the pit was eighteen yards high and on it grew trees of fourteen or fifteen yards long yet the man's body and other things from the pit were seen above the tops of the highest trees at least yards On this pit stood a horseengine of substantial timber and strong iron work on which lay a trunk or barrel for winding the rope up and down of above pounds weight it was then in motion one bucket going down and the other coming up full of wa∣ter This trunk was fastened to that frame with locks and bolts of iron yet it was thrown up and carried a good way from the pit and pieces of it though bound with ironhoops and strong nails blown into the woods about so likewise were  the two buckets and the ends of the rope after the buckets were blown from them stood a while upright in the air like pikes and then came leisurely drilling down The whole frame of the engine was stirred and moved out of its place and those mens clothes caps and hats that escaped were afterwards found shattered to pieces and thrown amongst the woods a great way from the pit  FROM  Nannerch  I continued my journey along the narrow vale picturesquely ornamented with hanging woods Leave the church of  Skeiviog  on the right In this parish was shot a few years ago  HOOPOE  that singular bird the  Hoopoe  vol i N  o  of  British Zoology  This species is of the size of a  stare  easily dis∣tinguishable by its large crest long slender incurvated bill and by having only ten feathers in the tail I can add to my former account that the  Arabs  call it the  messenger bird  not only from the resemblance which the crest bears to the plumes that decorate the caps of  Chaous  or  Turkish  messengers but also be∣cause the  Mahometans  believe it to have been the bird which when birds could speak held a conversation with  Solomon  and to have been the courier which carried on the epistolary correspon∣dence between that wise monarch and the  Sabaean  queen  Bochart Hitroz  pars ii p Also Universal antient Hist iv notes    AT the junction of the vales of  Nannerch  and  Bodvari  I as∣cended to  Caerwys  CAERWYS  a town mouldering away with age It consists of four streets crossing each other at right angles an∣swering to the four points of the compass The name as  Camden  has long since observed savors of great antiquity  Caer  the fortress and  Gwŷs  a summon which shews it had been in early times the place of judicature and it certainly had that honor long before it was removed to the countytown of  Flint  I will not assert that it had been a  Roman  station notwithstanding I am credibly informed that in the present century a number of copper coins were found in a bottom below the town and there still remains in the parish a Latin inscription cut in rude letters on an unhewn upright stone to this effect HIC JACIT MULI ERBO OBIIT Multitudes of  tumuli  are scattered over the neighborhood and one very near to it This plain probably had been a field of bat∣tle Whether this inscription referred to any heroine that fell on this place I will not dare to affirm It is an unfinish∣ed piece  Hic jacit mulier  BOand at a distance the word  obiit  CAERWYS  Powel    with a neighboring town now lost called  Tref Edwyn  and  Rhuddlan  had been from very early time the seats of the judicature for these parts of  Wales  In the noble∣men of  Tegengl  layed before the archbishop of  Canterbury  who came down on the Christian design of reconciling the differ∣ences between  Edward  I and  Llewelyn  the infringement of their liberties in this particular asserting that it was the tenor of their privilege to be judged according to the laws of  Wales  at those three places and that the best men of the country were taken because they desired to be judged at  Tref Edwyn  by the laws of  Wales  Ibid  How far their complaints were remedied does  not appear but when justiciary courts were in after times ap∣pointed  Caerwys  recovered its antient honors In this town were held the great sessions It had its townhall and its jail and was the place of execution It remained the place of ju∣dicature till sometime past the middle of the last century when the courts were removed to  Flint  IN the year or the th of  Henry  III that prince granted to the inhabitants of  Tegengl  a charter  Mostyn  MSS  exempting them from the  amobr  but at the same time imposes on them an obliga∣tion to find twentyfour people who were to keep the peace of the country and obliges this town  Picton Axton  and other hamlets to find three men each to work three days in the harvest as they were wont in the days of the two preceding  Welsh  princes This seems during some temporary advantage which  Henry  had over the  Welsh  CAERWYS has the most considerable fairs for cattle sheep and horses in all the county They are of great antiquity

 is lord of this manor and possesses by purchase of an ancestor the estate of the  Griffiths  descended from  EdnowenBendew  one of the fifteen tribes whose seat is still standing inhabited by tenants  BUT what gave a particular glory to the town of  Caerwys  was the honor it had of being the place of the  Eisteddfod  or the  sessions of the bards and minstrels for many centuries It was the resort of those of a certain district as  Aberfraw  in  Anglesea  was of those of that island and the neighboring county and  Mathraval  of those of the land of  Powys  The reason that these places were thus distinguished was because the two last were the residence of princes and  Caerwys  on account of the royal palace that stood below the town the residence of  Llewelyn ap Gryffydd  THESE  Eisteddfods  were the  British Olympics  Fired at first with generous emulation our poets crowded into the list and carried off the prize contented with the mere honor of vic∣tory At length when the competitors became numerous and the country became oppressed with the multitude new regula∣tions of course took place The disappointed candidates were no longer suffered to torture the ears of the principality with their wretched compositions None but bards of merit were suffered to rehearse their pieces and minstrels of skill to perform These went through a long probation judges were appointed to decide on their respective abilities and degrees suitable were conferred and permissions granted for exercising their ta∣lents in the manner that will be related in the following pages The judges were appointed by commission from our princes and after the conquest of  Wales  by the kings of  England  notwithstanding  Edward  I exercised a political cruelty over the generation of bards of his time yet future princes thought fit to revive an institution so likely to soften the manners of a fierce people The crown had the power of nominating the judges who decided not only on the merit but the subject of  the poems and like our modern lord chamberlains were cer∣tain of licensing only those which were agreeable to the  English  court  BEFORE I enter on the account of the succession of  British Eisteddsfods  I shall just mention the high antiquity of the cha∣racter that made  ANTIENT BARDS  in after times the principal figure in these meetings The  Bardi  the  Beirdds  of the  Britons  were of great authority among the  Celtic  nations the  Germans  were animated in battle by verses delivered in a deep and solemn tone  Tacitus  de mor German lib vi  among the  Gauls  Strabo  lib iv  Athenaeus  they sung the actions of great men and particularly celebrated in their hymns the heroes who fell in fight  Vos quoque qui fortes animas belloque peremtas  Laudibus in longum vates dimittis in aevum  Plurima fecuri fudistis carmina BARDI  LUCAN i  YOU too ye bards whom sacred rapture fire  To chaunt your heroes to your country's lyre  Who consecrate in your immortal strain  Brave patriot souls in righteous battle slain  Securely now the tuneful task renew  And noblest themes in deathless songs pursue  ROWE  IT is highly probable that the bards and minstrels were under certain regulations during the time of  Druidism  but we find no  proofs of them till long after  IN TIME OF CAP∣WALADR  till the days of  Cadwaladr  last king of  Britain  who died at  Rome  about the year Of him it is said that being at an assembly of this nature with his nobles there came a minstrel and played in a key so displeasing that he and all his brethren were prohibited under a severe pe∣nalty from ever playing on it any more but were ordered to adopt that of  Mwynen Gwynedd  or the sweet key of Gwy∣nedd  North Wales    I IMAGINE  OF ARTHUR  that previous to this there had been musical re∣gulations in  Britain  for I find that a tune called  Gosteg yr Halen  or the  Prelude of the Salt  was always played whenever the saltseller was placed before king  Arthur  's knights at his round table  Mr  Morris  's MSS of  British  music    AFTER  Cadwaladr  the next princes who undertook the re∣form of our minstrelsie were  Bleddyn ap Cynfyn  and  Gryssydd ap Cynan  OF GRYFFYDD AP CYNAN  The first was cotemporary with the conqueror the last with king  Stephen  These enacted that no person should follow the  profession  of bard or minstrel but such only who were admitted by the  Eisteddfod  which was held once in three years They were prohibited from invading one another's province nor were they permitted to degrade themselves by following any  other  occupation Neither of these were to demand above ten shillings in any article under pain of losing the whole besides being suspended from their profession for three years  Leges Wallieae      AFTER the times of the princes the great men their descen∣dants took these people under their care and protection allow∣ing  them the liberty of circuiting their respective territories thrice a year viz at  Christmas Easter  and  Whitsuntide  and the whole principality once in three years  THE bards were in the highest repute I cannot give a strong∣er idea of the esteem they were in than by citing from the  Welsh  laws the account of their rank in the prince's court and the various rewards and fees they were entitled to and the severe penalties that were enacted to preserve their persons from insult They were supposed to be endowed with powers equal to inspi∣ration They were the oral historians of all past transactions public and private They related the great events of the state and like the  scalds  of the northern nations retained the memo∣ry of numberless transactions which otherwise would have pe∣rished in oblivion They were likewise thoroughly acquainted with the works of the three primary bards  viz  MYRDDYN AP MORFRYN MYRDDYN EMRYS and TALIESIN BEN BEIRDD But they had another talent which probably endeared them more than all the rest to the  Welsh  nobility that of being most accom∣plished genealogists and flattering their vanity in singing the deeds of an ancestry derived from the most distant period  THE BARDD TEULU or COURT BARD held the eighth place in the prince's court He possessed his land free The prince supplied him with a horse and woollen robe and the princess with linen  Leges Wallicae  He sat next to the governor of the palace at the three great festivals for at those seasons the governor was to deliver him his harp  The same and  On the same festivals he was also to  have the  Disdain  's or steward of the houshold's garment for his f  e  WHEN a song is called for the  Cadeirfardd  or the bard who has got the  badge of the chair  is first to sing a hymn in glory of GOD after that another in honor of the prince When those are over the  Teuluwr  or bard of the hall is to sing some other subject  IF the princess calls for a song after she has retired from table to her apartment the  Teuluwr  must sing to her highness in a low voice least he should disturb the performers in the hall  John Dafydd Rhys  says that the subject was to be on death but I rather follow  Wotton  who instead of  angau  which signifies  death  prefers the word  amgen  or a  separate subject  from what was sung in the hall  WHEN the bard goes with the prince's servants on a plun∣dering expedition and performs before them his animating com∣positions he is to have the finest heifer of the booty and in case the detachment was drawn up in order of battle he was to sing at their head the  praises of the  British  monarchy  This was to remind them of their antient right to the whole kingdom for their inroads being almost always on the  English  territories they thought they did no more than seize on their own  THE prince bestowed on him an ivory chessboard others say a harp and the princess a golden ring His lodging was to be with the governor of the palace  WHEN he is required to sing with other bards by way of distinction he is to have a double portion  IF the bard asks any favor of the prince he must sing one of his compositions if of a nobleman three if of a common person he must sing till he is so weary as to rest on his elbow or to fall asleep This I fear shews our bards were a very impor∣tuning race and required a check yet still they were in high estimation Their  Gwerth  or compensation for their life was rated at cxxvi cows  leges Wallicae  and any injury done them at vi cows and cxx pence  THE  MerchGobr  of his daughter  MERCHGOBR  or marriage fine of his daughter was cxx pence Her  cowyll argyffreu  or nuptial pre∣sents was thirty shillings and her portion three pounds  Ibid  It is remarkable that the PENCERDD GWLAD or chief of the fa∣culty was entitled to the  merchgobr  or  amobr  for the daughters of all the inferiors of the faculty within the district who payed xxiv pence on their marriage which not only shews the anti∣quity but the great authority of these people  THE PENCERDD was not among the  Ibid  officers of the court but occasionally sat in the tenth place He also had his land free was to perform much in the same manner as the court bard whom he seems to have taken place of whenever he attended for when the  Pencerdd  was present the former sat only in the twelfth seat No other was to play without li∣cense from him His death was valued at cxxvi cows and any injury done him at vi cows and cxx pence Each of the chief musicians was to receive from their lord the first  a harp the second a  crwth  the third a pipe which on their deaths were to revert to the lord  Leges Wallicae    THE prince's harp was valued at cxx pence and that of  Pen∣cerdd  at the same the key at xxiv pence a gentleman's harp was estimated at lx pence  POWEL    says that  Gryffydd ap Cynan  brought over with him out of  Ireland  divers cunning musicians who devised in a man∣ner all the instrumental music now used With all respect to our sister kingdom I must imagine that if our instruments were not originally  British  we were copyists from the  Ro∣mans  who again took their instruments from the  Greeks  Me∣thinks I see the model of a harp in fig tab lxxvi of the supplement of  Montfaucon

ignoble performers they were not allowed to sit down and had only a penny for their pains  THE different degrees were comprehended in this list There were four in the poetical and five in the musical faculty The lowest or more properly what should be called a candidate or probationer was  Y Dyscybl Yspâs  or the  lowest disciple  who was obliged if a candidate for poetry to understand the con∣traction or five species of  Englyns  and to compose them before a  Pencerdd  who was to declare upon his conscience that he was endowed with a true poetical genius After this he com∣menced  DYSCYBL DYSCYBLAIDD  Discipulus disciplinabilis  here he becomes a graduate but must understand twelve of our dif∣ferent metres and produce specimens of each of his own com∣position and if in three years time he does not by his me∣rit acquire the next degree he is degraded from this If he succeeds he then proceeds to the degree of  DYSCYBL PENCEIRDDIAIDD or candidate for degree of  Pencerdd  when he must understand the propriety of expressions and the different metres and compose in twentyone species and if in three years he does not attain by his own merit to the next de∣gree he falls back into that of  Dyscybl dyscyblaidd  otherwise he becomes a  PENBARDD or PENCERDD chief of the faculty he was can∣didate in when it is necessary he should be accomplished in every branch of his art He then received the badge of the  silverharp or that of a golden or silver chain which he wore upon his shoulder He also was placed with much ceremony on a magnificent chair part of the  furnyture  mentioned in the pa∣tent was there invested with his degree and then acquired the honorable name of  Cadeirfardd  or  Bardd cadeiriawg  IN instrumental music there were five degrees which differ nothing from those in the other faculty except in the two lowest I the  Dyscybl yspas heb râdd  or without a degree  Dyscybl yspas graddawl  or graduated  Dyscybl dyscyblaidd    Dyscybl pen∣ceirddiaidd    Pencerdd  These like the others were to be at∣tained by their respective merits in the science but as then qua∣lifications are expressed in technical terms of  British  music it is past my skill to give an explanation None but a  Pencerdd  should presume to become an instructor The chief of our days is that uncommon genius the blind Mr JOHN PARRY of RHIWABON who has had the kingdom for his  Cylch clera  or musical circuit and remains unrivalled  OUR PENCERDDS thus qualified were licensed to sing or to perform under certain restrictions By the law of our princes particular regard was paid to their morals  They were to be no makebates no vagabonds no alehouse haunters no drunkards no brawllers no whorehunters no theeves nor companions of such in which things if they offend everie man by the statute is made an officer and authorized to ar∣rest and punish them yea and to take from them all that they have about them  Powel    THEY were prohibited from uttering any scandalous words in speech or whispers detraction mocking scoffing inventing lies or repeating them after others under pain of fine and im∣prisonment nor were they to make a song of any person with∣out his consent nor to enter any man's house without formal leave first obtained  EVERY  Penbardd  and  Pencerdd  was allowed to take in dis∣ciples for a certain space of time but not above one at a time A disciple was not qualified to make another Each was to be with his teacher during  Lent  unless prevented by sickness or imprisonment under pain of losing his degree He was obliged to shew every composition to his teacher before it was publicly sung They were not to follow the practice of  cl̄er y dom  i e dunghill bards and musicians or any other species of vagabond minstrels They were enjoined a month before each festival to settle their routs with their respective teachers least too many of them should crowd to the same places only one being al∣lowed to go to a person who paid ten pounds a year rent and two to such who payed twenty pounds and so on in proportion to those of higher rank and every teacher was obliged to keep a copy of these rules to shew and inculcate to his pupils in time of  Lent  when they came for their instructions  No person was to mimic mock or scoff at the  awenyddion  on account of their mental absence or when they had on them the AWEN or  poeticus furor  from an opinion that no bard duly authorized could ever meditate on improper subjects  To whatsoever house they came in the time of wakes they must remain there while the feasting lasted unless they had leave  from the master of the house or were invited by another If they wandered from house to house they were to be apprehended as strollers and vagabonds and to be deprived of their  clera  Or their pay Sometimes it signifies the act of their perambulation  which was forfeited to the use of the church If they got in∣toxicated they forfeited their reward but if they violated the chastity of wife or maid they were fined and imprisoned and lost their  clera  for seven years  THEIR fees or rewards were regulated  A dyscybl dyscyblaidd  was entitled to  s    d  for his  cowydd  A DYSCYBL PENCEIRDDIAIDD received for the same species of composition  s    d  His teacher or the  Pencerdd  had no more only the master of the house usually presented him with a garment or some other mark of favor  THE minstrels received these rewards a  dyscybl yspas graddawl  had only  s  upon each of the great festivals  A DYSCYBL DYSCYBLAIDD at the same seasons  s  and a  dyscybl penceirddiaidd    s    d  A PENCERDD the same besides a voluntary gratuity He was also entitled to fees at royal and other weddings and upon their  cylch clera  which was permitted only once in three years But besides these fees in order to encourage the  clerwyr  to keep up the language and the memory of the exploits and pedigrees of the  Britons  they were allowed a penny out of every plough∣land and a halfpenny out of every half ploughland of their district  THE  Penbardd  and  Pencerdd  in their circuits frequented only the houses of the gentry but if he degraded himself by visiting the commonalty he was only to expect the fee of a com∣mon  clerwr  whose province it was to visit the  plebeian  houses The following were the persons who were allotted to entertain the vulgar ears  A PERSON laboring under any infirmity such as blindness lameness  c  a  dyscybl yspas  a  dyscybl dyscyblaidd  and  dyscybl pen∣ceirddiaidd  The first regulation was founded on humanity  No public festivity great feast or wedding could be duly solemnized without the presence of the bards and minstrels A glorious emulation arose among them and prizes were bestowed on the most worthy In the lord  Rhys  prince of  South Wales  made a great feast  Powel  at  Christmas  on account of the finish∣ing his new castle at  Aberteifi  of which he proclamed notice through all  Britain  a year and a day before great was the resort of strangers who were nobly entertained so that none departed unsatisfied Among deeds of arms and variety of  spectacles  RHYS invited all the bards of  Wales  and provided  chairs  for them which were placed in his hall where they fat and dis∣puted and sang to shew their skill in their respective faculties and bestowed great rewards and rich gifts on the victors The bards of  North Wales  won the prizes but the minstrels of  Rhys  's houshold excelled in their faculty On this occasion the  Brawdwr Llys  or  judge of the court  an officer fifth in rank declared aloud the victor and received from the bard for his fee a mighty  drinkinghorn made of the horn of an ox a golden ring and the cushion on which he sat in his chair of dignity  Leges Wellicae    THE bards of those times often accompanied their voices with the harp as they were wont of old in the manner described by  Ammianus Marcellinus  Lib xv  There was also another species of musi∣cian of an inferior kind called  Datceiniad  who accompanied the musical instruments of others with his song He was infe∣rior to both bard and minstrel yet it was requisite he should be possessed of a considerable degree of knowledge in both sci∣ences he ought to be able to tune the harp and  crwth  to shew his skill in playing several notes and keys and to be perfectly conversant in what are called the twentyfour measures of instru∣mental song and to be able to sing with judgment and melody He was likewise to be master of reading justly and writing correctly He was not only to understand the twenty∣four modes of metrical compositions but to exhibit specimens of his own at left in three of them and if he met with any old song faultily transcribed he was to rectify it He was also to carry with him a harp or a  crwth  in a white case He was further required not only to be a ready waiter at table but to be an expert carver of every species of fowl At the weddings of any of the royal family his office was to wait on the bride  ON those occasions I am reminded of another custom in which the bards were concerned After their nuptial feast a  Pencerdd  was constituted CYFF CLER or  pillar of the clêr  and  seated in a chair surrounded by the other bards standing who made him the subject of their merry and ludicrous compositions to raise mirth in the company He was that day to make no reply but on the next he was to divert the hall at the ex∣pence of the inferior bards and was also to compose a poem upon a subject given him suitable to his dignity  THE most inferior of the musical tribe was sometimes admit∣ted  DATCEINIAD  This was the  Datceiniad pen pastwn  or he that sung to the sound of his club being ignorant of every other kind of in∣strument When he was permitted to be introduced he was obliged to stand in the middle of the hall and sing his  cowydd  or  awdl  beating time and playing the symphony with his  pastwn  or club but if there was a professor of music present his leave must be first obtained before he presumed to entertain the company with this species of melody Wherever he came he must act as a menial servant to the bard or musician  Several parts of this account are translated from  Cambrobrytannicae Cymra∣ecaeve Linguae Institutiones  a very rare book written by Doctor  John Davydd Rhys  of  Llanfaethlu  in  Anglesey  printed in He took his doctor's degree at  Sienna  but was educated at  Oxford  He returned to his own country where he practised with great success At the request of Sir  Edward Stradling  of St  Donats  he composed this book He tells us he wrote the first part at Mr  Morgan Meredydd  's in  Radnorshire  the rest at a place of his own in  Breck∣nockshire  as he says at the age of seventy and under the shade of a hawthorn grove  Vide  his preface    I SHALL conclude this account of the  Eisteddfods  and my Tour with the description of the poetical genius of the  Welsh  by  Michael Drayton  POLY OLBION song iv  who elegantly and faithfully records the various personages concerned in the entertainments  ''Mongst whom some there were bards that in their sacred rage  'Recorded the descents and acts of every age  'Some with their nimble joints that struck the warbling string  'In fingering some unskill'd but us'd to sing  'To others harp of which you both might find  'Great plenty and of both excelling in their kind  'That as the  Stethon  ost obtain'd a victor's praise  'Had won the silver harp and worn  Apollo  's bays  'Whose verses they deduc'd from those first golden times  'Of

other some  'In  owdells  theirs express as matter haps to come  'So varying still their moods observing yet in all  'Their quantities their rests their ceasutes metrical  'For to that sacred art they

the native  Irish  who served in  England  in the royal army during the civil wars happened at this place Prince  Rupert  in one of his marches across this country halted at  Ellesmere  and determined by retaliation to revenge the deaths of the  Irish  sufferers thir∣teen  of that kingdom had lately been executed by the parle∣ment army in cool blood Here the prince ordered the prisoners whom he had in possession to cast lots for their lives on the drumhead and the thirteen on whom the fatal destiny fell to be hanged The die was cast and the unfortunate men se∣lected While preparation was making for their execution one of them  Philip Littleton  who had been parkkeeper to  Robert Corbet  Esq  of  Stanwardine  saw Sir  Vincent Corbet  of  Moreton Corbet  ride by who was in the prince's army  Littleton  told a soldier that he was sure if Sir  Vincent  knew he was there he would intercede for him The soldier with great humanity ran to the knight and informed him of the case who immedi∣ately obtained his pardon The rest were executed and after this no more  Irish  were put to death in this kingdom  Communicated from a MS by the reverend Mr  Edwards  THE  Kynastons  are of  Welsh  descent

young man named  George Cranage  went with his hatchet and cut down the chains of the drawbridge The parlement forces then entered and obliged the royalists to retire into the castle  Cranage  was then persuaded to hang a  buttar petard  at the castle gate After being well animated with sack he under∣took this desperate attempt crept with the engine from house to house till he got to that next
