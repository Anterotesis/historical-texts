Tragedy emboldens me to lay it now at your Feet and beg your Permission to publish it under your Royal Patronage The Favouring and Protecting of Letters has been in all Ages and Countries one distinguishing Mark of a great Prince and That with good reason not only as it shews a Justness of Taste and Elevation of Mind but as  the Influence of such a Protection by exciting good Writers to labour with more Emulation in the Improvement of their several Talents not a little contributes to the Embellishment and Instruction of Society But of all the different Species of Writing none has such an Effect upon the Lives and Manners of Men as the Dramatick and therefore That of all others most deserves the Attention of Princes who by a judicious Approbation of such Pieces as tend to promote all Publick and Private Virtue may more than by any coercive Methods secure the Purity of the Stage and in consequence thereof greatly advance the Morals and Politeness of their People How eminently YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS has always extended your Favour and Patronage to every Art and Science and in a particular Manner to Dramatick Performances is too well known to the World for me to mention it here Allow me only to wish that what I have now the Honour to offer your  ROYAL HIGHNESS may be judged not unworthy of your Protection at least in the  Sentiments  which it inculcates A warm and grateful Sense of your Goodness to me makes me desirous to seize every Occasion of declaring in Publick with what profound Respect and dutiful Attachment I am  SIR    Your ROYAL HIGHNESS'S

touches his last Moments  LAURA  So 'tis fear'd  SIGISMUNDA  The Death of those distinguish'd by their Station  But by their Virtue more awakes the Mind  To solemn Dread and strikes a saddening Awe  Not that we grieve for them but for ourselves  Left to the Toil of LifeAnd yet the Best  Are by the playful Children of this World  At once forgot as they had never been  LAURA 'tis saidthe Heart is sometimes charg'd  With a prophetick Sadness Such methinks  Now hangs on mine The King's approaching Death  Suggests a thousand Fears What Troubles thence  May throw the State once more into Confusion  What sudden Changes in my Father's House  May rise and part me from my dearest TANCRED  Alarms my Thought  LAURA  The Fears of Lovesick Fancy  Perversely busy to torment it self  But be assur'd your

lies was call'd in haste  He sent each way his Messengers to find him  With such a Look of Ardor and Impatience  As if this near Event was to Count TANCRED  Of more Importance than I comprehend  SIGISMUNDA  There lies my LAURA o'er my TANCRED'S Birth  A Cloud I cannot pierce With princely Cost  Nay with Respect which oft I have observ'd  Stealing at times submissive o'er his Features  In  Belmont's  Woods my Father rear'd this Youth  Ah Woods where first my artless Bosom learnt  The Sighs of LoveHe gives him out the Son  Of an old Friend a Baron of  Apulia    Who in the late Crusado b avely fell  But then 'tis strange is all his Family  As well as Father dead and all their Friends  Except my Sire the generous good SIFFREDI  Had he a Mother Sister Brother left  The last Remain of

 LAURA  No SIGISMUNDA 'tis the strictest Truth  Nor half the Truth I tell you Even with Fondness  My Brother talks for ever of the Passion  That fires young TANCRED'S Breast So much it strikes him  He praises Love as if he were a Lover  He blames the false Pursuits of vagrant Youth  Calls them gay Folly a mistaken Struggle  Against bestjudging Nature Heaven he says  In lavish Bounty form'd the Heart for Love  In Love included all the finer Seeds  Of Honour Virtue Friendship purest Bliss  SIGISMUNDA  Virtuous RODOLPHO  LAURA  Then his pleasing Theme  He varies to the Praises of your Lover  SIGISMUNDA  And what my LAURA says he on that Subject  LAURA  He says that tho' he were not nobly born  Nature has form'd him noble generous brave  Truely magnanimous and warmly scorning  Whatever bears the smallest Taint of Baseness  That every easy Virtue is his own  Not learnt by painful Labour but inspir'd  Implanted in his SoulChiefly one Charm  He in his graceful Character observes  That tho' his Passions burn with high Impatience  And sometimes from a noble Heat of Nature  Are ready to fly off yet the least Check  Of ruling Reason brings them back to Temper  And gentle Softness  SIGISMUNDA  True O true RODOLPHO  Blest be thy kindred Worth for loving his  He is all Warmth all amiable Fire  All quick Heroic Ardor temper'd soft  With Gentleness of Heart and manly Reason  If Virtue were to wear a human Form  To light it with her Dignity and Flame  Then softening mix her Smiles and tender Graces  O she would chuse the Person of my TANCRED  Go on my Friend go on and ever praise him  The Subject knows no Bounds nor can I tire  While my Breast trembles to that sweetest Musick  The Heart of Woman tastes no truer Joy  Is never flatter'd with such dear Enchantment  'Tis more than selfish Vanityas when  She hears the Praises of the Man she loves  LAURA  Madam your Father comes  SCENE II  SIFFREDI    SIGISMUNDA    LAURA  SIFFREDI  To an Attendant as he enters  Lord

Daughter leave me  SIGISMUNDA  I go my FatherBut how fAres the King  SIFFREDI  He is no more Gone to that awful State  Where Kings the Crown wear only of their Virtues  SIGISMUNDA  How bright must then be hisThis Stroke is sudden  He was this Morning well when to the Chace  Lord TANCRED went  SIFFREDI  'Tis true But at his Years  Death gives short NoticeDropping Nature then  Without a Gust of Pain to shake it falls  His Death my Daughter was that happy Period  Which few attain The Duties of his Day  Were all discharg'd and gratefully enjoy'd  It's noblest Blessings calm as Evening Skies  Was his pure Mind and lighted up with Hopes  That open Heaven when for his last long Sleep  Timely prepar'd a Lassitude of Life  A pleasing Weariness of mortal Joy  Fell on his Soul and down he sunk to Rest  O may my Death be suchHe but one Wish  Left unfulfill'd which was to see Count TANCRED  SIGISMUNDA  To see Count TANCREDPardon me my Lord  SIFFREDI  For what my DaughterBut with such Emotion  Why did you start at Mention of Count TANCRED  SIGISMUNDA  NothingI only hop'd the dying King  Might mean to make some generous just Provision  For this your worthy Charge this noble Orphan  SIFFREDI  And he has done it largelyLeave me now  I want some private Conference with Lord TANCRED  SCENE III  SIFFREDI alone  My Doubts are but too trueIf these old Eyes  Can trace the Marks of Love a mutual Passion  Has seiz'd I fear my Daughter and this Prince  My Sovereign nowShould it be so Ah there  There lurks a brooding Tempest that may shake  My longconcerted Scheme to settle firm  The publick Peace and Welfare which the King  Has made the prudent Basis of his Will  Away unworthy Views you shall not tempt me  Nor Interest nor Ambition shall seduce  My fixt Resolveperish the selfish Thought  Which our own Good prefers to that of Millions  He comesmy Kingunconscious of his Fortune  SCENE IV  TANCRED SIFFREDI  TANCRED  My Lord SIFFREDI in your Looks I read  Confirm'd the mournful News that fly abroad  From Tongue to TongueWe then at last have lost  The good old King  SIFFREDI  Yes We have lost a Father  The greatest Blessing Heaven bestows on Mortals  And sEldom found amidst these Wilds of Time  A good a woRthy KingHear me my TANCRED  And I will tell thee in a few plain Words  How he deserv'd that best that glorious Title  'Tis nought complex 'tis clear as Truth and Virtue  He lov'd his People deem'd them all his Children  The Good exalted and depress'd the Bad  He spurn'd the flattering Crew with Scorn rejected  Their smooth Advice that only means themselves  Their Schemes to aggrandize him into Baseness  Nor did he less disdain the secret Breath  The whisper'd Tale that blights a virtuous Name  He sought alone the Good of Those for whom  He was entrusted with the sovereign Power  Well knowing that a People in their Rights  And Industry protected living safe  Beneath the sacred Shelter of the Laws  Encourag'd in their Genius Arts and Labours  And happy each as he himself deserves  Are ne'er ungrateful With unsparing Hand  They will for Him provide their filial Love  And Confidence are his unfailing Treasure  And every honest Man his faithful Guard  TANCRED  A general Face of Grief o'erspreads the City  I mark'd the People as I hither came  In Crouds assembled struck with silent Sorrow  And pouring forth the noblest Praise of Tears  Those whom Remembrance of their former Woes  And long Experience of the vain Illusions  Of youthful Hope had into wise Content  And Fear of Change corrected wrung their Hands  And often casting up their Eyes to Heaven  Gave sign of sad Conjecture Others shew'd  Athwart their Grief or real or affected  A Gleam of Expectation from what Chance  And Change might bring A mingled Murmur run  Along the Streets and from the lonely Court  Of him who can no more assist their Fortunes  I saw the CourtierFry with eager haste  All hurrying to CONSTANTIA  SIFFREDI  Noble Youth  I joy to hear from Thee these just Reflexions  Worthy of riper YearsBut if they seek  CONSTANTIA trust me they mistake their Course  TANCRED  How Is she not my Lord the late King's Sister  Heir to the Crown of  Sicily  the last  Of our fam'd  Norman  Line and now our Queen  SIFFREDI  TANCRED 'tis true she is the late King's Sister  The sole surviving Offspring of that Tyrant  WILLIAM  the Bad  so for his Vices stil'd  Who spilt much noble Blood and sore oppress'd  Th' exhausted Land whence grievous Wars arose  And many a dire Convulsion shook the State  When He whose Death  Sicilia  mourns today  WILLIAM who has and well deserv'd the Name  Of  Good  succeeding to his Father's Throne  Reliev'd his Country's WoesBut to return  She is the late King's Sister born some Months  After the Tyrant's Death but not next Heir  TANCRED  You much surprize meMay I then presume  To ask who is  SIFFREDI  Come nearer noble TANCRED  Son of my Care I must on this occasion  Consult thy generous Heart which when conducted  By Rectitude of Mind and honest Virtues  Gives better Counsel than the hoary Head  Then know there lives a Prince here in  Palermo    The lineal Offspring of our famous Heroe  ROGER the First  TANCRED  Great HeavenHow far remov'd  From that our mighty Founder  SIFFREDI  His great Grandson  Sprung from his eldest Son who died untimely  Before his Father  TANCRED  Ha the Prince you mean  Is he not MANFRED'S Son The generous brave  Unhappy MANFRED whom the Tyrant WILLIAM  You just now mention'd not content to spoil  Of his paternal Crown threw into Fetters  And infamously murder'd  SIFFREDI  Yesthe same  TANCRED  By Heavens I joy to find our  Norman  Reign  The Light of Earth amidst these barbarous Ages  Yet rears it's head and shall not from the Lance  Pass to the feeble DistaffBut this Prince  Where has he lain conceal'd  SIFFREDI  The late good King  By noble Pity mov'd contriv'd to save him  From his dire Father's unrelenting Rage  And had him rear'd in private as became  His Birth and Hopes with high and princely Nurture  Till now too young to rule a troubled State  By Civil Broils most miserably torn  He in his safe Retreat has lain conceal'd  His Birth and Fortune to himself unknown  But when the dying King to me entrusted  As to the Chancellor of the Realm his Will  His Successor he nam'd him  TANCRED  Happy Youth  He then will triumph o'er his Father's Foes  O'er haughty OSMOND and the Tyrant's Daughter  SIFFREDI  Ay That is what I dreadthat Heat of Youth  There lurks I fear Perdition to the State  I dread the Horrors of rekindled War  Tho' dead the Tyrant still is to be fear'd  His Daughter's Party still is strong and numerous  Her Friend Earl OSMOND Constable of  Sicily    Experienc'd brave highborn of mighty Interest  Better the Prince and Princess should by Marriage  Unite their Friends their Interest and their Claims  Then will the Peace and Welfare of the Land  On a firm Basis rise  TANCRED  My Lord SIFFREDI  If by myself I of this Prince may judge  That Scheme will scarce succeedYour prudent Age  In vain will counsel if the Heart forbid it  But wherefore fear The Right is clearly his  And under your Direction with each Man  Of Worth and stedfast Loyalty to back  At once the King's Appointment and his Birthright  There is no ground for Fear They have great Odds  Against the astonish'd Sons of Violence  Who fight with awful Justice on their Side  All  Sicily  will rouze all faithful Hearts  Will range themselves around Prince MANFRED'S Son  For me I here devote me to the Service  Of this young Prince I every Drop of Blood  Will lose with Joy with Transport in his Cause  Pardon my Warmthbut That my Lord will never  To this Decision comeThen find the Prince  Lose not a Moment to awaken in him  The Royal Soul Perhaps he now desponding  Pines in a Corner and laments his Fortune  That in the narrow Bounds of private Life  He must confine his Aims those swelling Virtues  Which from his noble Father he inherits  SIFFREDI  Perhaps regardless in the common Bane  Of Youth he melts in Vanity and Love  But if the Seeds of Virtue glow within him  I will awake a higher Sense a Love  That grasps the Loves and Happiness of Millions  TANCRED  Why that Surmise Or should he love SIFFREDI  I doubt not it is nobly which will raise  And animate his VirtuesO permit me  To plead the Cause of YouthTheir Virtue oft  In Pleasure's  Enchantment lull'd a while  Forgets itself it sleeps and gayly dreams  Till great Occasion rouse it Then all Flame  It walks abroad with heighten'd Soul and Vigour  And by the Change astonishes the World  Even with a kind of Sympathy I feel  The Joy that waits this Prince when all the Powers  Th' expanding Heart can wish of doing good  Whatever swells Ambition or exalts  The human Soul into divine Emotions  All croud at once upon him  SIFFREDI  Ah my TANCRED  Nothing so easy as in Speculation  And at a distance seen the Course of Honour  A fair delightful Champian strew'd with Flowers  But when the Practice comes when our fond Passions  Pleasure and Pride and SelfIndulgence throw  Their magic Dust around the Prospect roughens  Then dreadful Passes craggy Mountains rise  Cliffs to be scal'd and Torrents to be stem'd  Then Toil ensues and Perseverance stern  And endless Combats with our grosser Sense  Oft lost and oft renew'd and generous Pain  For others felt and harder Lesson still  Our honest Bliss for others sacrific'd  And all the rugged Task of Virtue quails  The stoutest Heart of common Resolution  Few get above this turbid Scene of Strife  Few gain the Summit breathe that purest Air  That heavenly Ether which untroubled sees  The Storm of Vice and Passion rage below  TANCRED  Most true my Lord But why thus augure Ill  You seem to doubt this Prince I know him not  Yet oh methinks my Heart could answer for him  The Juncture is so high so strong the Gale  That blows from Heaven as thro' the deadest Soul  Might breathe the godlike Energy of Virtue  SIFFREDI  Hear him immortal Shades of his great Fathers  Forgive me Sir this Trial of your Heart  Thou Thou art he  TANCRED  SIFFREDI  SIFFREDI  TANCRED thou  Thou art the Man of all the many Thousands  That toil upon the Bosom of this Isle  By Heaven elected to command the rest  To rule protect them and to make them happy  TANCRED  MANFRED my Father I the last Support  Of the fam'd  Norman  Line that awes the World  I who this Morning wander'd forth an Orphan  Outcast of all but Thee my second Father  Thus call'd to Glory to the first great Lot  Of Human KindO wonderworking HAND  That in majestic Silence sways at will  The mighty Movements of unbounded Nature  O grant me HEAVEN the Virtues to sustain  This awful Burden of so many Heroes  Let me not be exalted into Shame  Set up the worthless Pageant of vain Grandeur  Meantime I thank the Justice of the King  Who has my Right bequeath'd me Thee SIFFREDI  I thank TheeO I ne'er enough can thank Thee  Yes thou hast beenthou artshalt be my Father  Thou shalt direct my unexperienc'd Years  Shalt be the ruling Head and I the Hand  SIFFREDI  It is enough for meto see my Sovereign  Assert his Virtues and maintain his Honour  TANCRED  I think my Lord you said the King committed  To you his Will I hope it is not clogg'd  With any base Conditions any Clause  To tyrannize my Heart and to CONSTANTIA  Enslave my Hand devoted to another  The Hint you just now gave of that Alliance  You must imagine wakes my Fear But know  In this alone I will not bear Dispute  Not even from Thee SIFFREDILet the Council  Be strait assembled and the Will there open'd  Thence issue speedy Orders to convene  This Day ere Noon the Senate where those Barons  Who now are in  Palermo  will attend  To pay their ready Homage to their King  Their rightful King who claims his native Crown  And will not be a King of Deeds and Parchments  SIFFREDI  I go my Liege But once again permit me  To tell youNow now is the trying Crisis  That must determine of your future Reign  O with Heroic Rigour watch your Heart  And to the sovereign Duties of the King  Th' unequal'd Pleasures of a God on Earth  Submit the common Joys the common Passions  Nay even the Virtues of the private Man  TANCRED  Of That no more They not oppose but aid  Invigorate cherish and reward each other  The kind allruling WISDOM is no Tyrant  SCENE V  TANCRED alone  Now generous SIGISMUNDA comes my Turn  To shew my Love was not of thine unworthy  When Fortune bade me blush to look to Thee  But what is Fortune to the Wish of Love  A miserable Bankrupt O'tis poor  'Tis scanty all whate'er we can bestow  The Wealth of Kings is Wretchedness and Want  Quick let me find Her taste that highest Joy  Th' exalted Heart can know the mixt Effusion  Of Gratitude and LoveBehold She comes  SCENE VI  TANCRED SIGISMUNDA  TANCRED  My fluttering Soul was all on Wing to find Thee  My Love my SIGISMUNDA  SIGISMUNDA  O my TANCRED  Tell me what means this Mystery and Gloom  That lowrs around Just now involv'd in Thought  My Father shot athwart meYou my Lord  Seem strangely mov'dI fear some dark Event  From the King's Death to trouble our Repose  That tender Calm we in the Woods of  Belmont  So happily enjoy'dExplain this Hurry  What means it Say  TANCRED  It means that we are happy  Beyond our most romantic Wishes happy  SIGISMUNDA  You but perplex me more  TANCRED  It means my Fairest  That thou art Queen of  Sicily  and I  The happiest of Mankind than Monarch more  Because with Thee I can adorn my Throne  MANFRED who fell by Tyrant WILLIAM'S Rage  Fam'd ROGER'S lineal Issue was my Father  pausing  You droop my Love dejected on a sudden  You seem to mourn my FortuneThe soft Tear  Springs in thy EyeO let me kiss it off  Why this my SIGISMUNDA  SIGISMUNDA  Royal TANCRED  None at your glorious Fortune can like me  Rejoiceyet me alone of all  Sicilians    It makes unhappy  TANCRED  I should hate it then  Should throw with Scorn the splendid Ruin from me  No SIGISMUNDA 'tis my Hope with Thee  To share it whence it draws it's richest Value  SIGISMUNDA  You are my SovereignI at humble Distance  TANCRED  Thou art my Queen the Sovereign of my Soul  You never reign'd with such  hant Luster  Such winning Charms as now yet thou art still  The dear the tender generous SIGISMUNDA  Who with a Heart exalted far above  Those selfish Views that charm the common Breast  Stoop'd from the Height of Life and courted Beauty  Then then to love me when I seem'd of Fortune  The hopeless Outcast when I had no Friend  None to protect and own me but thy Father  And would'st thou claim all Goodness to thyself  Canst thou thy TANCRED deem so dully form'd  Of such gross Clay just as I reach the Point  A Point my wildest Hopes could never image  In that great Moment full of every Virtue  That I should then so mean a Traytor prove  To the best Bliss and Honour of Mankind  So much disgrace the human Heart as then  For the dead Form of Flattery and Pomp  The faithless Joys of Courts to quit kind Truth  The cordial Sweets of Friendship and of Love  The Life of Life my All my SIGISMUNDA  I could upbraid thy Fears call them unkind  Cruel unjust an Outrage to my Heart  Did they not spring from Love  SIGISMUNDA  Think not my Lord  That to such vulgar Doubts I can descend  Your Heart I know disdains the little Thought  Of changing with the vain external Change  Of Circumstance and Fortune Rather thence  It would with rising Ardor greatly feel  A noble Pride to shew itself the same  But ah the Hearts of Kings are not their own  There is a haughty Duty that subjects them  To Chains of State to wed the publick Welfare  And not indulge the tender private Virtues  Some highdescended Princess who will bring  New Power and Interest to your Throne demands  Your royal Handperhaps CONSTANTIA  TANCRED  She  O name her not Were I this Moment free  And disengag'd as he who never felt  The powerful Eye of Beauty never sigh'd  For matchless Worth like thine I should abhor  All Thoughts of that Alliance Her fell Father  Most basely murder'd mine and she the Daughter  Supported by his barbarous Party still  His Pride inherits his imperious Spirit  And insolent Pretensions to my Throne  And canst thou deem me then so poorly tame  So cool a Traitor to my Father's Blood  As from the prudent Cowardice of State  E'er to submit to such a base Proposal  Detested Thought O doubly doubly hateful  From the two strongest Passions from Aversion  To this CONSTANTIAand from Love to Thee  Custom 'tis true a venerable Tyrant  O'er servile Man extends her blind Dominion  The Pride of Kings enslaves them their Ambition  Or Interest lords it o'er the better Passions  But vain their Talk mask'd under specious Words  Of Station Duty and of Public Good  They whom just Heaven has to a Throne exalted  To guard the Rights and Liberties of others  What Duty binds them to betray their own  For me my freeborn Heart shall bear no Dictates  But those of Truth and Honour wear no Chains  But the dear Chains of Love and SIGISMUNDA  Or if indeed my Choice must be directed  By Views of Publick Good whom shall I chuse  So fit to grace to dignify a Crown  And beam sweet Mercy on a happy People  As Thee my Love whom place upon my Throne  But Thee descended from the good SIFFREDI  'Tis fit that Heart be thine which drew from him  Whate'er can make it worthy thy Acceptance  SIGISMUNDA  Cease cease to raise my Hopes above my Duty  Charm me no more my TANCREDO that We  In those blest Woods where first you won my Soul  Had pass'd our gentle Days far from the Toil  And Pomp of Courts Such is the Wish of Love  Of Love that with delightful Weakness knows  No Bliss and no Ambition but itself  But in the World's full Light those charming Dreams  Those fond Illusions vanish Awful Duties  The Tyranny of Men even your own Heart  Where lurks a Sense your Passion stifles now  And proud imperious Honour call you from me  'Tis all in vainYou cannot hush a Voice  That murmrrs hereI must not be persuaded  TANCRED kneeling  Hear me thou Soul of all my Hopes and Wishes  And witness Heaven Prime Source of Love and Joy  Not a whole warring World combin'd against me  It's Pride it's Splendor it's imposing Forms  Nor Interest nor Ambition nor the Face  Of solemn State not even thy Father's Wisdom  Shall ever shake my Faith to SIGISMUNDA  Trumpets and Acclamations heard  But hark the Publick Voice to Duties calls me  Which with unweary'd Zeal I will discharge  And Thou yes Thou shalt be my bright Reward  Yetere I goto hush thy lovely Fears  Thy delicate Objections  writes his Name  Take this Blank  Sign'd with my Name and give it to thy Father  Tell him 'tis my Command it be fill'd up  With a most strict and solemn MarriageContract  How dear each Tie how charming to my Soul  That more unites me to my SIGISMUNDA  For thee and for my People's Good to live  Is all the Bliss which sovereign Power can give  ACT II  SCENE I  SIFFREDI alone  SO far 'tis wellThe late King's Will proceeds  Upon the Plan I counsel'd that Prince TANCRED  Shall make CONSTANTIA Partner of his Throne  O great O wish'd Event whence the dire Seeds  Of dark intestine Broils of Civil War  And all it's dreadful Miseries and Crimes  Shall be for ever rooted from the Land  May these dim Eyes long blasted by the Rage  Of cruel Faction and my Country's Woes  Tir'd with the Toils and Vanities of Life  Behold this Period then be clos'd in Peace  But how this mighty Obstacle surmount  Which Love has thrown betwixt Love that disturbs  The Schemes of Wisdom still that wing'd with Passion  Blind and impetuous in it's fond Pursuits  Leaves the greyheaded Reason far behind  Alas how frail the State of human Bliss  When even our honest Passions oft destroy it  I was to blame in Solitude and Shades  Infectious Scenes  trust their youthful Hearts  Would I had mark'd the rising Flame that now  Burns out with dangerous ForceMy Daughter owns  Her Passion for the King she trembling own'd it  With Prayers and Tears and tender Supplications  That almost shook my FirmnessAnd this Blank  Which his rash Fondness gave her shews how much  To what a wild Extravagance he loves  I see no Meansit  oils my deepest Thought  How to controul this Madness of the King  That wears the Face of Virtue and will thence  Disdain Restraint will from his generous Heart  Borrow new Rage even speciously oppose  To Reason ReasonBut it must be done  My own Advice of which I more and more  Approve the strict Conditions of the Will  Highly demand his Marriage with CONSTANTIA  Or else her Party has a fair Pretence  And all at once is Horror and Confusion  How issue from this MazeThe crouding Barons  Here summon'd to the Palace meet already  To pay their Homage and confirm the Will  On a few Moments hangs the Publick Fate  On a few hasty MomentsHa there shone  A Gleam of HopeYeswith this very Paper  I yet will save himNecessary Means  For good and noble Ends can ne'er be wrong  In that resistless that peculiar Case  Deceit is Truth and VirtueBut how hold  This Lion in the ToilO  will form it  Of such a fatal Thread twist it so strong  With all the Ties of Honour and of Duty  That his most desperate Fury shall not break  The honest SnareHere is the Royal Hand  I will beneath it write a perfect  ull  And absolute Agreement to the Will  Which read before the Nobles of the Realm  Assembled in the sacred Face of  Sicily    CONSTANTIA present every Heart and Eye  Fix'd on their Monarch every Tongue applauding  He must submit his Dream of Love must vanish  It shall be doneTo me I know 'tis Ruin  But Safety to the Publick to the King  I will not reason more I will not listen  Even to the Voice of HonourNo'tis fix'd  I here devote me for my Prince and Country  Let them be safe and let me nobly perish  Behold Earl OSMOND comes without whose Aid  My Schemes are all in vain  SCENE II  OSMOND SIFFREDI  OSMOND  My Lord SIFFREDI  I from the Council hasten'd to CONSTANTIA  And have accomplish'd what we there propos'd  The Princess to the Will submits her Claims  She with her Presence means to grace the Senate  And of your royal Charge young TANCRED'S Hand  Accept At first

Delusions I renounce  It's hot Determinations that confine  All Merit and all Virtue to itself  To yours I join my Hand with you will own  No Interest and no Party but my Country  Nor is your

Daughter to my Wishes  But does she give herself Gay young and flatter'd  Perhaps engag'd will she her youthful Heart  Yield to my harsher uncomplying Years  I am not form'd by Flattery and Praise  By Sighs and Tears and all the whining Trade  Of Love to feed a Fairone's Vanity  To charm at once and spoil her These soft Arts  Nor suit my Years nor Temper these be left  To Boys and doating Age A prudent Father  By Nature charg'd to guide and rule her Choice  Resigns his Daughter to a Husband's Power  Who with superior Dignity with Reason  And manly Tenderness will ever love her  Not first a kneeling Slave and then a Tyrant  SCENE IV  OSMOND BARONS  OSMOND  My Lords I greet you well This wondrous Day  Unites us all in Amity and Friendship  We meet today with open Hearts and Looks  Not

generous Heart  That thro' the Cobweb System bursting lays  Their Labours wasteSo will this Business prove  Or I mistake the KingBack from the Pomp  He seem'd at first to shrink and round his Brow  I mark'd a gathering Cloud when by his Side  As if design'd to share the public Homage  He saw the Tyrant's Daughter But confess'd  At least to me the doubling Tempest frown'd  And shook his swelling Bosom when he heard  Th' unjust the base Conditions of the Will  Uncertain tost in cruel Agitation  He oft methought address'd himself to speak  And interrupt SIFFREDI who appear'd  With conscious

timorous Weakness  Even dastardly in Falshood made him blush  To act this Scene in SIGISMUNDA'S Eye  Who sunk beneath his Perfidy and Baseness  Hence till tomorrow he adjourn'd the Senate  Tomorrow fix'd with Infamy to crown him  Then leading off his gay triumphant Princess  He left the poor unhappy SIGISMUNDA  To bend her trembling Steps to that sad Home  His faithless Vows will render hateful

crawls upon this Earth  Robb'd of each Comfort Heaven bestows on Mortals  On the bare Ground has still his Virtue left  The sacred Treasures of an honest Heart  Which thou hast dar'd with rash audacious Hand  And impious Fraud in me to violate  SIFFREDI  Behold my Liege that rash audacious Hand  Which not repents its CrimeO glorious happy  If by my Ruin I can save your Honour  TANCRED  Such Honour I renounce with sovereign Scorn  Greatly detest it and its mean Adviser  Hast thou not dar'd beneath my Name to shelter  My Name for other Purposes design'd  Given from the Fondness of a faithful Heart  With the best Love o'erflowinghast thou not  Beneath thy Sovereign's Name basely presum'd  To shield a Lye a Lye in Public utter'd  To all deluded  Sicily  But know  This poor Contrivance is as weak as base  In such a wretched Toil none can be held  But Fools and CowardsO thy slimsy Arts  Touch'd by my just my burning Indignation  Shall burst like Threads in FlameThy doating Prudence  But more secures the Purpose it would shake  Had my Resolves been wavering and doubtful  This would confirm them make them fix'd as Fate  This adds the only Motive that was wanting  To urge them on thro' War and Desolation  What marry Her CONSTANTIA Her the Daughter  Of the fell Tyrant who destroy'd my Father  The very Thought is Madness Ere thou seest  The Torch of HYMEN light these hated Nuptials  Thou shalt behold  Sicilia  wrapt in Flames  Her Cities raz'd her Valleys drench'd with Slaughter  Love set asidemy Pride assumes the Quarrel  My Honour now is up in spite of Thee  A World combin'd against me I will give  This scatter'd Will in fragments to the Winds  Assert my Rights the Freedom of my Heart  Crush all who dare oppose me to the Dust  And heap Perdition on Thee  SIFFREDI  Sir 'tis just  Exhaust on me your Rage I claim it all  But for these public Threats thy Passion utters  'Tis what Thou canst not do  TANCRED  I cannot Ha  Driven to the dreadful Brink of suck Dishonour  Enough to make the tamest Coward brave  And into Fierceness rouze the mildest Nature  What shall arrest my Vengeance who  SIFFREDI  Thy Self  TANCRED  Away dare not to justify thy Crime  That That alone can aggravate it's Horror  Add Insolence to Insolenceperhaps  May make my Rage forget  SIFFREDI  O let it burst  On this grey Head devoted to thy Service  But when the Storm has vented all it's Fury  Thou then must hearnay more I know thou wilt  Wilt hear the calm yet stronger Voice of Reason  Thou must reflect that a whole People's Safety  The Weal of trusted Millions should bear down  Thy self the Judge thy fondest partial Pleasure  Thou must reflect that there are other Duties  A nobler Pride a more exalted Honour  Superior Pleasures far that will oblige  Compel thee to abide by this my Deed  Unwarranted perhaps in common Justice  But which Necessity even Virtue's Tyrant  With awful Voice commandedYes thou must  In calmer hours divest thee of thy Love  These common Passions of the vulgar Breast  This boiling Heat of Youth and be a King  The Lover of thy People  TANCRED  Truths illemploy'd  Abus'd to colour Guilta King a King  Yes I will be a King but not a Slave  In This will be a King in this my People  Shall learn to judge how I will guard their Rights  When they behold me vindicate my own  But have I say been treated like a King  Heavens could I stoop to such outragious Usage  I were a mean a shameless Wretch unworthy  To wield a Scepter in a Land of Slaves  A Soil abhor'd of Virtue should bely  My Father's Blood bely those very Maxims  At other times you taught my YouthSIFFREDI  in a softened Tone of Voice  SIFFREDI  Behold my Prince behold thy poor old Servant  Whose darling Care these twenty Years has been  To nurse thee up to Virtue who for Thee  Thy Glory and thy Weal renounces all  All Interest or Ambition can pour forth  What many a selfish Father would pursue  Thro' Treachery and Crimes behold him here  Bent on his feeble Knees to beg conjure Thee  With Tears to beg Thee to controul thy Passion  And save thy self thy Honour and thy People  Kneeling with me behold the many Thousands  To thy Protection trusted Fathers Mothers  The sacred Front of venerable Age  The tender Virgin and the helpless Infant  The Ministers of Heaven Those who maintain  Around thy Throne the Majesty of Rule  And Those whose Labour scorch'd by Winds and Sun  Feeds the rejoicing Public see them all  Here at thy Feet conjuring Thee to save them  From Misery and War from Crimes and Rapine  Can there be aught kind Heaven in Selfindulgence  To weigh down These This Aggregate of Love  With which compar'd the dearest private Passion  Is but the wafted Dust upon the Ballance  Turn not awayOh is there not some Part  In thy great Heart so sensible to Kindness  And generous Warmth some nobler Part to feel  The Prayers and Tears of These the mingled Voice  Of Heaven and Earth  TANCRED  There is and thou hast touch'd it  Rise rise SIFFREDIOh Thou hast undone me  Unkind old ManO illentreated TANCRED  Which Way soe'er I turn Dishonour rears  Her hideous Frontand Misery and Ruin  Was it for This you took such Care to form me  For This imbued me with the quickest Sense  Of Shame these finer Feelings that ne'er vex  The common Mass of Mortals dully happy  In blest Insensibility O rather  You should have  ear'd my Heart taught me that Power  And splendid Interest lord it still o'er Virtue  That gilded by Prosperity and Pride  There is no Shame no Meanness temper'd thus  I had been fit to rule a venal World  Alas what meant thy Wantonness of Prudence  Why have you rais'd this miserable Conflict  Betwixt the Duties of the King and Man  Set Virtue against VirtueAh SIFFREDI  'Tis thy superfluous thy unfeeling Wisdom  That has involv'd me in a Maze of Error  Almost beyond RetreatBut hold my Soul  Thy steady PurposeTost by various Passions  To this eternal Anchor keepThere is  Can be no Public without Private Virtue  Then mark me well observe what I command  It is the sole Expedient now remaining  Tomorrow when the Senate meets again  Unfold the whole unravel the Deceit  Nor That alone try to repair it's Mischief  There all thy Power thy Eloquence and Interest  Exert to reinstate me in my Rights  And from thy own dark Snares to disembroil me  Start not my LordThis must and shall be done  Or here our Friendship endsHowe'er disguis'd  Whatever thy Pretence thou art a Traitor  SIFFREDI  I should indeed deserve the Name of Traitor  And even a Traitor's Fate had I so slightly  From Principles so weak done what I did  As e'er to disavow it  TANCRED  Ha  SIFFREDI  My Liege  Expect not ThisTho' practis'd long in Courts  I have not so far learn'd their subtle Trade  To veer obedient with each Gust of Passion  I honour Thee I venerate thy Orders  But honour more my Duty Nought on Earth  Shall ever shake me from that solid Rock  Nor Smiles nor Frowns  TANCRED  You will not then  SIFFREDI  I cannot  TANCRED  Away BegoneO my RODOLPHO come  And save me from this TraitorHence I say  Avoid my Presence strait and know old Man  Thou my worst Foe beneath the Mask of Friendship  Who not content to trample in the Dust  My dearest Rights dost with cool Insolence  Persist and call it Duty hadst thou not  A Daughter that protects thee thou shouldst feel  The Vengeance thou deservestNo Reply  Away  SCENE IX  TANCRED RODOLPHO  RODOLPHO  What can incense my Prince so highly  Against his Friend SIFFREDI  TANCRED  Friend RODOLPHO  When I have told thee what this Friend has done  How play'd me like a Boy a base born Wretch  Who had nor Heart nor Spirit thou wilt stand  Amaz'd and wonder at my stupid Patience  RODOLPHO  I heard with mixt Astonishment and Grief  The King's unjust dishonourable Will  Void in itselfI saw you stung with Rage  And writhing in the Snare just as I went  At your Command to wait you hereBut That  Was the King's Deed not his  TANCRED  O He advis'd it  These many Years he has in secret hatch'd  This black Contrivance glories in the Scheme  And proudly plumes him with his traiterous Virtue  But that was nought RODOLPHO nothing nothing  O that was gentle blameless to what follow'd  I had my Friend to SIGISMUNDA given  To hush her Fears in the full Gush of Fondness  A Blank sign'd by my Handand heO Heavens  Was ever such a wild Attempthe wrote  Beneath my Name an absolute Compliance  To this detested Will nay dar'd to read it  Before my self on my insulted Throne  His idle Pageant plac'dOh Words are weak  To paint the Pangs the Rage the Indignation  That whirl'd from Thought to Thought my Soul in Tempest  Now on the Point to burst and now by Shame  Repress'dBut in the Face of  Sicily    All mad with Acclamation what RODOLPHO  What could I do The sole Relief that rose  To my distracted Mind was to adjourn  Th' Assembly till TomorrowBut Tomorrow  What can be doneO it avails not what  I care not what is doneMy only Care  Is how to clear my Faith to SIGISMUNDA  She thinks me false She cast a Look that kill'd me  O I am base in SIGISMUNDA'S Eye  The lowest of Mankind the most perfidious  RODOLPHO  This was a Strain of Insolence indeed  A daring Outrage of so strange a Nature  As stuns me quite  TANCRED  Curs'd be my timid Prudence  That dash'd not back that Moment in his Face  The bold presumptuous Lyeand curs'd this Hand  That from a Start of poor Dissimulation  Led off my SIGISMUNDA'S hated Rival  Ah then what poison'd by the false Appearance  What SIGISMUNDA were thy Thoughts of me  How in the silent Bitterness of Soul  How didst thou scorn me hate Mankind thy self  For trusting to the Vows of faithless TANCRED  For such I seem'dI wasThe Thought distracts me  I should have cast a flattering World aside  Rush'd from my Throne before them all avow'd Her  The Choice the Glory of my freeborn Heart  And spurn'd the shameful Fetters thrown upon it  Instead of thatConfusionwhat I did  Has clinch'd the Chain confirm'd SIFFREDI'S Crime  And fix'd me down to Infamy  RODOLPHO  My Lord  Blame not the Conduct which your Situation  Tore from your tortur'd HeartWhat could you do  Had you so circumstanc'd in open Senate  Before th' astonish'd Publick with no Friends  Prepar'd no Party form'd affronted thus  The haughty Princess and her powerful Faction  Supported by this Will the sudden Stroke  Abrupt and premature might have recoil'd  Upon your self even your own Friends revolted  And turn'd at once the publick Scale against you  Besides consider had you then detected  In its fresh Guilt this Action of SIFFREDI  You must with signal Vengeance have chastis'd  The treasonable DeedNothing so mean  As weak insulted Power that dares not punish  And how would that have suited with your Love  His Daughter present too Trust me your Conduct  Howe'er abhorrent to a Heart like yours  Was fortunate and wiseNot that I mean  E'er to advise Submission  TANCRED  Heavens Submission  Could I descend to bear it even in Thought  Despise me you the World and SIGISMUNDA  SubmissionNoTomorrow's glorious Light  Shall flash Discovery on this Scene of Baseness  Whatever be the Risque by Heavens Tomorrow  I will o'erturn the dirty Lyebuilt Schemes  Of these old Men and shew my faithful Senate  That MANFRED'S Son knows to assert and wear  With undiminish'd Dignity that Crown  This unexpected Day has plac'd upon him  But This my Friend these stormy Gusts of Pride  Are foreign to my LoveTill SIGISMUNDA  Be disabus'd my Breast is Tumult all  And can obey no settled Course of Reason  I see Her still I feel her powerful Image  That Look where with Reproach Complaint was mix'd  Big with soft Woe and gentle Indignation  Which seem'd at once to pity and to scorn me  O let me find Her I too long have left  My SIGISMUNDA to converse with Tears  A Prey to Thoughts that picture me a Villain  But ah how clogg'd with this accursed State  A tedious World shall I now find Access  Her Father tooTen Thousand Horrors croud  Into the wild fantastic Eye of Love  Who knows what he may do Come then my Friend  And by thy Sister's Hand O let me steal  A Letter to her BosomI no longer  Can bear her Absence by the just Contempt  She now must brand me with inflam'd to Madness  Fly my RODOLPHO fly engage thy Sister  To aid my Letter and this very Evening  Secure an InterviewI would not bear  This Rack another Day not for my Kingdom  Till then deepplung'd in Solitude and Shades  I will not see the hated Face of Man  Thought drives on Thought on Passions Passions roll  Her Smiles alone can calm my raging Soul  ACT III  SCENE I  SIGISMUNDA alone sitting in a disconsolate Posture  AH Tyrant Prince ah more than faithless TANCRED  Ungenerous and inhuman in thy Falsehood  Hadst Thou this Morning when my hopeless Heart  Submissive to my Fortune and my Duty  Had so much Spirit left as to be willing  To give Thee back thy Vows ah hadst Thou then  Confess'd the sad Necessity thy State  Impos'd upon Thee and with gentle Friendship  Since we must part at last our Parting soften'd  I should indeedI should have been unhappy  But not to this ExtreamAmidst my Grief  I had with pensive Pleasure cherish'd still  The sweet Remembrance of thy former Love  Thy Image still had dwelt upon my Soul  And made our guiltless Woes not undelightful  But coolly thusHow couldst thou be so cruel  Thus to revive my Hopes to soothe my Love  And call forth all its Tenderness then sink me  In black DespairWhat unrelenting Pride  Possess'd thy Breast that thou couldst bea  unmov'd  To see me bent beneath a Weight of Shame  Pangs thou canst never feel How couldst thou drag me  In barbarous Triumph at a Rival's Car  How make me Witness to a Sight of Horror  That Hand which but a few short Hours ago  So wantonly abus'd my simple Faith  Before th' attesting World given to another  Irrevocably givenThere was a Time  When the least Cloud that hung upon my Brow  Perhaps imagin'd only touch'd thy Pity  Then brighten'd often by the ready Tear  Thy Looks were Softness all then the quick Heart  In every Nerve alive forgot it self  And for each other then we felt alone  But now alas those tender Days are fled  Now thou canst see me wretched pierc'd with Anguish  With studied Anguish of thy own creating  Nor wet thy harden'd EyeHold let me think  I wrong Thee sure Thou canst not be so base  As meanly in my Misery  triumph  What is it thenWhy should I search for Pain  O 'tis as bad'Tis Fickleness of Nature  'Tis sickly Love extinguish'd by Ambition  Is there kind Heaven no Constancy in Man  No stedfast Truth no generous fix'd Affection  That can bear up against a selfish World  No there is noneEven TANCRED is inconstant  Rising  Hence let me fly this SceneWhate'er I see  These Roofs these Walls each Object that surrounds me  Are tainted with his VowsBut whither fly  The Groves are worse the soft Retreat of  Belmont    It's deepening Glooms gay Lawns and airy Summits  Will wound my busy Memory to Torture  And all its Shades will whisperfaithless TANCRED  My Father comesHow sunk in this Disorder  Shall I sustain his Presence  SCENE II  SIFFREDI    SIGISMUNDA  SIFFREDI  SIGISMUNDA  My dearest Child I grieve to find Thee thus  A Prey to Tears I know the powerful Cause  From which they flow and therefore can excuse them  But not their wilful obstinate Continuance  Come rouse Thee then call up thy drooping Spirit  Come wake to Reason from this Dream of Love  And shew the World thou art SIFFREDI'S Daughter  SIGISMUNDA  Alas I am unworthy of that Name  SIFFREDI  Thou art indeed to blame thou hast too rashly  Engag'd thy Heart without a Father's Sanction  But this I can forgive The King has Virtues  That plead thy full Excuse nor was I void  Of Blame to trust Thee to those dangerous Virtues  Then dread not my Reproaches Tho' he blames  Thy tender Father pities more than blames Thee  Thou art my Daughter still and if thy Heart  Will now resume its Pride assert itself  And greatly rise superior to this Trial  I to my warmest Confidence again  Will take thee and esteem thee more my Daughter  SIGISMUNDA  O you are gentler far than I deserve  It is it ever was my darling Pride  To bend my Soul to your supreme Commands  Your wisest Will and tho' by Love betray'd  Alas and punish'd tooI have transgress'd  The nicest Bounds of Duty yet I feel  A Sentiment of Tenderness a Source  Of filial Nature springing in my Breast  That should it kill me shall controul this Passion  And make me all Submission and Obedience  To you my honour'd Lord the best of Fathers  SIFFREDI  Come to my Arms Thou Comfort of my Age  Thou only Joy and Hope of these grey Hairs  Come let me take Thee to a Parent's Heart  There with the kindly Aid of my Advice  Even with the Dew of these paternal Tears  Revive and nourish this becoming Spirit  Then Thou dost promise me my SIGISMUNDA  Thy Father stoops to make it his Request  Thou wilt resign thy fond presumptuous Hopes  And henceforth never more indulge one Thought  That in the Light of Love regards the King  SIGISMUNDA  Hopes I have noneThose by this fatal Day  Are blasted allBut from my Soul  banish  While weeping Memory there retains her Seat  Thoughts which the purest Bosom might have cherish'd  Once my Delight now even in Anguish charming  Is more alas my Lord than I can promise  SIFFREDI  Absence and Time the Softner of our Passions  Will conquer This Mean time I hope from Thee  A generous great Effort that Thou wilt now  Exert thy utmost Force nor languish thus  Beneath the vain Extravagance of Love  Let not thy Father blush to hear it said  H  s Daughter was so weak e'er to admit  A Thought so void of Reason that a King  Should to his Rank his Honour and his Glory  The high important Duties of a Throne  Even to his Throne itself madly prefer  A wild  Passion the fond Child  Of youthful dreaming Thought and vacant Hours  That He should quit his Heavenappointed Station  Desert his awful Charge the Care of all  The toiling Millions which this Isle contains  Nay more shall plunge them into War and Ruin  And all to sooth a sick Imagination  A miserable WeaknessMust for thee  To make Thee blest  Sicilia  be unhappy  The King himself lost to the nobler Sense  Of manly Praise become the piteous Heroe  Of some soft Tale and rush on sure Destruction  Canst thou my Daughter let the monstrous Thought  Possess one Moment thy perverted Fancy  Rouse thee for Shame and if a Spark of Virtue  Lies slumbering in thy Soul bid it blaze forth  Nor sink unequal to the glorious Lesson  This Day thy Lover gave thee from his Throne  SIGISMUNDA  Ah that was not from VirtueHad my Father  That been his Aim I yield to what you say  'Tis powerful Truth unanswerable Reason  Then then with sad but duteous Resignation  I had submitted as became your Daughter  But in that Moment when my humbled Hopes  Were to my Duty reconcil'd to raise them  To yet a fonder Height than e'er they knew  Then rudely dash them downThere is the Stingâª  The blasting View is ever present to me  Why did you drag me to a Sight so cruel  SIFFREDI  It was a Scene to fire thy Emulation  SIGISMUNDA  It was a Scene of PerfidyBut know  I will do more than imitate the King  For he is falseI tho' sincerely pierc'd  With the best truest Passion ever touch'd  A Virgin's Breast here vow to Heaven and You  Tho' from my Heart I cannot from my Hopes  To cast this Princewhat would you more my Father  SIFFREDI  Yes one Thing morethy Father then is happy  Tho' by the Voice of Innocence and Virtue  Absolv'd we live not to our selves alone  A rigorous World with peremptory Sway  Subjects us all and even the Noblest most  This World from Thee my Honour and thy own  Demands one Step a Step by which convinc'd  The King may see thy Heart disdains to wear  A Chain which his has greatly thrown aside  'Tis fitting too thy Sex's Pride commands Thee  To shew th' approving World thou canst resign  As well as He nor with inferior Spirit  A Passion fatal to the Publick Weal  But above all thou must root our for ever  From the King's Breast the least Remain of Hope  And henceforth make  is mention'd Love Dishonour  These Things my Daughter that must needs be done  Can but this way be doneby the safe Refuge  The sacred Shelter of a Husband's Arms  And there is one  SIGISMUNDA  Good Heavens what means my Lord  SIFFREDI  One of illustrious Family high Rank  Yet still of higher Dignity and Merit  Who can and will protect Thee one to awe  The King himselfNay hear me SIGISMUNDA  The noble OSMOND courts Thee for his Bride  And has my plighted WordThis Day  SIGISMUNDA kneeling  My Father  Let me with trembling Arms embrace thy Knees  O if you ever wish'd to see me happy  If e'er in infant Years I gave you Joy  When as I prattling twin'd around your Neck  You snatch'd me to your Bosom kiss'd my Eyes  And melting said you saw my Mother there  O save me from that worst Severity  Of Fate O outrage not my breaking Heart  To that degreeI cannot'tis impossible  So soon withdraw it give it to another  Hear me my dearest Father hear the Voice  Of Nature and Humanity that plead  As well as Justice for meNot to chuse  Without your wise

Beauty  She must be mineShe isIf yet her Heart  Consents not to my Happiness her Duty  Join'd to my tender Cares will gain so much  Upon her generous NatureThat will follow  The Man of Sense who acts

Pangs than real Guilt itself can feel Let me then conjure You to meet me in the Garden towards the Close of the  Day when I will explain this Mystery We have been most inhumanly abused and That by the

by the Favour of Count TANCRED  That I am here As much I scorn his Favour  As I defy his Tyranny and Threats  Our Friend GOFFREDO who commands the Castle  On my Parole ere Dawn to render back  My Person has permitted me this Freedom  Know then the faithless Outrage of Today  By him committed whom you call the King  Has rouz'd CONSTANTIA'S Court Our Friends the Friends  Of Virtue Justice and of Publick Faith  Ripe for Revolt are in high Ferment all  This this they say exceeds whate'er deform'd  The miserable Days we saw beneath  WILLIAM the  Bad  This saps the solid Base  At once of Government and private Life  This shameless Imposition on the Faith  The Majesty of Senates this lewd Insult  This Violation of the Rights of Men  Added to These his ignominious Treatment  Of Her th'illustrious Offspring of our Kings  Sicilia  's Hope and now our Royal Mistress  You know my Lord how grossly These infringe  The late King's Will which orders if Count TANCRED  Make not CONSTANTIA Partner of his Throne  That He be quite excluded the Succession  And She to HENRY given King of the  Romans    The potent Emperor BARBEROSSA'S Son  Who seeks with earnest Instance her Alliance  I

Concurrence  Who more than I have labour'd this great Point  'Tis my own Plan And if I drop it now  I should be justly branded with the shame  Of rash Advice or despicable Weakness  But let us not precipitate the Matter  CONSTANTIA'S Friends are numerous and strong  Yet TANCRED'S trust me are of equal Force  E'er since the Secret of his Birth was known  The People all are in a Tumult hurl'd  Of boundless Joy to hear there lives a Prince  Of mighty GUISCARD'S Line Numbers besides  Of powerful Barons who at heart had pin'd  To see the Reign of their renown'd Forefathers  Won by immortal Deeds of matchless Valour  Pass from the gallant  Normans  to the  Suevi    Will with a kind of rage espouse his Cause  'Tis so my Lordbe not by Passion blinded  'Tis surely soO if our prating Vertue  Dwells not in Words aloneO let us join  My generous OSMOND to avert these Woes  And yet sustain our tottering  Norman  Kingdom  OSMOND  But how SIFFREDI howIf by soft Means  We can maintain our Rights and save our Country  May his unnatural Blood first stain the Sword  Who with unpitying Fury first shall bare it  SIFFREDI  I have a ThoughtThe glorious Work be thine  But it requires an awful Flight of Virtue  Above the Passions of the vulgar Breast  And thence from thee I hope it noble OSMOND  Suppose my Daughter to her GOD devoted  Were plac'd within some Convent's sacred Verge  Beneath the dread Protection of the Altar  OSMOND  Ere Then by Heavens I would devoutly shave  My holy Scalp turn whining Monk myself  And pray incessant for the Tyrant's Safety  What How because an insolent Invader  A Sacrilegious Tyrant in Contempt  Of all those noblest Rights which to maintain  Is Man's peculiar Pride demands my Wife  That I shall thus betray the Common Cause  Of Human kind and tamely yield Her up  Even in the Manner you proposeO then  I were supremely vile degraded sham'd  The Scorn of Manhood and abhor'd of Honour  SIFFREDI  There is my Lord an Honour the calm Child  Of Reason of Humanity and Mercy  Superior far to this punctilious Demon  That singly minds it self and oft embroils  With proud barbarian Niceties the World  OSMOND  My Lord my LordI cannot brooke your Prudence  It holds a Pulse unequal to my Blood  Unblemish'd Honour is the Flower of Virtue  The vivifying Soul and He who slights it  Will leave the other dull and lifeless Dross  SIFFREDI  No moreYou are too warm  OSMOND  You are too cool  SIFFREDI  Too cool my Lord I were indeed too cool  Not to resent this Language and to tell Thee  I wish Earl OSMOND were as cool as I  To his own Selfish Blissay and as warm  To That of OthersBut of This no more  My Daughter is thy WifeI gave her to Thee  And will against all Force maintain her Thine  But think not I will catch thy headlong Passions  Whirl'd in a Blaze of Madness o'er the Land  Or till the last Extremity compel me  Risque the dire Means of WarThe King Tomorrow  Will set you free and if by gentle Means  He does not yield my Daughter to thy Arms  And wed CONSTANTIA as the Will requires  Why then expect me on the Side of Justice  Let that suffice  OSMOND  It doesForgive my Heat  My rankled Mind by Injuries inflam'd  May be too prompt to take and give Offence  SIFFREDI  'Tis pass'dYour Wrongs I own may well transport  The wisest MindBut henceforth noble OSMOND  Do me more Justice honour more my Truth  Nor mark me with an Eye of squint Suspicion  These Jars apartYou may repose your Soul  On my firm Faith and unremitting Friendship  Of That I sure have given exalted Proof  And the next Sun we see shall prove it further  Return my Son and from your Friend GOFFREDO  Release your Word There try by soft Repose  To calm your Breast  OSMOND  Bid the vext Ocean sleep  Swept by the Pinions of the raging North  But your frail Age by Care and Toil exhausted  Demands the Balm of allrepairing Rest  SIFFREDI  Soon as Tomorrow's Dawn shall streak the Skies  I with my Friends in solemn State assembled  Will to the Palace and demand your Freedom  Then by calm Reason or by higher Means  The King shall quit his Claim and in the Face  Of  Sicily  my Daughter shall be yours  Farewel  OSMOND  My Lord goodnight  SCENE III  OSMOND alone  After a long Pause  I like him not  YesI have mighty Matter of Suspicion  'Tis plainI see itLurking in his Breast  He has a foolish Fondness for this King  My Honour is not safe while here my Wife  RemainsWho knows but he this very Night  May bear Her to some Convent as he mention'd  The King tootho' I smother'd up my Rage  I mark'd it wellwill set me free Tomorrow  Why not Tonight He has some dark Design  By Heavens he hasI am abus'd most grosly  Made the vile Tool of this old Statesman's Schemes  Marry'd to OneAy and he knew itOne  Who loves young TANCRED Hence her swooning Tears  And all her soft Distress when she disgrac'd me  By basely giving her perfidious Hand  Without her HeartHell and Perdition This  This is the Perfidy This is the fell  The keen envenom'd exquisite Disgrace  Which to a Man of Honour even exceeds  The Falshood of the PersonBut I now  Will rouze me from the poor tame Lethargy  By my believing Fondness cast upon Me  I will not wait his crawling timid Motions  Perhaps to blind me meant which he Tomorrow  Has promis'd to pursue No ere his Eyes  Shall open on Tomorrow's orient Beam  I will convince him that Earl OSMOND never  Was form'd to be his DupeI know full well  Th' important Weight and Danger of the Deed  But to a Man whom greater Dangers press  Driven to the Brink of Infamy and Horror  Rashness itself and utter Desperation  Are the best PrudenceI will bear Her off  This Night and lodge Her in a Place of Safety  I have a trusty Band that waits not far  Hence Let me lose no TimeOne rapid Moment  Should ardent form at once and execute  A bold Design'Tis fix'd'Tis doneYes then  When I have seiz'd the Prize of Love and Honour  And with a Friend secur'd Her to the Castle  I will repair and claim GOFFREDO'S Promise  To rise with all his GarrisonMy Friends  With brave Impatience wait The Mine is laid  And only wants my kindling Touch to spring  SCENE IV  SIGISMUNDA'S  Apartment  SIGISMUNDA LAURA  LAURA  Heavens 'tis a fearful Night

Kind Rest perhaps may hush my Woes a little  Oh for that quiet Sleep that knows no Morning  LAURA  Madam indeed I know not how to go  Indulge my FondnessLet me watch a while  By your sad Bed till these dread Hours shall pass  SIGISMUNDA  Alas what is the Toil of Elements  This idle Perturbation of the Sky  To what I feel withinOh that the Fires  Of pitying Heaven would point there Fury here  Goodnight my dearest LAURA  LAURA  Oh I know not  What this Oppression meansbut 'tis with pain  With Tears I can persuade myself to leave you  Well thenGoodnight my dearest SIGISMUNDA  SCENE V  SIGISMUNDA  And am I then aloneThe most undone  Most wretched Being now beneath the Cope  Of this affrighting Gloom that wraps the World  I said I did not fearAh me I feel  A shivering Horror run thro' all my Powers  O I am nought but Tumult Fears and Weakness  And yet how idle Fear when Hope is gone  Gone gone foreverO Thou gentle Scene  Looking towards her Bed  Of sweet Repose where by th' oblivious Draught  Of each sad toilsome Day to Peace restor'd  Unhappy Mortals lose their Woes awhile  Thou hast no Peace for meWhat shall I do  How pass this dreadful Night so big with Terror  Here with the Midnight Shades here will I sit  sitting down  A Prey to dire Despair and ceaseless weep  The Hours awayBless meI heard a Noise  starting up  NoI mistookNothing but Silence reigns  And awful Midnight roundAgainO Heavens  My Lord the King  SCENE VI  TANCRED SIGISMUNDA  TANCRED  Be not allarm'd my Love  SIGISMUNDA  My Royal Lord why at this Midnight Hour  How came you hither  TANCRED  By that secret Way  My Love contriv'd when We in happier Days  Us'd to devote these Hours so much in vain  To Vows of Love and everlasting Friendship  SIGISMUNDA  Why will you thus persist to add new Stings  To her Distress who never can be thine  O  ly me fly You know  TANCRED  I know too much  O how I could reproach Thee SIGISMUNDA  Pour out my injur'd Soul in just Complaints  But now the Time permits not These swift Moments  I told thee how thy Father's Artisice  Forc'd me to seem perfidious in thy Eyes  Ah fatal Blindness not to have observ'd  The mingled Pangs of Rage and Love that shook me  When by my cruel Publick Situation  Compell'd I only feign'd Consent to gain  A little Time and more secure Thee mine  E'er sinceA dreadful Interval of Care  My Thoughts have been employ'd not without Hope  How to defeat SIFFREDI'S barbarous Purpose  But thy Credulity has ruin'd all  Thy rash thy wildI know not what to name it  Oh it has prov'd the giddy Hopes of Man  To be Delusion all and sickening Folly  SIGISMUNDA  Ah generous TANCRED ah thy Truth destroys me  Yes yes 'tis I 'tis I alone am false  My hasty Rage join'd to my tame Submission  More than the most exalted filial Duty  Could e'er demand has dash'd our Cup of Fate  With Bitterness unequal'dBut alas  What are thy Woes to mineto mine just Heaven  Now is thy Turn of Vengeancehate renounce me  O leave me to the Fate I well deserve  To sink in hopeless Miseryat least  Try to forget the worthless SIGISMUNDA  TANCRED  Forget Thee No Thou art my Soul itself  I have no Thought no Hope no Wish but Thee  Even this repented Injury the Fears  That rouze me all to Madness at the Thought  Of losing Thee the whole collected Pains  O my full Heart serve but to make thee dearer  Ah how forget TheeMuch must be forgot  Ere TANCRED can forget his SIGISMUNDA  SIGISMUNDA  But you my Lord must make that great Effort  TANCRED  Can SIGISMUNDA make it  SIGISMUNDA  Ah I know not  With what SuccessBut all that feeble Woman  And Loveentangled Reason can perform  I to the utmost will exert to do it  TANCRED  Fear not'Tis doneIf thou canst form the Thought  Success is sureI am forgot already  SIGISMUNDA  Ah TANCREDBut my Lord respect me more  Think who I amWhat can you now propose  TANCRED  To claim the plighted Vows which Heaven has heard  To vindicate the Rights of holy Love  By Faith and Honour bound to which compar'd  These empty Forms which have ensnar'd thy Hand  Are impious Guile Abuse and Profanation  Nay as a King whose high Prerogative  By this unlicens'd Marriage is affronted  To bid the Laws themselves pronounce it void  SIGISMUNDA  Honour my Lord is much too proud to catch  At every slender Twig of nice Distinctions  These for th' unfeeling Vulgar may do well  But Those whose Souls are by the nicer Rule  Of virtuous Delicacy nobly sway'd  Stand at another Bar than that of Laws  Then cease to urge meSince I am not born  To that exalted Fate to be your Queen  Or yet a dearer Nameto be your Wife  I am the Wife of an illustrious Lord  Of your own princely Blood and what I am  I will with proper Dignity remain  Retire my Royal LordThere is no Means  To cure the Wounds this fatal Day has given  We meet no more  TANCRED  Oh barbarous SIGISMUNDA  And canst Thou talk thus steadily thus treat me  With such unpitying unrelenting Rigour  Poor is the Love that rather than give up  A little Pride a little formal Pride  The Breath of Vanity can bear to see  The Man whose Heart was once so dear to thineâª  By many a tender Vow so mix'd togetherâª  A Prey to Anguish Fury and Distraction  Thou canst not surely make me such a Wretch  Thou canst not SIGISMUNDAYet relent  O save us yetRODOLPHO with my Guards  Waits in the GardenLet us seize the Moments  We ne'er may have againWith more than Power  I will assert Thee mine with fairest Honour  The World shall even approve each honest Bosom  Swell with a kindred Joy to see us happy  SIGISMUNDA  The World approveWhat is the World to m  The conscious Mind is its own awful World  And yet perhaps if thou wert not a King  I know not TANCRED what I might have done  Then then my Conduct sanctify'd by Love  Could not be deem'd by the severest Judge  The mean Effect of Interest or Ambition  But now not all my partial Heart can plead  Shall ever shake th' unalterable Dictates  That tyrannize my Breast  TANCRED  'Tis wellNo more  I yield me to my FateYes yes Inhuman  Since thy Barbarian Heart is steel'd by Pride  Shut up to Love and Pity here behold me  Cast on the Ground a vile and abject Wretch  Lost to all Cares all Dignities all Duties  Here will I grow breathe out my faithful Soul  Here at thy FeetDeath Death alone shall part us  SIGISMUNDA  Have you then vow'd to drive me to Perdition  What can I  oreYes TANCRED once again  I will forget the Dignity my Station  the last time  Will  Ties no Duty  Can ever  Bos om  O leave me fly me were it but in Pity  To see what once we tenderly have lov'd  Cut off from every Hopecut off for ever  Is Pain thy Generosity should spare me  Then rise my Lord and if you truly love me  If you respect my Honour nay my Peace  Retire For tho' th' Emotions of my Heart  Can ne'er alarm my Virtue yet alas  They tear it so they pierce it with such Anguish  Oh 'tis too muchI cannot bear the Conflict  SCENE VII  TANCRED OSMOND SIGISMUNDA  OSMOND entering  Turn Tyrant turn and answer to my Honour  For this thy base insufferable Outrage  TANCRED  Insolent Traitor think not to escape  Thyself my Vengeance  They fight  OSMOND  falls  SIGISMUNDA  Help here HelpO Heavens  Throwing herself down by him  Alas my Lord what meant your headlong Rage  That Faith which I this Day upon the Altar  To You devoted is unblemish'd pure  As Vestal Truth was resolutely yours  Beyond the Power of aught on Earth to shake it  OSMOND  Perfidious Woman dy  Shortening his Sword he plunges it into her Breast  and to the Grave  Attend a Husband yet but half aveng'd  TANCRED  O Horror Horror execrable Villain  OSMOND  And Tyrant ThouThou shalt not o'er my Tomb  Exult'Tis well'Tis greatI die content  dies  SCENE VIII  TANCRED SIFFREDI RODOLPHO SIGISMUNDA LAURA  TANCRED  throwing himself down by  SIGISMUNDA  Quick here bring AidAll in  Palermo  bring  Whose Skill can save HerAh that gentle Bosom  Pours fast the Streams of Life  SIGISMUNDA  All Aid is vain  I feel the powerful Hand of Death upon me  But O it sheds a Sweetness thro' my Fate  That I am thine again and without Blame  May in my TANCRED'S Arms resign my Soul  TANCRED  Oh Death is in that Voice so gently mild  So sadly sweet as mixes even with mine  The Tears of hovering AngelsMine again  And is it thus the cruel Fates have join'd Us  Are These the horrid Nuptials they prepare  For Love like ours Is Virtue thus rewarded  Let not my impious Rage accuse just Heaven  Thou TANCRED Thou hast murder'd SIGISMUNDA  That furious Man was but the Tool of Fate  I I the CauseBut I will do Thee Justice  On this deaf Heartâª that to thy tender Wisdom  Refus'd an EarYes Death shall soon unite us  SIGISMUNDA  Live live my TANCREDLet my Death suffice  To expiate all that may have been amiss  May it appease the Fates avert their Fury  From thy propitious Reign Meantime of me  And of thy Glory mindful live I charge Thee  To guard our Friends and make thy People happy  Observing  SIFFREDI  fixt in Astonishment and Grief  My FatherOh how shall I lift my Eyes  To Thee my sinking Father  SIFFREDI  Awful Heaven  I am chastis'dMy dearest Child  SIGISMUNDA  Where am I  A fearful Darkness closes all around  My Friends We needs must partI must obey  Th' imperious CallFarewel my LAURA cherish  My poor afflicted Father's AgeRODOLPHO  Now is the Time to watch th' unhappy King  With all the Care and Tenderness of Friendship  Oh my dear Father bow'd beneath the Weight  Of Age and Griefthe Victim even of Virtue  Receive my last AdieuWhere art thou TANCRED  Give me thy HandBut ahit cannot save me  From the dire King of Terrors whose cold Power  Creeps o'er my HeartOh  TANCRED  How these Pangs distract me  O lift thy gracious EyesThou leav'st me then  Thou leav'st me SIGISMUNDA  SIGISMUNDA  Yet a Moment  I had my TANCRED something more to say  Yesbut thy Love and Tenderness for me  Sure makes it needlessHarbour no Resentment  Against my Father venerate his Zeal  That acted from a Principle of Goodness  From faithful Love to TheeLive and maintain  My Innocence imbalm'd with holiest Care  Preserve my spotless MemoryI die  ETERNAL MERCY take my trembling Soul  Oh 'tis the only Sting of Death to part  From Those we lovefrom Theefarewel my TANCRED  Dies  TANCRED  Thus then  Flying to his Sword is held by  RODOLPHO  RODOLPHO  Hold hold my LordHave you forgot  Your SIGISMUNDA'S last Request already  TANCRED  Off Set me free Think not to bind me down  With barbarous Friendship to the Rack of Life  What Hand can shut the Thousand Thousand Gates  Which Death still opens to the Woes of Mortals  I shall find MeansNo Power in Earth or Heaven  Can force me to endure the hateful Light  Thus robb'd of all that lent it Joy and Sweetness  Off Traitors off or my distracted Soul  Will burst indignant from this Jail of Nature  To where she beckons yonderNo mild Seraph  Point not to LifeI cannot linger here  Cut off from Thee the miserable Pity  The Scorn of HumankindA trampled King  Who let his mean poorhearted Love one Moment  To coward Prudence stoop who made it not  The first undoubting Action of his Reign  To snatch Thee to his Throne and there to shield Thee  Thy helpless Bosom from a Ruffian's Fury  O Shame O Agony O the fell Stings  Of late of vain RepentanceHa my Brain  Is all on fire a wild Abyss of Thought  Th' infernal World discloses See behold him  Lo with fierce Smiles he shakes the bloody Steel  And mocks my feeble TearsHence quickly hence  Spurn his vile Carcass give it to the Dogs  Expose it to the Winds and screaming Ravens  Or hurl it down that siery Steep to Hell  There with his Soul to toss in Flames for ever  Ah Impotence of RageWhat am IWhere  Sad silent allThe Forms of dumb Despair  Around some mournful TombWhat do I see  This soft Abode of Innocence and Love  Turn'd to the House of Death a Place of Horror  Ah that poor Corse pale pale deformed with Murder  Is that my SIGISMUNDA  Throwing himself down by Her  SIFFREDI  After a pathetic Pause looking on the Scene before him  Have I liv'd  To these enfeebled Years by Heaven reserv'd  To be a dreadful Monument of Justice  RODOLPHO raise the King and bear him hence  From this distracting Scene of Blood and Death  Alas I dare not give him my Assistance  My Care would only more enflame his Rage  Behold the fatal Work of my dark Hand  That by rude Force the Passions would command  That ruthless sought to root them from the Breast  They may be rul'd but will not be opprest  Taught hence Ye Parents who from Nature stray  And the great Ties of social Life betray  Ne'er with your Children act a Tyrant's Part  'Tis your's to guide not violate the Heart  Ye vainly wise who o'er Mankind preside  Behold my righteous Woes and drop your Pride  Keep Virtue's simple Path before your Eyes  Nor think from Evil Good can ever rise  The END  EPILOGUE  Spoken by MISS BUDGELL  CRamm'd to the Throat with wholesome moral Stuff  Alas poor Audience you have had enough  Was ever hapless Heroine of a Play  In such a piteous Plight as ours Today  Was ever Woman so by Love betray'd  Match'd with two Husbands and yetdie a Maid  But bless meholdWhat Sounds are these I hear  I see the  TRAGIC MUSE  herself appear  The BackScene opens and discovers a romantic Silvan Landskip from which Mrs CIBBER in the Character of the TRAGIC MUSE advances slowly to Musick and speaks the following Lines  Hence with your flippant Epilogue that tries  To wipe the virtuous Tear from  BRITISH  Eyes  That dares my moral Tragic Scene profane  With Strainsat best unsuiting light and vain  Hence from the pure unsully'd Beams that play  In yon fair Eyes where Virtue shinesAway  BRITONS  to you from chaste  Castalian  Groves  Where dwell the tender oft unhappy Loves  Where Shades of Heroes roam each mighty Name  And court my Aid to rise again to Fame  To you I come to Freedom's noblest Seat  And in  BRITANNIA  fix my last Retreat  In  GREECE  and  ROME  I watch'd the Publick Weal  The purple Tyrant trembled at my Steel  Nor did I less o'er private Sorrows reign  And mend the melting Heart with softer Pain  On  FRANCE  and  YOU  then rose my brightning Star  With social RayThe  ARTS  are ne'er at War  O as your Fire and Genius stronger blaze  As yours are generous Freedom's bolder Lays  Let not the  Gallick  Taste leave yours behind  In decent Manners and in Life refin'd  Banish the motley Mode to tag low Verse  The laughing Ballad to the mournful Herse  When thro' five Acts your Hearts have learnt to glow  Touch'd with the sacred Force of honest Woe  O keep the dear Impression on your Breast  Nor idly lose it for a wretched Jest
