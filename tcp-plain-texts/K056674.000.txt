 A VIEW Of the real Dangers of the SUCCESSION FROM The Peace with  FRANCE  BEING A sober Enquiry into the SECURITIES proposed in the Articles of PEACE AND Whether they are such as the Nation ought to be satisfy'd with or no  London  Printed for  J Baker  at the  BlackBoy  in  PaterNosterRow  Price SixPence  A VIEW Of the real Dangers of the SUCCESSION FROM The Peace with  France  c  _THE  Protestant  Succession is a Thing of that Consequence to this Nation and upon which the Peace and Prosperity of the People does so entirely depend as from its Nature and Consequences very much justifies the Anxieties of our Minds about it this is the reason of most of that Uneasiness in the several publick Transactions which many People express for fear lest that Security for this Succession which we have so much depended upon should Suffer be Lessen'd Invaded or any way made Precarious  These Fears have been very much encreased among us and the common People render'd very Jealous by the publick Reports so frequent and so warmly spread among us of the Encrease of the  Pretender  's  Interest  the Concert between the  Friends  of the  Pretender  at Home and their  Confederates  Abroad particularly the terrible Accounts of the  French  Power which are now represented to us not only as Formidable but as also firmly Engaged to Assist and Reinstate the Interest and Title and Person of the  Pretender    Those have been the Reasons why many People have been so warm against the  Treaty of Peace with France  And indeed whatever may have been objected by the Friends of the Ministry against those Fears and Uneasinesses of the People about the  Peace  this must be own'd that if all that has been said on the other Side be true those Fears and Uneasinessess may be very rational No one can reasonably blame People for dislikeing the  Peace  if that  Peace  is calculated for bringing in the  Pretender  and by Consequence for overthrowing our  Protestant Settlement  on which our Religion Properties Liberties Trade and General Peace do entirely depend  As the Discontents on one Hand have been fomented or encreased upon those Suppositions as abovesaid  viz  that the  Peace  was ill  Made that there was no Security in  it  for the  Protestant Succession  that the  French  King was Strengthen'd by  it  to such a Degree as to make him more Dangerous than ever and that he was not discouraged by  it  from the  Jacobite Interest  so on the other Hand it was Confronted at first by little or nothing of Argument founded upon Fact But in general assuring the People that it was not so that the  Succession  was confirm'd the Power of  France  reduced the  Pretender  banish'd the  Succession  recognized and the like But nothing appearing on either Side the People remain'd fluctuating between various Uncertainties Influenc'd as to Hopes and Fears as their Parties their Instructers or rather Deceivers on both Sides prevail'd and as the Insinuations they offer'd work'd upon their Passions In this unfix'd Posture of Mens Minds it is no wonder if the Generallity of the People fall into the worst for Fear of Evil is so easily capable to prevail above the Hope of Good having natural Propensity always ready to fall into the Scale with it that it is not to be wonder'd at if the Reasoning part was overcome and we began Universally to distrust that the  Pretender  was hid in the Secret of the  Peace  and that the Treaty was but a  French  Mask to deceive the People  While the Treaty remain'd an Embrio Imperfect and Unfinish'd it could not be  expected that this Uncertainty on both Sides could be Master'd or that Satisfactory Arguments could be given either by one Party or other to confirm what they had alledged before and gain the People one Way or other  That  Difficulty  is now over the  Treaty  is finished the  Peace  made the  Ratifications  exchang'd and the  Articles  made publick It has been the receiv'd Opinion that the End and Design of Publications in such Cases is allow'd to be in order to general Satisfaction and we are thereby tacitly admitted to Reason upon Debate and Explain to one another the Substance and Meaning of the Treaty that we may know what it is we have obtain'd by the  War  what Confirm'd Gain'd and Established by the  Peace  and upon what Foundation of Security our  Liberties Religion  and  Estates  stand for the time to come To do this Calmly and Impartially is the Design of this Work and the End is the more just in that two Things of great Consequence are proposed to be included in the Design of doing it  If any Difficulties should offer as private Bystanding Judgments may sometimes give hints to publick Transactions which even the Persons acting however Wise might not foresee it may not be too late to obtain such Provision  against them or against the Consequences of them as may make up the Deficiencies  if any such were  in the first Part of the Conduct that so the Evil may be anticipated and the Dissatisfactions which attend such Things prevented  That if there are no Difficulties but that all Things are provided for sufficiently establish'd and the  Peace Liberty  and  Religion  of the Nation secured by all the needful and due Provision which was possible being made for the Safety and Certainty of the  Protestant Succession  People may be made duly Sensible of it their Doubts Fears Jealousies and Apprehensions be removed and the real Securities of their State placed in such a true Light that they may no more be capable of being made uneasy by Misrepresentations and Suggestions of Persons wickedly disposed  There are divers other good Ends and Purposes contain'd in a Design so useful as this of Discusing the  Articles of Peace  which perhaps may in the following Work be hinted at particularly the Stating and Examining into the real Power and Capacity of the  French  King to impose upon  Europe  after this  Peace  the Validity of the  Renunciations  of the  Spanish  King and the Probability which there is or is not before us that these Treaties shall be kept sacred by the  French  as they are like to be by us In brief the great question of the Validity of a Treaty as such with the  French  may be Examined as it respects not his Honour and Faith only which some People in Matters of  Peace  and  War  have been very free with but as it respects the Power and Influence the  British  Court may hereafter have in the World to enforce the Treaty and to do the Nation Justice on the Agressors in any Contraventions that may happen  In doing this an entire Impartiallity is necessary neither on the one Hand adhering too warmly to those Opinions who give up the Securities of this Treaty as entirely Void and Insignificant with respect to the Faith and Honour of the Parties we have Treated with and run down as Ridiculous and Absurd the Notion of  Britain  's holding the Ballance or being able to enforce the Performance in time to come And on the other Hand not altogether supposing that there is nothing of Danger either in the Will or Abillity of the  French  Court to make unjust Improvements and Advantages in breach of the Treaty hereafter  In order to come directly to the Case it is necessary to give the Reader an Abstract of what Provisions are really made in the  Treaty  with  France  for the Security of the  Protestant Succession  in  Great Britain  for that many who may perhaps see this Tract may not have seen the Treaty itself or may not have the Articles by them to refer to  I'll take no Advantage here of what however I do really believe  viz  That the Treaty is very surprizing to some People who having been made to believe that there was no Care taken in it for the  Protestant Succession  did not expect to find two such Articles as the Fourth and Fifth to be incerted in it and that they should be Worded in such a Manner And therefore before we proceed to Animadvert on that Opinion or to Examine whether that Surprize is just or whether the Objections others make against the Security of those Articles are sufficient to continue the general Dissatisfactions it will be necessary to place the Articles themselves in View as follows  IV Furthermore for adding a greater Strength to the Peace which is restored and to the faithful Friendship which is never to be violated and for cutting off all Occasions of distrust which might at any time arise from the established Right and Order of the Hereditary Succession to the Crown of  Great Britain  and the Limitation thereof by the Laws of  Great Britain  made and enacted in the Reigns  of the late King  William  the Third of glorious Memory and of the present Queen to the Issue of the abovesaid Queen and in default thereof to the most Serene Princess  Sophia  Dowager of  BrunswickHanover  and her Heirs in the Protestant Line of  Hanover  That therefore the said Succession may remain safe and secure the most Christian King sincerely and solemnly acknowledges the abovesaid Limitation of the Succession to the Kingdom of  Great Britain  and on the Faith and Word of a King on the Pledge of His own and His Successors Honour He does declare and engage That He accepts and approves the same and that His Heirs and Successors do and shall accept and approve the same for ever And under the same Obligation of the Word and Honour of a King the most Christian King promises That NO ONE besides the Queen Her Self and Her Successors according to the Series of the said Limitation shall ever by Him or by His Heirs or Successors be acknowledged or reputed to be King or Queen of  Great Britain  And for adding more ample Credit to the said Acknowledgment and Promises the most Christian King does engage That whereas the Person who in the Lifetime of the late King  James  the Second did take upon him  the Title of Prince of  Wales  and since his Decease that of King of  Great Britain  is lately gone of his own accord out of the Kingdom of  France  to reside in some other place He the aforesaid most Christian King His Heirs and Successors will take all possible Care that he shall not at any time hereafter or under any pretence whatsoever return into the Kingdom of  France  or any the Dominions thereof  V Moreover the most Christian King promises as well in His own name as in that of His Heirs and Successors That they will at no time whatever Disturb or give any Molestation to the Queen of  Great Britain  Her Heirs and Successors descended from the aforesaid Protestant Line who possess the Crown of  Great Britain  and the Dominions belonging thereunto Neither will the aforesaid most Christian King or any one of His Heirs give at any time any Aid Succour Favour or Council directly or indirectly by Land or by Sea in Money Arms Ammunition Warlike Provision Ships Soldiers Seamen or any other way to any Person or Persons whosoever they be who for any Cause or under any Pretext whatsoever should hereafter endeavour  to oppose the said Succession either by open War or by fomenting Seditions and forming Conspiracies against such Prince or Princes who are in Possession of the Throne of  Great Britain  by Virtue of the Acts of Parliament aforementioned or against that Prince or Princess to whom the Succession to the Crown of  Great Britain  shall be open according to the said Acts of Parliament  Immediately after these Two Articles follows the formal Renunciations of the King of  Spain  which as they are not within the Compass of our present Considerations so it will be needless to repeat them here neither will the narrow Compass of this Tract admit of it But it may not nevertheless be amiss to set down a few Words of the Introduction to those Renunciations as they seem to lay down the Foundation upon which the whole Treaty stands and upon which much of the present Peace and Security of  Europe  depends The Words are these  VI Whereas the most destructive Flame of War which is to be extinguished by this Peace arose chiefly from thence That the Security and Liberties of  Europe  could by no means bear the Union of the Kingdoms of  France  and  Spain  under  one and the same King And whereas it has at length been brought to pass by the Assistance of the Divine Power upon the most earnest Instances of Her Sacred Royal Majesty of  Great Britain  and with the Consent both of the most Christian and of the Catholick King that this Evil should in all times to come be obviated by means of Renunciations drawn in the most effectual Form and executed in the most solemn Manner  But to begin with the  Protestant Succession  as the main thing upon which our Eyes are fix'd in this Treaty and without which the whole is of very little Consequence to us And here it is necessary to lay down a short View of the Reasons and Foundation of the War which without doubt are to be also some part of the Reason and Foundation of the  Peace  or else the  War  will be no more to be justify'd than the  Peace  or the  Peace  to be thought adequate to the Necessity of the  War  The Reasons and Foundation of the  War  are abundantly express'd in the several Declarations made as well by the Queen and the late King  William  as by the several Princes and States their Confederates in which if the Safety of the  Protestant Interest  is laid down as the Thing most at Heart among the Confederates the same ought to be also the main Design or at least most Regarded in the  making a  Peace  for no  Peace  can be supposed to be effectual but such as answers the Ends of the  War  such as are squared to the Purposes which in the said Declarations of the  War  are laid down to be the just Reason for the Breach at the Beginning  In the Declaration of  War  against  France  Published in  England  by King  William  and Queen  Mary May  the th among divers other Reasons for the same it is express'd in these Words  And  lastly  as the said King of  France  has for divers Years past endeavoured by Insinuations and Promises of Assistance to Overthrow the Government of  England And in the Preamble to the said Declaration it is thus express'd  To the utmost to promote the Welfare of our People by preventing the Miseries which threaten them from Abroad  In the second Declaration of  War  against  France  enter'd into by Her Present Majesty and publish'd  May  the th The Reasons and Causes of the  War  are thus enumerated  The Exorbitant Power of  France  which must be reduced  The Alliances which  GreatBritain  stands engaged in particularly the Grand Alliance and that those Allies ought to have reasonable satisfaction  And especially the following Particulars  The  French  King has not only proceeded to farther Violence but has added thereunto a great Affront and Indignity to us and our Kingdoms in taking upon him to declare the pretended Prince of  Wales  King of  England Scotland  and  Ireland  and has also Influenced  Spain  to concur in the same Affront and Indignity as well as in other Oppressions Wherafore we find our selves oblig'd for maintaining the publick Faith for Vindication of the Honour of our Crown and to prevent the Mischiefs which all  Europe  is threatned with to declare War  c Vide the Declaration  These being the proposed Reasons and the just Occasions of the present War there seems several Arguments to occur here which I shall mention previous to the ensuing Discourse  If the  French  King's owning and receiving the Prince of  Wales  as King of  England c  was a just Ground of the  War  the revoking that Acknowledgment disowning him as such recognizing Her Majesty's Rightful and Lawful Title to the Crown and securing as much as could be required of him that Title and Her Majesty's quiet Possession  thereof ought to be a Capital Consideration of the  Peace  otherwise the End for which the  War  was begun was not sufficiently answer'd the Repose of  Europe  not atall obtain'd by the Treaty the Queen's Honour sufficiently repair'd or the Affront given made amends for  If the  French  King's bare Owning and Receiving the  Pretender  as King of  Great Britain  was made a sufficient Foundation of the War though he had then made no Effort for his Establishment or had any way attempted to place him on the Throne then the said  French  King retracting the said Owning and Recieving  c  and promising as by the Treaty of Peace Article the th he does on the Faith and Word of a King  c  Never to Receive him again or any way to Aid or Assist him  c  in Disturbing Her Majesty or Her Successors in the Line of  Hanover  is as much Security as could be ask'd of the  French  King and may be taken in full Satisfaction of that Particular till  France  makes some visible Infraction of that Engagement  For the first of these that the King of  France  Revoking  c  the Acknowledgment  he had made of the  Pretender  and Recognizing  c  the Queen and the Succession ought to be a Capital Consideration of the Peace there seems to be no occasion to enter into any Debate about it especially since the King of  France  has yielded to the Justice of it in Expressions so full and to the utmost Extent of all that could be desired as appears by the Fourth Article But it is chiefly mention'd here as matter of Wonder that any among us should object against the Measures taken at the Beginning and indeed thro' the Progress of this Treaty as if the most solemn Recognitions of Her Majesty's Title to the Crown and of the Establish'd Succession in the Protestant Line of  Hanover  could be forgotten  And first the Objection as it was formerly made against the Six Proposals of  France  called however mistakenly  Preliminaries viz That the  French  King did not sufficiently Acknowledge the Queen's Rightful and Lawful Title to the Crown  This I think ought to be answer'd in the same manner that the  Germans  at this time reply to the Proposals of Peace made by  France  to the Emperor where the  French  King offers it as an Article that he will acknowledge the Emperor as such I say it ought to be answer'd in the same Manner  viz  with Contempt  signifying That the Imperial Crown having not the least dependence upon the Vote Suffrage or Acknowledgment of the King of  France  they can by no means make his Acknowledging or not Acknowledging the Election of the Person of his Imperial Majesty to that Crown to be an Article of a Treaty or accept of such his Acknowledgment as any Condition of Peace But that his bare Treating of Peace with his Imperial Majesty as it is necessarily attended with such Acknowledgment so his Imperial Majesty cannot be Treated with under any other Title Figure or Denomination For Example that it would be absur'd to treat with an ArchDuke of  Austria  in the Affairs and Properties of the Imperial Crown or with the Empire in the Matter of the Rights and Succession of the House of  Austria    Thus in the Case of Her Majesty's Rightful Possession of the Regal Titles and Sovereign Authority of  Great Britain  there was no need to Capitulate with the  French  King to acknowledge Her Majesty in the usual Forms for that the Crowns of  Great Britain  and  Ireland  and the Succession of Her Majesty having no manner of Dependence upon the  French  King or the  French  Government or upon any Vote Suffrage or Recognition on the part of  France  to be  made It would derogate from the Honour of the  British  Nation from the Personal Right of Her Majesty and the Authority of Parliament to accept of any such Recognition of the Queen's Title from the King of  France  as any Condition Article or Preliminary to an Article in any Treaty whatsoever But that in the very Act of Treating such Recognition is so effectually supply'd and contain'd that nothing can be more compleat since the  French  King cannot commence any Treaty but in the Name of Her Majesty and with Her Majesty in Person as represented by Her Plenipotentiaries Clothed with all the Royal Stile and Dignity Titles and Appellations which attend the Persons of the Kings and Queens of  Great Britain  which Names Stile Titles Appellations and Dignities are of meer Course and by the Usage and Custom of all Treaties always express'd in the very first Powers produced by the Ministers and Ambassadors of each Prince or Sovereign so Treating and accepted by the other and after that are again necessarily repeated in the very Title and Introduction to such Treaty or Agreement which shall afterward be made and as is for Example in the several Treaties as well of Peace as of Commerce now under Consideration in these Words in Latin and in English  Tractatus Pacis Amicitiae inter Serenissimam ac Potentissimam Principem  Annam  Dei Gratiâ  magnae Britanniae Franciae    Hiberniae  Reginam  In Inglish thus  A Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the most Serene and most Potent Princess  Anne  by the Grace of God Queen of  Great Britain France  and  Ireland  Mark the King of  France  here owns Her Majesty to be Queen of  Great Britain  c and that She is so by the GRACE OF GOD not atall supposing Her Title depended upon his Recognition or received any confirmation thereby  Having then acknowledged Her Majesty to be Rightful and Lawful Queen of  Great Britain  the  French  King could make no Scruple of coming into the rest  viz  to acknowledge the Succession of the House of  Hanover  which is a Consequence of the Revolution upon which as the Occasion Her present Majesty's Right of Possession is built and which is settled upon the Basis of Parliamentary Limitation which Parliamentary Authority is the Rightful and Lawful  Power among others from which Her Majesty's Right of Claim immediately proceeds  Having also acknowledg'd the  Protestant  Succession recognized the Authority that Establish'd it and own'd the  Protestant  Race of  Hanover  to be the only Rightful and Lawful Heir to the  British  Crown the rest fell in as natural Consequences  viz First  That he should Expunge Disown and Banish from his Dominions the Person of the  Pretender  engaging never to admit him to come again into his Kingdoms And  Secondly  That he should in the solemnest Manner possible engage never to Aid or Assist him or any one for him directly or indirectly in making any Claim to the Crown of  Great Britain  or in offering any Disturbance either to Her Majesty's Possession or to the  Hanover  Succession as it is Established by the  British  Parliament  Let us then enquire how this is done and in what manner expressed that the great Question may afterwards come to be clearly Discuss'd  viz What Security this is to the  Protestant  Succession  The Words of the Article are as strongly express'd and as full as can be devised And  I hear many People express themselves with an agreeable Surprize that it is so for tho' all that is alledg'd of the Perfidy and Disingenuous Principles of the  French  King were to be acknowledg'd yet since Verbal Assurances are sometimes to be taken and perhaps no other can be obtain'd in some things of which this is one it is as satisfactory as the Nature of the Thing will allow that those Verbal Assurances be full and compleat  The Nature of Treaties is now such and the Conduct of Princes Abroad is allow'd such a Latitude that in some respect it may be said of all Treaties nothing is to be Depended on but what either you have Power to Enforce or the other gives sufficient Security to Perform  Thus where Security could be obtain'd in this Affair of the Treaty Her Majesty made a demand of such Security that she might be in a Condition to Enforce the Execution As for Example The  French  King Offers on a Peace to Demolish  Dunkirk How shall I be sure of that  says Her Majesty  Will you put it into my Hands immediately that I may have Power to see that Promise put in Execution  The  French  King Consents so that now the Queen of  Great  Britain  demolishes  Dunkirk  not the  French  King that is She holds it in Possession till it is done and Her Forces are to Encamp in the Neighbourhood to see the Execution  It is but too well known a Truth that there are some People besides the  Jacobites  who are surpriz'd and illpleased to see this Affair so remarkably settled by the Treaty and that the  French  King has thereby stoop'd to such Declarations and Protestations against the Interest of the  Pretender  And these are those who for other Ends had much rather have been furnish'd from the Articles themselves with sufficient Grounds of Complaint that the  Protestant  Succession had been neglected and the Interest of the  Pretender  had not been sufficiently Weakned and Discourag'd Such a Complaint being in its Nature very Essential to the Publick Good and to the Establishment of Things in this Nation would have been very Popular and would have been capable of many ways of Improvement to the Advantage of those who study to keep the People uneasie and distemper'd about the Publick Management of Affairs and to whom nothing has contributed so much as the Notion of the Danger of the  Pretender    The Complaints of these People have been so loud that no one could have thought but that they really knew what  France  was acting in this Affair and that even in the Articles themselves there had appear'd more Foundation for their Dissatisfactions it was no more question'd by those who supposed all those Complaints were well Grounded I say it was no more question'd but that when the Articles came to be made Publick it would appear that the Succession of  Hanover  was very slightly taken Notice of and that room was left for the Interest of the  Pretender  to be carry'd on so that the  French  King might at any time after the Queen was Deceased concern himself in that Matter without any dammage to his Honour and Faith and any Branch of his Treaty with the Queen to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding  But I do not find upon a serious Revising the Articles but that these People the first movers of those Complaints only excepted are under very great Disappointments upon the Articles first appearing in Publick nay the most Angry have not yet been able to find the least Fault in the Recognitions and Provisions made either on the Part of the  French  or on Our Part for the Security of the House of  Hanover  or to say what they  could have demanded of the  French  King more than is Granted by the Treaty with respect to that Particular The Truth of the Case being this that the  French  King was not able to do more or was it Honourable for the  British  Plenipotentiaries to ask more of him in that Particular  It might be thought some Testimonial to the Validity of these Articles That the  Jacobites  in  Great Britain  are so universally Thunderstruck with them that there is so profound a Silence thro' the whole Nation among them nothing is heard from them of the usual Boasts they have for some time made of their Growing Interest and of the great Assistance their Prince should receive upon any Occasion for the Establishing him on the Throne of  Great Britain  Whereas now nothing is heard among them but very secret and private Reproaches and Reflections upon the  French  King for suffering himself to yield to such severe Conditions and so effectually to bind himself against the Interest of their Prince as they call him as never to Assist him after the Queen's Death and never to admit him to return into  France  again  These Complaints I say are very secretly and softly express'd among them too  for they cannot without manifest Ingratitude complain of any one Step the  French  King has taken they cannot deny without the Reproaches of the whole World but that the  French  King has gone a greater Length for the Propagation of the  Jacobite  Interest in  Great Britain  than any Prince in the World could have done and has done more for them than all the  Popish  Powers in the World would have done The hazard of a Ruinous  War  undertaken for the Restoring King  James  II and carry'd with no other View thro' innumerable Disasters to the  Peace  of  Ryswick  the Undertaking this second  War  under that disadvantageous Step to  France  of Acknowledging the present  Pretender  as King of  Great Britain  which justly Enflam'd and Provok'd this Nation to such a Degree as to make all the Parts of the Island Address the late King  William  to renew the  War  which otherwise the Nation at that time were not much inclin'd to These things attempted by the King of  France  for the  Jacobite  Interest leave the Friends of the  Pretender  no room to Exclaim against him as otherwise they would have done as a Man abandoning his Friend  On the contrary to reckon the divers Attempts Hazards Losses and Expence  the  French  King has been at in Behalf of the  Pretender  and of King  James  II would be to Write the greatest Panegyrick upon the Friendship Constancy and Generosity of the King of  France  that could possibly be Written In which the Armies sent into  Ireland  to his Relief the Loss of his Fleet at  La Hogue  the Attempt upon  Scotland  the constant Expence of Supporting the Court of St  Germans  and all its Hangers on and Dependencies for above Twenty Four Years must come to be reckon'd up all which being consider'd it is but in silent Murmurs that the  Jacobites  can complain of the  French  King for giving up the Cause of the  Pretender  as he has done  On the other Hand his own Circumstances tell them plainly that he has espoused their Cause as long as he was able to support himself and that his Affairs were reduc'd to that Extremity that he could no longer carry on the  War  with safety nor could he make any  Peace  without relinquishing entirely a Prince and an Interest which he was not able to support  These things stop their Mouths I say as to Complaint and therefore they testify their Surprize and Despair by a profound Silence which Silence also tacitly acknowledges  that they look upon the Acknowledgments and Recognitions made by the  French  King of the  Hanover  Succession to be too effectual a Blow to their Interest in  Britain  which on the other Hand is an Argument to us to look upon it as some Security to the said Succession  With the Silence of the  Jacobites  Party and as a Consequence thereof the Fears and Apprehensions of Honest and Wellminded People abate also I mean of such People who being guided by no PartyInterest kept their Eyes only upon the Publick Good yet were made uneasie and alarm'd by the continued Suggestions of others that the Ministry and even the Queen Herself were in the Interest of the  Pretender  It might take up some room here to Convince you that such People were made Uneasie and by what Method on what Account by Whom and for what Reason But I am willing to forget those Things the remembrance whereof serve only to promote that which will help to Divide us and to make us yet Uneasie to one another  That many good People were alarm'd with the Notion of the  Pretender  being at hand and possess'd with a belief that the Ministry and the  French  King were in Concert  for the Restoring him in these Kingdoms This is what needs no Evidence the very Insolence of the  Jacobites  as it was given for a Reason of their Apprehensions so it was a Confirmation of the Arguments others had used for the raising those Jealousies and Apprehensions in the People  They were told that the Ministry encourag'd and employ'd none but  Jacobites  that the profess'd Friends of the  Pretender  had distinguishing Marks of Favour show'd them that even the Dialect spoken at Court was different from what used to be the Language in the Case of the Succession that Addresses were presented in which not only the House of  Hanover  was not mentioned but in which the Interest of the  Pretender  was expresslly recommended and that yet such Addresses were equally accepted and received equally Graciously with others that the greatest Insolences of several Persons upon the Name of  Hanover  and the  Protestant Succession  were left Unpunished and the like  The Business of the  Hanover  Memorial was in the next Place mention'd and the Resentments express'd by the Queen and Ministry at the Publication thereof with several other Things which were call'd to  mind to confirm the Suspicions and to perswade the People here that the same Affection which promoted the Settlement of the Crown upon that House was not now to be found among us  c  While the Treaty of Peace was in Agitation these Suspitions encreased and it was expected by some that the Interest of the  Pretender  was in immediate agitation that the  French  Influence having a Governing Power among us would not fail to attempt that by Treaty which they had so often and so long attempted in the Field by the Sword  It was a happy surprize then to such People as these to find the aforesaid Articles Incerted in the Treaty of  Peace  where the most they could expect in favour of the Succession was that nothing expresly on the other Side should be incerted and that the  French  King should be prevail'd with to leave the  Pretender  to his own Fortunes and to say nothing of him nay some People would have thought this a great deal and would even have compounded with us for such a Thing as a Favour to the Succession of  Hanover  which they had scarce reason to expect  What then could such People say when they found the utmost Care taken and the strongest Engagements enter'd into with the  French  King for the  Protestant Succession  and the Recognizing upon all Occasions the House of  Hanover  as the Rightful and Lawful Successor to the Crown  What could they say but acknowledge themselves Surpriz'd Satisfy'd and Pleas'd as also that they had been impos'd upon before When they found the  French  King brought to Compliment the Queen of  Great Britain  with the solemn and declar'd Expulsion of the Person of the  Pretender  from not the Succession of  Britain  only but even from the Dominions of  France  and engaging to make that Expulsion Perpetual and that he shall never be admitted to set his Foot within the Kingdom of  France  again  Would any Man have thought that the King of  France  who had formerly acted so avowedly in the Interest of the  Pretender  and had voluntarily brought down upon his Kingdom so heavy a War by the meer declaring him by the Titles of  Britain  who had made such Efforts for him and had Promised never to forsake his Interest till he had established him on the Throne would  be brought so entirely to give him up so effectually to relinquish his Interest and Concerns as to engage never to Own him again by those Titles which he himself had before acknowledged to him  These Things having been so openly declar'd against before by the  French  King it was the more Rational to expect that the Party here might have been prevail'd upon and Influenced by the  French  to have Countenanced that Interest or at least to have contented themselves with very moderate Provisions against him and till the contrary appear'd there was too much force in their Reasoning the other way not to take with the People whose Minds were already prejudiced as abovesaid  But when the Articles appear these People seem'd surpriz'd began to exclaim at the Injustice done the present Ministry and to approve of what was done in behalf of the  Hanover  Succession till they met with new Scruples and Suggestions in order to keep up the Temper of Complaint and to bring the Notions of the Danger of the  Pretender  into play again and these were the ill Opinions which Common Fame had deeply Imprinted in the Minds of the People of the  French  King being to the last Degree Perfidious  that he made no Scruple of breaking in upon the most sacred Engagement when ever his Ambition Avarice Superstition of especially Thirst of Glory prompted that he made no farther Use of Treaties and Postulations Articles and solemn Conventions than to amuse and separate the Conjunction and Confederacies of his Enemies and made it his constant avow'd Practice or Maxim to keep the most sacred Engagements of Treaties no longer than till he had the Opportunity to break them to his Advantage and much more to this Purpose  From these Things they ask us now what signify all the Treaties and Engagements which the  French  King has made in the Affair of the  Protestant Succession  and what Dependance can we or ought we to have upon them  Now it is a Mistake if any Reader expects to find this Tract attempting to take off any of the above Reproaches cast upon the Honour and Character of the  French  King his regard to his Word or holding sacred the Engagements he has enter'd intoNot at all This shall be no part of my Task let it go let it be taken all for granted if they please or not taken for granted as you shall please But the two Questions  to be ask'd here and which contains the whole of the Case are these  What more could be done by the  French  King to secure us against him or give us Satisfaction in his future Conduct with relation to the  Pretender    How with safety to the Honour and Reputation of our Arms could we aledge that our Safety against the  Pretender  was not sufficiently secured by this  What more could be done by the  French  King to secure us against him or give us Satisfaction in his future Conduct with relation to the  Pretender  This Question has been ask'd before now and so many abrupt and absurd Answers have been given to it that even the Persons who have given those Answers desire not to have the Question repeated and are willing to hear as little of it as they can Some have answer'd the  French  King should have deliver'd him up to us But this is liable to many Exceptions and to speak in general only the best Friends of the House of  Hanover  have declared they did not desire to have that Method taken as  a dangerous Experiment for many Reasons some of them fitter to be guess'd at than express'd Some have suggested That the  French  King should have caused him to be made away privately rather than to have suffered himself to be brought to so Dishonourable a Submission as to Forsake and Abandon a Person who had from his Infancy been shelter'd under his Protection But this was too Barbarous and Unhospitable for even the worst Enemies of the  Pretender  if they were Christians to approve of and no one could maintain it without Horror even at the same time that they were for entirely Expelling him from hence Others suggested That we should have procur'd him to be Confin'd in the  Pierre Encise  in  France  where Prisoners for Life are generally sent near  Lyons  and that he should be suffer'd there to end his Days quietly But this was liable to the same Objections of the  French  King's breaking his Word that the present Articles are liable too since he might cause the Gates to be Opened when ever he thought fit and might let him out from thence with the same Ease that he may now Recall him into his Dominions  What then can we propose that the King of  France  could have done in respect  to the Disposing the Person of the  Pretender  more than first having caused him or desired him  call it as you please  Voluntarily to withdraw out of his Dominions to engage in the solemnest manner not to admit him to Return thither any more and no more to own him for ever hereafter under the Titles of King of  England Scotland  and  Ireland  King of  Great Britain  or in short any of Her Majesty's Titles and Royal Stile as he did before  It is true The  French  King may break his Word may renounce the Faith and Honour of a King pledg'd to Her Majesty and the Faith and Honour of the very Throne of  France  which he has engaged as far as in him lies in the Name of all his Successors and there is no helping this But I do not see what farther could be done what more could have been asked of the King of  France  or what more he could have granted to have made us more safe  Pledges of Towns Possession of Frontiers and Cautionary Garisons could be of no signification here neither did ever any one of the other Opinion say what Town or City they would accept as a  sufficient Caution or Pledge for the Security of his Performance Nor indeed could any thing the  French  King possesses have given us the least Security in such a Case On the contrary had any of the Possessions of the Kingdom of  France  been made over in a way of Security or as a Preliminary for the performance of this Negative and to assure us That he never would Assist or Entertain this  Pretender  again This would even itself have been a most forcible Motive to the  French  King to have broke that very Engagement and to have made the Attempt that having set him up here and obtain'd the Possession of the  English  or  British  Crown for him He  the Pretender  should clear him  the  French  King  of those Engagements and restore to him those Pledges  Nor in such a Case would there have lain so much of the Charge of a breach of Honour or a Charge of Perfidiousness since he that takes Security is supposed not to depend upon the Promise or Engagement but relinquishing the Honour of the Person takes the Equivalent  viz  the Pledge for his Satisfaction  What then any Ambassador or Plenipotentiaries could have ask'd more than  the present Treaty has taken Or indeed what could have been proposed farther to the  French  King to have done for our Security and Satisfaction in this Case remains for any to set down that knows for I do not pretend to it  How with safety to the Honour and Reputation of our Arms could we aledge that our Safety against the  Pretender  was not sufficiently secured by this  The Safety of  Britain  must be esteem'd by us to be very weakly Defended and our Establishment to be in a very precarious Condition if we may suppose it to depend so entirely upon the  French  King's performance of his Engagements as that without it we are given up and lost to the  Pretender  Those who are thus Flegmatick in the Case of the  Protestant Succession  very much Dishonour their own Country and the Confidence they have either in the Power or Unanimity of the People of  Great Britain  that they should think we should be so much at the Mercy of the  French  King that when ever he pleases to break his Engagements we are to be subdued to the Interest of the  Pretender    It is true The Interest of the  Pretender    back'd by the Power of the  French  King is not to be dispised nor the Danger of it to be made light of and therefore every thing that is reasonable and practicable ought to be done to keep that Apprehension off And the Treaty has made so much Provision that whether it be sufficient or no it seems to be all that the Nature of the Case would admit of and all that was really practicable in the Thing To be Flegmatick and Dismay'd now would suggest to us that our own Power is of no weight in this Case that we must depend entirely upon the Conduct of the  French  King to preserve the  Succession  and that we are to be Happy or Miserable just as he is or is not pleased to be faithful to his Engagement  This I must acknowledge I think is Complimenting the  French  King too much at our own Expence and placing the  British  Strength at so low an Ebb as no reason can be given for  Britain  or the People of  Britain  no doubt were we Hearty and Unanimous in the Interest of the Nation are able to keep up the Resolutions already taken in the Affair of the  Succession  and are able to Support our own Laws and Constitution  against the whole World And tho' it is highly reasonable that on a Treaty the  French  King should engage as he has done to relinquish the  Pretender  and acknowledge the Successor yet our Safety is very far from depending entirely on the Performance of that Engagement and we ought to be in very little Concern whether the  French  King will perform his Promises or not  The Question therefore does not so much rest upon this Point whether the  French  King will perform the Treaty he has made or no but whether any thing farther could have been done for our Security or no in a Treaty whether with the  French  King or anybody else what the  French  King could have granted farther or what we could Honourably to our selves have demanded farther that we may see if the People that mady the Treaty have been faithful or no  I shall readily grant that if our Security depends upon the  French  King's performance of his Promises and Engagements the  Protestant Succession  may be a very precarious Thing The Faith and Honour of the best Princes in the World being too weak a Basis to build a Thing of that Consequence upon especially while according  to the present Practices the Faith and Honour of Treaties are always Interpreted by Princes their own way when they have any Pretensions to make or find it for their Conveniency to break in upon their Word given  And for this Reason those People who lay so great a stress upon our Treaty with  France  and place so much weight there as if the whole and only Security of our  Protestant Settlement  depended upon this Treaty not only Dishonour our own Nation but really Weaken the  Succession  itself Do such People know or consider that the  Protestant Succession  is our Fundamental Security for the  Peace Prosperity Liberty Property Religion Posterity  of this Nation and all that is or can be dear to us or them now and for ever What a Condition should we be all in if these Things of so much Consequence to us depended for their Safety upon the Veracity Faith and Honour of the  French  King aye or any King upon Earth Such People have too mean an Opinion of our Constitution and of our Power to maintain it It is no doubt convenient and safe for us to tye up the Hands of those who are Enemies to the  Succession  as far as possible And it seems to be as much done that way as it was  possible could be done in the Treaty But when all that is over we hope the Security of our Establishment has better Foundations than any that could be furnished from Foreign Contracts or provided in a Treaty with  France    As far as Treaty could provide as far as could either be offer'd by the  French  King or proposed by us in a Treaty seems to be Obtain'd and Settled by this Treaty and it is yet unknown what those People who complain of the Insufficiency of this Treaty do propose either as what might have been done or as what would have been sufficient if it had been done in the Treaty I mean as it relates to the  Protestant Succession    If then nothing can be thought of farther for the Security of the  Protestant Succession  which either was in the Power of the  French  King to grant or which we ought to have accepted from him or proposed to him then the present Treaty is as sufficient a Security to the  Succession  as it was possible to make it be or as a Treaty could admit  The same Thing might be said in the Case of the  Spanish  Renunciations which  lay it down as a Foundation that  France  and  Spain  ought to be joyn'd together in the same Person since then the Possessor King  Philip  was not driven Out and that yet it appear'd necessary to make a Treaty of Peace on all Sides Nothing more effectual could be devised or proposed than those Renunciations And however Invalid Renunciations have been in like Cases thro' the Accidents that may have happen'd yet upon a due Examination it will appear that such Formal Proceedings are not esteem'd so very Insufficient as we now make them or so appointed to be broken as that they cannot be kept and in the Prosecution of this Argument there shall be shewn in due time  That the present Renunciations are of a different kind from all that ever were proposed in an Affair of the like Nature as far as History can instruct us in the Case  That there is something in the Nature of the Thing that makes these Valid and that tho' all the former Contracts of the like Nature in the World have or had proved ineffectual yet that these cannot do so  That King  William  accepted of Renunciations in Cases of like Nature as the only Method to bind Princes in Cases where other Obligations could not be taken or given  But these Things are reserved to
