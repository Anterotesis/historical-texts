well  Poet  I have not seen you long how goes the world  Pain  It wears Sir as it goes  Poet  Ay that's well known  But what particular rariety what so strange  Which manifold record not matches see  Jeweller and Merchant enter other Suitors pass over the Stage  Magick of bounty all these spirits thy power  Hath conjur'd to attend I know the merchant  Pain  I know them both th' other's a jeweller  Mer  O 'tis a worthy Lord  Jew  Nay that's most fixt  Mer  A most incomparable man breath'd as it were  To an untirable and continuate goodness  Jew  I have a jewel here  Mer  O pray let's see't  For the Lord  Timon  Sir  Jew  If he will touch the estimate but for that  Exeunt Merchant and Jeweller  Poet  to himself  When we for recompence have praised the vile  It stains the glory in that happy verse  Which aptly sings the good  Pain  You're rapt Sir in some work some dedication  To the great Lord  Poet  A thing slipt idly from me  Our poesie is a gum which issues  From whence 'tis nourished  What have you there  Pain  A picture Sirand when comes your book forth  Poet  Upon the heels of my presentment Sir  Let's see your piece  Pain  'Tis a good piece  Poet  So 'tis  This comes off well and excellent  Pain  Indiff'rent  Poet  Admirable how this grace  Speaks his own standing what a mental power  This eye shoots forth how big imagination  Moves in this lip to th' dumbness of the gesture  One might interpret  Pain  It is a pretty mocking of the life  Here is a touchis't good  Poet  I'll say of it  It tutors nature artificial strife  Lives in those touches livelier than life  Enter certain Senators and pass on  Pain  How this Lord is followed  Poet  The Senators of  Athens  happy man  Pain  Look more  Poet  You see this confluence this great flood of visiters  I have upon a high and pleasant hill  Feign'd  Fortune  to be thron'd The base o' th' mount  Is rank'd with all deserts all kind of natures  That labour on the bosom of this sphere  To propagate their states amongst them all  Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixt  One do I personate of  Timon  's frame  Whom  Fortune  with her iv'ry hand wafts to her  Whose present grace to present slaves and servants  Translates his rivals  Pain  'Tis conceiv'd to th' scope  This throne this fortune and this hill methinks  With one man beckon'd from the rest below  Bowing his head against the steepy mount  To climb his happiness would be well exprest  In our condition  Poet  Nay but hear me on  When  Fortune  in her shift and change of mood  Spurns down her late belov'd all his dependants  Which labour'd after to the mountain's top  Even on their knees and hands let him slip down  Not one accompanying his declining foot  Pain  'Tis common  A thousand moral paintings I can shew  That shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortune  More pregnantly than words Yet you do well  To shew Lord  Timon  that mean eyes have seen  The foot above the head  SCENE II  Flourish of Trumpets Timon

must needs dine togetherSir your jewel  Hath suffer'd under praise  Jew  What my Lord dispraise  Tim  A meer satiety of commendations  If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd  It would unclew me

Right welcome Sir  E'er we do part we'll share of bounteous time  In diff'rent pleasure Pray you let us in  Exeunt  Manet  Apemantus  Apem  O you gods what a number of men eat  Timon  and he sees 'em

Then war farewel  " Take they who will the chearless trade of arms  " I envy not such honourable folly  Evan  " Yes you have words to make each cause your own  " Lips which your master  Socrates  has tun'd  " To sounds that soften and persuade the soul  " Oh you're an apt disciple  Alc  " You mistake me  " I am no courtier have no wit no cunning  " To wrap your heart in flattery's silken snare  "

rude wild country to a considerable extent with the ruins of a temple to  Faunus Timon  is discovered at the extremity of the stage led in by  Flavius  At the same time  Evanthe  enters at the front surveys him some time and while he slowly advances speaks  Evan  " O spectacle of sorrow Mighty Gods  " Is that my fatheris that mournful ruin  " That bare and blasted trunk the spreading vine  " Beneath whose shade late a whole nation sat  " And feasted from its branches Hold my heart  " Sink not my knees beneath your weight of woe  " But bear me to his feetMy Lord my father  She kneels  Tim  " Rise rise my daughterdo I once again  " Enfold thee in my arms Alas my child  " I'm old and weak and smitten sore with grief  " Gods how ingratitude lays waste your works  " Unkindness like another deadly plague  " Strikes all below the moon creation groans  " Nature with more than mother's pangs brings forth  " Her thankless offspring man  Evan  " All shall be well  Tim  " All all is well for thou art in my sight  " Mute as these scenes and calm as summer seas  " Here will we sit and meditate a while  " Then die and be at peace  Evan  Oh talk not thus  Tim  " Give me your pardon I have suffer'd much  " And much I fear sorrow has shook my wits  " But in the bitterest moments of affliction  " I have remember'd still to bless my child  Evan  " O bless me not in part compleat my joy  " Return to me to  Athens  to thyself  " And these base emblems of thy discontent  " Like the  Nessean  garment cast away  " And be at peace with a repentant world  Tim  " Can I who from the depth of hell have call'd  " Malignant spirits to ensnare mankind  " I who each night upon the lonely strand  " By the sea brink or in this silent waste  " Have stood and bandied curses to the moon  " Till the grey dawn look'd out can I now teach  " That voice which execration has made hoarse  " The smooth soft notes of peace will nature pardon  " That common mother in whose patient bosom  " I have stuck iron goadsIt will not be  Flav  " Move him no more dear Lady 'tis in vain  Tim  " Yet I had causeSpeak  Flavius  thou art honest  " And wilt not flatter had I not full cause  Flav  " May the just Gods who know thy wrongs revenge 'em  Tim  " Hush hush no more of thatWe must be calm  " Shatter'd with storms at length I see my port  " And stretch for death's calm shoreRejoice my child  " Thy father's sufferings hasten to an end  " And life and care shall terminate together  Eva  Alas my father talk not in this strain  " Bright years of glory rise to crown thy hopes  " Great  Alcibiades  defends thy cause  " The suppliant Senate come to kiss thy feet  " Loaded with treasure while repentant  Athens  " From all her gates pours forth unnumber'd crouds  " To hail thy glad return  Tim  " Why let them come  " Shou'd  Alcibiades  to please old  Timon  " Burn  Athens  to a heap crush the proud Senate  " And swallow that vile swarm of summer friends  " That left him bare to shame shall  Timon  say  " I thank thee Sir for this great courtesy  " Shall man say this to man who in pure love  " And singleness of heart ne'er stirs his hand  " To aid his suffering fellow  Evan  " Nay that's hard  Tim  " Rather let  Timon  say I have a daughter  " Beauteous and young and fair as unsun'd lilies  " Your eye has drank her charms and strong desire  " Knocks at your heart therefore let  Athens  burn  " Spare not a man that e'er spake  Timon  's name  " But in the way of worshipOh 'tis great  " 'Tis glorious friendship in his daughter's arms  Evan  " That daughter is no idle wanton Sir  " To doat on every form that courts the eye  " Tho' nature fashion'd him with every grace  " Which the joint bounty of the Gods cou'd give him  " Yet  Alcibiades  had pass'd unnoticed  " With  Lucius  and  Lucullus  and the herd  " Of common flatterers were he that base thing  " Which your description paints him  Tim  " Soft you now  " He is a man and  Flavius  is no more  " Yet he is honest and you'll say another  " May be so tooTwo honest men ye Gods  " Can there be two I know you can do much  " Ye great Divinities therefore I say  " It may be so but mark me well my child  " I vouch it not that were indeed too much  Evan  " Does Heav'n cloath falsehood in celestial robes  " See where he comes Who can survey that form  " And doubt if honour dwells in such a shrine  " Yes in each glance each gesture it appears  " Lives in his tongue and lightens in his eye  " Pervades inspires and occupies his soul  Alcibiades  enters  Alcib  " Health to thee noble  Timon  health and fame  " Peace and fair fortune The  Athenian  Senate  " Stung with remorse and shame present themselves  " Entreating your return with them to  Athens  Tim  " Say to the Senate you have seen me die  "  Timon  is now no more here lies their prey  He sinks down on the steps of the temple being supported in his fall by  Evanthe  and  Flavius  " The stout old hart they have cours'd so long in view  " Dead dead you see and fairly hunted down  Alcid  " Much injured  Timon  they have seen their faults  " Their former thriftiness they have cast from them  " And now their coffers like their hearts stand open  " To your free use  Tim  " Alas kind hearted men  " Oh they are cunning murderers fine the wound  " And hard to trace where sharp unkindness strikes  " Therefore they say I am not struck at all  " But Heav'n rejects their plea and in my heart  " Sees the dire arrow rankle  Alcib  " Live oh live  " Shake off despair and live most worthy  Timon  " See on all sides my Soldiers fence thee round  "  Athens  I've humbled to thy meanest use  " And driv'n to shameful flight that loathsome crew  " Whose black ingratitude corrodes thy heart  Tim  " And what in recompence can  Timon  give  " To  Alcibiades  Alcib  " More than the Gods did  " When they gave life thou can'st bestow  Evanthe  Evan  " O  Alcibiades  forbear to urge  " At this sad hour thy inauspicious suit  " Hence must we date our nuptials this a time  " To ask a blessing in this awful moment  " For mourning for misfortune only fit  " Can this be happy when a father dies  Tim  " No more give me your hands come on each side  " The overshadowing heavens shower down upon you  " Infinite blessings make you one in heart  " In mind faith truth contentment shun mankind  " Live to yourselves and to the Gods alone  Evan  " Break break my heart  Tim  " Weep not for me my child death is my cure  " Life my disease Son daughter friend farewell  " Bring not my corps within the walls of  Athens  " But lay me on the very hem of the sea  " Where the vast  Neptune  may for ever weep  " On my low graveRememberOh 'tis past  Dies  Evan  " There fled his spirit waft it immortal gods  " Up to our heavenly mansions yes my father  " We will entomb thee by the ocean's edge  " On the salt beech and when the thronging waves  " Which every morn shall bow their curled heads  " To kiss thy tomb shall like the flattering friends  " Of this base world fall off and leave thee bare  " Then will I come down to the vacant strand  " Washing thy grave with never ceasing tears  " Till the sea flows again  Alcib  " Ah turn  Evanthe  " Turn from that mournful sight and look upon me  " Damp not the blessing which his dying breath  " Pronounc'd upon us and lament not him  " Who freed from this bad world rests from his cares  " Now let us bear him to the neighbouring beach  " And with such rites as soldiers use inter him  " Under the vaulted cliff such was his will  " Strong in extreams from love to hatred tost  In the fierce conflict he was whelm'd and lost"  FINIS
