 THE ADVANCEMENT AND REFORMATION OF Modern POETRY  A Critical Discourse In Two Parts  The First Shewing that the Principal Reason why the Ancients excel'd the Moderns in the greater Poetry was because they mix'd Religion with Poetry  The Second Proving that by joyning Poetry with the Religion reveal'd to us in Sacred Writ the Modern Poets might come to equal the Ancient  Ab Jove principium Musae  Virg  Per Ambages Deorum{que} Ministeria praecipitandus est liber Spiritus  Petron  By Mr  DENNIS  LONDON  Printed for  Rich Parker  at the  Unicorn  under the Piazza of the  Royal Exchange  in  Cornhil  M DCCI  To the Most Noble JOHN Lord Marquess of  Normanby  Earl of  Mulgrave  c AND Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter  My Lord  I Make no question but that all those Gentlemen who shall happen to be offended at the Newness and Boldness of the Positions which are the subject of the following Treatise will accuse me of want of Judgment not only for advancing 'em but for daring to bring 'em under the protection of so discerning a Judge as your Lordship  But I desire those Gentlemen to believe that if I had had a mind that my faults should have lain conceal'd or would have consulted my own more than the publick advantage your Lordship is the person to whom of all mankind I would last have chosen to have address'd them That tho you had never writ your admirable Essay I should have been convinc'd by your other Poems and particularly by your  Temple of Death  a Temple that is consecrated at the same time to Death and to Immortality of your perfect knowledge in Criticism because I have experience enough to be satisfied that there never was a great Poet in the world who was not an accomplish'd Critick  Horace  who was one of the greatest of the  Roman  Poets was in the first Rank of Judges and  Virgil  has taken care to transmit to posterity one of the exactest pieces of Criticism that ever was writ in the world tho indeed it is a Criticism by Examples only of which  Bossu  vouchsaf'd to write the Rules above sixteen hundred years afterwards  Thus my Lord I am sufficiently acquainted with your Character to approach you with awe but at the same time I am convinc'd that they are mistaken who believe that the most Discerning are the most  Rigid Judges I am satisfied that a Write has a great deal of reason to be more apprehensive of half Criticks who are govern'd by opinion or guided by prejudice or sway'd by partial affection and who see faults but in some places and at some particular times for such Censors are inexorable to the least of our Errors But your Lordship whose unclouded Understanding sees all our faults whereever they are and who knows how difficult if not impossible it is for us not to err will make large allowances for the Imperfections of Humane Nature or our particular frailties if you discover in us the appearance of any good quality which may bespeak your indulgence Imperfect partial prejudic'd Criticks have Judgment enough to Discover Faults but want Discernment to find out Beauties or if at any time by chance they Discover them they are perhaps too interested or too envious or too fearful to own them But as Nature that has given you so many extraordinary qualities has conspir'd with Fortune in setting your Lordship infinitely above so mean a Passion as Envy so she has plac'd you as far above the Imperious sway of opinion that madly tyrannizes over the multitude Your Lordship never approves of our actions because  they have met with success but because they deserve to succeed And here I humbly desire of your Lordship that in behalf of all the Lovers of Poetry I may return you thanks for the Protection and Patronage of a great man deceas'd 'Tis known to all the observing world that you generously began to espouse him when he was more than half opprest by a very formidable party in the Court of King  Charles II  a faction that wanted neither Power nor Authority to crush him who besides that they held the foremost Rank in the State had got possession of the minds of the people with whom they had acquir'd a great Reputation for their Knowledge and Capacity in matters of Wit and Criticism If that great man had faults your Lordship wanted no Discernment to find them but you wanted malice partiality prejudice and the rest of those ungenerous obstacles that hindred others from discovering or confessing his Beauties Your Lordship easily found that he had Beauties which overweigh'd all faults and it was that consideration that engag'd you to support him against his powerful adversaries They upon an unaccountable  which they had taken to his person  have opprest his growing merit  consideration of that  cherish'd his person notwithstanding  his pretended frailties and while others to express their malice to the man would have hindred the advancement even of that Art which they pretended to esteem so much your Lordship on the contrary by a wise a good natur'd and a noble proceeding cherish'd the man on purpose to make him instrumental in advancing the Art And as it was after you took him into your protection that he writ several of his most valuable pieces 'tis to your Lordship that the world is in some measure indebted for the greater number of his excellencies  And with the same greatness of mind with which to advance a noble Art you rais'd and supported a man oppress'd by very powerful adversaries so in order to the same design you pull'd down the Tyranny of publick prejudice and of a Triumphant opinion For 'tis known to all the world that your Lordship declar'd against the Obscenity which was shamefully crept into our  English  Poetry at a time when not only that way of writing but the Verses which you particularly hinted at were in the very height of their Reputation But the success was answerable to the nobleness of your Lordships attempt those Verses have gradually declin'd ever since in their  Reputation and nothing of that nature will now be suffer'd by any but the Rabble So that your Lordship has done a very signal kindness not only to a noble Art but to Vertue itself and have highly oblig'd all vertuous men as well as lovers of Poetry  My Lord I have mentioned this the more willingly because it fairly gives me an opportunity of confirming by your Lordships Authority the assertion which is the foundation of the following Treatise which is that Religion gives a very great advantage for the exciting of Passion in Poetry Your Lordship has inform'd us that Obscenity and Poetry are things that are inconsistent The assertion must be granted by all to be unquestionably true for nothing can be possibly consistent with an Art which runs counter to the very end and design of that Art Now the end of Poetry is to Instruct and Reform and Obscenity in writing corrupts the manners But this on the other side is not to be doubted that Verses may be produc'd from the ancient Poets which are at once Obscene and Poetical tho at the same time it must be confest that they would have been more fine if they had been more chaste But if any one demands why Ribaldry should be  in the Ancient Poetry when  it is so plainly insufferable in the Modern to him I answer that it can be nothing but the Religion of the Ancients which makes the difference for theirs was very consistent with Obscenity whereas ours entirely abhors it A way of writing that was authoriz'd by their Religion could never be said to be utterly inconsistent with instruction Besides Passion is the principal thing in Poetry and tho Obscenity has something too gross and fulsom in it to consist with the Delicacy of a tender Passion yet by mingling with their Obscene Verses their  Cupid  their  Venus  and the rest of their Amorous Divinities they had the advantage of that other sort of Passion which we call Enthusiasm whereas the Divinity of our Religion being utterly abhorrent of any thing which is impure such Ribaldry inserted in our Poetry can never possibly either instruct or move  The consideration of what your Lordship has done to advance Poetry has oblig'd me to lay the following Treatise at your feet a Present I confess that is altogether unworthy of you but it is by much the most valuable that either I have or ever have had to make and your Lordship has accepted it with the same goodness that the  Persian  King did the Apple He saw that  it was all that his Subject could do to testifie his acknowledgment and for that very reason it was more agreeable to him than the vain pompous Presents of those who believ'd they could add to his Treasure I believ'd that the very Design to improve an Art which your Lordship has actually so much advanc'd would prevail upon your goodness to excuse a great many faults which you may find in the following Treatise  But upon mentioning the Design of the ensuing Discourse I find my self sufficiently perplex'd There are several things of the last importance that ought to be preliminary to the Discourse itself And I find that I have strong temptations upon me of following Mr  Dryden  's Example and of saying to your Lordship what is usually directed to the Reader in general But then I consider that I have neither Mr  Dryden's  great qualities nor like him a Reputation long establish'd nor what ought chiefly to be consider'd the Honour of having often approach'd your Lordship to authorize such a Liberty But yet on the other side the things that I have to say are of important consequence to the good of the Cause which I have undertaken and I find that I should be  ting to that noble Cause if I should address my self to the Reader in general and  I should be thought by all discerning persons to proceed as absurdly as would a Lawyer who upon a solemn pleading should apply himself to the Multitude who have little knowledge of his affair and no Authority to determine it instead of speaking to his Awful Judge who has a perfect knowledge of his Cause and a Soveraign Authority to decide it  The Design of all Poetical Criticism must be if it is just and good to advance so useful and so noble an Art as Poetry And the design of the following Treatise is no less than to set the Moderns upon an equal foot with even admir'd Antiquity In order to the doing which I humbly desire leave of your Lordship that I may make an enquiry in what the preheminence of the Ancient Poets consists and why I prefer one of the  Grecian  Tragedies as for example the  Oedipus  of  Sophocles  to one of our celebrated  English  Tragedies as for instance the  Julius Caesar  of  Shakespear  Upon reflection I find that the reason is because I am more delighted and more instructed by the former and that for this very reason because I am more mov'd by it For I find by experience that I am no further pleas'd nor instructed by any Tragedy than as it excites Passion in me But in  order to the discovering why I am more mov'd by the former than the latter of those Tragedies I desire leave to make an enquiry into the principal differences between them and that in all probability will determine the matter I find then my Lord that there are two very signal differences between the  Oedipus  and the  Julius Caesar  First the  Oedipus  is exactly Just and Regular and the  Julius Caesar  is very Extravagant and Irregular Secondly the  Oedipus  is very Religious and the  Julius Caesar  is Irreligious For with submission to your Lordships Judgment I conceive that every Tragedy ought to be a very solemn Lecture inclucating a particular Providence and showing it plainly protecting the good and chastizing the bad or at least the violent and that if it is otherwise it is either an empty amusement or a scandalous and pernicious Libel upon the government of the world The killing of  Julius Caesar  in  Shakespear  is either a Murder or a Lawful Action if the killing  Caesar  is a Lawful Action then the killing of  Brutus  and  Cassius  is downright Murder and the Poet has been guilty of polluting the Seene with the blood of the very best and last of the  Romans  But if the killing of  Caesar  is Murder and  Brutus  and  Cassius  are very justly punish'd for it then  Shakespear  is on the other side answerable for introducing so many Noble  Romans  committing in the open face of an Audience a very horrible Murder and only punishing two of them which proceeding gives an occasion to the people to draw a dangerous inference from it which may be Destructive to Government and to Human Society  Thus My Lord I have a great deal of reason to suspect that the  Oedipus  derives its advantage from its Regularity and its Religion and the presumption grows still more strong when upon enquiry I find that the foremention'd Regularity is nothing but the bringing some Rules into practice which Observation and Philosophy have found requisite for the surer exciting of Passion For as this I think cannot be contested that of two Combatants who have equal Strength and equal Courage he is most likely to have the better who has the most address so in a contention and prize of Poetry between persons who have equal force of mind he will be certain to have the advantage who is the best instructed to use his strength  If any of the enemies to Regularity will give themselves the trouble to peruse the  Oedipus  of  Sophocles  with an impartial  eye he will easily discern how instrumental the Poetical Art is in leading him from Surprize to Surprize from Compassion to Terror and from Terror to Compassion again without giving him so much as a time to breathe and he will as easily discover how the Religion that is every where intermix'd with the Play shews all the Surprizes even when he least expects this as so many immediate successive effects of a particular Dreadful Providence which make them come like so many Thunderclaps from a serene Heaven to confound and astonish him  A Poet is capacitated by that which is commonly call'd Regularity to excite the ordinary Passions more powerfully by the constitution of the Fable and the influence which that must necessarily have both upon the words and thoughts and Religion▪ besides the Influence it will have upon the ordinary Passions will be to a Poet who has force and skill enough to make his advantage of it a perpetual source of extraordinary Passion which is commonly call'd Enthusiasm for the sentiments and the expressions  For what concerns Regularity or the exciting of ordinary Passion enough has been said already Your Lordship has particularly made the Publick a Present which is I confess but little in Volume but is magnificent  in Value and Ornament 'tis a Present in Jewels which casts a further lustre than Treasures that take up a larger space and is more solid to those who are near it Our Writers have been sufficiently told that writing Regularly is writing Morally Decently Justly Naturally Reasonably The Design my Lord of the following Treatise is to shew of what use Religion may be to the advancement of Poetry But because all that has been said concerning Regularity is so necessary a preparative to this Design that it would be wholly useless without it I hope your Lordship will not think it to be foreign to my purpose if at a time when the Rules are neglected by some and slighted by others I bestow a little time in proving the necessity of observing those without the strict observance of which the following Treatise will be an empty amusement and we must absolutely despair of making any advancement in Poetry  The necessity of observing Rules to the attaining a perfection in Poetry is so very apparent that he who will give himself the trouble of Reflecting cannot easily doubt of it Rules are necessary even in all the inferiour Arts as in Painting and Musick If any one should pretend to draw a Picture without having ever been taught or without knowing or  practising any thing of Perspective or Proportion but should pretend to succeed alone by the natural force of his Fancy that man would certainly be esteem'd a very Impudent and Impertinent person  Your Lordship knows that it is the very same thing in Musick that it is in Painting If any one should pretend to compose in parts without understanding the grounds that person would infallibly render himself very contemptible Now if they please by Rules in a less noble Art can they reasonably expect to please without them in one that is more noble If they please not by Rules in Poetry how must they please By Chance For this is certain that they must do it by one or the other for there is no third way  There is nothing in Nature that is great and beautiful without Rule and Order and the more Rule and Order and Harmony we find in the objects that strike our sences the more worthy and noble we esteem them I humbly conceive that it is the same in Art and particularly in Poetry which ought to be an exact imitation of Nature Now Nature taken in a stricter sense is nothing but that Rule and Order and Harmony which we find in the visible Creation The Universe owes its admirable beauty to  the Proportion Situation and Dependance of its parts And the little World which we call Man owes not only its Health and Ease and Pleasure nay the continuance of its very Being to the Regularity of Mechanical motion but even the strength too of its boasted Reason and the piercing force of those aspiring thoughts which are able to pass the bounds that circumscribe the Universe As Nature is Order and Rule and Harmony in the visible World so Reason is the very same throughout the invisible Creation For Reason is Order and the Result of Order And nothing that is Irregular as far as it is Irregular ever was or ever can be either Natural or Reasonable Whatever God Created he designed it Regular and as the rest of the Creatures cannot swerve in the least from the Eternal Laws preordain'd for them without becoming fearful or odious to us so Man whose mind is a Law to itself can never in the least transgress that Law without lessning his Reason and debasing his Nature In fine whatever is Irregular either in the Visible or Invisible World is to the person who thinks right except in some very extraordinary cases either Hateful or Contemptible  both Nature and Reason which But a  two in a larger acceptation is Nature owe their Greatness their Beauty their Majesty to th eirperpetualOrder for Order at first made the face ofthings so beautiful and the cessation of that Order would once more bring in Chaos so Poetry which is an imitation of Nature must do the same thing I can neither have Greatness or Real Beauty if it swerves from the Laws which Reason severely prescribes it and the more Irregular any Poetical Composition is the nearer it comes to extravagance and confusion and to nonsence which is nothing  But as in some of the numberless parts which constitute this beauteous all there are some appearing irregularities which parts notwithstanding contribute with the rest to compleat the Harmony of universal Nature and as there are some seeming Irregularities even in the wonderful Dispensations of the Supream and Soveraign Reason as the oppression of the good and flourishing of the bad which yet at the bottom are rightly adjusted and wisely compensated and are purposely appointed by Divine Foreknowledge for the carrying on the profound Designs of Providence so if we may compare great things with small in the creation of the accomplish'd Poem some things may at first sight be seemingly against Reason  which yet at the bottom are perfectly Regular because they are indispensably necessary to the admirable conduct of a great and a just Design  No man knows better than your Lordship that the Renown'd Masters among the Ancients  Homer  and  Virgil    c  had too much Capacity and too much Discernment not to see the necessity of knowing and practising the Rules which Reason and Philosophy have prescib'd to Poets They wrote not with a little narrow Design to please a Tumultuous transitory assembly or a handful of men who were call'd their Countrymen They wrote to their fellow Citizens of the Universe to all Countries and to all Ages and they were perfectly convinc'd that tho Caprice and Extravagance may please the multitude who are always fluctuating and always uncertain yet that nothing but what is great in Reason and Nature could be able to delight and instruct Mankind They were clearly convinc'd that nothing could transmit their Immortal works to posterity but something like that harmonious Order which maintains the Universe that it was partly to that they were to owe that wondrous merit which could be able to render their Fame eternal to extend and perpetuate the very languages in which they  writ and to illustrate the glory of their Countries by their own  Your Lordship knows that it was towards the beginning of the last Century that the  French  a subtle and discerning Nation began to be sensible of this and upon it several of their extraordinary men both Poets and Philosophers began to cultivate Criticism Upon which there follow'd two very remarkable things For first the cultivating of the Poetical Art advanc'd their Genius's to such a height as was unknown to  France  before and secondly the appearing of those great Genius's was very instrumental in spreading their language thro all the Christian World and in raising the esteem of their Nation to that degree that it naturally prepar'd the way for their Intrigues of State and facilitated the execution of their vast Designs  My Lord these alterations happen'd in  France  while the  French  reform'd the structure of their Poems by the noble models of ancient Architects and your Lordship knows very well that the very contrary fell out among us while notwithstanding your generous attempt to reform us we resolv'd with an injudicious obstinacy to adhere to our  Gothick  and Barbarous manner For in the first place our Stage has degenerated  not only from the taste of Nature but from the greatness it had in the time of  Shakespear  in whose  Coriolanus  and  Cassius  we see something of the Invincible Spirit of the  Romans  but in most of our Heroes which have lately appear'd on the Stage Love has been still the predominant passion whether they have been  Grecian  or  Roman  Heroes which is false in Morality and of scandalous instruction and as false and absurd in Physicks For Ambition makes a man a Tyrant to himself as well as it does to others and where it once prevails enslaves the Reason and subdues all other Passions And it was for this very cause if your Lordship will allow me to make this digression that in the two Tragedies that I writ my self I made Love a subordinate Passion and subjected it in the one to Glory and in the other to Friendship that so I might make them fit to entertain the wisest of our Sex and the best and most virtuous of the other And it is impossible to tell you with what extream satisfaction I heard that the last of them was not displeasing to you  But secondly At the same time that the  French  has been growing almost an universal Language the  English  has been so far from diffusing itself in so vast a manner that I know by experience that a man may  travel o're most of these Western parts of  Europe  without meeting with three Foreigners who have any tolerable knowledge of it And yet the  English  is more strong more full more sounding more significant and more harmonious than the  French  I know very well that a great many will be unwilling to allow the last but I appeal to your Lordship if this is not a convincing proof of it that we have Blank Verse which is not inharmonious and the  French  pretend to no Poetical Numbers without the assistance of Rhime  But it may perhaps be alledg'd that the reason why the  French  has got the advantage of our language is partly from their situation on the Continent partly from the intrigues and affairs which they have with their Neighbours and partly because their Language has more affinity with one of the learned Languages But to this I answer that the  Germans  are as advantageously seated as the  French  for diffusing their Language and the  Spanish  Tongue is rather nearer related to the  Latin  than is the  French  and all the World knows that towards the beginning of the last Century the House of  Austria  was full as busie with their Neighbours as the House of  Bourbon  is now and yet then neither the  German  nor the  Spanish  Tongue made any conside+rable progress I will not deny but that the situation and affairs of the  French  may have been of advantage to them in the diffusing their Language but 'tis certainly the Learning of any Nation that is most instrumental in it I make no doubt but that in Learning which is useful and necessary and barely solid without ornament we far surpass the  French  Our practical Physicians have more Reputation than theirs even in  France  itself and our practical Divines have acquir'd more Fame throughout the Northern Countries of  Europe  than either the natives of those places or any of the Modern  French  Divines whether they are Reform'd or Papistical And this last is therefore the more considerable because they writ in our mother Tongue whereas the Physicians have employed a learned Language But I am very much inclin'd to believe that 'tis the polite Learning of any Nation that contributes most to the extending its Language and Poetry is the branch of polite Learning which is the most efficacious in it In order to the proving this I desire your Lordships leave to examine who they are who are most Instrumental in making a Language pass the bounds which confine the original speakers of it And  they seem to me to be the Gentlemen of neighbouring Nations who have time and opportunity to visit foreign Countries and are capacitated by their Fortunes and their Educations to cultivate Languages which they were not born to speak For besides that these are the persons who are the most capacitated to learn them they have by the variety and multiplicity of their conversation most opportunities to spread them Now the motives that for the most part incite Gentlemen to study are two Pleasure and Vanity But Pleasure and Vanity will find their account abundantly more in polite Learning than in Literature which is barely solid For polite Learning is more easie and has more of Imagination in it and instructs them much better how to varnish their defects and render them agreeable to one another 'Tis chiefly then the polite Learning of any Nation that engages the Gentlemen of foreign Countries to apply themselves to study the Language of that Nation But even of polite Learning Poetry appears to be the most agreeable and most attractive branch because it is the most moving And we find by experience that in the Learning of those Languages which have been most generally known Poetry has made a very considerable figure Gentlemen then in all  likelihood will apply themselves most eagerly to the study of that Language whose Poetry is very agreeable to them But that Poetry must be most agreeable to the generality of Gentlemen which is most moving and most instructive For tho Gentlemen study to please themselves yet if they are men of sense they will not be for empty pleasure but will endeavour to be instructed and delighted together Besides when Gentlemen begin to study the Poetry of any language the first thing they understand is the reasonable part of it For the fineness of the Imaginative part which depends in great measure upon force of words and upon the beauty of expression must lye conceal'd from them in a good degree till they are perfect in the Language Thus the Poetry of that Language which is most reasonable and most instructive must in all likelihood have most attraction for the Gentlemen of neighbouring Nations and we have shewn above that that is the most reasonable and most instructive Poetry which is the most Regular  My Lord upon this foot it is easie to determine whether our Poetry or the  French  has most attractions for the rest of  Europe  This is plain that  Moliere    Corneille  and  Racine  and  Boileau  are known in a manner  to all the Christian World whereas  Spencer  and  Milton    Ben Johnson  and  Shakespear  are strangers as it were to all the world excepting the Subjects of  Great Britain  I believe that our Language by reason of the dependance that it has upon the  Saxon  is not very difficult to be learnt by the people of the Northern Countries and in short many of their Clergy have learnt enough of it to make their advantage of our Ecclesiastical Writings But both they and their Gentlemen are almost wholly strangers to our Poetry whereas the  French  Poets are extremely well known to the▪ But here some angry people will immediately ask if I affirm that our own is inferiour to the  French  Poetry To satisfie both them and the Truth I am oblig'd to declare at the same time submitting this matter to be decided by your Lordship in the last appeal that I believe we have naturally more force and more elevation than the  French  that several things in  Shakespear  are superiour to any which the  French  Theatre has produc'd and that in some little Poems which either requir'd no symetry or were writ by those who very well knew how to practise it we are absolutely superiour to them that at last I am not so much delivering my own thoughts as the opinions  of others that the very design I have even in affirming what I do is to do what lies in my little capacity to put our Writers in a way to make our Neighbours and with them all  Europe  sensible of the advantage which we have by Nature that even our natural force must receive accession from Art and augment in proportion as the  French  has done that both our Force and our Spirit will in all likelihood be augmented by Skill as address in the use of our Weapons very often adds both to our Force and Courage That a Poem with a Fable is like a Human Body and that the weakness of any one part influences and disables in some degree those which in themselves are strong that if we are not shock'd at our own Irregularity 'tis because it has the advantage of long Habitude for we have been us'd to it from our Infancy but that to our Neighbours who have constantly been us'd to Art and Conduct it must seem as awkward and as disagreeable as our  Gothick  Cathedrals would to those  Italians  who have always frequented St  Peter  's and that what I barely call Irregular here would be term'd by them Indecent Immoral Unjust Unreasonable Unnatural In fine I appeal to your Lordship whether the  French  Dramatick Writers are not believ'd superiour to  the  English  by all the rest of  Europe  th  at the same time I am convinc'd that our Writers having naturally more elevation and our Language more Harmony than theirs and both our Writers and Language more force we want only Art to make ourselves as superiour to them in Poetry as we formerly were in Empire  And here my Lord I fancy that I  the enemies to Regularity in a little confu…sion they are too well satisfied of you  Lordships Ability and Impartiality to de…cline your Jurisdiction and they cann  but remember to their sorrow that you hav  formerly given the Cause against them  Upon supposition then that for the futu  they will instruct themselves in the Poetic  Art I must leave it to your Lordship  determine whether the following Treat  may be of any service to them and gi  them still another advantage over  French  by directing them to choose  to manage their subjects in such a manne  as may make them most susceptible of Po  …try and that is to find or make the  Religious a piece of Criticism which  I knew not how escap'd all the  French  Cri+ticks  Your Lordship knows very well that so  of them as for instance  Boileau  di+cerning  the actual preheminence of the Ancients have fondly believ'd that they were superiour to us by Nature and that others as  Perrault  very justly disdaining to own such a natural superiority have very unjustly deny'd their actual preheminence The first part of the following Treatise was intended to shew that the Ancient Poets had  at actual preheminence but that they deriv'd it from joyning their Religion with their Poetry upon which I believe they were thrown at first by chance The Design of the second part is to shew that the Moderns by incorporating Poetry with the Religion reveal'd to us in Sacred Writ may come to equal the Ancients But two things must be always suppos'd the one That the Poets have force and skill equal to the subjects they treat of and a sacred subject requires ten times more of both than a prophane one The other is That this is not to be extended to those sorts of Poetry in which the Moderns cannot possibly make use of their Religion with the same advantage that the  Grecians  and  Romans  employ'd theirs as Epic Pastoral and Amorous Poetry  My Lord The ultimate end of the ensuing discourse is to shew that the intention of Poetry and the Christian Religion being  ike to move the affections they may very  well be made instrumental to the advancing each other I have reason to believe th  this Design will not be unacceptable to you  Lordship not only upon the account of Re…ligion it self but as you are an Encourage  of Arts and a great Statesman who know that the bare endeavour to advance an A  among us is an effort to augment the Learning and consequently the Reputation▪ and consequently the Power of a gre  people that the flourishing of the establish'd Religion must have a necessary influenc  upon the publick Prosperity that he wh  does any thing to recommend Christianity to the minds of others endeavours to promote the common good as on the other side He who breaks in upon the Revelation makes a dangerous attempt not only upon the Constitution but upon Government in general that there never was nor ever can be any flourishing Government without a Reveal'd Religion that several  Englishmen  have lost together with the Religion of their Ancestors their Honour their Integrity and their Publick Spirit and that open and avowed Deism has grown up among us together with Abominable Corruptions not only in the manners of private men but in the the administration of publick affairs  But now my Lord I have been so intent upon my Cause that it has almost made me forget that for my having detain'd you so long I ought to beg pardon not only of your Lordship but of your Friends and the Publick That by writing this I am guilty of diverting you from writing or speaking your self something which is much more Important either at Home or in that Illustrious Assembly of which you are so solid and shining an Ornament I humbly desire of your Lordship to excuse the Liberty I have taken and to believe that I am with the profoundest Respect  My Lord  Your Lordship's most Oblig'd Most Humble and Most Obedient Servant  John Dennis  THE ADVANCEMENT AND REFORMATION OF Modern Poetry  PART I  CHAP I The Design of the Work  NOthing can shew the excellence of Poetry more than that it has always been esteem'd by the best of men and that there has been no extraordinary man in  the world since it came to any perfection but who has commended it or encourag'd it  And yet to the Confusion of most who have given themselves time to think of it Poetry that has been encourag'd by so many great Princes is believ'd by several to have degenerated rather than to have improv'd by Time while Physicks Metaphysicks and some other Arts that have been very little or not at all encourag'd have advanc'd considerably  And what will appear to be yet more strange the very efforts that the Moderns have made to advance Poetry have done it hurt because they have proceeded upon such erroneous principles as have not only made their attempts successless but have caus'd them to mistake their Errors for their Impotence  For some of the Moderns who have been great Admirers of their Contemporaries which is a modest expression for themselves will by no means allow that the Ancients have excell'd us From which opinion Presumption has follow'd and from Presumption Security and from Security Idleness  But Despair on the other side has done a great deal more harm than Presumption has done on that For some who have been of opinion that the Ancients have surpass'd us have believ'd that they have done so because they were in themselves superiour to us from which it has happen'd that they have been servilely contented with following their old Masters and most of the Best of the Modern Poetry has been but a Copy of the Ancient  These different Opinions have occasion'd Disputes and these Disputes have produc'd Quarrels which have been maintain'd with a great deal of Heat on both sides The favourers of the Moderns have treated their Adversaries as dejected littlesoul'd persons who have a base opinion of themselves and of Human Nature which last they have much ado to forgive them because they are included in the Censure  For How can it be say they but a Scandalous Despondence that obliges us to prefer other men to our selves when Reason gives us the preference For this they say is past all Dispute that they who excel others in the same kinds  of Writing must have some advantage over them And that advantage must be either from without or from within or from the subjects they treat of Now we can make it appear say the Favourers of the Moderns that the Ancient Poets had no external or internal advantage over us and that the advantage of the subject is rather on our side And this is what the Favourers of the Moderns alledge for themselves The Partizans of the Ancients have on the other side treated the Favourers of the Moderns as persons that are absolutely ignorant and without taste  That the Ancients have excelled us in the greatness of Poetry they pretend to prove from the Authority of all who have universally been acknowledged to to be the best Judges For say they the consent of these where the question is concerning a thing that is rather to be felt than to be demonstrated is of the last importance We defy say they any of the Favourers of the Moderns to name so much as one Modern Critick who has any Reputation in the world who does not acknowledge that the Ancients surpass us in the greatness of Poetry  For the few say they who have asserted the preheminence of the Moderns have immediately rendred themselves ridiculous to all men who have any understanding in these affairs and at length to all the rest excepting a little handful of men whose arrogance and obstinacy and extravagant vanity has been a Comedy to the rest  So that the consent of the best Criticks continue they implies the consent of all and the consent of mankind for so many several ages concerning a thing that is rather to be felt than to be demonstrated is if not a convincing Proof at least a very strong Presumption But what has been the event of this Dispute on both sides Why the probability of the Arguments instead of working conviction has only exasperated the Spirits of the Parties and the Favourers of the Moderns have treated the Lovers of the Ancients as so many slavish Pedants and these on the other side the Favourers of the Moderns as so many ignorant Fools  Amidst this diversity of opinions and these contentious ferments I thought I should do an important service to a most  noble art if I could contribute any thing to the reconciling the common Friends to Poetry that they might endeavour the advancement of the common cause with greater force united  In order then to the calming the Fury of the Contending Parties I shall endeavour to extort Important Concessions from both and oblige on the one side the Favourers of the Moderns to acknowledge that the Ancients are not so weak as to make the Moderns presume and engage at the same time the Partisans of the Ancients to own that the Ancients are not in themselves so strong as to make the Moderns despair  And in order to the gaining this point with the greater ease and the making my self an Agreeable Mediator of Peace I shall endeavour to make an Impartial enquiry into the merits of the Cause and try to engage both Parties by turns by supporting their just pretensions And whereas the Favourers of the Moderns have justly alledged that all Writers who surpass others in the same kinds of Writings must do it from some nternal or external advantage or from  the subject it self I shall endeavour to shew in the two following Chapters that the Ancients could not derive their preheminence from any external or internal advantage and afterwards we shall proceed to examine whether they deriv'd it from the subjects they treated of  CHAP II That the Ancients did not excel the Moderns by any External Advantage  THe External Advantages which one Writer has over another are chiefly two The Assistance which he receives from the Age in which he writes and the Encouragement he meets with Now we shall shew that the Ancients did not surpass the Moderns on the account of either of these  First they had no advantage in the Assistance which they receiv'd from the Age in which they writ on the contrary  the advantage here is clearly on the side of the Moderns For good Thinking is the foundation of good Writing both in Eloquence and in Poetry Now thoughts are but the Images of things and our knowledge of things is greater than that of the Ancients For several which they knew are better known to us and we know several which they never knew at all How many Arts have the Moderns improv'd How many wonderful Inventions are owing to them And how many amazing Discoveries From which we have a supply of Thoughts and Images that is never to be exhausted So that in the Assistance which we Receive from the Age in which we live we have the advantage of the Ancients  Nor secondly is it from the encouragement which they received that the Ancient Poets excell'd the Moderns Tho at the same time I really believe that Encouragement was one of the causes of the Ancient excellence of the Orators For tho good Thinking is the foundation of good Writing both in Eloquence and in Poetry and the Moderns are qualify'd  to think as Reasonably and as Subtly as the Ancients thought yet 'tis in these Arts as it is in Architecture there can be no Beauty nor Greatness without Foundation but 'tis not the Foundation that makes the Greatness or Beauty The chief design of Eloquence is to perswade and he perswading the most effectually who moves his Hearers the most that which makes the Greatness and Beauty of Eloquence is not so much the thinking rightly tho without that there can be no Excellence as those violent Passions that reign and tyrannize over our Souls in the Speeches of the Ancient Orators which they chiefly deriv'd from Ambition For the moving their Popular Assemblies among the Ancient  Grecians  and  Romans  being almost the only way among them to arrive at the chief Honours of the State it can be no wonder to those who reflect upon the Force of Ambition and the Stings it infixes into the minds of men that the Ancient  Grecians  and  Romans  should be so great Masters of Eloquence For being instigated and stung by Ambition they not only were supported in the taking such pains as the  Moderns are utterly uncapable of taking because they have not the same incentive to sustain them but being mov'd and fir'd by Ambition themselves they the more easily rowz'd and inflam'd others for if any one happens to urge that the Love of Glory being alike inseparable from Moderns and Ancients they have equal incentives to Eloquence I desire him to take notice that there is a very considerable difference between the Love of Glory barely considered and that which is joyn'd to Ambition which is the desire of Power and Place For I desire him to consider what Nourishment and Force the Love of Glory that was in the minds of the Ancient Orators must necessarily have received from the Tumultuous applauses of the popular Assemblies and the Glorious Recompences that ensued upon them  But now if any one thinks that he has here found out the Reason why the Ancients surpass'd us in the greater Poetry because Passion making the Greatness and Beauty of Poetry as well as it does of Eloquence which it certainly does as shall be clearly shewn  anon and Passion receiving access from Encouragement the Ancient Poets writ with a Force superiour to that of the Moderns only because they were more encouraged if any one I say thinks at this rate he will find himself very much mistaken For tho I am convinc'd that Encouragement does very much yet I am satisfied that the difference is not chiefly owing to that for in the first place tho the encouragement which the Ancients gave was more general than that which the Moderns have met with yet some of the Moderns have been as much encourag'd as most of the Ancients were and yet fall very much short of them in the greater Poetry of which  Boileau  and  Racine  are two Illustrious Examples In the second place  Homer  the most admirable of all the Ancients was not at all encourag'd In the third place one of the Moderns receiv'd no encouragement who has often transcendently soar'd above both Ancients and Moderns and that is  Milton  as shall be shewn in its proper place And lastly Comedy was as much encourag'd by the  Grecians  and  Romans  as any other  sort of Poetry witness what the  Athenians  did for  Aristophanes  and  Scipio  and  Lelius  for  Terence  and yet I am perswaded that the Moderns have surpass'd the Ancients in Comedy and shall give my Reasons below why I make no scruple of preferring  Moliere  and two or three of our own Comick Poets to  Terence  and  Aristophanes  So that we must seek for another Cause of the excellence of the Ancient Poets than the encouragement they met with  There are three other things which may be numbred among external advantages and those are the Climates in which the Ancient Poets liv'd and the Languages in which they writ and the Liberty which they enjoy'd But these are not the chief things from which the Ancients deriv'd their Preheminence For the greatest of the  Lyrick  Poets writ in a Country of downright Blockheads and one of the greatest of the  Epick  Poets in a Country that had lost its Liberty and besides the  Grecians  enjoy'd all the advantages of their Climate and their Language and their Liberty long after the Decay of Poetry 'Tis true indeed the  Grecians  and  Romans  did  derive one real Excellence from the Beauty of their Language and that was the Harmony of their Versification in which the Moderns are not likely to equal them But Harmony of Versification is not the chief thing in Poetry nor does the chief Excellence of the Ancients consist in such a Harmony And thus we have shewn that they did not derive their Preheminence from any thing that was external Let us examine in the next Chapter whether the Ancients deriv'd their Excellence from any internal advantage  CHAP III That the Ancients did not surpass the Moderns from any Internal Advantage  THere is nothing more certain than that he who handles any subject excellently must do it by the power of his Internal Faculties And consequently he who treats any subject admirably  has an inward advantage over him who treats it scurvily But either that advantage is naturally deriv'd from the subject or it is not If it is naturally deriv'd from the subject in that case we can never pretend to deny that the Ancients had an inward advantage over the Moderns All that we shall endeavour to prove is that they had no internal advantage over them abstracted from the nature of the subjects of which they treated  Now all the internal advantages which the Ancients may be supposed to have had over the Moderns may be reduc'd to four Divine Inspiration Inspiration by Daemons A Natural Superiority of the Faculties of the Soul A greater Degree of Vertue  The first advantage that the Ancient Poets may be suppos'd to have had over the Moderns is from Divine Inspiration Now the Ancient Poets were the Heathen Theologues and to affirm that the Spirit of God should inspire those to teach the Adoration of Idols and inspire them more than he does the Moderns who are of the true Religion would be equally absurd and blasphemous  Nor Secondly can they have any advantage by Inspiration of Daemons For in the first place 'tis absurd to give a supernatural Cause of an effect of which we can give a very natural one But we can give a very natural Cause of the Excellence of the Ancient Poets as shall be shewn anon In the second place the Ancients before  Socrates  ow'd all their Moral Philosophy to their Poets Now tho that Philosophy was only dispers'd up and down in sentences yet had it a natural tendency to the forming that system which afterwards the Disciples of  Socrates  fram'd from the mouth of their Master And as that system was the utter overthrow of the Heathen Revelation as we shall shew anon any thing that had a natural tendency to the forming that system could not be the work of Daemons But Thirdly supposing the Ancient  Graecian  Poets were really inspired by Daemons it is hard to imagine that they should receive a greater advantage from such an Inspiration as that than the Moderns who apply themselves to Sacred Poetry should have from Divine Assistance  Nor Thirdly Can the Ancient Po+ets be suppos'd to have had a greater share of virtue than the Moderns For all the  Grecian  Poets who were famous for the greater Poetry flourish'd before there was in that part of the world any system of Morality And perhaps most of the  Roman  Poetry is only a Copy of the  Grecian  Now it is hard to imagin that they who had no system of Morality and no supernatural support should transcend the Moderns in Vertue who have a perfect system of Morality and Divine Assistance  Nor Fourthly and principally had the Ancient any natural superiority of Faculties over the Modern Poets For if they surpass the Moderns in the greater Poetry out of any superiority of Faculties which they had naturally as they were the Ancients it must be by a superiority of understanding or imagination or both But first it was not from any superiority of understanding Because from hence it would follow that the Minds of men grow weaker by succession of ages and then the Ancients would have surpass'd one another as they preceded in time  Orpheus  and  Musaeus  would have excell'd  Homer    Alcaeus  and  Stetichorus Pindar    Thespis Euripides  and  Aeschylus Sophocles    Tyrtaeus Virgil  and  Alcmon Horace  which is all absolutely false But then again if any one urges that if the Ancients did not surpass one another according to precedence of time it was because art and experience were requir'd to the perfection of Poetry and the younger in Time had the Advantage of the elder both in Art and Experience to that I answer that some of the Poets who are younger in Time have perhaps the advantage of those who are older more by Nature than they have by Art For the Tragick and Lyrick Poets who preceded  Sophocles  and  Pindar  come more behind them in true Genius than they go before them in Time But now if the Ancients did not surpass one another according to priority of Time why should they excel us If it be objected that several very extraordinary men happen'd to be born at such and such particular times to that I answer that this arriv'd by providence or by chance If you alledge that it fell out by chance to that  I reply that all the great Poets among the  Grecians  flourish'd within four hundred years of one another and all the great Poets among the  Romans  within two hundred years and then let me ask you whither this look'd like chance But if you pretend that these men at these particular times were design'd such excellent Poets by Providence and for that very end were form'd with faculties so much superiour to those who preceded them and who came after them then let me ask you for what design Providence should so manifestly alter the course of nature or why that which fell out by Providence then may not by Providence arrive again  Besides if the Ancient Poets excell'd the Moderns by a superiority of understanding it would necessarily follow that they understood their Subjects better which is false For the Subjects of the Epick Tragick and Lyrick Poets are the vertues vices and passions of men which the Moderns ought to understand at least as well as the Ancients because they have all the knowledge of the Ancients and their own improvement besides  Thus have I endeavour'd to show that we have no reason to despair of equalling the Ancients because of the Transcendency of their understandings And what has been said about their understandings may serve to shew that they as little excell'd the Moderns in their Imaginations as they did in the other tho something more may be said for the last for the violence of the Passions proceeding from the force of the Imagination and the corruption of Mankind from the violence of the Passions and the corruption of Mankind growing greater as the World grows older it follows that the Imaginations of Men must grow stronger as the World grows older  But lastly how vain it is to urge that the Ancients excell'd the Moderns by a superiority of Faculties when it will appear a little lower as clear as the Sun that one of the Moderns very often excells them both in his Thoughts and Spirit  Thus we have endeavour'd to shew that the Ancients did not excell the Moderns in the greater Poetry from any external advantage that is from the  assistance which they had from the Ages in which they writ or from the Encouragement with which they met We have shewn too that they did not surpass them from any Internal advantage whether it was from Divine Inspiration or Inspiration by Daemons or Transcendency of Vertue or superiority of Faculties The advantage then which the Ancient Poets had over the Moderns if they had any advantage must be deriv'd from the Subjects of which they treated  CHAP IV That the Ancient Poets deriv'd their greatness from the Nature of their Subjects  IF the Ancient Poets excell'd the Moderns in the greatness of Poetry that is in Epick Poetry in Tragedy and in the greater Ode they must necessarily derive their preheminence from the Subjects of which they treated since it has  beeu plainly made to appear that they could notDerive it from anyExternal or Internal advantage And it follows that the Subjects which were handled by the Ancients must be different from those which have been treated of by the Moderns And if the Poems which have been writ by the Ancients of the forementioned kinds were very much greater than those which have been produced by the Moderns why then it follows that the subjects were very different But here the Favourers of the Moderns assert that the advantage which is to be drawn from the Subject is purely on the side of the Moderns For who for Example will compare the atchievements of  Achilles  and  Aeneas  the event of which was only the reducing two pitiful paltry Bourgs with the glorious actions of some of our Modern Captains But then the Partizans of the Ancients reply that there is a difference between one subject and another which their adversaries seem not to have thought of For say they humane Subjects can never differ so much among themselves as Sacred Subjects differ from Humane for the difference  between the Two last is as great as that between God and Man which we know is infinite Now say they sacred Subjects are infinitely more susceptible of the greatness of Poetry than prophane ones can be And the Subjects of the Ancients in the forementioned Poems were sacred Now that we may engage the Lovers of the Antients in their turns by supporting their just pretensions let us endeavour to show in the following Chapters that Sacred Poems must be greater than Prophane ones can be supposing equality of Genius and equal art in the Writers and that the Poems of the Ancients in the forementioned kinds were sacred But in order to the doing that we must declare what Poety is and what is its chief Excellence  CHAP V The Passion is the chief thing in in Poetry and that all Passion is either ordinary Passion or Enthusiasm  But before we proceed let us define Poetry which is the first time that a Definition has been given of that noble Art For neither Ancient nor Modern Criticks have defin'd Poetry in general  Poetry then is an imitation of Nature by a pathetick and numerous Speech Let us explain it  As Poetry is an Art it must be an Imitation of Nature That the instrument with which it makes its Imitation is Speech need not be disputed That that Speech must be Musical no one can doubt For Numbers distinguish the parts of Poetick Diction from the periods of Prose Now Numbers are nothing but articulate sounds and their  pauses measur'd by their proper proportions of time And the periods of Prosaick Diction are articulate sounds and their pauses unmeasur'd by such proportions That the Speech by which Poetry makes its Imitation must be pathetick is evident for Passion is still more necessary to it than Harmony For Harmony only distinguishes its Instrument from that of Prose but Passion distinguishes its very nature and character For therefore Poetry is Poetry because it is more passionate and sensual than Prose A Discourse that is writ in very good Numbers if it wants Passion can be but measur'd Prose But a Discourse that is every where extremely pathetick and consequently every where bold and figurative is certainly Poetry without Numbers  Passion then is the Characteristical mark of Poetry and consequently must be every where For whereever a Discourse is not pathetick there it is Prosaick As Passion in a Poem must be every where so Harmony is usually diffus'd throughout it But Passion answers the two ends of Poetry better than Harmony can do and upon that account is  preferable to it For first it pleases more which is evident For Passion can please without Harmony but Harmony tires without Passion And in Tragedy and in Epick Poetry a man may instruct without Harmony but never without Passion For the one instructs by Admiration and the other by Compassion and Terror And as for the greater Ode if it wants Passion it becomes Hateful and Intolerable and its Sentences grow Contemptible  Passion is the Characteristical mark of Poetry and therefore it must be every where for without Passion there can be no Poetry no more than there can be Painting And tho the Poet and the Painter describe action they must describe it with Passion Let any one who beholds a piece of Painting where the Figures are shewn in action conclude that if the Figures are without Passion the Painting is contemptible There must be Passion every where in Poetry and Painting and the more Passion there is the better the Poetry and the Painting unless the Passion is too much for the subject and the Painter and the Poet arrive at the height of  their Art when they describe a great deal of Action with a great deal of Passion It is plain then from what has been said that Passion in Poetry must be every where for where there is no Passion there can be no Poetry but that which we commonly call Passion cannot be every where in any Poem There must be Passion then that must be distinct from ordinary Passion and that must be Enthusiasm I call that ordinary Passion whose cause is clearly comprehended by him who feels it whether it be Admiration Terror or Joy and I call the very same Passions Enthusiasms when their cause is not clearly comprehended by him who feels them And those Enthusiastick Passions are sometimes simple and sometimes complicated of all which we shall shew examples lower And thus I have shewn that the chief thing in Poetry is Passion but here the Reader is desir'd to observe that by Poetry we mean Poetry in general and the Body of Poetry for as for the form or soul of particular Poems that is allow'd by all to be a Fable But Passion is the chief thing in the Body of Poetry as Spirit is in the  Human Body For without Spirit the Body languishes and the Soul is impotent Now every thing that they call Spirit or Genius in Poetry in short every thing that pleases and consequently moves in the Poetick Diction is Passion whether it be ordinary or Enthusiastick  And thus we have shewn what the chief excellence in the Body of Poetry is which we have prov'd to be Passion Let us now proceed to the proofs of what we propounded that sacred subjects are more susceptible of Passion than prophane ones and that the subjects of the Ancients were sacred in their greater Poetry I mean either sacred in their own natures or by their manner of handling them  CHAP VI That Passion is more to be deriv'd from a Sacred Subject than from a Prophane one  WE have prov'd that Passion is the chief thing in Poetry and that Spirit or Genius and in short every thing that moves is Passion Now if the chief thing in Poetry be Passion why then the chief thing in great Poetry must be great Passion We have shewn too that Passion in Poetry is of two sorts ordinary Passion or Enthusiasm Let us now proceed to convince the Reader that a sacred Poem is more susceptible of Passion than a prophane one can be which to effect let us shew two things that a sacred subject is as susceptible of ordinary passions as a prophane one can be and more susceptible of the Enthusiastick  The first is evident from experience For the Poetry among the Ancients  which shall be hereafter prov'd to be sacred had in it greater ordinary Passions than their Human Poetry either had or could possibly have  'Tis now our business to show that Religious subjects are capable of supplying us with more frequent and stronger Enthusiasms than the prophane And in order to the clearing this let us enquire what Poetical Enthusiasm is Poetical Enthusiasm is a Passion guided by Judgment whose cause is not comprehended by us That it is a Passion is plain because it moves That the cause is not comprehended is selfevident That it ought to guided by Judgment is indubitable For otherwise it would be Madness and not Poetical Passion But now let us enquire what the cause of Poetical Enthusiasm is that has been hitherto not comprehended by us That Enthusiasm moves is plain to sence why then it mov'd the Writer But if it mov'd the Writer it mov'd him while he was thinking Now what can move a man while he is thinking but the thoughts that are in his mind In short Enthusiasm as well as ordinary Passions must proceed from the  thoughts as the Passions of all reasonable creatures must certainly do but the reason why we know not the causes of Enthusiastick as well as of ordinary Passions is because we are not so us'd to them and because they proceed from thoughts that latently and unobserv'd by us carry Passion along with them Here it would be no hard matter to prove that most of our thoughts are naturally attended with some sort and some degree of Passion And 'tis the expression of this Passion which gives us so much pleasure both in Conversation and in Human Authors For I appeal to any man who is not altogether a Philosopher whether he is not most pleas'd with Conversation and Books that are Spirited Now how can this Spirit please him but because it moves him or what can move him but Passion We never speak for so much as a minute together withont different inflexions of voice Now any one will find upon reflection that these variations and those inflexions mark our different passions But all this passes unregarded by us by reason of long use and the incredible celerity of our thoughts  whose motion is so swift that it is even to our selves imperceptible unless we come to reflect and every one will not be at the trouble of that Now these passions when they grow strong I call Enthusiastick motions and the stronger they are the greater the Enthusiasm must be If any one asks what sort of passions these are that thus unknown to us flow from these thoughts to him I answer that the same sort of passions flow from the thoughts that would do from the things of which those thoughts are Ideas As for example if the thing that we think of is great when then admiration attends the Idea of it and if it is very great amazement If the thing is pleasing and delightful why then Joy and Gayety flow from the Idea of it if it is sad melancholy if 'tis mischievous and powerful then the Imagination of it is attended with Terror And if 'tis both great and likely to do hurt and powerful why then the thought of it is at once accompanied with Wonder Terror and Astonishment Add to all this that the mind producing these thoughts conceives by reflection a certain Pride and Joy and Admiration as  at the conscious view of its own excellence Now he who strictly examines the Enthusiasm that is to be met with in the greater Poetry will find that it is nothing but the foremention'd passions either simple or complicated proceeding from the thoughts from which they naturally flow as being the thoughts or Images of things that carry those passions along with them as we shall shew by examples in the following Chapter  But these passions that attend upon our thoughts are seldom so strong as they are in those kind of thoughts which we call Images For they being the very lively pictures of the things which they represent set them as it were before our very eyes But Images are ne+ver so admirably drawn as when they are drawn in motion especially if the motion is violent For the mind can never imagine violent motion without being in a violent agitation it self and the Imagination being fir'd with that Agitation sets the very things before our eyes and consequently makes us have the same passions that we should have from the things themselves For the warmer the Imagination is the more  present the things are to us of which we draw the Images and therefore when once the Imagination is so inflam'd as to get the better of the understanding there is no difference between the Images and the things themselves as we see for example in Fevers and Mad men  Thus have we shewn that Enthusiasm flows from the thoughts and consequently from the subject from which the thoughts proceed For as the Spirit in Poetry is to be proportion'd to the Thought for otherwise it does not naturally flow from it and consequently is not guided by Judgment so the Thought is to be proportion'd to the Subject Now no Subject is so capable of supplying us with thoughts that necessarily produce these great and strong Enthusiasms as a Religious Subject For all which is great in Religion is most exalted and amazing all that is joyful is transporting all that is sad is dismal and all that is terrible is astonishing  CHAP VII The Causes of Poetical Enthusiasm shewn by Examples  THe Enthusiasm that is found in Poetry is nothing but the forementioned passions Admiration Joy Terror Astonishment flowing from the thoughts which naturally produce them For Admiration together with that Pride which exalts the soul at the conceiving a great Hint gives elevation Joy if 'tis great gives transport and astonishment gives vehemence But now let us shew by examples how this was done and let us begin with that Admirable Ode of  Horace  which is the third of the Third Book  Justum Tenacem propositi virum  Non civium ardor prava Jubentium  Non vultus instantis Tyranni  Mente quatit solida neque Auster  Dux Inquieti Turbidus Adriae  Nec fulmin antis magna Jovis manus  Se fractus Illabatur Orbis  Impavidum ferient Ruinae  That is  The man the brave man who is resolv'd upon a right and a firm principle is sure never to have his solid vertue shaken neither by the rage of the giddy multitude nor by the frowns of an insulting Tyrant nor by the Fury of the Roaring South that Turbulent Ruler of the Tempestuous  Adria  no nor by the Red Right Hand of Thundring  Jove  Nay should the World's disjointed Frame come rushing down with a Dismal Sound upon him its Ruines might Crush but they could never Shake him  Now 'tis plain that in the original there is a great deal of Enthusiasm But let us observe a little what this Enthusiasm is Upon observation we shall find then that in the forementioned Verses there is Elevation Severity and Vehemence and consequently there is something Admirable in them and Terrible and Astonishing Now why should we feel these passions in reading these thoughts unless the passions naturally attend them when they are express'd as  they should be But Admiration as we have said above must come from something that is great and Terror from something that is powerful and likely to hurt and Astonishment from something that is very Terrible and very likely to hurt that is from things that are so or from their Idea's The Reader upon examining the foremention'd Verses will find that the thoughts in them all are great and terrible and some of them are astonishing  But here I desire the Reader to observe three things First the admirable gradation of Thought here How the Poet rises from something that is Terrible to something that is more Terrible till he comes at last to something Astonishing and Amazing How from the Rage of the Mad Multitude he proceeds to the frowns of a Tyrant that stands threatning by How he rises from thence to a storm at Sea and from thence to the wrath of  Jove  express'd in the dreadful Thunder and from thence to the final dismal Dissolution of all things The next thing that I desire him to observe is How the Spirit of the Poet rises with his Thoughts which  is a sure sign that the one is nothing but the passions that attend on the other And the third thing that the Reader is to remark is that the Poet could not carry his Enthusiasm higher after the second thought without having recourse to Religion For he who knows any thing of the Pagan system knows that the three last thoughts are taken from their Religion  Let us now set before the Reader an Image that only by its greatness will move him and exalt him The passage is in the first Book of  Milton  's  Paradice Lost  where he thus describes  Lucifer  He above the rest  In shape and gesture proudly eminent  Stood like a Towr his form had yet not lost  All her original Brightness nor appear'd  Less than Archangel ruin'd and th' excess  Of Glory obscur'd as when the Sun new risn  Looks thro the Horizontal misty Air  Shorn of his Beams or from behind a Cloud▪  In dim Eclipse Disastrous Twilight sheds  On half the Nations and with fear of change  Perplexes Monarchs Darkned so yet shone  Above them all th' Archangel but his Face  Deep Scars of Thunder had Intrench'd  I desire the Reader would give himself the trouble of comparing these ten lines with the ten that preceded them and then to tell me why the Spirit should be so much greater in these than it is in the others unless it proceeded from the greatness of the Ideas or how the greatness of the Ideas could cause it but by infusing into the Poet admiration and a noble pride which express'd make the Spirit which is stately and majestick till the last and then it grows vehement because the Idea which causes it is not only great but very Terrible For all the afflicting Passions that are violent are express'd with vehemence The Reader cannot but observe of himself that the greatest of these noble Ideas is taken from Religion  But his Face  Deep Scars of Thunder had Intrench'd  Now let us consider two very masterly Images out of the Second Book of  Virgil  the first is the Hewing down of a Tree which appear'd so admirable to  Julius Scaliger  that he affirm'd that  Jupiter  could never have mended it and the second gave occasion for that Incomparable Statue of  Laocoon  which I saw at  Rome  in the Gardens of  Beluidere  and which is so astonishing that it does not appear to be the work of Art but the miserable Creature himself like  Niobe  benumm'd and petrify'd with grief and horror  The first besides its Greatness carries Terror along with it  Virgil  compares the Destruction of  Troy  which had been ten years besieg'd to the fall of a Mountain Ash at whose Root the labouring Swains had been a long time hewing with their Axes  Ac veluti summis antiquam in montibus ornum  Cum ferro accisam crebris{que} bipennibus instant  Eruere Agricolae certatim illa us{que} minatur  Et Tremefacta Comam concusso vertice nutat  Volneribus Donec Paulatim evicta supremum  Congemuit traxit{que} Jugis avolsa ruinam  And as when sturdy Swains with frequent strokes  Hewing with all their stretcht out arms let drive  At the firm Root of some aspiring Oak  Which long the Glory of the Mountain stood  That ev'ry moment formidably nods  And shakes the lofty glories of its crown  Till broken by repeated wounds at last  Down it comes rushing with a fatal groan  And tears the Earth and rends the solid Rock  And still is Dreadful in its hideous fall  Now here I desire the Reader to consider how the Poet raises his Spirit as soon as he sets his Image in motion and brings in Terror to his relief  Illa us{que} minatur  Et tremefacta comam concusso vertice mutat  For all the passions when they are very great carry Fury along with them and all the afflicting passions together with Fury carry Vehemence and Severity  And the Poet hereby setting his Image in motion had set it before his eyes and so made it the more terrible Let us now consider that of  Laocoon  Laocoon Ductus Neptuno sorte Sacerdos  Sollennes Taurum Ingentem mactabat ad aras  Ecce autem gemini a Tenedo Tranquilla per alta  Horresco referens Immensis Orbibus Angues  Incumbunt pelago pariter{que} ad littera tendunt  Pectora quorum inter fluctus arrecta Jubae{que}  Sanguineae exuperant undas pars

the Priest direct their flaming way  And of his little Sons each seizing one  Around their Limbs they twine their snaky Spires  And on their little trembling Joynts they feed  A dismal Feast and while their wretched Sire  With piercing shrieks comes rushing to their aid  At him with Fury both at once they dart  And clasping him with their vast pois'nous folds  Twice round his Waste they twist and twice his Neck  And stretching o're his Head their dismal Head  And lofty Crests upon the dying wretch  They dreadfully look down He all in vain  With all his might his brawny Muscles strains  And stretches his extended arms to tear  The pois'nous and inextricable folds  And from their entrails squeezes horrid gore  And now tormented hideously he roars  And stamping stares from his distracted eyes  Thus madly bounds about the impetuous Bull  When from his wound he shakes th' uncertain Axe  And Bellowing from the Bloody Altar broke  And now here we find a deal of Enthusiasm which is nothing but the elevation and vehemence and fury proceeding from the Great and Terrible and Horrible Ideas For the Poet setting his Image in so much motion and expressing it with so much action his inflam'd Imagination set it before his very eyes so that he participated of the Danger which he describ'd was shaken by the Terror and shiver'd with the Horror▪  And what is it but the expression of the passions he felt that moves the Reader in such an extraordinary manner But here let us observe how the Spirit of the Poet rises as the Danger comes nearer and the Terror grows upon him  Jamque aroa tenebint  Ardentesque oculos  c  And now they land  c  Let us consider beside what prodigious force all this must have in the connexion where Religion adds to the Terror encreases the Astonishment and augments the Horror For 'twas by the direction of  Minerva  that this Terrible Incident was brought about who had combin'd with  Juno  to destroy the  Trojans  as has been at large declar'd in a former Critical Treatise And thus we have endeavour'd to shew how the Enthusiasm proceeds from the thoughts and consequently from the subject But one thing we have omitted that as thoughts produce the spirit the spirit produces and makes the expression which is known by experience to all  who are Poets for never any one while he was wrapt with Enthusiasm wanted either Words or Harmony and is selfevident to all who consider that the Expression conveys and shows the Spirit and therefore must be produced by it So that from what we have said we may venture to lay down this Definition of Poetical Genius Poetical Genius in a Poem is the true expressions of Ordinary or Enthusiastick Passion proceeding from Ideas to which it naturally belongs and Poetical Genius in a Poet is the power of expressing such Passion worthily And the sublime is a great thought exprest with the Enthusiasm that belongs to it which the Reader will find Agreeable to the Doctrine of  Cecilius Longinus  I must confess has not told us what the sublime is because  Cecilius  it seems had done that before him Tho methinks it was a very great fault in so great a Man as  Longinus  to write a Book which could not be understood but by another Mans Writings especially when he saw that those Writings were so very defective that they were not likely to last But tho  Longinus  does not directly tell us what the Sublime is yet in the first six or seven Chapters of his Book he takes a great deal of pains to set before us the effects which it produces in the minds of Men as for example that it causes in them admiration and surprize a noble Pride and a noble Vigour an invincible force transporting the Soul from its ordinary Situation and a Transport and a fulness of Joy mingled with Astonishment These are the effects that  Longinus  tells us that the Sublime produces in the minds of men Now I have endeavour'd to shew what it is in Poetry that works these effects So that take the Cause and the Effects together and you have the Sublime  CHAP VIII Recapitulation and that the Subjects of the Ancients in their greater Poetry were Sacred  WE have now shewn that if the Ancients excel the Moderns in Epick Poetry in Tragedy and in the greater Ode they derive not their preheminence from any external nor from any internal advantage abstracted from the nature of the subject and that consequently they must draw it from the nature of the subject itself Then we shew'd that the greatest difference between one subject and another is that of Sacred and Prophane Then we shew'd that Passion was the chief thing in Poetry and great Passion in great Poetry and that either ordinary Passion or Enthusiasm Then we shew'd that Sacred subjects were as susceptible of ordinary Passion as the Prophane and more susceptible of the Enthusiastick which  last we shew'd by Reason and by Example So that to give a convincing Reason why the Ancients did and must for the most part excel the Moderns in Epick Poetry in Tragedy and the greater Ode we have nothing to do but to shew that those Poems among the Ancients were always Sacred because it is very well known that among the Moderns they are for the most part Prophane First then for Tragedy that is very well known to have been Sacred in its institution and it is full as plain that it must have been Sacred in its original Nature and after that the Episodes began to Intrench upon the Chorus it still continued Sacred as having Apostrophes Revelations Invocations Machines And so had the greater Ode And as for Epick Poetry in that the eldest of the Muses after the first Invocation was believed to Dictate every thing besides that the Gods were every where introduced in it and all things were done by their Ministery For which Reason it's apparent that the Moderns in these sort of Poems writing upon Prophane Subjects cannot possibly equal the Ancients supposing  these last to have had but an equal share of Genius with them  CHAP IX That the Ancient Poets deriv'd their preheminence from Religion shewn by several other things and first from this that they did not excel the Moderns in Poetry in which they made no use of Religion  THat the Ancients in the  Epos  in the Ode and in Tragedy deriv'd their preheminence from Religion may appear from several things that have not yet been mention'd and first of all from this that they did not excel the Moderns in Poetry in which they drew no advantage from Religion as in Comedy and in Satyr and that in Historical Poetry as the  Pharsalia  of  Lucan  whenever the Ancients excell'd the Moderns they drew their advantage from Religion  For Comedy the Ancients are so far from excelling the Moderns in it that the advantage is clearly on our side For I shall make no scruple of preferring  Moliere  and two or three of our own Comick Poets to  Terence  and  Aristophanes  For whether the design of Comedy be to instruct or to please or both the Modern Comedy answers both those ends incomparably better than the Ancient If the end of Comedy be only to please why then it must please by the  Ridiculum  for that which is the end of any sort of Writing whatever must be attain'd by a way that must distinguish that sort of Writing As for example the end of Tragedy and of Epick Poetry is to instruct But the latter instructs chiefly by Admiration and the former by Compassion and Terror Now Admiration distinguishes Heroick Poetry and Compassion and Terror Tragedy from all other sorts of Poems whatever but the only thing that distinguishes the pleasure which Comedy gives us from the pleasure that we receive from all other sorts of Poems whatever is the  Ridiculum  Now the  Ridiculum  in the Modern Comedy is beyond Comparison Higher than it is in  the new Comedy of the Ancients and beyond Comparison more in Nature than it is in the old one And it is higher both in the Incidents and in the Characters For if the end of Comedy is to please and that end is to be attain'd by the  Ridiculum  why then the  Ridiculum  ought to be spread throughout it But besides that it is higher in the Modern Comedy there is a greater variety of it both in the Incidents and in the Characters and that variety must make it the more delightful For a uniformity in this case takes away from the surprize and without surprize the  Ridiculum  cannot subsist And besides that the Moderns have a greater variety both of Characters and Fables they have a greater variety of Style For the Style of the Comedy of the Ancients and particularly of  Terence  his Comedy does not seem to me to be varied enough nor proportioned enough to the Characters The Slave in  Terence  speaks with the same Elegance and the same Grace for the most part that his Master does But look into the Plain Dealer and you shall find as many Styles in it as there are Characters For  Manly    Freeman    Plansible    Oliviae    Novel    Elisha    the Widow  Blackacre  and  Jerry  have each of them a different Dialect which besides the variety must be further delightful because it is an exact Imitation of Nature For as every man has a different form of face he has a different turn of mind and consequently a different cast of thought and a different manner of expression Add to this that the Moderns seem to know men better and to dive into some latent foibles into some Ridiculous Recesses that were utterly unknown to the Ancients So that in every good Comedy at the same time that we are diverted with the  Ridiculum  we are entertained with Discoveries which is very delightful But if the chief design of Comedy be to instruct as I make no question but it is because publick spectacles ought to contribute to the publick advantage we shall find that the Modern Comedy arswers this end too better than that of the Antients If the design of Comedy be to instruct it must instruct by the  Ridiculum  for the very same Reason that we affirm'd it must please by it because it is to be distinguished by the means by which it attains its end But nothing but the  Ridiculum  can distinguish  Comedy from all other Poems But Comedy instructing by the  Ridiculum  that  Ridiculum  ought to be both in the Fables and Characters First it ought to be in the Characters or else it cannot be in the Incidents and consequently there can be no Comedy For the manners of the Agents produce the Incidents Secondly it ought to be in the Incidents or else it would follow that there would be manners in the Agents which are not productive of action which ought not to be Besides Comedy instructs by its Fables or Characters or both If it instructs only by its Characters as some Criticks have thought yet the  Ridiculum  ought to be in the Action too or the seriousness of the Incidents would check the instruction as well as the pleasure which we receive from the Characters But if it instructs by its Fable and Action as certainly it ought to do why then the  Ridiculum  must be in the incidents which are parts of the Action because Comedy instructs by the  Ridiculum  and consequently this last ought to reign chiefly in the Catastrophe which ought to be the most instructive part of the Fable and  to make the strongest impression Besides there are but two ways of instructing by example and those are the shewing men Ridiculous for their faults or unfortunate to represent them expos'd by them or chastis'd for them But if Comedy shews men unfortunate it usurps upon Tragedy The great Disorders of the world are caus'd by great Passions and they are punish'd by Tragedy The little Passions cause little Disquiets and make us uneasie to our selves and one another and they are expos'd by Comedy For that which we call Humour in Comedy is nothing but a little Ridiculous passion and the exposing it in Comedy is thought to be Poetical Justice sufficient for it Not but that at last the Characters in Comedy may be chastiz'd at the Catastrophe for faults which they have committed but that very Chastisement ought to be wrapt up in the  Ridiculum  or the Catastrophe cannot be truly Comical For as the Catastrophe of a Tragedy ought to be the most Tragical part of it because Tragedy instructing by Compassion and Terror those two Passions ought to be most strongly mov'd in the most Instructive part of the Fable so the Catastrophe  of a Comedy ought to be the most Comical part of it for the very same reason for Comedy instructing by the  Ridiculum  as has been shewn above the most Instructive part of it ought to be most Ridiculous But now if 'tis the end of Comedy to Instruct and it instructs by the  Ridiculum  the Modern Comedy must be more Instructive than the Ancient could be For the  Ridiculum  in the old Comedy of the Ancients was very often out of Nature both in the Characters and in the Incidents and consequently could not instruct And the  Ridiculum  in their new Comedy being not so strong as it is in ours neither in their Characters not in their Incidents could not Insttuct so powerfully and the Moderns having greater variety of it both in their persons and action the Instruction in the Modern Comedy must be the more extensive besides that the variety of Action and Incidents must make our Catastrophes more surprizing and consequently more Ridiculous  So that the Modern Comedy pleasing more and instructing more and so answering the two ends of Comedy better than the Ancient did it follows that  the Moderns in Comedy are preferrable to the Ancients  As the Moderns have excell'd the Ancients in Comedy they have equall'd them in Satyr There has been a long dispute among the Criticks whether  Horace  or  Juvenal  ought to be preferr'd in Satyr Their excellencies indeed are are very different and therefore a Comparison is not easie to be made  Horace  had a great deal of pleasantry and  Juvenal  a great deal of force at least for his way of writing Now  Boilean  has justly got a great Reputation both for force and pleasantry and consequently is equal to either of the  Roman  Satyrists And here it will not be amiss to observe that the very same Poets among the Moderns who have surpass'd the Ancients in Comedy and who have equall'd them in Satyr have faln infinitely short of them when they have attempted the greater Poetry as  Ben Johnson  comes behind them in Tragedy and  Boilean  in the greater Ode  As for Historical Poetry any one who is acquainted with  Lucan  may have observ'd that where that Author is very great he derives his greatness from Religion as he does for example in  Cato  's  Speech which is a kind of Abstract of the Religion and Metaphysicks of the Stoicks  Ille Deo plenus tacitâ quem mente gerebat  Effudit Dignas Adytis e pectore voces  Quid quaeri Labiene Jabes An liber in armis  Occubuisse

mighty confidents of Fate  Her Irreversible Decrees my constancy create  Alike the Coward and the Brave must fall  This mighty  Jove  has once declar'd for all  And these inspiring sounds to  Roman  actions call  Lucan  is very far from being so exalted every where as he is here For  whereever he is very great and poetical he must be so by the greatness of ordinary passion or by the force of Enthusiasm But ordinary passions can neither be very frequent in an Historical Poem nor if they could could they be frequently great Because there being no Fable and no Art they can seldom be rightly prepar'd Nor can the Enthusiasms be frequently great where there is no Religion But Religion cannot be frequent in an Historical Poem unless it is in Sacred History If any one would give himself the trouble of comparing the Twelfth Book of the  Aeneis  with the seventh of the  Pharsalia  he would find that  Virgil  is ten times greater than  Lucan  and that  Lucan  's subject as far as it is Humane is ten times greater than  Virgil  's For I hope no man will compare  Aeneas  take him without his Divine Dependencies with  Julius Caesar  the greatest of men nor the Combat that made the former King of the  Latins  with the Battel that made  Caesar  the Absolute Master of the World From whence it would follow if the greatness of  Virgil  's Subject consists in any thing Humane that either  Lucan  's writing in his Seventh Book is twenty  times below his Subject or that the Writing of  Virgil  in his Twelfth Book is twenty times above his But  Lucan  's writing in his Seventh Book is not twenty times below his Subject as any Modern Poet that should be oblig'd to handle that Subject after him would be forc'd to confess Nor is the writing of  Virgil  in the last of the  Aeneis  so many degrees above his subject For if it is then that last Book is scurvily writ because the thoughts and expressions ought to be proportion'd to the things But the last Book of the  Aeneis  is admirably writ What then can be the meaning of all this Why the meaning must be that  Virgil  's subject is twenty times greater than  Lucan  's But  Lucan  's subject is ten times greater than his as far as it is only Humane which has been made to appear The excellency then of  Virgil  's subject must come from something that is not Humane and that must be from Religion so  Virgil  's greatness and his Enthusiasm comes from his Machines and the Ministery of the Gods and the other parts of his Religion and  Lucan  's littleness from his want of those Machines and that Ministery▪  Petronius  Arbiter    Lucan  's Contemporary was very sensible of this For he tho an Epicurean profest was so sensible of the Advantage that Poetry deriv'd from Religion that in the Beginning of his  Satyricon  after he has been exclaiming against the Writers of the Times and particularly against  Lucan  he offers this expedient for the restoring Poetry to its former greatness that they should restore it to its former Religion But to return to  Lucan  He is often tedious and spiritless because his Subject is not only meerly Humane but it's sometimes Impious For  Lucan  had conceiv'd the most extravagant Design in the World For at the same time that he sets up for a Stoick he writes a Book to prove either that there is no such thing as Providence in the World or that the Gods favour'd Injustice  Victrix Causa Deis placuit sed vict a Catoni  Before I make an end of this Chapter I beg the Reader's leave that I may digress for a moment because the digression is of very great importance to Poetry  We have shewn that the Subject of  Virgil  in the Twelfth of his  Aeneis  is very much greater than  Lucan  's is in the Seventh of his  Pharsalia  We have shewn too at the same time that  Lucan  's was greater as He found it and that  Virgil  's was greater as He made it For I hope I need say nothing at this time of day to prove that the Religious part of  Virgil  's Subject was Invented and Dispos'd by the Poet Which may show the benefit of Art that is of Rules in Poetry For tho 'tis by the Genius of a Writer that is by a Soul that has the power of expressing great Passions whether ordinary or Enthusiastick that we treat a Subject with Dignity equal to its greatness yet 'tis Art that makes a Subject very great and consequently gives occasion for a great Genius to shew it self  And thus we have shewn that the Ancients did not excel the Moderns in Comedy and Satyr which are not Sacred Poems as having neither Invocations Apostrophes Revelations or Machines at least the new Comedy had none of all these and the old one only some low Burlesque or else Grotesque ones We have shewn too that the Sacred Poetry  of the Ancients was beyond comparison greater than their Historical Poetry because it was not Sacred  CHAP X That in their Sacred Poetry in which the Ancients excell'd the Moderns those places were greatest and most Poetical that had most of Religion  But as the Ancients did not surpass the Moderns in Poetry that was not Sacred so in that sort of Poetry where they did excel them they were never so admirable as where they were most Religious Now the passages of the Ancient Poets which seem to have most Religion in them are either those addresses by which men approach'd the Gods as Invocations Apostrophes and the like or those condescensions by which the Gods communicated themselves to men as Revelations Machines  c  the first of which are Duties that belong to universal Natural Religion the second to Religion which is Reveal'd Extraordinary and Miraculous Every thing that is great in Poetry must be great by the Genius that is felt in it which is the chief thing in Poetry according to the general acceptation of it and the principal thing in the  Materia Poetica  or the Body of Poetry Now all Genius is Passion because it moves and all Passion is either Enthusiasm or ordinary Passion as we declar'd above Now that even ordinary Passion in Poetry is heighten'd by Religion we shall endeavour to prove And we shall most insist upon those ordinary Passions which are most to be found in Tragedy and in Epick Poetry For as for the greater Ode that seems to be the peculiar province of Enthusiasm and ordinary Passions in that are more rarely to be met with  First then Admiration which is the Reigning Passion in Epick Poetry I mean that which is admirable in the action of the Hero is heighten'd by Revelations by Machines and the Ministration of the Gods For that Ministration  those Machines and those Revelations are all Miraculous And the man who was admirable before for his extraordinary Valour and his Native Greatness becomes more wonderful when we behold him the esteem and immediate concern of Heaven when we see him the 'peculiar care of Providence when we find the order of Nature inverted the Skies grown factious upon his account and Gods descending to sustain or oppose him  But Secondly Terror and Compassion which are the Reigning Passions in Tragedy are Heighten'd by Religion Tragedy says  Aristotle  in his Poetick is the Imitation of an action which excites Compassion and Terror Now those two Passions proceed from Surprize when the Incidents spring one from another against our expectation For those Incidents continues the Philosopher are always more admirable than those which arrive by chance which is evident from this says he that even of accidental things those are always the most wonderful and most surprizing which at the same time that  they arrive by Chance seem to fall out by Design and by a certain particular secret conduct of which Nature was what they relate of the Statue of  Mitys  at  Argos  which fell upon his Murderer and kill'd him upon the spot in the midst of a great Assembly For that by no means says the Philosopher seems to be the work of Chance From whence ir follows says he of necessity that those Fables where there is this conduct will always seem preferable to those that have it not Thus  Aristotle  declares that the Wonderful in Tragedy as well as in Epick Poetry is Heightned by Religion that those Tragical Incidents that appear to have most of Providence in them are always most moving and Terrible The Reason is plain For all cur Passions are grounded upon the Love of our selves and Terror and Compassion spring from the Calamities of our equals that is of those who being in circumstances resembling ours and committing faults which we either commit or to which we are liable are upon that unfortunate For the more there appears to be of Providence in the punishment the more we pity the persons  For if their calamities appear to be the work of Chance they might as well have hapned to those who have not committed such faults as to those who have And therefore a Train of Incidents which contrary to our expectation surprizingly produce one another is necessary because the more plainly the punishment appears the result of the faults and the more clearly we are convinc'd of this when we least expect it Providence appears the more in the case and our security is shaken the more and the more we are mov'd and Terrified But Religion does not only heighten those Passions which are great in themselves as Admiration and Terror are for Admiration raises the Soul and every thing that is Terrible is certainly great to him to whom it is Terrible but it ennobles those which are commonly base and dejected as for example Grief witness that passage in the Passion of  Dido  Testatur moritura Deos conscia Fati Sydera  And that Noble Apostrophe afterwards  Sol qui Terrarem flammis c  And that Sublime Apostrophe of  Seinon  in the Second Book  Ille Dolis instructus arte pelasgâ  Sustulit exutas vinclis ad Sydera palmas  Vos eterni ignes non violabile vestrum  Numen ait vos arae enses{que} nefandi  Quos fugi vittae{que} Deum quas Hostia gessi c  But to come to the other sort of Passion which gives Poetry its force and its greatness Religious Enthusiasm must necessarily be greater than Human Enthusiasm can be because the Passions that attend on Religious Ideas when a man is capable of Reflecting on them as he should do are stronger than those which attend on Prophane Ideas as has been said above and has been partly shewn by examples And as ordinary Passion is Heightned by Religion so Human Enthusiastick Passions are heightned  by Religious Enthusiasm We shall give an example of this in Terror by which I mean not that Common Passion which  Aristotle  treats of in his Rhetorick and in his Poetick and of which we spoke in the former part of this Chapter but that Enthusiastick Terror which springs from the Ideas unknown to him who feels it  Virgil  in his first Book of the  Aeneis  describes a Tempest which carries Double Terror along with it the ordinary one which springs from the concern which we have for the Hero and the Enthusiastick one which the Ideas would carry along with them tho they were separated from that concern which we feel for the Hero The Description is Grave and Severe and Exalted because the Poet was mov'd by the Terrible Ideas For that which is Terrible is always great to him to whom it is Terrible as we said before and that which is Great is Admirable and then he who is Terrified is always serious and very much in Earnest The same Description where the Terror is at the Height is vehement  Insequitur cumulo praeruptus aquae Mons  Hi summo in fluctu pendent his unda Dehiscens  Terram inter fluctus aperit furit aestus arenis  Because that which is very Terrible is Wonderful and Astonishing and he who is astonish'd being transported beyond himself must of necessity express himself with that sort of Fury which we call Vehemence  Virgil  by setting so many Terrible Images in motion had set this Tempest before his Eyes or rather had transported himself as it were into it Now any one who has been upon the brink of a Wreck and consequently has been very much Terrify'd himself and seen others Astonish'd cannot but have felt the same motions that he feels in Reading this passage and cannot but have observ'd that others who felt them express'd themselves with the same Fury and Vehemence that the Poet does tho not with the same Elegance But tho this Storm is Terrible in it self and Wonderful yet the Machines which prepare and raise and allay it very much add to its Greatness  and genuine Terror and it is quite another thing when it is consider'd with the cause of it which is the Anger of  Juno  and the Compliance of  Aeolus  and with that which follow'd upon it which is the Indignation of  Neptune  and the exertion of his absolute power  The passages of the Ancient Poets that were most Religious were their Invocations Apostrophes or the like or those which contain'd the Miraculous part of their Religion their Signs Apparitions Oracles and other Revelations  For their Invocations Apostrophes and the like which were all of them either a sort of Prayers or Divine Attestations they are most of them very sublime and attended with a strong Enthusiasm And how could it be otherwise but that the Ancient Poets who were men of great Learning of great Passions great Eloquence and great Parts when with study and pains and with all their endeavours to be Enthusiastick they address'd themselves to their Gods should be extremely agitated when we see very plainly that a sort of Modern Enthusiasts who have neither  Learning nor Parts nor the least tincture of good Letters are even in their Extempore Prayers disturb'd with very fierce Enthusiasms  For the Apostrophe we have given examples of it already and therefore we shall only say here that  Longinus  mentions it as one of the Figures that contribute the most to the Sublime For the Invocation we shall bring an Example of it from the seventh Book of  Virgil  and the Reader is desir'd to take notice what addition of Enthusiasm attends it  Nunc age qui reges Erato quae tempora rerum  Quis Latio antiquo fuerit status advena classem  Cum primum Ausoniis exercitus appulit oris  Expediam primae revocabo exordia pugnae  Tu natem tu diva mone dicam horrida bella  Dicam acies actosque animis in funera reges  Tyrrhenamque manum totamque sub arma coactam  Hesperiam major rerum mihi nascitur ordo  Majus opus mo  And from  Horace    Lib    Ode    Descende coelo dic age tibia  Regina long am Calliope Melos  Seu voce nunc mavis acuta  Seu fidibus citharave Phoebi  Auditis an me ludit Amabilis  Insania audire videor pios  Errare per lucos amoenae  Quos aqua subeunt aura  But to come to those passages of the Ancient Poems in which the Miraculous part of their Religion was contain'd and their Revelation more nearly concern'd as their Signs and Wonders and their private Inspirations but above all the Apparitions of their Gods and their Oracles it is no wonder if those passages speaking of things that strike mankind with the last Astonishment have almost all the Enthusiasm of which the mind of man is with Reason capable  Horace  is by no means a cold Writer and yet he is far from writing every where with the same degree of Fury and the same Rapture that he does in the beginning of the Nineteenth Ode of the Second Book  Baccham in remotis carmina rupibus  Vidi docentem credite posteri  Nymphas{que} discentes aures  Capripedum Satyrorum acutas  Evae recenti mens trepidat metu  Pleno{que} Bacchi pectore turbidum  Letatur Evae parce Liber  Parce gravi metuende thyrso  Nor is  Virgil  every where so Enthusiastick as he is in the beginning of the Sixth Book where the  Cumaean  Sibyl rages with the  Delphick  God  Ventum er at ad limen cum virgo poscere sata  Tempus ait Deus ecce Deus cui talia fanti  Ante fores subito non vultus non color unus  Non comtae mansere contae sed pectus anhelum  Et Rabie fera corda tument major{que} videri  Nee mortale sonans afflata est numine quando  Jam propiore Dei  The Hero now the Sacred Floor approach'd  When on a sudden the Prophetick Maid  This is the Fearful Time t' enquire of Fate  And said it with a voice and with a look  That now were hers no more  For raving Lo the God the God she cries  While half disclosing her distorted Face  Her Tresses in a wild disorder stare  And now she pants she swells she foams with Rage  And now her Shape looks hideous to the eye  And now she Thunders in a dreadful Tone  While all the Godhead raging in her Breast  With his tempestuous Spirit shakes her soul  In short any thing that immediately concerns Revelation has so great an Influence upon Poetry that it is able to change even the Nature of Writing and Exalt that very sort of Poetry which by its Character is Low and Humble as for Example the Eclogue The fourth Eclogue of  Virgil  will be easily granted by all to be very Sublime But what is it that makes it so Why there is at once in that Eclogue an Invocation and an Apostrophe and a Revelation of sundry Miracles to come The Fifth Eclogue between  Menalcas  and  Mopsus  begins with all the Humility and all the Simplicity that is proper and peculiar to the Eclogue  Men  Cur non Mopse boni quoniam convenimus Ambo  Tu Calamos in flare Leves ego Diecre versus  Hic corilis mixtas inter consedimus ulmos  And thus Mr  Duke  has with the same Simplicity translated it  Men Mopsus  Since Chance does us together bring  And you so well can Pipe and I can Sing  Why sit we not beneath this secret shade  By Elms and Hazels mingling Branches made  But this very  Menalcas  changes his Tone in a wonderful manner when in the same Eclogue he comes to the Apotheosis of  Daphnis  Candidus insueti miratur limen Olympi  Sub pedibus{que} videt Nubes sydera Daphnis  And you may easily see that the Gentleman who translated it who wants no  Genius felt the extream alteration of the Spirit  Daphnis  now wondring at the Glorious show  O're Heavens bright Pavement does Triumphant go  And sees the moving Clouds and the fixt Stars below  But let us see a little how  Virgil  goes on  Ergo Alacris Sylvas caetera rura voluptas  Pana{que} pastores{que} tenet Dryadas{que} puellas  Nic Lupus Insidias pecori nec Retia cervis  Ulla Dolum meditantur amat bonus otia Daphnis  Therefore new Joys make glad the Woods the Plains  Pan  and the  Dryades  and the chearful Swains  The Wolf no Ambush for the Flock does lay  No cheating Nets the harmless Deer betray  Daphnis  a General Peace Commands and Nature does obey  But  Virgil  goes on  Ipsi Letitia voces ad Sydera Jactant  Intonsi montes ipsae jam carmina Rupes  Ipsa sonant Arbusta Deus Deus Ille Menalca  Sis bonus o foelix{que} tuis  Hark the glad Mountains raise to Heav'n their voice  Hark the hard Rocks in mystick tunes rejoyce  Hark thro the Thickets wondrous Songs resound  A God a God  Menalcas  he is crown'd  O be propitious O be good to thine  But now 'tis time to ask a question What is the reason that  Virgil  who knew the Character of the Eclogue better than any man and who was so throughly convinc'd that the Discourses of Shepherds ought to be simple and their affections soft and gentle affections and who besides has been always us'd to introduce his persons speaking perfectly in their Characters should bring in  Menalcas  in this Eclogue talking in so exalted a manner and with so  strong an Enthusiasm Why he has given the Reason in the preceding Verses  Ipsae jam carmina Rupes  Ipsa sonant Arbusta Deus Deus Ille Menalca  'Tis that he was satisfied that very violent Enthusiasms flow so necessarily from the wonders of Religion that they were as natural to Shepherds as they were to Kings as being to both alike unavoidable But what Influence the Miraculous part of Religion had on the Ancient Poetry we shall discover more at large in the following Chapter  CHAP X That the  Grecian  Poetry flourish'd with their Religion  THe  Grecian  Religion flourish'd in  Greece  from the time of  Orpheus  who was either the Original Instituter  or at least a vehement propogater of that Idolatry till the Age after that in which  Sophocles  flourish'd that is for the space of about eight hundred years and in that space of time flourish'd all their Poets who are celebrated for their excellence in that sort of Poetry which we call Sacred Which alone is a strong presumption that these Poets deriv'd their excellence from Religion In short the advantage which their Poetry drew from Religion must needs be very considerable when for all or most of the foremention'd space of time according to the Testimony of  Plutatch  and several others of their authentick Writers it made most of their Zealots even their common people Poets and that even in their ordinary conversation I must confess the Gentleman who writ the History of Oracles treats this as a Fiction and a Fiction so palpable as not to be worth the answering But perhaps that Gentleman had not consider'd this matter enough For I desire the Reader to consider two things First the extraordinary incentives which those people had to Enthusiasm which is one qualification for Poetry and secondly  the habit which they might very probably contract of Versification To be satisfied of the first let us enquire a little into the nature of their Religion And upon enquiry we shall find that the very source and spring and soul of it was an imaginary or pretended Revelation and that that Revelation was suppos'd to be constant and continual as it must be of every Religion which has no sound Morality They had their publick and private Revelations as Oracles Visions Dreams Apparitions And Gods and Goddesses Nymphs and Demigods Fawns and Satyrs were seen by Imagination in every Grove on every Mountain and in every Valley as soon as either the Horrors of the place or its silence or their fears or their wishes or their contemplations had dispos'd their minds to be Religiously impos'd upon Now what sort of Passions and what sort of Spirit must be produc'd in them by these Imaginations we may guess by what happens among our selves when any one believes that he has seen an Apparition The man is alter'd quite in a moment his colour his mein his comportment are all different Nor are  they who hear him the same but are all of them surpriz'd transported astonish'd and all of them very profoundly attentive Now very few that have any Judgment have any Notion that an Apparition will do them any harm nor has any one an example of it that may be easily credited But the Ancient  Grecians  had notions that their Gods had power to destroy them or make them happy and they had a thousand Examples of it in  Museus  and  Orpheus  and  Homer  and the rest of the Fathers of their Church which must cause the Emotions upon the fancied Apparitions or the Relations of them to be the greater and fill their Souls with more turbulent Passions and a greater Religious Horror  But then let us consider secondly that these Zealots must in some measure have contracted a Habit of Versisication from their Religious duties For the very common People in  Greece  had with quick apprehensions a great deal of vivacity and therefore I leave the Reader to guess what effect the Reading  Museus  and  Homer  and  Orpheus  and the rest of the Fathers of their Church  for their whole lifetime must necessarily have had upon their Minds together with their Praying Praising Sacrificing and Thanksgiving in Verse Why may not they very well be supposed from all this to have contracted a Habit of Versifying  And why may not that Habit joyn'd to their continual Enthusiastick Motions which they had either from the Revelations which they fancied that the Gods imparted to themselves or from the Relations of those which they believed were vouchsafed to others or from the performance of the foresaid Religious Duties and from their Ritual which their Poets had compos'd with so much Enthusiasm capacitate them to express themselves Poetically even in common Society as well as some whole Sects of our Modern Fanaticks in  England  who have by no means the vivacity of the  Grecians  are enabled from the continual Reading of Scripture and the Imaginary Dictates of the private Spirit to make up their ordinary conversation almost wholly of Scripture language  But since these Visions and these Apparitions joyn'd to their constant Reading the Poets had such a mighty influence upon the people what must they not have had upon their Priests the Poets who having stronger pretences to those Revelations and more earnest and eager application to the Reading of the Poets who writ before them and who besides having strong Imaginations and great Passions and still greater Souls to command them were qualify'd to draw an extraordinary advantage from them When these whose peculiar business it was to take care of Religion at any time writ upon Religious Matters what Gravity what Severity what Elevation what Vehemence must they not necessarily derive from their subject  CHAP XII Objection answered  BUt here 'tis convenient to answer an Objection for here it will be urg'd that the Ancient Poets among the  Grecians  being men of extraordinary parts could not believe any thing so absurd as the Revelations and Miracles mention'd in the former Chapter and consequently could not draw any advantage from them To which I answer that first they might draw an advantage from them tho they did not believe them and secondly that they did believe them  First Supposing they did not believe them yet they might very well draw their advantage from them For every one is brought up in the Reveal'd Religion of his Country and consequently believes it for the first part of his life Now every one knows that the force of  Education and the Influence of first Impressions is great and especially upon the minds of those who have strong Imaginations And supposing that the Poets when they set themselves to write were not satisfied about the Truth of the Revelations of which they treated yet the former strong Enthusiastick motions that they were wont to have upon the like Ideas in the first years of their youth would certainly follow upon them again whenever they had heartily a mind to give into them  But secondly a man may have a very good understanding and yet believe a false nay even an absurd Revelation The Revelation of  Mahomet  is both false and absurd and yet several among the  Turks  who have shewn themselves men of extraordinary parts for several years together have at last convinc'd the world of the sincerity of their belief by very frankly submitting to die at the Command of their Emperors when they could with a great deal of ease have declin'd it For 'tis so reasonable to believe that there should be such a thing as Revelation of which we shall speak more at large anon and all Revelations  are so little to be comprehended by us that a man even of a good understanding will be oblig'd to believe an absurd one rather than none Besides the Ancient  Grecian  Poets knew no other Religion than the  Grecian  Revelation For they had neither any clear Idea of one Supreme Independent Being nor any tolerable knowledge of the Law of Nature For all the great Poets among the  Grecians  flourish'd before the Doctrine of  Socrates  was establish'd in the world and before that establishment they had neither any certain knowledge of the True God nor any tolerable notion of the Law of Nature For had there been that there would have been a system of Morality but  Socrates  was the first who introduc'd Moral Philosophy into that part of the world  And here the Mythologists may pretend as long as they please that the Ancient  Grecian  Poets by the number of their false Gods meant only the different notions of the true 'Tis plain they had no clear and distinct Idea of one Supreme and Infinite Being For either the Knowledge of the True God must be drawn from Reason or Revelation  From Revelation they could not draw it because their own Revelation was not true And if they had the knowledge of the true God from any other Revelation of which perhaps some of them might have heard imperfectly why then that knowledge was imperfect and could consequently not be clear And to deduce that knowledge from Reason a man must use a great deal of attention and a great deal of application But in those times the Corruption of the  Grecians  was too great and their Passions were too strong and the Exercise of Reason was too little known among them to use either the attention or the application But besides all this there is something in the Ancient  Grecian  Poets that is repugnant to the Divine Nature as is known to every one who has been conversant with them and that alone renders all the Conjectures of the Mythologists Ridiculous  And lastly we have a great deal of Reason to be convinc'd that the Ancient  Grecian  Poets I mean their Sacred Poets did believe the Revelations they neated of because as their Poetry flourish'd  with their Revelation so at last it fail'd with it as we shall shew at large in the following Chapter  CHAP XIII That the greater Poetry among the  Graecians  fail'd with their Religion  AS Epick Poetry Tragedy and the Greater Ode flourish'd with Religion among the Ancient  Grecians  so together with Religion they fail'd Now in order to the proving this let us enquire how and when the  Grecian  Religion fail'd We have said in one of the former Chapters that the very spring and soul of that Religion was a constant continual Revelation as it must necessarily have been of such a Religion as had no Morality The  Grecians  worshipp'd many Gods but before they worshipp'd them they must believe that they were and that they wanted neither power nor will to make them either happy  or miserablc Now of these two things they were convinc'd by Imaginary or pretended Revelations as by Oracles Visions Dreams Apparitions and a thousand Fantastick Miracles Now as long as these were in credit in  Greece  Polytheism went on Triumphantly For they who had neither any insight into the True Religion nor any tolerable habit of Reasoning could never argue against matter of Fact as long as they made no doubt of the Truth of it But as soon as the matter of fact came to be suspected the  Grecian  Worship was undermin'd and weaken'd very considerably To be convinc'd of this we need only consider the Design of that Revelation and the methods of carrying it on and we shall find that that very Design and those very Methods made a certain way for its ruine We have said above that no Religion which wants Morality can outlast its Revelation For if Morality is not for it it will be against it And 'tis impossible to conceive how any Religion can be permanent which has neither Miracles nor Human Reason to support it Now it will be an easie matter to shew two things first that  the  Grecian  Religion was without Motality and secondly that the very Design of it and the Methods of carrying on that Design introduc'd Moral Philosophy by a very natural preparation  The Design of the  Grecian  Religion seems to me to be the providing for the Happiness of Mankind in this life by drawing them out of a state of War and making them live peaceably and securely among one another  Sylvestres Homines Sacer Interpres{que} Deorum  Caedibus victu faedo deterruit Orpheus  Says  Horace  in his little Treatise  De Arte Poetica  That is  Orpheus  the Sacred Interpreter of the Gods deterr'd savage men from Murdering one another and reclaim'd them from the Barbarous Brutal lives which they led  Now this Design he was to bring about by Religion and Revealing the pretended will of the Gods In order to which it was necessary to give the people  such a Religion as might be agreeable to them in the condition in which they were For otherwise they would not have hearken'd to it Now to give them a Religion that might be agreeable to them it was necessary to give them such a one as might Maintain and Indulge their Passions For when the  Grecian  Worship was first instituted the corruption of that people was so very great that tho the Instituter had known the pure Law of Nature he durst never have preach'd it to them because their Passions were then too strong to receive it Well then  Orpheus  or  Linus  or whoever was the first Instituter of the  Grecian  Religion was oblig'd to Maintain and Indulge the Passions which I am apt to believe that he had no notion of suppressing because he believ'd them all to be natural and saw by experience that some of them contributed to the Pleasure and Happiness of Mankind The Instituter then of the  Grecian  Worship was oblig'd to Maintain the Passions but here lay the difficulty The very crimes that kept men asunder and in a state of War were caus'd by some of those very Passions what then was  to be done in this case Why He was oblig'd to give those Passions a diversion and to Indulge and Maintain the rest in the same condition in which he found them As for example Rage and Fury were the principal passions that maintain'd men in a state of War and occasion'd the frequent Murders that were daily committed among them Now these passions being grown up with them and by consequence become habitual to them it would have been very difficult if not impossible to suppress them The first Instituter then of the  Grecian  Religion thought fit to give those passions a vent a less cruel way and for that purpose in all likelihood instituted the  Orgies of Bacchus  But the passions that were not utterly inconsistent with Society he indulg'd in the condition in which he found them as the Love of Women Wine c For all that the Founder of that Religion could pretend to at first was to bring men out of a greater confusion into a less and not to reduce them to perfect order Therefore by shewing the Gods addicted to these passions he encourag'd the people to cherish them nay  to such an Intemperance as was repugnant to the original Law of Nature nay even to such a criminal degree as was afterwards forbidden by the Laws of the  Grecian  States For Intemperance in the use of Wine and of Women is contrary to the Dictates of Natures original Law and yet was encourag'd by the Examples of some of their Gods and Rapes and Adulteries and Incest were encourag'd by the same Examples at first without any manner of Countercheck For either the System of the  Grecian  Theology was contriv'd at first without any Infernal Punishments or they were only threaten'd to such crimes as were contradictory of civil Society But afterwards as Confusion lessen'd and Order increas'd and other Crimes were found to be more repugnant to Community and so were forbidden by the Laws the Magistrates in all likelihood oblig'd the succeeding Poets to threaten those who dar'd to commit them with the punishments of another World and so to make up the Infernal Scheme by Degrees Thus have I endeavour'd to shew by the most probable Conjectures I could make what was the  original Design of  Orpheus  and what method he took to compass it But this is past all doubt that the original Revelation of the  Grecian  Worship was Repugnant in several points to the primitive Law of Nature and the succeeding Laws of the  Grecian  States Now the method which  Orpheus  or whoever was the first founder of the  Grecian  Religion had taken was maintain'd by succeeding Poets only here and there as occasion serv'd they intermingled precepts of Justice and Temperance which precepts are by no means to be look'd upon as parts of that Revelation but as Remnants of Natural Religion and of the Law of Nature which the Passions had not been able totally to suppress or the efforts and strugglings of Reason recovering from its Lethargy by Degrees But the Poets and Lawgivers could not give good precepts with a great deal of good success as long as the Gods were believ'd to give ill examples For the people look'd upon their Laws unless they were inforc'd by Religion as made only for the conveniency of life and trangsgrest them whenever they could  with Impunity and the precepts scat ter'd up and down in the Poems wer but Impotent Imperfect efforts of Reason and utterly unable to prevail against a continual constant Revelation and a train of perpetual Miracles  But now let us consider how this Design of  Orpheus  or whoever was the first Instituter of the  Grecian  Religion let us see how his Design in setting up his Theology together with the Methods that were us'd for carrying it on by him and succeeding Poets secretly prepar'd the way for its utter ruine For the bringing men in a body together and causing them more frequently to converse with one another was the first occasion of the cultivating Humane Reason and was consequently one preparation to the Introduction of Moral Philosophy  And the Laws that were made by their Legislators and the Precepts that were given by their Priests and Poets in consequence of mens convening and conversing together had been sensible encroachments upon the Revelation as being manifest contradictions of it if men had been us'd to reflect At last  after Miracles and Revelations had prevailed for the space of almost eight hundred years  Socrates  arose a most extraordinary man who finding that the Precepts that had been scattered here and there for the Regulation of Humane Life and the Laws that had been given for the maintaining of Order in Communities were all contradictory of the Revelation but all agreeing perfectly with one another in the promoting of the same Design which was the welfare of those who observ'd them he had reason to enquire a little more narrowly into the Revelation and to find that that was contradictory too of it self For the Celestial and the Infernal Schemes of the Ancient  Grecian  Theology seem'd so utterly inconsistent that as I hinted before they could never be conceiv'd to be both given ou't at a time but it was reasonable to believe that first the Celestial Scheme was invented and afterwards the Infernal made up by degrees in order to the serving the ends of Government For not only the Infernal Deities rigorously punish'd those very Crimes which the Celestial Gods had by their Examples encourag'd men to  commit but which is very odd to con+sider their Hell seem'd to be fill'd with their Good Gods and their Heaven with Devils For whether we consider  Plato  or  Proserpine  or the Judges or the Fates or the Furies these were all of them very rigorous and if you please inexorable but then they were all of them very just and foes and inexorabie only to guilt and never any of them did any harm to Virtue But at the same time that the Magistracy of Hell was compos'd of these honest upright Persons Heaven on the other side was fill'd with all sorrs of Scoundrels Rakes Cuckolds Bullies Pimps and Bawds and Cuckold makers and no Virtue and no Innocence could secure either Men or Women from these Immortal Scowrers Nay men often suffer'd for their Temperance and women for their Chastity  Socrates  then considering the absurdity of the Revelation and the Reasonableness of the Laws and Precepts that were distinct from it The agreement of the latter among themselves and the inconsistency of the former cultivated the one and contemn'd the other and by the force of a strong and clear Reason  and a long conversation with all sorts of people brought the Exercise and Habit of reasoning into Request and by little and little introduced a system of Morality restor'd in some measure Natural Religion and recover'd the Law of Nature Thus  Socrates  gave the world a System of Morality and tho his Contemporaries had not reason enough to make the discovery themselves yet they had sense enough to approve of it when it was made and to be convinc'd of the Truth of it and consequently to be satisfy'd that the Revelation was false For seeing that Virtue and Order and Happiness I mean in some degree sprung from Philosophy and Vice and Confusion and Misery from the Revelation and seeing the Philosophy was establish'd by Inferences which very naturally flow'd from these Intelligent Faculties which whatever power had form'd man had given him to be his guide and seeing the Philosophy and the Revelation contradictory one of another they could not find in their hearts to believe that the Gods could be so unjust as to design the misery and confusion of Mankind or so absurd as to give them two  rules to walk by that were contradictory one of another  The establistment then of Moral Philosophy was the ruine of the old Revelation and so made way for a new For after the death of  Socrates  there started up several Sects of Philosophers as the  Cyrenaicks    Cynicks    Peripateticks    Epicureans    Scepticks  some of them immediately but all within a hundred and fifty years who were all of them mortal Enemies not only to the  Grecian  Revelation but to Reveal'd Religion in general Tho in the last they certainly went beyond the design of their common Master  Socrates  whose intention was to reform Revelation and not to ruin it And thus upon the establishment of Moral Philosophy the credit of Oracles was diminish'd considerably and Apparitions Visions c were contemn'd and exploded and with them down went the greater Poetry for you will find upon enquiry that there was no Poet among the  Grecians  who was born after the death of  Socrates  who writ with a great Spirit  CHAP XIV That the Greater Poetry among the  Romans  flourish'd and fail'd with their Religion  THat the  Grecians  deriv'd their preheminence in the greater Poetry from Religion may appear not only because they flourish'd and decay'd toge+ther but because the  Romans  whose Country was not like  Greece  the Scene of perpetual Miracles and who for a long time had no correspondence with  Greece  had no such thing as the Spirit of Poetry among them till they came to Conquer that Country  Graecia capta ferum victorem caepit artes  Insulit Agresti Latio  For there was something in the Institution of the  Roman  Religion as it was establish'd by  Numa Pamphilius  that lessen'd the credit of Divine Apparitions considerably  'Tis true  Numa  founded his Sa+cred Establishment upon the Authority of Apparitions but at the same time that he profest a familiarity with the Goddess  Aegeria  and with the Muses  Plut  Life of  Numa  he taught the people that no resemblance of the Gods could be made nor any likeness to represent them The first was a Fiction to serve a turn in Politicks and the latter a Truth that was contradictory of the other And he had need have very gross people to deal with that could swallow such a contradiction as that For if no Form or Likeness of the Gods could be made in what Likeness could they appear to him or how could he distinguish  Aegeria  from the Muses or the Muses from one another I am apt to believe that  Numa  ventur'd this contradiction upon the grossness of the people with whom he had to deal because the Truth and Fiction were equally necessary to his Ecclesiastical Policy For as his Authority was grounded upon the Fiction so it was strengthen'd by the Truth for the appearing of the Immortal Powers to  Numa  had not made him so venerable if such Apparitions had been common to  every one However this contradiction was swallowed by the People and  Numa  upon it gain'd both his Points for he was held to be a Sacred Person and the Gods were esteem'd invisible So that for a hundred and sixty years says  Plutarch  in the Life of  Numa  there was no such thing as a Statue in their Temples nor any talk of the Gods appearing to them For how could those numerous Gods whom they worshipp'd with any possibility appear to them since they could make no likeness of them At length the Superstition of the  Grecian  Idolatry by degrees encreas'd upon them and having conquer'd  Greece  and  Carthage  and so got an insight into the Arts and leisure at once to cultivate them the  Grecian  Religion and the  Grecian  Arts grew up together among them and of all the Arts Poetry was the first that was cultivated because it was incorporated with their Religion So that thereappears to me to be this considerable difference between the greater Poetry of the  Grecians  and that which was among the  Romans  that the  Grecians  deriv'd their Poetick Enthusiasm from the Miracles of their Religion  and the  Romans  borrow'd theirs in some measure from the  Grecians  Spiritum Graiae tenuem Camenae  Parca non mendax dedit c  Hor lib Ode  So that the latter appears to me to be but a Copy as it were of the former For in effect the  Romans  copied the  Grecian  Spirit For we have shown from  Horace  the best of the  Roman  Criticks that the  Romans  had no such thing among them till they had conquer'd  Greece  nor had they any such frequent Impulses to Enthusiasm and having the same Revelation at the time that they cultivated Poetry that the  Grecians  had they could hardly say any thing of their Gods or their DemiGods or their Fabulous Transformations that the  Grecian  Poets had not said before them Besides the most famous of the  Roman  Poets copied particular  Grecian  Authors as  Horace  did  Pindar  and consequently fell short of them in the freeness and flame of their Spirit as Copies must necessarily do of Originals And as for the Tragedies that were among the  Romans    the best of them were directly translated from the  Athenian  Poets  Since then the  Roman  Poets copied the  Grecian  Spirit what is the reason that the  Romans  copied them so much better than we do Why first they understood them better and were more familiar with them because then the  Grecian  was a living language and  Rome  had a continual correspondence with  Athens  Secondly they had a more beautiful and more harmonious language to receive that Spirit and lastly and chiefly that Religion from which it was deriv'd made greater impressions upon them than it does upon us And in order to the making that appear we shall show that Poetry among the  Romans  flourish'd and fail'd with Religion  Poetry began to be cultivated at  Rome  after the Conquest of  Greece  and the end of the Thid  Punick  War  Serus enim Graecis admovit acumina chartis  Et post punica belli quietus quaerere cepit  Quid Sophocles Thespis Aeschylus aetile ferrent  Now nothing is more reasonable than to believe that the  Grecian  Superstition from which the Spirit of their Poetry was deriv'd was at a greater height at  Rome  after the  Romans  had conquer'd the  Grecians  than it could be before they had a continual correspondence with that people But besides Religion in the main may be thought to be in a very great esteem among the  Romans  about the time that they began to cultivate Poetry  In order to the proving which let us enquire what was the fountain and source of Religion among the  Romans  and upon what it chiefly depended The chief support of Religion among the  Grecians  was the constant Revelation by Oracles but the  Italian  Oracles were more rare and of much less renown The prop and support of the  Roman  Superstition lay in their Divinations as  Machiavel  in his Discourses observes For says  Machiavel  they easily believ'd that that Divinity that foretold their felicity had the power to effect it  Machiavel  had reason to be of that opinion For how could their Gods be thought certainly to foretell what it was  not in their power certainly to effect And thus did the  Roman  Worship depend in a very peculiar manner upon the credit of their Divinations But now let us enquire in what credit the Divinations were when Poetry began to be cultivated which as we observ'd above was after the third  Punick  War  Now the credit of the Augurs and the Aruspices must needs at that time be very great with the  Romans  For since good Fortune alone inclines men to Devotion and to confide in the Gods as  Aristotle  has observ'd in the Second Book of his Rhetorick what thoughts must not the  Romans  have of their Soothsaying when they were not only arriv'd at such a Degree of Felicity but believ'd that they ow'd all their greatness to the predictions of their Augurs For they consulted them upon every important conjuncture and particularly before they gave Battel 'Tis true they had sometimes fail'd but where they had fail'd once they had succeeded ten times which is evident from the felicity of that Commonwealth Now if one lucky guess can support our ordinary Fortunetellers who are wretched contemptible  bonds against a hundred that happen unfortunate as we know by experience it does in what height of Reputation must not the Soothsayers be whose Order it self was held to be Sacred and August when they had apparently succeeded ten times for their failing once The  Romans  were now become the greatest people upon the Earth and the Promise of  Romulus  reveal'd to  Proculus  according to the Oath of the latter that  Rome  should be the Mistress of Nations that promise which at first seem'd so very incredible was now very likely to be accomplish'd And the  Romans  believ'd that they had been conducted by the predictions of those Diviners as it were by so many steps to that height of Glory at which they were in Triumph arriv'd and from the which they had a certain prospect of becoming Mastersof the Universe  Divination then being in very great credit in the age in which Poetry began to be cultivated Religion which had its chief dependance upon it must consequently needs be in very great credit too which was the thing that we design'd to prove  But from what has been said it necessarily follows that any one that should have brought Divination into disgrace must have given a terrible shock to the superstition of the  Romans  Now about a hundred and threescore years after Poetry began to be cultivated being introduc'd by  Livius Andronicus  there flourish'd a great Wit who not only baffled the whole Mystery of Divination in a learned Philosophical Treatise but also publish'd an extraordinary Book concerning the Nature of the Gods which alone says Mr  Harrington  in his preliminaries to his  Oceana  was sufficient to overthrow the Religion of the  Roman  State Thus  Cicero  contriv'd and effected himself the very Crime for which he declaim'd against  Cataline  with so much vehemence and undermin'd the most solid foundations of the Temples of the  Roman  Gods  About the same time the  Athenian  Philosophers began to establish themselves at  Rome  The  Jews  whose Country  Pompey  had subdu'd began every day to resort more and more to the World's Capitol The  Romans  thro an excess of ridiculous flattery deify'd their deceas'd  Emperors which alone was enough to make the  Roman  Religion ridiculous and Jesus Christ came into the world to introduce a new Revelation What was the effect of all this upon the  Roman  Religion A Superstition that had made such impressions on the minds of that people and from which they imagin'd that they and their Ancestors had receiv'd so much benefit could not be utterly overthrown in a moment The  Romans  were so very pertinacious in their Principles and had so much flegm and constancy in their constitutions that the  Grecian  Philosophy and the Doctrine of  Cicero  requir'd some time to prevail However prevail they did and with them the Christian Religion got ground and the Pagan declin'd and the Superstition and Poetry of the  Romans  gradually declin'd together And the Declension of the  Roman  Poetry was attributed even by  Petronius  himself who was a thoroughpac'd Epicurean to the neglect of the old Theology  Per Ambages Deorumque Ministeria  Precipitandus est liber Spiritus  CHAP XV Objections answer'd Conclusion of the former part of the Work  But here it concerns us to answer some Objections which we easily foresee may be made For if the Religion which the  Romans  borrow'd from the  Greeks  had so great an influence on their Poetry and the two Treatises which  Cicero  writ concerning Divination and the Nature of the Gods gave such a shock to that Superstition How comes it to pass that Poetry not only flourish'd afterwards but came to perfection in  Horace  and  Virgil  which two were the greatest of the  Roman  Poets In answer to which we shall endeavour to show as succinctly as we can why Poetry flourish'd after the publication of those Treatises and why it afterwards came to perfection To satisfie the Reader why Poetry flourish'd afterwards we need only repeat what we observ'd  above that the flegm and solidity of the  Roman  people and perhaps their Politicks suspended the effect of those Writings and of the Doctrine of the  Grecian  Philosophers and when they began to spread it is reasonable to believe that they went downwards from the  Patricians  and the  Roman  Knights to the people who in all probability were the last who were undeceiv'd Now the greatest of their Poets and especially  Virgil  and  Horace  flourish'd within less than fifty years after the publication of those Treaties and were most of them very meanly descended So that they were brought up in the Religion of their Country and had consequently when they came to write the advantage of first Impressions and their copying the  Grecian  Poetry threw them upon the old Idea's 'Tis true some few of them were better descended and were  Roman  Knights but either they were too much Men of Pleasure to dive into Philosophy or too much Poets to espouse a Sect that would not favour Enthusiasm  But now let us enquire with the same brevity for what reason Poetry that derives  its preheminence from Religion came to perfection among the  Romans  after these attacks had been given to the Religion of that State In answer to which we must put the Reader in mind that there are three things which contribute to the perfection of Poetry The first is Nature which is the foundation and basis of all For Nature is the same thing with Genius and Genius and Passion are all one For Passion in a Poem is Genius and the power of exciting Passion is Genius in a Poet to the raising of which Religion as we have shewn above gives a very great Advantage The second thing is Art by which I mean those Rules and that Method which capacitate us to manage every thing with the utmost dexterity that may contribute to the Raising of Passion The third thing is the Instrument by which the Poet makes his Imitation or the Language in which he writes By Language I do not mean here the expression of any particular Poem or the poetical Dialect which the Poet models himself but the language of the Country in which he writes and which he finds made to his  hands These are the three things that contribute to the perfection of Poetry so that in any Age or Country at whatever juncture Religion and Language and Poetical Art are in greatest force together at that very juncture the Poetry of that Country is at its heighth And this is the reason why Tragedy which is a Poem of the growth of  Attica  was at its height in the time of  Sophocles  because then the Language was in perfection the Art of Poetry and particularly of Tragedy had been extremely cultivated and Religion as yet had power enough o're the minds of men to inforce the passions But the greatest of these three is Religion and the most prevalent towards the advancement of Poetry as is plainly seen by the event For after that the Introduction of Moral Philosophy had ruin'd the establish'd Religion among the  Grecians  Tragedy immediately lost its force tho the language remain'd in perfection afterwards and the Poetick Art was perhaps improv'd Let us now examine how the Art of Poetry and the  Roman  Language and the  Roman  Religion stood in the time of  Augustus  The Art of  Poetry which had been introduc'd by  Livius Andronicus  had now been cultivated for about two hundred years but with a great deal of Interruption caus'd by the violences of those times and that it was at its utmost height in the time of  Augustus  we have no great reason to doubt because we find more of the Poetical Art in the single  Aeneis  of  Virgil  than in all the rest of the  Roman  Poets together For the Language that it was then at its height is agreed on by most and tho some few may contend that it was somewhat declin'd from the purity which it had in the preceding age yet it was certainly more Poetical in the time of  Augustus  that is more full more sounding more significant and more harmonious And as for Religion we have already shewn that the effect of the Writings of  Cicero  was suspended by the flegmatick temper which was incapable of sudden Impressions and perhaps by the politicks of the  Romans  But that was not all Religion had then more Force more Authority and more Majesty than it had had for some time before and that by the example of the Emperor No one can be  ignorant what influence the example of a Prince has upon the minds of the people Now  Augustus  was in his temper Religious even to Superstition And tho during the violences of the Triumvirate his Politicks had got the better of Nature in him yet assoon as he had attain'd the Soveraign Power Policy and Nature were reconcil'd and both of them favour'd Religion whereas the Age preceding had been an Age of continual Violences and consequently not of so much Religion The  Roman  Senate having got the Lands from the People had consequently got the Dominion so that that famous Commonwealth was dwindled into an Oligarchy and that Oligarchy was grown factious as all Oligarchies must of necessity do and the heads of those Factions were all of them labouring who should overthrow the State so that they who were at the Helm of the State neither were nor could appear good because there was a necessity of their giving pernicious Examples  Augustus  himself notwithstanding his natural clemency and his proneness to Superstition was drawn in by Ambition to the committing all manner  of violences in the beginning of the Triumvirate and neither did nor durst appear what he was till dividing the World between himself and  Anthony  Policy and Nature were reconcil'd in him and he was oblig'd to appear rather more Debonaire and Religious than he was by his Natural Temper that the Extravagancies of  Anthony  appearing more hideous compar'd with the Beauty of his Character he might insensibly undermine his Rival in the esteem of the Senate and the  Roman  people and alone command the Universe and we may judge by this what influence the Example of the Emperor had upon the Writers that it not only prevail'd upon  Virgil  to make Piety one of the chief Ingredients in the Character of his Hero who was design'd by the Poet the very Picture of  Augustus Caesar  but engag'd him to incorporate so much Religion with the Action of his Poem that it is the most Religious Epick Poem that ever was writ in the World  And thus we have endeavour'd to shew as briefly as we could that Art and Language and Religion were all of them in a great deal of force together in the glorious  Reign of  Augustus  and much more powerfully united than ever they had been before and I hope I need not tell the Reader than ever they were in the Reigns of succeeding Emperors And in shewing that I have given the reasons why the  Roman  Poetry was then at its utmost height tho I make no doubt but that a settled calm and a full tranquility after a fierce and a tedious Tempest and the elevation that might spring from the Remains and the Appearances of Liberty and consequently the appearances of their being Masters of the Universe and lastly the never to be forgotten bounty of a magnanimous Prince and the Emulation that must ensue upon it among so many extraordinary men might all of them contribute to the advancement of Poetry  But if the Writings that flourish'd aamong the  Romans  and especially in the time of  Augustus  receiv'd such advantage from the  Roman  Religion that the excellence and greatness of their Poetry is chiefly owing to that how comes it that  Virgil  is found in his Writings to have had so exalted a notion of God as is utterly inconsistent with the  Grecian  Theology How comes it to pass that  Lucretius  and  Horace  are held to be thoroughpac'd  Epicureans  on whom the Superstition that reign'd among their Countrymen could have no manner of influence and yet  Horace  allow'd to be after  Virgil  the greatest of the  Roman  Poets and  Lucretius  as  Tasso  is pleas'd to call him a most Noble Versifyer  'Tis true indeed  Virgil  had an exalted notion of God as we may see by several places in his works  Ab Jove principium Musae Jovis omnia plena  And that famour passage in the fourth  Georgick    Deum namque Ire per omnes  Terrasque Tractusque Maris Coelumque profundum  And that in the sixth  Aeneid    Principio Coelum ac Terras camposque liquentes  Lucentemque Globum Lunae Titannia{que} astra  Spiritus Intus alit totos{que} infusa per Artus  Mens agitat molem magna se corpore miscet  Now this exalted notion of  Jupiter  or the Supreme Being  Virgil  had from the Writings of  Plato  and the rest of the Gods and Goddesses a little modifyed as they are in that Poet in whom we wee see none of  Homer  's Religious extravagancies are exactly the  Platonick  Daemons So that  Virgil  strictly adhering to the  Platonick  Sect it follows that his Philosophy did very little harm to his Religion  But to proceed to  Horace  He was so very far from being a thoroughpac'd  Epicurean  as some will obstinately have him that he was of every Sect by turns and chang'd his Philosophy and his Religion with his Humour as a great many do besides him and when that Humour inclin'd him to Libertinism then he was an  Epicurean  and whenever it turn'd about to Austerity then he became a  Stoick  That there are a great many such persons in the world we may take the word of the Duke  De la Rochefant  Nous ne nous apercevons que des Emportmens et Des mouvmens extraordinares De nos Humeurs et de notre Temperament comme De la violence De la colere mais personne quasi ne s' apercoitque ces Humeurs ont un cours ordinaire et Regle qui ment et tourne Doucement et imperceptiblement notre volonte a des actions differentes elles roulent ensemble s'il faut ainsi Dire et exercent successivement un Empire secret en nous memes De sorts qu'elles ont un part considerable en toutes nos actions sans que nous le puissions reconnoitre  That is  We are sensible of nothing that passes within us but the extravagant extraordinary motions of our Complexions and Humours But hardly a man has made this discovery that those Humours have a constant regular Course which moves and insensibly inclines our wills to a great many different actions They run rowling together if I may use the expression and exercise a secret sway within us so that they have a considerable share in our actions while we are utterly unable to discern it  Now that  Horace  was as likely to be byass'd by his humour as any other person whatsoever we have his own word  Epist    lib    Si quaeret quid agam dic multa pulchra minantem  Vivere nec recte nec suaviter haud quia grando  Contuderit vites oleam{que} momorderit aestus  Nec quia longinquis armentum aegrotet in arvis  Sed quia mente minus validus quam corpore toto  Nil audire velim nil discere quod level aegrum  Fidis offendar medicis irascar amicis  Cur me funesto properent arcere veterno  Quae nocuere sequar fugiam quae perfore credam  Romae Tybur amem ventosus Tibure Romam  So that as we observ'd above when this humour inclin'd him to Libertinism then he was an  Epicurean  and when the alteration of that humour enclin'd him to severity then he became a  Stoick  or a  Platonick  of which we have a notorious instance in the th Ode of the first Book  Parcus Deorum Cultor infrequens c  'Tis true Monsieur  Dacier  treats this as Raillery but it must be fine Raillery that could never be found out to be Raillery till above sixteen hundred years after it was writ  Horace  has left enough behind him to shew that he understood Raillery a great deal better than that comes to But what will he say then to that remarkable passage of the first Epistle of the first Book  Ac ne forte roges quo me duce quo lare tuter  Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri  Quo me cunque rapit tempestas deferor hospes  Nunc agilis fio versor civilibus undis▪  Virtutis verae custos rigidus{que} satelles  Nunc in Aristippi furtim praecepta relabor  But tho we should grant that  Horace  was always an  Epicurean  yet that would make rather for than against us For it  is certain that he was educated in the Religion of his Country as we observ'd above and we know that the force of first impressions is great and the copying the Spirit of the  Grecian  Poetry threw him upon those first Ideas  Spiritum Graiae Tenuem Cimenae  Parca non mendax dedit  And then this very  Horace  whom some of the Moderns will so obstinately maintain to be a constant  Epicurean  this very person who as he was the second of the  Roman  Poets was one of their greatest Criticks declares himself absolutely of our opinion  viz  that the  Roman  Poetry deriv'd its preheminence from the  Roman  Religion for in his Satyrs wherein he assures us he is no Poet he intermingles none but Burlesque Religion and that very rarely with his Verses in his Odes where he knew that he was a Poet Religion is every where seen and Invocations Apostrophes Machines and Revelations abound in them  But now a word or two to  Lucretius  He writ before the publication of  Cicero  's  Treatises but then he was undeniably an  Epicurean  and writ with a design to draw others over to his Sect But in that very Poem which he writ with a Design to overthrow Religion he shews of what importance Religion was to Poetry and the very Treatise which he begins with a Design to overturn the Worship of the Gods that very Treatise he begins with the Invocation of a Goddess And that Invocation is undeniably one of the noblest and most Poetical parts of his Book So that  Lucretius  to attain an excellence in Poetry was contented to be guilty of a very strange absurdity in Philosophy For to what purpose does he Invoke the Goddess of Love Why he Invokes her to inform him that he ought not to Invoke her for that she does not hear him and does not regard him and has nothing at all to do with him  Omnis enim Divum per se natura a necesse est  Immortali aeuo summa cum pace fruatur  Semota a nostris Rebus sejunta{que} longe  For let no one tell me here that by  Venus  the Poet means only the generative  Faculty of things In short  Lucretius  Invokes something and Invocation is Adoration and whatever is ador'd must during the action by the Adorer be esteem'd a Deity  But it is not only in his Invocation that  Lucretius  is pleas'd to have recourse to Religion For after that in the two first Books he has been taking a great deal of pains to destroy the belief of Gods and Providence that in his third he may be very Poetical and very Sublime he is forc'd to erect a new Divinity in the room of those whom he has been just subverting And that is Nature tho by what he makes her say in that Noble  Prosopopaeia  we might very well mistake her for Providence  So that we have not only the opinion of  Lucretius  on our side but the example too For by having recourse to Religion in that very Philosophy that utterly disclaims it he not only declares of what Importance he thinks it to be to Poetry but has shewn of what Importance it really is by succeeding so much better in those passages than in the other parts of his Book But how could a Materialist the Reader may say draw  any advantage from Religion But  Lucretius  was made not born a Materialist He was bred in the Religion of his Country and so had the advantage of first impressions which are never to be defac'd  Lucretius  you may say perhaps was very lofty and very Poetical where he had nothing to do with Religion Indeed sometimes he was so for I do not remember that I affirmed that there can be no Poetry without Religion but only that Religion gives the occasion for the best the greatest and the most Exalted and it makes for my purpose sufficiently that  Lucretius  is most Poetical and and Sublime where he is Religious But where he is lofty in other places we find him describing the great  Phaenomena  of Nature and the higher a man rises and the nearer he comes to the first infinite cause the nearer he certainly comes to Religion Besides where  Lucretius  is lofty and Poetical in Describing the great  Phaenomena  of of Nature there we are sure to find him astonish'd for from whence comes his vehemence but from his astonishment which may give us a Suspicion that  Lucretius  was not so very assured of the  truth of his opinion For effects astonish no man He who is astonish'd is moved by the secret causes of things which are two high or too deep for his comprehension So that in places where there is no mention of Religion  Lucretius  in some measure derives from that his Impetuous Golden Torrent of Verse his vehemence and his Sublimity  And thus I have inquired into the merits of the Ancients with all imaginable Impartiality and have attempted to shew that they had the advantage of the Moderns in the greatness of Poetry but that they deriv'd it not from any Superiority of Faculties or any external or internal advantage abstracted from the nature of the subjects of which they treated but only from incorporating Poetry with Religion  The End of the first Part  THE ADVANCEMENT AND REFORMATION OF Modern Poetry  PART II  CHAP I That the Design of the True Religion and Poetry are the same  IN the former part of this Treatise we attempted to shew that the Ancient  Grecians  and  Romans  excell'd the Moderns in the greatness of Poetry and  so endeavour'd to oblige a very considerable party of Mankind who admire the Ancient Poets to that degree that they despair of their being ever equall'd much less surpass'd by the Moderns but then that we might disoblige as little as we could another body of men who have a high opinion of the Moderns and are apt to think them upon an equal foot with the Ancients we endeavour'd to prove that the Ancients deriv'd their preheminence not so much from any real superiority that they had in themselves as from the Subjects of which they treated which Subjects were Sacred either in their own nature or by their manner of handling them So that we have taken the most effectual course that we could possibly do to remove the despair of  party without too much exalting them▪ and to check the unreasonable presumption of the other without too much depressing them that so the one party might despond no more and the other be secure and careless no longer but tha  the Passions and Prejudices being removed which have hitherto obstructed the Advancement of a Noble Art and  both Parties being reconcil'd and united in the common opinion that the Ancients tho they are exalted above us are not beyond our reach may immediately take fire and contending with a Noble Emulation push on the Art to some degrees of perfection beyond what it has attain'd for these last fifteen hundred years For in the remaining part of this Treatise we shall make it our business to convince the Reader with all the brevity that the Importance of the affair will admit of that the Moderns by joyning Poetry with the true Religion will have much the advantage of the Ancients in the main tho they may fall short of them in some particular Poems  But here it concerns us to answer an Objection For perhaps the Reader may say how can you maintain that the Christian Religion will be such a help to Poetry when you have already in a former Treatise made use of the Authority of  Boileau  to shew that Christianity and Poetry were things that were inconsistent  De la Foy D'un Chretien les Mysteres terribles  D' ornemens Egayez ne sont point susceptibles  L' Evangele al Espritn offre De tous cotez  Que Penetence e faire ou tourmens meritez  Et de vos fictions le Melange Coupable  Meme a ses verites donne l'air de la fable  That is  The terrible Mysteries of the Christian Faith are not capable of delightful Ornaments that the Gospel offers nothing to our view but Repentance on the one side and Eternal Torments on the other and that the Criminal mixture of Poetical Fictions gave a fabulous air even to its most Sacred Truths  To which we answer that we only made use of this passage in the foremention'd Treatise to shew that the Mysteries of the Christian Religion were not to be mix'd with Fiction and consequently that it would be a hard matter to contrive  Machines  for an Epick Poem upon a Modern Christian subject  and if  Boileau  means any thing more by the foremention'd passage I shall endeavour to show that he is mistaken and that there may not only be most exalted Poetry upon a Christian subject without Machines and without Fiction but that the true Religion is more favourable to Poetry than Paganism or Philosophy or Deism and I shall first enquire into the Reason of things and afterwards see how it is supported by Matter of Fact  First I shall enquire into the Reason of the thing and I make no doubt but to make it appear that the nearer Poetry comes to Perfection the more agreeable it is to the design of the true Religion and that consequently Poetry is much more noble and more instructive and more beneficial to Mankind than either History or Philosophy  In order to the doing which let us examine what the design is of the true Religion and we shall find that not only the design of Poetry is the very same but the very methods of attaining that design the same as far as they can be humanely prosecuted tho at the same time it must be confest that Poetry tho  the noblest of all Arts and preferable either to History or Philosophy falls as short of the Excellence of the true Religion as Human Invention does of Divine Wisdom  The design of every Religion must be the Happiness of those who embrace it Impostors and all who set up new Religions for some politick ends must always pretend this or they will have no followers for all men propound Happiness to themselves in every thing that they do and the Reason why so few men are throughly and entirely of any Religion is because they are not sufficiently convinc'd that it will make them happy But as even false Religions must pretend to make those who profess them happy so the true one must really effect it For the true Religion whether it is innate or reveal'd must certainly come from God and must be given by him as a Rule and a Law for those who embrace it to walk by Now all Laws that are made by good Lawgivers are made for the Happiness of those who embrace them But God must be good and consequently cannot make Laws only because it is  his Arbitrary will no he must make them because he who best knows the nature of his own Creatures knows that they will find their Happiness in being conformable to them But if the design of all Religion must be to make men happy why then that must be the true Religion that makes men the most happy And consequently that must be the true Religion that has the Simplest Design and the shortest and the surest For the design of the true Religion being to make men happy it must necessarily be of such a nature as that all may be capable of it For if a Religion of which none but men of sense were capable should be the true Religion it would follow that God had made most men Blockheads and afterwards made them wretched for being so But now let us examine what Religion that is that takes the shortest and the surest and most admirable method for making those who embrace it happy  Since the design of all Religion must be to make men happy and the only true Religion can effect that design which all others in vain pretend to because  only the true Religion can come from God who alone understands our natures and alone knows that which the most will please us it follows that all who are not really of the true Religion cannot be perfectly happy Now this is certain that Mankind has in all Countries and in all Ages in all Places and at all Times complain'd of the want of Happiness Both Ancients and Moderns Philosophers and the People have agreed that Man was miserable And this universal consent may be sufficient to shew that the misery of Man is real and not imaginary besides they have all both Ancients and Moderns Philosophers and Poets Men of Sense and the Vulgar admirably agreed in describing it They have all consented in this that the misery of Man proceeded from a perpetual conflict that is within him and from a discord continually reigning among the faculties of the Soul a cruel War between the Passion and Senses and the Reason while the Reason violently draws one way and the Passions and the Senses another the latter endeavouring still to be pleas'd by getting the upper hand of the former  and the former contending to be satisfied by subduing the latter while neither party can gain an entire victory but an eternal conflict remains for tho the frequent advantages are on the side of the Passions yet Reason rallies from time to time and maintains a running fight  Video Meliora probo{que}  Deteriora sequor  Says  Medea  in  Ovid  And says  Horace  th Epistle of the first Book  Dic multa pulchra minantem  Vivere nec recte nec suaviter haud quia grando  Contuderit vites oleamque momorderit aestus  Nec quia longisquis armentum aegrotet in arvis  Sed quia mente minus validus quam corpore toto  Nil audire velim nil discere quod levet aegrum  Fidis offendar medicis irascar amicis  Cur me funesto properent arcere veterno  Quae nocuere sequar fugiam quae perfore credem  But St  Paul  who knew the cause of this misery of Mankind has given by much the most clear and lively Discription of it  Rom  ch ver  For that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that do I  If then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good  Now then it is no more I but sin that dwelleth in me  For I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not  For the good which I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do  Now if I do that I would not it is no more I but sin that dwelleth in me  I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me  For I delight in the law of God after the inward man  But I see another law in my members warring against the law in my mind  and bringing into captivity the law of sin which is in my members  O wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death  I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord so then with the mind I my self serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin  Thus has St  Paul  given a lively Description of the conflict that is in the Human Soul between Passion and Reason because he very well knew the cause of it The Philosophers felt the effect and could describe it tolerably well but being wholly ignorant of the cause they took that to be a Defect in Nature which is really an infectious Distemper and here lay the folly of those people in believing that they were capable of altering Nature which puts me in mind of an Astrological King of  Naples  who not being very well pleas'd with what he thought the System and Contrivance of the Universe said that if God when he made the World would have vouchsaf'd to have consulted him he could have given him very good advice For so by their Writings the Philosophers seem to have been of opinion  that whereas God had made Man Impious they could make him Good and whereas he had made him a Blockhead they could make him Wise  But the Philosophers not knowing the cause of the misery of Man made very successless attempts towards the making us happy for whether they supported the Reason against the Passions all that they gain'd was to inflame the contention which they design'd to extinguish and by rousing and exasperating the Parties make that War be carried on with vehemence which perhaps was in a languishing state before or whither they animated the Passions against the Reason they could only mortifie what they could never vanquish  Thus whither they endeavour'd to live up to the Dictates of Reason the Passions plagu'd them by a very violent resistance or whether they endeavour'd to plunge themselves in sensual pleasure they could no further oppress the Reason than they stupified the whole Man and Remorse at last like the Dragon that watch'd the  Hesperian  fruit was never to be laid asleep  But tho the Philosophers seem'd wholly in the dark the Poets appear'd to have a glimmering of the Truth as we may conclude from the Fable of  Pandora  and  Epimetheus  whether they had it from old Tradition or from a Noble Effort of Reason For says Mr  Mede  If there were no Scripture yet the unsampled Irregularity of our whole Nature which all the time of our life runs counter to all Order and Right Reason the woful misery of our condition being a scene of sorrow without any rest or contentment this might breed some general suspicion that  ab initio non fuit ita  but that he who made us Lords of his Creatures made us not so worthless and vile as now we are but that some common Father to us all had drank some strange and Devilish Poyson wherewith the whole Race was infected Thus far goes Mr  Mede  and I will make bold to add by the leave of the Clergy that this Suspicion might very well grow up to Reason and Certainty tho' there were no Scripture For that Man is miserable experience assures us but since Man is a Creature capable of  Happiness and one who knows his misery Reason may tell us that Man could never be Created miserable for that would have been contrary to the goodness of God which is his Darling Attribute Since God might as well Damn his Creatures for nothing as he might Create them miserable Man therefore was certainly created happy and happy had he continued till now if it had not been for his own fault because it had been repugnant to the Justice of God to punish Man for nothing Thus far we may conclude then by the force of Reason that Man has committed some horrible crime the which has made him miserable  But tho' the strength of Reason may reach thus far yet it could never inform Man of the Nature of the crime the committing of which has made him miserable nor in what his original Happiness consisted All that that we can guess by Reason is this that since the misery of Man at present lyes in the conflict that he has within himself and in the Civil War which is maintaind in his faculties that his original Happiness consisted in the Peace and Agreement  and the Harmony that was between them and that the Crime that caused his unhappiness was in all likelihood something that naturally and necessarily broke that Harmony and that Agreement And that we may see how far these conjectures agree with what our Religion says of it let us make some enquiry into the account which Sacred Writ has given of it  That tells us that man was not in the beginning what he is at present That he was created Holy Innocent Perfect That his Creator fill'd him with the brightness of Knowledge and with a luminous lively Intelligence That he then had a strict dependence on his Maker That he communicated the wonders of his Glory to him That the Eye of Man then saw the Majesty of God and that this Creature so miserable now was then most entirely happy That he was unclouded untroubled impained impassive immortal This is the account that our Religion gives us of the primitive state of Man It tells us how great his Knowledge was  his Happiness and his Perfection Let us now see how much his Passions and his Sences were able to contribute to so much Felicity  That Man in his Original State had Passions and great Passions is certain For without Passion there can be no Happiness because there can be no Pleasure Besides it must be by a great Passion or by great Passions that the first Man must fall For by the weakness of his Reason he could not be lost For if he had not had Reason enough to know that he ought not to have committed the transgression which ruin'd him why then the ruin of Man had not been his own fault Man therefore before the Fall had Passions but being in a state of Perfect Felicity he could consequently be subject to no Passions which were not entirely consistent with that He walked with God and was then united to him because the Creator was pleased to communicate himself in so great a degree to his Creature Man therefore constantly contemplated  God not so much by the force of Reason as of Intuition or a luminous lively Intelligence God acted upon his mind and he felt him as well as saw him and consequently Admir'd Lov'd Desir'd Ador'd him and the result of these charming Passions was a Joy unspeakable For the more they were exalted the more his Reason approv'd of them and since it knew that he could never suffer by them in that state of Happiness and of Immortality it eternally exhorted him to perpetuate them and told him that they could never be too high for their Glorious Object So that man in his primitive State was always in lofty ravishing Transports For Love Admiration Joy and Desire those charming Passions were all that he knew of which Blissful Love was always the chief For God making Man a sociable Creature gave him such a sort of a Happiness as that the Felicity of one might produce that of another and what could that be but an habitual Charity or loving God and Man for the sake of God Our blissful Sire enjoy'd  a sincere felicity and consequently could never know any trouble nor any passion that had a mixture of trouble as anger sorrow fear and the like Much less could Ambition find room in his breast with Envy Hatred Pride and Revenge and the rest of those Turbulent passions that are utterly inconsistent with Charity  And as his passions were always pleasing so his senses were never shock'd The happy creature converst with Angels and saw the Majesty of his Maker And for the Terrestrial Objects which were around him and which were all subjected to his universal Empire whenever he survey'd them like his Creator he found that they were always good and as the Creatures never were Disobedient he was never Displeas'd with them For as he had neither fear nor knowledge of suffering Antipathy Aversion Horrour and the like were things that he never knew which in this woful state of misery are so often Nature's secret Intelligencers to advise us of approaching harm Thus all the Faculties were always pleas'd and man was bless'd unspeakably  But the result of this perfect Harmony was not only continual Happiness but unclouded Knowledge and Immortality For as from the Agreement of the vital Faculties and their concording motions Spirit and Health and pleasant Ease and vigour of Sense proceeds so from the Harmony of the Rational and Animal powers proceeded a luminous lively Intelligence and a blissful Immortality For pleasure was the result of that Agreement and since Death can only come by pain he who is in a state of perpetual pleasure must by consequence be Immortal  But Man alas was unable to support so much Happiness without Presumption He form'd the Design of growing Independant of shaking off the government of him who made him and finding his felicity apart from God This made him conceive the Horrible Crime of Diverting his affections from him who alone was worthy of them to things that were form'd so many degrees inferiour to him and that which made the unpardonable enormity of that crime was this that when God had created him with an ardent desire of Happiness  and had created him of such a nature that his full and his perfect Happiness lay in his strict dependance on him and had given him a clear understanding to know this that I say made the unpardonable enormity of his Crime that contrary to this Nature and this Desire and this unclouded Knowledge he revolted and fell off from God and by the suggestion of his greatest enemy tax'd him at once with folly and envy in believing himself capable of finding and enjoying a greater felicity than what his Maker design'd for him And thus Mans fatal Original Sin whether the business of the Tree of Knowledge is Literal or Allegorical consisted in his horribly diverting his affections from his God to the Creatures And thus the Harmony of his Intellectual and Animal powers was very miserably broke For Reason disapprov'd of the unworthy objects that Man had chosen for his Passions and the Passions being natural and congenial to the Soul could not be idle and Man could not reduce them to their primitive object For God had abandon'd him to himself and how should Man of himself approach Infinity  And now the blissful Time was no more when Man was only touch'd with transporting Passions And now the force of those Charming Passions was continually curb'd by Reason which utterly disapprov'd of their objects and a thousand vexatious ones sprung up among them like cockle to choak the vital seed and which were partly the result of present misery and partly of past felicity  Besides the Sences partook of the same Disorder that had seiz'd the Passions and they that during his state of Innocence were always pleas'd with the approbation of Reason and were ne're Disturb'd now either betray'd him to Concupiscence or were shock'd at their several objects His Eye and his Ear those noble ministers of the Understanding were no longer charm'd with the voice of God and the glorious presence of Angels and were either too much engag'd by the Terrestrial objects around them or disturb'd in despight of Reason The Creatures whom God had furnish'd with instinct sufficient for the care of their preservation in their Degenerate Monarch beheld  their Enemy They gladly obey'd him during his Innocence as Loyal Subjects do a good King but when he grew wicked he grew a Tyrant and they at the same time turn'd Rebels From hence Aversions Horrors Antipathies and Fear and Hate and Rage sprung up in them and Man was got into a state of War with all the inferiour Creatures who of his Humble Vassals before were now his Potent Enemies Both Parties were on their Guard incessantly always dreaded and always terrify'd  And thus the Harmony of the Intellectual and Animal powers was dissolv'd by Original Sin And the Ignorance of this caus'd all the blunders of the Philosophers They knew very well that the Combat between the Reason and Passions caus'd the misery of Man but they never dreamt of reconciling the difference because alas they never thought that the parties had once been friends All that they aim'd at was to put an end to the conflict by destroying one of the parties and so some of them thought of stifling the Reason and others of suppressing the Passions  But the folly of these two Designs was equally great because they are attempts at things that are equally Impossible For as long as Man is Man he must have Reason and as long as there is Reason there will be Remorse which will rally from time to time and be a check upon the exorbitance of the Passions And tho Remorse could be entirely extinguish'd as I believe it never can yet Reason would be sure to make its Declaration another way and that is by our inconstancy in pleasure and our want of variety  Nor is the folly less of endeavouring to suppress the Passions for either they must be wholly suppress'd or restrain'd But all the Passions being natural in the condition in which Man is now none of them can be wholly suppress'd without destroying the Man nor can some of them be so much as moderated without maintaining constantly in the soul a very violent conflict because they were perfectly unrestrain'd in their original Natures  The Passions are either natural and congeneal to the Soul or accidental These first are those which are pleasing  to it as Love Joy Desire and with these the first Man was created for Man was created Happy but without these Passions there can be no Happiness The accidental Passions as Anger Envy Indignation and Desire of Revenge are those with which Man at the first was not created for they all include Misery and he was created Happy They were all the result of the fall which brought woe to the Race of Men Man is indeed capable of restraining these last because they all of them include Misery and he retaining a vehement desire of Happiness tho joyn'd to an impotence of attaining it is by that very Desire capacitated to struggle with apparent Misery But it must needs be a hard contention when we pretend to moderate the first because there is something within us that secretly tells us they are necessary to our Happiness and the conflict must needs be violent when we strive against our own Happiness Besides they are as natural to the Soul as Reasoning and the result of that and a Reasonable Creature can no more be without Admiration Love and Desire than it can be without Thinking  or without the appetites of Sence and a Man can no more suppress the one by Philosophy than the other He can no more take away Love and Desire by Reasoning than he can satisfie Hunger and Thirst with a Syllogism All that he can arrive at is either to conceal those Passions as he may do his Appetites or to refuse to act in consequence of them as he may in consequence of Thinking or of Sensual Appetites Or lastly He may weaken these congeneal Passions by Mortification as he may do his Appetites or his Reason For a Distemper weakens the whole Man and Mortification is a Distemper in effect at least But when the man is in health and his Sences vigorous and his Reason piercing these Appetites too will be strong And the more powerful the Reason is the stronger will be the Passions And therefore the attempt to suppress these was folly in the Philosophers For these Passions are the pleasure of the Soul which cannot struggle with success against felicity The cause of their mistake was this Some of them as for example the  Stoicks  thought that Reason disapprov'd  of the Passions when she only dislik'd the Objects whereas the  Cyrenaicks  on the other hand thought that Humane Nature allow'd of the Objects when it did nothing but approve of the Passions  And this may serve to shew the folly of Deism as well as it may of Philosophy For Deism pretending like Philosophy to combat all the Passions must be founded on the strength of Reason But a Religion founded on the strength of Reason cannot be the true Religion For the true Religion must be sent from God for the Happiness of Mankind and of that Religion all must be capable as we have shown above But of a Religion founded on the strength of Reason and whose proofs must of consequence be deduc'd from a long train of consequences all men are not capable for every Religion must have proofs and all men are not capable of the proofs of such a Religion as that As for example before a man can be a Deist effectually he must be convinc'd of the being of a God by Reason and must be convinc'd by the same Reason that the World is govern'd  by God But to be capable of the proofs that Deism gives of those two points a man must either have a very strong Reason or a very good education whereas not so much as one in forty of Mankind has either But all are capable of the proofs of Revealed Religion For by proving the Divinity of the Revelation the Doctrine is proved in course Now the Divinity of the Revelation must be prov'd by Miracles But Miracles are proofs of which all men are capable because they speak to the Passions and appeal to the Sences Since therefore the true Religion must be design'd for all and all men are capable of the proofs of Reveal'd Religion whereas not one in forty is capable of the proofs of Deism it follows that a Religion that is not Reveal'd cannot be the True Religion  Besides no Religion can be the True Religion that is insufficient to answer the ends of Government But a Religion that is not design'd for all can never answer the ends of Government And therefore Deism cannot be the True Religion For there are but two things that can restrain mankind and keep  them within the power of Law Religion and sense enough to know their real Interest But we have already made it appear above that whoever wants good sense cannot be restrain'd by Deism  That Deism is insufficient to answer the ends of Government may be further plain from matter of fact for it would be an easie thing to convince the Reader that there never was any tolerable Government in the World without a Reveal'd Religion and that the Governments that have been most Renown'd upon Earth flourish'd with their respective Revelations and with them decay'd as the  Israelites  did with their Prophets the  Grecians  with their Oracles and the  Romans  with their Divinations so that either the True Religion can be in the World without order and without peace or Deism cannot possibly be the True Religion  Again either that can be the True Religion which can contribute nothing even to the Happiness of those who embrace it or Deism cannot be the True Religion For Deism contributes nothing at all to the Happiness even of  those who are capable of it because that by combating and resisting the Passions it maintains the War of the Faculties instead of appeasing it  Thus we have shewn that the Design of the True Religion must not only be to make men Happy but must effectually do it that the Philosophers indeed had that Design but blunder'd in the execution of it and by pretending either to set up our Passions above our Reason or our Reason above our Passions only maintain'd an eternal conflict in the breasts they design'd to ease that the Deist does the very same thing by his endeavours to exalt Reason by depressing the Passions Let us now shew how the Christian Religion exalts our Reason by exalting the Passions and by a plain and a short but a most admirable Design restores the Harmony of the Human Faculties and the Felicity of the first man  For after that Christianity has gain'd its professors by proving after the most plain and simple manner all that is necessary to be believ'd in it that is by Miracles attested by unexceptionable Witnesses it gains its end which is the  Happiness of its believers in so plain so sure and so short a way that the way to Happiness and the end is but one and the same thing and differs only in Degree  Set your affections on things above and not on things below  says the Apostle  Coloss  That is Do but earnestly desire of God to incline your affections to him their primitive object Do but desire it and he will incline them and the great business of Religion is done the Harmony of the Human Faculties restor'd and the Felicity of the first man in some measure at least renew'd Nay the way is shorter and plainer even than this For Do but earnestly desire of God to give you Charity and he will give it and with that give every Virtue For to shew how plain how short how admirable the Design is of this Divine Religion Love which is but a single Passion and the most pleasing of all the Passions comprehends all its Duties and all its Felicity St  Paul  has given an admirable reason why it comprehends all its Duties for Love says he worketh no ill to his Neighbour and is therefore the fulfilling of the  Law And that it is inclusive of all its Felicity may be concluded from hence that Charity gently restraining those tumultuous Passions which disturb and torment the mind exalts all the pleasing affections which are natural and congeneal to the Soul and exalts the very Reason of Mankind by exalting those charming Passions For Reason being troubled no more in its Functions by the painful conflict which it maintain'd before is free to discern and distinguish Divine Truth and now employs the exten and stretch of its power in confirming and augmenting the force of those aspiring Passions which while they were directed to mortal objects it esteem'd its mortal Enemies And as the Reason rouzes and excites the Passions the Passions as it were in a fiery vehicle transport the Reason above Mortality which mounting soars to the Heaven of Heavens upon the wings of those very affections that before repress'd the Noble Efforts that it made to ascend the Skies  And thus we have seen how the Christian Religion reconciles Passion to Reason And while the troublesome  Virtues of Deists and old Philosophers are employ'd in restraining those charming Passions which are so natural to the Soul of man and which rightly directed constitute all its Felicity the Cardinal Virtues of the true Religion as Faith and Hope and Charity are exalted Passions themselves And as Christianity confirms and cherishes all the pleasing affections which are to the Soul as so many delicious Friends and so many dear Relations the very conversation of which is sufficient to make it happy it gently appeases the tumultuous Passions accidental uneasy guests that interrupt its pleasure  But the Christian Religion restores the harmony of the Human Powers to a greater degree than this and provides even a pleasure of Sence that may be highly approv'd of by Reason For though the Christian in this life is not allowed to expect that in a Soveraign degree yet since there is no sight so charming to the Eye and no Musick so harmonious to the Ear as the voice and looks of those whom we love the Christian Religion by commanding us Epist of St  Pet  ch v  To love one  another with a pure heart fervently  has provided in an admirable manner for the delight of those noble Sences  Thus the proofs ofChristianity are short and plain and its Doctrine that leads to Felicity admirably short and unperplex'd whereas the proofs of Deism are abstruse I mean to the People they are abstruse and we have shewn that the true Religion must be designed for all and the method that it takes to make us happy tedious and vexatious And this is extreamly remarkable that the very morality which in Deism and in Philosophy is prov'd at the first perhaps with difficulty and perhaps at the last obscurely and when it is prov'd obey'd with pain because it shocks all the pleasing Passions which so firmly inhere to the Soul that very Morality in the Christian Religion is clearly and easily prov'd to all because the Divinity of its Revelation is clearly and easily prov'd and when it is prov'd is pursu'd with pleasure because it is every part of it dictated by Love the best and sweetest of all the Passions  And thus Christianity performs in a moment what Philosophy and Deism have for Ages in vain attempted For God can touch the Heart in a moment  and a short contrition makes way for a long felicity And the wisdom of God seems loudly to declare the simplicity of his great design by the persons whom he chose to execute it For had there been any thing perplex'd or difficult in it Men of Choice Education and great Parts would have been chosen to expound it But it was so easie so clear so agreeable to the Nature of Man whether consider'd as an Individual or a Member of a vast Society for Charity that makes the Happiness of particulars tends to the felicity of the whole community and whereas Justice is satisfied with the restraining men from the doing harm Charity the most active and the best natur'd of all virtues engages him to the doing good and there can be no such prevalent motive for the making any one happy as because we love him the design I say of this Holy Religion is so agreeable to the nature of man that God made choice of twelve poor Fishermen or something more vile to human regard than Fishermen to propagate its Divine Doctrine And to whom did they preach it Not to Brutal Savages as  Orpheus  did his pretended Revelation before them nor to bloody Barbarians as  Mahomet  did his Fanatick Enthusiasm afterwards but to the most civiliz'd and knowing Nations of the World when Learning was at the greatest heighth amongst them to the Provinces of the  Lesser Asia  who were the most subtle people on the Earth to  Greece  the great Inventress of Arts and to  Rome  the Mistress of Nations to  Rome  that with her victorious Armies had even then just then subdu'd and civiliz'd the barbarous World And twelve poor ignorant contemptible Fishermen who were dispis'd by their own Nation and whose Nation it self was almost universally despicable in a very short time establish'd this Doctrine in the midst of these knowing Nations nay and establish'd it without Arts without Eloquence without Reputation without Power and downright Innocence and Simplicity prevail'd o're the subtilty of the  Asiaticks  the vigorous lively penetration of the  Greeks  and the profound solidity of the  Romans  So that Knowledge blushing was instructed by Ignorance and the vain efforts of all human  Wisdom stood confounded by the foolishness of Preaching And the Apostle had a great deal of reason to exeult in the first Ep to the  Cor  v Where is the Wise Where is the  Scribe  Where is the Disputer of this World Hath not God made foolish the Wisdom of this World For after that by the Wisdom of God the World by Wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of Preaching to save them that believe and v the th  ibid  God hath chosen the foolish things of this World to confound the Wisdom of the Wise So that this Religion propagated under these strange disadvantages by Ignorance against Philosophy by Simplicity against Arts and Eloquence by Weakness against all the opposition of Power by abject and contemptible persons against the noise and renown of Wisdom by men under poverty and persecution against all the Flatteries of Imperial Tyrants this Divine Religion embraced with danger boasted of in sufferings and taught in Martyrdom this Religion I say thus wonderfully propagated must needs have had something in the design of it when it was but never  so little attended to that is extreamly agreeable to the Nature of Man and must be better adapted to make a Creature compounded of Passions and Reason Happy than either Power or Place or Worldly Prosperity or Fame or Philosophy were before But what could be so agreeable to the nature of a Creature compounded of the foresaid Faculties as that which reconciled those Faculties which neither Fame nor Philosophy Riches nor Power could ever be found to do or how could twelve poor wretched Fishermen without education without parts comprehend what the worlds great Sages could never find out or how could they consent against apparent interest in making it known to the world if they had not been instructed and compell'd to act by something that was more than Human  And thus we have shewn How that the Design of all Religion must be to make men Happy but that the True Religion must not only design it but must effectually do it And then we proceeded to shew that the misery of man consisting in the conflict which is maintain'd within him his Happiness  by consequence must proceed from the Harmony which is in the Human Faculties then we shew'd how that Harmony came to be broke and how it was afterwards by the Christian Religion restored  But now as the end of every Religion must be the happiness of those who embrace it so the design of every Art must be the very same as has been always acknowledged by all who have enquired into the Nature of Art in general or into the designs of particular Arts And as the true Religion must not only propound the Happiness of its Professors but must really effect it and as that alone is the true Religion which makes the best provision for the happiness of those who profess it so that must be the best and the noblest Art which brings the greatest Felicity with it But as the misery of man proceeds from the discord and those civil jars that are maintained within him it follows that nothing can make him happy but what can remove that discord and restore the Harmony of the Human Faculties So that that must be the best and the noblest Art which makes the best Provision at the  same time for the satisfaction of all the Faculties the Reason the Passions the Sences But none of them provides in such a Soveraign manner as Poetry for the satisfaction of the whole man together In some of them only Reason finds its account as in Logick and Mathematicks In some of them only Reason and Passion as in the Ancient Eloquence and that by no means in a Soveraign degree for sometimes the Passions oppress the Reason and sometimes Reason excludes the Passions In others the Passions and the Sences are charm'd while Reason finds little contentment in them Thus Musick by its Harmony raises the Passions at the same time that it pleases the Ear and Painting by its touches moves the affections at the same time that it charms the Eye But in a sublime and accomplish'd Poem the Reason and Passions and Sences are pleas'd at the same time superlatively The Reason in the soundness and importance of the Moral and the greatness and justness of an Harmonious design whose parts so beautiful when they are considered separately become transporting upon a view or the whole while we are never weary of  contemplating their exact proportion and beautiful symetry and their secret wonderful dependance while they are all animated by the same Spirit in order to the same end The reason further finds its account in the exact perpetual of Servance of Decorums and in beholding itself exalted by the exaltation of the Passions and in seeing those Passions in their fiercest transports confin'd to those bounds which that has severely prescrib'd them That the Passions must find their account in Poetry we have endeavour'd to prove in the former part of this Treatise but we cannot forbear taking notice of this that those very Passions which plague and torment us in life please us nay transport us in Poetry That the noble senses find their account in an accomplish'd Poem no one who has read one can a moment doubt Nor  Corelli  's Hand nor  Syphace  's voice could ever to a judicious ear equal the  Virgilian  Harmony Which has all the Mastery with all the Air and all the Sweetness with all the Force that the most delicate Ear can require Tho all his Numbers are always perfect yet he never dwells upon any and  they which are in themselves so pleasing delight us the more because we are immediately forc'd to leave them for the perfection of some different Harmony Nor is the Eye less satisfied than the Ear For an Admirable Poet always Paints and all his Pictures are always Beautiful Let the real objects be never so odious let them be never so dreadful yet he is sure to paint them Delightful For tho sometimes a vigorous lively Imitation of Creatures that are in their natures noxious may be capable of giving us Terror yet Nature by giving us a secret Intelligence that the object is not real can turn even that Tormenting Passion to pleasure  Thus Poetry by restoring the Harmony of the Human Faculties provides for the Happiness of Mankind better than any other Human Invention whatever And 'tis for this reason that it has always been so highly esteem'd by the greatest of men They who have arriv'd at the being Masters of the Universe have afterwards entertain'd the Ambition of becoming Poets and after they have acquir'd a great deal of Fame by making whole Nations miserable  have aspir'd to the more charming glory of making mankind happy 'Tis for this very reason that this Delicious Art has had as many Confessors if I may be allow'd to call them so almost as Religion it self 'Tis for this very reason that so many have been willing to renounce all worldly greatness for it and pleasure which attends on power and have been contented to live poor and miserable pitied by the wise and contemn'd by fools persecuted by fortune and hated by one another  For no man leaves pleasure but for greater pleasure and he who forsakes all the world for Poetry must find a Happiness in that which all the world could not supply him with Poetry seems to be a noble attempt of Nature by which it endeavours to exalt it self to its happy primitive state and he who is entertain'd with an accomplish'd Poem is for a time at least restor'd to Paradice That happy man converses boldly with Immortal Beings Transported he beholds the Gods ascending and descending and every Passion in its turn is charm'd while that his Reason is supreamly satisfied Perpetual Harmony attends his  Ear his Eye perpetual Pleasure Ten thousand different objects he surveys and the most dreadful please him Tygers and Lyons he beholds like the first Man with joy because like him he sees them without danger But nothing that is meerly Human can be on all sides perfect The Delight which Poetry gives is neither perpetual nor are all men capable of it Religion alone can provide man a pleasure that is lasting as it may be universal Poetical fire neither always burns in us nor can it always warm us but Charity like the sacred flame that was the guardian of the  Roman  Empire if 'tis with care maintain'd like that becomes like that eternal  But now since the design of Poetry and the very method of prosecuting that design as far as it can be humanly prosecuted is the same with that of the True Religion since the very thing that they both propose is to exalt the Reason by exalting the Passions and so make Happy the whole Man by making Internal Discord cease I appeal to any one whether Poetry must not agree better with that Religion whose Designs are the very same with it than with Paganism  or Philosophy or Deism whose Designs have been shewn repugnant to it In short when the Pagan Theology was brought nearer to the Christian Religion by the Philosophy of  Plato  as it was modelled by  Virgil  it became the fitter for Poetry For  Virgil  saw with an admirable judgment not only that the Reason must find its account in Poetry as well as the Passions and the Sences but that the Reason of Mankind in the time of  Augustus Caesar  when Moral Philosophy got ground every day in the World would not be satisfied at so easy a rate as it was when  Homer  writ or at least that it would not long be satisfied at so easy a rate which oblig'd him to model the  Grecian  Revelation by the Philosophy of  Plato  and that got  Virgil  the preheminence over  Homer  For since the design of every Art is to make men happy and that is the best and the noblest Art which makes the best provision for the happiness of Mankind and nothing can make man so happy as the reconciling him to himself which can be no way so effectually done as by making all the Faculties find  their satisfaction together it follows that that must be the noblest Poetry where the Reason the Passions and Sences are all of them pleas'd and pleas'd in the highest degree together And therefore tho we should be obliged to grant what some will pretend with so much obstinacy and which I can never believe that the Passions and the Sences find their account in  Homer  better than they do in  Virgil  yet since they find their account too in  Virgil  in a very great degree and Reason at the same time is satisfied whereas it is horribly shock'd in  Homer  by the extravagance of his Theology it follows that  Virgil  for that Reason is certainly to be preferred to  Homer  tho this is to be said in the behalf of the latter that he writ to the people of his own age in which the Reason of Mankind was satisfy'd at an easier rate  And therefore when I say that  Virgil  is to be preferr'd to  Homer  I mean that he is so in regard to us because he is capable of giving us a greater pleasure than  Homer  but I do not pretend at the same time that  Virgil  is capable of giving us a greater pleasure than  Homer  gave his Contemporaries As likewise when I affirm that the Moderns by joyning Poetry with the True Religion will have the Advantage of the Ancients I mean only in regard to us to whom they will give a greater pleasure than the Ancients can do but not a greater than the Ancients gave their Contemporaries In short if  Virgil  was forc'd to model his  Grecian  Revelation by  Platonism  that he might please more effectually even in his time when that Revelation as yet prevail'd I think we may very well conclude that in our time we ought to fling it out of our Poetry when it has been for so long time utterly exploded and contemn'd by the very Boys Thus the  Grecian  Religion and the Modern Poetry can agree but very indifferently because the Reason is shock'd by it And if Reason is shock'd by the Religion which is joyn'd with the Poetry by the Religion I say which gives the force to the Passions as we have shewn above I would fain know how the Passions can very well find their account I know indeed very well that a Poet by the force of a strong Imagination may enter into the  Grecian  Religion when he sets himself to write and transport himself to the Age and Scene of his Action and consequently may draw a great deal of advantage from the Religion of that Country and of that Age in order to the being mov'd and if the Poet is extremely mov'd himself why they who read him must be mov'd in some measure too but whether the generality of Readers can be so very much mov'd as if the Passions deriv'd their Force from a Religion that is more familiar to them I have a great deal of reason to doubt But if Reason cannot find its account in the  Grecian  Religion joyn'd with the Modern Poetry much less would the Passions find their satisfaction in Deism or the Ancient Philosophy The Christian Religion alone can supply a Poet with all that is Sublime and Majestick in Reason all that is either soft or powerful either engaging or Imperious in the Passions and with all the objects that are most admirable to the sences and consequently most delightful as shall be shewn at large in the following Chapter  CHAP II  WE shew'd in the former part of this Treatise that the Ancients excell'd the Moderns in the greatness of Poetry because they incorporated Poetry with Religion and we pretended to shew in this Second Part That by joyning Poetry with the true Religion the Moderns in the main will have the advantage of the Ancients In order to the proving which we shew'd in the first Chapter that the design of the Christian Religion was agreeable to that of Poetry whereas the Designs of Paganism and Deism and Philosophy were not agreeable to it We shew'd that the true Design of Poetry as well as of the Christian Religion was to please the Reason the Passions and the Sences at the same time For we shew'd in the former part of this Treatise that Passion whether ordinary or Enthusiastick is the principal thing in Poetry and nothing is more certain than that the more  the Sences are stirr'd and the more the Reason at the same time is satisfied the more strongly for the most part the Passions of Reasonable creatures are mov'd  Now in this Chapter we pretend to shew that the true Divine Poetry has the advantage of the Pagan Poetry that it satisfies the Reason more at the same time that it raises a stronger Passion and that it entertains the Sences and especially the Eye more delightfully and we pretend to give undeniable instances of it both from Sacred Writ and from one of the Fathers and from one of our own Poets  There is certainly to subject so great as the power of God and both  Homer  and  Virgil  have handled it to admiration The latter says of  Jupiter  who presided at the Council of the Gods in the Tenth Book  Tum pater omnipotens rerum cui prima potestas  Infit eo dicente deum domus alta silescit  Et tremefacta solo tellus silet arduus aether  Tum Zephyri posuere premit placida aequora pontus  And thus Mr  Dryden  has made it  English  Then thus to both reply'd th' Imperial God  Who shakes Heav'ns axels with his awful Nod  When he begins the silent Senate stand  With Reverence list'ning to the dread Command  The Clouds dispell the Winds their Breath restrain  And the hush'd Waves lie flatted on the Main  But  Virgil  has handled this subject still after a greater manner in the first of the  Georgicks  And that the Reader may have all the force of it set before his Eyes we shall show him how 'tis prepared and begin a little before it▪  Saepe ego cum flavis messorem induceret arvis  Agricola fragili jam stringeret hordea culmo  Omnia ventorum concurrere praelia vidi  Quae gravidam late segetem ab radicibus imis  Saepe etiam immensum coelo venit agmen aquarum  Et faedam glomerant tempestatem imbribus atris  Collectae ex alto nubes ruit arduus aether  Et pluvia ingenti sata laeta boumque labores  Diluit implentur fossae cava flumina creseunt  Cum sonitu fervetque fretis spirantibus aequor  Ipse pater media nimborum in nocte corusca  Fulmina molitur dextra quo maxima motu  Terra tremit fugere ferae mortalia corda  Per genteis humilis stravit pavor Ille flagranti  Aut Atho aut Rhodopen aut alta Ceraunia telo  Dejicit ingeminant Austri densissimus imber  Nunc memora ingenti vento nunc litora plangunt  And Mr  Dryden  has made it  English  after so noble a manner that he has done all the Justice that our Language would allow him to the admirable original  Oft have I seen a sudden Storm arise  The heavy Harvest from the Root is torn  And whirl'd aloft the lighter stubble born  With such a force the flying Rack is driv'n  And such a Winter wears the face of Heav'n  And oft whole Sheets descend of sluicy Rain  Suck'd by the spungyClouds from off the Main  The lofty Skies at once come pow'ring down  The promis'd Crop and Golden labours drown  The Dykes are fill'd and with a roaring sound  The rising Rivers float the nether ground  And Rocks the bellowing voice of Boiling Seas rebound  The Father of the Gods his glory shrowds  Involv'd in Tempests and a night of Clouds  And from the middle darkness flashing out  By fits he deals his fiery Bolts about  Earth feels the motions of her angry God  Her Entrails tremble and her Mountains nod  And flying Beasts in Forests seek abode  Deep Horrour seizes every Human Breast  Their pride is humbled and their fear confest  While he from high his rowling Thunder throws  And fires the Mountains with repeated blows  The Rocks are from their old Foundations rent  TheWinds redouble and the Rains augment  The Waves on heaps are dash'd against the Shore  And now the Woods and now the Billows roar  But now let us see how the Psalmist has treated the same subject in the eighteenth Psalm and we shall find that the greatness of  Virgil  is littleness compared to his  In my distress I called upon the Lord and cryed unto my God He heard my voice out of his Temple and my cry came before him even into his Ears  Then the Earth shook and trembled the foundations of the Hills also moved and were shaken because he was wrath  There went up a smoak out of his Nostrils and fire out of his Mouth devoured Coals were kindled by it  He bowed the Heavens also and came down and darkness was under his Feet  And he rode upon a Cherub and did fly He came flying upon the Wings of the Winds  He made darkness his secret place His pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies  At the brightness that was before him his clouds removed hailstones and coals of fire  The Lord also thundered in the Heavens and the highest gave his voice Hailstones and Coals of Fire  Yea he sent forth his arrows and scattered them and he shot out lightnings and discomfited them  Then the channels of waters were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy Rebuke O Lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils  Now in the first place Reason finds its account better here than it does in  Virgil  for the more amazing effects that we see of Divine displeasure the more it answers our Idea of infinite wrath But there is nothing that  Virgil  has said upon this subject but what is much stronger in the Psalmist and there are several things in the latter which are by no means in  Virgil  For example how much stronger is  the Hills also moved and were shaken because he was wroth  than that of  Virgil  Ille flagranti  Aut Atho aut Rhodopen aut alta Ceraunia Telo  Dejicit  Which only signifies the Thunders rending the tops of the Mountains which any one may see is weak in comparison of what  David  says That the very Mountains seem'd to have a sense of the Indignation of their Creator Mr  Dryden  endeavour'd to add strength to this passage of  Virgil  Earth feels the motions of its angry God  Her Entrails tremble and her Mountains nod  But he too falls very much short of the force of the Psalmist for he makes the Trembling of the Earth and the Nodding of the Mountains to be only the natural necessary effects of mechanical motion  And that which satisfies the Reason the more here raises the Passion more strongly and entertains the sences the better because there are more and  more amazing effects of the Divine pleasure For how great how lofty how terrible is that  He bowed the Heavens and came down and darkness was under his feet  How much stronger than that of  Virgil    Ipse pater    c  And how Poetical and how Dreadful is that  Then the Channels of the Waters were seen and the foundations of the World were discovered at thy Rebuke O Lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils  How terribly is the Eye delighted here which is a sence that the Poet ought chiefly to entertain because it contributes more than any other to the exciting of strong Passion And here I desire the Reader to consider that there is more Terror here both ordinary and Enthusiastick and consequently more spirit in a faint Copy nay a Prosaick Copy translated in the Imperfection of our Tongue and by men who in all likelihood had no manner of notion of Poetry than there is in  Virgil  's original What force and what infinite Spirit must there not have been in the original  Hebrew  Since these are thoughts that are so truly great and so truly lofty that they carry with them spirit and force and fire through  whatever head they pass and whatever language how admirable and inimitable must they not have been in the hands of that Divine Poet who knew how to shew them to the utmost advantage The Character of  Buchanan  is by no means Elevation but yet he is so exalted in this description that he soars above  Virgil  who is by nature lofty  Ille super solio residens flammantis Olympi  Audiit orantem postquam pervenit in altum  Clamor

oris  Sic formidandae grave spiritus Infremit Irae  Now how much stronger and more Poetical is  Protinus e vultu Domini conterita Tellus  Intremuit  Than that of  Virgil    Quo maxima motu  Terra tremit  And how much weaker is  Ille flagranti  Aut Atho aut Rhodopen aut alta Ceraunia telo  Dejicit  Earth feels the motions of her angry God  Her Entrails tremble and her Mountains nod  How much weaker is this I say than  Montes{que} cava compage soluti  Nutarunt penitus{que} imis fremuere cavernis  Where  Buchanan  shews the Mountains not only disjoynted with the terrible fright and shaken from their very foundations but every one of them roaring with Infernal Thunder like  Mongivell  or  Vesuvius  Besides that in this passage of the Psalmist every thing is great and every thing is sustain'd whereas in that of the first  Georgick  even the great  Virgil  forgets himself  Quo maxima motu  Terra tremit fugere ferae  Earth feels the motions of her angry God  Her Entrails tremble and her Mountains nod  And flying Beasts in Forests seek abode  How poorly does the last Verse of the Triplet answer to the greatness of the other two  But now if any one pretends here that  Virgil  is describing only a common Storm whereas  David  is describing the extraordinary indignation of God to him I answer that  Virgil  to heighten that common Storm shews it to be the effect of Divine wrath and Divine wrath must at all times be Infinite But to show the Invalidity of such an objection I desire any one to produce any thing from the  Grecian  and  Roman  Poets upon the same subject that is any ways comparable to this passage of the Psalmist For as our Religion gives us more exalted notions of the power of an Infinite Being than the Heathen Religion did to the  Grecian  and  Roman  Poets it consequently produces a stronger spirit in Poetry when it is manag'd by those who have Souls that are capable of expressing it  I could produce a hundred passages more out of Sacred Writ which are infinitely superiour to any thing that can be brought upon the same subject from the  Grecian  and  Roman  Poets  And the only reason why I refuse to do it is because it may be pretended that the Writers in Sacred Writ had the peculiar advantage of Divine Inspiration and that no consequence can be drawn from them in the behalf of the Moderns who pretend not to the same advantage And therefore I shall produce some instances of the preheminence of the Christian over the Pagan Poets whose Authors cannot be pretended to have been Divinely assisted in a more peculiar manner than any of the Moderns may be The first instance that I shall bring shall be from the Hymn of St  Ambrose  a Father of the Church who lived in the third Century a Hymn more exalted than either  Orphens  or  Homer  or  Callimachus  ever produced I have given the former part of it a dress of my own thro the which tho perhaps it may appear disguis'd to the Reader yet even thro that disguise he may discern a Greatness and a  Beauty that are not every where to be found  Te Deum c We praise thee O God    A  Long adieu to mortal lays  Our voice t' immortal heights we raise  And sing the great Creators praise  Thy praise O God thy boundless praise  In more than Human sounds we sing  O for an Angels Tow'ring wing  O Rather for thy Spirit to sustain  Each matchless strain  That it may reach eternal heights  And in its lofty daring flights  The Heav'n of Heav'ns may scale  Raise all your voices strike your strings  'Tis God 'tis God we sing  Sound all and cry with one accord  Hail thou supream of things  The worlds great Author Hail  Hail infinite eternal King  Thee God above all heights ador'd  We all confess and all obey  Prostrate and low and trembling all  Before thy dreadful Majesty we fall  Acknowledging thy boundless sway    Such Homage to their Eastern Kings  The  Indian  and the  Persian  brings  But Eastern Kings alas to thee  Vain Fantomes are of Royalty  That with a false delusive pow'r  Appear and vanish in an hour  For thee what Homage shall we find  Infinite Independant Mind  What Homage worthy of the God  That can unmake us with a nod  Look from thy awful Throne on High  And with thy Omnipresent Eye  Into our Souls recesses pry  There see a Homage worthy thee  Worthy eternal Majesty  See profound Humility  See Souls entirely mortify'd  Down senseless vanity and pride  Vile as thou art vain man appear  Behold Omnipotence is here  When He who only is when He  Appears what Worms what Mites are we  Nay we are not we only seem  We're scarce a Shadow scarce a Dream  A senseless Dream of what is not  That passes and is strait forgot  Thou only art for what thou art  Thou always wilt be always wert  For thou art permanent and fix'd  Uncreated and unmix'd  The Radiant Heavens and Rowling Earth  Owe to thee their wondrous Birth  Thou of ten thousand Worlds art Lord  And art by ev'ry World ador'd  They all confess thy pow'r divine  For thee they move for thee they shine  And ev'ry World's for ever thine  All the Earth doth worship thee the Father everlasting  And this great Planet Earth which rowls  Incessantly around its Poles  And till the end of Time must run  Its Gyant Race about the Sun  And moving round the Lamp of Day  O'retake the Seasons in its way  While slanting in its oblique flight  It shortens or prolongs the night  Thee Motion's fountain and its source  worships in its endless course  Thee while it turns about the Sphere  Accomplishing the mighty year  Its great Creator thee it serves  And thy eternal Laws observes  Creatures to whom great Mother Earth  Fermented by thy Flame gave birth  All that on  Lybian  Mountains roar  Or flounder on the  Indian  shore  All that in Airy Caravans on high  Intelligent of seasons▪ fly  Thro the vast Desarts of th' Aerial Sky  All to their Maker Adoration pay  All constantly thy several Laws obey  Which their distinguish'd Tribes and different Nations sway  Their Seasons preordain'd by thee they know  At thy command they come at thy command they go    None but Irregular man thy Rightful sway  Impious Irregular man dares disobey  Yet Impious man too thee adores  Thee from  Cathaian  to  Peruvian  shores  With nameless rites unnumber'd Tongues he ev'ry hour implores  Before thy Feet Earths numerous Kingdoms all  Before thy Feet a Thousand Monarchs fall  And thee their Everlasting Father call  And thus they cry thy potent Breath  Our great Forefather call'd from more than Death  When thou saidst let him be the sound  Drew him wondring from the ground  To Thee Low the Worlds great Rulers bow  Thou art our God our mighty Maker Thou  Thou formst us at the first and thou sustainst us now  To thee all Angels cry aloud  Now let us Earth and Earthly things disdain  Now let us sing a loftier strain  Now let our Souls to Heav'n repair  Direct their most aspiring flight  To fields of uncreated light  And dare to draw Empyreal Air  'Tis done oh place divinely bright  Oh Sons of God divinely fair  Oh Sight unutterable Sight  Oh unconceivable Delight  Oh Joy which only Gods can bear  Hark How their blissful Notes they raise  And sing the Eternal Makers Praise  How in extatick Song they cry  Lo we the glorious Sons of Light  So great so beautiful so bright  Lo we the brightest of created things  Who are all Flame all Force all Spirit and all Eye  Are yet but vile and nothing in thy sight  Before thy Feet O Mighty King of Kings  O Maker of the boundless all  Thus lowly Reverent we fall  Thou knowst how many of us fell  To lowest Shame and lowest Hell  But thou art Holy thou O Lord  Art only fit to be implor'd  Of Sacred Sabbath God ador'd  And thus they pass Eternity  To thee all Angels in the Sky  And all Archangels loudly cry  The mighty Cherubim  Answer the staming Seraphim  Holy continually they cry  O Holy Holy Holy Lord  Of Sacred Sabboth God ador'd  From them Dominions catch the blissful So  And  the glorious Fugue prolong  Holy continually they cry  Th' Harmonious Thunder rowls adown the Skies  And to the Golden Orbs it flies  The vast Intelligences all on fire  With flaming Zeal compleat th' Immortal Quire  To sing thee Great Creator all conspire  All Ranks divinely touch the living Lyre  O Holy Holy Holy Lord  Of Sacred Sabboth God ador'd  Holy th' Empyreal Spirits cry  Holy the Regents of the Orbs reply  To the great strain they tune their Sphears  And ravish ev'n Immortal Ears  And all th' Harmonious worlds on high  Accompany the Song Divine  And in th' eternal Chorus joyn    Thus thee they always worship all  Thee God of Sacred Sabboth call  For thou hast been of Holyrest  The Angels speak  From vast Eternity possest  When all in you created mass  Does but appear and move and pass  All moves all fluctuates without end  But Spirits that on thine depend  Yon glorious Worlds that floating lye  In the profound Abyss of Sky  In Matters stormy Gulphs are tost  Till in a flaming wrack they're lost  We that so far with Angels ken can trace  Thy Godlike works along the boundless space  See nought from endless Agitation free  But Thee the great th' eternal mover Thee  Ev'n we are mov'd ev'n we are tost  In Blissful Rapture almost lost  Ev'n we sometimes almost complain  Of Transports that are near to pain  Which without Thee we never could sustain  Thou movst us all yet ever blest  Alone enjoyst perpetual rest  Thy great allseeing eyes ne're sleep  And yet for everlasting Days  They Sabboth sacred Sabboth keep  The wondrous subject of our praise  But who tho mounted on an Angels wing  Can ever hope to raise his flight  To such a Towring such a Godlike Height  As Thee with equal Song to sing  Thee God over all Worlds supream  Who must not flag beneath th' Almighty Theme  Wheree're at utmost stretch we cast our eyes  Thro the vast frightful spaces of the Skies  Ev'n there we find thy glory there we gaze  On thy bright Majesty's unbounded Blaze  Ten thousand Suns prodigious Globes of Light  At once in Broad Dimensions strike our sight  Millions behind in the Remoter Skyes  Appear but Spangles to our wearied Eyes  And when our wearied Eyes want further strength  To pierce the voids immeasurable length  Our vigorous Towring Thoughts still further fly  And still remoter flaming Worlds descry  But ev'n an Angels comprehensive thought  Cannot extend so far as thou hast wrought  Our vast Conceptions are by swelling brought  Swallow'd and lost in Infinite to nought  The next Instance is from  Milton  who in the seventh Book of the  Paradice lost  has handled the subject of the Creation better than either  Ovid  or  Virgil  himself has done Tho he is certainly above  Ovid  by the force of his own genius as much as by the advantage of his Religion but 'tis by the latter only that he excels  Virgil  than  whom I do not believe that any man can have a greater Genius When I say that  Milton  excels  Virgil  I mean that he does so sometimes both in his Thought and in his Spirit purely by the advantage of his Religion But at the same time I am very far from thinking that he so much as equals him either in the continual harmony of his Versification or the constant of Beauty of his expression or his perpetual exaltation He writ in a Language that was not capable of so much Beauty or so much Harmony and his Inequality proceeded from his want of Art to manage his subject and make it constanly great For it would be an easie matter to prove that none of the Moderns understood the Art of Heroick Poetry who writ before  Bossu  took pains to unravel the Mystery But nothing can make more for my subject than to show that  Milton  who lay under these vast disadvantages very often excell'd even the Prince of the  Roman  Poets both in the greatness of of his Thought and his Spirit  But first let us see how he surpasses  Ovid  in his description of  Chaos  and the Creation of the World from  Chaos  And in order to that let us see the account that the  Roman  gives of it in the beginning of his  Metamorphosis  Ante mare terras quod tegit omnia coelum  Unus erat toto Naturae vultus in orbe  Quem dixere chaos rudis Indista{que} mole  Nec quicquam nisi pondus iners congestaque eodem  Non bene Junctarum Discordia semina rerum  Nullus adhuc Mundo praebebat Lumina Titan  Nec novo crescendo reparabat Cornua Phaebe  Nec circumfuso pendebat in aere Tellus  Ponderibus librata suis nec Brachia longo  Margine Terrarum porrexerat Amphitrite  Quaque erat tellus illac pontus aer  Sic erit instabilis tellus innabilis unda  Lucis egens aer Nulli sua forma Manebat  Obstabat{que} aliis aliud quia corpore in uno  Frigida pugnabant calidis Humentia siccis  Mollia cum duris sine pondere habentia pondus  And thus Mr  Dryden  has translated it in the beginning of the third Miscellany  Before the Seas and this Terrestial Ball  And Heav'ns high Canopy which covers all  One was the Face of Nature if a Face  Rather a Rude and Indigested Mass  A lifeless Lump unfashion'd and unfram'd  Of jarring Seeds and justly  Chaos  nam'd  No Sun was lighted up the World to view  No Moon did yet her blunted Horns renew  Nor yet was Earth suspended in the Sky  Nor Pois'd did on her own Foundations lye  Nor Seas about the Shoar their Arms had thrown  But Earth and Air and Water were in one  Thus Air was void of Light and Earth unstable  And Waters dark Abyss unnavigable  No certain form on any was imprest  All were confus'd and each disturb'd the rest  For hot and cold were in one Body fixt  And soft with hard and light with heavy mixt  Let us examine  Milton  's description of  Chaos  in the second Book of  Paradice Lost  where he shews Satan and Sin and Death taking a survey of it from Hells Gate  Before their eyes in sudde  view appear  The secrets of the hoary deep a dark  Illimitable Ocean without bound  Without dimension where length breadth and heighth  And time and place are lost where eldest Night  And Chaos Ancestors of Nature hold  Eternal Anarchy amidst the noise  Of endless Wars and by confusion stand  For hot cold moist and dry four Champions fierce  Strive here for Mastery and to Battel bring  Their Embryon Atoms they around the Flag  Of each his faction in their several Clans  Light arm'd or heavy sharp smooth swift or slow  Swarm populous unnumber'd as the Sands  Of  Barca  or  Cyrenes  Torrid Soil  Levied to side with warring winds and poise  Their lighter wings To whom those most adhere  He rules a moment Chaos Umpire sits  And by Decision more embroils the prey  By which he Reigns  Now I leave it to any Reader to judge who has never so little discernment in these affairs which of these Descriptions is most fine most figurative and most Poetical But now let us see how  Ovid  begins his account of the Creation  Hanc Deus melior litem natura diremit  Nam coelo terras terris abscidit undas  Et liquidum spisso secrevit ab aere coelum  Quae postquam evolvit caeco{que} exemit acervo  Dissociata Locis concordi pace ligavit  Ignea convexi vis et sine pondere Coeli  Emicuit summa{que} locum sibi legit in arce  Proximus est aer illi Levitate loco{que}  Densior his Tellus elementa{que} grandiatraxit  Et pressa est gravitate sui circum fluus Humour  Ultima possedit solidum{que} coercrit orbem  And thus Mr  Dryden  has made it  English  But God or Nature while they thus contend  To these Intestine Discords put an end  Then Earth from Air and Seas from Earth were driv'n  And grosser Air sunk from Aetherial Heav'n  Thus disembroil'd they take their properplace  The next of Kin contiguously embrace  And Foes are sunder'd by a larger space  The force of Fire ascended first on high  And took its dwelling in the vaulted Sky  Then Air succeeds in lightness next to Fire  Whose Atoms from unactive Earth retire  Earth sinks beneath and draws a numerous throng  Of pondrous thick unweildy Seeds along  About her Coasts unruly Waters roar  And rising on a Ridge insult the shoar  But how poor is this beginning compar'd to the pompous preparative with which  Milton  ushers in his account of the same thing in the seventh of his  Paradice lost  Heav'n open'd wide  Her ever during Gates harmonious sound  On Golden Hinges moving to let forth  The King of Glory in his pow'rful word  And Spirit coming to create new Worlds  On Heav'nly ground they stood and from the shore  They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss  Outrageous as a Sea dark wasteful wild  Up from the bottom turn'd by furious winds  And surging waves as Mountains to assault  Heav'ns heighth and with the Center mix the Pole  Silence ye troubl'd Waves and thou deep Peace  Said then th' Omnifick World your discord end  Nor staid but on the Wings of Cherubim  Up lifted in paternal Glory rode  Far into  Chaos  and the world unborn  For  Chaos  heard his voice him all his train  Follow'd in bright procession to behold  Creation and the wonders of his might  And 'tis plain that  Milton  owes this Greatness and this Elevation to the Excellence of his Religion How mean is  Ignea convexi vis sine pondere caeli  Emicuit summa{que} locum siti legit in arce  To  Milton  's description of the first great Fial  Let there be Light said God and forthwith Light  Ethereal first of things quintessence pure  Sprung from the Deep and from her Native East  To journey thro the airy gloom began  Sphear'd in a Radiant Cloud  How low is the formation of Earth and Sea in  Ovid  compar'd to  Milton  's  Principio Terram ne non aequalis ab omni  Parteforet magni speciam glomeravit in orbis  Tum freta diffudit rapidis{que} tumesecre ventis  Jussit et ambitae circumdare littora terrae  Jussit extendi campos subsidere valles  Fronde tegi sylvas Lapidosos surgere montes  Thus when the God whatever God was he  Had form'd the whole and made the parts agree  That no unequal portions might be found  He moulded Earth into a spacious round  Then with aBreath he gave theWinds to blow  And bad the congregated Waters flow  He shades the Woods the Valleys he restrains  With Rocky Mountains and extends the Plains  Let us now see  Milton  's account of this  The Earth was form'd but in the womb as yet  Of Waters Embryon immature involv'd  Appear'd not over all the face of Earth  Main Ocean flow'd not idle but with war  Prolifick Humour softening all her globe  Fermented the great Mother to conceive  Satiate with moisture when God said  Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n  Into one place and let dry Land appear  Immediately the Mountains huge appear  Emergent and their broad bare backs up heave  Into the Clouds their tops ascend the Sky  What an Image is here and taken apparently from ourReligion which teaches us the most exalted notions of God and the immediate obedience of the Creatures to their Creator But  Milton  goes on and at the same time sets before us another wonderful sight  So high as Heav'n the Tumid Hills sloow  Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep  Capacious Bed of Waters  But  Milton  goes on  And God said let the Earth  Put forth the verdant Grass Herb yielding Seed  And Fruittree yeilding Fruit after her kind  These three Verses are cold and flat and inharmonious for there can be no true Harmony in Numbers without Passion but let us see whether the Verses that follow will make amends for them  He scarce had said when the bare Earth till then  Desart and bare unsightly unadorn'd  Brought fourth the tender Grass whose verdure clad  Her universal face with pleasant green  Then Herbs of ev'ry Leaf that sudden flowr'd  Opening their various colours and made gay  Her bosom smelling sweet and these scarce blown  Forth flourish'd thick the clustring Vine  forth crept▪  The smelling Gourd up stood the Cornie Reed  Embattell'd in her field and th' humble Shrub  And Bush with frizled Hair Implicit last  Rose as in Dance the stately Trees  What an Image is here again with which none but our own Religion could have possibly supply'd him  Let us now examine  Virgil  's account of the beginning of the World in the sixth Eclogue and see if we can meet with any thing that may be compar'd to these thoughts of  Milton  which at the same time that they are wonderful are simple and are naturally produc'd by the subject  Nam{que} canebat uti magnum per inane coact a  Semina Terrarum{que} animae{que} maris{que} fuissent  Et liquidi simul ignis ut{que} his exordia primis  Omnia ipse tener mundi concr everit orbis  Tum Durare solum Discl udera Nerca ponto  Caeperit rerum paulatim sumere formas  Jam{que} novum ut stupeant Terrae lucescere solem  Altius at{que} cadant submotis nubibus Imbres  Incipiant Sylvae cum primum surgere cum{que}  Rara per ignotos errant animalia Montes  Which by Mr  Dryden  is thus translated  He sung the secret seeds of Nature's frame  How Seas and Earth and Air and active Flame  Fell thro the mighty void and in their fall  Were blindly gather'd in this goodly Ball  The tender soil then stiffning by degrees  Shut from the bounded Earth the bounding Seas  Then Earth and Ocean various forms disclose  And a new Sun to the new World arose  And Mists condens'd to Clouds obscure the Sky  And Clouds dissolv'd the thirsty ground supply  The rising Trees the lofty Mountains grace  The lofty Mountains feed the savage Race  But few and Strangers in th' unpeopled place  And now any one may see how much  Virgil  's God is Inferiour to  Milton  's Angel 'Tis true I know very well that it may be urg'd in  Virgil  's behalf that he does not pretend to set down  Silenus  his Song but only the principal heads of it whereas  Milton  makes the Angel  Raphael  give an account at large of the  Creation I know this very well I say but I am satisfied at the same time that  Virgil  making  Silenus  proceed upon the  Epicurean  Hypothesis if he had given never so full and artful an account of the Creation could never possibly have equall'd  Milton  for that Hypothesis runs directly counter to those lofty Thoughts and those noble Images which  Milton  has shown in such wondrous motion For these Verses  Tum Durare solum Discludere Nerca ponte  Caeperit rerum paulatim sumere formas  And this  Rara per ignotos errent animalia montes  Are directly contradictory of those noble Images which we find in the following account of  Milton  The sixth and of Creation last arose  With ev'ning Harps and Mattin when God said  Let th' Earth bring forth Fruit living in her kind  Cattel and creeping things and Beast of the Earth  Each in their kind  Here are four flat unmusical Verses again but those which follow will more than make amends for them  The Earth obey'd and strait  Op'ning her fertile womb teem'd at a Birth  Innumerous living Creatures perfect forms  Limb'd and full grown out of the ground up rose  As from his Laire the Wild Beast where he wonns  In Forest wild in Thicket Brake or Den  Among the Trees in pairs they rose they walk'd  The Cattel in the Fields and Meadows green  Those rare and solitary these in flocks  Pasturing at once and in broad Herds up sprung  The Grassy clods now calv'd now half appear'd  The Tawny Lyon pawing to get free  His hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds  And Rampant shakes his brinded mane▪ the Ounce  The Libbard and the Tyger as the Moale  Rising the crumbling Earth about them threw  In hillocks the swift Stag from under ground  Bore up his branching head scarce from his mold  Behemoth  biggest born of Earth up heav'd  It is vastness  What a number of admirable Images are here crowding upon one another So natural and peculiar to the subject that they would have been as absurd and extravagant in any other as they are wonderfully just in this And yet even in this subject nothing could have supply'd a Poet with them but so Divine a Religion So that at the same time that the eye is ravishingly entertain'd Admiration is rais'd to a height and the Reason is supremely satisfied For are not these effects that are worthy of an infinite Cause Can any thing be more surprizingly strong than this energetick Image  Now half appear'd  The Tawny Lyon pawing to get free  His hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds  And Rampant shakes his brinded Mane  Is not the following one great and wonderful  The Ounce  The Libbard and the Tyger as the Moale  Rising the Crumbling Earth about them threw  In Hillocks  And how admirable is the next  The swift Stag from under ground  Bore up his branching head  He began to rise even before he was finish'd and his Horns were finish'd in rising  I thought to have proceeded and to have compar'd the Councils and Fights of  Virgil  and  Milton  and above all their Description of Hell and its Torments in which both those great Poets seem to have exerted all their strength But I am afraid I have already run into length and there is matter remaining for an entire volume  And thus I have endeavour'd to show in the former part of this Book that the principal reason why the Ancient Poets excell'd the Moderns in the greatness of Poetry was because they incorporated Poetry with Religion and in the Second Part That the Moderns by joyning the Christian Religion with Poetry will have the advantage of the Ancients that is that they will have the assistance of a Religion that is more agreeable to the design of Poetry than the  Grecian  Religion  The End
