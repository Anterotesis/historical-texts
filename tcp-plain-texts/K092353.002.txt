Printed for J BELL near  Exeter Exchange Strand  and C ETHERINGTON at  York  MDCCLXXII  GENUINE LETTERS  LETTER LXIV Mr PRESTON to Miss NANCY BLISSET  Oxon  March    My Dear  IN this Letter I shall give you some Remarks on only one Book of the  Odyssey  namely the Seventh  Verse and contain a very just Observation on the Temper of a Mob  and that too perhaps in all Countries and all Ages  Is the Epithet  rude  which is applied to the  Phoeacians  Verse entirely reconcileable to the Character given of them at Verse in the last Book  From Verse to is a most charming Description of the Palace and Garden of  Alcinous  Does it not appear to you that  Ovid  has borrowed the Description of the  Palace of the Sun  in the second Book of his  Metamorphoses  from this Place  Verse Here is a Passage very expressive of that Hospitality you have remarked and admired so much  From Verse to we have a great Resemblance to the Holy Scriptures One of the Apostles commands us  to relieve Strangers inasmuch as such have entertained Angels  We see it was so with  Lot Abraham Jacob  c and further it is said that  God  conversed with  Moses  Face to Face as a Man does with his Friend  At Verse are the two Lines with which the Critics have found great Fault in the Translation as being too mean The Expression "craving Bowels" is rather beneath Mr  Pope  's usual Style  Ver    All Night I slept  oblivious  of my Care  Methinks  forgetful  of my Care would from its Simplicity have suited the Subject better  I have done with this Book so shall release you from Criticisms at present and change to another Subject in which I would recommend a little of that Hospitality we so admire in the Antients I desire nay insist that you will prepare a little  genial Board  for your BirthDay as I shall do Invite your Mama your Aunt and any other Friend you like and I beg you will not suffer any thing to be abridged on this Occasion to save a few Shillings I know your Turn for Oeconomy but remit the Strictness of it for once Besides the Pleasure it brings it may answer some useful Ends It will give you an Opportunity to shew your own Address as Mistress of the Feast display your Respect to your Parents in an amiable Light and at the  same Time gratify your affectionate Sensations I am a Friend to little Indulgencies of this Kind when confined within proper Restrictions and not too often repeated Thus directed they come within the Compass of Virtue otherwise they extend to Profusion  Pray do as I desire so wishing you many happy BirthDays  I am  my dear Angel  yours J P  LETTER LXV  Oxon  March    My Dearest  I Hope this will be delivered into your Hands tomorrow being your BirthDay when you are with your Friends or preparing to be with them I wish you many such Days and that they may be happy Give my humble Service to all that are with you when this comes to Hand or that are to be with you in the Evening  I went to the Inn myself yesternight and gave Mrs  Bew  very peremptory Directions about your Box so I hope you will receive it safe  You are now entering into a new Year of your Life The best Advice I can give you is to be thankful to God for the past and shew your Gratitude by using the coming Year well As you are going to be chearful with your Friends I will not detain you long  You have read of  Pacolet  's wooden Horse who on turning a Pin flew through the Air with his Rider and went a great Journey in a few Moments I could wish for such an Horse tomorrow Night and after spending four or five Hours with you to mount and come back here but as such a Wish is vain I must even be content to want that Pleasure and within two or three Weeks make use of a wooden Coach instead of  a wooden Horse and travel over Land instead of flying through the Air  I hope you will spare so much Time tomorrow Evening as to write me if it is no more than two or three Lines and in the next Letter after that I must have the History of this Evening your BirthDay and Sunday Salute your your Mama Aunt and Mrs M with a Kiss for me Again I wish you a haypy BirthDay and many more and am my dear Ange  your most sincere Friend and Servant JOHN PRESTON  P S  Remember what I told you in my last I insist upon it that your BirthDay is not kept in a poor niggardly Way Remember I insist upon it Adieu ma chere Petite  LETTER LXVI  This and the two preceding Letters being written on Days subsequent to each other are an undoubted Proof that our Tutor's Attention was as much awake to his Pupil's Pleasure and Amusement as to her Instruction How admirably does he unite the Friend with the Preceptor  Oxon  March    My Dear  HAving an Opportunity of sending this by a private Hand I could not omit to wish you all Health and Happiness  on  your BirthDay May you  know your Duty to  God  your Neighbour and to yourself and practise what you know May you enjoy a moderate Share of the good Things of this Life have Health of Body and Content of Mind and then you need no more  I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  LETTER LXVII  Oxon  March    My Dear  JUST now I received yours of the th and was about to be much surprized that you was so long in answering all the Letters I wrote you last Week I was  suddenly taken ill on your BirthDay and though I had engaged myself to pass the Evening at a Gentleman's Chambers in  Baliol College  yet I could not sup but after drinking your Health and two or three sparing Glasses more I was forced to quit the Company and return home I kept my Bed two Days and have not been out since Though somewhat better now I still continue ill Pray write me soon again and let me know how your Mama does I shall be sure to acquaint you how I am I dare not venture to write farther it is with Pain I have written this  I have made Remarks on the eighth  Odyssey  but must defer them till my next  My Spirits are low Your Letters cheer as well as delight me  I am  my dear Nancy  yours most affectionately J P  LETTER LXVIII  Oxon  April    My Dear  I AM not yet quite recovered and have been out but once to wit this Day  Probably Easter Sunday  to Chapel it being a high Festival and the Sacrament administered  I am mightily pleased with your Observations on  Rochefaucault  I shall make some few Remarks here on the th and th  Odyssey  if I can get through them but I am doubtful of my Ability as I yet cannot endure much Application  From the Beginning of the th Book we find the great Duties that were most highly esteemed in antient Times were Prayer Praises Hospitality and Sacrifices attended with Music  Though the Resentment of  Ulysses  at Verse is very just yet surely he carries it too far  Mr  Pope  mentions the Opening of the th Book to have given great Joy to the  Critics who wished to find Fault with so great an Author I wonder what provoked them  Ulysses  only animadverts on the happy State of the  Phaeacians  which is extremely just and by no Means inconsistent with Virtue To me therefore all Apologies to soften the Matter are entirely useless  Verse Quaere what is meant by the Expression  a like Reward  Ver    We sate indulging in the genial Rite  I am at a Loss to know why the Translator makes use of this Expression here the  genial Rite  The Speech of  Ulysses  to  Polypheme  beginning at Verse is excellent The last eight Lines are beautifully translated  and the Matter of them highly pious and instructive  Verse I think all this  fort outr√©e  notwithstanding all that Mr  Pope  has said to make it pass as well as the whole Story of  or  Noman  By all Means let me know how your Mama and Aunt do Write soon no Matter on what Subject I would hear any thing from you though ever so trifling As drowning Men catch at Straws for Relief so dispirited Folks catch at Trifles for Comfort not that your Letters can ever be such to me  I am  dear Nancy  yours sincerely J P  LETTER LXIX  Oxon  April    My Dear  I JUST now received yours of the th I am somewhat better but not entirely recovered  If you chuse  Milton  or  Virgil  for the Subject of our ensuing Correspondence I shall be pleased but if you like better to write such Thoughts as occur to you on any Author you happen to be reading at the Time of writing I shall be very well satisfied It is true there is a noble Fund in  Milton  and  Virgil  but I would not keep you always confined to one  Kind of Study The Book of  Job  the  Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes  the  Wisdom of Solomon  and of  the Son of Sirach  supply large and rich Funds for Observations but take your own way and please yourself  I should not have written you till I had read four or five more Books of the  Odyssey  unless you had been impatient and as the Post is just going out I shall not add more here nor even transcribe my Remarks on two Books of the  Odyssey  that are ready so you will probably get five together  I may see you about this Day fortnight or perhaps sooner In the mean Time keep yourself employed Write  about something no Matter what The Mind requires Exertion and it is as liable to be disordered through Inactivity as the Body  I am  my dear  yours J P  LETTER LXX  Oxon  April    My dear Nancy  IT is worth Observation that  Homer  every now and then scatters short moral Reflections as he goes along for Example Book x Verse  Rare Gift but oh what Gift to Fools avails  No Wonder indeed he is so pregnant with them since Virtue is the great End of his Work  The Interview between  Ulysses  and his Mother in Hell Book xi Verse is exceeding fine  At Verse we have a new Instance of the Hospitality of the Antients  Verse In spite of all that is said in Defence of  Homer  here I cannot help thinking all this Speech very mean and unworthy of  Ulysses  The Description of  Hercules  at Verse is very awful  I am of Opinion that if you take the whole Account of  Ulysses  's Descent into Hell and compare it with that of  Aeneas  in  Virgil  's sixth Aeneid you will find the former fall infinitely short of the latter than which nothing sure was ever written with greater Mastery of Fancy and Judgment It is worth your while to compare them  Now we are to leave the  Phoeacians  and I cannot for my Heart think they were so worthless a People as the Commentators would make them Are they not kind hospitable and beneficent Do they not understand the Arts of Sailing Building Gardening Commerce and so forth All that can be said against them is that they lived luxuriously  and is there any Wonder that such a happy People should live so  The Commentators excuse  Homer  for the strange improbable Stories he makes  Ulysses  tell because he tells them to an idle credulous vainglorious People But in my Opinion this is no Defence at all for as they do not contradict his Narrations so it is immaterial as to the Truth of the Stories who he told them to  Virgil  in my Opinion has not only happily imitated the Story of  Elpenor  in the twelfth Book of the  Odyssey  but has also improved upon it Herein the Latin seems to have an Advantage over the Greek Poet  Homer's Elpenor  was a  worthless Fellow yet the Author treats him as a Man of great Importance  Ulysses  first meets him in Hell where there is a long Conversation between them and undeserving as he was great Care is taken about his Monument whereas  Virgil  's  Palinurus  besides being his chief Pilot was a Man of Integrity and Virtue  Verse What Reason can be assigned why  Ulysses  did not stop his Ears with Wax as well as the rest The Song of the Syrens here is admirable and Mr  Pope  has rendered it in Lines exquisitely smooth and melodious  Ver    forgetful of the Voice divine  All dreadful bright my Limbs in Armour shine  Was not this Madness in  Ulysses  Yet it were Pity had it not been since it contains a noble Moral in shewing us the Folly and Absurdity of disobeying the Commands of Heaven  The People whom  Homer  devotes to Destruction Verse you are to observe he first prepares for it by a profane and illicit Way of performing Sacrifice They are going to perpetrate an impious Deed and they address themselves to it in a profane Manner Compare this with the Sacrifices of  Korah Dathan  and  Abiram  and with the Offerings of  Nabal  and  Abihu  who put unhallowed Fire into their Censers See the Book of  Numbers  Chap xvi c The Vengeance which overtook the Companions  of  Ulysses  for destroying or taking to their own Use what was consecrated to  Apollo  seems to be a general Warning to Mankind not to convert to profane Uses what has been once set apart for religious Purposes  Book xiii Verse Here is a fine Representation of  Ulysses  and it is much heightened by the Simile Had you ever been in the Country at the Time of great Labour you would be much more sensible of the Strength of it but the Justness speaks for itself  Verse I cannot but think that the Doubts of  Ulysses  after he knew the Person who spoke to him was  Pallas  are unjustifiable and unreasonable  Ver    Tho' leagu'd against me hundred Heroes stand  Hundreds shall fall if  Pallas  aid my Hand  How very like is this Sentiment to what is frequently said in the Holy Scriptures For Instance  I will not be afraid for ten Thousands of People that have set themselves against me round about  Psal  iii Ver  At Verse we have one of  Homer  's short moral Reflections  Set thy Soul at Rest  And know whatever Heav'n ordains is best  We now come to the fourteenth Book one of the most beautiful in the whole Work This was my Favourite when I was a Boy and has remained so ever  since Nothing can be more simple natural and affecting than this Interview between  Ulysses  and  Eumoeus  The whole indeed is such a sweet Scene of the Country and contains such a Series of Piety and Goodness as fills the Mind with inexpressible Delight What an exquisite Picture does the Poet give of  Eumoeus  at the Opening  Verse How true even to this Day is the Observation which  Eumoeus  makes in this Place  Ver    These while on sev'ral Tables they dispose  As Priest himself the blameless Rustic rose  It appears that  Homer  notwithstanding he has a great Respect for the Priesthood  thought every Head or Chief of a Family was a sort of Priest in his own House at least in case of Necessity and this many People contend for at this Day Even some very learned and pious Men maintain that if a Society of Men were cast on some Place where they could not have the Ordinances duly administered by a legallyadmitted Clergyman it were then lawful for a Layman to perform the sacred Functions Something of this Nature is the Permission which the Church of  Rome  gives to Midwives to baptize in Cases of Necessity  Verse    From God's own Hand descend our Joys and Woes  Here is a Piece of Theology exactly  correspondent to what many Christian Divines maintain  Verse Here follows a strange Contrivance to get some Cloaths against the Rigour of the Season which I cannot think altogether necessary considering how humane an Host  Eumoeus  is described  Mr  Pope  seems to differ much in Opinion from  Longinus  about  Homer  when he wrote the  Odyssey  I cannot but join with  Longinus  in thinking  Homer  was on the Decline Though it is a charming as well as instructive Composition yet it seems to me to carry some Marks of old Age If you have never seen  Longinus  I will bring one to Town You  may read it in a short Time It is a small Treatise but admirably judicious Recall what  Pope  says of him in his Essay on Criticism  Thee great Longinus all the Nine inspire  And fill their Critic with a Poet's Fire  An ardent Judge who zealous in his Trust  With Warmth gives Sentence and is always just  Whose own Example strengthens all his Laws  And is himself the great Sublime he draws  The Post is just come in but not a Syllable from you which makes it less welcome to me The Duke of  Hamilton  is to come here on  Tuesday  which will take me off from writing you any more on  Homer  for some Time yet  let not that hinder your writing and give me every thing that occurs  Adieu  my dear Life  I am yours J P  LETTER LXXI  Oxon  April    Ma tr√®s chere petite Ange  I Have now finished five Books more of the  Odyssey  and my Remarks shall be as short as I can possibly make them  Book xv Verse Here we meet another Instance of the great Hospitality of the Antients  Verse and some of the ensuing Lines contain admirable Rules for good Behaviour then for what it is now and ever will continue The last Line I allude to namely  Welcome the coming speed the parting Guest  is liberally just but then the Manner of putting it in Practice should be as delicate as the Precept itself  Verse What  Homer  here observes of dedicating a Part of a WinterNight to Conversation and particularly to the Recollection of past Afflictions is very natural and just  Verse  To bend a Bow with tender Skill  appears to me a very odd Expression  Book xvi Verse What follows here is very natural and beautiful especially the Dogs playing so familiarly at the Return of the Prince whom they knew so well Observe their Behaviour was far different when  Ulysses  came  Verse When  Telemachus  has enjoined  Eumoeus  to announce his Return to his Mother how beautifully affecting is the Swain's Reply  I hear and I obey  But old Laertes weeps his Life away  And deems thee lost shall I my speed employ  To bless his Age a Messenger of Joy  His compassionate Concern for the Grandfather's dejected Situation joined to the Readiness wherewith he undertakes to carry glad Tidings to  Penelope  is the  Result of the most humane and benevolent Mind  Verse    The Dogs intelligent confess'd the Tread  Of Pow'r divine and howling trembling fled  This Notion prevails among Country People at least in Scotland to this Day They fancy the Dogs are sensible when a good or an evil Spirit comes into a House  Verse  Ulysses  discovering himself to his Son affords us a very fine and pleasing Scene yet I think it much inferior to that of  Joseph  making himself known to his Brethren I confess  Verse    Argus the Dog his antient Master knew  What a Pack of unfeeling Wretches must they be who cavilled at this Incident of the faithful Dog All that  Pope  says on it does Honour to his own Humanity and Discernment  Book  xix  Ver    Then chaunting mystic Lays  The Power of curing Wounds by Charms or Incantations is still believed by many common People  On Sunday I hope to send you some more Observations and finish with the  Odyssey  by the Time I come to Town which perhaps will not be before  Wednesday  You see my Remarks now come within a very small Compass It would be as endless as unnecessary to animadvert on every Beauty I shall at all Events write again on Sunday and  let you know to an Hour when I come to Town I would certainly have come on  Monday  but the Duke of  Hamilton  does not go from this till  Saturday  after that I must go see Lady  Susan Keck  the  Duke  's Aunt who lives twelve Miles from this from her I return to  Oxford  and thence set off for  London  Do not neglect to write me The  Duke  took his Degree of Doctor of Laws yesterday there was a vast Crowd and the whole University metHow does your Mama  I am comme auparavant  ma tr√®s chere  veritablement le votre J P  P S  You did not write me if you wish to see  Longinus  Your Mama's Letter is just come to Hand  LETTER LXXII  Oxon  April    My Dear  ON Sunday I received a Letter from you of no Date which I impute to the Hurry you were in when you wrote it If the Duke of  Hamilton  had not been here I had seen you before now He went away on Saturday I accompanied him to  Henley  about Miles from this City stayed there all Night and returned hither on Sunday My Visit to  Tew  the Place where his Grace's Aunt resides was to have been made  this Day but is deferred till my Return from  London  so I shall see you sooner than I thought and perhaps may be able to tell you the exact Time before I seal this Letter  The Duke of  Hamilton  has no Occasion for the Degree of Doctor of Laws but it is an Honour the University pays him It is customary to confer different Degrees of Honour to those who study therein That of  Batchelor of Arts  may be taken after having resided so long a Time and undergoing such Examinations as are appointed In the same Manner Students may be advanced to the Degree of  Master of Arts  Afterwards they can be promoted to a  Batchelorship  in one of the three great Professions  Divinity Law or Physic and after that they may be made  Doctors  in those Professions according to the different Studies they have pursued But sometimes these Degrees are conferred without waiting the ordinary Time or passing the Examinations  Honoris Grati√¢  that is to say to do Honour to the Person who receives them This was the Case with the Duke of  Hamilton  he having been greatly beloved esteemed and respected for his Behaviour while at this University I hope I have now satisfied your Curiosity but I had almost forgot to tell you that sometimes a Doctorship in a fourth Profession is given namely in Music but this is not held in any wise equal to the others  I have now taken my Place in the StageCoach for Friday next so if it please God I hope to see you about eight o'Clock at Night on Saturday at farthest  I am with my hearty Services  ma chere Petite  le votre J P  LETTER LXXIII  Oxon  May    My dearest Angel  I Arrived safe here yesternight between seven and eight nothing having happened worth mentioning except that I  was mortified with a great deal of impertinent Chat in the Coach We were forced to drive two Miles out of the Way to set down two Boys at their Mother's Door One Passenger grumbled much at it I asked him whether he would not in the Parent's Situation wish for such a Courtesy at the trifling Inconvenience of a short Delay to the Passengers and in fine Weather He received the Reproof in Silence though he did not seem by his Looks to thank me for it There are more such unfociable Persons to be met who prefer the Indulgence of their own peculiar Humour to any essential Gratification or Service they can bestow on others Poor People they are composed of very indifferent Principles or have been very ill taught  I have found all my Friends here well No Revolutions or News in our littte Society since I left it  I shall now finish the  Odyssey  but as I have several Things to do and settle and Letters to write you may perhaps not hear from me again for two or three Days As soon as I have finished the  Odyssey  we shall think of something else to furnish out our epistolary Conversation You know no Post goes from this Place on Saturday nor arrives here on Monday so you cannot expect a Letter from from me again till Tuesday at soonest and it may be later yet let not that prevent your writing  At the Beginning of my Letter I mentioned impertinent Chat I will give you one Instance There was one Fellow in the Coach who told us three Times a long dull and consequently tedious Story of his having been at the taking of a Highwayman but that like a prudent Soldier he reserved his Fire till he had Occasion for it When he had told it us once he took care to repeat it as often as any new Passenger came into the Coach which produced on the whole a third Narration He described the Highwayman's Person and Dress his Horse his own Horse the whole Chace his personal Intrepidity the taking Trial and Condemnation of the unhappy Rogue with a Thousand more contingent Circumstances equally  important and entertaining How natural is it to repeat as well as to aggrandize Matters which we think may redound to our own Credit The Story still buzzes in my Ears and haunts me like a Ghost but if I dwell upon it any longer I shall become as troublesome as the Relater so I break off  I am  my dearest  yours J P  LETTER LXXIV  Sunday    o'clock May    My dear Nancy  JUST now I received yours which was very acceptable My first was under Cover you'll see it is not franked  the second was sent  tout droit  which is the Reason why they were both delivered at once The Story of the poor young Lady makes me melancholy  I informed you some Time since that the  Proverbs Ecclesiasticus Ecclesiastes  and  the Wisdom of the Son of Sirach  would furnish us with Materials for writing You cannot read more profitable Books believe me and if you bestow a due Share of Attention and Reflection on them you will find them exceedingly pleasant as well as profitable  Let me know if you have been with Lady W yet Be not too bashful yet withal never lose that graceful Modesty which is the greatest Ornament of your Sex Never give yourself Airs never  press to  shew away  as they call it Hate and detest Affectation foolish Pride and Vanity Be affable and courteous to all be inwardly familiar with few Neither harm nor speak ill of any one and be not concerned for Fame and Admiration  Observe these Rules which though few if well observed will shew you to the World in that Light wherein it is your Desire and Interest to appear without your giving yourself any Trouble about it  I am avec mes Complements  my dear Angel  your faithful Friend J P  LETTER LXXV  Oxon  May    My dear Nancy  ONCE more for the Odyssey I have got through three Books more on which I have made but few Observations  Book xx Verse The Complaint of  Minerva  in this Place is analogous to that which we find so often made by our Saviour in the Gospel  O ye of little Faith  c  Verse  Ulysses  desiring a Sign to confirm his Faith in this and the two  following Books is exactly conformable to many Places in Scripture The Story of  Ahaz  as well as of others will sufficiently prove it  Book xxi Verse Is it not too much affected to call  Ivory Elephant  It is done however in other Places as well as in this  Verse The Suitors impute their Impotence in bending the Bow of  Ulysses  to their Profanation of a holy Day Whether it was a fictitious or a real Excuse it shews at least that Irreligion was held a very atrocious Crime in  Homer  's Time  Verse  Ulysses  turning and examining the Bow to prove if it was decayed  or wormeaten amid the Taunts of the Suitors and his bending it compared to a Musician winding up the Strings of his Instrument is most admirably fine The Notes here are well worth reading  Verse This is an exquisite Comparison The Twang of the String short and sharp like the shrill Note of a Swallow was equally a Mark of Vigour and Address  Book xxii Verse All that follows here relative to  Phemius  and  Medon  their Supplication the Interposition of  Telemachus  and the Motives which induced Ulysses to spare them excite both our Pity and Admiration The Idea which  Phemius  gives of Poets and Poetry is  one of the finest that can be conceived and worthy to be imprinted on every Memory  For dear to Gods and Men is sacred Song  Selftaught I sing by Heav'n and Heav'n alone  The genuine Seeds of Poesy are sown  And what the Gods bestow the lofty Lay  To Gods alone and Godlike Worth we pay  nor sordid Pay  Nor servile Flatt'ry stain'd the moral Lay  Verse Here is a most just and beautiful Comparison The Situation of the Fishes so poetically rendered by Mr  Pope  must touch every compassionate Mind  All naked of their Element and bare  The Fishes pant and gasp in thinner Air  I must return to Verse of this Book Read the Note upon it and tell me if you don't think the Caution of placing the Bow out of the Reach of the Suitors was needless when none of them could bend it  My next shall finish the  Odyssey  Adieu  J P  LETTER LXXVI  Oxon  May    My dear Nancy  I Shall in this close what I have to say on the  Odyssey  Book xxiii Verse Here are four Lines which are very consonant to what  we frequently meet in the holy Writings particularly in the th Chapter  Isaiah  "Surely the Princes of  Zoan  are Fools c"  Verse and some following Lines contain Sentiments very analogous to many in the Book of  Job  It is worth your while to compare them with the following Chapters which indeed are worth the most attentive Perusal and Remarks  Verse This Conversation between  Ulysses  and  Penelope  how naturally beautiful In all Degrees of Life we may hourly trace the same Consequences of a long Absence whether between Man and Wife or Friend and Friend The  Episode of  Mercury  conducting the Souls of the Suitors to Hell at the Opening of the th Book is undoubtedly fine though after all that can be said in Defence of it to me it appears brought in to use a common Phrase by Head and Shoulders It seems as if the Poet had the Character of  Achilles  so much at Heart that he thought it not sufficiently compleated without this finishing Stroke  Verse  Homer  you observe takes every Opportunity to pay Honour to Poets and Poetry These two Lines  The Gods to honour her fair Fame shall raise  Their great Reward a Poet in her Praise  and the six preceding are so strong and at the same Time so charming an Incentive  to Virtue that I cannot but think a Woman who has a laudable Ambition and Love of Virtue must be greatly confirmed by them in a virtuous and honourable Course of Life  Verse I cannot endure  Pope  's bald Expression of  the old Man  for so he makes Ulyssses stile his Father In  Homer  it is  the Father  which has undeniably much more Decorum Respect and Affection  I have nothing further to add to what has been said in the Notes on the Close of this great Work I shall endeavour to get you  Kennel  's Translation of  Horace  's Judgment on the  I  iad  and Odyssey All other Translations of that Passage are bad His only is tolerable  I scarce need remark to you that  Virgil  copied much from  Homer  particularly in the sixth and last Book but methinks it would be entertaining to compare the Passages of two such great Poets and two such fine Translators as  Pope  and  Dryden  I have received only one Letter from you since I left London yet this is the fifth I have written to you  I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  LETTER LXXVII  Oxon  May    Dear Nancy  THE whole Hall is gone on a Merrymaking this Day into the Country except the Principal Dr  King  and myself I have therefore laid hold of this Occasion to send you  The Furniture of a Lady's Mind  and Extracts from another Poem by Dr  Swift  I think them both instructive and pleasing In my last you know I enclosed some select Passages from his  Grizette  I transcribed as much of it as I thought worthy your Notice This Author excellent as he is often mixes a Something very gross even in  his wittiest Poems  This in all Probability was the Reason why Mr  Preston  chose to transcribe select Passages from  Swift  's Works rather than lay the Author at large before his Pupil  When you have read those Passages tell me if you do not think it a most judicious Distinction between affected and real Wit Wit mingled with ill Manners instead of that Decorum and Modesty which best becomes your Sex  Swift  did not think so ill of Women as he wrote His Motives were to wean them from such Faults as he thought them most subject to There is a good deal of Affinity between the  Grizette  and  the Furniture  c I will send you two or three little Poems more by the same Author and shall be glad to have  your Opinion of them I mean when you are at Leisure for I do not desire to oppress you  Pray put the enclosed into the PennyPost  I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  LETTER LXXVIII  Oxon  June    Dear Nancy  JUST now I have the Pleasure of of yours You thank me for what does not deserve Thanks The Picture was drawn to my Hand and I thought  it a Picture worth your looking at though I assure you I had not the least Idea that it resembled you Had I thought so I should not have been at so much Pains as to transcribe it merely to mortify you Yet your Application may turn to some Account it may serve as a Hint or Notice to shew you what you are to shun or as a Beacon set up to warn you of the Rocks and Shelves whereon many of your Sex have been shipwrecked  I now send you two Songs leaving you to find out where their Value lies and when you have wrote me your Thoughts of them I will then let you know wherein I think their Merit consists I do not know if ever you read the  Progress  of Love  if not I will send it to you You have herewith the  New Ballad of New Similes  It is really true that Sir  Alexander Murray  is dead He died at  Edinburgh  on the th of May  My Compliments to your Aunt and Mama  I am  my dear Nancy  yours very truly J P  LETTER LXXIX  Oxon  June    My dear Nancy  JUST now I received yours Your Observations are very just The whole Song consists of a Heap of fine  smooth Words put together either without any Meaning at all or ending in downright Nonsense after the Manner of many of our modern LoveSongs I would have you observe too that there are no less than two Similes in so short a Poem which is very ordinary in our LoveSongs though very unnatural and besides that they have no Relation to the Subject they are very absurd in themselves  The other Ballad is a very severe Satire on the Gentlemen of the Army The Beauty of it consists in its appearing so very serious and being so exceedingly ridiculous I beg you will particularly observe the two last Stanzas save one Here the personated Officer  accuses himself both with Cowardice and Ignorance of Letters Mark how ridiculous a Fall he makes in Stanza the third  Alas I never thought a Priest would please your Palate  This seems to be grave and serious observe what follows  Besides I'll hold a Groat he'll put you in a Ballad  How serious does he appear when he says  It fills my Heart with Woe c  and afterwards calls a Churchman being by the Ladies preferred to an Officer "the Growth of Corruption  c"  It  is all through a most admirable Satire and the Humour is exceedingly well hit off Then it is calculated for the Tune of  Patie  's  Mill  If you heard it sung to that Tune you would find it set off mightily it being a sweet complaining Scotch Tune the Captain's Complaint if we may so call it would thereby become still more ridiculous  Charles Murray  does not succeed to the Title but a Son of  David Murray  who was an elder Brother than  Charles  A Campaign is the Warfare of one Season and to open the Campaign implies no more than to begin the military Operations of such or such a Year  When I send you a Production written with Spirit Wit and Judgment either for or against your Sex you are to understand the Contents as so many Hints to you what you are to shun and what you are to pursue I have herewith enclosed three very severe Pieces but do not fancy I am drawing your Picture I am only offering that to your View from which you may discern Beauty from Ugliness The next three I shall send will be much more pleasing but do not be so vain as to imagine them intended to represent you neither though I trust you come much nearer these than what I send you now I shall give you my Sentiments of these three Portraits in my next  I am my dear Ange le votre J P  P S  I don't desire you to write oftner than you like but consider well what you write  Adieu  LETTER LXXX  Oxon  June    Dear Nancy  I Suppose you have before this comes to your Hand formed a Judgment of the three Ladies I sent to wait upon you I mean  Sylvia Artimesia  and  Phryne  You may learn something from the Conversation of the two first but as for Madam  Phryne  I cannot say you can improve by her and indeed but that she has a little Wit in her Conversation I  had not sent her to you at all  Sylvia  is a poor Lady who struggles between Virtue and Vice and is really not so bad as she would appear She has taken up a false Notion of the Means of recommending herself to the Esteem of Mankind She thinks illnatured Wit Censure and Raking are the Ingredients for the Composition of a fine Lady yet her Heart recoils every now and then How many poor Women have lost themselves through this foolish Notion There is nothing more dangerous for any Person especially a Woman than to set up some wrong Quality as the distinguishing Mark of her Character A Coward perhaps sets up for a Bully a chearful Woman for a Prude or a modest goodnatured Girl takes it into her Head to  be a Termagant Now besides being unnatural from quitting their proper Characters they are all alike full of Affectation than which nothing is more detestable except downright Incontinence  Artimesia  is a Prude but a masculine Prude she affects Learning but neglects Decency Cleanliness and Modesty If I were with you I think I could name three Persons with whom the Characters agree very well though I could not tell you the exact Persons the Poet meant  I have herewith sent you a fourth Character which is not so bad as the former for I think it very natural as well as excusable for People especially Women to talk of their Children Family  Affairs and so forth and still more so in Country Places where they meet their Neighbours only now and then Hence I think the Doctor rather too severe unless he barely meant that Women should not carry this sort of Discourse to Excess  I have now sent you five or six bad Characters of your Sex to which you may add whatever you may have read beside  Congreve  furnishes many namely Mrs  Fondlewife  Laetitia  in the  Old Batchelor  Mrs  Frail  Love for Love  Mrs  Foresight  Love for Love  Lady  Froth  Double Dealer  Lady  Pliant  Double Dealer  Lady  Touchwood  Double Dealer  Lady  Wishfort  Way of the World  Mrs  Marwood  Way of the World    c  c  and even his virtuous Characters are worth observing for their Failings for Example the Affectation of  Belinda  Old Batchelor  and  Millamant  Way of the World  and the Wildness of  Angelica  Love for Love    Some Critics have asserted that  Congreve  has drawn none but vicious Characters but I think they are mistaken  Cynthia  Double Dealer  is an Exception He has many other beautiful Characters not faultless indeed That Writer was too great a Master of Nature to draw  Faultless Monsters that the World ne'er saw  as the Duke of  Buckingham  calls them We must not forget  Ben Johnson's  Lady  Wou'dbe  Volpone  and  Otway  's  Lady Dunce  Soldier for the Ladies  These bad Characters which weak undiscerning People have condemned as  mproper for Representation and thence have endeavoured to decry the Utility of the Drama in general have all their good Tendencies There is something to be culled out of every one worth observing and shunning and those who say that faulty Characters should not be produced on the Stage might with an equal Degree of Propriety assert that there should be no Shade in a Picture  In my next I will send you some pleas  ng Characters from the same Author but in the mean Time by the way of Music between the Acts I give you some  Extracts from Dr  Swift  's Poem on his own Death You will find in it a great deal of Wit Humour good Sense and true Judgment of Mankind and the Faults of both Sexes most humourously exposed and ridiculed  Perhaps you may have read this Poem already notwithstanding attend to it once more Much Good may be derived from it Vice and Folly appear in so many Shapes that it is worth our while to study as many and as various Characters of faulty Men and Women as we can find in order to warn us against them in whatsoever Shape they may appear or attack us I shall refer a Translation of a Passage of this Tendency from the noble Historian  Livy  to  my next Letter but observe when I said that we should study as many of these Characters as we can I meant to imply if they are  welldrawn  for if they are not we may mislead and deceive ourselves  If Affairs will permit I could wish you to come and stay a while here this Summer but then you ought to bring a Recommendation with you to some Family here for indeed I am not acquainted with any otherwise I fear your Time may go off very heavily  I am  my dear Life  your J P  LETTER LXXXI  Oxon  June    Dear Nancy  I JUST now received yours of yesterday I am perfectly of your Opinion about the Verses on the  Dean's Death  and especially of those four Lines which are so lively a Representation of what usually happens on such Occasions  I have one Word more to say about  Artimesia  It is not a vicious Character only it includes a Want of Decency and a total Neglect of all the Duties of Life for the Affectation of Learning If I remember right  Pope  imputes much the same Charge to Mrs  Haywood  and  Centlivre  I have said thus much for the Sake of quoting you four Lines from the admirable  Boileau  which I think much  apropos  Que les vers ne soyent pas votre eternel Emploi  Cultivez vos Amis soyez Fille de Foy  C'est peu d'etre agreable et charmante dans un Livre  Il faut s√ßavoir encore et converser et vivre  I have not much more Time for writing at present but on Sunday I will send you many Things to make Amends for what I now defer I shall not send you the pleasing Characters I mentioned till then but to recompense your Patience I enclose the  Progress of Love  with which I believe you will be much pleased I likewise convey you some Lines  of Mr  Pope  on the BirthDay of Mrs  Blunt  a Lady whom he admires There you will see another faulty Character drawn in the Lines I have marked  Phyllis  is another of the same Species yet these and those I sent you formerly are all different from each other  I have not Time to say more so    I am yours J P  P S  I shall continue to send you occasionally some more of the Dean's comic Pieces  LETTER LXXXII  Oxon  June    Dear Nancy  I Here enclose you two Poems in one of them the estimable and unbecoming Qualifications of your Sex are set in Opposition to each other by Way of Contrast How lasting are those of the first Sort how fleeting those of the latter Beauty and all external Advantages are ingeniously compared to Fruit ingrafted on the Stock of an annual Plant which indeed makes a luxuriant Shoot but is soon gone I presume you know that an annual Plant continues only one Year such as Fruits Vegetables and  Corn of all Kinds Those which last many Years as large Trees we call Perennials  In the other Poem the  Dean  pursues  Epictetus  's Notion of Things in our own Power such as Virtue and Truth He makes small Account of Beauty Shape Complexion and such Qualities as we cannot procure to ourselves but Honour Chastity Decency Integrity and all within our own Power to attain he places in a most estimable Light  Ovid  in his  Art of Love  which I believe you have by you or at least have read finely pursues the same Train of Ideas both in his two first Books which he wrote to instruct the Men and in his  third which he calculated to regulate the Conduct of Women  There is something exceeding singular in the Humour of both Poems In  Stella  's  BirthDay  he continues the Strain he began with in talking of her He then puts these in Opposition and as it were Foils to her as if they were really  Signs  Witness those four most humorous Lines  Then who can think we'll quit the Place  When Doll hangs out a newer Face  Or stop and 'light at Chloe's Head  With Scraps and Leavings to be fed  I have many more entertaining Pieces for you of the  Dean  's such as  Mary the Cookmaid  's  Letter to Dr Sheridan  and two Ballads  the one stiled  Quadrille  the other  Molly Mog  which I will send you at some future Time if you tell me in your next Letter that you have not seen them I do not think it a Trouble to transcribe a Piece of any Length provided I am assured you reap either Instruction or Delight from it but both these united ought to be the Result of Reading If  you  do not acquire this Advantage the Fault I should conceive must be in my wrong Choice of Materials You are docile and quick and with a Person of your Talents Hints and transient Observations delivered in this light easy Mode of a Letter will go further than all the set formal Rules for teaching that ever were laid down  Till I send you the above you shall have  Prometheus  written against  Wood  and his Halfpence It is very full of Wit I give it you therefore now by way of Relief and at some future Time you shall have his favourable Characters of Women  I think it necessary to premise some Account of the abovementioned Poem which possibly you are a Stranger to  A Man whose Name was  Wood  obtained a Patent from King George I to make Halfpenny Pieces of base Metal which were to be current in  Ireland  This Project would have drained that poor Kingdom of all the good Money but the  Dean  under the Name of  M B  Drapier  wrote such smart Letters and Poems sometimes serious and sometimes ludicrous as to raise a Resentment against  Wood  that abolished his Scheme The Nation would not receive any of his Coin and the Coiner was in Danger of being torn in Pieces From that Time the  Dean  was looked on as the Deliverer of his Country  You talk of going to  Richmond  for a few Days You must stay a Week abroad at least otherwise it is not worth your while to go During your Excursion you should go by Water to  Hampton Court  see that Palace the famous  Cartoons  of  Raphael  and the Beauties of King  William  's Court Then I would recommend to you to walk through the Park to view the  Cascades from thence to  HamHouse  and so return to  Richmond  I give you this Advice because I wish that every thing you undertake even a Scheme of Dissipation should answer some useful End A Survey of fine Painting feeds the Mind by enlarging the Fancy the Walks and Cascades shew what human Art is capable of and even a Meadow or common Field are Sources of Learning Piety and Admiration in an attentive and welldirected Mind  My humble Duty to your Mama and Aunt  I am  my dear  yours J P  LETTER LXXXIII  Oxon  June    My dear Nancy  I Have your Letter of the th but where has it been It was not put into the Post till yesternight for the PostMark bears the th Day of the Month the Letter itself is dated the th and I have only received it this Day Here is an Interval of nine Days However now that it is come at last I am very well pleased with it It is written very clean and genteel It has the Appearance of coming from a  Gentlewoman  People are not in general sufficiently aware how much they expose  themselves to Censure or Ridicule by a wrong or careless Manner of acquitting themselves in trifling Affairs A neat or a slovenly Disposition may be known as well in the Folding and Address of a Letter as by personal Acquaintance  Your Thoughts and Reflections are entirely just and prettily expressed entirely of a Piece with the Neatness of the writing so that if I may use the Expression I love both the Soul and Body of your Letter  I here send you  Prometheus  and Part of a Song wherein there is a pretty Contrast of three young Ladies In my next Letter I propose sending you three Poems all written in Favour of the Ladies to  make Amends for the disagreeable Pictures I shewed you before After these you shall have  Mary the CookMaid  and  Quadrille  with some Things out of  Horace  which although the Translation is not dressed in the best Poetry in the World will in Respect to the Sentiment I dare say give you much Delight  I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  P S  There is one Passage in the Poem of  Prometheus  which requires Explanation It is this following Line  Venus was brib'd to let it pass  The Dutchess of  Munster  was meant by  Venus  who was bribed by  Wood  to get the Patent passed by the  King  LETTER LXXXIV  Oxford  June    My dear Nancy  I Never heard of that Song of  Stella  and  Flavia  which you say is now so much in Vogue I wish you would get me a Copy of it I have at last sent the beautiful Characters I promised and hope you will like them I leave you to find out the Beauties in the  Extract  and  the Lady at Court  but I must have a Word or two about  Biddy Floyd  which I dare say you have seen long before now  The Humour it is true is whimsical but exceeding just You see it is given by way of Receipt and carried on pretty much in the Stile of common Receipts for making Jellies or Conserves In the first Place he gives you the essential Qualities and then points out the Faults which are apt to grow up with them and from which those Qualities ought to be separated For Example he says that  Candour Innocence and Goodnature  should be picked clean from  Demureness Aukwardness and Coyness  the Seasoning or Pickle to those fine Qualities consists of  Good Breeding Wit Air and decent Pride  cleansed from  Coquetry Affectation Pertness and Vanity  This you must allow to be very apt and judicious perfectly in the Stile of common Receipts For Instance now  To preserve Apples you must separate the Fruit from  The Peel the Stalk the Core and Seeds  you must then make use of  The finest Sugar free from all Dross  and during the Process to clear off the Scum as it rises and so forth  This is all as instructive as entertaining and I do think my dear Nancy that every young Woman should always carry this  Receipt to make a Beauty  about with her The Female that is  seasoned  and  preserved  in this Manner take my Word for it will be a  Beauty  in the Eyes  of all sensible Men and Women though  Jove  in mixing up the Composition has not perhaps employed his finest Clay  In my next I will send you the  Quidnuncs  it is in my Opinion a fine Tale full of Humour and carries with it a very useful Moral  I am  my dear  yours J P  LETTER LXXXV  Oxon  June    Dear Nancy  HAVE you an Inclination for  Molly Mog  or the  Letter to Mr John Moore  about Worms They are both diverting  You have now read the  Journal of a modern fine Lady  It sets forth the foolish unprofitable Manner in which many Ladies pass or rather waste their Time in so lively a Strain that I think you should read it often and that with great Attention Not that I mean to imply any immediate Necessity you have for it but though you do not stand in need of it by way of Remedy it might serve to carry about as an Amulet or Charm a kind of Preservative against the Evils it is calculated to cure  Livy  the great  Roman Historian  says the Use of History is to teach us what we are to shun and what we are to imitaee This ought to be the great End of Poetry as well as History And  Horace  who was one of the most judicious Poets that ever lived in any Age or Country tells us this Instruction is to be attained from a Mixture of the  utile  with the  dulce  that is of the  useful  with the  pleasant  Now in all the little Poems I have sent you I think there is this Mixture and they likewise answer the End prescribed by  Livy  they  teach what we are to shun and what to imitate  Horace  's golden Rule of  utile dulci  was never more properly applied than when it was made the Motto of a Theatre since the Stage under suitable Regulations is most capable of answering the Intent The greatest moral Writers can only prescribe Rules for a Rectitude of Conduct and Decorum of Behaviour  the Stage shews you the Beauty and Force of those Rules when put into Practice It moreover answers the great Purpose and Use which  Livy  ascribes to History It shews  what to shun and what to imitate  more immediately and accurately than any Historian whatsoever is capable of doing  I enclose the  Quidnuncs  I think there is not any thing necessary to subjoin by way of Note except to tell you that the Duke of  Orleans  was Regent of  France  in this King's Minority He was a very great Man and died when I was in  France  in the Year  I should be glad to know exactly when you set out for  Richmond  because I  think I can provide you a very agreeable Companion in the literary Way It is a Poem called  The Alley  It describes all inconvenient and disagreeable Circumstances which are met in the pleasantsituated Town and Villages on the Banks of the  Thames  It would be an Entertainment to you any where and at any Time but you will be much more sensible of the Beauties when you are passing through those Places I therefore shall not send it till you tell me that you are about to set forward  You shall have two or three little diverting Poems tomorrow  Adieu  my dear apt Scholar  I am ever yours J P  LETTER LXXXVI  Oxon  June    My Dear  I Send you herewith a small Collection of  Epigrammatical  Poems the Beauty of this Kind of writing consists in a certain Point or Turn of Wit They are rather for your Diversion than any thing else This perhaps you may reproach me for as deviating from the great  utile dulci  which I so strongly recommended in my last Letter But provided this Rule is generally practised there is no Harm in a short casual Deviation as there is not any thing amiss in rising to a Game of Battledore and Shuttlecock  after a long sedentary Application to Reading or Writing nay it is rather right than wrong inasmuch as it tends to render both Mind and Body like  Aesop  's relaxed Bow  fitter for Use when you want them  The Happiness of a Parson's Life  is surely exceeding humorous It very naturally describes those simple and humble Pleasures whereof a Country Clergyman's Life consists Yet these perhaps afford a more lasting Satisfaction though not so exquisite an Enjoyment than those which are more refined and what the  French  call more  spirituelles  at least they are very innocent Pleasures  One of the next two Poems I shall send you is called  the Elephant  or  ParliamentMan  and the other  Aye and No  They both satirize with great Wit and Humour the Corruption of  Members  which so shamefully prevails at present The Parliament I presume you know is an Assemblage of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons of a Kingdom for national Purposes It derives its Name from the French Verb  parler to speak  We have our English Word  Parley  from the same Root Perhaps you could have told me this and perhaps not and your Ignorance nevertheless not to be taxed with Blame It is amazing how much Knowledge is lost for Want of a little common Attention or Observation in our general Intercourse  with the World Numberless are the Instances I have seen of sensible clever People being put to the Blush and to a Difficulty by a simple Question proposed from a Person of inferior Talents and be infinitely astonished at themselves that they should have been so long ignorant of so plain a Matter  If I have a Letter from you by this Day's Post which I look for I will add a Postscript Pray see that the enclosed be immediately put into the PennyPost  I am with due Respects  my dear Nancy  your J P  LETTER LXXXVII  Oxon  June    My dear Nancy  YOUR Letter just now came to my Hand I find that which I wrote you this Day Se'nnight is miscarried I enclosed  the CookMaid's Letter  in it and If I am not mistaken sent it under Mr K 's Cover Perhaps he consigned it to the PennyPost and it has been mislaid or neglected there It is worth your while to enquire at the little Office near you and if it be entirely gone I will send you another Copy of the Poem I mentioned therein that I would send you a Letter of Introduction  to a Family at  Richmond  and your not noticing this Particular convinces me that same must be what we have lost  Now to your Questions  A  Rap  is a Blow and likewise a base Coin used in  Ireland  The  Whigs  are for destroying the  Church  or at least for reducing it The Tories are for exalting it  Down with the Church  and  Up with the Church  were frequent Expressions with the respective Parties  The  MillDam  is the Place where they keep a Reservoir of Water to set  the Mill going Observe though this is only for WaterMills and the Sound you know pretty near that of a vulgar Oath  Pinking  is making small Holes This was more in Use at the Time of the old English Habit when the Doublets for Men were laced as Stays are for Women Captain  Bluff  in  Congreve  you know says  I'll pink his Soul  in Allusion to this Fashion  The AnaBaptists are not baptized till they come to Years of Discretion and then they are plunged not sprinkled The first Part of the Word is adopted from the Greek  which signifies against or contrary Thus they are  against  baptizing till such an Advance of Life  The  MortuaryGuinea  is the Parson's Due at Burials for reading the Service Churchyard Fees  c  It is derived from the Latin Word  Mors  which means  Death  thence too we have  mortal  You shall have all the Poems you write of In the mean Time I send  The Elephant  and  Aye and No  which I believe will please you much  I hope to hear from you soon to know if you are removed and all Things settled and how you like your new Apartments I am my dear Heart  yours J P  LETTER LXXXVIII  Oxon  July    My dear Nancy  I Write to you so often and you write to me so seldom that I am afraid you begin to be tired with the Correspondence but hope my Fears are groundless I assure you it is not every one I would take so much Pains for I thought that the Want of Amusements in  London  at this Season of the Year would have rendered my frequent Writing a sort of Diversion to you and in some Measure an Amends for the Loss of others In order to make this Diversion as agreeable and instructive as I am  able I have transcribed several Poems such as I thought would best contribute to both these Purposes  You have Talents so capable of Cultivation that to be weary of receiving Instruction would argue an Ingratitude to Nature and I cannot think you liable to it Perhaps I write too often perhaps I burthen you with a Frequency of Subjects or perhaps a little Lassitude and Inattention comes over you now and then which at your Time of Life are excusable if not indulged too far If that be the Case confess Such Omissions call at worst for the mildest Reproof but I cannot help saying they would become many young Folks better than you  Convinced that you cannot be purposely negligent I shall proceed in the old Way I herewith send  Mary the CookMaid's Letter to Dr Sheridan  and  The Grove  translated from  Pastor Fido  by the Earl of  Roscommon  This is one of the best Pictures of a happy Life that I have ever seen true Content and true Love virtuous and innocent are here delineated in their native beautiful Colours I shall send you two or three more Poems which I think equal to the former when I next write and then rest awhile or turn to some other Subject I will not hurry you at all I request that you will write only when you have Leisure and be at Pains to do it in a right Manner You have gained great Esteem by so doing for some  Time past do not now begin to forfeit it  If there be any Passages or Expressions in what I send which require an Eclaircissement let me know so much and I will explain them to you as fully as I am able All I do is meant to contribute to your Delight Nothing can give me more Pleasure than to hear that you are happy Virtue and Piety are the certain Road to Happiness Let me hear you are virtuous and I am sure you are happy  Let me know certainly when you go for  Richmond  My humble Service to Your Mother and Aunt  I am  my dear  always yours J P  P S  You may perceive my dear that the above was written before I received yours and the Reasons for your apparent Remissness are very satisfactory I shall write again tomorrow and answer that Letter et vous envoyer l'Epitre recommendatoire  LETTER LXXXIX  Oxford  July    My Dear  I Here enclose a Letter to Mr Oy at  Richmond  under the Hill Any one will tell you the Way to his House Go there the Morning after your Arrival If you do not go by ten o'Clock you  may happen to miss of him should that be the Case leave the Letter and your Name and go again after Dinner about three  Now to your Questions  A  Congress  is a Meeting of Ambassadors to settle Variances between different States and Kingdoms  Cambray  is a Town in  Flanders  where such a Congress was held The Word  quadruple  signifies  fourfold  and four Sovereign Powers were there going to enter into an Alliance at that Congress but some strong Exceptions being started they disagreed and broke up their Party at  Quadrille  I think  Stella  and  Flavia  very pretty but it does not to me carry the Air of Dr  Swift  's Writing I have enclosed the  Alley  which I promised should accompany you on your little Tour Consider the  Cookmaid's Letter  well and it will amuse you much You will find some Things in it very like what are called Blunders some Words are used for others as  whereof  and  whereby  some are introduced that have no Meaning at all as  which  and  it is four Years  c Now the Word  which  has no Relation to any thing then  see the Clock strikes ten  and  not that I know to my Knowledge  In a Word it is exceeding good  low  Humour and that was all the Author intended In order to relish any Piece well it is necessary to consider thoroughly what  the Author proposed and how far he meant to go if he compasses his own Design though the Work may not entirely satisfy your Imagination he has done his Part and the Deficiency is not to be charged on his having done too little but on your having expected too much  Did you ever see  the Furniture of a Lady's DressingRoom  If you have not I will send it to you though it falls short of Dr  Swift  's usual Humour it is nevertheless worth your reading In Fact there cannot be any Production of a great Genius which is not worth one Revisal provided it be within the Bounds of Decency  Do you propose to let me know how I shall direct to you during your Stay at  Richmond  or must I give overwriting till your Return to Town  I am  my dear Nancy  very affectionately J P  P S  I have sent you six Franks under another Cover You will find Mr and Mrs Oy very sensible knowing People  LETTER XC  Oxon  July    My dear Nancy  YEsterday I received your agreeable Letter but you put no Year of our Lord I don't like this careless Way because it is the Means of contracting an ill Habit Besides you begin a new Sentence with a small Letter and place no Point between that and your last which ought never to be done for though the smaller Points such as Commas and Semicolons may be omitted full Points never should  When you go to  Richmond  you will be hurried about in seeing various Places This was the Reason for my mentioning an Interval and I meant no more by it but as Franks begin to be scarce I shall be pleased if you write me once a Week and tell me every Occurrence worth Observation in your Journeys and how you are received Perhaps they may be worthy to be called  The Lady's Travels  not to  Spain  but to  Richmond  You have not yet said when you are to set out nor how you are to get my Letters or transmit yours to me The PennyPost does not reach  Richmond  but there is an Office at  MarshGate  very near the Town Your best Way to write to me is in my Opinion to keep your old Direction and add  by  London  I suppose you will take out your few Franks with you  I send you with this  The Journal of a modern Lady  In my next you shall have the  new Simile of a Woman to a Cloud  and in the next after that  the Cloud's Answer  though there are some Indelicacies I much disapprove However you are now very capable of discerning adopting and rejecting as best beseems I have taken up  The Furniture of a Lady's DressingRoom  I believe ten Times in order to transcribe it for you and have flung it aside as often I find on Examination it does not please me  When you come from your Excursion I will execute a Promise I made some  Time since namely to send you  Horace  's Judgment of the  Iliad  and  Odyssey  How much I regret that so exquisite an Author as  Horace  was should not hitherto have been translated with that Spirit and Energy he deserves He had a most elegant Pen yet he too had now and then his Grossnesses but they like  Shakespeare  's Puns were rather the Fault of the Age he lived in than Deficiency in his own Taste I will however get you the best Translation I can of the abovenamed Piece and some others  This is the third Letter I have written you this Week  I am  my dear dear Nancy  ever yours J P  P S  On Recollection you had best write me by the GeneralPost and not trust to the other I am greatly pleased with your last it is so clean and so distinct the Faults I have already mentioned alone excepted  LETTER XCI  Oxon  July    My Dear  I Have just now received your Letter and am very sorry for your ill Fortune but as this Day and yesterday have been pretty seasonable and as the Weather seems to be settled I hope it will now make you some little Amends If  not you must endure with Patience or return home ungratified  You will possibly think me a very cold dull Philosopher to preach up Patience and Forbearance to a Person at your Time of Life I confess they are hard Lessons to learn at any Time but especially so while the Heart is gay the Passions warm and Wishes impetuous Permit me however to make one short Observation which may in some Measure qualify those impatient irksome Sensations that arise from Disappointments  The great Reason why Disappointments sit more uneasy on young Folks than on Persons advanced in Life is that the former assure themselves of a  proposed Enjoyment beyond the Power of Chance to prevent it They no more advert to the Possibility of a cross Accident than if there were no such Thing in Nature Now methinks it is easy to remember that there is such a Thing as a Disappointment as well as a Delight If you my dear Nancy when you project a Scheme of Pleasure for yourself or have one proposed to you would but make it a Rule to say  I ought not to set my Heart on this  it would awaken you to all the Chances against you and so qualify your Mind as to endure the Disappointment without repining and even enhance the Enjoyment if your Wishes are gratified  I sincerely wish this Advice may have the same good Effect on some of my young Readers as it had on Miss  Blisset  She adopted it the Moment it was given to her as the Basis of her future Happiness It is her neverfailing Custom to meet all Disappointments whether in a trivial or a material Concern with the most perfect Composure of Mind She may indeed with great Propriety be said to be beforehand with ill Chances since on a Scheme of Pleasure being proposed she immediately adverts to the Prevention instead of the Acquisition neither does this give any Flatness to her Enjoyments for I have heard her say it either increases her Relish or their Value her Pleasures not being worn out in Anticipation they come to her with all the Gloss of Surprize and Novelty She attributes the whole Exertion of this philosophical Virtue and the Advantages she has reaped from it to the kind and excellent Instruction given by her Tutor in this Letter    I wonder you neglected to take a Book with you Never travel without one if you do you go without your best Companion in Case of foul Weather or Disappointments  If the Weather should continue favourable which I hope it may do not  by any Means omit the Sight of  Hampton Court Ham Walks  and  Kew Gardens  You neither tell me when you went out nor whether you received the Letters I sent you after the Date of your last with the Extracts from  Cadenus  and  Vanessa  and  The Journal of the modern Lady  but I can excuse that considering your Uneasiness If this reaches you at  Richmond  pray wait on Mr and Mrs Oy with my hearty Service  Much Enjoyment attend you if you obtain your Wishes Patience if you do not  I am  dear Nancy  yours entirely J P  LETTER XCII  Oxon  July    My Dear  I Received yours of the th just now I am glad your Mama has condescended to stay another Week for notwithstanding my philosophic Admonition it would grieve me that you should be disappointed of your proposed Pleasure I hope you will let me know how you like the Places you see about  Richmond  The Country all around is charming Be sure not to omit the  Green  nor indeed any Place Every Object is Food to a contemplative Mind and without Observation our Travels are nothing  worth You may smile perhaps at my Application of the Word  Travel  to your little Excursion and think it rather ludicrous but I do not mean it so At your early Time of Life and considering the little you have seen of the World the Phrase is not so improper as at first it may appear  You seem not to relish your Reception at Mr Oy's you think it was cold but it consisted only in  Manner  A second or third Visit will convince you of this They are very friendly sincere People but have no Ostentation Such Persons generally improve upon our Acquaintance whereas those who are full of Professions and external Ceremonies like great Promisers too often defraud our Expectations  In your Progress to  Hampton Court  I beg you will observe the Village of  Teddington  It is a Place which I love much  As soon as I send the Answer to the  Simile  here enclosed I shall give you my Thoughts on the  Dean  's Way of treating these Subjects but this must be after your Return to  London  Give my humble Service to your Mama I wish you both much Pleasure Be sure to write me again before you go away and let me have the whole History of your Travels and Adventures and pray take Time in doing it you seem to write in Haste at least your two last Letters carry this Appearance It is not how speedily but  how properly you acquit yourself that will gain Approbation  I am  my dear  your most affectionate J P  LETTER XCIII  Oxon  July    My Dear  I AM glad my last arrived safe and that you have had the Satisfaction of seeing some Things about  Richmond  worth Observation I should be pleased if your Mama would let you stay a little longer as you seem to like it so well I think too it would be of Service to  both your Healths You may give my Respects and say I join in the Request that she would grant this Indulgence  I don't know the Adventures you speak of but why not buy the Book if you cannot borrow or hire it I would rather you should do so than have your Curiosity left ungratified and as I know the prudent Motive that has restrained you from making the Purchase I beg you will let me be at the Charge of all such Books as you wish should compose your little Library But you need not be quite so much at a Loss where you are Mr Oy has a good Collection of Authors and if you will ask the Favour I am sure he will lend you any you desire or let you come and chuse for yourself But  then you must take great Care of what you have and regularly return one when you wish for another otherwise you will find him reluctant Some Persons would perhaps accuse him herein of being particular but it is a Particularity which I have frequently seen and why should a Compliance with it be deemed hard since it is no more than is consistent with common good Manners Lovers of reading very often take up a capricious Fondness for their own Books and in Case of an Author being lost it is not always that a new and perhaps neater Edition will make Amends  I have seen Lord  Cholmondeley  's fine Room but it was not finished when I saw it  The  Cloud  was written by Dr  Sheridan  I think but the  Answer  by Dr  Swift  The latter is in my Opinion much the wittiest so I have sent it enclosed  I hope your Stay will be prolonged for you will not easily forgive yourself if you do not see  Hampton Court  and the fine Cartoons of the immortal  Raphael  The StairCafe and the Beauties of King  William  's Court are well worth your Notice as are the Lodge and Cascade in  Bushy Park Ham Walks  will also give you great Pleasure but of another Kind The former will rather raise your Wonder I mean the Court and Paintings the latter inspire with a soft Delight You will be more at home  here as you are happily possessed of a greater Relish for the humble than the exalted Scenes of Life Hence you will feel much Indulgence I believe in passing through my favourite Village  Teddington  I have now done with Dr  Swift  and shall by way of Foil send you the  Description of a Lady's DressingRoom  which is an Imitation but far inferior of the Doctor's Way of Writing however you may in some Measure learn  what to avoid  by reading it There are many Things in that Part of  Ovid's Art of Love  which Mr  Congreve  has translated worth noticing in order to a Lady's making herself agreeable besides the criminal Part This latter ought to be  carefully and judiciously distinguished and you are very capable of doing it from the trulyuseful and allowable nay commendable Precepts which he lays down  After sending you some few Reflections on  Swift  's Way of Writing I will turn to  Horace  next It is a great Pity that we have never yet had a good Translation of him but so it is and indeed he is so difficult to be rightly hit off that I despair of ever seeing one  I am  my dear Nancy  your most faithful Friend J P  P S  I am much pleased with your last Letter  LETTER XCIV  Oxon  July    My Dear  I HAD the Pleasure of yours of the d instant No Letters go from this on Saturday so I could not answer you sooner  If the Weather prove fair this Week I suppose you will go to  Hampton Court  where I think you had better stay a Night that you may see every thing at Leisure All the Places I wrote you of are in your Way Let me scheme for you  I would go by Water to  Hampton Court  return the next Morning on Foot it is a pleasant Walk through the Park to  Teddington  there take Water to  Ham House  and from that walk to  Richmond  Now your Mama and you have got to so pleasant a Spot methinks I would have you stay some Time As I said before it will improve your Health and Spirits If you are come abroad with Finances too narrow for this let me know and I can give you a Draught on Mr Oy He is my Banker all my Monies go through his Hands so there is nothing improper or inconvenient in it  I am much delighted with your delicate Reasons for declining my Offer of furnishing you with Books but you are too nice Any thing in my Power my dear Nancy that may contribute either to your Health or Pleasure I think well bestowed that is to say while you are so deserving in every Respect Perhaps I might do the same were your Merit not quite equal to what it is but not with the same good Will and I know your Disposition would scorn to be obliged when you thought you did not deserve the Obligation  As I told you in my last Mr Oy I am sure will let you have any Book you desire If you could find the Life of  Guzman d' Alfarache  I think it would  entertain you I well remember when I was young it entertained me  I expect to be called to  London  some Time next Month but am not certain exactly when You shall know before I set out Now to what I proposed about Dr  Swift  Although  Swift  was a very nice Judge of Mankind I mean herein to include both Sexes and consequently found many Things to censure and might possibly on that Account have too great a Contempt for the Generality of the World yet we must not thence conclude that he was either a ManHater or a WomanHater He wanted only to correct Vices and though he launched  into personal Satire against many partiticular Men who I believe deserved it at his Hands yet I do not remember that he has been guilty of the same against the fair Sex  In the next Place it may be observed that he has perhaps painted his Characters  larger than the Life  as the Painters phrase it but this is often necessary to make the deeper Impression as Figures larger than the Life must be adopted sometimes in Painting and Statuary for the very same Purpose especially when placed at a great Distance But whoever reads his Works attentively will find that his Characters though sometimes too strong are nevertheless perfectly natural  His Satire or Censure of your Sex has various Sources It is sometimes drawn from Faults incident to the Sex in general that is to say Faults or rather Weaknesses which Women are more subject to than Men and which may be said to arise from the Sex itself for Example Fear Whims and idle Fancies These you see he wishes to eradicate from their Minds  At other Times his Satire arises from Faults to which your Mode of Education exposes you namely Affectation Dissembling TittleTattle amusing yourselves with Trifles of Dress Colours Shapes  c  for which indeed you are not to be blamed yourselves but the Persons are who have had the Care of your Youth  Some Faultinesses which he arraigns are those that attend certain Times and Places as Fashions and I take the  Modern Lady  to be of this Sort Others are what this or that particular Woman runs into which arise out of Affectation or Vanity and wear at the same Time the Semblance of Virtue Such is the Character of  Artimesia  Perhaps the Author had some particular Woman in his View when he drew this Character  Phryne  and  Sappho  c so possibly had Mr  Congreve  when he drew  Doris  and  Amoret  but then they take Care not to expose any one Of all these I think  Amoret  the nicest because her Faults are hardly distinguishable from Virtue and such as are most  likely to impose not only on the World but even on the Person who has them and I do say a Girl of good Sense and a virtuous Disposition is not in so much Danger of becoming  Phryne  or  Doris  or even  Artimesia  or  Sappho  as she is of becoming an  Amoret  The last Stanza of this little Poem namely  She likes herself yet others hates  For that which in herself she prizes  And while she laughs at them forgets‚ñ™  She is the Thing which she despises  is the most judicious and most true Remark I ever read on the Sex and yet the least noticed By the bye it may very often be applied to our Sex as well as yours and with as much Propriety  Thus you see the  Doctor  has shewn your Sex what they ought to shun in some Poems and what they ought to be in others namely in his  Biddy Floyd a Lady at Court Stella  Mrs  B  c  Adieu my dear I shall write you soon some further Thoughts perhaps tomorrow or next Day but I am afraid I tire you  I am yours J P  LETTER XCV  Oxon  July    I Have not yet got Time to make a Copy of  The DressingRoom  for you but shall do it by the next PostDay and then to  Horace  Besides what I mentioned in my last Letter relative to female Faults there are some which proceed from the Condition of Life Women by their Constitution by their Frame of Body and Mind are more formed for Subjection than Men are Some People indeed have disputed this but it has been rather to shew their Wit and Parts than for any other  Purpose for the Fact is too evident to be denied Allowing it to be so there are then some Temptations which arise from the Condition of the Sex A Desire of Rule or perhaps of having their Will which is as strong in many Women as in Men naturally incites them to find out some crafty Methods to obtain it By the Prerogative of our Sex we go a shorter and more direct Way to work Some masculine Women do the same especially when they meet with soft easy womanish Men but for the most Part it is otherwise Women then I say who are desirous of Sway are reduced to peculiar Contrivances to obtain it they must apply to Art and Cunning to wheedling or teazing according to the Temper of the Persons they have to  deal with I do not mean to infer from this that Women are by Nature more insincere more cunning flattering or more affected than the Men but that it is only the Condition whereto the Disadvantage of their Sex reduces them which is the Source and Origin of such indirect Practices To confirm this we may observe that Children Boys I mean wilt do the self same Thing to obtain what they want from their Parents so will Servants or any Inferiors from their Masters and Superiors But Women who have humane and reasonable Husbands and who are reasonable themselves or are independent in either of which Cases the Condition is different from what I before described are not chargeable with such Subtleties I say  we do not see them make Use of any of these little though too often necessary Arts  I fear I have tired you I have dwelt too long on a Subject too grating to a female Ear I shall therefore only observe that some Faults flow from the Sex are  generical  if I may so call them more arise from Education but most from their Condition or Station in Life  I think it is Dr  Swift  who will not allow that there is such a Thing as masculine and feminine Virtues What is Virtue in a Man is so in a Woman says he I will not dispute that Opinion but I believe I may affirm that there are Virtues as well as Vices in general  more strongly implanted in the one Sex than in the other as for Example Fear Tenderness Compassion c in Women and Intrepidity Roughness Hardiness  c  in Men There are moreover some Faults and Frailties pardonable in the one Sex which are abominable in the other  A young Fellow who rambles about and runs Riot is easily forgiven if a young Woman should do so she is gone at once As  Rowe  says  She sets like Stars that fall to rise no more  I do not presume to say but that the World is rather unjust to be so indulgent on the one Hand and so severe on the other but that is no Kind of Alleviation  to the young Woman who exposes herself to such Danger  There are some Instances on the other Hand If a Woman is frighted at Trifles or Shadows she is compassionated a Man so circumstanced would be ridiculed If Women put on affected Airs or are oversolicitous about their Dress and Appearance at worst they are despised perhaps only pitied but let a Ma  be guilty of such Things he is detested  These Hints my dear were occasioned by the Poems I sent you Yo  may pursue them to a greater Length and they may serve as useful Warning  to shew you where your Danger lies an  preserve you from falling into it To know  where we are most weak is one Step towards our Security Every young Person especially a Female coming into Life should nicely observe the Distinction between the Virtues and Vices of both Sexes and be able to ascertain the respective Conduct necessary to be pursued  The Post is just come in but I have nothing from you I hope you are well My next Letter shall be on a quite different Subject  Je suis ma chere Nannette tr√®s sincerement  le votre J P  LETTER XCVI  Oxon  July    JUST now my dear I have the Pleasure of yours of the th and thank you for it I do not call this an Answer but barely an Acknowledgment for I am obliged to defer sending you the Copy of Verses I promised and writing what I proposed being compelled to go out of Town for some few Days but do not let that hinder your writing to me for your Letters will be sent to me and I can answer them from the Country  I wonder you have so long put off going to  Hampton Court  You should have seized your first good Weather for that that is if your Mama did not disapprove it but if she found herself inclined to rest at  Richmond  I make no Doubt but your warmest Desires for Pleasure would be submitted to her Ease No Duty is so graceful as that which is paid to a Parent and it should be continued through Life the first to be taken up the last to be laid aside  When you return to  London  I will endeavour to get you a little Hoard of Franks but in the mean Time write on and give me Pleasure My Retirement will be improved as my Hours  of Business are relieved by our Correspondence  My Service to your Mama  I am  my dear  ever yours J P  LETTER XCVII  Oxon  Aug    AT my Return to this Place my dear Nancy I received yours of the th of July and yesterday I had another of the th instant I cannot account for the Letter having been five Days on the Road  Your being taken sick upon your Tour must be both a Disappointment and Inconvenience I hope however your Disorder will not increase If it should and you are unable to write beg your Mama to favour me with a Line as you may reasonably suppose I shall otherwise be kept in a very uneasy Suspence  Suffer me here to trouble you with a little Caution which however I cannot think you stand in Need of There is an idle Custom wherein too many of your Sex indulge themselves which ought to be carefully guarded against I mean that of complaining for Trifles and endeavouring to impose a flight Indisposition for a material Illness Some  Ladies who follow this Practice perhaps would never dream of doing it of their own Accords but they have seen the Affectation in others and fancied it became them thus they are guilty of that through Imitation which they would never have been through Principle Such Persons draw on themselves one Inconvenience at least namely that of not being credited when they are really ill  To divert you I will quote a Passage out of  Horace  somewhat similar to this I own the Translation to be very indifferent but the Sense is excellent  A small Retainer in a great Man's Train  Who still is asking and doth still complain  I want a good Surtout'tis very cold  My Trunk is rifled and I've lost my Gold  Does like those cheating Punks who often mourn  I've lost my little Dogmy Gown is torn  Until at last unheeding the Complaint  We give no Credit to their real Want  One that has often been abus'd grows shy  He views a Beggar with a heedless Eye  No Charity bestows altho' he swears  By Heav'n  and softens ev'ry Oath with Tears  Believe me I'm in Want  and sadly cries  O cruel help the poor  The Croud replies  A d'autres Friendwe know you and your Lies  I wish there were a good Translation of  Horace  for your Sake but it is what I despair of ever seeing however I would have you acquainted with him even in such Translation as we have I will get you the best I can very soon  He is a Treasure that you would be glad to be possessed of and though you may relish him but indifferently as he is given in our Language yet it is better than not to be acquainted with him at all  I do not know how long it may be before I see  London  If you are willing therefore we will supply the Absence as usual by Letter and perhaps to better Advantage than if we were together  I am  my dear  yours J P  P S  Since writing the above I have a Letter from Mr K and one from you about the Parcel of Snuff you have been so good to send me I thank you very kindly Such little Remembrances are endearing and sometimes more so than material Services since the latter are generally called out by some occasional Claim of Exigency whereas the former are the Result of a constant Attention and Inclination to oblige The  Portuguese  have a pretty Adage or Proverb to this Purpose which means  Civility costs little and gains much  You ask about the unhappy Accident mentioned in the NewsPapers You perceive by this that the Disaster  did not befal me It is true the poor Servant was drowned by the Boat oversetting Mr L was got out without any Damage I was not in the Boat I have neither mentioned it in writing nor talked of it to any one when I could avoid it Such Events I think are painful to the Hearer as well as the Speaker for this Reason I did not hint it to Mr K  A great Concourse of Company is to be at our Races this Week This Hall will be crouded The Duke of  Hamilton  Earl of  Orrery  and his Son Lord  Boyle  will lye here a Brother of Mr L from the  Indies  and many more Gentlemen  Give my hearty Service to your Mama and Aunt thank them for their kind Concern about me and write me when you think fitting  I am again and again your affectionate Friend J P  LETTER XCVIII  Oxon  Aug    My Dear  I Have yours of the d for which I am much obliged since it brings me News of your Amendment It may appear odd to say I am now very glad to be informed that you have been  veritablement malade  as I would rather that a  Person for whom I entertain such a high Esteem as I do for you should be lost to Health than lost to Truth In such a Case as ours however I know the Generality of the World would not call it a Falshood only an Equivocation but surely instead of mending the Matter this is only making it worse the Fault is the same with the Aggravation of Meanness We see frequent Instances hereof in the common Occurrences of Life and People are either insensible or regardless of them But call the Transgression what by Name you will still it is such as I thought you incapable of and am pleased to be confirmed in my Opinion though by your calling my Quotation from  Horace  a bitter Pill you certainly strained it to a Meaning I did not  intend you should I had some Suspicion of this when I wrote it However I chose to leave it for you to comment on and for myself to defend afterwards which I thus do  Every Fable has or may have a general as well as a particular Application Our Story shews the Danger of People using false Pretences on various Occasions and thereby running a Risque of not being believed when they speak truth This is the general Moral or Application The particular Moral is specified in the kept Woman losing her Credit with her Friend by pretending eternal Wants and Losses a Hangeron with his Retainer and a Beggar with the Passenger Now you chose to introduce a  particular Application to your own Illness which I thought I had guarded against in my Premisal to the Quotation It seems you did not think so and there was no Harm in it it was but the natural Result of a strong and a nice Feeling and were it an Error I would readily take it on myself being as I am the Source of it and again assure you I meant only to amuse not to reproach you  I have bought  Horace  for you but the Translation being very indifferent many Allusions made to Roman Customs and Roman Names of People and Places introduced I fear it will read very heavily You would nevertheless find it worth your while to put up with  the former and be at some extraordinary Pains to make yourself acquainted with the others for the Sake of the prudent Sayings Advices Maxims and Reflections wherewith the Author abounds In short you must for once be contented with the  utile  without the  dulce  for the latter is all left behind with the Original It will somewhat resemble a wholesome Pill without any Gilding  There is another Author I want to make you acquainted with and that is  Longinus on the Sublime  I will get one for you and send it with  Horace  Observe my dear while I am recommending these to you I have no Design to induce you to set up for a Critic or a female Pedant only to enable you to  know the Extent of your own Judgment and how to correct and regulate it to your Profit and Pleasure For this Purpose merely it is that I wish to make you acquainted with some of the best Writers of Antiquity who accurately distinguish between Sense and Nonsense true and false Wit Humour and Farce Sublime and Bombast a noble Flight and a Rant a graceful Complaint and an unbecoming Whining  The melancholy Accident which you enquire about happened in the following Manner  We were at a Treat which a new Comer to the Hall gives to the other Students It  was at the celebrated Place called Godstow where  Fair Rosamond  the Favourite of Henry II was buried A Branch of the Isis runs there which at  London  is called the  Thames  There is a Bridge of two Arches the one was stopped up in order to catch Fish there so the whole Stream was thrown into the other Mr L had taken his Servant into his Boat and was endeavouring to push through the Arch which he had at other Times done without Difficulty but on this Occasion the Impetuosity of the Current suddenly drove the Boat back with great Violence Mr L stumbling against his Servant they were both thrown forcibly on the Edge of the Boat and occasioned it to be so far overbalanced as to be filled with Water Apprehensive  that the Boat would immediately sink Mr L jumped out and was taken up without the least Harm but the Servant staying longer by the Boat was drove further from the Bank and being unable to swim he unfortunately sunk before the Boat which took up his Master could reach him They once or twice got a Pole under him but could not save him I did not see the first Part of the Misfortune for I was not come out from Dinner but arrived Time enough to see Mr L taken up and the poor Man lost  I have gratified your Curiosity but you need not tell the Story out of your Family There is something very shocking in the Idea of a poor Creature being snatched  thus from Life in an Instant and as  Shakespeare  says  With all his Imperfections on his Head  and Calamities like these should serve as a Warning to us all to lead such Lives as might best enable us to meet such Deaths if called on  Adieu  my dear  I am always yours J P  LETTER XCIX  Oxon  Aug    Dear Nancy  I Have just now received yours of the th Some Mistakes have happened between us about Dates which we cannot  easily settle I find and some Miscarriages in the Post which we cannot repair therefore I do not hold it worth our while to enter into a Discussion about them Time illemployed is worse than Time unemployed and the last is bad enough in all Conscience  The entire Occasion of my writing just now is to tell you that I go into the Country to  Tew  tomorrow early and shall not return for two or three Days When I do I shall send you  Horace  and  Longinus  You are probably thinking of their Arrival now I therefore hold it necessary to make an Apology for not gratifying the Expectation I have raised It is in some Degree like not paying a Debt which we have voluntarily contracted  You promised to read those Books in the Holy Scriptures and the  Apocrypha  which I recommended and to let me have your Thoughts of them Why do you not so employ yourself now and write your Thoughts at your Leisure When you get  Horace  and  Longinus  there will be a new Subject of Correspondence But I do not desire to hurry you Write when you find the Spirit of writing upon you that is when you find yourself best inclined to it  Adieu  my dear Nancy  J P  LETTER C  Oxon  Sept    My dear Nancy  JUST now I have the Pleasure of yours I have been hurried ever since I wrote you last I am this Evening returned to Town and must leave it again early tomorrow Morning  My present Business occasions a second Disappointment in the Books I promised They cannot come till I return but believe me you should not wait so long for them if it were in my Power to prevent it I have known People who made a Point of baulking young Folks  of Presents and Enjoyments that had been promised them from a prudent Design as they termed it of inuring them early to Disappointments I hold it the most dangerous Way of proceeding in the World Beside that it will never answer the End proposed for it will be much more likely the Temper should be hurt than improved by it it is practising Cunning and low Artifice with them setting them a bad Example for as soon as they are old enough to discover the Means you use they will be induced to practise the same with you and endeavour to counteract one Craft by another Hence they are early seduced from the first great Principle of Goodness Truth and by Degrees all that is open and ingenuous in the Mind  may be quenched ere they know the Value of it  If I return on Tuesday your Books shall be sent on Wednesday if I do not you cannot have them till Friday Wait with Patience till then and I think you need not wait longer I believe  Longinus  will give you great Satisfaction Our Correspondence about Books and Observations on them has been long interrupted I care not now how soon it is resumed but it shall be at your own Choice I will not hurry you  I have one Letter more to write about Dr  Swift  's Genius and then I have entirely done with that Subject I promised  'tis true to let you have what  Horace  ays of the  Iliad  and  Odyssey  but as I am  o send you the Book itself that Promise  s superseded  I wish for your Sake that the Translation were better or that you understood the Original I will however assist you as far as I am able and in my next Letter point out some Places to which I would have you particularly attend  I am  my dear Angel  your true Friend and Wellwisher J P  LETTER CI  Oxon  Sept    THREE Lines to inform my dearest  Nancy  that I am just returned from  Tew  with Dr  King  where I have staid at least one Day longer than I expected I am just Time enough to keep my last Promise You may send to the Black Bull in Holborn at the Time I mentioned and the Messenger will find a little Box addressed to you containing my Promise and an Author or two over and above by way of Interest for the Principal having been so long due  I want to read  Longinus  myself and to compare it and the Notes with another Edition which I had designed for you but I would not longer delay I have I think sent you the best I have no more to say at present only that I wish to hear from you but that at your Leisure  We shall now begin to correspond in earnest again This Interval of Relaxation may have its Use We shall return to more intense Studies with greater Spirit  I am  my dear  yours J P  LETTER CII  Oxon  Sept    Dear Nancy  YOU have now received the Books  Longinus  is a most admirable Author but he will require a deep Attention in reading I advise you to observe the Notes as you go along not leave them till last When you have made yourself Mistress of them read the Book through again This will give you a very competent Knowledge of him and your Pleasure will be increased in Proportion A real good Author you know like a real good Man improves on our  Acquaintance Your own Judgment will suggest to you the most useful and remarkable Places however I recommend the th th th th and the two last Chapters You will give me your Opinion of the whole in due Time When you enter upon  Horace  you must make great Allowance for the Stile the Measure of his Verse and yet more for the weak Expression in which the original Sense and Meaning is given  This Minute yours of the th Never delay writing because Franks are wanting I hold such a Consideration unworthy to be put in Balance with a Letter from a Friend Postage is cheap enough and your Correspondence is dear to me  I cannot say when I am to be in  London  You will have another little Parcel soon containing some Buckles and other Necessaries which Mr K desired me to procure for him Please to send them to him and he will remit the Price I have advised him what the Amount is Do me the Favour to accept it for the Improvement of your little Library Make such Purchases as Fancy dictates I will not direct or controul your Choice  I am concerned for your Mama's Indisposition I beg to hear about her soon but desire nothing more from you I would not be the Means of employing a Minute of your Time now which  is so essentially necessary to your Care and Attention to her  I have little Leisure at present my next shall be longer When you can return to our usual Custom why may you not write me in French now and then The  Archbishop of Cambray's Dialogues des Morts  c are excellent composed of very fine easy and familiar French They deserve to be read often  I am  my dear  yours J P  LETTER CIII  Oxon  Sept    My dear Nancy  I Have the Pleasure of yours of the th and am glad to hear you got the Things safe and that your good Mama is better You have one of the greatest Comforts and Blessings of this Life a good Parent and indeed you are one of the few young Folks who deserve the Blessing inasmuch as you are sensible of it and by your Conduct towards her prove you are grateful for it May it be long continued to you  I hold myself indebted to you for your ready Acceptance of my little Present it was the most pleasant and grateful Return you could make me There is a Delicacy necessary in accepting as well as conferring a Kindness which is nicely explained by our  Shakespear  He makes  Othello  say to  Iago  who has sworn to devote himself to his Service  I greet thy Love  Net with vain Thanks but with Acceptance bounteous  This Phrase  bounteous Acceptance  is liberal beyond defining it can only be  felt  What is usually called  Taste  consists entirely in  Feeling  and I am not clear that the latter Expression would not be the most proper  I have no Doubt but you will soon get through  Longinus  and all the Notes I know your Expedition therefore wish you to attack him a second Time before you transmit me your Opinion Let me likewise have your Thoughts on  Horace  the Scriptures and the Apocrypha as you go on with them I shall soon give my additional Letter of Observations on  Swift  's Mode of writing  There is a little Publication called  Dialogues sur l' Eloquence en general et sur celle de la Chair en particulier avec une Lettre ecrite √† l' Academie Francoise  by the  Archbishop of Cambray  It is a most excellent little Book and I wish you would endeavour to get it The Bookseller in  ClareCourt  I dare say will find it for  you Read it with the closest Attention it deserves you should for it will assist you in a right Way of thinking and and judging  The Duke of  Hamilton  is or was lately at  Stockbridge  in  Hampshire  I hope he will be soon in  London  But why do you ask  The Translations you speak of may more properly be called Imitations than Translations and you will certainly find more Beauty in them than in  Creech  though they do not follow the Original so close I think therefore  Creech  should be your first Object by way of grounding yourself in the original Meaning of  Horace  then turn to what you please  in particular to  Pope  's Imitations of some of his Epistles and Satires they will charm you  I hope to hear soon and am  my dear Scholar  yours J P  LETTER CIV  Oxon  Sept    My dear Nancy  ON Saturday last I sent you a Letter by Dr  King  's Servant which I hope you have received safe  For these three Months past I have employed my spare Hours in reading such  Authors as have wrote on Poetry for Example  Horace Boileau's and Vida's Art of Poetry Pope's Essay on Criticism the Duke of Buckingham's Essay on Poetry and Lord Roscommon's Essay on translated Verse  I have also been at the Pains to make Abstracts from them all and this for two Reasons first to make the deeper Impression on my Mind secondly to have them to recur to on Occasion  As I said once before I would not have you set up for a Critic but as Nature has implanted in you a Love and Taste for reading I could wish you at this LeisureTime of your Life to acquire as right a Judgment as you can of what you read and be able to converse upon it But your own Discretion must  be your Monitor not to let these Studies engage your Time and Attention to the Neglect of such domestic Qualifications as your Sex and Situation may hereafter demand  I have sent you a loose Abstract of the Duke of  Buckingham's Essay  and if you desire them will furnish you with Abstracts of the rest This may at first View appear an useless Trouble to one who has the Originals at Hand but in Fact is not so it may be of the same Use to you that it was to me and you will still have a much stronger Impression of any Rule or Passage by writing your Remarks to me or adding what is defective to mine for as I did them hastily  no Doubt many Things want to be corrected  Shall I give you a short Character of the Authors I have named  Horace  is always allowed the first Place Notwithstanding he slides over Things in a short easy careless Way scarce seeming to observe any Order yet he requires a great deal of Attention  Roscommon  's Translation of him is good though  Oldham  's loose Manner gives us most Pleasure This Author has also been translated by  Ben Jonson  and several others  Vida  stands next He does not meddle with the different Kinds of Poetry  only with Poetry in general and chiefly applies what he says to the  Epic  He is more full regular and methodical than any of them He points out how a Youth of Genius should be trained in the Art of Poetry and treats of many Things which none of the others whom I have named have touched upon all in such excellent Verse and so suited to the Nature of his Subjects that the Sound is in Reality "an Echo to the Sense" The Original is in Latin I am not certain whether he has been translated but will enquire if he has I will get him for you but at all Events you must compound for the Loss of his genuine Beauty  Boileau  is very judicious he takes in all Kinds of Poetry and borrows a great deal from  Horace  but is more methodical  Pope's Essay on Criticism  is a consummate Piece but it is so concise that like  Horace  he demands close Attention He borrows much from the three beforementioned  Roscommon  and the Duke of  Buckingham  are much shorter They omit many Things which the others mention but what they have written is finely executed The Duke of  Buckingham  insists most on Dramatic Writing What he has said though imperfect is very judicious and his Lines are masterly  On the whole I have one Piece of Advice for you namely that you would particularly observe what they have in common with each other By this Means you will be nearest to the right  No more till I hear from you which I hope will be soon but pray do not write when you are in a Hurry  I am  my dear  always yours J P  LETTER CV  Oxon  Sept    Dear Nancy  I Have on the other Leaf of this Letter sent you an Abstract of  Lord Roscommon's Essay on translated Verse  If you  will let the Abstract lye by you while you go through the Work itself it will assist you to distinguish one Rule from another and implant them still deeper in your Mind  This Author will particularly define  Tragedy  and  Comedy  and enable you to form a proper Judgment of them  I need not observe to you that the first general Qualification necessary in all Kinds of Writing is good Sense The peculiar Ingredients requisite for Tragedy are Terror and Pity those for Comedy are Wit and Humour  Corneille  thought to bring a fourth into Tragedy namely Admiration but it is not by any Means so essential as the former It will sometimes  have its Effect and act very agreeably on the Mind but Terror and Pity always have been and always will be allowed the main Ingredients  In like Manner Wit and Humour are necessary to Comedy The Preference between these is generally given to Humour and I think very justly If Humour is that peculiar Mode of thinking and of saying and doing Things which some Persons possess and are thereby distinguished from all others then it must be the chief Ingredient in Comedy Most People are endued with this Talent in a greater or less Degree and it is not uncommon to see the Happiness or Unhappiness of Life depend on this peculiar Cast of Mind and of Behaviour  Congreve  has an excellent Letter on Humour in Comedy Pray read it  Wit assuredly claims only the second Place Complaints have been made of too much Wit in some of our ComedyWriters in  Congreve  for Instance If any one merits the Charge he must be the Man but I am afraid it is generally rather false Wit or something mistaken for Wit which is complained of There are very few Authors however who can be arraigned of this Fault though I have heard  Terence  and  Wycherley  in the List with  Congreve  True Wit is hard to be defined Some call it merely a Propriety of Thoughts and Words but I think it rather is good  Sense well expressed Others term it an Assemblage of Ideas of very distinct and different Nature yet capable of being solved into an agreeable and unexpected Likeness  Congreve  's Comparison of Religion and Politics to Oil and Vinegar is an Instance in Point But I think this rather a Species than a Definition of Wit In my Opinion Wit consists in an ingenious Thought cloathed in good Phrase expressed with Liveliness and creative of Pleasure and Mirth  An ingenious and pleasant Friend of mine makes Translation the Test of Wit Will it says he still continue Wit if rendered into another Language If it will it is truly Witif not it is only Humour  If so it is an Essential to Comedy It recommends and enforces our Sentiments which howsoever just or important they may be  would otherwise too frequently make very slight Impressions Let us however not forget that it is a dangerous Weapon in the Hands of a Fool or a vicious Person for false Sentiments and  ad Doctrine thus seasoned might too generally prevail and mislead Persons of very right Dispositions More in my next  I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  P S  In reading the annexed Abstract  ou are to observe that many of the Author's Rules and Observations will serve  or Poetry in general as well as for  anslated Verse as will those of Mr  Pope  either for Poetry or Criticism Lord  Roscommon  has had  Horace Boileau  and  Vida  in his Eye but principally  Vida    Immortal Vida on whose honour'd Brow  The Poet's Bays and Critick's Ivy grow  POPE  LETTER CVI  Oxon  Sept    A Comedy with too much Wit in it has been compared to a Suit of Cloaths so richly embroidered as to prevent the GroundWork being seen I think however it is oftner Tinsel than Sterling of which we complain  It has been objected to  Congreve  that his very Servants and low Characters are  witty Why should they not be so Have we not seen such in real Life especially those who have acquired a little better Sort of Education  Jeremy  in his  Love for Love  is described to have waited on a Gentleman at  Cambridge  is there any Wonder such a Servant should be witty or such as are bred in or near  London  or in the Neighbourhood of the Court I do not see why they may not be as witty as their Betters as they often are  He is again charged with having written bad English He does so sometimes but puts it in the Mouth of a low Character He must be a weak Observer indeed who cannot distinguish between the Character and the Author  Mr  Pope  himself objects that Congreve's Fools are not Fools  How seldom do the best succeed  Tell me if Congreve's Fools are Fools indeed  In my humble Opinion Mr  Pope  should have considered that  Congreve  had declared and justly against bringing errant Fools on the Stage that is such as are created so Why for what End bring Persons there who ought rather to be pitied than exposed We might as justifiably reduce deaf or dumb People to Ridicule as such Fools as these Lord  Rochester  has an excellent Observation on this Head he says the Folly which deserves to be exposed is procured  by Expence of Time and Thought  God never made a Coxcomb worth a Groat  meaning to imply that Coxcombry must proceed from Vanity Pride Affectation or a wrong Taste  Congreve  complains that his  Witwou'd  in the  Way of the World  was mistaken by the Town for a  TrueWit  The Error was wholly theirs His Judgment was too nice to suffer him to draw gross Fools his were of a refined Cast and were Men who had the Appearance at least of something like Men of Sense Of this Sort are  Tattle Petulant Witwou'd  and  Brisk  though they are Fools enough at the Bottom but nevertheless are such to whom we should rather give the Appellation of Fops or Coxcombs  The Objection to  Congreve  that his Fools are not Fools enough is not half so bad as if they had been too much so Surely the Town would not have wished him to have brought either an Ideot or a Lunatick on the Stage He has indeed brought a CounterfeitMadman there and  Ben Johnson  a real Madman in his Comedy of  Bartholomew Fair  but not with an Intent to expose either the one or the other If we consider the Conduct of the Persons I have named from their first Entrance to the Time they leave the Stage we shall find them Fools enough in all Conscience  Petulant  and  Witwou'd  for Example can seldom be asunder they speak ill of one another when apart they play at Snip Snap and a rude Sort of bantering one another in Company  and even before Strangers They affect a strange Sort of Cant there is a kind of Pertness in all they say their Repartee is lively but silly and unmannerly they get drunk and come in that Pickle before their Mistress they fall into an absurd Fit of wrangling in which they both speak rank Nonsense they set up for being very severe upon the Ladies they give up their Pretensions to  Millamant  with as little Reason as they formed them in a Word they are a Couple of Coxcombs approaching towards Wit and Breeding but in Truth having neither Instead of good Sense polite Wit and genteel Repartee they have a sort of rude Briskness and  run the Rig  as the young Templars  and spruce Wits call this Sort of joking  This has diverted me from what I was going to say about Wit I will defer it till my next  I am  my dear Nancy  your affectionate Friend J P  P S  Your Letter is just now arrived but I have no Time to answer it till tomorrow  LETTER CVII  oxon  Sept    My dear Nancy  I Thought to have pursued the Subject of my last Letter two Days ago but had not Time I now proceed to enquire what Wit is and when it may be used with Propriety  Though I cannot give you a perfect Definition of Wit which perhaps is not to be done the Word being so variously applied yet I think we may define in what Shape it generally appears In the first Place Wit in my Opinion  is good Sense or at least it is founded in good Sense although there is something more necessary to constitute it for Example Jocoseness Sprightliness Ridicule but above all Aptness The Time and Manner of applying it makes great Part of the Merit  A good Pun passes for Wit with some Folks but I fear it is no Way allied to it A wild Expression carries the same Appearance with others but if there be not something ingenious in it as well as wild I doubt it will never deserve the Name of Wit  Wit appears often in a smart Repartee if made offHand Impromptu's  as the French call them These are very entertaining provided a fair Occasion offers and the Person who gives that Occasion deserves the Smart The Conversation between  Millamant  and  Marwood  in  the Way of the World  is a lively Instance hereof The former retorts on the latter with Abundance of Wit Humour and Satire  I will give you one Instance in a little Story where the Repartee was lively and severe and deserved and immediately took its Rise from what had been said  The famous  Judge Jefferies  was notable at confounding and browbeating Witnesses as they call it especially when  their Testimonies were not agreeable to him An old reverend Man with a great Beard was giving Evidence before him when  Jefferies  in Hope to put him out of Countenance said  If that Fellow's Conscience is as large as his Beard he may swear what he pleases  The Witness taking hold of his Beard gravely replied  Nay my Lord if you measure Consciences by Beards your Lordship has none at all  Thus introduced Repartee surely merits to be called Wit and is not only an agreeable but an useful Talent but when it is exercised against goodnatured inoffensive People or such as are in Want or Affliction it becomes detestable  and rather deserves the Name of Cruelty It is indeed as unmanly and cowardly in these Cases as it would be to assail with Violence one who had not a Weapon to defend himself or if he had who possessed neither Strength or Spirits to make Use of it And yet many such witty Fools are to be found who chuse to display their Talents on any Subject rather than lose an Opportunity of shewing them  Dr  Young  in his  Love of Fame  displays an honest Indignation at this cruel Use of Wit with great Energy  Who for the poor Renown of being smart  Would leave a Sting within a Brother's Heart  One Comfort is that they often feel the ill Effects themselves for Wit improperly placed is as apt to injure the Possessor as a Gun by recoiling to  bruise an injudicious Shooter Shall I illustrate this by another little Anecdote  A certain noble Roman was standing for one of their highest Offices the Consulship I believe The Election being popular the Candidates were obliged to court the Freemen as is practised in our Country at every Election for a Seat in Parliament All the Voters were caressed This Noble was shaking Hands with a poor labouring Man and perceiving them to be very hard "Friend" quoth he with a Sneer "dost thou walk upon thy Hands" The Man took the Witticism in Dudgeon and had Resentment and Interest enough to make the Noble lose his Election  The famous Sir  Thomas Sydenham  who was an extraordinary great Man in his Way had so indifferent an Opinion of Wit that he used to say "There was almost as great a Difference between Wisdom and Wit as between Something and Nothing" Yet I cannot agree with him Wit properly managed and tempered may be rendered as I said before an agreeable and useful Quality We should only take Care not to let it get the better of good Sense good Nature good Humour or good Manners  I am about to send you a Book which contains the Duke of  Buckingham  's and Lord  Roscommon  's Poems and the Archbishop of  Cambray  's Reflections on Eloquence  Boileau  's Art of Poetry a Translation from  Vida  and the Abstracts you desire shall accompany them Herewith you receive a Portion of  Pope  's Essay on Criticism but I wish you may be able to read it It was written in a Hurry and I have not present Leisure to transcribe it afresh  I am  my dear  yours J P  P S  I shall write again tomorrow or Sunday at farthest  LETTER CVIII  Oxon  Sept    WIT deals occasionally in various Figures of Speech for Example in Metonymy and Metaphor As you have now read  Longinus  I need not explain those Figures here  He had Wit who first called  useless Learning learned Lumber  A very learned Man has been termed a Magazine of Learning but if that Learning be confused and indigested they aptly say his Head is a LumberHouse of Learning  Religious Enthusiasts pretend to what they call  inward Light  as a Warrant to their Belief and Actions whence  Hudibras  says with great Wit  'Tis a dark Lanthorn of the Spirit  Which none see by but those that bear it  intimating that their pretended Light if it were useful at all was not so to any but themselves  But Wit deals most in Similies that is in drawing Likenesses between Things of a different Nature and the more surprizing and unexpected those Likenesses are and by how far the Things compared differ in their Kinds by so much more is the Wit prized There is one of this Kind in  Hudibras  which  has been much admired and often quoted Speaking of People who are truly loyal even in Disgrace and Affliction he says  For Loyalty is still the same  Whether it win or lose the Game  True as the Dial to the Sun  Altho' it be not shin'd upon  It is in Similies chiefly that most of our Poets who deal in Wit or pretend to it have run Riot What a Flood of them do we sometimes meet in Dramatic and other Writers introduced and pursued without Rhyme or Reason Every thing talked of is "like this" or "like that" Except a Simile be exceedingly well hit off it had better be unattempted Metonymy and Metaphor which are indeed  but concealed Similies are in my Opinion an easier and genteeler Conveyance of our Ideas  There is an admirable Sneer on these Strings of Similies which some Authors are so fond of in  Swift  's Introduction to  The Tale of a Tub  "Wisdom" says that admirable Writer  is a Fox who after long hunting will at last cost you the Pains to dig out It is a Cheese which by how much the richer has the thicker the homelier and the coarser Coat and whereof to a judicious Palate the Meggots are the best It is a SackPosset wherein the deeper you go you will find it the sweeter Wisdom is a Hen whose Cackling we must value and consider  because it is attended with an Egg But then lastly it is a Nut which unless you chuse with Judgment may cost you a Tooth and pay you with nothing but a Worm  Had  Swift  been in earnest in these Similies he would at best have appeared whimsically ridiculous but inasmuch as he meant them a Satire on SimileMongers in general he is most unquestionably witty and the whole Air and Turn of the Introduction being facetious nothing could be better suited to the Character of the Writer  An Author should therefore well confider in whose Mouth to put his Similies That will do well for one Person  which will by no Means suit another I suppose  Congreve  's Comparison of Religion and Politics to Oil and Vinegar to be as witty as ever was said on any Occasion yet because there is something wild in it he has properly put it into the Mouth of a Madman at least a Character that appears so  In the same Comedy  Jeremy  contrives to beguile  Tattle  and Mrs  Frail  into a Match with each other when each was on the Hunt for a Fortune elsewhere  Ben  a rough Sailor compares them hereon to a Couple of Privateers who were looking out for a Prize and fell foul of each other This is admirably humorous and witty in itself but derives double Beauty and Force from the Sailor's speaking it  I shall conclude this Letter with a Transcript from the famous Mr  Locke  where he treats of the Difference between Wit and Judgment  "If in having our Ideas in the Memory ready at Hand consists Quickness of Parts in this of having them unconfused and being able nicely to distinguish one Thing from another where there is but the least Difference consists in a great Measure the Exactness of Judgment and Clearness of Reason which is to be observed in one Man above another And perhaps hence may be given some Reason of that common Observation that Men who have a great deal of Wit and prompt Memories have not always the clearest Judgment or  deepest Reason For  Wit  lies most in the  Assemblage of Ideas  and putting these together with Quickness and Variety wherein can be found any Resemblance and Congruity thereby to make up pleasant Pictures and agreeable Visions in the Fancy  Judgment  on the contrary lies quite on the other Side in separating carefully one from another Ideas wherein can be found the least Difference thereby to avoid being misled by Similitude and by Affinity to take one Thing for another  "This is a Way of proceeding quite contrary to Metaphor and Allusion wherein for the most Part lies that Entertainment and Pleasantry of  Wit  which strikes so lively on the Fancy and therefore so acceptable to all People because its Beauty appears at first Sight and there is required no Labour of Thought to examine what Truth or Reason there is in it The Mind without looking any further rests satisfied with the Agreeableness of the Picture and the Gaiety of the Fancy and it is a kind of Affront to go about to examine it by the severe Rules of Truth and good Reason whereby it appears that it consists in something that is not perfectly conformable to them"  I would have you my dear Nancy consider attentively this Distinction between Wit and Judgment It is the best philosophical  Account of them that ever I met though perhaps this Definition does not reach to Wit in its utmost Extent at least in the Sense of the Word as used at present and thence comes it so hard to be defined or described Mr  Locke  himself seems indeed somewhat sensible of this for he you perceive always speaks with a sort of Exception and Doubt as  in a great Measureperhaps for the most part  c c  I believe I shall have something more for you on this Subject the next Time I write and then I shall quit it  I have bespoke  Vida  for you in English and all  Pope  's Epistles in Verse among which are his Imitations from  Horace  They shall come with the Books I mentioned in my last  I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  LETTER CIX  Oxon  Oct    My dear Nancy  I Received yours of the th of last Month with which I am very well pleased I hope you have received one from me dated on the same Day with yours In my last I exhausted almost every thing I had to say on the Topic  of Wit and Humour I shall only add that after all that can be said of them they can only be considered as the Seasoning of Comedy The great Standard of all is good Sense with Discernment Judgment and a thorough Knowledge of Mankind  These must appear in the Plot Construction and Conduct of a Play in the Sentiments in the Manners in the Characters and in the Propriety of the Diction our Vices our Affections and Passions our Humours Weaknesses and Follies as well as their Contraries ought to be well understood coloured and expressed Then all are to be seasoned with Wit and Humour in an easy and just Manner  As for the Unities of Action Time and Place which the Antients insist upon so strongly especially that of Action the best that can be said in their Behalf in my Opinion is that it is better to have them than be without them for a Play if it is not good in itself will not become so for the Unities being ever so religiously observed We have many Plays extant where they are all kept to the utmost Nicety and yet the Pieces altogether are not worth a Perusal  There are also Dramatic Productions wherein the Rules are wholly set aside which are the Admiration of every Reader of the most refined Taste Our inimitable  Shakespeare  stands an Example of this against all the cold Observers of Accuracy that ever did or ever will exist  Pray read what  Longinus  says of  Plato  and  Lysias Demosthenes  and  Hyperides Ion  and  Sophocles  As you have  Horace's Art of Poetry  I shall send you an Abstract of it in my next which I could wish you would compare carefully with the Poem itself as you go through it  I hope to hear from you soon I have no Time for a longer Letter at present My most humble Service to your Mama and Aunt  I am  dear Nancy  yours J P  LETTER CX  Oxford  Oct    My dear Nancy  I Have the Pleasure of yours of the th and am pleased with it You enter into the Subject spiritedly and your Remarks are just  I have collected all your Books namely  Roscommon  's and  Buckingham's  Essays  Boileau Vida Pope's  Epistles from  Horace  c These last are sent to be newbound and the ArchBishop of  Cambray  on Eloquence As these together with  Aristotle  's Art of Poetry and  Longinus  which you have already will give yo just Ideas and form your Taste so  LeFaucheur  will give you a right Notion of Pronunciation He is said to be the best who ever wrote on that Point He is greatly commended by those two famous Men  Bayle  and  Le Clerc  I have got him for you in English but I could not get him in French It seems the Translator did not know who wrote the Original but I well know it was  LeFaucheur  I think you ought to consider him well  Aristotle  may perhaps seem somewhat hard and tedious at first but he is worth much Time and Labour He is the great Original that all the Rest have followed Use your Patience but  if on such Trial you find him require too much Attention lay him aside till you become a little older Whenever you are acquainted with him you will find him the true Master of true Criticism  All these Books shall be sent you one Day this Week and you shall have previous Notice I have some Business which will engage me for two Days so you may not hear from me till Wednesday or Thursday next  My humble Service to your Mama and Aunt  Adieu  my dear Nancy  Your's J P  LETTER CXI  Oxford  Oct    Dear Nancy  I Have just now received yours of the th I have a troublesome and tedious Job on my Hands yet I will set it aside a Moment to answer your Question about  Terence  The Sense the Conduct Characters Sentiments and Diction of this Author I am speaking of the Original are wonderfully fine but the great  Julius Caesar  complained that he wanted the  Vis Comica  that is translated literally  the comic Force or Strength  I presume  Caesar  meant  Humour  and in that he assuredly fell infinitely short of  Plautus  who alone is the other comic Poet of  Rome  that is left us  I am entirely of your Opinion in Regard to the two Plays you mention  The Squire of Alsatia  is a Disgrace to the Drama to Letters common Sense and common Decency and yet there have been Audiences found to encourage the Representation  The Hint of the  Plain Dealer  is evidently taken from the  Misantrope  of  Moliere  but there is a great Exception to this Comedy in Point of Decorum which is to be much lamented when we  consider the vast Fund of Wit wherewith it abounds  You will have all your Books by  Bew  's Coach on  Wednesday  next My Service at Home  I am  my dear  yours J P  LETTER CXII  Oxon  Oct    My dear Nancy  I Have sent the Books according to Promise  Herewith you have a short Abstract of  Vida's  Art of Poetry If any Part  appears unintelligible the Poem itself will clear it up To that I refer you I have already given my Reasons why I send Extracts from a Poem which you have at Hand  I will be more particular as to those Reasons that you may be very clear in my Meaning  You may perhaps think that I might have spared myself the Pains of transcribing and you the Pains of reading these Abstracts But in my Opinion they will be of some and even of more Use than if you had not the Books All the Heads are but short Hints and Items which would be of little Service without the Authors at  large The Authors explain and enforce what is in my little Abridgments and those very Abridgments impress deeper in your Mind what the Author has said They reciprocally aid each other The Abstracts serve yet further to sort the different Heads and Precepts and to range them in order so that you may thereby obtain a distinct and welldisposed View of them all at once  You shall next have an Abstract from  Boileau  These are all to be read with great Care and I must warn you that there are several Errors in the Printing especially in  Pope  's Epistles and in the Essays of  Buckingham  and  Roscommon  Those you must notice and correct as they occur  Faucheur  is an excellent Book As I told you formerly I am not for your setting up for a Critick but I would have you attain to a just Idea of the Nature and Excellencies of fine Writting and to form a right Judgment towards which it is with great Pleasure that I contribute from time to time such Assistance as lies within my poor Ability Write to me on Receipt of the Box  I am with Service to your Mama and Aunt  my dear Nancy  yours affectionately J P  P S  Although  Vida  treats only of the Epic Poem he has many useful Rules which are applicable to every other Species of Poetry  LETTER CXIII  Oxon  Oct    My dear Nancy  I Hope you have received your Books safe and found the Letter which was with them in the Box  I here send you an Abstract of  Boileau  's Art of Poetry as I did of  Vida  there I have two or three Things to recommend to you in reading these Authors  In the first Place you should consider the great Rules on which the Rest depend and which are laid down by all or at least the major Part of these Critics These great Rules may be thus comprehended  Good Sense is the Foundation of all good Writing  Chuse Subjects fit for your Genius  Never depart from Nature  In the next Place observe such Rules as are in few or but in one of these Authors These are more likely to escape your View and therefore should be more carefully searched for and attended to  You should not run over these Rules carelessly and in a cursory Manner but deliberately both with Attention and Application  Sometimes reflect at Leisure upon one Rule or Head sometimes upon another and endeavour to account to yourself for the Reason of such Rule If you cannot clearly satisfy yourself ask some Person or write to me It may be no unprofitable nor unpleasant Diversion to enter on a Disquisition of that Kind  One Caution by the Bye Do not load your Head with all these Rules lumbered together in a confused indigested Heap but strive to understand them clearly and minutely by a patient  and leisurely Attention and you will reap the Fruit of them in due Time  When you cannot see quite through the Reason of any Proposition and yet are desirous to account for it by yourself rather suspend your Search than remain content with a poor imperfect Solution of the Difficulty of all Things never rest satisfied with Absurdities which many Persons are too apt to do some from Oversight some from mere Laziness Such Errors are attended with a double Disadvantage In the first Instance no Progress is made in our Studies in the next the Time is lost which might have been employed to some Purpose  The Books which I have sent you have I believe many Errata or MisPrintings in them a due Observation of the Advice given above will not only enable you to discover those but also to supply the true Meaning of the Author  Remember that next to Epic Poetry Tragedy and Comedy are the great Species of Writing Tragedy indeed is itself a Species of the  Epic  I do not recommend them to you merely that you should  read Plays  according to the Acceptation of dissipated People who pass or rather waste an idle Hour over what they neither comprehend nor retain but as  moral Treatises  for no dramatic Works but what have this Tendency  answer the Ends they were designed for or are worth your Attention  I could wish you would improve yourself in reading it is a nice Art and known but to few You promise I think to excel in it When engaged in a Poem you would do well to repeat aloud sometimes It is of Service to the Breath if not done to Excess and will be of great Use for many Errors will be discovered by the Ear that are come at by no other Means For the Rules of Pronunciation  Le Faucheur  is the best Instructor extant among the Moderns  But all these Rules however well understood will be of small Use without  knowing the great Models from which these Rules are drawn you should therefore read the best Authors in the different Sorts of Poetry  The Antients lay down these three Things necessary to perfect us in any Science first  Artthat is Precept or Rule  Imitation that is an Endeavour to study the best Models and follow their Manner and  Exercitationnamely Practice  Vida  as you may observe is the most regular of all these Essayists His first Book is on  Invention or the Provision of Matter  the next is  The Disposition or Wellordering of that Matter  the third is  The Beautifying and Adorning of that Matter  These are the three great Points to be observed not only in Poetry but in Oratory and in almost every Art and Science as Painting Sculpture Building  c  I am  my dear Nancy  your affectionate Friend J P  LETTER CXIV  Oxon  Oct    My Dear  I Received yours of the d and answered it forthwith but have kept the Answer by me having been in hourly Expectation of a Recruit of Franks and they are but now arrived You have neglected to notice one or two Circumstances which I enquired about I wish you would always place the Letter before you which you are about to answer and answer Correspondents as soon as you can after you hear from them What you thus say while the Feelings are  and lively though contained in six Lines alone is worth a whole Volume that is damped by the Coldness of Delay  I never read  Cleveland  but am told it is an excellent Book and shews  les Plis et les Replis de Coeur humain  very agreeably and accurately  I think you should read  Vida  first very carefully then  Horace  next to him  Boileau  then  Pope  's Criticism  Buckingham  and  Roscommon  progressively The Archbishop of  Cambray  and  LeFaucheur  may come in last  Such Particulars as are treated by more than one of them ought to be compared after you have gone through the Authors  For Example I would have you collect and compare all they have said upon Epic Poetry together upon Ode Satire Tragedy and Comedy and when you have Leisure write a sort of Abridgment of them for your own Use  You should make yourself a perfect Mistress of the principal Figures of Speech such as Metaphor Simile Allegory Metonymy Irony  c Congreve  's Letter on Humour is a most admirable Piece The Preface or Introtion to  Joseph Andrews  about Ridicule is well worth considering  Fielding  is an excellent Judge of Nature and Mankind  Congreve  's Epistle to Sir  Richard Temple  on Affectation and another under the Name of  Cobham  are equally excellent  I am heartily sorry you do not understand Latin on many Accounts among the rest that you cannot read  Vida  in the Original Though the Translation must be allowed pretty good yet there is no coming up to the Beauties of the Author's Lines  If I mistake not  Cleveland  is a Romance there may perhaps be some Truth in it but I never read nor heard of a natural Son of  Cromwell  's under that Name which had the Story been true must have been known long before now  I am  my dear Nancy  your faithful and affectionate Friend J P  LETTER CXV  Oxon  Oct    My dear Nancy  I Received yours of the th in due Course I have written to you on so many Subjects that I am almost exhausted and latterly you have not entered into what I have said sufficiently to give me a Handle for proceeding It is true I cannot but admit your Excuse in Part to wit your having so much to do during your Mother's Indisposition Your Attion to her must create you full Employment and you are right not to let any Consideration interrupt that pious Care  I most heartily acquit you from the Use of Pen and Ink till you are at better Leisure and will in the mean Time endeavour to give you Amusement  I thought to have said something about Figures in Writing but you now have  Longinus  and  Vida  who explain them much better than I can  In a Letter I wrote you lately I observed there is a great deal of Satire in true Comedy I have now to add that there is a great deal of Irony in Satire This is a very extensive Figure and converts itself into many Shapes Sometimes it is direct pointed and sharp sometimes it appears in the Shape of Praise It occasionally counterfeits Love Pity  Fear in short what not Sometimes it lurks in Metaphor Allegory Comparison Fable  c  Dr  Swift  has varied it so many Ways and all so naturally and pleasantly that the Study of his Works especially  The Tale of a Tub  and the Pieces bound up with it gives us a better Idea of true Irony in all its Branches than any Description is capable of affording  The Tale of a Tub  has represented the Fopperies and Absurdities of the Roman Catholic Tenets more glaringly than the gravest Discourse in the World could have done and that under a Story taken from common Life In that Author's other Works he has exposed an hundred Follies in so droll a Manner that they strike  us in that Way beyond the Power of the most solemn Essay or Declamation How has he exposed all Kinds and Degrees of VainGlory and Affectation by imitating the very Fault he is exposing In how contemptible and just a Light has he placed the Custom of punning of talking always proverbially and all idle Discourse in his  Polite Conversation  In short it is needless to say more than that the whole Art of Ridicule is to be learned from Swift  The only Addition I have to make to this Subject is to quote you one Instance of Irony from the Holy Scriptures which I think as strong and as just as any I ever read It is in Ridicule of the Priests of  Baal  who was a false God an Idol  and no more His Priests invoked him to perform a Miracle  Elijah  mocketh them The Reasons which he assigns for their God not answering their Intercessions are the severest Piece of Raillery imaginable  "Cry aloud" says he  for he is a God either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is on a Journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked  All which Charges being so unworthy of a God the Raillery is conceived in its full Force the Moment the Prophet opens his Mouth and must be understood by the most ordinary Capacity The whole Chapter is worth your reading  It is the th of the first Book of  Kings  I do not recollect if I ever mentioned to you the th Chapter of  Isaiah  If I did you have not noticed it in any of your Letters if I did not I now recommend it to you It is admirable as far as respects the Subject itself but the Disposition of the Chapter the Repetitions the Emphasis and Energy and the many Figures introduced make it admirably worth your Notice The Chapter is still more excellent inasmuch as it is full of strong Figures yet appears exceedingly simple and plain This is the great Beauty of Diction when the Figures are so naturally brought in that  we feel their Effect before we perceive them They strike unseen  Dryden  says  Figures ought to be worked into a Discourse as if they were Part of the Tissue itself not embossed upon it  The Allusion is excellent and the Observation just  I am  my dearest  yours J P  LETTER CXVI  Oxon  Nov    Dear Nancy  I Have yours of the third of this Month You have not yet entered into any of the late Subjects I wrote to you about but your former Excuse I presume still exists and it is too strong to be opposed  It is not material whether you ever read  Polite Conversation  again or no the Moral of that Satire is too obvious to require much Attention it being designed only to ridicule the insipid Conversation  that passes too ordinarily among the most fashionable People And can it well be wondered at when so little Attention is paid to the Education of Children whether Male or Female in higher Life  To qualify them for Company  such is the fashionable Phrase is the chief Object of Parents in that Style that is to make a Bow dance a Minuet and play at Cards The two first I acknowledge to be agreeable and even necessary Qualifications provided they are accompanied with something intrinsic But while so much Care is employed in gracing the Outside surely some little might be used in cultivating the Mind Perhaps  Master  is sent to some public Seminary and  Miss  to a BoardingSchool at both which Places I am sorry to say the moral Part  of Education is the last attended to if it be at all They are quickly launched into Life poor Souls and possibly to the most important State of Life Matrimony as FamilyPurposes and Interests lead or rather too often mislead without a single Idea to bless themselves with or even knowing that there is such a Thing as a  Mind  to inspire and regulate their earthly Composition  The Reason for calling  The Tale of a Tub  by that Name is I think pretty plain We call any idle romantic Story  A Tale of a Tub  and if this Story of  Swift  's were to be taken in a literal Sense none ever more justly deserved the Name  I would have you look often on the Abstract of  Vida  while you are reading him Besides the Beauty of his Stile the Worth Weight and Importance of his Subject besides these I say the Order Disposition and Method of his Poem is admirable preferable in my Opinion to all the rest  You should read  Boileau  with great Care and make the same Use of your Abstracts with them all Have you yet got a thorough Conception of the principal Figures in Rhetoric and Poetry the chief I mean which I pointed out to you I hope to have an Answer to this Question soon and your Observations on those Passages in the Holy Scriptures which I recommended Your Letters  are always acceptable and entertaining my dear Nancy to  your ever affectionate J P  P S  I wish you would mention the Dates of my Letters when you acknowledge the Receipt of them  LETTER CXVII  Oxon  Nov    My dear Nancy  I Have the Pleasure of yours of the th You say there are some Figures which you do not in any wise understand Add to  Longinus Vida  's Discourse on this Point in his third  Book and you must acquire a due Notion of the principal Figures or Tropes both in Poetry and Rhetoric Metaphor is the chief of all and even the principal Figures next to Metaphor are but Species or Branches of it  A Metaphor is the Use of a Word in a borrowed Sense The principal Properties and Uses of it are  First to express Things for which we have not suitable Words or Phrases  Secondly to express them so strongly as to convey deep and agreeable Impressions  Thirdly to give us the Representation and Resemblance of two Things at once  In short it is like a Picture where the Resemblance to the Thing painted gives us the chief Pleasure  Near the Beginning of the third Book of  Vida  's Art of Poetry there is this glorious Description of Metaphor  See how the Poet banishes with Grace  A native Term to give a Stranger Place  From diff'rent Images with just Success  He cloaths his Matter in the borrow'd Dress  The borrow'd Dress the Things themselves admire  And wonder whence they drew the strange Attire  Proud of their ravish'd Spoils they now disclaim  Their former Colour and their genuine Name  And in another Garb more beauteous grown  Prefer the foreign Habit to their own  After producing some beautiful Instances where the Metaphor is thus happily introduced he proceeds and illustrates his Sentiment with a Simile which deserves our highest Admiration  Pleased with the borrow'd Charms the Readers find  A Crowd of diff'rent Images combin'd  Rise from a single Object to the Mind  So the pleas'd Trav'ller from a Mountain's Brow  Views the calm Surface of the Seas below  Tho' wide beneath the floating Ocean lies  The first immediate Object of his Eyes  He sees the Forests tremble from within  And gliding Meadows paint the Deeps with green  While to his Eyes the fair Delusions pass  In gay Succession thro' the watry Glass  We have no adequate Words in our Language to express the Intenseness of Love or the Extravagance of any violent Passions for which Reason it is very common to make use of Metaphor in our usual Discourse for Example we  burn  with Lovewe are  inflamed  with Rage  c  We say of a Man who is of a kind Disposition that he has a  warm  Heart of one otherwise disposed that he has a  cold  or a  hard  Heart We  melt  into Tears we  sink  with Grief we  swell  with Anger our Hearts  leap  with  Joy  we  die  with Fear and so on  Virgil  describing  Dido  concealing her Love says  She  feeds  within her Veins a Flame unseen  In the Holy Scriptures these metaphorical Expressions are frequently met God  hides  his Face or  shines  upon us  viz  Hide  thy Face from my Sins and  blot  out all my Misdeeds  Let thy Mercy  shine  upon us  Lift up the  Light  of thy Countenance upon us  In other Instances where we use Metaphors to express Things with more Strength and make a deeper Impression for a  dull  Discourse we say a  cold lifeless  Discourse A Poet instead of telling us the SideBoard  was filled  with Plate says  The SideBoard  groan'd  with Plate  Metaphor is sometimes used to bring the Thing from which it is borrowed before our Eyes that we may enjoy the Beauty of the Similitude  Cowley  says  The beechen Bowl  foams  with a  Flood  of Wine  and  Pope  A  Tide  of Trojans  flow  and fill the Place  What a beautiful Resemblance is this It not only presents us with the Idea of a great Crowd breaking into an Intrenchment but likewise with that of a raging Sea breaking over its Banks and to add to both conveys the perfect Resemblance which each bears to the other  Sometimes the Metaphor of a Metaphor is made use of for Example we  usually call a  dull  Preacher a  heavy  Preacher  Pope  carries this Word  heavy  which in itself is a Metaphor to a Metaphor beyond it where he says in his new  Dunciad  leaden Gilbert  preach'd Heavy  is a metaphorical Expression for  dull  and  leaden  for  heavy  I will trouble you no further till I know whether you chuse I should thus proceed to perfect you in the Knowledge of Figures if you do I shall bring you acquainted with the rest of the metaphorical Family their Relations and Descendants  I am  my dear Nancy  yours very truly J P  P S  I know you will drink my Health tomorrow  LETTER CXVIII  Oxford  Nov    My Dear  YOU cannot conceive how much you have pleased me in submitting to so unentertaining a Subject for a Letter rather than be without Instruction It is but undergoing a little disagreeable Labour now to reap the Pleasure hereafter for that you certainly will and without a thorough Knowledge of the Grounds of Rhetorick the most elegant Author or Orator can never take a proper Possession of you  You ask in your last about Polyptotes and Gradations I shall therefore make them the Subject of this Letter  Their ordinary Names are  Polyptoton  and  Climax  which are both Greek Words I need not here insert what  Longinus  says of them but refer you to him I shall only observe that beside the Substitution of one Number or Tense for another which is the  Polyptoton  or rather the Licence of so doing there is often great Beauty in it especially in the Greek and Latin Languages and chiefly in the former owing to the Variety of Terminations in their Verbs and Nouns The French Language too exceeds ours in this particular  though it falls very short of the other two  That you may clearly understand what I mean take the following Example in French  Si vous m'aviez aim√© autant que je vous aime je vous aimerois mieux que Personne mais vouliez vous que je vous aimasse quand vous ne m'aimiez pas  Do you not here perceive a beautiful Variety in the Persons and Tenses Take the same in English and you will discover a total Want of it  If you had loved me as well as I love you I would have loved you better than any Person but would you  have had me love you when you did not at all love me  Here you see nothing but  love  and  loved  all along and this I presume explains what I mean  The Climax is a noble and beautiful Figure when managed without Affectation We ascend from one Step to another building as it were something on something laid down before till we come to the great Point at which we aim I will give you two Instances one on a ludicrous the other on a solemn Subject How excellently is the Tumult and Confusion increased in the Poem of the  Alley  which I sent you some Time since from a Girl's Whimpering  to a Boy's roaring Dogs barking Vixens scolding and Swine grunting Again How beautiful is the Gradation of Distress in  Congreve  's  Pastora  No more the Nymphs shall with soft Tales delight  Her Earsno more with Dances please her sight  Nor ever more shall Swain make Song of Mirth  To bless the joyous Day that gave her Birth  Lost is that Day which had from her its Light  For ever lost with her in endless Night  In endless Night and Arms of Death she lies  Death in eternal Shades has shut Pastora's Eyes  This Figure you may observe by the foregoing Example is generally accompanied by Repetition I will add one more Instance from the great  Tillotson  not only to illustrate this Figure which indeed it does to an Excellency but also  for the Beauty Justness and Utility of the Observation  After we have practised good Actions a while they become easy and when they are easy we begin to take Pleasure in them and when they please us we do them frequently and by Frequency of Acts a Thing grows into a Habit and a confirmed Habit is a second Kind of Nature and so far as any Thing is natural so far it is necessary and we can hardly do otherwise nay we do it many Times when we do not think of it  You will observe that this great Master of Eloquence avoids repeating the same Word too literally but uses a Sort of Variation to give a greater Beauty to  his Discourse and to avoid seeming affected to which Censure an exact Repetition would probably have exposed him  The Omission of Copulatives adds much Grace to a Discourse on some Occasions particularly in Haste or Passion for Instance  Gorunflybe quick  c and on others great Beauty is derived from their being multiplied The Quotation I have already made from the ArchBishop wherein the Word  and  is found no less than six Times renders it unnecessary to seek further for an Example  I may probably take another Opportunity to enlarge somewhat further on  these two opposite Figures I hope to see you about Christmas  J P  P S  After finishing the above my Dear yours of Yesterday came to Hand and is there answered I thank God I am very well and drank your Health your Mama's and Aunt's on the fourteenth as you did mine Your Letter gives me much Pleasure  Encore adios ma chere  LETTER CXIX  Oxford  Nov    My dear  AS you now understand a Metaphor I shall say no more on that Head but consider the Figures which  are near akin to it These are Metonymy Synecdoche Hyperbole Irony Simile Allegory Fable and Catachresis  Before I proceed let me transcribe a Passage out of  Blackwell  's new Introduction to the Classics with a little Addition You may get Acquaintance with this odd Family through his Means I dare say He is intimate with them  There is a general Analogy and Relationship between all Tropes and in all of them we use a foreign or strange Word instead of one that is proper Hence we sometimes say one Thing and mean another quite different but this is not always the Cafe These  Tropes like other Relations in Life are some nearer some farther removed  When we advance one Thing and then say some other which has a near Affinity to it it is a Synecdoche  When we say one Thing and mean another mutually depending it is a Metonymy  When we say one Thing and mean the very opposite it is Irony  When we say one Thing and mean another like to it it is a Metaphor  A Metaphor long continued is an Allegory  An Allegory turned into a Story is called a Fable and in the ScriptureLanguage is a Parable  When a Metaphor is carried into a great Degree of Boldness it is an Hyperbole and when it is farfetched or carries some Impropriety in it 'tis a Catachresis  The Metaphor is the Source and Fountain of them all and lies chiefly in Verbs  Metonymy lies most in Nouns and this is the best Distinction I can make between them  To exemplify the latter We call a wise Man a  Cato  or a  Solomon  a strong Man a  Hercules  a handsome Youth  an  Adonis  a fine Woman a  Venus  or an  Angel  The Instance is preserved too between rational Creatures and Brutes A rude Fellow is termed a Bear a bold Fellow a Lyon "Go tell that  Fox"  c says our  Saviour  speaking of  Herod  who was a cunning supple fawning Prince  Again between animate and inanimate Beings a fine Woman is a  Jewel  a  Rose  a  Lilly  "Our God" says the Prophet "is a consuming  Fire"  "I am the  Vine"  declares our Saviour and even names himself by Appellations of Qualities and Virtues as well as by those of inanimate Beings  viz  "I am the  Way"  "the  Truth"  "the  Life"  Rivers are often named to imply the Country through which they pass especially if they be the chief Rivers as in a Line of  Prior  Her Warriors  Anna  sends from  Tweed  and  Thames"  To use a Metonymy properly we should start a new Thought else it is to no Purpose for why should we Call any one a  Sir Francis Wronghead  unless we design to paint him under that Character If  Prior  had meant  Tweed  and  Thames  in a proper Sense there would have been no Meaning in the Expression at all  The Figure Synecdoche is defined by a Part being placed for the Whole  as  "My dear Heart"  The Romans said  My dear Head Honest Heart Honest Breast  c It is again seen when the Containing is used for the Contained as  Drink  this GlassEat of this  Dish  The whole  Theatre  burst into Tears  Greece  was in Confusion  Africa  was in ArmsThe  Rhine  and  Danube  made their Submissions to  Caesar  Again when Plurals are used for Singulars As if a veteran Actor should say Your  Quins  and your  Cibbers  were not comparable to the  Bettertons  and  Barrys  of the former Age  This Figure is used both to extoll and depreciate as you will easily discern Great Judgment is required in the Management of this and indeed of all  Nothing is more ridiculous than a Figure illplaced  There is a Passage in  Claudian  so excellent that I must insert it You will discover in it the Metaphor the Metonymy the Synecdoche and the Hyperbole It loses a great Deal of its Beauty to be sure when stripped of the Original Language where it runs thus  Maduerunt  Saxone  fuso  Orcades  incaluit  Pictorum  Sanguine  Thule Scotorum  Cumulos flevit glacialis  Ierne  This literally translated is  The  Orkneys  were drenched the  Saxon  being overthrown  Thule  grew warm with the Blood of the  Picts  and the icy River  Ierne  mourned in Tears the Heaps of the  Scots  that were slain  In my next I shall go through the other Tropes and shew you the Difference between what is called a Trope and what a Figure In the mean Time I leave it to you to find out where the Beauties of the abovecited Passage of  Claudian  lye  Adieu  J P  LETTER CXX  Oxon  Dec    My dear Nancy  I Have not heard from you since  Sunday  last so not having any Thing to answer I shall resume my Discourse where I left off  I shall not make any Mention of Irony as you understand it sufficiently nor need I say much of Hyperbole It is only an Exaggeration of Things beyond the Reality to make a deeper Impression or to give us a stronger Idea of what is meant to be conveyed to the Mind We often run naturally into this as indeed all Figures have their Source from our Passions and Sensibilities How common is it to say  sweeter than Honey whiter than Snow  when in Truth we mean no more than to say  very  sweet and  very  white  An Hyperbole like Irony appears in the Shape of other Figures sometimes in Similies as  like the Snow for Whiteness  and there are Degrees in the Hyperbole  as in the Simile for speaking of any antient Custom we often say  as old as the Creation  and when we would raise the Comparison higher we say  older than the Creation  This Figure is noble when judiciously used but when improperly it is harsh uncouth and degenerates into a Catachresis There are so many noble Hyper+boles in  Homer  and  Virgil  and particularly in the Holy Writings that it is needless to quote them  A bold Metaphor becomes an Hyperbole a strong extravagant Hyperbole becomes a Catachresis and even in this there is some Beauty when introduced with Judgment  A Metaphor and Hyperbole are sometimes softened by a Comparison and there is a Manner of expressing that Comparison whereby not only the two first Figures but even the third itself is softened and this is sometimes necessary to be contrived to avoid Expressions which otherwise would be too strong  All these shall be spoken of in their due Places but I shall confine the Remainder of this Letter solely to the Hyperbole  In the first Place an Hyperbole may be direct as  The Giant's Head o'ertopp'd the Clouds  and the Beauty of the Image presented and Manner of the Description frequently  set off this Figure and totally conceal the Extravagance of the Fancy  Virgil  gives us an Example of this in the ninth Book of his  Aeneid  near the End He tells us  Camilla  Outstripp'd the Winds in Speed upon the Plain  Flew o'er the Fields nor hurt the bearded Grain  She swept the Seas and as she skimm'd along  Her flying Feet unbath'd on Billows hung  This Passage is very beautiful as  Dryden  has rendered it but it is ten Times more so in the Original  Virgil  says  She could have slown along the uppermost Tops of a Field of Corn uncut nor have hurt the tender Stalks in her Course or she could have taken her Way through the Middle of the  Sea raised high with swelling Billows nor so much as dipped the Soles of her swift Feet in them  This is a literal Translation but no Description can reach the Beauties of the Original Observe the pleasing Metaphors of  flying  instead of  running fast  of  hurting  the Grain instead of  treading it down  and the Word which I have rendered  dipp'd  is in the Latin  tingeret  and conveys less than  dipping  it implies no more than  wetting  or  tincturing  An Hyperbole in the next Place may be indirect as in a Comparison thus  It seems as if the  Cyclades  again  Were rooted up and justled in the Main  Or floating Mountains floating Mountains meet  Such was the first Encounter of the Fleet  Aeneid Book viii near the End  When Hyperboles are very strong the Subject or the Object at the instant the Hurry Heat and Passion ought not only to deserve but even to require them  I shall conclude this Letter with one Example from the Holy Scriptures where the Boldness of the Figure in my Opinion exceeds every thing of that Kind which can any where be found and surely the Occasion not only requires but commands it I think it is the Prophet  Isaiah  who speaking of poor Mortals in Comparison with the infinitely great and powerful God says  We are as Nothing yea less than Nothing in thy Sight  Does not this strike us with a prodigious Idea of the infinite Disproportion between  God  and us  Though these Figures are easily understood yet it requires much Nicety and Attention to discover how when and where they are to be applied what Degree of Force or Abatement is to be used in the Application and how they should be dressed out for the Purpose  I am  my dear  yours J P  LETTER CXXI  Oxon  Dec    Dear Nancy  YOU observe very truly that if the Word  as  were taken out from the Passages of the Canticles which you quoted they would be still more beautiful and indeed it is not in the Original You see the  as  is in Italick Characters which is constantly used when Words that were not in the Original are added to make the Sense more intelligible or to suit the warm Expressions of the Oriental Language to the Coldness of ours  The Simile or Comparison is a Figure easily comprehended but a skilful Person alone knows how and when to use it One general and unerring Caution belongs to this as well as to the other Tropes akin to it namely that Baseness or Meanness Impropriety Loathsomeness Obscenity and Prophaneness are to be avoided A low and unworthy Comparison should never interfere with a grand Subject  Homer  is blamed for this in many Instances I shall mention only one to wit where he compares  Ajax  to an  Ass  I refer you to what  Vida  had advanced in his Disfavour and  Pope  in his Defence There is however great Propriety in the Comparison that lies in the Action or Behaviour of the one and the other on the Occasions that  Homer  mentions  though not in the Person of  Ajax  and the  Ass  but even the Introduction of them any how in a Likeness together or presenting the Idea of one with the other seems to debase the Thing compared  Virgil  says  Vida  would never have done this and indeed we find him delicate in his Applications and ever studiously cautious to avoid low and gross Comparisons  There is a most disgustful Simile in one of  Pope  's Epistles about  Westphalia  Hogs nothing but the Loathsomeness of the Vice he is decrying and his Design of making it detestable can excuse it  Prophane Comparisons shock People of Virtue as much as People of Breeding  I will give you one Instance which I have many Times heard with Pain When any one has talked or acted in an unintelligible or unaccountable Manner I have heard a Pretender at Wit exclaim  Oh that's like the Peace of  God  it passeth all Understanding  alluding prophanely to the Benediction at the End of the CommunionService Words and Phrases which have been sanctified and consecrated in an especial Manner to religious Purposes ought not idly to be played with and scoffed at Some Persons were so warm in the RevolutionInterest that they called  King William  the  Saviour  of the Nation It is true there was no actual Harm in this but another Term might have been found and with a better Grace while we have so constant  and material an Idea devoted to the Word  Saviour  Pope  has been blamed by some Persons for calling  Agamemnon King of Kings  that Appellation having been so solemnly consecrated to  God  in the  Revelations  and elsewhere in the Holy Writings  We are not to expect a Comparison should hit in every Particular it is enough if the Thing to which we allude agree with the Thing compared in the principal Point or Points that we intend to illustrate  A short Comparison is easily turned into a Metaphor but where it runs into a Length of Circumstances it is impossible  to do it For Example when  Virgil  in the twelfth Book of the  Aeneid  compares  Aeneas  and  Turnus  in the Heat of the Battle to two Torrents rushing down a Precipice and laying every thing waste before them and again near the End of the Book where he likens the same Heroes  Turnus  flying and  Aeneas  pursuing to a Deer and a Hound the Particulars are so many and the Illustration so extensively beautiful that it would not be comprized within the Compass of a Metaphor  Where the Metaphor would be too hard or obscure then a Simile is necessary for Instance it would have been uncouth in  Homer  to have called  Hector a sudden Night  or  a snowy Mountain  in  the one Place therefore he says  he came on the Greeks  like  sudden Night  which creates a strong Idea of Terror and in the other  "like  a snowy Mountain" from his Figure being so conspicuous and his shining Arms  Let me here digress a Moment and raise your Admiration perhaps your Indignation Some piddling Criticks who forsooth would have a Comparison hit in every Particular and look in the wrong Place for the Simile have found Fault with the last I mentioned " What" say they  does a snowy Mountain move  as if the Essence of the Simile consisted in the Motion No surely the Beauty is only in the awful  Appearance  of a Mountain covered with Snow  which  Hector  resembled when he moved along towering in his Stature and shining in his Arms  As Comparisons need not be exact in every Particular so sometimes a Poet of a sublime Genius will run his Description beyond the Comparison when any singular Quality or Circumstance strikes upon his Fancy though it has nothing to do with the Comparison itself or the Matter that introduced it Whether this is strictly allowable by the nice Rules of Criticism I shall not determine but surely it is very natural and in my Opinion highly beautiful The French call these Comparisons  √† longue Queue  Many of them are to be found in  Homer  and  Milton  They are not so frequent in  Virgil  though I shall instance you one from him because it is but short and has been the Subject of much Altercation among the learned It is in the first Book of the Aeneid and thus translated by  Dryden  So on Eurota's  Line Quails ab Eurotae Ripis c  Banks or Cynthus' Height  Diana seems and so she charms the Sight  When in the Dance the graceful Goddess leads  The Choir of Nymphs and overtops their Heads  Known by her Quiver and her lofty Mien  She walks majestic and she looks their Queen  Latona sees her shine above the rest  And feeds with secret Joy her silent Breast  Rowe  in his Tragedy of  Ulysses  describing  Penelope  has imitated this Passage very closely  Diana thus on Cynthus' shady Top  Or by Eurota's Stream leads to the Chace  Her VirginTrain a thousand lovely Nymphs  Of Form celestial all troop by her Side  Amidst a thousand Nymphs the Goddess stands confess'd  In Beauty Majesty and Port divine  Supreme and eminent  Act I    Trapp  's Translation is more literal and nearer to the Words of  Virgil  than  Dryden's  well it might you will say inasmuch as he was not fettered to Rhyme  As on Eurota's Banks or Cynthus' Top  Diana leads her Train a thousand Nymphs  Enclose her round herself her Quiver bears  High on her Shoulder and with stately Walk  O'ertops them all A secret Pleasure slides  Along Latona's BreastSuch Dido was  The Passage about  Latona  is in the Original literally thus  Joys beat quite thro' Latona's silent Breast  Line Latonae tacitum pertentant Gaudia Pectus    but there is no coming up to  Virgil  himself  Now what I mean particularly to observe is the Circumstance of  Latona  's Joy This has nothing to do with the Comparison itself and therefore some Critics wish it had been omitted I am not one of their Number I think it adds great Beauty to the Passage Is any thing more lovely than such a Reflection as this Would it not immediately and almost irresistibly strike a Poet of a noble Fancy And is it not highly natural that a Parent should be in Transport at the Sight of a Child in such an  Attitude  if I may so express myself "The chief among ten thousand" as the Scripture  terms it and according to  Otway  if I do not err  Among ten thousand eminently known  Does not the Poet give us also a lovely Instance of Decorum in describing the Parent modestly attempting to conceal her Transports of Joy too delicate in her Feelings to exult openly How judicious a Writer was  Virgil  The Fancy and Judgment of a Poet is not more conspicuous in any Particular than in a noble and apt Simile elegantly expressed for which Reason I could wish you my dear to remark such carefully in all your reading but more especially in these three great Poets  Homer Virgil  and  Milton  I may possibly some Time or other shew you the vast Excellency of this Comparison just quoted in the Original and how far it exceeds the Translation I have little more to add at present than to observe Comparisons may be varied heightened or moderated and tempered by way of adapting them better to your Purpose nor need a Poet be confined to  as so  or  like  for you perceive  Virgil  sometimes says  have you  or  have you not seen  c  You would think  c When he wishes to soften a strong Comparison his Phrase is  you would be tempted to believe  when to strengthen one  you would have sworn  and so on I only give you Hints you can enlarge on them in your own Mind not that I mean to induce you to turn Poet but to understand the  preliminary Rules by which Things ought to be done is the Method of tasting them when done and the most certain Means of distinguishing the Beauties and Merits of one Author from another  I fear I have sufficiently tired you but it is worth your while to understand this Topic well I shall be concise in my Definition of Allegory Fable and Catachresis and then I have done with Tropes  I am  my dear  ever yours J P  LETTER CXXII  Oxon  Dec    Dear Nancy  I Shall now explain Allegory and Fable and then give you Time to breathe awhile for I fear I grow tiresome to you but it is your Good which I intend by my long Letters and Precepts delivered in this Mode of Discourse between Friends often make a deeper Impression than what are to be found in Books although they may be better explained there Besides there are several Things only cursorily explained by  Longinus  and even by  Cicero  and  Quintilian  who have enlarged much more on these Heads There are moreover in the Course of what I write several little Observations of my own which if they do you but little Service will do you as little Harm  Allegory is said to be a String of Metaphors but I think this Description defective for unless that Series of Metaphors depends on some one particular Point it is either a faulty Allegory or rather no Allegory at all To explain what I mean I will quote a Passage from  Shakespeare's Hamlet  Whether 'tis nobler in the Mind to suffer  The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune  Or to take Arms against a Sea of Troubles  And by opposing end them  This has been much censured as a faulty Allegory because the Writer flies from one Allusion to another from  Slings  to  taking up of Arms  against what  a Sea  and then  opposing a Sea  c Now if  Shakespeare  meant this for an Allegory it is doubtless very faulty but I verily believe that was not his Meaning I am of Opinion that he only took the first strong Metaphor which came into his Head to express himself forcibly and pathetically and then another and another as the Subject rose upon them but had no idea of making them connected with or dependent on each other I will not venture to affirm I am right but I am certain that one of the most judicious and correct Authors that ever wrote Comedy does the selfsame Thing  I mean  Terence  He makes one of his Characters say  I am  walled  about with so many and so great Difficulties that I cannot  swim  out  This you see is liable to the very same Exception with the former the Metaphor not being continued in the same Kind but I believe neither Author had even the most distant Notion of an Allegory  In the Passion of  Biblis  in  Ovid  's  Metamorphorsis  you have a perfect Allegory drawn from  Seafaring  I should have watch'd d whence the black Storm might rise  Ere I had trusted the unfaithful Skies  Now on the rolling Billows I am tost  And with extended Sails on the blind Shelves am lost  Here you see the Images are perfect and uniform I will quote another from  Prior's Henry  and  Emma  which is very beautiful  Did I but purpose to embark with thee  On the smooth Surface of a Summer's Sea  While gentle Zephyrs play with prosp'rous Gales  And Fortune's Favour fills the swelling Sails  But would forsake the Ship and make for Shore  When the Winds whistle and the Tempests roar  Here also you find the Allegory finely pursued throughout yet not so scrupulously as not to depart a little from it in the fourth Line  And Fortune's  Favour  fills c  May I here be permitted to say that one of  Gay  's Songs in his  Beggar's Opera  contains as perfect an Allegory as can any where be found The most minute Scrutiny can scarce mark a Deficiency  I'm like a  Skiff  on the  Ocean tost  Now  high  now  low  with each  Billow  borne  With her  Rudder  broke and her  Anchor  lost  Deserted and all forlorn  But the poetical Beauties of the  Beggar's Opera  are too generally overlooked either through an Attention to the Musical Part or that the Piece itself is considered as merely ludicrous rather than a Composition of exquisite Satire Poetry Wit and Humour  From Allegory there is an easy Transition to little proverbial Sayings and to Fables which are but Allegories worked up into a Story Our  Saviour  's Parables are of this Kind exactly in Character and obvious to every Understanding  Aesop  it is true takes the Liberty to make Birds and Beasts speak but barring that he always adheres to Character There ought to be a Moral couched in all Fables or to no Purpose are they spoke or written  Comparisons proverbial Speeches Parables and Fables may be easily converted the one into the other  Sometimes the Moral is expressed sometimes understood By some Writers it is set in Front as by  Fontaine  by some at the End as by  Aesop  and occasionally it is placed in the Middle of the Work  Those moral Sentences which we find so frequently interspersed in  Homer Virgil  Milton  c before in the Middle or at the Close of some interesting Narration are entirely in the Nature of Morals to a Fable  I shall throw a little Illustration on these Points particularly relative to proverbial Sentences and Phrases and then release my dear Scholar  We have a Proverb in  Scotland  Cocks are free of HorseCorn  meaning to imply that People are liberal or profuse of what belongs to another  Again we have  Use a Cat to the Churn and she will call i  Custom  signifying if you accustom your Servants or other Folks to make frequent Use of what is yours they will think at last that they have acquired a Right to it  How easily now may these be changed into a Comparison for Instance  As a Cat that has been allowed  c  As a Cock that sits in a Manger  c or into a Fable as  A Widow had a favourite Cat whom she indulged  and so on These simple Examples clearly shew how closely the Figures are allied  A Fable or Story may be either true or false it matters not which so that a Moral accompanies it and flows naturally from it  Here follows a Quotation from Spenser where a Fable Comparison and Moral are finely wrought up together  As when a weary Traveller that strays  By muddy Shore of broad sev'nmouthed Nile  Unweeting of the per'lous wand'ring Ways  Doth meet a cruel crafty Crocodile  Which in false Grief hiding his harmful Guile  Doth weep full sore and sheddeth tender Tears  The foolish Man that pities all this while  His mournful Plight is swallow'd anawares  Forgetful of his own who minds another's Cares  In the foregoing Part of this Letter I observed that  Aesop  though he makes his feigned Persons that is his Birds and Beasts converse and reason yet he always preserves Character One Minute's Patience more while I illustrate this His first Fable affords me the Means  A Dog with a Piece of Meat in his Mouth looking into a Pool of Water imagines he there sees another Dog with a Piece of Meat in his Mouth he snatches at that and thereby loses his own  This is all very natural to a Dog and a plain Moral is to be deduced namely that we give up Certainty for Hope when we greedily grasp at having too much  The Reverse of this Rule of preserving Character is  Dryden  's Fable of the  Hind  and  Panther  He has wholly departed from it His Hind and Panther set forth at first in Kind I allow but in the Sequel he makes them reason and  dispute about Fathers and Councils the Church and the  Pope  SchoolDivinity Infallibility and the Lord knows what He then introduces a whole Flock of Birds and characterizes them all as Men The  Buzzard  was the famous Dr  Burnet  who was Bishop of  Salisbury  Dryden  has been justly censured for this Inconsistency for say the Critics in Support of their Accusation  Suppose a Colonel of Horse had thrown up his Regiment in foolish Hope of getting a higher Command and was disappointed  Aesop's Fable might aptly be applied to him but it would be absurd to say  The Dog seeing another Dog in the Water with a Piece of Meat in his Mouth dropped  the Piece in his own Mouth and snatched at the other and so lost his  Regiment of Horse  This were to confound the Allusion with the Story alluded to the Moral with the Fable  I question whether I need trouble you with the Catachresis or no however I will be brief  Catachresis is the Abuse or overstraining a Figure One Species of it is when through the Want of proper we use improper Terms for Example a  GlassInkhorn  or a  Silver SmoothingIron  Parricide is properly the Murderer of one's Father but in Default of better Powers of Expression we apply the Name to one who has murdered either his Mother  Brother or Sister  Longinus  censures some Writer for calling a Hillock a  Wart Quintilian  has given many Instances of this and even from  Virgil  some of them very beautiful but when the Image is beautiful I think it can not with Propriety be called a Catachresis  Blackwell  pronounces the following Passage from  Milton  to be such  Down thither prone in Flight  He speeds and thro' the vast aetherial Sky  Sails between Worlds and Worlds  This is when he describes the Descent from Heaven of the ArchAngel  Raphael  I am not of his Opinion the Idea is supremely sublime but not overstrained  Statius  describing a general Silence and Quiet says  The weary Mountains nodded their Heads  And the Seas rested or slept leaning against the Shore  I forgot to mention the th Ode of  Horace  in his d Book it is finely imitated by  Dryden  there he begins with Fortune as a Goddess then allegorizes her into a Bird and lastly runs into another long Allegory of sailing in a Storm  The next Time I write I shall shew the Difference between Tropes and Figures and then in Compassion to your wondrous Patience quit the Subject  Bless you my dear Nancy  I am ever yours J P  LETTER CXXIII  Oxon  Dec    Dear Nancy  ONE Thing I advanced was that in  Homer Virgil Ovid Milton  c the Moral is often placed in the Middle of the Story Such Insertions are called Sentences or short moral Reflections  When  Turnus  kills  Pallas  in the tenth Book of the  Aeneid  and is exulting in the Victory he has obtained the Poet in the very Heart of his Story breaks forth into this Reflection  Dark to Futurity and blind to Fate  Are mortal Minds indocile to observe  Due Measure when elated with Success"  Dr Trapp  In the Beginning of the twelfth Book of the  Iliad Homer  tells us in one Line "The Grecian Wall was built without Sacrifices to the Gods" in the next Line he says "Without the good Will of the Gods" and immediately thereon adds  Without the Gods how short a Period stands  The proudest Monument of mortal Hands  The Meaning here is exactly the same with that In Psalm cxxvii I  Except the Lord build the House they but labour in vain who build it  Where by the Way you may remark the strong and figurative Turn of the Eastern Language we should probably phrase it "Without  God's Assistance"  but they more emphatically call it  "God's own Doing"  There  is a short but noble Reflection in the Story of  Calisto  in  Ovid  's Metamorphoses  Calisto  before she was dishonoured by  Jupiter  was always at the Side of  Diana  but after that disgraceful Event she declined the Freedom and lagged behind her whereon the Poet exclaims  How in the Look does conscious Guilt appear  Slowly she mov'd and loiter'd in the Rear  Nor lightly tripp'd nor by the Goddess ran  As once she us'd the Foremost of the Train  Her Looks were flush'd c  Addison  Having illustrated this Point as far I think necessary I am tempted from the foregoing Quotation to make a short Digression A most excellent Lesson my dear Nanoy may fairly be deduced from the Story of  Calisto  no doubt the Author meant it  Thus then it stands An artful practiced general Lover such was  Jove  's Character can assume any and every Appearance to effect his Purpose the more contradictory to what he really is the better his Fraud is concealed  Jove  assumes the Appearance even of  Diana  by which the Poet means that the Lover may wear the Mask of the most delicate Chastity till he finds an Opportunity to throw it off and resume the  Jove  How this is to be guarded against is also nicely insinuated by  Ovid  He seems to say  Never suffer yourself to listen to the specious Discourses of that Lover who wishes to separate you from the Virgin Throng in whose Company you are safe or from your Protectress the real  Diana  and lead you to private  Walks and secret Groves  as the Author phrases it The poor  Calisto  you see meant no Ill but she had thrown herself  out of Protection  The more plausible and specious a Lover appears the more dangerous he really is Every virtuous Woman shudders at a professed Libertine but you remember the Moral to the  Chaperon rouge  my dear Nancy which you translated at seven Years old  Helas qui ne s√ßait que ces Loups doucere  x  De tous les Loups sont les plus dangereux  and there is really but one Test to be made of this  human Wolf  namely will he suffer his Address to be made known to your tried and natural Friends your Parents or Guardians If he declines this and wishes it to be kept secret  then take Heed  The Wolf the Wolf's at Hand  I now proceed to give you as far as I am able the Difference between Tropes and Figures  In the first Place you are to know that both are occasionally called Figures and  Quintilian  himself confesses that the Distinction is very often hard to be ascertained for some figurative Expressions may belong either to Synecdoche which is a Trope or Polyptote Which is a Figure The best Distinction then that I can draw is this Trope is a Turning of the proper Sense of the Word into a borrowed or improper Sense For Example  I swell with Rage or Pride  A  Figure  is an extraordinary Expression it consists in the Point Arrangement Repetition or Disposition of Words in a Manner not common  Trope  comes from a Greek Word which signifies a Turning or Changing and is only applied where the  Sense  is turned When the Turn is in the  Words  we call it  Figure  though the Word  Trope  would be as proper to imply  Figure  but Custom has made it thus and that is sufficient for our Purpose  The Tropes are principally what we have been discoursing about and are chiefly Metaphor Metonymy Synecdoche Irony Hyperbole Allegory Comparison Sentences or short Morals  Fable or Parable and Catachresis These are most necessary to be studied  Adieu  Yours very truly J P  LETTER CXXIV  My dear Nancy  I Arrived here yesterday was a Week the Day I proposed in tolerable Health and Spirits  I commend you prodigiously my dear Nancy for your Anxiety to serve your young Friend I will assist you to the best of my Ability I enclose two Letters  which I hope will be of Use one to Mr F the other to Mrs Kth I would have your Friend convey the first but would request you to deliver the latter yourself Your speaking to the Point will I think support my Recommendation much beside that I wish you to be better acquainted with Mrs Kth She is a kindhearted Woman but very resentful if she conceives herself to be slighted Such Extremes are quite in Nature Our Anger or Indignation at the cooling Friendship of another rises in Proportion to the Warmth of our own  I am not very sorry for the Brevity of your Letter of the st but for the Cause of it and readily acquit you from  fuller Writing till your Mama is better I will in the mean Time write often not only with a Purpose to amuse but to improve and serve you the best I can with a sincere View to your Happiness both here and hereafter Those who have an Eye only to the first without considering and regarding the latter will as  Tillotson  says find themselves miserably mistaken and be as he well terms them but  witty Fools  at best  I wish your Mama better  Adieu  ma tr√®s chere Nannette  J P  Oxon  April    St George is for England St Dennis for France  Sing Honi soit qui Mal y pense  LETTER CXXV  Oxford  April    My dear Nancy  I Have the Pleasure of yours of the th and heartily congratulate you on your Mama being somewhat better Do not remit your Attention to her to oblige me Till she is further advanced in her Recovery I desire only a Line to tell me how you both go on and whether your young Friend has been successful in her Application The Want of a Situation and Protection at such an early Time of Life naturally claims our Compassion and Assistance but I am still  further concerned and anxious for a happy Result in this Business because I am so entirely pleased to see your Readiness to interest yourself in another's Welfare and it would grieve me were this first Effort of a kind Disposition damped or disappointed  I have not had Time since my Arrival to apply to Authors but if I had I believe I should forbear to enter upon them minutely till you are at Liberty to take Part in them  I hope the young Lady you mention will not suffer that Inattention to her Mother to grow upon her She should recall herself betimes or Inattention will too soon become total Negligence and  Disobedience succeed to both Let her then beware I never through Life saw any Failure in Duty more certainly and constantly meet with a Punishment than Undutifulness to Parents  J P  LETTER CXXVI  Oxon  May    My Dear  I Received yours and thank you for it I do not expect or desire more than such a short Intelligence while your Mama continues so ill You are right not to neglect her in any Point you owe her more than ever you can repay  I have been reviewing some of your Letters today and am thence induced to advance a Trifle on this Kind of Correspondence and the Style necessary for it Persevere my dear in that simple Manner of writing which you seem to inherit from Nature Epistolary Correspondence should be as easy as Conversation Do not suffer an Intimacy with sublime Authors to tempt you out of this plain humble Manner of expressing yourself You are an Exception to a very general Rule It is too much the Custom of young Folks when once they have dipped into Books to endeavour at highflown Language in their Writing Nothing is so absurd allowing they express themselves ever so properly the Expressions are misplaced They have  no Business in a Letter where every thing should be plain easy and concise  Figure above all Things should be avoided in these familiar Discourses I have known a Novice in Reading and Writing missed by a Simile so as not to know the Point he first advanced and another so envelope himself in a Metaphor as not to be able to find the Way out  All Errors of this Kind you will be sure to avoid if you persevere in your own Way The more you adhere to Simplicity the nearer you approach to Elegance  I am  my dear  ever yours J P  PS  I am going from this Place on Business which I believe will detain me a Fortnight so do not wonder if you do not hear from me in that Time but what you write will be punctually conveyed to me  Encore adieu  LETTER CXXVII  Oxon  May    My Dear  I Returned last Night I had yours of the th th and th very safe and am heartily glad your Mother is  better I make no Doubt but you discharged your Duty to her  I here enclose a Letter for Mr  Millan  whose Shop is near  Old Man's CoffeeHouse  between  CharingCross  and  WhiteHall  It is an Order to deliver you  Spenser  and any Author beside that you may fancy when you are there  I expect to hear from you more frequently now as you will have more Time There are several Portions both of the Holy Scriptures and the Apocrypha that I recommended long ago to your Perusal and which you promised to read attentively Have you done so You do not mention them They are of more intrinsic Value towards your  present Welfare and future Happiness than all the other Books I know put together and will be ever deemed so by Persons of solid Sense I will mention one or two Passages which I have reflected on a thousand Times and it will be well for you to carry them much in your Mind for they will never fail  God  says  Him that honoureth me will I honour and whoever despiseth me shall be lightly esteemed  The next Passage is in the first Book of  Samuel  Chap xvi Verse  For the Lord seeth not as Man seeth for Man looketh on the outward  Appearance but the Lord looketh on the Heart  I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  LETTER CXXVIII  Oxon  June    My dear Nancy  Since my last I have read the chief of  Moliere  's Plays some of them are indeed but  petites Pieces  This Week I design to examine  Le Medecin malgr√© lui Amphitryon Le Misantrope  and  L'Avare  I propose to  read the two last with great Care as they are reputed two of his finest Plays  L'Ecole des Femmes  is my great Favourite and for a petite Piece  Les precieuse Ridicules  I like the  Femmes S√ßavantes  mightily  Le Malade Imaginaire  was  Moliere  's last Play and thought by some Critics to be the best he ever wrote I think at least there is more Instruction and Diversion mingled together in this than in many of his Pieces The  Misantrope  perhaps is the most masterly but it does not create so much Mirth as some others and the Characters and Sentiments require great Attention  I will now set down the Plays which I have read and which you are not acquainted with  George Dandin Tartuffe Monsieur Pourceaugnac Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme Les Fourberies de Scapin Les Femmes S√ßavanies Le Malade Imaginaire  You will find the first third fourth and fifth very entertaining  fort enjou√©es  as the French say The second sixth and seventh are very instructing and will likewise give you great Pleasure especially the two last  Moliere  's four great Plays in my Opinion are  Le Misantrope L'Avare Le Malade Imaginaire  and  L'Ecole des Femmes  I think the Character of  Agnes  in  L'Ecole des Femmes  and that of  Alceste  in the  Misantrope  the two finest he ever drew  The next in Degree is  Arnolphe  in  L'Ecole des Femmes  The two Brothers  Ariste  and  Sganarelle  in  L'Ecole des Maris Madame Pernelle  in  Tartuffe  the two  precieuses Ridicules Sosie  in  Amphitryon Harpagon  and the  Commissaire  in  L'Avare  are all finely drawn not but there are many others well executed but these strike me most and must have cost him great Pains to paint as their Excellence consists not only in their being truly just and natural but they are withal nicely and highly finished  Some of his Pieces are of the OperaKind especially  L'Isle D'Amour  and  Princesse d'Elide Psyche  and  Melicerte  which last is a pastoral heroic Comedy  These which you have read are the best excepting only  Le Malade Imaginaire  The  Bourgeois Gentilhomme  and  Monsieur de Pourceaugnac  will divert you much  George Dandin Les Fourberies de Scapin  and  La Contesse D'Escarbagnas  will likewise give you some Pleasure All which I have now gone through I did read formerly except the  Contesse D'Escarbagnas  She is a silly vain affected Woman of Quality who had been once in her Life at  Paris  for about two Months which runs mightily in her Head She has some Resemblance of Lady  Plyant  but in my Opinion is not so well drawn  I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  P S  I write down such particular Phrases as I think worth remarking I hope you do the same it will much increase your Knowledge of the Language  LETTER CXXIX  Oxon  June    My dear Nancy  I Have the Pleasure of yours of the th of this Month Our Opinions of  Moliere  I see are pretty nearly alike and I am not displeased to see it  There is a Poem of  Moliere  in Commendation of  Mignard  's Painting in a  Church at  Paris  It is called  La Gloire du Dome du Val de Grace  but this I have not yet read  This Week I have gone through  L'Etourdi Don Juan Le Depit amoureux Les Amans Magnifiques  and  L'Ombre de Moliere L'Etourdi  is the first Play he wrote The chief Entertainment of this Piece consists in the Address and Contrivance of the Servant being perpetually overturned by the Blunders of his Master Though the latter promises again and again not to meddle in the Schemes of the former yet his Vanity and SelfSufficiency still prompt him to interfere anew and ruin the whole We see in the Servant that a Pride to have his Plots succeed induces him to be constant to his  Master rather than his Love and Fidelity and at the last the Scheme succeeds more by good Luck than any other Circumstance All this is very judiciously hit off by the Author but to make the Servant talk to his Master in the most sarcastical Strain and ever and anon call him Beast and Fool is beyond all Bounds of Propriety and Decorum  Don Juan  is dreadfully destroyed by Thunder and Lightning and the Earth swallows him which Fate is in a Manner foretold to him by an Apparition Nothing can end more tragically yet  Moliere  calls it a Comedy  Juan  's Character is horridly fine and consistent throughout  bien souten√ª  as the French express it He is brave fierce excessively  passionate not devoid of Sense or Wit but a most abandoned Wretch The Moral of the Play is good and there are some very diverting Scenes particularly one with a Merchant who comes to dun  Juan  for Money whence Mr  Congreve  I surmise took the Hint of the Scene to the same Effect between  Valentine  and  Trapland  The Sentiments and Dialogue of the  Depit amoureux  are good the Character of Women given by  Grosren√®  to his Master is very entertaining and though there is no Excess of Wit or Humour in the Piece yet it is the bestconducted Plot in all  Moliere  The Manner whereby he winds all his Personages out of their Difficulties engages the Attention wonderfully  and conveys a Pleasure rather from the Result of the whole than from Particulars I would therefore my Dear have you read it with great Attention  There is no great Matter in the  Amans Magnifiques  yet it is entertaining but the Interlude after the second Act a sort of little pastoral Drama is I think one of the finest Things I ever saw in that Way It is simple natural and perfectly suited to the pastoral Character The Song of  Tircis  which is called the first Scene and that of  Caliste  which is the third are tender and natural beyond Expression and the rest entirely accord with them  Le Malade Imaginaire  is admirably fine but herein  Moliere  has been much blamed for attacking Physic as an Art In his other Plays say they he attacks Quackery and the Abuse of that Art but here he attacks Physic itself and represents the very Science as an Imposition on Mankind I am afraid there is something of this too true in the Conversation between the Miser and his Brother  L'Ombre du Moliere  is a  petite Piece  It was written by one  Brecourt  who was an Actor under  Moliere  The Plan is thisThe Ghosts of many of those Personages whom  Moliere  had turned into Ridicule come to  Pluto  in the other World to complain of him The whole  is pretty well executed in particular the Character of the  Doctor  but I cannot by any Means perceive a Reason for introducing the Ghost of  Nicolle  in the  Bourgeois Gentilhomme  Adios  ma chere Nannette  J P  LETTER CXXX  Oxon  June    I Have now read  Moliere's Plaisirs de L'Isle Enchant√©e  with the  Princesse d'Elide  which is a Part of it It costs a World of Pains to read it through and it is of that Species which gives more  Pleasure by being considered all together than in its particular Parts There is something remarkably fine and natural in the Character and Behaviour of the  Prince d'Hague  and the  Princesse d'Elide  and proves the Author well understood Humankind But I shall not enter into it minutely that I may not forestall your Pleasure It will cost you some Pains in reading but is worth them all only to consider those two Characters thoroughly They are not only perfectly well drawn but withal very instructive I think the Character of  Moron  rather unnatural It is both in Verse and Prose and there is something in each not to be found in the other which deserves well to be read it will therefore cost you a double Application If you  will mark down Phrases and Words which are new to you you will find the Advantage of it When you have examined these very carefully we will discourse on the particular Beauties  Since I left  Moliere  I have applied myself again to  Horace  I have gone through all his Satires Epistles Art of Poetry the two first Books of his Odes and half of the third It is much to be lamented that this inimitable Author is not well translated I do not know where there are more excellent Instructions for the Conduct of human Life At present I shall only recommend to your Perusal the second and eighteenth Epistles in the first Book and the tenth Satire in the second Book Howbeit in any Translation  they must fall infinitely short of the poetical Beauty of the Original yet the good Sense contained in them will shine through any Disguise  J P  LETTER CXXXI  Oxon  July    YOU desire my Opinion of  Moliere  One general Complaint is that he mixes too much Farce with his Plays I own I think so too  Boileau  has noticed  Geronte  in the Sack in the  Fourberies of Scapin  The  Bourgeois Gentilhomme  ends in a mere Farce and a most extravagant one too The Dispute between  the two Servants about letting in their Master is quite a Farce so is  Toinette  's acting the Part of the  Doctor  in the  Malade Imaginaire  nor can I perceive why it is introduced There are many more Instances of this Kind in his Plays Those who defend him say he was compelled to this by the Humour of the Time that he had to please the Town as well as the  S√ßavants  the People of Taste and the Court and that the Success of his Pieces depended on the first Set of Hearers as well as the others In Truth I think this no bad Defence and it must be allowed that these Scenes would in a Farce be very entertaining  Some say his Language is not perfectly pure I will not pretend to decide in that but the different Characters he brings in ought to be considered for Example in the  Bourgeois Gentilhomme  when he introduces a  Gasconne  and a  Picarde  should he not make them speak the  Patois  of their respective Countries Moreover as many of his Plays are not only in Verse but in Rhyme this might be a Constraint and oblige him often to use uncouth and obsolete Words  The greatest Objection to  Moliere  is still behind and that is that there is sometimes a sort of Deficiency in the  Denouement  of his Plot This Objection was made by the great  Monsieur Le Clerc  and I think this is not only true respecting the unravelling of the Story but in several of his Plays I think his Plot is not conducted with all the Address in the World and that it is even too loosely put together  Congreve  's Plots are admirably conducted and if they have any Fault it is that they are so closely woven that unless we consider them very narrowly the Contexture will escape us but then they add great Beauty and Grace to the Piece when unfolded and brought in View This is particularly evinced in his  Way of the World  where every thing is judiciously linked together and each Incident arises naturally out of the other In my next I shall send my Thoughts on  Moliere  's Beauties which greatly exceed his Faults  My humble Service to your Mama and Aunt et restez bien assur√©e que je suis fort de vos Amis  J P  LETTER CXXXII  Oxon  July    My dear Nancy  I AM favoured with yours of the th instant and shall answer the latter Part of it first  Those People whose Description you have noted are the antient  Belgians  and their Neighbourhood which contains  Holland Flanders  and the rest of the  Low Countries  the Archbishoprick of  Triers Liege Juliers Cleve  and  Berg  You will understand such Descriptions better if you will apply to a Map of  Europe  Beside that it is useful to point out the Situation of Places it will make your reading more pleasant By these Means you will see how our Armies abroad lie what Way they march what Towns are besieged and taken When we hear News or read History and have no Knowledge of the Situation of Towns Countries Rivers Seas  c  we receive little Pleasure and less Instruction from what we hear and read  It is reported that Elephants never lie down to sleep on Account of the Stiffness  of their Joints which makes them unable to rise therefore when they are inclined to sleep they lean against a Tree The Indians in order to catch them saw the Tree half asunder or more which giving Way the Beast falls This perhaps is fabulous for they have much better Methods to catch them but the Story may serve well enough to build a Simile upon  I think the Simile of Night exceeding fine but defective you should consider it is not Night only but Silence also that he is describing  Virgil  takes in the Winds and Waves the silent March of the Stars  The Winds no longer whisper thro' the Woods  Nor murm'ring Tides disturb the gentle Floods  The Stars in silent Order march'd around  And Peace with downy Wings was brooding on the Ground  This is Part of the Description only and infinitely short of the Original it is in the fourth Book of the  Aeneid  The last of these Lines contains in the Original but four Words and literally translated signifies "When every Field held its Tongue" What  Dryden  calls  To haunt the Woods or swim the weedy Pool  is in  Virgil  which inhabit the Country that is rough with Shrubs and Bushes and the wideextended liquid Lakes  Virgil  gives us none but beautiful Ideas Why does  Tasso  present us with  the Serpent's Hiss and Dragon's Cry  I own they are natural but they are also frightful and as  Shakespeare  says they  make Night hideous  Virgil  makes every thing to be at Rest but  Dido  It was for her Sake the Description was brought in and the Excess of her Passion and Distress is vastly heightened by the beautiful Picture of every thing being at Rest except herself  Tasso  makes all at Rest but the Music of the Spheres This is injudicious What has the Music of the Spheres to do here It is an old idle Fancy besides  as  Hudibras  says We hear it not why then was it excepted or how can a Noise which is not heard lull the World to Rest I give you this as a Specimen of the superior Judgment of  Virgil  and the Beauty that arises therefrom notwithstanding I allow that  Tasso  's Description with these Abatements has its Merit If you would read  Bossu  carefully especially his Contrast of  Virgil  and  Statius  you would see how natural and judicious the former is and how much the latter falls short of him  J P  LETTER CXXXIII  Oxon  July    Dear Nancy  YOU ask my Advice in many Points wherein I think you are able perfectly to direct yourself Your Conduct in general is very satisfactory to me and I believe to your Mama however to the best of my Ability I will comply with your Request and it will be no Burthen to have two or three spare Rules by you  In one Part of your Letter you desire a Plan to live by I never could live  by a Plan myself consequently am unfit to lay down one to you and I love my own Liberty too well to abridge that of other People  I believe one very general Error in young Folks is a too great Readiness to make Acquaintance This ought to be most warily guarded against Much of our Happiness Reputation end Welfare depends upon the Choice of Intimates  A proper Division of Time is another very material Point I am as much a Friend to innocent Recreations as to Business The only Nicety is to steer between too close an Application to the latter and an Excess in the former Your little Neighbour Miss D will  live to repent her ill Custom of sitting up late at Night and loitering abed in the Morning Few Things are more prejudicial to Business Reputation and Health A thousand Inconveniencies are entailed which are not dreamed of at first She might break herself of it easily now and may find it very hard some Years hence I once loved it as well as she does yet I got over it and now rise every Day between six and seven  A proper Division of Time preserves us from being hurried at one Time and made languid and weary at another it gives a  Gout  to Diversion and makes Business sit light and easy  A proper Choice of Companions at your early Time of Life chiefly is of the utmost Consequence There is great Truth in the old Proverb  A Man is esteemed according to the Company he keeps  for such as our Company is such in great Measure shall we ourselves be We fall insensibly and almost unavoidably into the Manners Air Sentiments and Turn of those Persons with whom we converse much especially in our early Years so that young People cannot be too much on their Guard in this Particular Our Reputation is also affected by the Company we keep Is there any thing oftner heard than this and when nothing else perhaps can be alledged  Ay such a young Man or such a Girl is very good but too  much in such or suchaone's Company  Our Associates therefore should be as good and as wise as may be found at least in our own Opinion and the higher Credit and Reputation they are in the better still for us  I am far from dictating or prescribing rigidly I would not have a Person tied down to a formal Method to move like a Puppet upon Wires I am very sensible that Diversion and Company are almost as necessary as Meat Drink or Sleep but I dare say you will agree with me that there are certain Measures Proportions and Distributions in all Sorts of Recreation as  well as Business which we ought seldom to exceed  I am  my dear Nancy  your most affectionate Friend and Servant J P  LETTER CXXXIV  Oxon  July    My Dear  AS I begin to have but few Franks I must put two or three Letters into one  I am ready to answer your Questions about dividing your Time aright and  to give you the best Directions I can on that Point It is of the greatest Moment to Happiness Your desiring Information on this Head pleases me much though as I said before I think you do not stand in need of it however I will express myself as if you did that I may give my Meaning more clear and to the Purpose  I cannot enter minutely into Particulars those must occur to yourself as Circumstances Times and Occasions fall out I shall only observe some general Things and explain and illustrate them to you in the best Manner I can  First then in order to employ Time well to lay it out to Purpose and in  due Proportions it must be supposed that you have Time in your Possession The Question then is how to purchase a sufficient Quantum or Measure of Time This is not so hard for you now at least as for many People whose Time belongs to others not to themselves who perhaps are Masters or Mistresses of Families who have WareHouses or Shops to look after or some other Charge that requires great Portions of their Time Be that as it may a certain Stock of Time is necessary for Business for Improvement and for all the necessary Functions of Life Eating Drinking Sleeping and even Recreation and Diversion for these are necessary too but always in Order to qualify us  for some better and more important Purposes and are to be used as Means to attain some End we aim at and not as the Things themselves  How then are we to purchase this  Stock of Time  Without this by us our Time however judiciously distributed will not answer For Example if I have but a Crown to go to Market with and must necessarily have Things to the Value of a Guinea let me lay out my Money ever so prudently it will not serve my Purpose Herein is evinced the vast Necessity of purchasing as great a Fund of Time as we can  To this Purpose I know no one particular Thing so conducive as rising early  We then have the whole Day before us can dress in Time breakfast in Time go abroad or stay at Home as Affairs demand if the former we are sure of meeting People at the ordinary Hours of Meals Business or Diversion beside the Mind is more fresh active and strong to apply to Study or any other Employment that requires us  An Hour in the Morning is worth three in the Afternoon  is a common Proverb and I never knew a truer The Light Heat and Air of the Day is much more healthy and chearful than the cold dark Damps and Inconveniency of the Night The brute Creation teaches us this The dumb Creatures retire early to Rest and get up betimes to busy  themselves in Quest of Food or in bringing forth or bringing up their Young or in providing for the Winter Nature instructs them that the Light and Warmth of the Sun makes that the Time of Business but if we will sit up in the Dead and Damps and Darkness of the Night exposed to the Vapours of that unwholesome Season we must lie late and thereby lose a great Part of the proper Time for Business or Study we must breakfast when others dine dine when others sup and sup when they sleep so that our Time is as I may say quite disjointed and can never hit or square with the Times of Business Meals or Visits of other People By these Irregularities every Thing goes to Disorder and Confusion and beside the Loss of so much  Time and that the proper Time the Indolence and Inactivity that latesittingup and late lyingabed creates renders us quite unfit and unapt for making Use of the Residue of Time left for Action  Dr  Swift  has painted this so just and strong in one of the Poems which I copied out for you that I need not expatiate further on it  Would not a Merchant be laughed at for a Fool or Madman who should loiter away his Time till the Exchange were shut a Minister till the Time of Divine Service were past a Lawyer till the Courts were up or a Physician till the Patient were past Recovery or dead It is just as ridiculous and foolish in us to mistime  time the common Affairs and Business of Life  Solomon  I think says  The slothful Man ploweth in Harvest  meaning that he mistimes his Affairs and neglects to sow his Grain till others are going to reap theirs  Another Means of purchasing Time is when we foresee a Crowd of Things coming on us together and that we shall be hurried to steal some Time before hand if we can to do some Part of it or block it as we say and prepare it so that it may become more easy and light  I have a great Number of Affairs to do tomorrow I foresaw them yesterday I therefore chose to let Mr  L  make a Visit then I seized the Time  I had yesterday Afternoon to myself I have wrote several Letters which are not to go till tomorrow have put my Papers in Order and made a Beginning in having dispatched all preparatory Work I only mention this to illustrate to you what I mean  I shall give you the Respite of a Day or two before I pursue this Matter What I have to say further will be easily discussed  I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  LETTER CXXXV  Oxford  July    My Dear  I Am very well pleased with your judicious Remarks on  Tasso  I knew you did not prefer  Tasso  's Description of Night to that of  Virgil  though I thought proper to observe the Difference of the Choice of Circumstances therein in those two Poets  I wrote to you in my last about the Purchasing of Time and shall here add the following Observation leaving what I have to say farther on the Distribution of Time to another Occasion A particular  Piece of Business will prevent me for a While  What signifies getting Time enough without being able to use it If we are lazy indolent or indisposed it will be much the same as if we had it not It will be like earning a good Meal without a Stomach to digest it or an Appetite to eat it so that if we have ever so much Time and have not Application or if we are what the French call  dissip√©  it can be of very little Advantage to us  In order then to fit us for the right Employment of Time our Mind ought to be cool and serene our Thoughts clear our Spirits in Vigour but undisturbed and not in a Flurry The Means  to attain this Disposition is to endeavour to be in good Health of Body There is a strange Sympathy and Connection between the Body and Mind the one is seldom well when the other is out of Order I am not going to prescribe to you as a Doctor not being skilled in that Profession but certainly Regularity and Moderation in Eating Drinking Sleep Exercises Study Business and Diversions are the best Means of preserving Health and consequently of attaining an Easiness and Calm of Mind joined with Clearness and Strength of Thought  But there are some other Things that incapacitate us for Study or Business which arise from the Mind itself All  immoderate Passions such as Grief Anger too earnest Desires an inordinate Pursuit of Pleasure or Trifles and setting a too high Value on them all these dissipate our Minds unnerve and weaken them and at last sink them leaving nothing but the Dregs of Thought behind  Another Consideration should make us still more careful to avoid whatever impairs or destroys our Health of Body or the Faculties of our Mind The Body and Mind do not only act upon and affect one another mutually but they react again and again upon each other like a Ball tossed to and fro forward and backward in a TennisCourt Grief Rage Envy or any other violent Passions do not only disturb and distract  the Mind but they affect the Health when the Health is affected these Passions become more violent and less supportable these Passions when become more violent give a new Wound to the Health which adds fresh Force or at least more Malignity to the Passions and so on reciprocally and if  God  out of his infinite Goodness had not given us such Constitutions as sometimes to get the better of all this  we do not know how  this Action and Reaction would certainly destroy us indeed it very often does  I shall refer the Remainder to my next and am  dear Nancy  yours most affectionately J P  LETTER CXXXVI  Oxon  Aug    Dear Nancy  I Have written you my Thoughts in the best Manner I can about purchasing Time and how that Time may not be useless by our being in an unfit Disposition to use it The Question now is how that Time ought to be distributed laid out or bestowed  There are two or three general Rules I would have you observe  First reckon with yourself how much Time such or such a Thing may take  then how much such another Thing and so on and divide and distribute your Time accordingly  But then in the next or rather in the first Place you ought to make a sort of Calculation or Reckoning of how many Things you have to do as for Example today or tomorrow and forecast in your Mind in what Order you will do them  Then consider what Time is most proper for the one and what for the other what in the Morning what in the Afternoon  c  By all Means consider what is most necessary what is most valuable what  deserves most Time Common Sense and the universal Consent of the World allow that these are to be most minded so that if you have Time the greatest Portion of that as well as of Care Pains Application and Study are to be laid out on Things that deserve it best or that we are most interested in or what must be necessarily done and if in Spite of all our Endeavours we have not Time enough and are hurried we ought always to prefer what is most necessary and most valuable  Some People when hurried either unavoidably or through their own Fault will leave nothing undone but do a little of every thing and so slubber their Affairs that nothing is done to the Purpose  whereas it would have been much better in that Hurry to have left the less necessary Things absolutely untouched till another Occasion  The Purchase of Time will put us out of the Necessity of being hurried being in good Health and Spirits will double Time and keep us from being languid forecasting the Particulars will keep us from an Uncertainty and Irresolution of what we are to do  The due Distribution of Time and chusing the most proper Seasons is necessary to doing Things well and effectually  The Preference of Things or Studies that are most necessary valuable or profitable will always make our Business and Study most advantageous to us  To this I shall add that in Things indifferent we ought to consult our Bent and Humour if it is not inclined to what is trifling or worse to what our Genius is fittest for We shall assuredly learn much more and more to the Purpose when we apply to what we have a Turn for than to what is  against the Grain  I only hint these Points to you without expatiating on them which indeed I have not Time for at present nor do  I think it needful Your own good Sense will see into the Truth of them and reflect and enlarge upon them  I own such is human Frailty that we cannot at all Times come up to the strict Observance of them even with all our Endeavours but we should surely strive to do it in the Main and as forcibly as we are able  I own too that Sickness Indisposition unforeseen Accidents Visits Avocations and Interruptions of many Sorts and even Business itself will break in on these Rules but they ought not surely to be wholly neglected because they cannot be precisely kept  These Rules are general and will always hold true at least in my humble Opinion and if they always hold true we should always endeavour to keep to them with those Allowances above I do not think I need trouble you with any more of this Kind nor indeed do I immediately recollect any but there are some particular Things which in a long Course of Time I have observed these are a sort of  Knacks  if I may call them so of studying or doing Business in an useful Way Every Man I suppose has some of those peculiar to himself and there may be many which I never heard of but such as have been observed by me I shall make the Subject of my next Letter and I am confident from Experience  that they cannot fail of being very serviceable to any Person who pleases to practise them  I am  my dear Nancy  your affectionate Friend J P  LETTER CXXXVII  Oxon  Aug    My dear Nancy  I Received yours of the th of this Month with which I am very well pleased  I would fain give you a true Idea of the Importance of the few Rules or Directions which I offered you in my late Letters  Consider then that our Time is limited we have but a certain Portion of Time to live and even That of the longest Liver is but very short How great a Part of it is taken up in Eating Drinking Sleeping Dressing Company Avocations Interruptions and many other Functions of Life that are necessary and indispensable or at least unavoidable Add to these Indisposition Sickness the Decays of old Age and the Cares of Life which grow upon us daily  But if we were to live ever so long pray consider that our Understandings and Memories are limited and are very short and imperfect even those Persons whose Memories are strongest and most tenacious can retain but very few Things in Comparison with what they see hear read and observe Many Things slide out of our Memories some sooner others later and many make no Impression at all  In like Manner our Understandings are limited some can comprehend more others less but the highest Pitch that human Understanding can fly to is but very low There are moreover Thousands of Things that if we should rack our Understandings ever so much we  can never attain to the Knowledge and Comprehension of they lye without the Sphere and Province of our Conception or as Mr  Locke  expresses it  beyond the Length of our Tether  Philosophers say there are certain Cells in the Brain some of which are the Seats of our Reason or Understandings and others of our Memory Some are more capacious than others others not so capacious but hold what they receive better however there is but a limited Number and when full they can hold no more or at least new Ideas when they take Place justle out the old ones  If Time were to endure for ever or very long we need not be so solicitous of husbanding it well or short as it is if our Understandings and Memories were infinite or at least of a vast Compass we could do a great deal in a small Space But as the wise Author of our Being has disposed Things otherwise ought we not to obey the Limitation he has prescribed us  To divide and distribute our Time aright should we not endeavour to be in a Disposition of Mind and Body to be able to take Time when Time is and to chuse fit and proper Periods for acting and when we are disposed and capable to use Time  Ought we not to prefer what is proper useful worthy and necessary to that which is less so much more to Trifles unless for Diversion or Recreation and most of all to what is bad hurtful or vicious  If you or I or any one else waste Time in reading useless Books or in some impertinent Thing or frivolous Employ the idle Ideas we lay up justle or keep out as many good and wholesome ones if they slide away and leave Room for better which is the best that can befall us in such a Case we have at least lost so much Time but if they fix on our Memory and Understanding then indeed our State is doubly miserable I still except necessary  Recreations and the particular Trades or Business wherein we are brought up and by which we must get a Livelyhood many whereof are in themselves trifling enough but then they are necessary as being the Means of Subsistence  Now if the proper Times and particular Seasons of Application and when we are fit and capable to apply are to be watched and taken how much more is the Time of Life in general which is fittest for us and to which we are best suited to be well and diligently applied I mean the Time of our Youth when the Journey of Life is before us when we have most Leisure before we are engaged in the Cares and Concerns  of the World we are to struggle through when our Minds are most pliable and when we receive the deepest and most lasting Impressions when we have a certain Facility both of taking up Things and retaining themOn all Accounts therefore Youth is the most proper Season to lay in a Fund for carrying us through the World with Comfort and Joy and Innocence and Credit How many Wretches do we see of both Sexes who for Want of this Precaution and Provision lead miserable and disgraceful Lives and come to an untimely and shameful End  There is one Thing in regard to the Narrowness of our Understanding which give me Leave to mention to you  Some Things are hard and require much Attention to be comprehended aright If these Things are necessary or worth our While the Difficulty ought not to frighten us but if they are otherwise we should not break our Heads about them Some have a Genius for one Thing some for another and it is wonderful to observe how ready and able some People are to learn some Things and how hard it is to make them comprehend others which one would think much easier  Pope  has treated this with great Justice somewhere in his Works I think it is in the fourth Book of his  Dunciad  He laughs at the Practice of our Schools and Colleges where they set every Boy  to the making of Verses without considering whether he has Talents for it or no  I have been often told that the Jesuits abroad take a quite different Method with their Pupils They carefully study the Temper and Turn of Mind and when they have discovered that they then set them to that which their Genius is most suited to  But some Things lie quite out of the Reach of our Understanding All the natural Philosophers that have been or are now in the World have not hitherto been able to account for Thousands of Things that present themselves to us every Day why for Example the Grass  is green the Rose red the Lily white the Cowslip yellow the Violet blue the Tulip variegated or partycoloured why a certain Sort of Tree always bears an Apple another a Pear a third a Plumb and so forth with Millions of other Things We have but few Faculties and fewer Senses which are the Inlets of all Knowledge All the Descriptions and Definitions that can be made will never give a Man who was born blind the least Idea or Notion of a Colour or one born deaf any Notion of Sound Things being thus how idle is it in People to puzzle themselves with Objects that lie without the Sphere of their Knowledge or Comprehension And if it be so in these lesser Matters how rash is it with regard to the high and tremendous  Mysteries of our Religion in presuming Men to endeavour to explain them to others who cannot comprehend them themselves  Dr  Sherlock  Father to the present Bishop of  Salisbury  did more Hurt to Religion at least in my Opinion though undesignedly by endeavouring to explain the  Trinity  than if he had wrote a Treatise against it  Others presumptuously and prophanely contemn and deride desperately reject and renounce our Holy Religion and the sacred Treasures of the Scripture because forsooth they cannot comprehend every thing taught there as if  nothing could be true but what they could account for although they see ten thousand Things every Day that are obvious to their Senses and yet not one of them can be accounted for by the Wit of all Mankind put together  Such Scoffers as these would perhaps term what I am saying  Cant  they have many low Arts and Expressions to support each other in such vain Tenets as are not to be justified by Reason God forbid they should ever affect the sober and meek Better is it for us to be submissive teachable and humbleminded than to sail along with a Tide of Fools whose greatest  Comfort must be the Hope of being  Nothing  at last  I am  my dear Nancy  your sincere Friend and Wellwisher J P  LETTER CXXXVIII  Oxon  Aug    My dear Nancy  I Resume my Discourse on the Employment of Time  Besides the few general Rules which every Body should observe as much as  their Health and Disposition of Mind and Business will allow them there are some particular Things which if observed will in my Opinion tend much to our bestowing Time to Purpose  But there is one of these general Rules which I must again recommend as a certain Knack or Nostrum to make Time pass easily and profitably and that is what I called  forecasting  what we have to do or what we design to read or study for Instance in the Evening what we are to do next Day or in the Morning what we are to do all Day or for two or three Days to come  There are many excellent Effects follow on this Method  First we find hereby when we shall have a void Space of Time we can therefore fill it up with something that would oppress us afterwards or we can beforehand if we have no Business that will hurry us after contrive something to do or read or some Diversion that would encroach too much on Business at another Time or contrive our Visits so as not to encroach on Business at all  It would also give us a View of all we had to do at once so that we should not only proportion our Time aright but even chuse the fittest Time for every Branch of our Business and Diversion  We should moreover not be at a Loss or Doubt what to do first or whether to do such a Thing or not I have often felt that when I was surprised with an idle Space of Time for Want of having forcasted what I was to do I continued in Doubt and Irresolution and in a sauntering Disposition and as much to seek as when I happened to be surprised with a Hurry of Business not knowing where or how to begin This is the Reason that so many People are longer in beginning and falling to Action than others are in compleating it Many People have I seen come to a Friend's House in order to spend an Afternoon but presently perhaps they remembered they had something to do then away they would go then perhaps change  their Minds and come back again I have seen People go in and out of a CoffeeHouse three or four Times in half an Hour or go perhaps along half a Street then turn short and go another Way or turn back All this comes from not forecasting what they have to do and not having resolved to do what they have suddenly taken into their Heads  No Doubt you have seen all this as well as I and I do not say that I have not been guilty of it as well as others  I have been in Company where I have seen People that were for the Park then for VauxHall and not the Park then for neither but for the PlayHouse then  not for that but for the Tavern yet at last went to none of them My God how uneasy are these People to themselves and often to others All proceeds I say from not forecasting Things beforehand and Want of Resolution to execute what they intend In short the good Effects of Forecast are so visible and the bad Effects of the Want of it so obvious that I need not longer dwell upon it  I must refer the rest to my next  I am  dear Nancy  yours J P  LETTER CXXXIX  Oxon  Sept    Dear Nancy  SINCE I wrote you last I have been much in the Country and besides there has been such a Hurry in this Town with HorseRaces Balls Concerts and a World of Company that I had not Time to write as I designed  I have three Letters of yours unanswered all on the same Subject  Tasso's Jerusalem delivered  and am very well pleased with them  What they call the  Fortunate Islands  is certainly fabulous as the Gardens of  Alcinous  the Grotto of  Circe  and  Calypso  and the  Hesperian  Gardens Whether any of the Antients found the Way to the  Azores  Islands or our  Bermudas  Islands which it is said bid fair to answer the poetical Descriptions is more than we know or whether they took their Hints from some dark Account of Paradise  Homer  wrote his  Odyssey  near three thousand Years ago  Tasso  I believe not above three Hundred I cannot conceive why he differs from  Homer  in his Account of  Ulysses Lisbon  is reported to have been named so by  Ulysses  if he really did name it he must have failed without  Hercules  's  Pillars  which were at the Straits of  Gibraltar  as may be seen by the Map  Tomorrow or next Day I shall have more Leisure to write and then you may count to hear from me  Je suis toujours  ma chere Nannette  votre Ami tr√®s sincere J P  LETTER CXL  Oxon  Sept    My dear Nancy  TO resume my Discourse on Time The last Rule I think that I wished to be observed to stop wearisome  Gaps in Time was either to prepare something that we know is before our Hand or resume something that we had not Time to finish This is an excellent Method of keeping ourselves from Indolence and Idleness and forwarding our Business Study or Knowledge and nothing so much contributes to make this easy and practicable as forelaying every thing we have to do When we look before us we shall see what Time we are like to be disengaged and then we can provide for the right Use of that Time  Another Point I would recommend is as follows When we have not any thing to prepare beforehand nor any thing to do that was obliged to be left  undone suppose we were to think of some ByStudy or useful Matter to employ ourselves in that should touch us but on such Occasions  For Example Nancy what if you in such a Case should get the Use of some NewsPapers particularly the General or London Evening Post read them over and even the Advertisements You would there find many Things of which you have as yet perhaps no Idea As all  Europe  is now in Motion you would hereby have a Conception of what is doing and what you cannot miss to hear talked of and if you would lay out a Trifle on a Map of  Europe  in general and of the particular Countries likewise and consult your Maps for every Thing  you read about it would be a very fine and no unprofitable Amusement for by this Means and as it were by Way of Diversion you would come to understand Geography and comprehend what is now so much in the Mouths of all the World This would give you the Pleasure of understanding what you hear and read of forming with some Exactness an Idea of the Countries and Actions you read of which none can do who know not the Situations of Places where the Scene of Action lies Such Persons as know not for Example where  France Spain Italy Germany Hungary Prussia  c are whether they lie East West North or South or how they lie in respect to each other or whether they are near or far off what Pleasure  can they have in  Prince Charles's  passing and repassing the  Rhine  or what Notion can they have of his Marches and the Marches of his Enemies Why really scarce any  I would not however have you be either a great Geographer or NewsMonger but this would not only be pleasant Amusement in idle Hours but would enable you to have right Notions and Ideas of Things that are often talked of Now this or some such Employ I would have you set apart only for the Hours you find yourself languid in but by no means let it encroach on the Times of Business and when you are more necessarily and more importantly engaged  There is another Thing in which Time that lies heavy on our Hands might be still more usefully employed and that is in doing some HandyWork I have many Times regretted that I never learned to do or make some useful Thing or other to fill up these tedious Intervals I have known Gentlemen learn to Draw or Play on some Instrument or Work at some useful Art especially  Turning  which is easily learned and I have seen a Lady lately sit five or six Hours at making Nets Flowering or Embroidering Such Employments as these often turn out advantageous Concerns to those who are not capable of high Pursuits and are happy Relaxations to those who are  I am your's very truly J P  LETTER CXLI  Oxon  Sept    Dear Nancy  I Wrote you three Days ago what I have more to say will not take up much Time but I shall spin it out to two Letters  One Thing earnestly to be recommended as the Means of making either Study or Business useful and effectual is to improve the Times and Circumstances that favour them There are certain Seasons and Occasions by and  in which we can profit more than others I do not only mean what I wrote formerly about the proper Times of the Day for this or that and the Times when we find ourselves in the best Disposition or when the best Opportunities offer tho' these are to be greatly noticed yet I now mean something more  There are Accidents or Circumstances that contribute much to make deep Impressions on the Mind and Memory For Example when we hear any Thing that is  new  to us this excites the Curiosity and is a proper Time to inform ourselves about it When a Thing is strange or surprising or when it comes newly in Vogue or when we hear  many People talk about a Book or other Matter or commend or discommend it or when we hear different Characters of some Circumstance or Author or when People contest and dispute about any Thing then the Mind is excited and such Opportunities of Improvement are never to be neglected unless the Subject is of no Concern but even in that Case People will remember or be curious to know Things in such Circumstances  Not only Things that are new uncommon or extraordinary make deep Impressions but what we learn hear read or do at such Times make deep Impressions too There is a certain Connection of Ideas that I cannot account  for by which they are drawn along as by a Chain of different Links You have heard People say  I remember such a Circumstance very well because such a Thing happened at that Time or I was in such a Place  If we change our usual Place of Residence or our customary Way of Life we shall for some little While remember better what happened or what we read heard or saw in that Interval than what occurs ordinarily and I have often observed when I have come to a Place or Company from which I had been some Time absent my former Thoughts have then come back into my Mind tho' perhaps I had never once reflected on them from the Time  I had been before in that Place or Company  It is for this Reason that those who teach  the Art of Memory  lay down this Rule namely that  when we have many Things to remember we should join the Idea of some very known Place Person or Circumstance to the Thing we would remember  and we even see People who never studied Rules very commonly use this Method How often have we heard People say  This that or the other Circumstance will make me remember her such a Particular or such or such a Thing recalls it to my Mind  I am  my Dear  Yours sincerely J P  LETTER CXLII  Oxon  Sept    THE next Thing I would recommend is to conquer that Indolence which some People are either constitutionally or habitually encumbered with I know this is a very hard Lesson and what I could never absolutely be Master of myself What is accompanied with Difficulties or what is not to our Taste we bring ourselves to do with great Reluctance and we satisfy ourselves with any Sort of Excuse to put it off and delay it from Time to Time I have often experienced this in myself but if  the Thing we thus fly from is either necessary or proper we ought by all Means to compel ourselves to do it and even offer Violence to our Tempers to overcome this Indolence The best Method I know for this is to take the first Opportunity when we are in a proper Disposition and  to make a Beginning  Thus all the Poets and Philosophers advise  Ovid  says "He who has made a good Beginning has halfended his Business"  "Dimidium Qui bene caepit habet"  Horace  and  Perseus  say the same  Incipe  that is  Begin  is their constant Rule I will not give you the Translation of a noble Passage from  Horace  it is so wretchedly rendered but  one of our Poets says much to the same Purpose  Begin  Defer not till tomorrow to be wise  Tomorrow's Sun to thee may never rise  There is indeed nothing like making once a Beginning in earnest for by little and little we are reconciled to the Subject and Task Then Difficulties begin to vanish at least they grow smoother and easier by Degrees especially if we set our Hearts to conquer them and so what was once our Aversion becomes at last easy and often a Pleasure to us  The next Point to be observed is to conquer our Curiosity When we find  our Hearts set upon some Reading Business or Diversion that is improper we should endeavour to master that Passion and make it submit to our Advantage otherwise every new Thing that surprises us or that we are fond of will make us break off and turn away from the Pursuit of what is useful to us  But in either Case that is when our Indolence Aversion or Curiosity is so strong that we cannot conquer it at once we ought to do it by Degrees We may be in so unfit a Disposition that our Struggling can do us no Good at one Time then perhaps we had better give Way for that Instant resolving not to yield it up but get the better by Degrees I have been seized with such  a strong Curiosity that if I had not indulged it for that Time all other Applications had been useless for Example on Receipt of some extraordinary News or Letters long expected and often on Receipt of Letters from you that tho' I had compelled myself not to read them which I could have done yet I could not have done any Thing else to Purpose 'till I had perused them so much have they ran in my Head  I am  my Dear  Yours J P  LETTER CXLIII  Oxen  Sept    Dear Nancy  THE last Point I would recommend in Study or Business is what we call  Method  The chief Rule herein where the Nature of the Study requires it is to get a general Idea of our SubjectMatter in all its different Parts When we have seen through it we should range those Parts in some Order and fix them in our Mind Thus seen through the Affair will become much easier Were we even but learning  some new Game at Cards it may be reasonably imagined that this Method will make us comprehend it much better and more easily  Our next Care is to be Master of the chief Difficulties which will still obstruct our Knowledge and hang a dead Weight upon us in the Course of our Studies if not absolutely mastered For Instance in the French Language those who will not be at the Pains to get the two Auxiliary Verbs  Avoir  and  Etre  perfectly at first will find a heavy Clog lie upon them through the whole Study of that Tongue which will cost them ten Times the Pains that would be necessary to learn them perfectly at first  You know yourself that there are some Rules of Practice which make Things easy and without which we may puzzle our whole Life over without coming to our Purpose or at best spend a long Time and bestow vast Labour in resolving them By common Arithmetick we may blacken many Sheets of Paper and bestow many Hours nay even Days to resolve a Question which by Decimals or Algebra may be resolved in a few Minutes But to illustrate this by an Instance familiar to yourself how many Tricks at Cards have you shewed me that I could never find out or account for unless you had pointed out the Method  I shall take Occasion soon to transcribe the four famous Rules of  DesCartes  and with them shall finish this Subject  I am  my dearst Nancy  yours J P  LETTER CXLIV  Oxon  Oct    My dear Nancy  YOU say there is Part of a former Letter which you do not clearly comprehend and I can perceive that you think I have given contradictory  Rules though you do not so express yourself I proceed to explain it  There is a great Difference between conquering or subduing our Passions and extinguishing them It is certainly our Duty to be Masters of our Passions and Appetites but not to extinguish them for they were given us by the wise Author of our Nature for excellent Purposes Without them we should never be at Pains to do any good or great Action and therefore when they are subservient to our Reason they bear the Mind up against Fatigue Indolence and Inapplication but they make sad Work when they reign and tyrannize over us What  Horace  has said of Anger may be said of every Passion and Appetite I must  give it you in the disadvantageous Translation of  Creech  Anger it a short Frenzy curb thy Soul  And check thy Rage which must be rul'd or rule  Use all thy Art with all thy Force restrain  And take the strongest Bit and firmest Rein  It is certain that if we do not get the Mastery of our Passions they will be our Masters  They must be ruled or rule  Now to apply this to the Difficulty you propose  It is most certainly a proper Opportunity to learn a Thing when our Curiosity is excited by some Accident Then the Application will be vigorous the  Impressions deep and will continue long Yet notwithstanding this  Reason  which is the  Image of God  in our Minds and which distinguishes us from all the lower Creation  Reason  I say should preside and controul  If the Thing our Curiosity is employed about is worth our While we may then give the Reins to our Curiosity otherwise let us call in Reason to our Aid let her keep her Seat and do her Office We must then  take our strongest Bit and firmest Rein  This is a Metaphor you see taken from riding The Rider is our Reason the Horse the Passions which we must sometimes give the Reins to sometimes check sometimes spur and switch but at all Times  direct and manage You perceive all this agrees with what was first said namely that the Passions are to be governed moderated and subdued but not extinguished any more than a Horse instead of being broke and trained ought to be knocked on the Head or all the Blood in the Body let out to cure a Fever or the Head to be cut off to cure a Vertigo  Again there is a great Difference between some strong and sudden Gusts and Fits of Passion Curiosity for Instance and an habitual Dominion of the Passions over us The best and wisest of Men may be now and then surprized as the best Rider may be thrown when  he is not on his Guard especially now I say in such a Case for Example if a strong Fit of Curiosity possesses us which we cannot conquer as in the Particulars I mentioned to you it is better to yield a little for the Time than to struggle in vain yet by no Means to let it run into a Habit but resume the Reins as soon as possible Just so there are sometimes Fits of Indolence Indisposition Weariness and Listlessness if I may call it so which seize us and must be yielded Way to for a short Time but if encouraged are considerably more dangerous than the other and for this good Reason that all active Passions such as Curiosity decrease in Time and wear out or grow weaker by their  own Activity as Things in Motion tend to Rest at last but Indolence the more it is humoured the more it grows as Things at Rest never tend to Motion again of themselves but must be put into Motion by a new Force and if they are heavy Bodies the longer they lie on the Earth the deeper they sink into if This common and daily Experience shews us  I am  my dear Nancy  ever yours J P  LETTER CXLV  Oxon  Oct    Dear Nancy  I Shall now give you the famous Mons  DesCartes  four Rules of Method  Rule I  To admit nothing for Truth but what you hare fully examined and found to be so true as that you have no Reason to doubt it and to conclude nothing absolutely but what you see clearly to follow from what you have so considered  This Rule is of excellent Use to find out the Truth in Things of Difficulty or to attain to the Knowledge of what requires Application But I must warn you that there are many Things where this is not necessary as in Things  qui sautent aux Yeux  as the French say Things clear and obvious in themselves or Things that commonly occur in Life or are generally known and practised and in Things that do not concern you whether they be true or false and in many trifling Matters For Want of this Precaution I have heard of some Admirers of  DesCartes  who have run into unaccountable Follies and have given themselves great Disquiet in applying his Rules on every Occasion and have  thereby made their Lives a Burthen to selves  Rule II  That all the Difficulties you are to examine be divided into such and so many Parts as are necessary in order to attain the Knowledge of what you pursue  I shall say nothing on this Rule I think the Usefulness of it is very plain  Rule III  To dispose all the Particulars you are to consider in the most natural Order  That is you are to consider the more simple and plain Things before the more compounded and perplexed those  that are necessary to be first understood before those that arise out of them For Example in Arithmetic which you understand a little  A NumerationTable stands first then we learn to add Numbers to Numbers the next Thing that naturally follows is to take Numbers from Numbers which is most easily learned after we have learned to add Numbers This is called Substraction After this Multiplication becomes familiar and easy then follows Division which requires both Addition Subtraction and Multiplication in the Operation  In  Euclid  's famous Principles of the Mathematics called his  Elements  he proceeds  in this admirable Method His first Proposition is necessary to the understanding the second the second to the third the third to the fourth and so on This I think sufficient to explain what I mean  This Rule however only holds good in Things that have a Relation or Connection and Dependence on one another As for Example in learning  French  as I said before we shall be continually at a Loss if we do not make ourselves Masters of the auxiliary Verbs  avoir  and  √©tre  because they run into every Verb Yet I think the surest Way to get the  French  is to begin after these two Verbs with the other Verbs regular and irregular though they are much  harder than Nouns Pronouns  c  The Reason is there is no such necessary Connection between these and Verbs that they must be learned first in order to gain the other and as we remember best what we learn first in the Study of Languages I am firmly of Opinion that Verbs ought to be first attained  Rule IV  To be sure to omit nothing necessary to be taken into the Consideration of the Question you are in Search of or the Attainment of what you want to know  How many People have laboured in vain to come to the Ground of a Difficulty or even attain the Understanding of an  Art or Trade perfectly by not observing this Rule and perhaps omitting one necessary Thing which made all the rest defective  Some People have thought a fifth Rule necessary and indeed I am one of them  Rule V  To separate every thing from the Question that is not pertinent to the Resolution of the Difficulty  I have often thought this Rule as necessary as any of the others When we take any foreign Matter into the State of a Question or Study of a Point it embarrasses and perplexes us and carries  us away on a wrong Scent You cannot fail to have observed this in People whose Passions Prejudices Inattention Ignorance or Mistakes lead them away from the Point in Question and make them wander quite from the true State of it  The learned have stated two Kinds of Reasoning in the Mind Discourse or Method as they call it My next shall be on that Subject but I shall be very short and then I have done  J P  LETTER CXLVI  Oxon  Oct    THE two Methods I mentioned my dear Nancy are termed by the Learned the Analytic Method and the Synthetic Method These are two Greek Words The first signifies no more in plain English than to resolve or separate and take into Pieces the latter to compound or lay together and in all Things that we would learn or know one or other of these must be followed for we must either separate the Subject into different Parts and consider those distinctly or we must put them together  and consider them jointly and see what will be the Result  But these two Methods are not indifferent to every Sort of Subject The Nature of some requires to be considered analytically others synthetically and to come at the Knowledge of some Things both must be used  In Grammar that is the learning of a Language the analytical Method is used to understand to read write or speak a Language we consider the different Parts of Speech as Nouns Pronouns Verbs  c  In Nouns we consider the Substantives and Adjectives we divide them into declinable and indeclinable we divide the Declensions consider  the different Cases Numbers Genders and so forth In Pronouns we consider the first second and third Person the demonstrative relative and possessive Verbs we divide into regular and irregular then into active passive neuter and reciprocal then we consider them in their different Moods Tenses Persons and Numbers This is sufficient to make you apprehend the Usefulness of this Method called analytical  In Logic that is the Art of Reasoning we proceed in another Manner Here we begin with simple Perception or what is called a single Idea Then we proceed to Judgment that is considering two Ideas together and comparing them and finding the Relation or  Want of Relation between them For Example when we consider the Ideas of Fire and Heat together we pronounce "that Fire is hot" When we consider and compare the Ideas we have of God and Death or Sin we find a Want of Relation or an Incompatibility between them hence we pronounce  God is not subject to Death or to Sin  When we have thus formed a Judgment we can go further and carry on our Reasoning in a Chain as thus  If God cannot sin he must necessarily be good if he cannot die he must be eternal  This is called Discourse which Word does not properly signify  talking  as we use it but reasoning and laying Things together or  separating them and so finding out Inferences  We then proceed to  Method  which is ordering and disposing our Thoughts so as best to attain the Knowledge of what we want to find out by either or both of the aforementioned Ways and all the Art of Logic depends on these four Operations on the Mind to wit Perception Judgment Discourse and Method  Thus in Geometry a  Point  is first considered next to that a  Line  which is a Continuation of Points this gives us the Idea of Length the next is the Idea of Breadth from these two we have the Idea of  Surface  and when to  Length and Breadth we take in Depth we get the Idea of a  Solid  From these Ideas arise all our Notions of Squares Curves Triangles Cubes  c  with all their Proportions and Relations  You have now I doubt not a just Notion of what is called analytical what synthetical and of the Usefulness of their different Operations  I said that in some Studies both Methods may be necessary and they may be so either in some different Parts of a long or intricate Question or even sometimes to the right understanding of the whole  To give the best Idea hereof that I can take this familiar Illustration  Suppose you wanted to know the Machinery and Movements of a Watch it would be necessary to take the whole Movement in Pieces before you to explain the Use of every Part to make you observe the Shape Form and Figure of each to shew you how it is fitted for such or such an Use or Purpose and how its Structure contributes to this Use This is the  Analytical  Method But to make you understand it perfectly would it not think you be proper to put it together again before you and to shew you thereby how each Part corresponded with and related to another and how from that Construction and Composition the  Motions arise and were continued and conducted to the End for which a Watch was designed This is the  Synthetical  Method  In such an Operation as this we have Occasion to consider every thing duly and so to admit nothing to be true that is to say fit for the Purpose it is said to be designed for unless it evidently appears so Here then is a Distribution of the Subject into as many Parts as are necessary the simple Parts are first considered then the Connection with others then these Parts as compounded and lastly the whole Frame Composition or System Now if all these are duly considered a nice Discerner will find out what is  wanting and by that Means will omit nothing that is necessary to the Perfection of the Machine and if there is any thing amiss or superfluous he will be sensible that it is to be altered or removed Herein then are the whole five Rules of Method mentioned in my former Letter comprized  If Mr  Greme  the best WatchMaker perhaps that ever was in the World had not seen many Watches both taken asunder and put together and had not considered every Part nicely by itself and the whole when united he would never have been able to remove some Things and to add or alter others as he has often done to amazing Advantage  I shall add no more on this Subject only recommend a Treatise of Mr  Locke  's called  The Conduct of the Understanding  Adieu  my dear Nancy  J P  LETTER CXLVII  Oxon  Oct    My dear Nancy  I AM very well pleased with your Observations on  Tasso  they are both ingenious and just and no Critic needs be ashamed of them  Since I wrote you last our Professor of Poetry had a public Speech It was on the Figure  Prosopopea  This is in plain English  imagining  a Person and directing our Discourse to him He divided it into two Kinds either applying to a Person absent or to an inanimate Thing as if it were a living Person  This Division is well understood and very common Thousands of Instances of both Kinds are to be found in  Homer Virgil Ovid Milton  c Of the first Sort there is an Instance near the Beginning of the first Book of the  Aeneid  where  Aeneas  invokes  Tydides  as if he were present but it is much stronger expressed in the Original than  in the Translation A noble Instance of the second Sort is in the fourth Book of  Paradise Lost  where  Satan  addresses himself to the  Sun  and in another Place where  Eve  talks to the Flowers Trees and Brooks from which she is about to be banished  But our Professor's chief Design was to shew that there were more strong more grand and more emphatical Figures of this Kind in the  Holy Scriptures  than in all the Poets put together For Instance  Hear O Heaven and give Ear O Earth  Jeremiah  addresses himself to the Sword of the  Lord  "which" he says  thirsteth for Blood  and to his Arrows which he calls "the Children of his Quiver" He  quoted many more all very strong and emphatical and shewed us some of the finest  Prosopopea's  mixed with the strongest and most expressive Metaphors and other Figures But he insisted chiefly on a Passage in the Song of  Deborah  and  Sirak  where they do not make a  Prosopopea  to the Mother of  Sisera  but imagine her talking to her Ladies and thence so impatient as to answer herself  The Mother of  Sisera  looked out at a Window and cried through the Lattice  Why is his Chariot so long in coming Why tarry the Wheels of his Chariot  Her wise Ladies answered herYea she returned Answer to herself  Have they not sped Have they not divided the Prey to every Man a Damsel or two To  Sisera  a Prey of divers Colours a Prey of divers Colours of NeedleWork of divers Colours of NeedleWork on both Sides meet for the Necks of them that take the Spoil  Chap  v Ver  He  observed the Impatience of a Mother for the Return of her Son her looking out at the Lattice her asking her Ladies her returning Answer to herself and then the Particulars that ran most in her Head not Conquest nor Glory but captive Damsels and fine gorgeous Raiment with an Imagination so warm and full that she describes them as minutely as if she had seen them This he said was natural to the Sex quoted a similar Passage in  Virgil  where  Camilla  is so blinded with the Armour of  Arunces  that it occasions her to lose her Life He then made an unfavourable Reflection namely how much the female Sex is taken up with Toys and gaudy Trifles a Reflection which I flatter myself will  never with any Justice be applied to you  Adieu  my dearest  J P  Soon after the Date of this Letter the Lady had the Affliction to lose her valuable revered and muchlamented Tutor Guardian Friend and Parent  FINIS  The following BOOKS are this Day published for JOHN BELL near  ExeterExchange  in the
